Calls to smp_call_function() with interrupts off or spinlocks held
typically causes deadlocks on SMP systems. ISTR debugging such an
issue in the scheduler a while back, i.e. mmdrop() under rq->lock
doing vfree() of an LDT. Basically smp_call_function() will spin
waiting for the other cpus to answer the interrupt on multiple cpus.
It also doesn't need to be the same function doing smp_call_function();
generally TLB flushing deadlocks against anything doing this.
