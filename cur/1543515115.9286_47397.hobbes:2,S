Xircom PCMCIA 10/100 Combo with 56K modem appears to be affected. Tested with
2.2.3, 2.2.7, 2.2.10 on Compaq Armada and HP Omnibook. (Debian 2.1, pcmcia
3.0.x rebuilt for 2.2.x  or 3.1.1) appears to be affected. Sorry but did not
have time to go testing in depth thought of doing it over the weekend.
