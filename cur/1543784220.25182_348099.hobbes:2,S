Giri, I'm not attacking your project. You know I'm sharing your
pragmatic view. Performance is a pure technical issue.
Yes, I can provide some numbers around atheros devices (10-20%
speed-up). And yes, I can explain why ndiswrapper suffers from certain
differences of the NDIS driver model compared to the one of Linux
(just consider what had to be moved to tasklets). But I think this
would better be continued on the ndiswrapper list than here.
