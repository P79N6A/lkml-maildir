Sure it does. Note the "lock" in find_lock_page(). It will lock the page,
which implies sleeping if somebody is accessing it at the same time.
If you don't want to sleep, you need to use one of the wrappers for
"__find_page_nolock()". Something like "find_get_page()", which only
"gets" the page.
The naming actually does make sense in this area.
