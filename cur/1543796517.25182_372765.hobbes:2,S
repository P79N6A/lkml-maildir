Thanks, missed it in the config.
A change suggestion for the UML config:
Alter config explanation for UBD (blockdevices/virtual block device) to:
Always do synchonous disk IO for UBD (needed for UML!)
Because at this moment it is easier to find by editing the generated .config 
file instead of by using the kernel configuration tools.
