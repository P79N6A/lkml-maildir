Come on Jeff, don't be such a slave to the hardware specifications. Just
because it's possible to send down 32MB requests doesn't necessarily
mean it's a super thing to do, nor that it automagically makes 'things
go faster'. The claim is that back-to-back 1MB requests are every bit as
fast as a 32MB request (especially if you have a small queue depth, in
that case there truly should be zero benefit to doing the bigger ones).
The cut-off point is likely even lower than 1MB, I'm just using that
figure as a value that is 'pretty big' yet doesn't incur too large
latencies just because of its size.
