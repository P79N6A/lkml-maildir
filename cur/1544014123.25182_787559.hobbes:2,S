Hi Sam,
	Thanks for the review comments. I am resending the patch with the changes
you have recommended.
Impact: Fix the VIOPATH dependency in the iSeries dependent drivers.
iSeries depend drivers build fails, when CONFIG_VIOPATH is disabled.
Removing the dependency of VIOPATH by selecting it, when the drivers
dependent on iSeries code.
