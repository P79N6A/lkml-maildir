I would still recommend the arrangement for 64-bit dev_t that I posted
a while ago:
dev_t<63:40> := major<31:8>
dev_t<39:16> := minor<31:8>
dev_t<15:8>  := major<7:0>
dev_t<7:0>   := minor<7:0>
No aliasing, no forbidden bit patterns, no conditional code, no need
for magic numbers, and it's fully compatible with the current
LSB-adjusted user space dev_t format. I also posted i386 code for the
various operations to show that they really can be done with very
little code.
If you want, you can even make it 32-bit-friendly, although it makes
it more complex; for example, this version would implement 32-bit with
a 12:20 split:
dev_t<63:44> := major<31:12>
dev_t<43:32> := minor<31:20>
dev_t<31:28> := major<11:8>
dev_t<27:16> := minor<19:8>
dev_t<15:8>  := major<7:0>
dev_t<7:0>   := minor<7:0>
