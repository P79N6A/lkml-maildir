Hi,
I've just tried 2.6.1-rc1-mm2 and noticed that I can no longer get the
battery status through ACPI (/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state reports only
zeros). While my dsdt may be a bit buggy, it worked fine with 2.6.1-rc1,
so there seems to be a regression somewhere. I haven't tried earlier -mm
patches though.
I'm running Fedora Core 1 on Dell Latitute D600 (Pentium M 1.6, 1 GB
RAM). I can do more testing if that's useful.
