The GPL gives special exception to system libraries which a GPL'd program must
link against in order to run.  The fact that the DDK doesn't come with the base
OS is not an issue - Solaris doesn't ship with a C compiler, but that doesn't
preclude distribution of GPL'd programs in binary form for Solaris (though it
helps that there are free C compilers for Solaris, but there's probably no free
substitute for ntddll.dll, unless Cygnus have done something clever).
