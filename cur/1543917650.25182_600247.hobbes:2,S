> Could a router problem prevent "ping 127.0.0.1" from working ?
Two things that are new and could cause these problems:
1) We dynamically allocate the loopback device now.
2) We have the network namespace stuff.
Another change in this area is that we do routing cache
garbage collection from a workqueue instead of a timer
but that was a pretty straightforward transformation so
it is not high on my list of "suspects".
