It's finely balanced, but the module_param macro only skips the "&"
because it turns it into a name.  module_param_named() should probably
be changed to take a ptr too.  But you'll get a warning if you use the
interface wrong, so it's not a huge issue.
The balance is tipped here I think because the massive number of
functions we're starting to sprout into.
