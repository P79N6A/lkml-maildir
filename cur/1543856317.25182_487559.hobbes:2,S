Heh, I see this also with an Tyan S2866 (nforce4 chipset).  I've been
aware something is a miss for a while because if I transfer about 40GB
of data from one machine to another there are checksum mismatches and
some files have to be transfered again.
I've kept quite about it so far because it's not been clear what the
cause is and because i can mostly ignore it now that I checksum all my
data and check after xfer that it's sane (so I have 2+ copies of all
this stuff everywhere).

Sounds about the same occurance rate I see, 30-40GB xfer, one or two
pages (4K) are wrong.

For me it seems that a single block in the file would be bad and the
rest OK --- we I'm talking about 2 random blocks in 30BG or so.
