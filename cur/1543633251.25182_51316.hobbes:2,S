Very early, from my review :)

And this is the wrong focus (for me). I need documentation from the userspace 
view. The documentation I need shouldn't try to explain how the kernel works, 
except as  needed to understand what to do in userspace. My concept is 
something like the tutorial I am working on for Linux HID programming 
(explaination of the various interfaces and options - see 
http://www.frogmouth.net/hid-doco/linux-hid.html
 for an early draft).
Not to suggest we shouldn't document the kernel mechanics - this is important 
too.
But kernel programmers need to remember that user space programmers will take 
the path of least resistance when trying to interact with the kernel. Good 
documentation and easy-to-copy examples beats a slightly more powerful API 
(where slightly depends on being able to accomplish task in both APIs, even 
if it gets ugly) every time. If you want people to switch over to your new 
API/ABI, its got to be easy.
