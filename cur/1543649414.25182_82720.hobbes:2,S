"People" are entitled to agree with whomever they wish, including
Stallman.

No such thing was demonstrated.  That someone lacks the power to
silence critics does not imply that they lack the freedom to do
things that others criticize.

The ability to participate in Linux development without using BK
is not some benevolent gift, granted from on-high by Linus as a
favor to those who object to BK.  It is assured by the GPL regardless
of some specific developers policy with regard to what tools are
used.  No one had to "make certain that no one is forced."  The
power to "force" doesn't exist.
