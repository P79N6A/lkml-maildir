Sorry, my Web access is broken for now so I can't check, but I believe
that CVE number is for a different, older problem.
So AFAIK there are no CVE numbers for anything I sent (but there
probably should be.)  Generic Linux kernel developers don't have
a CVE representative, so we depend on vendors to assign numbers
and sometimes they don't.
