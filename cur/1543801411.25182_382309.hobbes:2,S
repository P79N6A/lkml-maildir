we can (almost) do that: via -ffunction-sections. It does seem to work 
on both the gcc and the ld side. [i tried to use this for --gc-sections 
to save more space, but that ld option seems unstable, i couldnt link a 
bootable image. -ffunction-sections itself seems to work fine in gcc4.]
i think all that is needed to reorder the functions is a build-time 
generated ld script, which is generated off the 'popularity list'.
so i think the two concepts could nicely co-exist: in-source annotations 
help us maintain the popularity list, -ffunction-sections allows us to 
reorder at link time. In fact such a kernel could be shipped in 
'unlinked' state, and could be relinked based on per-system profiling 
data. As long as we have KALLSYMS, it's not even a big debuggability 
issue.
the branch-likelyhood thing is a separate issue from function-cohesion, 
but could be handled by the same concept: if there was a 
--ffunction-unlikely-sections option in gcc (there's none currently, 
AFAICS), then those could be reordered in a smart way too. (We wouldnt 
get the 8-byte relative jumps back though, gcc would always have to 
assume that the jump is far away.)
