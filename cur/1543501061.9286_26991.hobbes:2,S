That sounds to me like a broken firewall
If there is traffic outside the firewall and there is no traffic inside
the firewall then the problem cause is rather obvious.
Try turning off sack paw paws and neighbour discovery. If that fixes it
tell em to fix their firewall and turn them back on.
echo "0" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack 
echo "0" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps
echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
If its a firewall built by incompetents then it might also be down to
it guessing port ranges for incoming/outgoing.
