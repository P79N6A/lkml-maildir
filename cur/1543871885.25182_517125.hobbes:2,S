So, I tracked this down to 2.6.21-git7, the first snapshot that gives me
this problem. Tellingly it does contain an input tree merge. I would git bisect
but I don't have a local copy of the tree - I tried to get one, but it stopped
halfway through the clone, probably because I had to use http... So, I hope that
helps.
