It will (should) at least show up as nicely as in the C source code.
With escape codes, but largely readable.
If someone knows how to directly spew it to tty0 (the current active console -
most likely tty1), the better.
Anyway, I just wanted to point out how to really highlight it for the user to
see. Although then there would be the distros who obscure it with funky
bootsplash screens. But hopefully, their users would not need to care too much
for old stuff (gets updated through the distro's update mechanism)
