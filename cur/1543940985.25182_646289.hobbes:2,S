In current implementation, change_page_attr() can be used to change
identity map only.  At least I can find __pa() are used in
change_page_attr_addr() to get physical address. So I think
change_page_attr() should be fixed firstly.

If the memory area be ioremap() has identity map too. We need two
set_memory_xxx(addr). That is, we need:
addr = ioremap(phys_addr, len);
set_memory_x(addr);
if (phys_addr < (end_pfn_mapped >> PAGE_SHIFT))
        set_memory_x(__va(phys_addr));
Maybe we can hide the fact of identity map into set_memory_xxx(), just
specify the physical address to set_memory_xxx() too.
