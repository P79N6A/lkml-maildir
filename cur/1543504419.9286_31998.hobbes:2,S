I don't see any glaring problems with the configs, though I may be blind
after today's work.  Have you tried:
1. Using an ethernet xover cable to wire one station directly to the
router, so the two stations don't see each others' MAC addresses, and
2. Swapping the "real" and alias addresses on the router interface so that
10.1.10.2 is not an alias?  
Doing these two things might help narrow down the search a little.  I'd
suspect that the stations seeing each others' real MAC addresses might
have something to do with it.  Alias addresses have worked fine for me in
the past, though I haven't tried using them in a 2.2 kernel.
Let me know what you find out.
