I'm not sure what you mean. There is nothing good to say about Ingo's
nice mechanism though (sorry Ingo, its otherwise a very nice
scheduler!).
In my scheduler, nice -20 processes get small timeslices so scheduling
latency stays low or even gets lower, while nice +19 ones get large
timeslices for lower context switches and better cache efficiency. As
you would like.
