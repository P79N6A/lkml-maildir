thanks, applied. The effect of this bug is that block-stepping is not 
disabled ... [~TIF_DEBUGCTLMSR masks out bit 25, while in the MSR we 
want to mask out bit 1]
Roland - i guess this means block-stepping (a new ptrace feature in .25) 
is not particularly well-tested. Do you have any standalone testcases 
that could be run?
