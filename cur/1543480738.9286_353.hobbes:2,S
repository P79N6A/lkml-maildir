The kernel caches inodes.  If you increase the maximum size  of the
inode table, then it will continue to grow. :)
However, for nr_inodes to exceed max_inodes, we must be failing to reap
the inode cache aggressively enough.  What sort of load are you running
under?
The simple cure is not to increase inode-max.  The kernel will still let
the inode cache grow above inode-max if it really neads to, but will
reap things much more aggressively above that limit.
