Detail why. The code of execvp()? Passing in the buffer?
I'm not saying it's the brightest code around here, but it's ok for me.

I initially thought to design a two-steps API with a "which" operation (where 
memory allocation was used) to call later execvp(); when I saw the glibc 
implementation (it allocates one single fixed-size buffer) I saw it was 
simpler this way.
Additionally, error handling cannot be done properly without trying an exec - 
I think it is also ok to drop this execvp semantic, so that if the first 
binary found in path is marked executable but has the wrong binary format the 
whole thing just does not start.
The current implementation already diverges from glibc - it never calls 
directly the shell passing a script, because IMHO execve() will care for that 
(and testing confirmed this IIRC).
I'd not do that at boot, but just before the fork()+execve() - it is 
conceivable that a given user will install a support binary after booting 
UML.
I must say that I've seen files without the shebang working ok (if having the 
executable bit set) when executed from the shell, and I've had the doubt 
execvp() would handle that.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
