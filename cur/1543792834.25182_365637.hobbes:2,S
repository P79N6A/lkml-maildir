Ok, I got a little bit more forward.
I created entry like this:
        {
                .mfr_id         = 0x00b0,
                .dev_id         = 0x00b0,
                .name           = "Collie hack",
                .uaddr          = {
                        [0] = MTD_UADDR_UNNECESSARY,    /* x8 */
                },
                .DevSize        = SIZE_4MiB,
                .CmdSet         = P_ID_INTEL_EXT,
                .NumEraseRegions= 1,
                .regions        = {
                        ERASEINFO(0x10000,8),
                }
}
(Which is probably wrong, I just made up the data), and set name in
collie.c to "jedec_probe". That made jedec_probe.c go alive, and it
prints...
Found: Collie hack
sa1100-0: Found 4 x8 devices at 0x0 in 32-bit bank
Sum of regions (200000) != total size of set of interleaved chips (1000000)
gen_probe: No Supported Vendor Command set found
sharp.c sets
			width = 4;
                        mtd->erasesize = 0x10000 * width / 2;
                        mtd->size = 0x800000 * width / 2;
...that is
		width = 4;
		erazesize = 0x20000;
		size      = 0x1000000;
Does it mean ERASEINFO(0x20000,7) should do the trick?

Thanks, Sharp!
