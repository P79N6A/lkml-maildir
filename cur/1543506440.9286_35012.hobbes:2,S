I'm trying to write a kernel driver to talk to a SCSI device. I've taken a
look through the tape, CDRom and SCSI generic source, and while the SCSI
Generic is probabbly the easiest one to read, it's gonna take me a while
to figure out what parts of the structures and what functions I need to
call to make the underlying SCSI interface do my commands.
Is there any documentation anywhere for what order the functions need to
be called in, and what parameters in the structures need to be filled in?
Thanks.
