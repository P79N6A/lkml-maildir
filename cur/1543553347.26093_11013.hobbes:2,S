Hi Rik,
A simple test seems to show problems with page allocator.
a) take a 6G RAM machine
b) take a 70G harddisk
c) mke2fs on it
observe lots of "0-order allocation failures" while looking at
/proc/meminfo reveals that I still have 5.1G of free memory (presumably
some of it in NORMAL zone, not just all HIGH)... Isn't buddy allocator
clever enough to break up the multi-page chunks if we need single pages?
I don't know.
Regards,
Tigran
