My previous replly was targeted more to the comments of R. Polton where
sysreq still functioned but was unable to sync the disk netscape was
reading/writing.  The fix for this one was posted by DaveM and is in
the test9.prex kernels.
As for the hard lockups, I s'pose we can blame Rik. ;-)  I've been
loathe
to do so tho' because on my box the locks always occur with low memory
pressure.  I actually thought that he had them fixed with his vmpatch
cuz'
I didn't get any lockups with a heavier load.  Opening netscape, star
office
and doing repeated make clean/Build-kernels worked just fine.  Closed
star
office started compiling -pre9 went back to reading mail and zap;
lock-up.
It always happens the same although I can't repeat it on demand.  Start
a kernel compile and go read mail.  Somewhere upon switching mail
folders
in netscape it locks.  Box is _never_ under swap when this occurs.  Wish
it
would at least log _something_ to report.

Rik:  are you having fun yet?? ;-)
