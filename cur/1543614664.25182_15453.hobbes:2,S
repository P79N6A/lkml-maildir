Someone with far too much time on their hands would be my personal
hero[*] if they were to write a script (in language of their choice) to
parse a diff, extract filename, and do lookup in a flat text file
to find a list of maintainers/interested parties.
Imagine a patch against devfs..
$ cclist my.devfs.patch.diff
Richard Gooch <rgooch@atnf.csiro.au>
Alexander Viro <viro@math.psu.edu>
SCNR 8-)
This 'little black book of addresses' doesn't have to be anything
wonderful, but its tedious work for someone to make the textfile
mapping the various source files to email addresses.
Someone (Alan?) suggested having something like a web interface
allowing anyone interested in any particular file to register
their interest, and get added to the cclist for that file.
Which is also a cool idea.
Dave.
[*] At least for a while. I'm fickle.
