Not really.  They care about throughput, and will happily sacrifice
latency for that.  The postmark stuff showed that very clearly --- by
yielding in transaction commit and allowing multiple transactions to
batch up, Andrew saw an instant improvement of about 3000% in postmark
figures, despite the fact that the yield is obviously only going to
increase the latency of each individual transaction.  Pretty much all
TP benchmarks focus on throughput, not latency.
So while latency is important, if we have to tradeoff against
throughput, that is normally the right tradeoff on synchronous write
traffic.  For reads, latency is obviously critical in nearly all
cases.
Cheers,
 Stephen
