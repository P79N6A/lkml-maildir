Cut-n-paste from previous answer to the same problem:
Since Linux 2.6.10-rcX. packets from a tunnel-mode SA are dropped if
no policy exists. You most likely only have an input policy, but no
forward policy. If you use setkey to configure your policies,
duplicate the input policy and replace "-P in" with "-P fwd". If you
let racoon generate the policy you need to upgrade to the latest
version. pluto should already get it right.
