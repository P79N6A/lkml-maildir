Hi, I've got a K6III-400 with Asus P5A and IBM 10Gb, 7200rpm ide.
I've got to use Kernel 2.3.x because it's the only supporting ALI-1543 udma
feature, but I've found no difference using hdparm -X34 and -X66 (btw hdparm is
rev3.5 and has been recompiled after kernel build): just the same transfert
rate, T=64_Mb/s and t=12.65Mb/s.
It's not just a matter of numbers: the system has no speed improvement at all
(ie: tsarting X, compiling the kernel, etc.)
 /proc/ide/ide0/hda/driver shows ide-disk version 1.09 and /proc/ide/ali is
attacched. What can be the reason for this?
Thanks in advance for help. If this is not pertinent to the list, please reply
directly (I'm not a subscriber) and accept my apologies
