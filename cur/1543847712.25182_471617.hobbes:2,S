Got it. Try
http://t-mobile.cz/Web/ClientFunction.DownloadFile.axd?FileID=2f0a8bc5-b60d-406a-8dde-8b002706799a
 
it is linked from 
http://t-mobile.cz/Web/Residential/TarifySluzby/Internet-a-e-mail/co-delat-kdyz-nelze-pouzit-wnw-manager.aspx
link is "Ovladac pro ... 4G ... Linux".
Driver is GPL, can you post it to lkml when you get it from their
.rar, etc?
