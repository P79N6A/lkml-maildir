Umm.. if you actually *read* the mentioned thread, you'll see that "existing
patches" are known to be incomplete, complete with the "upchucks in the binary"
(mentioned at entry number 9 of the thread), and that Zander already knows
about it (entry #11), and has apparently one remaining issue left to resolve
(entries #32 and #36).
And entry #36 is what the NVidia engineer doing the work was thinking about
20 hours ago.  Interpret it as you will...
