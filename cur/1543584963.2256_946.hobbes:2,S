Excuse me, but doesn't it scream "userland"? IOW, is there any reason to
do that in the kernel? If you want to spread /etc/fstab all over the
place storing bits in relevant filesystems - fine, you even don't
need to bother with superblocks. Just teach mount(8) to put the
mountpoint into /.last.mounted and be done with that...
	It's a policy question - if somebody wants to play with such
schemes he can do it in the place where policy stuff belongs.
I.e. in userland. Since the reading side contains a bunch of heuristics
(obviously depending on the local naming policy for temp. mountpoints,
for one thing) you don't need anything special on the writing side...
