I have discovered a problem with the patch I posted here.  With the
patch applied, umount aborts if it is called without "-n" and the mtab
file is not writable.  This is different from the current behavior of
the umount program and, I have discovered, there are scripts out there
that run umount without "-n" when the root filesystem is mounted
read-only.  So I have changed the patch to make umount not abort if
mtab is not writable and "-n" is not specified.
