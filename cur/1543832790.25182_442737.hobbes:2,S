Subject: [PATCH 00/10] Kernel memory leak detector 0.8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/10/360

This is a new version (0.8) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the whole patch or the
broken-out series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.18-rc1-kmemleak-0.8.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patches-kmemleak-0.8.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- reviewers comments implemented
- added support for type ids (currently approximated by sizeof)
- NUMA support
- reduced the memory allocation/freeing overhead by adding the
  pointer aliases to the radix tree only when scanning the memory
- improved documentation and in-code comments
To do:
- more testing
- more investigation into the task stacks scanning
- precise type identification (after first assessing the efficiency of
  the current method as it requires changes to the kernel API)
- (support for ioremap tracking)
