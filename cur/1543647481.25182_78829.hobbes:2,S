afaict, that code only wants an inode because it is borrowing
the pagecache functions for page lookup.  It's using i_ino as
a search key too.  It has no superblock.
Solutions might be: 1) allocate a private <int key, radix tree>
structure or 2) require that these inodes come from hugetlbfs,
although the "key" makes that a bit tricky.
