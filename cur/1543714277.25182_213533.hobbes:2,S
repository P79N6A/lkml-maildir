Subject: [PATCH] PCI MSI Kconfig consolidation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/13/101

This consolidates the PCI MSI configuration into drivers/pci/Kconfig,
removing it from the i386, x86_64, and ia64 Kconfig.
It also changes the default for ia64 from "y" to "n".  The default on
i386 is "n" already, and I'm not sure why ia64 should be different.
