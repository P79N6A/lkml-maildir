It would have taken less time for the people who removed the firmware and
will assure support for their users to disassemble this code and put labels
and comments in it. When I was 16, I totally disassembled my PC's bios (8kB)
commented it and labelled it to the point of making it re-assemblable. It
did not take very much time (a week-end), and it was crappy x86 code with
unaligned and mangled code/data + hard-coded stack values for the "calls"
without any RAM usage. Here you have about 2kB of clean MIPS code which is
about 500 instructions (500 lines). I doubt anyone knowing mips assembly
enough would spend more than a week-end putting comments and labels in it.
Now another possibility would be for those zealots to replace the firmware
by an open-source one such as 
http://alteon.shareable.org/
 which BTW contains
all the tools needed for the dirty work.
Anyway, this thread is getting boring...
