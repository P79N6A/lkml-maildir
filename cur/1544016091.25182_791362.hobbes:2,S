Adding a barrier shouldn't be that hard; just a matter adding a call
to blkdev_issue_flush() to ext2_sync_file() before it returns.
BTW, I think there's a stale documentation bug in in
block/blk-barrier.c, around line 305:
  * Description:
  *    Issue a flush for the block device in question. Caller can supply
  *    room for storing the error offset in case of a flush error, if they
- *    wish to.  Caller must run wait_for_completion() on its own.
+ *    wish to.

 int blkdev_issue_flush(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t *error_sector)

Jens, is that right?
