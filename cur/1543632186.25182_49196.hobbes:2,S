It makes it faster to analyze.  I would have appreciated that in doing
my own analysis.  If Linus incorporated the whole thing without analyzing
its structure, I'd be worried.
The only problem would be that this kind of breakup and convenience of
applying the patch tend to be mutually exclusive.  I suppose that could
be solved with a script Keith's end - simply append all the broken-apart
pieces into one large patch (in fact, it seems that two of the tree
patches you need to apply for the i386 version would be better appended
together for the purpose of distribution.)
The question of how much work it is to do the breakup itself is separate.
In my experience, maintaining a system in a broken-up form tends to be
a major use of time.  It's something you want to do once, just before
inclusion, and that seems to be exactly what Linus has asked for.

See above.  It's all about analyzing the structure of the patch.  To be
fair though, it took me less than an hour to get a pretty good idea of
how the current patch set is structured.
