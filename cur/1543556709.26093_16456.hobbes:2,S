Alan,
I am still seeing intermittent mouse problems with a PS2 mouse on a 
4 x PPro box with 2.2.18-24.  When the system is first powered up, 
the mouse detection is working great.  If I reboot the machine without
powering it down, about 1 in 3 times I do this, the next kernel load
fails to detect the mouse.  I have not looked at the driver to see
what state the Mouse port is in, but could.  
Is there something I could do to help you debug this problem (i.e.
is there somewhere in the kernel code I should put in some 
sanity checking to see if the mouse is being left in a good state.
Powering down the machine makes the problem go away.  Does not happen
on 2.4.0-12, BTW, just 2.2.18-24.
Jeff
