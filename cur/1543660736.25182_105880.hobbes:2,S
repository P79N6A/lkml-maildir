OK, well just for your info, I added an entry in the cputable for
rev2.1, identical flags to the 2.0 entry and nothing has changed. Still
no cpufreq data, case is still warm all over. I put debug messages in to
my pmac_cpufreq.c and I get the following:
HID1, before: 80016c0
HID1, after: 16080

Cool will do! I'd be very interested to see any ppc/powermac manuals you
may have. I've not been able to find much myself (just instruction
reference and stuff from motorola). If you could send me URLs that would
great.
