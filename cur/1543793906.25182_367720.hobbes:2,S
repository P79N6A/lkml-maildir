First, thanks for the prompt response.

My question was whether the one being defined to eth0 has an advantage 
over the one assigned to eth0:0 since one is real and one is virtual.  
My uninformed instinct told me to wonder if the NIC hardware itself 
somehow gets told to handle the IP assigned to eth0 and something in the 
linux software has to handle the IP assigned to eth0:0
I realize that the machine will have to do more work total.  But I 
wonder if it's any more work than if the server has two NICs with two 
different IPs.

It's necessary because of the in-born inability for name based virtual 
hosting to be done over SSL (though I think this inability was 
unnecessary in that it could have been relaxed if just a little bit of 
unsecured data could be transmitted in the SSL header allowing the 
server to make some decision based on that clear data.. but that's 
another matter).
Thanks again,
