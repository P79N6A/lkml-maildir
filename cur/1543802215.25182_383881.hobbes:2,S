for Opteron NUMA, need to update
0. stop the DCT on the node that will plug the new DIMM
1. read spd_rom for the added dimm
2. init the ram size and update the memory routing table...
3. init the timing...
4. update relate info in TOM and TOM2, and MTRR, and e820
It looks like we need to get some code about ram init from LinuxBIOS.....
