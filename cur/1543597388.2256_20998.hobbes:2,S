Consider the possibility (probability, I think) that SCSI drives blow 
away their (unwritten) write cache buffers on a SCSI bus reset, and 
that a SCSI bus reset is a routine, albeit last-resort, error 
recovery technique. (It's also necessary; by the time a driver gets 
to a bus reset, all else has failed. It's also, in my experience, not 
especially rare.)
The fix for that particular problem--disabling write caching--is 
simple enough, though it presumably has a performance consequence. A 
second benefit of disabling write caching is that the drive can't 
reorder writes (though of course the system still might).
At first glance, by the way, the only write barrier I see in the SCSI 
command set is the synchronize-cache command, which completes only 
after all the drive's dirty buffers are written out. Of course, 
without write caching, it's not an issue.
