  In file included from foo.c:2:
  /usr/include/linux/time.h:6: redefinition of `struct timespec'
  foo.c: In function `main':
  foo.c:4: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
The last warning is because you fail to return a value.

Just don't include linux/time.h. It is meant for _kernel_ use, not for
_userland_. If you really want to convert timespec to jiffies (I fail to
see why that would be useful in userland), just "#define _STRUCT_TIMESPEC"
before you include linux/time.h.
