Ok, looks like it's going to be a bit until I have time to work on the
vector allocation stuff.
In the mean time, would folks be recepteive to taking this portion of the
initial patchset:
[PATCH 1/4] msi archetecture init hook
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/21/168
This would at least give us a graceful pci_enable_msi() failure on altix
until I find the time to work on the other stuff.
