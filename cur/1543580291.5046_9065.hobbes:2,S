Hi. It worked without any problems with 2.4.0. Now with 2.4.1 I
don't get anymore the usual messages in /var/log/messages (like
pppd start and local and remote IP). The only change was the
addition of devfs, but I don't think it's causing this problem.
Any hints? I didn't change anything on my machine.
