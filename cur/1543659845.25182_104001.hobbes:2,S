It looks like not only can you synchronise with a certain accuracy,
you can determine an upper bound on that accuracy (assuming the
underlying CPU clocks are locked).
Maybe that figure could be put into /proc/cpuinfo?
As well as being an interesting value, it may be useful for programs
to know the effective accuracy of `rdtsc'.
