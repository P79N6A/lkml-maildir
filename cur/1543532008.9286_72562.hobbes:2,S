    2.3.47: Seems working
    2.3.48: Every sort of badness...
    BUT.. if I disable DMA with hdparm -d 0, the oops vanishes...
    ... still I see data corruption (my test: copying the glibc
    bzipped2 tarball around, then checking with -t)

    No. I'm running with no SMP support and no APIC support. PIIX
    support and tuning enabled. Still crashes & corrupts
    My hdparm says:
multicount = 0 (off)
I/O support = 0 (default 16-bit)
unmaskirq = 0 (off)
using_dma = 1 (on)
keepsettings = 0 (off)
nowerr = 0 (off)

This machine works perfectly(?) on < 2.3.48 without any hdparm
tuning. It has a really simple bios (Hard Disk Mode = Enhanced
IDE(Normal)|Standard IDE). In standard IDE it doesn't pass the first L
of LILO. No options on ultraDMA or other speed tunings (other than
power-management related ones).
