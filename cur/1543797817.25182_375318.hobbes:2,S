I don't remember tha name of the orginization, but the group that Linus 
setup to enforce the trademark would be perfect for this. licensing a 
'runs with linux' sticker would be exactly the type of thing the trademark 
is designed to protect.
I think it's obvious that anything with in-kernel drivers would qualify 
(new versions of hardware may need driver updates before they could use 
the sticker) and if Linus could define a suitable level of documentation 
of the hardware I think that that should very quickly lead to an in-kernel 
driver (and given hardware lead time it may be reasonable to allow the 
sticker based on the release of documentation)
I would not like to see it for external drivers, especially ones that work 
only with specific kernels from specific distros. even if the source is 
available, unless it can be merged into the kernel it's going to be a 
ongoing problem (although the open-source-but-external driver code could 
end up being deemed 'sufficiant documentation')
