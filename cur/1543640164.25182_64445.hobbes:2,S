        Of course it works in 2.4. that's the stable series! ;)
        Seriously, the floppy driver has been broken since 2.5.8, and will 
probably stay that way until someone comes along and fixes it. I believe it's 
being ported over to the new API, but I'm sure Dave or the others will get 
more into that. I last had the floppy working with 2.5.7. If you're expecting
to use the floppy driver to mount any sort of filesystem, expect either 
severe corruption, kernel freezing as you've reported, oops, or any other
thing that has or hasn't been reported, excluding normal ops. Use 2.4 for
mounting floppies.
