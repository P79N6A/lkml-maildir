Hi all,
   Sorry for the delay. We had a 3 day power failure here in Northern
California and I'm just getting back in the swing of things starting
yesterday.
   I have installed 2.6.15-rt2 and I no longer see the error
----------- [cut here ] --------- [please bite here ] ---------
Kernel BUG at include/linux/timer.h:83
invalid operand: 0000 [1] PREEMPT
CPU 0
in my dmesg file. Thanks for fixing that.
   I expect that I am probably still getting a low level of xruns. I
hope one day we can make that work a bit better. In the mean time no
problems with mplayer or MythTV so far.
Cheers,
Mark
