Subject: [PATCH -RSS 1/1] Fix reclaim failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/4/185

This patch fixes the problem seen when a container goes over its limit, the
reclaim is unsuccessful and the application is terminated. The problem
is that all pages are by default added to the active list of the RSS
controller. When __isolate_lru_page() is called, it checks to see if
the list that the page is on (active or inactive) is the same as
what PageActive(page) returns. If this is not the case, the page is skipped.
In our case a page might not have the PG_active bit set and might be on
the active list of the container, thus we were ignoring those pages and
our reclaim fails, leading to the application being killed.
