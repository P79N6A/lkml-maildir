New developments:
1.  I will have access to one of the 16GiB boxes within the next few
days.
2.  The *un-released* 2.09 BIOS upgrade from Arima seems to solve
the issue.
Given that, if you'd like to just call it good, I'd totally
understand.  I'm also fine with continuing to help debug this; it's
entirely up to you guys.
I *really* appreciate all the help, too, particularily from Alan and
Andi.  If you guys have Amazon lists or something I can throw a
thank-you at, let me know.
(Unfortunately, upgrading the BIOS clears all the settings,
including console redirection, and we have over 200 of these
machines...  Not your problem of course, just venting.)
