Thanks for the info, but yet I had to go with your patch to get it up and
running. I think the patch should be included in the official kernel
release.
Who should we send this to?

Nicke,
Glad to hear you got it working. Check out 
http://acpi.sourceforge.net
 for
acpi related information. If you can get it working with acpi=off and it
doesn't when you don't pass that flag, I'd say that there's at least
something fishy happening with acpi on your machine.
As for getting it running on 2.6 with dm, the only way I know of is to
create a custom initrd file by hand. You have to compile the lvm-dm tools
statically and create mappings first. Then in the linuxrc script, you need
run dmsetup and point it at the config files to create the devices. Until
this is handled better it's not really recommended. Good luck,
-Walt
