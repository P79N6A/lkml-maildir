Was the kernel audited for this case? I saw some rather scary uses of slab 
objects for I/O purposes come up during SLUB development.

So SLOB is then not able to compact memory after an updatedb run? The 
memory must stay dedicated to slab uses. SLOB memory can be filled 
up with objects of other slab types but it cannot be reused for page 
cache and anonymous pages etc. Slab defrag is freeing memory back to the 
page allocator with SLUB. That is *not* provided by SLOB. Could be made to 
work though.

Ok so we end up with lots of small holes on a list that has to be scanned 
to find free memory?

From mm/slob.c:
#ifndef ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
#define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN __alignof__(unsigned long)
#endif
void *__kmalloc_node(size_t size, gfp_t gfp, int node)
{
        unsigned int *m;
        int align = max(ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN, ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN);
(IMHO it would be safer to set the minimum default to __alignof__(unsigned 
long long) like SLAB/SLUB).
Ok. So lets try a worst case scenario. If we do a 128 byte kmalloc then we 
can allocate the following number of object from one 4k slab
SLUB 32	    (all memory of the 4k page is used for 128 byte objects)
SLAB 29/30  (management structure occupies first two/three objects)
SLOB 30(?)  (Alignment results in object being 136 byte of effective size,
		we have 16 bytes leftover that could be used for a
		very small allocation. Right?)
