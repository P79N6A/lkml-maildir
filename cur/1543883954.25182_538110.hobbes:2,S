Yes, clearing lsr_break_flag prior to opening the port is probably a good
thing.

Merely reading the LSR clears status bits.  We read the LSR repeatedly
so that we can monitor the transmit FIFO when outputting serial console
messages.
This means that if you have a busy serial console, and you want to send
it a sysrq request, there's a chance that the break flag in the LSR will
be cleared by the transmit FIFO status polling code thereby being lost.
So, we need to remember that status, and we do this via the lsr_break_flag.
