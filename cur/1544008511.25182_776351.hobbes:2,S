Currently we use jiffies + get_cycles(). That's going to have somewhere
between, oh, 3 bits of entropy (very stable boot with only jiffies) and
25 bits of entropy (TSC with lots of waiting for hardware) at boot. 
Ideally, we'd have access to a wall clock of some sort as well. But
that's also a fairly limited source - wall clocks are both low
resolution and predictable/collision-prone.

A simple wrapper around mix_pool_bytes probably fits the ticket.
But I don't think this will solve the general problem of 'large numbers
of practically identical machines booting up with the same pre-init
random number pools'. Beyond things like MAC addresses and serial
numbers (predictable/observable but at least not collision-prone), we
have no way to differentiate some boxes. We may need to forcibly
generate some timing entropy. Perhaps something like this:

(which is way too slow in its current form)
There's a related problem of systems with no way to store a seed across
boots.
