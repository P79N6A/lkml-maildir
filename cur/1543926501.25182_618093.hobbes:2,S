Yes. It was very useful in developing the improvements to the freelist
handling. The only reason why I don't release/run the code more often
is that my test harness work is pretty ugly (ie. it isn't just a simple
cp mm/slob.c ../blah/).
After that, just a loop of N iterations, within each iteration, there is
a chance of a single allocation of a random size, a single free of a
random outstanding allocation, a run of allocating MAX allocations, or
a run of freeing all previously allocated memory. It's a bit crude, but
it showed up your list head corruption in a second or two.
