You do from me :)  I have a NVidia on two machines that I run RT on. But
they are both SMP (well one is just hyper threaded) and I couldn't get
them working with SMP. So I just use the vesa driver when running RT on
those machines :-(  It's been several versions back since I had it
working on UP with NVidia (about a month or two back, which at Ingo's
speed is an eternity).

Well, if local_irq_disable doesn't turn off irqs and you don't have it
bugging per Esben's patch, it shouldn't be a problem to just recompile
it again.

But you don't know what those pieces that you don't see do and if they
really need irqs disabled.  I had to hack a little to get interrupts off
to call one of the NVidia's hooks. I don't really remember all that I
did, but I still wasn't able to get it working on SMP.

Hopefully, just compiling the way it is would work.  The idea of Ingo's
magic code is to have what is already in place work with RT.
