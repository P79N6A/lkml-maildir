Hello, Zwane,
I did update Documentation/RCU/* to change the uses of synchronize_kernel(),
but was relying on the documentation-extraction stuff to build the API
documentation.  So I have the following header comments in mainline:
/**
 * synchronize_rcu - wait until a grace period has elapsed.
 *
 * Control will return to the caller some time after a full grace
 * period has elapsed, in other words after all currently executing RCU
 * read-side critical sections have completed.  RCU read-side critical
 * sections are delimited by rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock(),
 * and may be nested.
 *
 * If your read-side code is not protected by rcu_read_lock(), do -not-
 * use synchronize_rcu().
 */
/**
 * synchronize_sched - block until all CPUs have exited any non-preemptive
 * kernel code sequences.
 *
 * This means that all preempt_disable code sequences, including NMI and
 * hardware-interrupt handlers, in progress on entry will have completed
 * before this primitive returns.  However, this does not guarantee that
 * softirq handlers will have completed, since in some kernels
 *
 * This primitive provides the guarantees made by the (deprecated)
 * synchronize_kernel() API.  In contrast, synchronize_rcu() only
 * guarantees that rcu_read_lock() sections will have completed.
 */
Hmmm...  Looks like some repair is needed in the synchronize_sched()
header comment -- and I vaguely remember someone pointing this out. :-/
See patch below for a fix.
Glancing through the Documentation/RCU/* stuff again, it could definitely
use some help.  Would it help if I added an example use of
synchronize_sched() that interacted with NMIs?
						Thanx, Paul
