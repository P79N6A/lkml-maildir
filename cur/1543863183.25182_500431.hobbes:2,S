I run those two in parallel:
while /bin/true; do ls -lR / > /dev/null 2>&1; done
while /bin/true; do echo 255 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; sleep 1; done
Not sure if running them in parallel is necessary, but I don't want to
change the test setup ;) Takes between 1 and 40 minutes to trigger it.
Most of the time it's around 15 minutes now, doing more random stuff in
addition to that seems to trigger it even easier (like reading mail,
rebuilding the kernel etc.).
I'm down to 2 commits after 2.6.19 now, only bad kernels, so I tend to
say that 2.6.19 with 2.6.20-rc5's sata_nv.c will also fail for me, but I
thought I might finish bisection just to be sure.

I get the same exception every time, doesn't change for me. And neither
do I get any SMART errors or something.
Thanks,
