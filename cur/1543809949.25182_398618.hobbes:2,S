Hear, hear!  Exactly what I was going to say.  Now that you want to add a 
field describing an actual device state, make it meaningful.
BTW, you might want to look here:
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2005-September/001422.html
for an example of an early implementation of just this idea.  (I still 
have the original patch file if you'd prefer to see it in plain text, 
non-html format.)
