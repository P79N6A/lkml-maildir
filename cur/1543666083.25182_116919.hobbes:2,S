Hi.
I try to setup a system using AMD ELAN-SC400.
The kernel is up and runnig fine. But I would like to use the
integrated graphics controller of the Elan SC400. I can set this up in
flat-mapped (linear mapped) framebuffer mode with 4 BPP, and I guess this is
compatible with VESA-fb (not sure). I would like to know how (and
where in the source) to initialise the screen_info code to trigger the
vesafb driver.
Can someone give a clue? or have someone already done this? will they
reveal the code for it?
in what source code file is screen_info initialised on a standard
PC-system?
