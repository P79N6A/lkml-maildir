Reading Denis Howe's  Free Online Dictionary of Computing;
http://burks.bton.ac.uk/burks/foldoc/55/51.html,
 we see that
the chief reason for no directory hard-links is that `rm`
and `rmdir` won't allow you to delete them. There is no
POSIX requirement for eliminating them, and it is possible
"Some systems provide link and unlink commands which give
direct access to the system calls of the same name, for
which no such restrictions apply."
Perhaps Linux does support hard-links to directories?
mkdir("foo", 0644)                      = 0
link("foo", "bar")                      = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
_exit(0)                                = ?
Nah... No such luck. I'll bet it's artificial. I think you
could remove that S_IFDIR check and get away with it!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
