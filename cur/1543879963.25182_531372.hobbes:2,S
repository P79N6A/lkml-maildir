Yes that's the issue. You're adding another PCI scanner copy'n'pasted
from the caller of the function you're adding it to. See the problem?

That is what early-quirks is anyways. But the way to scan for multple
things is not to add anther recursive scan, but to just extend or
change the main loop.

Andy, can you help please?  There is interest in force enabling HPET on
boards where the BIOS didn't chose too. We would need a list of PCI-IDs
where this is safe to do and what bits to poke. Thanks.
