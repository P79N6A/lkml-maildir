My feedback: it is important that during the initialization of the module,
the watchdog is being disabled. A watchdog should only start working after
it has been started via /dev/watchdog.

Please note that I added 4 days ago a patch of Marcus Junker <junker@anduras.de>
in my linux-2.6-watchdog-mm tree for the w83697hf chipset.
