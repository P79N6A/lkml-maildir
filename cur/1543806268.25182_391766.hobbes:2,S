One piece missing from this conversation is the issue that we need errors
in a uniform format.  That is why edac_mc has helper functions.
However there will always be errors that don't fit any particular model.
Could we add a edac_printk(dev, );  That is similar to dev_printk but
prints out an EDAC header and the device on which the error was found?
Letting the rest of the string be user specified.
For actual control that interface may be to blunt, but at least for people
looking in the logs it allows all of the errors to be detected and harvested.
