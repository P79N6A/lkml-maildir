Rusty,
What is the status of kksymoops?
I realize that you have a full plate, but [for the short time it existed 
in mainline] this was a incredibly useful feature for end users 
providing bug reports to me (and others).
I'm _not_ asking "when", just wondering what the plan is to resuscitate 
kksymoops.
