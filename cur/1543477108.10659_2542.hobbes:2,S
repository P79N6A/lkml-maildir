Be cautious when applying military wisdom to the civil world. The
civilized
world is often too complex for the military mind 8-)
Another theory is that fierce technical competition between gnome and
KDE
caused them to be much more advanced than either would have been without
the competition of the other.
The goal is to make them as interoperable as practically possible,
not to decide for one or the other.
