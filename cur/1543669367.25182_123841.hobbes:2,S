On bootup I get:
devfs_register(audio): could not append to parent, err: -17
devfs_register(unknown): could not append to parent, err: -17
devfs_register(unknown): could not append to parent, err: -17
ALSA ../../../alsa-kernel/core/seq/oss/seq_oss.c:223: can't register device seq
However the sound devices are there and work fine (emu10k1 and via82xx
sound cards are in the machine).
No Idea what is causing this...
Soeren.
