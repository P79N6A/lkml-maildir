There are 2 buglets in the code:
* the kernel stack size is THREAD_SIZE (ie 8192), your patch assumes
that the stack size is 4096.
* your CPU enumeration (for_all_cpus) is wrong: the cpu number
(smp_processor_id()) are set by the motherboard, and they are not
guaranteed to be contiguous:
> +#define for_all_cpus(i) for((i)=0;(i)<smp_num_cpus;(i)++)
you must use "cpu_logical_map()", eg get_irq_list() in
linux/arch/i386/kernel/irq.c does that.

I should really fix smp_call_function(): have you checked the actual
implementation:
it uses a semaphore, ie panic() waits for a semaphore before stopping
the kernel...
