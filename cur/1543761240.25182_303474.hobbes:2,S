This just feels like a sledgehammer approach, i.e., we're
programming PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE in more cases that we actually
need to.  I especially don't like that any Via device with
devfn==0 triggers the quirk.  That doesn't seem like the
right test if we're really looking for a Via bridge.

Yes, that's what I meant by the above probably not being sufficient.
The main thing the debug patch did was to move the write to after
the IOAPIC programming.  (And I think it added back the mysterious
udelay().)  My point is that the write could just as easily be done
in a pci_enable fixup, because that also happens after the IOAPIC
update.
The quirk would have to be something like this:
	static void __devinit quirk_via_irq(struct pci_dev *dev)
	{
		if  (!via_interrupt_line_quirk)
			return;
		/* update PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE */
		...
	}
	DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, quirk_via_irq);
with a PCI_FIXUP_HEADER quirk that sets via_interrupt_line_quirk when
we find a Via bridge.
But I'm uneasy even about this -- what if there are multiple bridges,
with only one of them being a Via?  Why would we want to apply this
quirk to the devices under the non-Via bridges?  Wouldn't it be better
to search up the hierarchy of each device, looking for a Via bridge,
and apply the quirk only if we find one?
