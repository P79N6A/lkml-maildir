I am working with an external raid array (looks to the system like a
single drive) and am stuck using the 2.0.36 kernel as informix will not
function with the 2.2 kernels. The raid is 52G and I need to split it into
2G partitions for use with informix. The stock setup (on both redhat and
slackware) only allows for 15 partitions on a SCSI device. If I were using
the 2.2 series I would try devfs, but what options do I have for the 2.0
series?
