About problems of pathname-based access control and countermeasures:
TOMOYO Linux has many countermeasures that prevents many of pathname-based access control's problems.
In short, in TOMOYO Linux, attackers can't create link freely, can't rename freely,
can't manipulate namespace freely.
Not all problems can be solved (some of causes are current LSM specification),
but is enough for SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)/personal systems.

About policy file handling:
Common implementations treat policy file on the filesystem as the up-to-date data,
and the kernel keeps a copy of policy file in kernel's memory.
But TOMOYO's implementation is opposite.
TOMOYO Linux has "learning mode" feature that helps administrator develop ACL (access control list).
Since the "learning mode" automatically appends entries to in-memory datastructure,
TOMOYO Linux implements in-memory datastructure using a singly-linked list
using a kind of DBMS (DataBase Management System).
TOMOYO Linux regards the ACL in kernel's DBMS as the up-to-date data
and the ACL in the policy file as a backup.
TOMOYO Linux's policy file consists of instructions for reproducing a snapshot of
ACL entries in kernel's DBMS which was saved in the past.
This is the reason why TOMOYO Linux doesn't use binary (offset-from-start-of-policy) format
for policy file, and in-kernel policy parser exists.

About network hook expansion:
TOMOYO Linux makes use of userspace intervention to allow/reject connections and/or packets
based on the application's domain.
Current network-related LSM hooks can't know the final recipient of connections and/or packets.
This is the reason why TOMOYO Linux wants to add post-accept() and post-recvmsg() hooks.
