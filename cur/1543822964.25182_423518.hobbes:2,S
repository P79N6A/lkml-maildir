I can't really assert that; it doesn't _seem_ to be bothered the same way,
but I've only run it for an hour or so to compile the other kernels.
Just to be 100% sure it's not overheating or such, I've turned off all fan
control in the BIOS. But then again, overheating sounds really far off; the
machine is in a cooled server room (20 degrees Celsius), and has lots of fans
making sure the air flow is good.

OK.

Hm, yes, for some reason CONFIG_NUMA, CONFIG_K8_NUMA and
CONFIG_x86_64_ACPI_NUMA are all set; I guess they're left from the stock
config I use at a base. (For those tuning in; this is a dual-core amd64. That
might be relevant somehow.)
