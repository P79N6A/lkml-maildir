(Suitable cc's added - this was why your patch got lost)
The patch seems reasonable but the changelog seems to be quite
misleading.  I did this:
   The ssc pointer is not valid when the id is not found in the
   list.  Convert the message from a debug one into an error message
   and avoid dereferencing the bad pointer.
OK?
