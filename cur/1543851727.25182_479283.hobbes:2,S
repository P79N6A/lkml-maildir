Use a struct device instead of a struct class_device please.  That will
change your tree a bit here (you will have symlinks at the top level.
Have you been working with the X developers that have been doing a lot
of work in describing and interacting with these different video
devices?  I think you might want to work with them so that you don't
create an interface that will not be used by them.
thanks,
