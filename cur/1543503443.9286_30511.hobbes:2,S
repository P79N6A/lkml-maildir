I've been bitten by this before.  The linux kernel source is at
fault, classic example is in include/asm-i386/spinlock.h
#if (__GNUC__ > 2) || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 8)
  typedef struct { } rwlock_t;
  #define RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED (rwlock_t) { }
#else
  typedef struct { int gcc_is_buggy; } rwlock_t;
  #define RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED (rwlock_t) { 0 }
#endif
Any structure incorporating these lock types will thus be differing sizes
depending on your version of gcc.  grep the source carefully for "GNUC"
