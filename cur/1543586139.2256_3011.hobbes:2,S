Subject: 2.4.2 Patch for missing "proc_get_inode" symbol in comx driver

Folks,
Sorry if this has been addressed before, but I didn't see this in the
release notes for the latest ac drivers.
I tried to build the comx driver in the 2.4.2 kernel, but got unresolved
external "proc_get_inode" when I attempted to load the module.  Looks
like all that is missing is an EXPORT_SYMBOL entry in procfs_syms.c
Is there some reason why this function is not being exported or is it
just an error?
Here's the patch if anyone is interested.
