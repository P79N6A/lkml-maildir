Subject: [patch] CFS scheduler, -v13

i'm pleased to announce release -v13 of the CFS scheduler patchset.
The CFS patch against v2.6.22-rc1, v2.6.21.1 or v2.6.20.10 can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
     
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/
-v13 is a fixes-only release. It fixes a smaller accounting bug, so if 
you saw small lags during desktop use under certain workloads then 
please re-check that workload under -v13 too. It also tweaks SMP 
load-balancing a bit. (Note: the load-balancing artifact reported by 
Peter Williams is not a CFS-specific problem and he reproduced it in 
v2.6.21 too. Nevertheless -v13 should be less prone to such artifacts.)
I know about no open CFS regression at the moment, so please re-test 
-v13 and if you still see any problem please re-report it. Thanks!
Changes since -v12:
 - small tweak: made the "fork flow" of reniced tasks zero-sum
 - debugging update: /proc/<PID>/sched is now seqfile based and echoing
   0 to it clears the maximum-tracking counters.
 - more debugging counters
 - small rounding fix to make the statistical average of rounding errors
   zero
 - scale both the runtime limit and the granularity on SMP too, and make
   it dependent on HZ
 - misc cleanups
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome,
	Ingo
