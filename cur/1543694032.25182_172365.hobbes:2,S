I've been using extents since the patch was introduced.  I haven't seen 
any corruption when using it with large files (ie. multimedia only).  In 
short, has there been any progress with getting fsck support? I'm 100% 
in support of this patch going into mainline kernel as a non-default 
option.  It's perfect for partitions that deal with large files, but 
still want ext3's fs corruption protection.  I average 10700 blocks an 
extent and see an extreme increase in performance over non-extents ext3 
doing operations on files of the same size.   I guess it's about time to 
update.
