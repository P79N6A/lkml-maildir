Hi all
A tiny SCHED_FIFO microoptimisation and comments changes make up the 
staircase7.9 patch. I doubt anyone will notice any difference, but this 
shows the relative stability/maturity of the scheduler now. Patches for 
vanilla, 2.6.7-bk20 and 2.6.7-mm6 are available. The sched batch (idle 
scheduling) and sched iso (soft real time scheduling) policies are also 
available, stable and ready for prime time testing.
The sched batch and sched iso policies have been updated slightly. The 
sched batch implementation should be safe for disk intensive loads while 
still minimising it's cpu usage as much as possible.
I've resynced with 2.6.7-bk20 as the bk19 introduced the security fixes 
so if you feel you need the security updates you should move to this 
snapshot.
There was a small cfq bug Jens has just addressed and I've added the 
incremental fix to that in the ck-dev, mm6 and bk20 snapshots. If you 
use cfq (ck does by default) it is probably worth applying this fix.
