I'm using vendor driver because mainline (r8169) didn't work for my
rtl8111B chipset. The r8169 driver recognized both NICs but it was
constantly giving failures at recognizing link (sometimes worked, sometimes
not) and NIC leds weren't working ok also (clear signal of something wasn't
working properly...). When I banned r8169 module and installed/loaded
vendor driver (r8168), NICs problems disappeared. That's why I was using
vendor driver. I didn't note estability problems by then; they only
appeared when running in production environment (Murphy's law!) :-(
Another curiosity: I've discovered than *another* machine I'm administering
(different customer, different hardware, different isp... but same Debian
version and same kernel: 2.6.18-6-686-bigmem) is using r8169 module without
problems at all. And guess it, it has the same NIC hardware (!!!):
02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B
PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 01)
The working machine is an AMD dual core with 2 MB RAM and 1 rtl8111B NIC
(being the non-working an Intel Quad core with 4 MB RAM and 2 rtl8111B
NICs). So yes, as you said, the problems could be due to Quad / 4GB RAM.
There's no Debian-official 2.6.27 deb packages (latest is 2.6.26),
according to:
http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/linux-2.6.html
Best for etch I've found is a 2.6.26 deb package (backport).
I suppose you're refering to the ultra-experimental "trunk" branch at:
deb 
http://kernel-archive.buildserver.net/debian-kernel
 trunk main
Right?
I'll give it a try, it seems a good choice (given the circunstances).
Another option: Do you think it worth the pain to compile a custom 2.6.28
kernel? (in other words, do you think it contains fixes that could solve
the strange issues I've been affected with? I don't follow kernel
development so I cannot answer this question but perhaps you could...).
Thank you very much for your comments. They are greatly appreciated.
