1. It depends on the ratio of added code and its usefulness. I must assume 
the first patch didn't even make it to the kernel due to its size, so I 
think it's not unreasonable to explore the alternatives.
2. There are many ways to load an unauthorized module, thus you have to 
prevent any modification of the kernel not just in memory but also on 
disk.
bye, Roman
