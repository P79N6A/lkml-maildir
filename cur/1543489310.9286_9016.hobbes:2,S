What planet are you on?!? Have you the faintest clue how long
it takes the big vendors (like Informix and Oracle) to gear
up to port, QA and support a new platform? And then you have
to wait for the next tier of application software to be ported,
hoping that (a) the company still exists, (b) they care about
porting the code you want, (c) they aren't going to stiff you
for a load more money in the process.
  Running, and *depending on* truely ancient programs is not
that uncommon!
