Hello Jaroslav.
I'll do some testing during the upcoming weekend to confirm, that the 
mentioned problems still exist with the current ALSA release. Last time I 
checked was sometime around Linux 2.6.10. I'll file a bug report of my 
findings to the ALSA bug tracking system and contact the author of the 
driver. Initially I had not spent much time on those problems, because I 
had an alternative working OSS driver, but since removal of the OSS seems 
to get closer, it's probably time to fix these issues now.
Regards
Thorsten
