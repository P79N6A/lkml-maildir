Who removed it from the 2.4.x driver recently, and why?
I've been playing around, accidently corrupting my firmware
a few times, and had to grab the firmware back from older
trees to make my qlogic,FC card usable again.
Removing the firmware makes no sense, if the firmware was
incorrect for some reason, simply correct it.
Later,
