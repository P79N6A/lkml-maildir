	Few facts :
	1) You can't get away without refcounting the module users,
	   unless you implement weak pointers in the kernel
	2) You can do refcounting in the module itself (old way, 2.2, 2.4)
	3) You can do refcounting in the module users (new way)
	4) The module code itself can't do the refcounting, unless it puts
	   itself explicitely between the module and its users and
	   understand the usage semantic of the module APIs

	Well, there is still some time before 2.6.X, but not that
much. We understand what the issues are, we now some of the solutions,
now we just need a schedule and implement those. I personally don't
care too much of the details as long s there is a solution.
	When are we supposed to get a preview of the "right" way to do
it ?

	IrDA sockets will be unloadable, because IrDA wants to be
modular, and people need to unload it to do CIR. So, for me the issue
is more the probability of crashing the system.
