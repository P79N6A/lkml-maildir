   Please don't do this. I'm regularly having to fix drivers where people
   hid bugs this way rather than working out if it was a real problem. If
   it is genuinely a compiler corner case then let the gcc folks know and
   comment it but leave the warning.
A compiler isn't able to work out the control flow which
makes sure ret is indeed initialized on every path to
a use.  Solving such a problem is traveling salesman'ish :-)
	for (;;) {
		...
		if (skb)
			break;
		...
		set 'ret' to something
		more break statements
	}
	if (skb == 0)
		goto out; /* where 'ret' is used' */
	set 'ret' to something
See? :-)
