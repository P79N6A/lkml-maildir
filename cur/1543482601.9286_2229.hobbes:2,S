Well, here are some results from my 166 Mhz Pentium MMX Toshiba laptop with 
a Crystal 4232 card.
  5:          1          XT-PIC  Crystal audio controller
Starting esd (esound-0.2.7-1), and waiting for 60 secs:
  5:      32096          XT-PIC  Crystal audio controller
Which looks like 530 interrupts/s
I also have a 200 Mhz Pentium MMX with a soundblaster card that gives 590
interrupts/s when running esd. Can it be sampling something at a very high
speed? I was however not playing (or recording) anything while these test
were done. The system feels about 4 times faster when I kill esd.
