That isn't very polite, is it.

Sorry to contradict you. The head hackers on linux-kernel are behaving more
or less the same, modulo more work (linux is not a small club of developers
anymore, and l-k gets more than it's fair share of clueless posts; I'd

start badmouthing everybody in sight when things don't go exactly as they
wish.
