The vfs consistency semantics are a little complex and fragile at the
moment, which is the only thing that makes it hard.  Think about how
many months of truncate bugs we had, then consider how the situation
looks when all the bits of filesystem are moving around while its being
accessed.  That's not to say it won't happen, but it's unlikely to ever
be solid until the vfs semantics mature a little more.
