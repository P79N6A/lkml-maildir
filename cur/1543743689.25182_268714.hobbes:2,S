... yes ...
I think we should *never* attempt PPR on a SE bus, even when the drive
supports it.  We've seen bugs in Seagate drive firmware because of this,
so let's stop doing it.
How does this patch (whitespace damaged, apply by hand) make people feel?

Thanks, those are interesting.  It's good to see that we really are
spitting PPR out onto the wire when we shouldn't be.

I think disabling PPR on an SE bus should be a better fix than that.

My primary development for this driver lives in the parisc-linux CVS.
I publish patches on an irregular basis.  If this patch fixes a
significant number of problems (and it seems it might), I'll do a
2.1.18n release.
