It is exec-fix-remove_arg_zero.patch in Andrew's tree, it's exploitable
in that it leaks memory, but it could also release corrupted pagetables
into quicklists on those architectures that have them...
Anyway, it quite likely would have gone unfixed for several more years
if we didn't have the bug triggers in. Now you could argue that my
patch obviously fixes all bugs in there (but I wouldn't :)), and being
most complex of the few callsites, _now_ we can avoid the bug checks.
However I'd prefer to keep them at least under CONFIG_DEBUG_VM.

Yeah, this one, thanks. I'm just interested.

I would like to see that too, but when you are ready :)
Thanks,
