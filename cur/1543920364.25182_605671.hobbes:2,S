FYI, looks good so far, ontop of Linus' latest -git tree.
btw., one thing i always found weird about forcedeth is that it 
generates an extra ~100 irqs per second even when there's no network 
traffic:
 11:      89752    XT-PIC-XT        eth0
 11:      89854    XT-PIC-XT        eth0
 11:      89955    XT-PIC-XT        eth0
 11:      90056    XT-PIC-XT        eth0
 11:      90157    XT-PIC-XT        eth0
(irq count snapshot every second). Just in case it's easy to fix ...
