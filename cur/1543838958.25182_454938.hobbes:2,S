I agree that kernel objects cann't be reclaimed easily.  But what you
are proposing is also not right.  Returning failure w/o doing any
reclaim on pages (that are reclaimable) is not useful.  And this is why
I asked, is this change going to be part of next set of patches (as
current set of patches are only tracking kernel usage).
