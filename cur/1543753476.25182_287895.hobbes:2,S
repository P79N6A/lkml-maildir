One problem is that on SMPs "average" doesn't really
make sense.  Statistically, "average" (mean()) only
really makes sense when you have a Gaussian distribution
of results.  The benchmark results for SMPs tend to
be stongly modal, i.e. very tight clusters around
a few values.  In this environment "average" is
generally meaningless.
That being said, the '-P' flag exists on most lmbench
version 3 benchmarks and allows one to have a given
number of jobs running in parallel.  It is intended
to measure performance under load.  However, even
in this case one may see modal results.  Please see
the recent lmbench paper [2] for an example.
Cheers,
Carl

bw_pipe (along with most/all of the lmbench tools already has a "-P"
argument to specify the degree of parallelism).
