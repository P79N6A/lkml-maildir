And you don't see a problem with this?  You are hardcoding variables of
a certain size and layout.  This is against every good design principal.
There are other problems like not using a protected namespace.

This, too, is not adequate.  It requires working on the 1-on-1 model.
Using user-level contexts (setcontext etc) is made very hard and
expensive.  There is not one state to change.  Using any of the code (or
functionality using the state) in signal handlers, possibly recursive,
will throw things in disorder.
There is no reason to not make the state explicit.

That's the point.  We cannot start using an inadequate API now since one
will _never_ be able to get rid of it again.  We have accumulated
several examples of this in the past years.
The API design should be general enough to work for all the
architectures which are currently envisioned and must be extensible to
be extendable for future architectures.  Your API does not allow to
write adequate code even on some/many of today's architectures.

I am proposing no graph-based descriptions.  And this is something where
you miss the point.  This is only the lowest level interface.  It
prorvides enough functionality to describe the machine architecture.  If
some fancy alternative representations are needed this is something for
a higher-level interface.
What must be avoided at all costs is programs peeking into /sys and
/proc to determine the topology.  First of all, this makes programs
architecture and even machine-specific.  Second, the /sys and /proc
format will change over time.  All these access must be hidden and the
NUMA library is just the place for that.
Saying

just means we will get programs today which hardcode today's existing
and most probably inadequate representation of the topology in /sys and
/proc.

These are two sides of the same coin.  Today we already have problems
with programs running on machines with SMT processors.  How can those
use pthread_setaffinity() to create theoptimal number of threads and
place them accordingly?  It requires magic /proc parsing for each and
every architecture.  The problem is exactly the same as with NUMA and
the interface extensions to cover MC/SMT as well are minimal.

The NUMA library interface should not be cluttered because of
considerations of legacy apps which need to be converted.  These are
separate issues, the design of the API must not be influenced by this.
The problem always has been that in such cases the correct interfaces
are not being used but instead the "easier to use" legacy interfaces are
used.

That is inadequate.  Any process/thread state like this increases the
program cost since it means that the program at all times must remember
the current state and switch if necessary.  Combine this with 3rd party
libraries using the functionality as well and you'll get explicit
switching before *every* memory allocation because one cannot assume
anything about the state.  Even if the NUMA library keeps track of the
state internally, there is always the possibility that more than one
instance of the library is used at any one time (e.g., statically linked
into a DSO).
I repeast myself: global or thread-local states are bad.  Always have
been, always will be.
