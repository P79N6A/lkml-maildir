At the risk of sounding REALLY ridiculous...
I asked yesterday how to install my USB Zip 100, and someone very thoughtfully
replied with the information I needed.  In an attempt to print that out, I
destroyed my entire home directory, including all my mail.  This has made for a
horrible day of reconfiguring and general hell.  If the person who responded to
me could be so kind as to resend that mail, I'd really, really appriciate it. 
I'll try not to nuke anything this time, I swear.
Thanks!
