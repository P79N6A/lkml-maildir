I don't understand what this (ugly) patch has to do with the overall
bugfix.  We're fixing the APCI initialisation - what does that have to do
with presenting cpu-hotplug files in sysfs?

via:
#else
#define cpu_hotplug_no_control 1
here.
But does this variable _have_ to be a negative like this?  The code would
be simpler if it had the opposite sense and was called, say,
cpu_hotplug_enable_control_file.
Are these patches considered 2.6.19 material?  They look a bit big, ugly
and scary for that.
