Hi Andi,
As you suggested, removing ehci_hcd (using rmmod ehci_hcd) allows the USB 
storage device to work.  So, to answer your question, yes, the ohci_hcd 
driver does work with 3GB's of RAM.  Still, knoppix 3.9 IS able to work with 
both ehci and 3GB's of RAM, so it still sounds like it's a software problem, 
not an nvidia hardware issue.
