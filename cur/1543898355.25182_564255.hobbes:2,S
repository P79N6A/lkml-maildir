The problem is that most distributions use USB as module (in initrd,
or later). If you're able to load modules, you're also able to run a
userspace programs that blinks. That's the way I implemented it in
SUSE now. In my tests it takes about < 5 seconds from the sysrq-c to
the time the first blink. That's ok IMO.
And if a person compiles his kernel manually, he doesn't need keyboard
LED blinking for kdump because he can look at the HDD LED to see what
happens (or serial console). ... :)
I don't know if it's worth to apply a patch that uses the keyboard
interface in the kernel, because there are several small changes
necessary (see patch, that's what my thought was).
Thanks,
   Bernhard
