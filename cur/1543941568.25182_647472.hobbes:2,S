This is a bug - we should notice the config changed.

And this is a feature not a bug.
I am well aware that this is a change in behaviour but
if you looks at top left corner you can see the current filename
and is thus told what menuconfig use as default filename.

I fixed the bug like this:

Subject: [PATCH] kconfig: mark config as changed when loading an alternate config
Michal Zachar <mgzachar@mail.t-com.sk> reported that
menuconfig did not save the new config when loading
an alternate config unless he altered it manually.
Mark config as changed upon load of alternate config fixed this.
