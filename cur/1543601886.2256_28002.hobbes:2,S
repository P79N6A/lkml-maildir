In Solaris, before spinning on a busy spin-lock, thread checks whether
spin-lock holder runs on the same processor. If so, thread goes to sleep
and holder wakes it up on spin-lock release. The same, I guess is going
for interrupts that are served as separate threads. This way, one can
re-schedule with spin-locks held.
