 That would help, but it can't easily be implemented when you are
 targeting consumer devices like nas, routers et al which already
 have been widely deployed.
 I know that the solution would be to fix the bootloader, but
 Joe Average is a little bit scared of reflashing it.
 A maclist-alike system could help to solve that situation.
