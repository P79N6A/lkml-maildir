Manfred,
This is what's being reported when I produce the oops.  I think we have 
memory corruption somewhere, which explains the funky code offsets.  It's
easy to reproduce.  Call filp_open with the handle table I gave you 
on a single IDE system with **NO** tape drive in the system, and it 
crashes quite after the module is loaded the fisrt time, then unloaded,
and reloaded a second time.  The oops happens on the second insmod 
of the module.  I can provide you the actual module itself built with
all the code if you want to reproduce it. 
It's 100% reproduceable.
