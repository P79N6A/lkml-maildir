Subject: [PATCH] Busy inodes after unmount, be more verbose in generic_shutdown_super
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I get 'Busy inodes after umount' very often, even with recent kernels.
Usually it remains unnoticed for a while. A bit more info about what
superblock had problems would be helpful.
bdevname() doesnt seem to be the best way for pretty-printing NFS mounts
for example. Should it just print the major:minor pair? 
Are there scripts or something that parse such kernel messages, should
the extra info go somewhere else?
