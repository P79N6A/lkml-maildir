I was surprised if configfs was merged with zero users in the kernel.
But I get your point, what about the patch below?

Make it clear that users usually shouldn't manually enable CONFIGFS_FS.

-	  configfs is a ram-based filesystem that provides the converse
-	  of sysfs's functionality. Where sysfs is a filesystem-based
-	  view of kernel objects, configfs is a filesystem-based manager
-	  of kernel objects, or config_items.
+	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
+	  modules require configfs, but a module built outside the kernel
+	  tree does. Such modules require Y or M here.
 
-	  Both sysfs and configfs can and should exist together on the
-	  same system. One is not a replacement for the other.
+	  If unsure, say N.
