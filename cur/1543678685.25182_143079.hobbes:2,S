Hi,
I tried suspend on ram on my VAio FX 801 & kernel 2.5.69,
with echo "3" > /proc/acpi/sleep
That works great, system goes to sleep and red light blinking.
But When i try to resume, i can see the display coming back for a few 
milliseconds, and then LCD goes black & backlight turns off.
I'm sure the kernel is correctly restored because i run commands like 
locate -u or reboot in "blind mode", so my problem is the video mode 
restoring.
if i try acpi_sleep=s3_bios, i get blacklight on & LCD all white.
Do you have ideas on what can cause this strange behaviour. any comments 
welcome
NB: my vaio pass blacklist test at boot up
thanks.
Olivier Fauchon
