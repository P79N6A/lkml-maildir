Subject: parport_pc - "possible IRQ conflict" message

Can anyone explain to me why I get the message "possible IRQ conflict!"
whenever the parport_pc module is loaded (any 2.4.0-test* kernel)? 
Everything seems to be working OK, but I'd like to understand what it's
actually complaining about.
The motherboard is a SuperMicro PIII-DME, with the parallel port set to
ECP, IRQ 7, DMA 3.  Module options are "io=0x378 irq=7".
Thanx!
