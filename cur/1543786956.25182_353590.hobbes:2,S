I put together a different patch, but I want to get your input on the
approach before I post it.  It requires both user-space and kernel-space
changes.
Basically, you identify that a given automount tree is a direct map tree.
This information is passed along to the kernel (I did this via a mount
option), and recorded (in the super block info).  Then, when a directory
lookup occurs, if we are in a direct map tree, and ghosting is enabled,
then we pass the lookup on to the real lookup code.
I'm not sold on the approach, as I haven't thought through all of the
implications.  Care to comment?
