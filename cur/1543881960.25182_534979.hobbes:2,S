And by "hibernation", you mean what? You mean "snapshot + shutdown", 
right?
Think about it for five seconds, and then ask yourself: at which point in 
the "snapshot + shutdown" sequence would you actually tell a disk to shut 
down?
If you said "snapshot", then you'd be *wrong*. 
That's my _point_. The snapshot() function should not (and MUST NOT) tell 
disks to shut down, because unlike suspend(), we're still going to _use_ 
those disks afterwards (why? To write out the snapshot image!).
In other words, the act of creating a snapshot has *nothing* to do with 
suspend.
Now, after you've created (and written out) the snapshot, what do you 
actually end up doing?
That's right - you end up _shutting down_ the machine, and yes, as part 
of the _shutdown_ sequence you may actually end up doing a lot of the 
things that a suspend would do. But that's long *after* you've actually 
done the "snapshot" part, and has absolutely nothing to do with it.
That's where I started: whole "suspend to disk" thing actually has _more_ 
to do with "shutdown" than with "suspend".
