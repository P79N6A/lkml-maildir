Well yes, if the syscall is correctly implemented in the library,
there's no problem.

#ifdef may be hard pressed to identify a specific kernel with a
specific patch. Kernel headers are obviously a solution (although
this violates the "user space must never include kernel headers"
pseudo-rule), but add the problem of needing to identify the
"current" source tree, which is a configuration step almost always
requiring manual intervention.
My suggestion for /proc/syscalls isn't entirely serious, but it 
would be nice if we could eventually solve this problem ...
