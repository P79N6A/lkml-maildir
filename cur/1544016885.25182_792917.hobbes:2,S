The application that is interrupted has no control over when SLQB runs its
expiration. The longer the queues the longer the holdoff. Look at the
changelogs for various queue expiration things in the kernel. I fixed up a
couple of those over the years for latency reasons.

Well yes with enterprise app you are likely not going to see it. Run HPC
and other low latency tests (Infiniband based and such).

Memory allocations in latency critical appls are generally done in
contexts where high latencies are tolerable (f.e. at startup).

It still will have to move objects between queues? Or does it adapt the
slub method of "queue" per page?

Well I wrote the code in SLAB that does this. And AFAICT this was a very
bad hack that I had to put in after all the original developers of the
NUMA slab stuff vanished and things began to segfault.
SLUB obeys memory policies. It just uses the page allocator for this by
doing an allocation *without* specifying the node that memory has to come
from. SLAB manages memory strictly per node. So it always has to ask for
memory from a particular node. Hence the need to implement memory policies
in the allocator.

Periodic movement again introduces processing spikes and pollution of the
cpu caches.

The need for that fallback comes from the SLAB methodology used....

Queuing and the explosions of the number of queues with the alien caches
resulted in the potential of portions of memory vanishing into these
queues. Queueing means unused objects are in those queues stemming from
pages that would otherwise (if the the free object would be "moved" back
to the page) be available for other kernel uses.

I still dont see the problem that SLQB is addressing (aside from code
cleanup of SLAB). Seems that you feel that the queueing behavior of SLAB
is okay.
