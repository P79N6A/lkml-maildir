Thats okay, nobody really knows yet. I believe that SUSPEND and HALT
are very similar, and flags best way to separate them. I believe that
FREEZE and REBOOT are very similar, too, and again would use flags to
tell between them.

First I want type checking for pm_message_t. That's 2.6.12-early
material. Then, when it is *really clear* that flags are needed, I'll
add them. "really needed" as in "we have a driver where it matters".
