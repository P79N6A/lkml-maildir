When an out of tree user is requesting a change for which it will likely be 
the only user (such that it can make it in tree), caution is warranted.  But 
it does create a bit of a chicken and egg conundrum for the proposer.  
At least this is the way it's always seemed to me (re: the requested VFS/LSM
changes). Anyways, it's not an issue and there isn't a lot of point dwelling
over past LSM history. I 100% agree with Serge, discussion first about the 
approach is definately the way to go.
