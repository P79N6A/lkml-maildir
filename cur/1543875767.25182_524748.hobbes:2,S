As long as the new behavior continues to call
driver->close() if driver->open() succeeds
then I see no problem.
If individual drivers are correctly doing internal
reference counting to handle driver->close() calls
without a preceding successful driver->open() call
(usually just doing nothing), then they should
continue to operate correctly without the extra
and unnecessary driver->close().
