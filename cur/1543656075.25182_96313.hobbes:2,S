A socket family?  Most userspace crypto apps, IMO, will deal with 
networking somewhere.

Yes please!  A HiFn 6500 can do a 2048-bit DH exchange in about 30ms, 
compared with several seconds for a P3-900.  It's similarly fast for 
everything else, and utterly astonishing for RSA (under a millisecond for a 
signature!).

I may have some leverage here.  We'll see.

But OpenBSD has drivers, and they say that Broadcom were very good to deal 
with.  I suggest writing the OpenBSD driver maintainer and asking who to 
contact.
