You can pivot_root after the bios hands control over to the kernel, sure.  
But if the bios can actually boot from arbitrary blocks on the CD before the 
kernel takes over, this is news to me.  And for the kernel to read from the 
CD, it needs its drivers already loaded for it, so they have to be in that 
2.88 megs somewhere.  (Statically linked, ramdisk, etc.)
I was just pointing out that small boot environments weren't going away any 
time soon, even if floppy drivers were to finally manage it.  When you 
install your system, the initial image you bootstrap from is generally tiny.
Now I'm not so familiar with that etherboot stuff, intel's whatsis 
specification (PXE?) for sucking a bootable image through the network.  All 
I've ever seen that boot is a floppy image, but I don't know if that's a 
limitation in the spec or just the way people are using it...
And of course you could always do some variant of two kernel monte...
