I forget to mention. in the same hardware configuration (same slot, sharing
IRQ with other card) my card works perfect if I was using uni-processor
without APIC support kernel (i tried 2.4.5-ac6 with apic disabled
uniprocessor on a dual p3 box). If the driver did something wrong, it
should not work on that system either. Maybe what I thought was wrong.
