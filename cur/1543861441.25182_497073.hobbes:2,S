It is fragile for this code to depend on link order; Adrian's obvious and
trivial cleanups broke it.  Not only that, but some FC kernels had/have the
link order reversed such that this quirk is broken anyway.
I sent a patch for this back in May:
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2006-May/016113.html
There was some discussion on the linux-pci mailing list as well; can't seem to
find an archive of that though.  Basically, it was not understood how the FC
kernels could have a reversed link order.  I never followed up on it, my bad.
At any rate, can we please get the patch above applied?  I will send a new one
if necessary.
