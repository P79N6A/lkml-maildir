Dear all!
I am posting this request, hoping for a reply from someone that has experienced similar problems.
My application uses the possibility to change scheduling mechanism. When changing from 
SCHED_OTHER to SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, my application causes the whole Linux
PC to "hang". Prior to launching my own application, I launch a "superbash" application with
higher priority than my own application. But I am not able to switch to the window where this
"superbash" application is running to kill my own application. The PC simply does not respond
to any input from the keyboard.
I have used this mechanism before, and I am quite confident that this worked under kernel 2.4.2.
Are you aware of anything that could explain this behaviour?
Thanks.
