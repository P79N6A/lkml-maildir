Hello listeners,
	I want to find the virtual address of the start of the code/data
segment and the their size of a child process. ie Father must be able to know
these info about the child.
I have tried ptrace (PTRACE_PEEKUSER,...) but beyond offset 64 (marks the end
of the register structure), everything is returned as 0.  
POinters would be welcome.
I am not subscribed so please send me a cc.
Regards
Shourya
