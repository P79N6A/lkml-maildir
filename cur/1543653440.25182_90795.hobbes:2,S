FYI, This seems to work fine on my Compaq Evo N1015v too.
This monster seems to have the same chipset as you mentioned.
(unknown ATI gfx card id: 1002:4336, with ALI bridge)
Every other 2.4 kernel goes mental with machine checks,
and assorted IDE errors. had to use a 2.2 Debian install
to get things off the ground. Strange how 2.2 IDE worked much
better than 2.4's here.
