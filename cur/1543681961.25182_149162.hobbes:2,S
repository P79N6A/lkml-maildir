Dear all:
I have 2.5.75 at home and it works great. Now Im trying to run it at work.
After booting it for the first time, I got this message:
VFS: cannot open root device "302" or unknown block (3,2)
(my root partition is /dev/hda2, ext3, worked great with debian's 2.4.20-386)
So, I thougt that I could debug it with an initrd and build one with
mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd-2.5.75 /lib/modules/2.5.75
I configured lilo to use that initrd
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.5.75
and booted again.
Now I got:
couldn't find valid RAM disk image starting at 0
The initrd image I built looks like a valid "Compressed ROMFS" (this is
cramfs, right?) as I can mount it via loop device.
What am I doing wrong?
Im not specially intrested in using the initrd, I just wanted to boot on
/dev/hda2 :).
I would love if somebody could point me how to fix the root device or the
initrd thing .
Im attaching my .config
thanks in advance
