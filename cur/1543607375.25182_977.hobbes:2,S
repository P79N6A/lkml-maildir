I have a very similar OOPS that I reported to linux-kernel just last
week: see full details at

I also have a totally reproduceable OOPS on 2.4.9 through 2.4.12. 
Kernel 2.4.7 works just fine.  If the soundcard is compiled in to the
kernel, it dies while booting.  If it is compiled as a module, it dies
when attempting to load the module (typically when artsd starts).

My machine is an ECS K7AMA: ALi 1645 northbridge, ALi Magic 1535D+
southbridge.  Sound is onboard the southbridge.  I ran ksymoops on my
OOPS report, so you can see the trace at the message archive.
