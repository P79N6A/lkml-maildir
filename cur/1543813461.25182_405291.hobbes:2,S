After checking proposed yours, Eric and vserver solutions, I must say 
that these all are hacks.
If we want to virtualize sysctl we need to do it in honest way:
multiple sysctl trees, which can be different in different namespaces.
For example, one namespace can see /proc/sys/net/route and the other one 
not. Introducing helpers/handlers etc. doesn't fully solve the problem 
of visibility of different parts of sysctl tree and it's access rights.
Another example, the same network device can present in 2 namespaces and 
these are dynamically(!) created entries in sysctl.
So we need to address actually 2 issues:
- ability to limit parts of sysctl tree visibility to namespace
- ability to limit/change sysctl access rights in namespace
You can check OpenVZ for cloning sysctl tree code. It is not clean, nor 
elegant, but can be cleanuped.
Thanks,
Kirill
