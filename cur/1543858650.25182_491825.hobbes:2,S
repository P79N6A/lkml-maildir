It's about freedom, not price.  And even then, it's the license that
has not cost, not the copyright.

Sure, but we're not necessarily talking about code that is two years
old.  We're talking about future releases.  Then, if someone
interfaces with code that was already there before, they might claim
they're still entitled to do so.  But if it's new code they interface
with, or new code they wrote after this clarification is published,
would they still be entitled to estoppel?  FWIW, IANAL.
