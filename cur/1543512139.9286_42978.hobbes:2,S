I think it's wrong to fix synchonization on a problem-by-problem basis:
VFS synchonization for read()/write()/truncate()/file lock's is broken,
and I would try to find one solution instead of patch-work.

These are 2 pending problems which must be fixed before 2.4
If you fix them, then you will add synchonization to sys_write(), and
raw-io will be affected since raw-io is accessed through sys_write() to
a special character device driver.
Other pending problems are O_APPEND, mandantory file locks.
Eg mandantory file locks:
process A: backup. It make multi-megabyte read operations. During these
long operations, the kernel schedules around.
process B: uses the database. Mandantory file locks.
it calls lock(), read(), write(), write(), unlock().
                                ^^^
		kernel schedules back to process A, it reads the data.
--> data corruption. Mandantory file locks must not return if there are
pending read operations in the affected area.

Not yet, but if you fix all synchonization, then it will come into the
picture.

Not yet, but after you have fixed f_pos, it will come into the picture.

I know that, but 2.3 is broken, 2.2 is ugly.
I wanted to say that we should NOT make the same fault again. Flags are
needed.
