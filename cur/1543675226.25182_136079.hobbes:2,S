Of course, but should't the AGP bios report itself during initialization 
even when 'Init PCI display first' is set, or is the legacy BIOS 
completely ignored on the secondary adapter?

The PCI card was installed afterwards to be able to use the computer at 
all since it now refuses to boot with the geforce card. I've tried to 
use the PCI card as the primary card and only use the geforce card with 
X to see if it'd work that way (which it didn't).
