Every time a file needs to be opened, the dir is opened and the
filename must be searched for.  With 10000 or more files in a
single dir, that takes time to scan all dir entries, and likely
wipes out the directory cache, or at least mucks with it.
Anyone concerned with file access performance should never put
that many files in a single dir.  Either amalgamate the files
into one file, or several files, and change the file access
logic in the app, or else create subdirectories and divide the
files into different dirs.
Hope this helps.
