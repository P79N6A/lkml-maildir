Good.  I was this -><- close to suggesting "no GUI" -- just didn't
send that part of the message.

So I think that you and Roman are close to agreement, when Roman
has the library backend ready.  Of course someone needs to do a
"reference implementation" with it also, but it doesn't need to
ship with the kernel.
