Hmm.. interesting.  This looks like same error with TP600X.

But this Samsung P35 don't have _GLK. So, I think TP 600x has
a different problem with Samsung P35.
Actually, Sanjoy has a workaround to solve TP 600X S3 issue.
What we need to do is to come up with a clean patch. 
It is on to-do list. 
Thanks,
Luming
