Hi all,
This may be a generic problem as far as a driver is concerned.
We need to handle an interrupt and inform the user space on the event and
pass the data correspodning to the event.
The event can be informed through SIGNAL and the signal handler can be
invoked in the user space. Then again for data, we need to have the
"copy_to_user" mechanism .
Is there any other effective mechanism(s) to handle the interrupt. I mean
we need to convey the event and or data to the user space(prefer -
asynchronously).
Please share your views.
Sanil.
