Are you using sys5 shared memory. If so that would probably explain it.
When the shm stuff was cleaned up the structure exposed to user space
shrank and libc5 uses it. This made some libc5 apps built versus 2.1.13x
crash on 2.0 (eg apache). Ive sent Linus the patches to put the extra
padding in the structure for libc5 users and its fixed in the 131ac code
