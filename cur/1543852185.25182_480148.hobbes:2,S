Hmm. Seems a bit fancier than necessary, but maybe reasonable. I'll
probably start with a single file listing all the different container
associations and we can turn it into a directory later as a finishing
touch.

Is it possible to dynamically extend the /proc/<pid>/ directory? If
not, then every container subsystem would involve a patch in
fs/proc/base.c, which seems a bit nasty.

We're currently planning on using cpusets for the memory node
isolation properties, but we have a whole bunch of other resource
controllers that we'd like to be able to hang off the same
infrastructure, so I don't think the need is that limited.

The naming is already in my patch. You can tell from the top-level
directory which containers are registered, since each one has an
xxx_enabled file to control whether it's in use; there's not a
separate /proc/containers file yet.
