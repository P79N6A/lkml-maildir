I've been maintaining one of the answers to this (anobjrmap, originally
from hugh). I still haven't removed page->mapcount because keeping
nr_mapped straight requires some care, though doing so should be feasible.
I could probably use some helpers to untangle it from the highpmd,
compile-time mapping->page_lock rwlock/spinlock switching, RCU
mapping->i_shared_lock, and O(1) proc_pid_statm() bits.
