What you are proposing is to reduce contention by having several different
locks for each of the global data structures.  The process tree, the task list,
the process groups and the sessions.  If this was all a really hot spot
then doing that might be useful.  In practice it doesn't really
address the problem that we have.  We have global locks we need to
take, and we have global data structures we need to modify.  The
result are global cache line bounces every time you write to the data
structure.
With purely reads on such a global data structure you are probably ok,
with respect to scalability as you can get shared cache lines.
Writing to a global data structure that is heavily read will generally
scale badly, simply because of cache line bounces.
So until some clever person figures out how to refactor the data
structures so we they are not global it is probably best not modify
them if we can avoid it.

It can work as well as anything else in readdir.  It can ensure that you don't
miss things that haven't been added or deleted during the while you are in
the middle of readdir.    I'm just after the usual Single Unix Spec/POSIX guarantees.
The same thing that are missing in the current readdir implementation.
I think the ideal case for a readdir would be a sequence number that
always increases, that is assigned each time a new directory entry (in
our case a task) is created.  This will ensure we see everything new
but not everything old.  The problem with that approach is that
all such counters eventually wrap.  The core problem is that we have
to give out an indefinite number of tokens that last for an indefinite
amount of time.
If we relax the rules and allow ourselves to miss new directory
entries then anything that provides a total ordering of the
entries, allows us to export the key by which the total ordering
is defined to user space, and provides the concept of finding the
entry at or after this key provides us with what we need to implement
a solid readdir implementation complete with supporting seeks.

It will be.  It pretty much has to be, and the actual accessor function
did not actually assume you were using the pid bitmap.  Merely that you
could traverse through pids in order.
