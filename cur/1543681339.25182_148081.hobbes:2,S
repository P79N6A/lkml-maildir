Hi,
From what I see (kernel 2.5.72), there is no implementation yet of RSA
in the CryptoAPI (in the kernel) - nor of any asymetric algorithm. Are
there any plans to do so (or not) ?
The only mails/posts I have seen concerning this matter are rather old
(at best november 2002). What's happened since then ? Has this issue
been abandonned ?
Axelle.
