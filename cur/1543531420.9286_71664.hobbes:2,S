He just UTTERY clueless. malloc() WILL happily overcommit HUGE amount of memory.
You'll need more then one process though (see sample below).

Exactly. Even more: if you'll READ from said page kernel will NOT allocate
it for you ! It'll count this page as RSS though.

Exactly.

Once again. fork() supposed to do COMPLETE copy of process. And COW is
just to speed up things, not to change semantic.

Oh. Instead of arguing in vain just make simple check. Take small program:
-- cut --
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc,char *argv[]) {
    /* Allocate 100MiB of memory */
    char *p=(char *)malloc(100*1024*1024);
    /* Not just read area to make sure compiler will not optimize anything */
/*
    int x;
    for (x=0;x<100*1024*1024;x++) {
        *p+=p[x];
    }
*/
    /* wait for keypress */
    getchar();
}
-- cut --
Start 10 copies with following command
-- cut --
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ; do { ./test $i & } ; done
-- cut --
And the type `ps l'. Here I got the following result:
-- cut --
[khim@localhost khim]$ ps l

Do you really think my non-existing swap can keep all 1000MiB of allocated
memory ? If you'll add for(...) from comment to program you'll see that ALL TEN
processes will have RSS of 50-60MiB at some time (while they still running not
stopped that is) ! Total of 500-600MiB of RSS while there are only 128MiB RAM
available (swap is completely disabled for test). If it's not overcommiting then
what IS overcommiting ???
