No. ACPICA only supports operation region handlers on a
per-address-space basis, not per-region.

As far as the AML interpreter is concerned, access to the SMBus is via
an operation region. So, each access to such a region would encompass a
single SMBus transaction. Also, the interpreter remains locked during
this access (I'm fairly sure) even though the EC driver is involved.

I think the spec is referring to any global namespace object. This
includes operation regions, so the answer is yes, as long as access to
the region does not block and cause the interpreter to be released. As
far as ACPICA, none of the default handlers for operation regions will
block.
