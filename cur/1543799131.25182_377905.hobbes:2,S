Can you do try the other way again, with sound/core/sound.c fixed too?
A regular driver really _should_ use the regular "module_init()" sequence 
(it is indeed just a compatibility define for "driver_init()").
The "late_init()" stuff is meant for stuff that literally runs after 
everything else is up and running, it might want all drivers functional 
(now, nobody really cares about a sound driver, so in that sense it would 
be ok..)
