Hello,
If the subject is not appropriate to this list, please point me a proper
mailing list.
While I am building modutils-2.4.27 by FC5, I've got following errors:
../../obj/obj_kallsyms.c:204: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
../../obj/obj_kallsyms.c:279: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
Any helps for what was I missing?
Thank you.
Jim
