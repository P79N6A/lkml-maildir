$ modprobe --show-depends `cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:1f.3/modalias`
WARNING: Not loading blacklisted module i2c_i801
FATAL: Module pci:v00008086d000027DAsv000010CFsd00001388bc0Csc05i00 not found.
And the blacklist entry is:
# causes failure to suspend on HP compaq nc6000 (Ubuntu: #10306)
blacklist i2c_i801
Looks like Ubuntu decided to wallpaper over a problem rather than fixing it
