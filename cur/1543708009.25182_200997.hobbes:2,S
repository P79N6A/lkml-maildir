> I believe the question was "which shell expects the name in argv[2]
The question is more like: examine each shell's argument parsing code to
determine which ones will or will not be affected by this.  For a change
like this, someone needs to actually look at the code for each major
shell, and verify their reading of the code with a little experimentation.
