i've merged it to the -52-11 patch that, and i've uploaded it a couple 
of minutes ago.
i have done a number of cleanups on it - e.g. instead of latency logging 
it's now called latency histogram, and i've also fixed a number of 
coding style issues. Please double-check that it's still OK, seems to 
work here.
would be nice to clean up the impact of the latency-histogram code some 
more though: e.g. the #ifdef jungle check_critical_timing() is 
disgusting. Could be cleaned up by always recording the latency_type 
being currently traced into a new tr->latency_type field, and then using 
that in check_critical_timing().
