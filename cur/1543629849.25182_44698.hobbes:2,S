Hello
As of 2.5.6 there is some support in the serial driver for the 16850
automatic hardware handshake feature, in particular the automatic CTS is
enabled, but not the automatic RTS. Nor are the hysteresis levels set.
Why? I tried enabling all these features, it helps a good deal improving
the reliability of the data transfer, but still, at high baud-rates
(460800, 921600) and in the presence of user-space load data can be
overwritten in the driver's buffer. Why isn't this checked?
Thanks
Guennadi
