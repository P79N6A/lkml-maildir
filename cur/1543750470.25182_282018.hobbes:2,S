I think so too, this is the problem most
likely. However, my cd-roms are not that
ancient, I expect there are millions of
the like ones around. Breaking autoclose
for all of them after it worked for ages,
is no good IMO.

I don't think so. It is safe to assume the
tray is opened, at least it worked in the
past (or were there the real problems with
this?) You can always try to close it only
once, and if that still returns 0, then
bail out. One extra closing attempt should
not do any harm I suppose. That's exactly
what my patch does (I hope). And that's most
likely how it used to work before. I'll be
disappointed if autoclose will remain broken -
it was the very usefull feature, it will be
missed. Unless there are the real technical
reasons against the old behaviour, of course.
