As I understand the original message, before the compilation and after the
system is in a "similar" state ("the same" processes should be running; even
less of them if some were killed by OOM).
:              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
: -/+ buffers/cache:      49908     205780
: Swap:       152576          0     152576
~49 MB in use befere the test,
: -/+ buffers/cache:      14844     240844
: Swap:       152576     152576          0
~149 MB allocated swap. By processes of total size of 49 MB ? Strange...
Either the test shows some leak in running userspace processes (they
allocate a lot of memory) as an effect of memory shortage (strange) or there
is some leak in the kernel. Or the test is bad (something else is running
when it finishes).
Am I right ?
