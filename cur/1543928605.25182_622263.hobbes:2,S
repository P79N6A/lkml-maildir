Hi!
Sorry for long delay. I got rtc wakeup to work... once per boot. On
2.6.24-rc3.

Oops. Ok, this is thinkpad x60, if that helps.

I see... so situation is not nice :-(.

Good. that actually works.

Thanks. Will put it into Doc*/rtc.txt.

It seems to be working now, not sure what changed.
rtc-sysfs.c: why this?
        if (alarm > now) {
                /* Avoid accidentally clobbering active alarms; we
can't
                 * entirely prevent that here, without even the
minimal
                 * locking from the /dev/rtcN api.
                 */
                retval = rtc_read_alarm(rtc, &alm);
                if (retval < 0)
                        return retval;
                if (alm.enabled)
                        return -EBUSY;
                alm.enabled = 1;
People should not be "accidentally" writing to sysfs files...
