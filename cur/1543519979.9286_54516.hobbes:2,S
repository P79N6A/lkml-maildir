With CONFIG_MODULES disabled, too?

I haven't checked this with previous kernels, my box is slow, and
previously I've only run with module support.

After some further investigation, and careful "make clean"ing, things
appear to break down in signal.c, when EXPORT_SYMBOL is called.  If I
configure the kernel without loadable modules, include/linux/modules.h
appears to #define EXPORT_SYMBOL et al. to "error
EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_defined".
The actual error is copious instances of
  signal.c:613: parse error before `EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_defined'
  signal.c:613: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
Any clues as to what could be wrong with my setup (otherwise a stock
Debian "stable" distro)?  I'll attach the .config, just in case.
