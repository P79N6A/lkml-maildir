	Using 2.2.14 UP w/userspace nfs, I had it hang like this twice when mounting
a cfs encrypted dir within the first day after installing the nfs stuff. (Id
been using cfs for years and years with no problems previously) I upgraded to
2.2.15pre4/5/6 and havent had it hang since. When it hung, it was like you
describe, ctl-alt-del didnt even work, though the machine did respond to
pings...
	For what its worth...
