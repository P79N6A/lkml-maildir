I do not trust either of those backtraces.  There is no way to get from
do_nmi to do_exit.  The presence of "unknown" entries indicates that
the cpu 0 back trace is bad.  Also all the ebp pointers are suspect,
they are way out of range for the task addresses.  You could be looking
at a stack overrun or just random corruption of kernel data.
If you can reproduce the problem, set KDBDEBUG=0xff and bt.  That will
debug kdb and produce a lot of output.  Send it to me, although I
suspect it will just prove that you have stack corruption.
