On an Intel processor, it seems that the safe and simple route
is if the system exports C2 or deeper, don't use the LAPIC timer.
(which is what 2.6.21-rc5 is doing as of this moment)
We may be able to white-list some systems over time.

The nx6325 (Turion 64 X2) exports only C1.
I'm not sure how the conclusion was drawn that it has
a broken lapic timer as reflected in the "nolapic_timer" patch:
+               /*
+                * BIOS exports only C1 state, but uses deeper power
+                * modes behind the kernels back.
+                */
+                 .callback = lapic_check_broken_bios,
+                 .ident = "HP nx6325",
+                 .matches = {
+                       DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "HP Compaq nx6325"),
+                 },
+        },
But if this is true, then I don't know how to determine on
an AMD system if the LAPIC timer is guaranteed to work --
even for systems with just C1.
Jordan, William,
can you clarify?
