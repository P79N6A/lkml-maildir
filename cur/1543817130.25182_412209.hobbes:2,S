One of the issues we have tried to address is the ability to provide some
form of a common ground for all the statistics to co-exist. Various methods
were discussed for exchanging data between kernel and user space, genetlink
was suggested often and the clear winner.
To that end, we have created a taskstats.c file. Any subsystem wanting
to add their statistics and sending it to user space can add their own
types by extending taskstats.c (changing the version number) and creating
their own types using genetlink. They will have to do the following
1. Add statistics gathering in their own subsystem
2. Add a type to taskstats.c, extend it and use data from (1) and send
   it to user space.
The data from various subsystems can co-exist. I feel that this could serve as
the basic common infrastructure to begin with and refined later (depending on
the needs of other people).
Thoughts?
