Human and a looney who wishes Monty Python's Flying Circus still

Exactly what I am doing :)
I know bonnie++ is mostly used for benchmarking, but it also is a
great tool to hammer down your hard-disks.
I also break RAID1 arrays volunteerly (spelling) and resync them to do
some stress tests on the disks, but I dont recommend others to do
these kind of tests, unless you dont worry about your data, or are a
fruitcake, like me.
