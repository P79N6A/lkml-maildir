I'll probably drop staircase soon, give nicksched a whizz for a couple of
cycles.  You're welcome to join the queue ;)
But let me re-repeat again that CPU scheduler problems tend to take a
_long_ time to turn up - you make some change and two months later some
person with a weird workload on expensive hardware hits a nasty corner
case.  So I do think that we'd have to hit a nasty problem with the current
scheduler to go making deep changes.
Although most of the fragility has been in CPU/node/HT balancing rather
than in the timeslice allocation area.  I assume you're not touching the
former.  It's the desktop users who seem to be more affected by the
timeslice allocation algorithms, and the testing turnaround is much faster
there.
