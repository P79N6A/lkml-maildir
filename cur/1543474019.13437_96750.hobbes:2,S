It's not exactly clear what is more "right" thing to do: add support for
C++ try/catch/throw in kernel or to remove try/catch/throw from driver but
yes, adding try/catch/throw support in kernel is not trivial. Since sources
of libgcc are available in sources of egcs (hint, hint) it's doable but I'm
not sure which solution is more "right"...
