After the recent patches that went in to the kernel, I downloaded version
2.6.13-rc8-git8, compiled, and now the box powers off correctly. Seems my
setup is working fine again now. However, I didn't check if this is
working ok all the times, because it seems in another thread that someone
is having problems to get his system powering off reliably.
But the precise problem I reported is gone. Thank you Eric.
