Greetings,
With regard to hardware interrupt servicing on 2.2, how are nested
interrupts handled on UP?  From reading the code, it appears that they are
possible on x86 (assuming no SA_INTERRUPT), but not on Alpha?
If they are possible, is the depth limited only by memory for a new stack
page..?
thanks,
-bp
