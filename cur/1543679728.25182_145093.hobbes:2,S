I am using the special driver in X and this works fine after a cold
boot. However after a hibernation of my laptop the mouse doesn't work
and syslog reports:
Jul  3 17:05:34 pangsit kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Jul  3 17:05:43 pangsit last message repeated 968 times
Jul  3 17:05:49 pangsit kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Jul  3 17:06:14 pangsit last message repeated 3773 times
Jul  3 17:07:12 pangsit kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
[etc]
I have to reboot my laptop to get it working again.
