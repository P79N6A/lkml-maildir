I don't think having libc do it. In order to use these macros,
you always had to #include <linux/unistd.h> or <asm/unistd.h>.
Putting the headers into a libc file means that user code
would need to change its includes, when it really should
just use <sys/syscall.h>.
Changing the libc copy of asm/unistd.h is against our current
plan to get to a point where `make headers_install' gets
you a working tree. _If_ we want to have it in there, it needs
to be in the kernel source.
