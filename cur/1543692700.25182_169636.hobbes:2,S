OpenOffice uses sched_yield() in strange ways which causes it to
get hopelessly starved on 2.6 kernels.  I think RH have a fixed version,
but I don't know if that has propagated into the upstream yet.
So...  Don't worry about OpenOffice too much.  Is the problem reproducible
with other applications?
