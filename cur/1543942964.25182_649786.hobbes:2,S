I still think this muxed mmc host thing is a bad idea, but it's your nightmare...

This is unrelated to the slot stuff and should be in its own patch. Also, it should probably be in the core, not a driver.

This is also unrelated. From what I've seen, the OMAP is a SD controller and does not support high speed MMC. The fact that you also conditionally set the max frequency later also suggests that this code is entirely incorrect.

You have a bit of a race here with userspace in case you use the uevent to trigger things.
