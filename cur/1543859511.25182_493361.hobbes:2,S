That makes NFS unhappy, see nfs_release_page().

Yeah, I have to tinker with my test setup to make it fail again. Maybe I
have to add more seeds, that seemed to make a difference, it was
impossible to trigger with a single seed.
FWIW I also added some scribble past i_size checks in nobh_writepage()
and block_write_full_page().
FWIW2 I straced rtorrent for a bit and it does an aweful lot of mmap
calls and relatively few msync(MS_ASYNC);munmap(), and no truncate apart
from creating sparse files at the beginning.

I failed to compile a kernel with that patch (100% iowait and a bunch of
processes stuck in D state), but sysrq-t was borked (only numbers no
symbols) have yet to retry - I noticed you kicked the unwinder?.
