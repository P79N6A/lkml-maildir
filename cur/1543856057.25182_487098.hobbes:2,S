It would be nice to eliminate libphy-dont-do-that.patch if poss - that was
a rogue akpm patch aimed at some incomprehensible gobbledigook in the
netdev tree (and to fix the current_is_keventd-not-exported-to-modules

That might of course mean that someone will hit it more firmly and it'll
get fixed.
