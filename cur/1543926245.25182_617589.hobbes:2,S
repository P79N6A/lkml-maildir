Ohhhhh.... kayyyyy.... *shudders*
It really violates the abstract model of "read" pretty badly.  "Read"
is "fill in the buffer with data from the device", not "do some
arbitrary stuff with this area of memory".
I'd prefer to have a transaction() system call like I suggested to
Nick rather than overloading read() like this.

There's all sorts of possible ways that it could be implemented.  On
the one hand we have an actual proposed implementation, and on the
other we have various people saying "oh but it could be implemented
this other way" without providing any actual code.
Now if those people can show that their way of doing it is
significantly simpler and better than the existing implementation,
then that's useful.  I really don't think that doing a whole new
net protocol family is a simpler and better way of doing a performance
monitor interface, though.
Paul.
