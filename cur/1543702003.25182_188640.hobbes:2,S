Subject: PPTP_CONNECTRACK_NAT for latest kernel?

is there a PPTP_CONNECTRACK_NAT patch for the latest 2.4 kernel?  I have
not found one later than 2.4.22 in CVS...unless I am looking in the
wrong place.
Is there a place to find it or simple instructions to make this work
with a later kernel?
Thanks
