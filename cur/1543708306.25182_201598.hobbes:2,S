The first two big ones are:
- Doesn't like gdb 6.0 (You cannot assume the first packet is Hc...)
- Wierdities with kgdb_killed_or_detached / kgdb_might_be_resumed
  (both can die).
- All of the function pointer games (of which the weak symbols, but not
  all of them) are a part of.
- Issues w/ handling 'D' and 'k' packets cleaner (and I think there was
  a correctness fix in there, too, but it was a while ago).
- Don't ACK packets sitting on the line
- kgdb_schedule/process_breakpoint, required for kgdboe, harmless to use
  on serial.
There's still a lot of stuff I checked into linux-2.6-kgdb that's
non-trivially important
