Maybe.  As I stated earlier though, the trick is going to be stopping
the leak before you are completely dead so that you can get the data
from memleak out of /proc and save it.  If you have a serial console
or lp console and can still cat a file at OOM time, you're golden.
(hmm.. maybe I should add a SysRq-dump-memleak-data button)
If it's userland exausting memory, memleak won't help at all.  Set
resource limits on userland processes first, and watch ps output like
a hawk for root processes. If OOM happens without anyone in userland
being visibly guilty, then its time to look for a possible kernel leak.
