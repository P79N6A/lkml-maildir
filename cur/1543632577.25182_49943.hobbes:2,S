Suggestion #1: make up an inittask table (bad idea, huge table) that gets 
freed on end of init.
Suggestion #2: each big subsystem (net, scsi, pcmcia, etc.) gets a lock 
that is engaged when starting, and is checked by the subsystems. The 
subsystems' init won't take place unless the parent subsystem is up. At 
end of init, these locks get freed.
Suggestion #3 (possibly the worst ever): let the subsubsystems be init'ed 
by the subsystems, using #ifdef'd calls...
I must leave now, sorry.
Regards,
Thunder
