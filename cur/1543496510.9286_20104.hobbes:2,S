I don't think it is a good idea to always call the unlock - 90+ of all
*_user's in the kernel are not performance critical at all (in setup only
functions), but the call is still inlined, so it is just unnecessary code 
bloat.
Also the unlock_kernel thing is not the right 2.3 fix - there the code should
be fixed to have fine grained locks - but just a bandaid to fix the worst 
scaling problems in 2.2 with minimal changes.
[ Small data point:
% fred:/usr/src/linux% find -type f | xargs cat | grep 'copy.*user' | wc -l 
   2724
Assuming about 1000 of them are used in a realistic configuration, and you
only added 20 bytes to each of them that is already 2K for not much gain.
Then 2K and 4K there and someday you have a bloated monster. Please think
twice before adding anything to a commonly used inline function.]
