Why do you cast away the const warning?  Why not just make pid a pointer
to const?  drm_get_dev already has the const qualifier, so somebody
realised what the right thing to do was.
But looking at this code just reinforces the basic problem -- that DRM
does everything wrong and it needs shooting in the head.
