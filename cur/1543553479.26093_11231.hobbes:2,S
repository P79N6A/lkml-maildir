They're available here:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/bigmem-large-mapping-1.bz2
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/bigmem-large-task-1.bz2
But they're against 2.2.x + bigmem. The first one is still valid (and it's
similar to the one discussed here). The second one doesn't apply to 2.4.x
and both vmlinux.lds and PAGE_OFFSET should be changed that way to
make it to work there.
