Hello,
> So please don't remove bootp, rarp on the other hand is obsolote imho.
   Neither shall we remove RARP as at least older Sun firmware does support
only RARP and I don't see much sense in having to run both BOOTP and RARP
to make both the firmware and the kernel happy.
				Have a nice fortnight
