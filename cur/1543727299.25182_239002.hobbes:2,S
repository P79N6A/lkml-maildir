Linus, are you saying that anyone who refuses to re-license their work under
license of your choice, is an ass? Or just the ones who catch you
re-licencing their work without permission?

I say that loop-AES is GPL-compatible.
Most of the files in loop-AES are licensed under GPL. Some files have less
restrictive license, but are still licensed under GPL-compatible license.
I am not aware of any files in loop-AES that are GPL-incompatible.
