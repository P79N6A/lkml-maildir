Just thought I would let everyone know that my A7N8X deluxe is up to:
 13:34:38 up 18 days, 18:50,  7 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.03, 1.02
with 2.6.3-mm1 and no other patches.  I did put Ross's latest
idle=C1halt patch in their but forgot to pass the command-line arg.  I
do have disconnect turned off here, with it on my speakers make a high
pitched buzzing noise.  Of course, acpi, apic, local apic etc is
turned on.  So does anyone have a sure fire way to hang this thing
yet?
