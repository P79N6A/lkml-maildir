is there a way to ask google "only stuff in the last year"?
Asking because "noapic" in 2.4 was the standard "try this" answer when
people had a bios that had busted MPS (but good ACPI)...

well to some degree it does; if it's one patch causing it narrowing it
down at least somewhat in time would help ;)

alternative is that more new machines showed up that need it somehow, eg
not really a regression just something else. Different approach is
needed for hunting that down. But to be realistic we need to narrow
things down a bit, which means
1) Only care about SMP machines. APIC on true UP (no
Hyperthreading/Dualcore) is a thing no hardware vendor tests (Microsoft
doesn't use it) and is just too likely to trip up SMM and other bad BIOS
stuff. 
 * exception is probably people who don't WANT to use apic but where it
somehow gets used anyway; if that happens we probably have the magic
bullet that causes the regression :)
2) Only care about ACPI using kernels. Non-ACPI uses MPS tables for
this, but most vendors hardly maintain those anymore at all and they are
generally just /dev/random nowadays
3) Ignore overclocking; if you overclock using the FSB the apic busses
run out of spec as well; can be a huge timewaster in debug time.
