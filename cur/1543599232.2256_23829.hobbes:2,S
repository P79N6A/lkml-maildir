Hi,
with 2.4.8 + pcmcia-cs modules 3.1.27 i see the problem that i put a
CF Card with the pcmcia adapter into the pcmcia slot - It gets detected
corrent and i mount the drive/vfat partition. Then i eject the card
(without unmounting) and the "virtual ide controller" does not get freed.
All processes still accessing the drive get killed which is completely ok
Means - the next time i insert a CF Card/Microdrive with the adapter
it does not get hde it gets hdg and so forth. It seems the driver
never realizes the controller has been gone.

     Why is it called "common sense" when nobody seems to have any?
