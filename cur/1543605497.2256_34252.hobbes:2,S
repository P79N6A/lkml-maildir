I've been playing with a USB pendrive.  Worked great under 2.4.13pre3, but
now under pre5, the system will not recognize it and not autoload
usb-storage.  Also, if the input event module (evdev) is loaded, and you 
manually load usb-storage, it hangs your terminal.  After a while I get 
the error:
Oct 19 18:06:32 whiskey kernel: uhci.c: uhci_transfer_result: called for 
URB c1c69b60 not in flight?
This is happening on two different systems, an IBM 600X and Athalon based 
system (both using the uhci driver).
Once I go back to 2.4.13pre3, the problem goes away...
