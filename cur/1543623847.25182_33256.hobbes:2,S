I was thinking about something like automatically tagged globally 
descrete patch sets.  It would then be fairly simple to create a tool 
that simply scanned, merged, and checked in that patch as a set.  Is 
something like this what you have in mind?

Would having something like VIM or Emacs display a patch diff with 
providing keystroke level merge and unmerge get toward helpful for 
something like this, or is the need too complex to address that way?

Can you be more specific?  (i.e. are you looking for merging, 
syncronization, or copies?  In other words what do you need that CVS + 
rsync are unacceptable for?)
