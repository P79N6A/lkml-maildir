I know it isn't ... so, have you `setcd` installed in any case?  If not,
install it, and look:
setcd -s /dev/cdrom
/dev/cdrom:
Auto open tray:      set
If something like this shows, then it's your problem....
Setcd utility is, I think, primary for ATAPI CD-ROM's, but it works on
SCSI too, I just checked ...
