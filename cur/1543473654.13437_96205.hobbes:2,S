In my experience, lots of times I get corrupted files after unclean
shutdown, that is, lots of my log files finish with zeros on their end
(probably after fsck pass which kinda fixes things in those files).
It's tedious job after that, to go and delete those unwanted zeroes
from the files, and I would be much happier if FS would indeed behave
like you're saying (lose here and there, but do NOT corrupt data).
Maybe it's the fsck program bug, after all? :)
