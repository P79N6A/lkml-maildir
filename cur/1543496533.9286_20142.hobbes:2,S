Hi all, 
        I do not know if I am having alucinations, but it's possible
that in some subtle way kernel vm affects memory footprint of
applications? I am running gnome (same version) till 2.2.5, 
and never saw this:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers  cached

System is responsive and ok, but I am quite preoccupied for when the 
swap will be filled... I am thinking to a change in the kernel that 
triggers very bad some leakage in gnome-libs. I am quite positive 
that it is the first time my system is using more than a few MBytes 
of swap.
