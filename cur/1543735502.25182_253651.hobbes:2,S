   Well, I got your point.
   I promise I will not use udev ;-)
   For last embedded system where I have had external usb storage used 
for firmware upgrade, I used preloading of usb-storage - and everything 
worked well. Seems it worked better than udev will ever worked - with 0 
user space calls and immediate accessibility of /dev/sda ;-)))
   I will not try to argue, it is rather pointless for me at moment, 
being unemployed and far from any of my systems.
P.S. Funny diversion from OpenBSD thinking. OpenBSD intentionally do not 
support loadale modules, to prevent _any_ user space attempt to modify 
running kernel.
P.P.S. Another day, I hope, you will understand that right system need 
to provide people with two opposite ways of doing things. Sometimes it 
is advantage to be event-based and asynchronous, sometimes it is very 
convient to be dumb & synchronous. This two options are not mutually 
exclusive. I/O subsystem does both ways: you can be dumb and synchronous 
with read() (as most applications do - regardless of actual I/O being 
event-driven), or asynchronous with aio_* stuff (sacrificing simplicity 
of application). Giving a choice is right way to go.

   If you are not  yet threaded - so that must be done.
