What if you need to increase the number of arguments passed to a system
call later?  That would be an API change since the size of syslet_uatom
would change?
Also, what if you have an ABI such that:
sys_foo(int fd, long long a)
where:
 arg[0] <= fd
 arg[1] <= unused
 arg[2] <= low 32-bits a
 arg[3] <= high 32-bits a
it seems you need to point arg[1] to some valid but dummy variable.
How do you propose syslet users know about these kinds of ABI issues
(including the endian-ness of 64-bit arguments) ?
