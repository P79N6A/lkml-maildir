Hi
Your patch for stack alignment on i386 is wrong. -mprefered-stack-boundary 
is log2 of the stack alignment (read gcc man page). On AMD64 16-byte 
alignment is enforced because of SSE, on i386 minimal alignment is 4 
bytes.
See the code in gcc that triggered your error:
       i = atoi (ix86_preferred_stack_boundary_string);
       if (i < (TARGET_64BIT ? 4 : 2) || i > 12)
         error ("-mpreferred-stack-boundary=%d is not between %d and 12", 
i,
                TARGET_64BIT ? 4 : 2);
       else
         ix86_preferred_stack_boundary = (1 << i) * BITS_PER_UNIT;
You are actually dealing with gcc bug, not Linux bug --- when gcc is 
compiled with AMD64 support it enforces 16-byte alignment even in 32-bit 
mode.
Rather let it be as it was, adding -mpreferred-stack-boundary=4 doesn't 
make sense, because it is default.
