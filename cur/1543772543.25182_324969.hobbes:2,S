This is what should happen:
1) client A sends SYN to server B.
2) attcker C sends spoofed SYN-ACK to client A purporting to be server B.
3) client A sends RST to server B.
The RST packet is sent by client A using its sequence numbers.  Therefore
it will pass the sequence number check on server B.
4) server B resets the connection.
Cheers,
