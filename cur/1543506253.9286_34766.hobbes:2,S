   Well, there are indeed people who DO use knfsd in production
environments, without visible problems. I wouldnt say this three months
ago, but now i can. Current knfsd seems to do the job. I believe only
performance could be tweaked. Now, i have yet to see a vendor releasing an
updated knfsd package. Red Hat has been updating like crazy 6.0, but they
dont care about knfsd, and from what i read in redhat mailing list, they
dont even know how to support it.
