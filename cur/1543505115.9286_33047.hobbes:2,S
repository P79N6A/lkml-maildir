Guys I implemented kmem_cache_destroy() long ago!! I posted a patch alone
with explanation plus testing and testing kernel module as well!! Since
it's been _ignored_ by _everybody_ out there (even from people like AV who
asked for it)  it stayed long time into my 2.2.x andrea-patches (as tons
of other good stuff!!).
Luckily at that time I did a directory in my ftp area (unlike for the
other good stuff). I am pretty sure the patch will apply cleanly on 2.3.x
as well since the slab is been unchanged over the time.
