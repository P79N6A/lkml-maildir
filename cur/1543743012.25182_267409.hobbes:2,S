I'm actually running a reasonably recent BK pull of 2.6.10-rc1 as of a couple of days ago, but I did 
some pretty severe testing and evaluation with my raid disks removed and replaced with spares before 
I let it loose on the real media. I have applied those patches and I'll beat on it for a few hours 
and see how it goes. I have some pretty defined cron jobs that make it easy to reproduce.
Regards,
Brad
