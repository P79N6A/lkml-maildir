This is whitespace-damaged.
Please fix broken mailers. I generally don't bother to fix up whitespace
damage from people who can't bother to have a good mailer. It's just not 
worth it - if I try to fix it up (even if it is often trivial), it just 
means that people will continue to send crap patches to me.
