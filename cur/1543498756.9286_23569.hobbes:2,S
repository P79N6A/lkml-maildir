Sorry to post this here but I tried dozens of net searches and posts
to the ftape mailing list to no avail.
Can someone give me a quick overview of how to use my Iomega Ditto 2GB
parallel tape drive?
I have been using Linux for 5 years and I really know my way around
but this one has me stumped.  I've tried to compile in every option
relating to parallel, including the ftape, parallel ide drivers but it
doesn't detect the tape drive.
I don't need a lot of help, just need to know how the device is
detected so I can use tar.
Thanks!!
Mark
