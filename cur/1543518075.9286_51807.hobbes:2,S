revoke() is needed anyway (for /dev/vcsa, /dev/sound, /dev/fb0 for
example), so I guess
*) first implement revoke()
*) then talk about this issue again
I still think that adding feature to truncate file before deletion
into rm would make you happy, Andrea. That handles both open() and
link() cases nicely.

PS: That new switch to rm looks really nice, think about it.
