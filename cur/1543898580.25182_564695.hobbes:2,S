I simply think that the anonymous shared mapping
is a bit of an ad-hoc interface. The result is that
whenever you extend it in some way, you get a problem
elsewhere. So I just stopped using it.

That's certainly true, you were agree with this even in
the past. It is more consistent to have it that way. The
only question is whether the side-effects you outlined,
do outweight the benefit, or not. But since it was you
who outlined the problems, I guess you have the right to
say that they, while being valid, do not outweight the benefit. :)
I am not going to oppose my own patch, of course.

OK. And I guess comparing /dev/mem mapping with
/dev/shm/xxx mapping is not valid too, since the
/dev/mem perhaps doesn't permit ftruncate().
So do you say, silently mapping the private anonymous
pages for /dev/mem is a correct behaveour, even though
the /proc/pid/maps shows that the mapping is shared?

Well, I simply thought that something like this is
needed anyway, not only for that problem. But then
vmsplice() appeared, so of course such an mopen() is
no longer much relevant. I am just puzzled as to why
the pipe was used for vmsplice() and can't find an
answer, but I am probably missing something obvious...

No, of course not, at least, not any more.
Back in 2004 it was a good idea, but now there is no
longer a vacant place for this wonderfull syscall. :)

The only scenario I can image where you would prefer
the anonymous mmaps over the Posix SHM, is when you want
to manage many small memory areas separately, and do not
want to track them back to their fd's. But even then this
probably doesn't save more than a few dozens of code lines. :)

IIRC this view was never under any doubts. The discussion
was only whether or not to count a few problems you pointed.

OK, no problems. Except that I've already forgotten the
details, and pretty much lost the need for that patch.
So let's assume the authorship is yours. :)
