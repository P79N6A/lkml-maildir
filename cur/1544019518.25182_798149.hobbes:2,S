Well, to put this into perspective: The bswap inline assembly was
introduced in Linux-1.3.51 "Greased Weasel", back in 1995 and at
no time it was ever visible to user space, unless the code manually
included <linux/config.h> (which we broke) or defined CONFIG_M486,
CONFIG_X86_BSWAP and/or __KERNEL__, depending on the kernel version.
I take this as a strong indication that user space applications
won't generally expect to get the bswap instruction from including
the kernel headers. For the longest time, we actually had
/* For avoiding bswap on i386 */
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#include <linux/config.h>
#endif
which I read as explicitly using the portable i386 version for
all user space.
