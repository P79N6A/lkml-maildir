Incorrect.  If request_region() fails, drivers are coded to _not_ touch 
the hardware.  That's the entire purpose of the whole charade: to avoid 
having two devices responding to the same io accesses.
If your driver is talking to the hardware after request_region() fails, 
it is BROKEN plain and simple.
