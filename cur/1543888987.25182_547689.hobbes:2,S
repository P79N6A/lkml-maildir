AFAICT, NORET_TYPE must've been introduced to silence gcc _warnings_,
and not do actually do anything useful that affects functionality in any way.
So the way to "test" your patch would be to see if there is any increase /
decrease in the number of *warnings* blurted out by gcc during kernel build
(best would be to build with various gcc versions on various platforms :-)
