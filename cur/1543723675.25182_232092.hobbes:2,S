You may be able to check for yourself precisely which change caused
trouble for you. The only very recent change is one that makes the
kernel more permissive.
Give details on what versions work for you, what versions don't.
Give the exact error messages. Give the first few sectors of the
filesystem that you cannot mount but can mount with an earlier kernel.
