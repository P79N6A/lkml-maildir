Oh right, I forgot.  Anyway, the card reset program needs to get at this stuff 
somehow.

That would be nice, maybe an extra resource or something?  I haven't looked at 
the sparc code, but it probably deals with this (sn2 has platform specific

sn2 does have multiple PCI segments, we just don't export them yet.
