Actually I don't disagree at all, I'm sorry if I have been so easy to 
misunderstand. All I'm asking for is to make static tracing possible if 
reasonably possible. I know that pure static tracing will always be second 
choice, but if we can _reasonably_ support it, why shouldn't we do it?
bye, Roman
