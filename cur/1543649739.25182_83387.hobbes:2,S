That's one of my personal goals: to mandate some amount of sanity in the 
namespace organization. Without it, sysfs is basically just a modernized 
procfs.

I do not view those as necessarily competing goals. The mission statement 
of sysfs is to "export kernel objects, their attributes, and their 
relation to other objects". 
EVMS, like any other subsystem, has a set of objects and methods to
operate on them, as exported via attributes. They have their have their
own object hierarchy, and in no way do I want to dilute that (or pollute
anything else ;).  sysfs should be able to handle this. It does today,
though it's not as seamless as I would prefer it.
I would rather mature the API and consolidate the common code, than have N 
copies of the same filesystem, each with a slightly different purpose, in 
existence. There are so many benefits:
- Less code duplication, and less places to fix identical bugs. 
- It makes it easier to write for; instead of having to copy n' paste a
  new filesystem to export your subsystem's objects, you can add a field 
  to a structure and call a function.
- It's easier for the user to mount one filesystem and get everything, 
  instead of trying to figure out what fs has what ifno. 
- It's easier to associate objects between subsystems, since you can 
  internally create relative symlinks between two objects (and soon with a
  single call).
