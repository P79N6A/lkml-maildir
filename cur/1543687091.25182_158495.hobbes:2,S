You got it right...
...unfortunately the current options are very non-obvious.  Linux kernel 
config has always presented a "subsystem switch", and under that, you 
have a bunch of options and modules and such.  It is not obvious to me 
at all that _disabling_ CONFIG_ACPI_HT means that CONFIG_ACPI will 
simply never appear.  And users who want ACPI, but don't have 
HyperThreading, would probably think similarly.  I think the current 
thread shows it generates at least a little bit of confusion, too.
To me, it makes sense for CONFIG_ACPI_HT to require CONFIG_ACPI -- from 
a Kconfig standpoint -- but not the other way around.  My first time 
configuring with the new options, I wanted to turn off CONFIG_ACPI_HT 
and turn on CONFIG_ACPI, but was frustrated when the config system 
wouldn't allow it.
I actually think the old method was a bit less confusing -- 
CONFIG_ACPI=N would never prompt me for any other ACPI config option. 
But if I wanted only the HT stuff, you had CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY :)
So... concrete suggestions?  Overall, IMO, move everything under 
CONFIG_ACPI, or, make CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT a _peer_ option, whose selection 
or lackthereof doesn't affect CONFIG_ACPI visibility at all.
