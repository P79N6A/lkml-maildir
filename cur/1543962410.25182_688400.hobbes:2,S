Not really hard, is it? Just look at something like oom_adj
static ssize_t myprocpid_euid_write(struct file *file,
    const char __user *inbuf, size_t size)
{
	struct task_struct *task;
	char buf[sizeof("4294967296")];
	unsigned int amount = min(size, sizeof(buf) - 1);
	if (copy_from_user(buf, inbuf, amount) != 0)
		return -EFAULT;
	buf[amount] = '\0';
	task = get_proc_task(file->f_path.dentry->d_inode);
	if (task == NULL)
		return -ESRCH;
	/* do error checking */
	task->euid = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 0);
	put_task_struct(task);
	return size;
}
So far the theory..
