Could you try to merge your work? Or at least: look at each others work. 
For example Krzysiek/Michal's implementation has wake-one semantics, 
which is IMHO a requirement.
Krzysiek: What is MQ_IOC_CLOSE? It looks like a stale ioctl. Please 
remove such code from the patch.
The last time I looked at your patch I noticed a race between creation and setting queue attributes. Did you fix that?

I personally prefer syscalls, but that's just my personal preference. 
For example the notification info is a structure, and printing it to a 
text stream and then parsing it back again is just odd. And I don't see 
how you can fix the O_CREAT+unusual mq_maxmsg races.
Why do you check against MQ_MAXMSG in user space? That's wrong. The 
kernel will reject too large limits, probably depending on 
/proc/sys/kern/ configuration. Checking in user space doesn't gain 
anything, except that you loose the ability for runtime changes.
Please reuse the load_msg/store_msg functions instead of a 
kmalloc(arg.msg_len, GFP_KERNEL) + copy_from_user. kmalloc(16384) is not 
reliable - it needs a continuous block of 16 kB, and after a long 
runtime, the memory is so fragmented that such memory may not exist. 
This is a known problem for x86_64: They would prefer to have 16 kB 
blocks for the stack, but this results in errors during stress testing.
proc_write_max_queues: off-by-one error. tmp[16] ='\0' overwrites the stack.
Is is necessary that the filesystem is visible to user space? What about 
chroot environments, or environments with per-user mount points. I don't 
like the dependence on /proc/mounts.

Do you know if Ulrich Drepper has looked at your user space libraries? 
Your code must end up in glibc, and he's the maintainer.
