Hello Tomi

Thanks. I'm using the latest patch from Jeroen for a month now (in a 2.4.16 kernel - the 2.4.17 kernel seems to have - not HAM related - problems). It seems to work fine.
Do you know if a patch against the "protocol is buggy" messages is also planned? I think it will be long before the HAM programs will be switched to the new packet-driver and it is a bit pointless to have the logs floaded with these messages. It's better to have one "depricated" warning once when opening the socket with AF_INET or PF_INIT and SOCK_PACKET making clear what's causing it.
Kind regards,
Henk.
