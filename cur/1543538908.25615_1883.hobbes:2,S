Subject: Reading /proc/[nnn]/mem only gives ESRCH or EACCES

I'm interested in looking at the memory of a process (running 'strings' on
it.) I expected that '/proc/[nnn]/mem' would be the logical choice to
give me the process image, but it doesn't let me.
If I run 'cat /proc/1/mem' as root, I get an ESRCH. Ditto trying to read
any other process. 
If, instead I run 'cat /proc/self/mem', I get EACCES if I'm root or a
non-root user.
If /proc/[nnn]/mem isn't the way to get this information, and it only 
gives errors, what good is it?
This seems true for both:
   Linux version 2.0.38 (root@qwe1) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) 
             #2 Thu Aug 26 16:35:52 EDT 1999
AND
   Linux version 2.2.16 (root@wilson) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000313 (Debian
             GNU/Linux)) #18 SMP Mon Jun 12 23:22:31 EDT 2000
Thanks..
Scott
