I'm having a problem with the usb-ohci module under the 2.4.18 kernel 
running on Cobalt Raq 550's - if the module is loaded then the machine 
doesn't reboot.  "shutdown -r now" shuts everything down as usual, the 
kernel displays "Restarting system." on the console, but then it just sits 
there.  If I rmmod the module before shutting down then it does exactly 
the same, but after the "Restarting system." message it does actually 
reboot.
Has anyone come across this before?  I really don't know what to look for 
in the ohci driver code that would prevent the system from rebooting, so 
any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
