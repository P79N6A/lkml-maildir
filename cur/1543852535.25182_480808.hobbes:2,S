now it is going to come down to how you measure this....
don't use hdparm, use something like tiobench (tiobench.sf.net);
another setting that might be different is that scsi normally turns the
write back cache off (safer for your data but slower) while IDE normally
leaves at at factory default (on for cheating on benchmarks).
For writes, this can easily explain the difference...
