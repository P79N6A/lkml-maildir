The select call seems to be asking for a timeout of 1 microsecond
and the difference between the gettimeofday() calls is 10000 microseconds
or 10 milliseconds or 1/100 of a second or 1 jiffie. Since the requested
timeout gets rounded up to the next jiffie this is as expected. It looks
like an application error. At least, it lost its marbles before this
point :-).
