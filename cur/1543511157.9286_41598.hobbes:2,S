Hi,
Using an Adaptec AHA-2940A Ultra SCSI with the same high i/o stuff
(e.g. creating a cdrom image (from one hd-disk to another one)) 
The system will slow down like a slow turtle. eg a xterm launch
will take about a 1/2 minute to get itselfs on the screen.
Sometimes it even seems like the system had crashed. (no response
from the mouse cursor etc)
And the systems response get worser when the copied files are
bigger. >100mb
Almost all 2.2.x seems to be affected (running 2.2.13pre14 at
this moment)
The logs reveals nothing what could indicate a problem. 
grt,
- Jasper
