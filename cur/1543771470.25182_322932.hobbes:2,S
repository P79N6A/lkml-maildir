Do we care? 99.9% of allocations are fronted by the hot/cold page cache
now anyway ... and yes, I realise that things popping in/out of that 
obviously aren't going into the "defrag" pool, but still, it should help.
I suppose all we're slowing down is higher order allocs anyway, which
is the uncommon case, but ... worth thinking about.
