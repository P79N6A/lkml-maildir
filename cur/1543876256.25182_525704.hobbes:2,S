Yes, that's what I started with.  It was only partially done, for example,
didn't have hpet done yet and didn't work well on my machine (hang
on boot).  As I dug at it, there was still more room for cleanups, etc.
Hence this, which has also been tested somewhat extensively as Jeremy
noted from my typo above...  Both NO_HZ=n _and_ NO_HZ=n ;-)
