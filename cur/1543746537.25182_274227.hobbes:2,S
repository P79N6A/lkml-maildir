Apache Cocoon uses so called generators to parse non-XML formats and produce a 
XML representation thereof. This XML can be addressed by XPath.
To store modifications back this XML needs to be serialized to the original
format. That's **very** fat and slow.
Maybe an automount with a special fuse filesystem could accomplish this.
For example:
# cd /etc/passwd/..metas/contents/
automounts /etc/passwd as "fuse-xpath-passwd" fs 
to /etc/passwd/..metas/contents/
Doing 'cat /etc/passwd/..metas/contents/shell[username = "joe"]' could work 
then.
Reiser4 would need a content-mount plugin that automounts
the respective file by means of a per file configureable
mount command. Something like
# cat /etc/passwd/..metas/plugins/content-mount
-t fuse-xpath-passwd -o ro
fuse-xpath-* filesystems would have to be written. These could be designed 
similiar to the apache cocoon approach of generators/serializers to
work with an intermediate XML representation of the file interior.
All the stuff besides mounting the fuse-xpath-fs's would happen in userspace.
I don't think that anyone can guarantee posix fs semantics by this approach.
