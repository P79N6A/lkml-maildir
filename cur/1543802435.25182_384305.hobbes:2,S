IIRC git-bisect just does an outright linearization of the whole tree  
anyways, which makes git-bisect work everywhere, even in the presence  
of difficult cross-merges.  On the other hand, if you are git- 
bisecting ACPI changes (perhaps due to some ACPI breakage), and ACPI  
has 10 pulls from mainline, you _also_ have to wade through the  
bisection of any other changes that occurred in mainline, even if  
they're totally irrelevant.  This is why it's useful to only pull  
mainline into your tree (EX: ACPI) when you functionally depend on  
changes there (as Linus so eloquently expounded upon).
Cheers,
