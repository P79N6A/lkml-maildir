Hi Ingo, 
Time is somehow more broken with -rt5 than with -rt4: 
europa:~# date --set="Tue Sep 13 10:57:00 CEST 2005"
Tue Sep 13 10:57:00 CEST 2005
europa:~# date
Thu Jan  1 01:03:49 CET 1970
Strange enough that KDE seems to have the time, although "date"
doesn't. Touching a file does also give it the "right" time. 
Running the hrttimers-support-dev tests shows several errors and
enabling preempt debugging features in the kernel config floods me with
preempt counts BUGs. 
Is there a known issue or should I try to reproduce the differences to
-rt4? 
Robert
