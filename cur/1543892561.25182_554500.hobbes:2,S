This is an atkbd only setting, right, so indeed it doesn't affect USB, right?
What I'm wondering if is there is any harm to setting softraw to 0, atleast 
until there is a better fix. With it set to 0, for ps/2 keyboards all the user 
addtionally needs todo is select the correct model, for which there are nice 
gui tools.
Add a usb-keyboard (which in reality is the linuxkeyboard) model to the mix, 
for the user to select / to make default even, and things will work for usb 
users to, right?

Thats good news, but what about gui tools to select the model, as this cannot 
be autoprobed? And what about portability of said tools to for example freebsd?
Using xkb models should work across different OS's, and is available now. All 
that is needed (for ps2 keyboards) is for the path of the special keys from the 
kernel to X-server to not change the codes.
