It needs to be split into piecees anyway.  The patch is a big mess and by
splitting it into smaller parts you can describe what each patch does,
maybe notice the problems with it yourself or at least give us a better
opportunity to review it properly.  Really, it is a lot of work but it will
pay off.

No.  The complaint is that the driver is an utteer mess.  It's basically
a badly written IRIX driver glued into a copy of the Linux serial driver
that doesn't even compile on 2.6.  Get real, and take a look at it..

Well, given that the ip27 is basically the same system architecture as 
sn2 we want to resuse that code.  Whether it stays in arch/ia64/ or goes
to drivers/xtalk is a different question.  Also note that you can just
make the IS_PIC calls evulate to 1 always in your build, any recent gcc
will optimize away the xbridge codepathes then

grep for __HAVE_NEW_SCHEDULER over your tree :)
