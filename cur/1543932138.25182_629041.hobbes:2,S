  I don't think this is right. udf_get_fileident() should take "unsigned
int *" as an offset, not just "int". This means changing struct
udf_fileident_bh to use unsigned int too but that is better anyway.
  And BTW the type shouldn't be uint32_t but really unsigned int in
udf_rename (int needn't have 32 bits on all archs (although I think it
has currently)).
