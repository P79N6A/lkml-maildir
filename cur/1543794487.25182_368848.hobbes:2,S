Hmm...
struct i2o_message {
        union {
                struct {
                        u8 version_offset;
                        u8 flags;
                        u16 size;
                        u32 target_tid:12;
                        u32 init_tid:12;
                        u32 function:8;
                        u32 icntxt;     /* initiator context */
                        u32 tcntxt;     /* transaction context */
                } s;
                u32 head[4];
        } u;
        /* List follows */
        u32 body[0];
};
is one hell of an endianness issue right fscking there.
