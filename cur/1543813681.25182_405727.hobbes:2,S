I suppose I wasn't entirely clear there. I'd like you to do the first
part (remove the card.c part), but not apply this second patch. I just
sent that in as a means of getting the ball rolling again.
The reason I'm pushing this issue is that Red Hat decided to drop all
magical scripts that figured out what modules to load and instead only
use the modalias attribute. They consider the right way to go is to get
the PNP layer to export modalias, so that's what I'm trying to do.
