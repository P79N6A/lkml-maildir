That's got nothing to do with CPU microcode.  It has to do with the fact that
the sound card and the CPU do no work when playing audio from a CD-ROM.  The
CD-ROM drive does all the work - it extracts the audio data from the CD,
converts it to analog, and pipes out a cable which plugs into your sound card.
All your sound card does is pipe out to your speakers.  In order to stop a CD,
you need to 1) stop the CD-ROM drive (reset the drive) or 2) mute the CD input
(reset the sound card).
