Hi Linus,
the s390 patch set keeps growing: 16 patches against bitkeeper of 2003/04/14.
This patch set includes a nice one: the removal (!!) of the s390x architecture
files. I hope this makes Christoph Hellwig happy who has been nagging us to
do so. In fact it was easier than I thought it would be. Arnd did some
Makefile magic that allowed us to remove one file after the other. This sped
up the process quite a bit.
Short descriptions:
1) s390 architecture changes and bug fixes. There is one fix that affects
   common code: invoke_softirq. For s390 we want to switch to the async.
   interrupt stack in local_bh_enable.
2) Add support for system call numbers > 255.
3) Common i/o layer changes.
4) Bug fixes for the sclp and 3215 console drivers.
5) Bug fixes for the ctc, lcs and iucv network drivers.
6) Make uni-processor kernels compile & work again.
7) Bug fixes & small improvements for the dasd driver. 
8) Coding style adaptions for the dasd driver. This patch is big but it
   doesn't do much. I removed outdated comments and most of the structure
   typedefs. No real code change in this one.
9) Part 2 of the dasd coding style adaptions.
10-16) The patches 10-16 belong together. They merge the s390x architecture
   bits into the s390 files. 31/64 bit is now a configuration option.
   The effect of this is that the files in include/asm-s390x and arch/s390x
   can be removed. If you apply the patches 10-16 please do so. I didn't
   want to send another huge patch just to remove the two directories.
blue skies,
  Martin.
