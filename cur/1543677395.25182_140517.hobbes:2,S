 Well <sirens heard> its verging on rude to send me an email thats
rude <people heard in background> and has this theme:
 You are a two year old, to learn what the words "quarks" mean you
should read Quantum Thoeries by Lazzengberg, then use a particle 
accelerator to Quantify and factualise it, OR
 Like asking a 6 year old where babies come from... Lets face 
it, how many 6 year olds can work out the full process without
a book expalining it, or someone telling them...
 Its verging on rude also to assume even though <Voices heard 
"PUT THE GUN DOWN, NOBODY HAS TO DIE"> <Hahns palms held outstretched>
nobody wants to read my question, that I would want to read such
an answer, so tell me <"NOW BRAVO TEAM, GO GO,"> why the rant by you? 
BRAVO TEAM GO GO! SUSPECT IS UNARMED. REPEAT. SUSPECT IS UNARMED.
 Chill. ;-)
 Lars.
