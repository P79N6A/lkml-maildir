For what it's worth, I was able to completely screw up my root FS
using redhat's Fisher beta kernel (2.2.18 + stuff).  I did this by
running a bad hdparm command while running a full GNOME desktop:
(This was not a good idea...and I know, and knew that...but....)
hdparm -X34 -d1 -u1 /dev/hda
(As found here: 
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2000/06/29/hdparm.html?page=2
HD is a 40GB 7200 RPM Western Digital drive. (ATA-100 I believe)
that I just got from Fry's a few days ago...
fdisk was sort of able to recover most of the file system by
booting off of the CD in rescue mode and running fsck on /dev/hda, but
many files were not what they said they were, ie /sbin/ifup was
some other binary...  Some files turned into directories it
seems....
Sorry for the lame bug report, but I'm scared to try it again, and
I didn't realize the complexity of the problem when I simply powered
down my machine with the HD light on solid...
Thanks,
Ben
