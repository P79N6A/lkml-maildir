This would only work if we sacrified the freedom to change something.
The kernel code base changes. A lot, actually. If it didn't, there eg.
wouldn't be suspend2whatever, because the API was plain missing back
in those days. So sacrifice evolution for backwards compatibility?
These days (and it has always been that way) kernel development is a
quite active process. If core-APIs need to be changed, the person who
does it usually also updates all users of the given API. That won't
work if the drivers are not in the codebase, no chance to grep for
something on 3rd vendor's websites...

Not everybody is using RedHar, SuSE, Debian or whatever. Consider I
was building a custom QBus-to-PCI bridge to use some ATI/NVidia
graphics board in my 15y old VAX. If my hardware hack required
broadening some in-kernel API, do you really think some guy at NVidia
(only to name an example:-) would cross-compile their stuff for a VAX?
Given a userbase of exactly _one_ person?

Usually, it's quite simple to buy correct hardware. Look for something
that's a tad more intelligent (SCSI scanners in favour of USB/parport,
postscript printers, ...) and offloads the host CPU.

The Linux kernel is a project (or hundreds actually) that have choosen
their way of operation. That's evolution with not a lot of
looking-back. If you want to have a stable API, heck, just prepare
another fork and implement it. If this is what users want, they'll
take it.

My (personal!) view is that Linux isn't actually about the users. It's
about the developers. Developers develop what they have a use for (or
become famous.) Sometimes, regular users can make good use of it, once
distributions prepared all the userland.
So if you're a developer, try to become famous for implementing a
stable API.
If you're a user, stop fighting against an operating system's kernel
and start looking for a system _you_ want to use. Maybe some WinXP
variant?
