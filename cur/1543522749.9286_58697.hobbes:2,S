I've compiled a new kernel, installed it with Linuxconf.
Root partition is /dev/hda5
When it boots it sais:
Partition check:
request-module[ide-disk]:Root fs not mounted
hda: driver not present
VFS: Cannot open root device 03:05
Kernel panic: VFS : Unable to mount root fs on 03:05
And it hangs. What's the problem?
