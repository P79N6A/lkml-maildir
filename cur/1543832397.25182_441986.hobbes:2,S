- drivers/ide vs. Alan's libata work
- usb-storage vs. ub
- oss vs. alsa
And for the old ones:
- pcmcia-cs vs. Linus' yenta code
- the old usb stuff vs. Linus' rewrite
And I've forgottem v4l1 vs. v4l2 too.

You're forgetting some inconvenient facts about alsa though:
- at least for a long while, they didn't care about compatibility
  between versions
- the interface is atrocious (shared library several orders of
  magnitude more complex than necessary, because KISS is not cool
  enough)
- the oss interface compatiblity has always been and still is
  considered a second class citizen
If the gpl-ification of the full OSS system had happened much earlier,
ALSA would have been crushed under its own weight by now.
  OG.
