I think that we don't need this complication:

Please don't do that... dprintk() is much more common. Also, then don't
comment dprintk() out below in the patch...

"All" we need to do is to update the "diff". Without dynamic ticks, if the
idle loop didn't get called each jiffy, it was a big hint that there was so
much activity in between, and if there is activity, there is most likely
also bus master activity, or at least more work to do, so interrupt activity
is likely. Therefore we assume there was bm_activity even if there was none.
Now, we do know the jiffy value when we started sleeping. If we use
ticks_elapsed(t1, t2), convert it to jiffies, and do
	diff = jiffies - (pr->power.bm_check_timestamp + last_sleep_jiffies);
it should work. I wrote a quick patch to do that, but it locked up my
notebook, so it is most likely broken; hopefully I'll find some time to debug
it, if somebody does it earlier, that'd be great, though.
Thanks,
	Dominik
Only assume busmaster activity on non-idle ticks if we didn't sleep until
that jiffy. Needed for dyn-idle.
