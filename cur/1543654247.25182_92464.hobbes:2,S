Hello all.
Sorry to bother everyone with what is probably a stupid user error, but in
case it's not I thought I should post my problem to the list.
I recently upgraded my motherboard to one with an ICH4 IDE controller.
Since it's not supported in 2.4.*, yet, I decided now would be a good time
to try the 2.5.* series.
I grabbed 2.5.49, configured a new kernel, built the kernel and modules.
Once done, I installed the modules (make modules_install), copied the
bzImage and System.map to /boot and rebooted into single user mode.
Everything seems fine except for one issue:  I can't load any modules.
depmod gives:
QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
insmod does the same.
Now, all my googling has turned up are a couple of other users who have
had the problem.  But, in those cases, it's a result of the kernel not
being compiled to support modules.  This is definatley not the case this
time.  Here are the pertinant lines of my .config file:
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y
# CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD is not set
CONFIG_KMOD=y
And, of course, my /lib/modules/2.5.49/kernel directory is full of all the
modules I compiled.
Any idea what the problem might be?  Is this a problem with the kernel or
a problem with the user?  If it's something stupid I'm doing, please
enlighten me.
BTW, this happens with both modutils from Mandrake 9.0 (2.4.19) and the
most recent version (2.4.22).
Thanks :-)
Adam
