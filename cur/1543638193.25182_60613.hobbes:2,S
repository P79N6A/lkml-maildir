Hello!
I recently tried the e100 driver and was happy that it reports
if there is a connection and speed and so on.
But should these informations not be reported through /proc-fs ?
I think this would make it easier for programs to monitor connection
status. We could even have a small red/green light in the KDE panel
to display connection status for different cards.
The point in fact is, looking into dmesg for connection status is definitly
wrong IMHO. It's neither a clean access nor easy to watch for applications.
So what do you think about /proc/net/<DEVNAME> support for status ?
As far as I can see this is partly implemented in /proc/net/wireless
or in /proc/net/dev.
Adding another column in the latter would do the job, too.
Anyways, just an idea.
Hope to hear your critics,
Nico
