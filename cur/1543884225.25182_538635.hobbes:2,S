Subject: [patch 01/10] compiler: define __attribute_unused__
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

For all supported versions of gcc (major version 3 and above), functions
and variables may be declared with __attribute__((unused)) to suppress
warnings if they are declared but unused.
This shouldn't be confused with functions being declared with
__attribute__((used)).  This specifies that the function code shall still
be emitted even if it appears to be unreferenced, normally used if
embedded in inline assembly.  For gcc 3.4 and later, unreferenced static
variables and functions are not emitted so this attribute is necessary to
force variables and functions to be output.  Earlier versions of gcc can
simply use __attribute__((unused)) to suppress warnings about such
variables: we do not require any special classification to ensure they are
emitted.
We introduce __attribute_unused__ for variables that should not produce a
compile warning if they can, due to preprocessor macros, go unreferenced.
