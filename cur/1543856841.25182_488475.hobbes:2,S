Don't worry. These compile into "do { } while (0)" (i.e. nothing) when 
CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set.

Linux always does preemptive multitasking of user tasks. These have 
nothing to do with CONFIG_PREEMPT.

preempt_count() is useful in !CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels too. It stores 
information about the current context (hardirq, softirq, ...).

I don't think that's the case.
