Well, this ain't OpenBSD.  They have a strict 6month release schedule,
so your type of development works just fine for them.  Linux has
something like a very relaxed 24month+ release "schedule", which is
far too long for some people.  As a result, the Linux "stable" kernel
is a lot less stable than the OpenBSD one.
But long release cycles also have their advantages and - most
important - they work with Linus.  So effectively, we all have to
accept them and deal with the consequenses.  I really understand and
partially share your doubts, but what does it help? ;)

speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
