Todays massive machines are tomorrows desktop. Weak comment, I know, but
it's happened before.

0.23% increase in size of bzImage, 0.21% increase in the size of vmlinux
and the major increase in code size is in one file, *one* file, all of
which does it's best to impact the flow of the well-understood code. We're
seeing bigger differences in performance than we are in the size of the
kernel. I'd understand if I was the first person to ever introduce
complexity to the VM.
If the size of the image for really small systems is the issue, what if I
say I'll add in another patch that optionally compiles away as much of
anti-defrag as possible without making the code a mess of #defines .  Are
we still going to hear "no, I don't like looking at this". The current
patch to compile it away deliberately choose the smallest part to take
away to restore the allocator to todays behavior.
