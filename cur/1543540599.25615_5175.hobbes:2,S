If one were seeing this race what would the effect be?
I'm seeing some strange stuff on my SMP machine when compiling large things
(like glibc).  For instance the make will stop with an error that a file isn't
there, but if I just type make again it progresses past this point.
But I've also had make segfault in part of the build, running make again will
pass that point just fine.
And worse, I've seen the machine oops (from the NMI watchdog) when trying to
build glibc.  Does anyone have any tip on getting an oops logged to disk so I
don't have to copy them by hand?
I dunno, this probally wasn't the problem.  I'm just grasping at straws until I
can get something a little more substantial.
I haven't ruled out hardware problems yet (I just powered this server up this
week).  Where can I get that VA program that catches computers on fire?  I can't
even remember the name of it.  I did run memtest86 on the machine and it passed
those tests.
