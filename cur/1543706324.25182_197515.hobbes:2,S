The penny drops...
I missed this code because I was looking for cable detection on
a drive-by-drive basis, and this is taking drives in pairs.
That's why the drive was being correctly initialised as a UDMA5
drive even though eighty_ninty_three() was returning zero.
The existing code was written before the ICH5 came out, and will
always work for ICH4 and older, but is wrong in its method of
detecting 80-core cables on an ICH5, and could fail if SATA and
PATA drives are mixed and used in compatability mode.  The bit
flags should be taken on a drive-by-drive basis, because the ICH5
is capable of logical mapping such as:
SATA0 -> IDE0 Master
SATA1 -> IDE0 Slave
PATA0 master -> IDE1 Master
PATA1 master -> IDE1 Slave
Note that this now sees two PATA drives on different physical
interfaces looking like master and slave on one interface.  In this
scenario, if PATA1 has a 40-core and PATA0 an 80-core or vise versa,
both would be detected as having 80-core with the existing code.
Why do I feel like I just pulled the lid off a can of worms?
The options are essentially that we:
1. Always force the SATA interfaces into native mode and PATA
   into native or normal mode (desirable - the compatability mode
   described above make only 2 PATA drives visible),
2. Modify the above code to work on a drive-by-drive basis instead
   of interface-by-interface (according to Intel, this is the
   correct answer),
3. Do nothing, and hope nobody notices.  :-)

I definately had CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB=n.
/proc/ide/hda/identify and /proc/ide/hda/model emailed.
(Apologies if messages don't thread properly.)
