I'm currently digging your code, some remarks:
 * The idea is good and doable.
 * We should impact ip_masq input path very low, because IS the 
    common path taken by every input packet.
 * Please #ifdef CONFIG_IP_MASQ_BIDI (or similar) for easier inclusion
    (there are MANY core changes)
 * Could you adapt your changes to patch below?
BTW I'm attaching a patch that provides 
  * double linked lists => fast deletion, neater code 
      Currently it depends on list "load" and MUST be fast 
      because it's called from timer.
  * dest+source hashing by  Julian Anastasov, improves port forwarding
      Currently portfw a-like hashing uses just masq port: same hash=> long list.
  * additional daddr-only hash (used by eg. John Hardin's masq VPN module)
Alan, Dave could you inject attached patch?  (tested Ok under heavy load)
Thanks
