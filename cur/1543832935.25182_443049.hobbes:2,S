Whichever, both cases trigger the deadlock.

Sure, well it's not very subtle. The below patch is what I'm using for 
now. I haven't seen problems with it yet but it hasn't been seriously 
tested.
I'm assuming that it's OK to keep holding the i_mutex during the call to 
direct_io_worker(), because in the DIO_LOCKING case, direct_io_worker() 
is called with the i_mutex held, and XFS touches i_mutex only in 
xfs_read() and xfs_write(), so opefully nothing will conflict.
