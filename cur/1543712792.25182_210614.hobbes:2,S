With acpi=off, I get a string of messages
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated to set 0, code 0x41 on 
isa0060/serio0)
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 41 <keycode>' to make it known
Then it freezes with HD light solid on.
Before the messages above ---
********* Please consider a BIOS update.
********* Disabling USB legacy in the BIOS may also help.
Disabled USB legacy in the BIOS, with acpi=off it's back to the original 
freeze after the found reiserfs message.
I shall check to see if there is a later BIOS available.
Acer 1501LCe laptop, Athlon64 3000+, CD-RW/DVD, fireiwre port,  no 
floppy, no serial ports.
Regards
Sid.
