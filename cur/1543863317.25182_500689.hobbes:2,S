The code does not check the page cache size but the number of free pages. 
The page cache size is available via zone_page_state(zone, NR_FILE_PAGES).
In its current form your patch is making the system reclaim earlier for 
page cache allocations. And its reclaiming regardless of the number of 
pages in the page cache. If there are no pagecache pages but only 
anonymous pages in the zone then the code will still reclaim although the 
page cache size is zero.
