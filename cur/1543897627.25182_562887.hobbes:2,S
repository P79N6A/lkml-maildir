(Except that in Linux, with SECURE_NOROOT=0, root will be able to.  With
SECURE_NOROOT=y it won't.)

Yes, thanks, but then it still could come in handy to have fE be a full
bitset, so the application gets some eff caps automatically, while
others it has to manually set...

Well no, it could also just be acknowledging that at some point some
better cap breakup should be attempted, though of course some amount of
"these caps can subvert that cap" will always be there.
But I'm not actually objecting  :)  I expect this will be the first of
the patches I whip up.

I used to do that (except with a stupid loop), but let's say you update
your distro, but the updated kernel has a problem.  So you boot into an
older kernel.  But the distro update added a new capability.  Now
nothing runs with privilege.
Or are you saying that we would name the xattrs
'security.capability.vN', and with each capability we add bump N, so
that after we've added 5 capabilities, each binary carries with it 5
xattrs, security.capability.v1 through security.capability.v5?

Well how about I whip up the patch (when time permits) and see if anyone
complains  :)
