OK, thanks, that helps.  From the diff of those dmesg:
-BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 16 devices found
+BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 6 devices found
So with the latest EDD patch noted above, it's finding more disks than
before.  How many disks do you actually have in the system?
I'll review the assembly again to see where I could have miscounted,
and see how that may affect the EDD sysfs exports.  Likely no answer
from me before tomorrow though.
Thanks,
Matt
