This is where the problem lies. The Kernel-HOWTO, the kernel config, etc
all say you should run make dep every time you compile a kernel. If, as
you suggest, this is not nessesary, then indeed it would be better to
recurse through the entire tree.

Mine were by actual measurement too, doing it multiple times using
'time' on each one.

Okay, here we go:
kleptog//usr/src/linux>grep CONFIG_MOD .config
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
kleptog//usr/src/linux>make dep | grep -i genksyms
kleptog//usr/src/linux>
Maybe this is because it's 2.2.0pre6 ??
I have always had CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on and never had a problem
with it (except that bug that's been there since 2.1.21).

If, as it says in the Kernel-HOWTO, you run make clean each time,
the kernel will build properly each time. Although I just noticed
that make menuconfig doesn't display that message anymore. Does this
mean make clean is not required either?
