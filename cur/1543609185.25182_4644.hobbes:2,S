   I played with that earlier in the year.  Shrinking the hash table
   by a factor of eight made no measurable difference to anything on
   a Pentium II.  The hash distribution was all over the place though.
   Lots of buckets with 1-2 pages, lots with 12-13.
What is the distribution when you don't shrink the hash
table?
Franks a lot,
