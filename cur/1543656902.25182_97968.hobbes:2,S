OK, that looks pretty sane - one question:

When does xapic_support differ from
(clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_XAPIC) ?
Do you want to use a physical flat xapic mode for your stuff, or the
same clustered physical mode as the Summit stuff? If the latter, then
the new switch seems unnecessary ....
