Teaching English is not my thing, but latent
means "dormant", which means doing nothing. So
the time it takes to perform a task is not
latency. Its the time it really takes compared to
the time it ought to take if there was no
overhead. If you have a perfect implementation
then you have no latency. Your definition implies
that there is no way to have zero latency, which
is just wrong.
I've seen computer dictionaries that define
latency as the time it takes to get a response.
That would mean a network switch's latency is
different with different sized packets, which is
just plain stupid. 
None of this is helpful, but since no one has
been able to tell me how to tune it to provide
absolute priority to the network stack I'll
assume it can't be done.
