Ok, I didn't want indeed to send this one _for merging_, even if I consider it 
correct and it indeed fixes the warnings; additionally, since HIGHMEM support 
is not very used (it's slow and less tested), there shouldn't be problems 
anyway.
Please keep it in -mm however, it should be ok and there it could get more 
exposure - and this is about interaction with the core kernel so it could get 
valid review from people outside UML.
Jeff, give a look to this one please. You need CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP and 
a futex user (for instance starting threaded apache inside the guest) to 
trigger the warnings.
