Yes, even France changed their policy on cryptograpgy, and if I remember
correctly the limit for France right now is 128 bits.  Which basically
makes it a non-issue for most normal use. 
That leaves the US as the only "civilized" country with outdated
cryptography laws. Sad. Right now the US is in the same esteemed company
as Russia, China and Iraq.
