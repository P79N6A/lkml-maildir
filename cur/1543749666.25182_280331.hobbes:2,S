Please, can't you just hold off on breaking the ieee1394 API at all for
now?  Currently there are no supported IEEE-1394 audio devices.  This is
a big deal as most new pro audio interfaces are IEEE-1394 devices.
There are a few under development, see 
http://freebob.sf.net
.  But they
don't work yet.  If you rip out half the API you will make it that much
harder for these developers, by requiring them to be kernel hackers as
well as driver writers.
How about waiting until there is _one_ IEEE-1394 audio driver in the
tree before breaking the API?
