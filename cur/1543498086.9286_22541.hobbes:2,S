this concerns me a little bit.  the AC patches are a way of testing new
and useful stuff as well as making certain bug fixes widely available.
however, the large fdset patch is still in the AC kernels, but not in the
mainstream kernels.  this means that any large site is stuck in a
quandary, should they need to run a kernel that supports large fdsets --
they need to run AC kernels, but AC kernels are not meant for production.
so:
1.  when can we expect the large fdset support in the mainstream kernel?
2.  if not soon, can the large fdset support be split into a separate
patch so that large production sites don't have to run potentially
dangerous kernels to get large fdset support?
