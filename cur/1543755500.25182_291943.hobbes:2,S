The few times I've used the via82xx on my mobo (ASUS KT400, forget the
model number), I've run into some applications that behave similarly.
I never got it randomly - it always happened when an app (ie, xmms)
would open the device and think it was in 44.1kHz when it was really
running at 48kHz.
I do music work on my box, so I've gotta stick with ALSA, but I've
found for common stuff the ALSA interfaces suck pretty bad - nothing
seems to know how to open the devices properly.  As a result, I mostly
use OSS emulation for non-music related things - Frank Barknecht has
info at 
http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
 on setting
this up.  Runing all my audio through that fixes the problem, since it
just resample everything to the running rate.
