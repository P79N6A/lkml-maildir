hi,
i tried a example code for character device driver.
the code got compiled but while loading the driver using insmod iam getting
unresolved symbol for register_chrdev_Rfxxxxxxx
i checked the /proc/ksyms
it contains a entry by name register_chrdev_R1xxxxxxx
and /usr/src/linux-2.4/kernel/ksyms.c
contains EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_chrdev)
how can this error be avoided or where is the error it likely .
thanks and warm regards
Shifani
