Actually "Pavel and frieds" are Pavel and _me_ and _I_ don't like what
you're saying here.

The _only_ thing we moved to the user space was the writing and reading
of the image.  [We moved it quite literally, by porting the analogous swsusp
code from the current -mm.]
Currently we are _not_ moving _anything_ to the user space.  We're just
_implementing_ some things in the user space, but _not_ from scratch.

Actually a lot of the code that we use _has_ _been_ tested and debugged,
because it _is_ used on a daily basis by many people, like eg.:
- MD5 from the coreutils package,
- libLZF (the original one)
(openSSL wil be used soon for the image encryption).
And I'm not trying to redo suspend2 in the user space.  Instead I'm trying
to use the code that's _already_ _available_ in the user space to obtain
the functionality that suspend2 implements in the kernel space.

The problem is to merge suspend2 we'd have to clean it up first and
actually solve some problems that it works around.  That, arguably,
would be more work than just implementing some _easy_ stuff
in the user space.
