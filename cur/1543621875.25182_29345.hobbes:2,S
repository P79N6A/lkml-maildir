Interesting opinion.

There are some factual errors in this statement:
The ia64 _architecture_ places no limit on how many instructions can
be issued at a time.  You could have an instruction group that's
thousands of instructions long which could all be executed in a single
cycle.  Of course, realistic CPUs will bound the number of
instructions that can be issued in parallel.  The Itanium and McKinley
_implementations_ of ia64 happen to issue up to 6 instructions at a
time, but other issue-widths are possible.
To the best of my knowledge, i860 had virtually no influence on ia64.
Cydrome's Cydra5 and Multiflow's TRACE did, as did PA-RISC.
