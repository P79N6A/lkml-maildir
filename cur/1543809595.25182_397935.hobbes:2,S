I have tried your patch.  The following is a part of syslog
output.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 16 23:52:40 moka kernel: receive_chars:flip full:low_latency=0
Feb 16 23:52:40 moka kernel: receive_chars:flip full:discard char

I have got this pair of two lines many times while running the
wget command.

With 'low_latency' option in 2.6.15 with your patch, the problem
did not occur and no output from syslog.

I have tried 2.6.16-rc3.  With or without 'low_latency' option,
the problem did not occur.  It seems to work fine!  I will use
2.6.16-rc3 or later.
If you have any additional plan to pin down this problem, I will
try your patch.
Thank you for your help,
