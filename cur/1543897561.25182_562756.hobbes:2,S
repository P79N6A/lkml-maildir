Why? A SUID programs runs under the UID of the owner, and should be no 
problems in it seeing the owners data.
But the patch post was more a quest for possible scenarios where the use 
of MAP_NOZERO can result in lower security WRT the same program (under the 
same security restrictions) not using such feature.
If you have something specific in mind, please go ahead and shoot.

I tried to look, and the attempt to reuse _mapcount failed miserably :)
The last time we have the owner info (vma->mm) available, is before 
processing of the other fields ends. OTOH I'm not VM guru either, so I may 
be wrong. It can share ->virtual (when enabled).
