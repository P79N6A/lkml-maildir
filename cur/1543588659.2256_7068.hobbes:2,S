But it's more people-friendly to have that trailing comma. It makes
adding new enumerations just slightly easier, and also makes it easier
to manually apply failed patches. I'd rather see those trailing commas
left in.

Yeah, that one's pretty ugly and unreadable.

Go ahead and make suggestions. I expect some things will be accepted,
some rejected (just like I did). Steer clear of any brace or tabbing
style changes, though.

Gcc is often too picky. It tries to be clever, but in many cases I've
found it's not clever enough. It's useful as a mechanism to identify
potential problems, but just because gcc whinges, doesn't mean there
is a problem. You'll need to read and analyse the code to be sure gcc
is correct in throwing a warning.
The goal should *not* be to shut up gcc. The goal should be to produce
more readable code and to fix bugs. Gcc is merely a tool. And a flawed
one, at that.
