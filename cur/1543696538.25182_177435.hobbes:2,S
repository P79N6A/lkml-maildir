If the page is used by AGP, then it won't have a mapping either.

Scanning physical memory is very dangerous: it's undefined what happens 
if a page is mapped multiple times with different cache settings. Athlon 
cpus prefetch whatever they see, and they speculatively set the dirty 
bit in cachelines for WB cacheable pages.

I think /dev/mem should lie and return 0x00 for pages that are not in 
the linear mapping.
Or /dev/mem users should expect random holes.
