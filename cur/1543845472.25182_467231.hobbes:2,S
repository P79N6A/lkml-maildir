True. Still you change the semantics.
	chip->mask();
	chip->ack();
is not equal to :
	if (!(desc->status & IRQ_DELAYED_DISABLE))
		irq_desc[irq].chip->mask(irq);

True, but we can not unconditionally change the semantics. 
Does it break existing or new code ?

Sorry, I did not think about the defaults in the first place. The
conditionals in manage,c are probably superflous leftovers from one of
the evolvement.
