Why duplicate the calculations?
Why not use the "TRUE" values as determined by the Kernel......
I remember you eating my shorts over this very point in the past when you
took me to school over the geometry issues!

Yes, and let the kernel dictate to USER-SPACE that which is kernel
knowledge..........

I agree, but you have to introduce new temperary code that gives current
correct reporting of data, before we do the steps below.

No, but you do write to the NV ram on the drive interface that does not
get changed even of if the power is cycled.
I am working with Quantum and Maxtor on the very issue........
Since I get demo drives........If I destroy a drive, I get a new one as a
replacement..........if a generic user NUKES a drive......they are out of
a few hundred bucks..........
18 months ago you and I bucked heads over the
"READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS" / "SET MAX ADDRESS" combination........
I was/still afraid of dropping this on the masses.........
That is why I designed the elaborate geometry mess to perform a FAKE call
of "READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS" / "SET MAX ADDRESS".........
We have already increased the reporting capacity of
"/proc/ide/idex/hdx/geometry" to allow for 137GB limit.
Prove to me against this change that reported kernel values should not
return the same........
Round 2: DING ;-)
