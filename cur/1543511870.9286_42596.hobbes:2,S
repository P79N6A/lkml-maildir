Go read IA-64 specs, it has all the functionality of IA-32 on it and you can
jump between those two worlds. The kernel I guess will just have to (or
already does, dunno what's the current IA64 development status)
translate syscall arguments and structures from 32bit to 64bit world like it
is done for agest on sparc64 in order to run 32bit sparc applications.
