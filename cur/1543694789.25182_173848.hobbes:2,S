After a few people pointed out an inconsistency in the bksvn gateway, I
rebuilt the 2.4 and 2.5/2.6 repo's. Anyone with those trees checked out
will need to kill them and do a fresh checkout. If you have changes
local in your repo, you can still do a diff to bring them over to the
new checkout, since diff uses local copies, and doesn't contact the
remote repo.
