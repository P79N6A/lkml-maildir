I don't know where you got the idea that Debian used to distribute the
kernel as it is.  Just like every other distribution, we have always
needed (mostly small) changes to the vanilla kernel.
We do send those changes suitable for general consumption to the
upstream maintainers.  Whether they are accepted is an entirely
different question.
