Alan tends to have much more experimental patches than I do - and we don't
sync up more often than maybe once a month or so. And even then, the
sync-up won't be complete, exactly because I don't take the experimental
parts (or more accurately, Alan mostly doesn't even try to send them to me
and we tend to agree pretty well on what is appropriate and what is not).
We're nearing another sync-point right now - I actually have a lot of
Alans patches in my mail-box, and -pre2 will probably contain a lot of the
-ac stuff. But don't expect a complete sync, as explained above.
