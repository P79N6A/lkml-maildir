Yes, please download the newest driver from D-Link, becuase the
Win98 will change to D3 mode after it boot.
So the Mac address can't be fetch in Linux.

I have the same effect when booting from windows98 to linux ( 2.4.3 up to 
2.4.5). The windowsdriver less the card in a unbalanced state so that the
card
lost his information of there own mac adress. We must plug off the
powercable,
after plugin an start into linux the dlink card works. I don愒 know what
kinds
of specific instruction in the windows driver, but when I only used this
cards
under linux, I doesn愒 have this problem.
