Inodes are not in any fscking directory. You are not on VMS. Learn the
bloody basics of UNIX filesystems _before_ playing with them. One more
time: Files  Are  Nameless.  Namespace  Is  A  Separate  Thing.  Name  Is
Just  A  Reference  To  File,  One  Of  Many  Possible.  Andrea, it's "F"
on UNIX 101. Links have no ownership, damnit.

... and F- on UNIX SA 101 - if you don't know the reasons to keep /tmp on
a separate filesystem. 
As for "kill his tasks" - great, is that what you do when you decide to rm
something? I like that policy, but it may be a bit of, erm, overkill.
Besides, why on the Earth do you have finite quota for _root_, in the
first place? It's an instant fsckup(tm) waiting to happen. Sheesh...
