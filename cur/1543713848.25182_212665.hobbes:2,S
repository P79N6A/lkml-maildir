Sharing is only an optimization that adds more code and potential 
for more bugs (hash tables, locking etc.). 
We can discuss changes when someone shows numbers that additional 
optimizations are needed. I haven't seen such numbers and I'm not convinced
sharing is even a good idea from a design standpoint.  For the first version 
I just aimed to get something working with straight forward code.
To put it all in perspective: a policy is 12 bytes on a 32bit machine
(assuming MAX_NUMNODES <= 32) and 16 bytes on a 64bit machine
(with MAX_NUMNODES <= 64)
