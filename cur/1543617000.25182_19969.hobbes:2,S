Hi Ingo,
 After adding H7 to 2.4.18pre3, I noticed that kernel compiles
on one of my test boxes got much slower.
Uniprocessor system (Cyrix 3) building a 2.4.18pre3 tree,
with the same .config, and a distclean before starting the compile.
2.4.18pre3        13.38s                       
2.4.18pre+H7      17.53s
I see similar slowdown when running H7 on 2.5 on this box.
regards,
Dave.
