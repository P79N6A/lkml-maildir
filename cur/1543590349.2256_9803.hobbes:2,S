Not cdda2wav, I pressume, but the optimization discussed here before that
wasn't really doable because of the vm behaviour when doing
	do 
		try to alloc some amount of contiogous pages
		if (ok)
			break
		lower number of pages wanted
	while true
CDROMREADAUDIO stopped doing this and fell back to single cdda frame
size allocations because of these failures, even though it meant a huge
decrease in speed. cdda2wav will ask for iirc 16 frames at the time, the
current driver will try and to 8 first and then fall back to slower
extraction if allocations fail.
