Hi, Marcelo,
The text below was taken from the following standard:
IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition
The Open Group Technical Standard
Base Sepcifications, Issue 6
Includes IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 1-2002
open()
O_NONBLOCK When opening a FIFO with O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY set:
 o If O_NONBLOCK is set, an open( ) for reading-only shall return without
   delay. An open( ) for writing-only shall return an error if no process
   currently has the file open for reading.
 o If O_NONBLOCK is clear, an open( ) for reading-only shall block the
   calling thread until a thread opens the file for writing. An open( ) for
   writing-only shall block the calling thread until a thread opens the file
   for reading.
When opening a block special or character special file that supports non-
blocking opens:
 o If O_NONBLOCK is set, the open( ) function shall return without blocking
   for the device to be ready or available. Subsequent behavior of the device
   is device-specific.
 o If O_NONBLOCK is clear, the open( ) function shall block the calling
   thread until the device is ready or available before returning.
 Otherwise, the behavior of O_NONBLOCK is unspecified.
read()
When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that supports
non-blocking reads and has no data currently available:
 o If O_NONBLOCK is set, read( ) shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].
 o If O_NONBLOCK is clear, read( ) shall block the calling thread until
   some data becomes available.
 o The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data
   available.
write()
When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a pipe or FIFO)
that supports non- blocking writes and cannot accept the data immediately:
  o If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, write( ) shall block the calling
    thread until the data can be accepted.
  o If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, write( ) shall not block the thread. If
    some data can be written without blocking the thread, write( ) shall
    write what it can and return the number of bytes written. Otherwise, it
    shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].
Thanks!
Jeff
