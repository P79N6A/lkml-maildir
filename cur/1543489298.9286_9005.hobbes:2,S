I'm not sure whether I understood what you meant :-| fdisk -b doesn't
work, and fdisk -l -b 2048 gives same results as -l only. Sorry for
being so stupid!! Finally, I am a little bit confused now, but with
mke2fs -b 2048 I get a 606 MB partition under 2.2.0-beta7 (which seems
to be ok), and under 2.2.2 some 200 MB, which I cannot mount under
2.2.0-beta7. Did you mean that? Heavens, I'm very ingnorant in those
things, but I thought "2048 byte/sector" on the MO disk label means
formatting with -b 2048, and I simply overlooked the sector/byte
information of fdisk, which suggest a different notion of
sector. Hmm. But I don't want to waste your time ... Many thanks for
you answer and everything ;-)
Bye,
Ulf
