Hello !
sorry for possible offtopic, but how can i turn on full duplex mode
in awe32/64 under kernel 2.2.x ?
pe:/# cat /dev/sndstat|grep DUPLEX
0: Sound Blaster 16 (4.16) (DUPLEX) - is it mean 'OK' ?
but:
pe:/# cat /dev/dsp >/dev/dsp
cat: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
where is a mistake? or maybe ALSA helps me?
please, reply off-list
Grisha
