I doubt that the forgeries are coming from the people behind
Seti@Home. I understand they are a reputable lot. My guess is some
crazed hanger-on cum groupie has lost all sense of perspective (not to
mention ethics).
Having been the victim of forgeries myself, I sympathise. I've still
got my nutcraker handy for the day I identify and catch the scum...
