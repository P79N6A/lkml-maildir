I split this into separate ext3/jbd and ext4/jbd2 patches.  It's generally
better to raise separate patches, please - the ext3 patches I'll merge
directly but the ext4 patches should go through (and be against) the ext4
devel tree.
I fixed lots of rejects against the already-pending changes to these
filesystems.
You forgot to remove the memsets in both start_this_handle()s.
