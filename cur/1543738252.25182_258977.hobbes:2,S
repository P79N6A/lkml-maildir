That worries me some, because the mid-layer will perform blocking I/O
and the like, and I'm not sure how much that stuff may depend on its
own usage (any?) of workqueues.  If you believe it to be safe,
then I'll nuke the kthread entirely.

Really?  I wonder why the mid-layer is so religious about
doing the lock around every invocation of it today?
But again, if we're sure that this is the case, then it certainly
make's life simpler in the driver.

The SG is tested for and simply failed -- there is no need today for
SG usage on those code paths.  If there turns out to be a need for that
interface with this driver in the future, we can add it.  Just like most
of the other drivers currently treat it.
What is the "kmap" semantic, and how should it be applied here?
Thanks
