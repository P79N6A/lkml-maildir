Wow, thats pretty awesome. Just the other day I said, "Why is hotplug written 
in sh? Isn't that horribly inefficient way of handling something that needs to 
be done quickly using the least amount of resources possible?" It seems you 
were reading my mind.
Please, continue this project and encourage distros to switch to it (when it 
exceeds hotplug in functionality and stability). Ubuntu currently is trying to 
reduce boot time, and I bet something like this would factor in (even a few 
seconds helps).
