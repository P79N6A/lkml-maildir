LS,
Well, the subject says it all. I just discovered that on my
2.2.7 and 2.2.8 machines /proc/1/mem no longer gives meaningfull
information:
	cat: /proc/5703/mem: No such process
Hmm, just noticed that even 2.0.32 gives the same error. I think
i'm barking on the wrong tree here? Is'nt this a catable file?
    Met vriendelijke groet,
        Pauline Middelink
