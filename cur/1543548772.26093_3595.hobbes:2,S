Specificate "*proper* buffering".
If your buffer is shorter than the size of the file (and as it's a buffer
it's intended to be shorter as your mp3 file can be several gigabytes
long), then at some point you'll have to page in from disk the new data to
refill the buffer.
What your proper buffering will do when linux doesn't complete the read
I/O to refill the buffer in time? (in time == before the buffer become
empty)
