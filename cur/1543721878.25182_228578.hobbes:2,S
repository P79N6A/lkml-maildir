Umm, they're not sensible. (You're mixing up word meanings.)
Log levels are not a big problem, because the log level is always printed
first. Usually.
IMHO, the stuff should make sense to a human reader, and it should be
possible to figure out quickly and unambiguously what the random bit
pattern that inadvertently got printed actually *is*.
That means: Escape anything <\x31 except \n. Escape \\. Escape anything
with the 8th bit set. Use hex escapes \x## -- let's face it, they're as
long as octal and easier to read these days.
