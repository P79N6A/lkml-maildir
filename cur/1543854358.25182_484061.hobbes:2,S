That would mean that in a multithreaded application (or multi-processes
sharing the same MAP_SHARED ringbuffer), all threads/processes will be
slowed down to wait for the slowest one.

I agree that kevent_get_events() is duplicative and we shouldn't need it. 
Better to concentrate all our development effort on the single and most
flexible means of delivery.
