how did you do that? You can't turn off overcommit on linux.

not surprisingly if you did what i think you did (ie echo 1 >

sorry, i've been abusing that term again. I mean it more as "finding
that we don't have the memory that we had hoped for because of
overcommit".
Running out of memory even when you've accounted for memory (eg older
no-overcommit/backing store OSs) is just a hardware issue in my book,
you can't avoid it, it's not interesting.
