correct. This should fix it:

It still doesn't cover the ram between the end of a node and the start
of the next node, but at least on alpha-wildfire there can be nothing
mapped there (it's reserved for "more dimm ram" slots) and it would be
even more costly to check if the address is in those intra-node holes.
The invalid pages now will start at phys addr 64G*8 that is the maximum
ram that linux can handle the the wildfire. if you mmap the intra-node
ram via /dev/mem you risk for troubles anyways because there's no dimm
there and probably the effect is undefined or unpredictable, it's just a
"mustn't do that", /dev/mem is a "root" thing so the above approch looks
fine to me.
