70% hit a bug
1/7th think it's deteriorating
1/4th think lkml response is inadequate
3/5ths think bugzilla response is inadequate
2/5ths think we have features-vs-stability wrong
2/3rds hit a bug.  Of those, 1/3rd remain unfixed
1/5th of users are presently impacted by a kernel bug
Happy with that?
