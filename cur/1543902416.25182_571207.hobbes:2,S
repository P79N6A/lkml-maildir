Isn't that the current code?

I just don't agree with you and with the locking bug fixed, you'll end
up with more code in the error path.

Sorry, not agreed on readability.  The rest doesn't really matter too
much and please stop making big deal out of this kind of stuff.  Things
like that do matter but not that much.  Mostly it's matter of getting
used to and there are many alternatives.  Some people like things one
way other people like another.  My taste might not be the best around
here but I don't think it's that awful either.  You may find my taste
disgusting but we all have to deal with such issue, don't we?
