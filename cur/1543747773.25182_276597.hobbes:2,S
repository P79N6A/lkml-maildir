Hi,
I am trying to use a realtek r8169 gigabit Ethernet levelone card as a link
between two machines that are cluster using openmosix, However whenever I
try to transfer large amounts of data after 5 secs the connections freezes.
I found a similar older post with an attacked patch to try, I tried it but
the problem remained. Any help ?
I don't want to upgrade kernel to something else as I need openmosix to keep
running.
Regards,
Nicholas Papadakos
