No need ;-).  You helped me pinpoint it... I went for it and ran manually:
bash-2.05b# echo "base=0xD0000000 size=0x4000000 type=write-combining" 
>| /proc/mtrr
bash-2.05b# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x40000000 (1024MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xd0000000 (3328MB), size=  64MB: write-combining, count=1
reg05: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size= 256MB: write-combining, count=1
Thanks for help Dave... very much appreciated.  I will look back and use Linux 
kernel module next build - I want things be nice and free too.
Nick
