I just got an HP9600 cdwriter (scsi, external).
No problem...
I made a CDROM and did a cmp against an ISO master...
then when I tried to read it on an IDE cdrom drive, I get:
hda: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
hda: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
I tried 3 different CD-ROM drives on 2 systems (one running redhat 7.1,
the other 6.2).
Same results.
So for grunts, I have a NEC SCSI CD changer...I put the one I wrote
in there...did the cmp...no problem...
(It also would be very, very useful if the error messages would
include the sectors in cdrom_decode_status).
I'm somewhat puzzled...
