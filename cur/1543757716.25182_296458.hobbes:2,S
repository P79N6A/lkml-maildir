Hi
I have a network driver which can have driver name as ethX. everytime i
used to enter eth1 or eth2  manually as driver name to enable/start my n/w
driver.
Is there any way that i could get the driver name at user lever other than
polling for it..??
Please reply to the mail addresses in CC.
Thanx in advance
Subbu
