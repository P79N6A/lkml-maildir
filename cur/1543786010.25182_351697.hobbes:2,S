Jeff Mahoney added file attributes to reiserfs3, you whined and pointed
people at the yet to be released reiserfs4. Someone fixed the 4K stack
on reiserfs3, you whined. Chris Mason added other fixes like
data=journal support to get some kind of journal feature parity with
ext3, you complained and ask it not to be added.

Perhaps you do. The kernel follows a coding style. It isn't my coding
style but like everyone else except you I try and follow it.
