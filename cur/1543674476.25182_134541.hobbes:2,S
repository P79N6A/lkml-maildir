I understand what you're saying, but I disagree.
See, I don't think the current interface is too ugly to live.
Especially since you don't need to introduce a new arg to implement
FUTEX_REQUEUE, so there's no immediate problem with it.
Do you understand what I'm saying?  If so, we can agree to disagree,
and it doesn't matter, because Linus will take your patch 8)
Cheers,
Rusty.
