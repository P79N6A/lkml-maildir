 These INTA-D PCI IRQs are always 'local to the card', their real meaning
 depends on which slot they are in. If you look at the daisy chaining diagram,
-a card in slot4, issuing INTA IRQ, it will end up as a signal on PIRQ2 of
+a card in slot4, issuing INTA IRQ, it will end up as a signal on PIRQ4 of
 the PCI chipset. Most cards issue INTA, this creates optimal distribution
 between the PIRQ lines. (distributing IRQ sources properly is not a
 necessity, PCI IRQs can be shared at will, but it's a good for performance
