The ramdisk is a known bug. To fix it I'll have to change some part of the
page-cache/buffer code. I just posted a patch which fix it but Linus
convinced me that for the coherency issue it's better to avoid shrinking
inodes with page-cache queued on them. So I'll have to redo the page-cache
patch removing the inode part and then I'll have to rewrite the inode
allocation using the slab.
