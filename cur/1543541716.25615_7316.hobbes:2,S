Update.  I got this working but for future reference to folks, the
kernel functions in_aton() and in_ntoa() if passed a '\n' or '\r'
character at the end of the IP address string, will totally garbage the
TCPIP address into 255.255.255.255 then attempt to connect, which
results in the tcp_v4 functions in-kernel malfunctioning.  If you pass
ip address strings as text in kernel mode, be certain to remove any
trailing '\r' or '\n' characters before calling in_aton() or you will
see sock->ops->connect() hang when attempting a SOCK_STREAM connection
operation.
This shows up on 2.2.17
:-)
