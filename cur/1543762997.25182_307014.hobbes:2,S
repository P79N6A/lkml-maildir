Sorry for posting the last email without a subject, I am just resending
this one with a subject.
I am fairly new to the mailing list but have been playing around with
kernels for awhile. I have successfully built 2.4 and 2.6 kernels on
different types of remote servers but this latest problem has me
stumped. The config I am using was working fine under 2.6.9 but 2.6.10
and 2.6.11 both are not able to boot up. I have posted the config at
http://eth0.us/?q=node/39
 if anybody is interested to look. On boot I
get the cannot mount /dev/sda3 every single time when trying with a
kernel above 2.6.9. 
I have tried with modules and without module support. 
The problem comes from the following SCSI card in a dell poweredge server:
SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 PCI-X
Fusion-MPT Dual Ultra320 SCSI (rev 07)
The driver that the 2.4 kernel uses is:
alias scsi_hostadapter mptscsih
Does anybody have any idea why this is happening or what can be done to
get it to boot? I have tried to compile it on a many different servers
with the same results. I have also asked a few people and they have not
been able to get it working. Any ideas or pointers in the right
direction are GREATLY appreciated! I have searched google but so far
have found nothing useful.
