We typically use proc for this, sometimes combined with an ioctl.  Some of 
these settings are standard in the kernel (bdflush, others) but more often 
you will have to apply a patch.

Linus doesn't seem to like like having tuning knobs appear where a better 
algorithm should be used instead.  Leaving the knobs out makes people work 
harder to come up with solutions that don't need them.
