Subject: [PATCH -rc2-mm2] BUG FIX - v4l broken hybrid dvb inclusion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/12/189

There was a change made in 2.6.13-rc2-mm2 within both of the following 
patches:
v4l-saa7134-hybrid-dvb.patch
v4l-cx88-update.patch
The specific change that caused this problem is:
- Let Kconfig decide whether to include frontend-specific code.
I had tested this change against 2.6.13-rc2-mm1, and it worked perfectly as expected, but it caused problems in today's 2.6.13-rc2-mm2 release.  For some reason, the symbols don't get set properly.  The following patch corrects this problem and restores previous behavior.  We will eventually have to remove these symbols alltogether when we find a better solution, but this will fix the bug until then.
Always include dvb frontend code for hybrid cx88 and saa7134 boards.
