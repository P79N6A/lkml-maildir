According to Rusty's unreliable guide
(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/kernel-locking/c214.html
)
if some code can be called from user context as well as in a softirq, at 
least spin_lock_bh() is necessary. I am not sure whether that may be 
true for the code that modifies files_lock.
