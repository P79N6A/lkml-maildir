Each platform needs different args, unfortunately.
Sparc needs the extra arg because the device space is described
with a base 32-bit address, then an upper 32-bit base to form
the full 64-bit address.  This upper 32-bit part is called the
"io_space" and thus is what gets passed into that 6-th argument.
