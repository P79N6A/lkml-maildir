Subject: [PATCH] QUOTA: Have <linux/quota.h> include <linux/rwsem.h> explicitly.

  Since quota.h declares a R/W semaphore, it should include rwsem.h
explicitly.

  No, this doesn't fix an *existing* problem, but it's necessary for
an upcoming patch which will remove all includes of <linux/rwsem.h>
from all the semaphore.h files.
  As I read it, since R/W semaphores have their own header file,
there's no rationale for the regular semaphore header files to have
that include statement, so any header file that's been happily picking
up the rwsem header file by accident (via semaphore.h) should be fixed
this way.
  quota.h appears to be the only file that has this issue building on
x86 with "make allyesconfig".
