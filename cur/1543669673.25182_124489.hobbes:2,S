Greg,
I've been thinking of how to solve this particular problem, and believe 
you could use dnotify in a daemon to track permission and ownership 
changes and store them in a backing database.  In fact, we do something 
similiar to this today.  This allows the user to use any type of 
application for changing permissions/owners, even syscalls directly 
without having to go "through" any sort of tracking database.
