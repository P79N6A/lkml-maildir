Excellent catch, Keith.  I missed this in my current implementation, and
will have to patch the exception tables in the init release callback.  I
also get around this because I allow archs to refuse to have separate
init and core sections if they want.
BTW, I just got ppc64 in-kernel relocations working.  I am starting on
ia64, in the theory that if you can do ia64, you can do anything.
Cheers,
Rusty.
