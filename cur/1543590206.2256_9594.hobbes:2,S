Yes, I have one. 2.4.3-ac6 (plus a few patches) detects the bug on boot up 
and enables the work around. Running the f00f test program from SGI results 
in the correct behaviour of a SIGILL signal being sent to the program.

Oh my, I always considered it as a cute, fluffy bunny. No need to 
bestialize it unnecessarily... (-;

Am compiling 2.4.5-pre1 with your patch (manually applied as parts of it 
were already in .5-pre1) right now. I will follow-up with results when it 
has finished and I have tested it (i.e. don't hold your breath, it might be 
a beast but it is a slow one...)
Best regards,
Anton
