Scott. How many times should I repeat: I am _not_ arguing against
waitfd.
But to clarify, neither I vote for it. I don't really care. Except
I do care about the code if it will be merged, that is why I entered
this thread.

This means I was confused. Because I thought you point is we can't poll
for childs without signalfd. And all I asked was: why do you think so.
I do understand that waitfd can be handy.

Yes, and that is why I mentioned that ppoll() alone is enough.

Unlike waitfd, there are things which we just can not do without signalfd,
even if we have ppol/pselect. For example: wait for the signal, but not
dequeue it.

Scott, I don't really understand why are you trying to explain this
all to me. I do understand this. At least I hope ;)
Yes this is possible, and I see no problems here.

Yes, and yes, and yes. Scott, I am sorry, I failed to read to the end
so perhaps I missed something ;)

I'd prefer to not discuss this here, but I am not sure I understand.
There should not be no threads which need the wakeup from here, and
I can't see how this change can help.

And now I don't understand you again. Please show me which races we
_can not_ solve in userspace without waitfd?
Yes we can race with the exiting childs while doing waitpid() in a loop,
so we can make the unnecessary syscall. But please do not tell me _this_
is the race we can't solve. This is _harmless_. Unlike the problems
with the poor user-space implementations of pselect/ppol.
Oleg.
