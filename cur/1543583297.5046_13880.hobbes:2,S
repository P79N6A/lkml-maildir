Hi!
Yesterday I've upgraded my 2.4.2 kernel to ac5, because loop-device
seems not to work in plain 2.4.2. But now my X-server crashes.
When I start with startx, X comes up, gnome starts, sawfish starts. Then
the system freezes. Even SysRQ-keys don't work.
I use XFree86 4.0.1 with nvidia-drivers 0.96.
I can't find anything about the crash in the logs, even the output from
X doesn't get written to disk.
Is this a known problem?
I'm going back to vanilla 2.4.2 for now. Is there another way to get
loop to work?
Bye,
Manfred
