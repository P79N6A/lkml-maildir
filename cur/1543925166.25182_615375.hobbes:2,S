Disclaimer: Havn't looked at the virtio code much.
I think we should keep the door open for both models and don't nail the
 virtio infrastructure to one of them.
For pure pv devices I don't see the point in trying to squeeze it into
the PCI model.  Also s390 has no PCI, so there effecticely is no way
around that, we must be able have some pure virtual bus like xenbus.
IMHO the PCI model is most useful for emulated devices with a optional
pv path.  Say the usual emulated piix3 IDE controller, give it an
additional pv mode, so the guest can drive it in pv mode if it knows
about it, and use the generic piix ide driver if it doesn't.  That kind
of devices we probably want identify by pci subsystem id.

Uhm, well, yea.  Guess you are refering to the pv-on-hvm drivers.  Been
there, dealt with it.  What exactly do you think is messy there?
IMHO the most messy thing is the boot problem.  hvm bios can't deal with
pv disks, so you can't boot with pv disks only.  "fixed" by having the
(boot) disk twice in the system, once via emulated ide, once as pv disk.
 Ouch.
Other than that I don't see major problems with the virtual bus model.

At least for any udev-based linux distro there is no need to rewrite any
guest os infrastructure.  Your virtual bus driver needs a proper uevent
callback, the virtual device drivers a module alias, and you are done.
udev autoloads your virtual device driver modules nicely, without any
distro tool hacking or config file writing ...
