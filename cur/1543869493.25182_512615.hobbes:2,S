Not so.
The thing is that the picture is of two pieces:
 - the executable
 - the unrelocatable lisp core (which is unrelocatable by the virtue
   of non-PIC code) which is mapped into the AS of the executable.
It is the latter which breaks, as its map can overlap with randomized
pieces of the executable (along with its libraries).
