Is anyone arguing that autoconfig is *unconditionally bad*?
As long as it doesn't impact the ability to continue setting things manually, I
don't see how it could be bad.
For instances where you're building a new kernel on the system it's going to run
on, and you want all the devices, then use autoconfig.  For anything else,
either start from scratch as usual or use autoconfig as a base to start from.
As long as we still have manual control if we want it, I don't see any problems.
