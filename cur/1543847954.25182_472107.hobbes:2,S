Ahh. 
Yes, now that you point to the actual code, that does look ugly.
I think it's related to the
	ClearPageError(page);
thing, and probably related to that function being rather old and having 
gone through several re-organizations. I suspect we used to fall through 
to the error handling code regardless of whether we did the read ourselves 
etc.
Are you saying that something like this would be preferable?
