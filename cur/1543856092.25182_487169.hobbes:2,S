Ladies and Gentlemen!
here is the first Linux-VServer version (testing)
with support for the *spaces (uts, ipc and vfs)
introduced in 2.6.19 ...
http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Experimental/patch-2.6.19-vs2.1.x-t1.diff
it might not be as perfect as the kernel itself *G*
but it does work fine here, and with recent tools
most virtualization features work as expected
please if you do testing, report issues or comments
to the Linux-VServer mailing list or to me directly
(at least CC would be fine) and do not bother the
nice kernel folks ...
enjoy,
Herbert
