BTW. By looking on your needs, the statistical branch tracer and the rcu stat one,
it looks like these tracers often (if not always) need several stat files, not only
one.
Actually what I should do with stat tracing is to build a directory inside
/debugfs/tracing devoted to the several stat output a tracer need.
Which means I have to make trace_stat.c completely reentrant and some other
things....plus the fact that multiple tracers should be enable to run concurrently
for 2.6.30... which means one directory of stat tracing for each running tracer.
