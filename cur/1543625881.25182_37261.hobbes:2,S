   Okay guys, new data on this issue.
	the kernel 2.4.17 which i used so far had this issue - ie the transfer rate drop
400k -> 20-30k without esd.
	i recently switched to 2.4.19-pre3 and the behaviour reverted:
now it drops 300k -> 50k due to esd active.
	i think both behaviours are broken, cause the 2.4.17 case clearly shows that
ne2k perfectly runs at full speed with _active_ esd.
	ie summarizing we have:
		2.4.17:		esd -> 20k bumps to 400k
		2.4.19p3:	esd -> 300k drops to 50k
