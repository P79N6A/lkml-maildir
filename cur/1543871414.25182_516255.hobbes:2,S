Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UDF cleanup and fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hello,
  the patches attached to six following emails implement some cleanup and
fixes in the UDF code. The main two fixes are:
  1) UDF now works correctly for files larger than 1GB.
  2) Deleting a directory updates number of links to the parent directory
     correctly.
See headers of following patches for details.
The patches sustained some torturing so I hope that I did not introduce
more bugs than I've fixed ;).  Andrew, could you please put the patches
into -mm kernels for testing?  Thanks.
