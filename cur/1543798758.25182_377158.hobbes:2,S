A little googling tells me that ENDECs are probably limited to
10 Mbps ethernet.  E.g., one ethernet controller spec says:
     Flexible IEEE 802.3 MII (10/100Mbps) and ENDEC 
    (10Mbps) Interfaces Allow Selection of PHY
ENDECs just convert from 8bit data to 10bit data on Transmit
(8b/10b) and from 10bit data to 8bit data on Receive.
Is ENDEC vs. MII selection a software config on your adapter
or a hardware config?
