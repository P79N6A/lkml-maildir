Ah. That explains it. You can't expect NFSv2 to work with any value of
rsize or wsize > 8k: it's a hard limit in the protocol. You'll
probably find that the server is running over some buffer limits and
hence corrupting the reply.
The support for > 8k wsize is really a preparation for NFSv3. I'll be
putting in the necessary checks and hard upper limits for rsize/wsize
later in the 2.3.x series.
