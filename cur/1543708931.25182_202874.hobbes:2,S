It's cleaner than your proposal below.  It's not so different from the
code that's there now.  And it does what that code _ought_ to do, namely, 
return a NULL pointer when the kobject is no longer available.

Since kobjects are allocated dynamically, you will have to allocate 
kobjectrefs dynamically as well.

Only until you deallocate the kobjectref.  And when you do, you then face
exactly the same set of problems: pointers to the kobjectref will become
stale.  If you don't ever deallocate kobjectrefs then you have a memory
leak.  So this proposal doesn't solve anything, it just adds an extra
layer of indirection.
