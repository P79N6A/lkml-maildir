I'll keep it in mind, sorry.

I see your point, and it makes sense, but I'm not sure I agree completely.
Maybe I'm traumatized by myterious rejects which happened to me before.
Looking at the patch with vi showed absolutely no clue why it failed.
BTW, here's one odd thing Gmane is doing:

The above is how I saw the Anton Vorontsov's message. The e-mail would
be corrupted no matter the charset, so that is bad. But what about the
copyright character? It's not Gmane's doing. The reason that not working
is this:

Anton took the UTF-8 text and sent it with wrong encoding. Such mismatch is
the most common problem in my experience, not conversions to HTML.
