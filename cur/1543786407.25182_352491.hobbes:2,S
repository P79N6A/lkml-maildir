Ok, this can be ok, but:

Sorry, but should it ever succeed inside spinlocks? I mean, should it ever 
call down() inside spinlocks? (We never do down_trylock, and ever if we did 
the x86 trick, that wouldn't make the whole thing safe at all - they still 
take the spinlock and potentially sleep. And it's legal only if no spinlock 
is held).
Even if spinlocks don't always trigger in_atomic() - which means that we'd 
need to have a better fix for this.
(Btw, I took the above reasoning from something said, as an aside, on LWN.net 
kernel page, about the FUTEX deadlock on mm->mmap_sem of ~ 2.6.8 - yes, it 
wasn't the full truth, but not totally dumb).

NACK, see above.
