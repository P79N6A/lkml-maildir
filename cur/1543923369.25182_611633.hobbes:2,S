If you are so anxious to review my patches can you please review them?
I'd love to see an acked-by or an actual bug found.
I only did what I always do when I am focusing on fixing a bug
in the stable kernel.  I fix the bug if I can with a simple obviously
correct patch and send that patch off to the maintainer.  Copying
other people that I know of who have a chance of reviewing the
patch.
