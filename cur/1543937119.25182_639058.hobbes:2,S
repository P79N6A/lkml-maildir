Hi Jan.
I will let Roman answer your question..
But one feature I really would like to see is named chocies so we can do stuff like:
choice X86_PROCESSOR
config GENERIC_PROCESSOR
	bool "A generic X86 processor"
endchoice
...
choice PPC_PROCESSOR
config GENERIC_PROCESSOR
	bool "A generic PowerPC processor
endchoice
The issue here is that we do not today allow the same config option
to appear if more than one choice.
This is a mandatory feature before we can do a Kconfig covering all architectures.
I guess there are other issues when we do:
if X86
source foo/bar/Kconfig
endif
if PPC
source foo/bar/Kconfig
endif
Where we in foo/bar/Kconfig has a choice list.
I just wanted to raise this now that you anyway are looking into choice
related issues.
