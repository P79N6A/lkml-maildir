Hi !
I just upgraded to kernel 2.3.15-pre3, and since I did the upgrade 
I found this error-log (as far as I can see now it occurs
immediately after hanging-up).
  Aug 24 09:39:23 elfie kernel: unregister_netdevice: 
  Old style device ppp0 leaked(refcnt=2). Wait for crash.
However, PPP is working properly and nothing seems to crash.
I'm using the ppp-2.3.9 package and the complete ppp-stuff in the kernel
is compiled as modules, and they are set up properly in conf.modules.
"lsmod" shows:
Module                  Size  Used by
ppp_deflate            40768   0  (autoclean)

Any suggestions ?
