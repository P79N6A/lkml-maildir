Hello, 
I've noticed something strange with issuing 'standby' to the system:
when echoing "standby" to /sys/power/state, nothing happens, not even a log or 
system activity to attempt standby mode.
However, trying echo "1" to /proc/acpi/sleep the system attempts to (standby) 
and aborts:
[4295945.236000] PM: Preparing system for suspend
[4295946.270000] Stopping tasks: 
=============================================================================|
[4295946.370000] Restarting tasks... done
We get no reason as to why it quickly aborts. 
[4294672.065000] ACPI: CPU0 (power states: C1[C1] C2[C2] C3[C3])
[4294676.827000] ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
What is '1' in /proc/acpi/sleep?  standby mode is not the same as suspend to 
ram? when I put a normal desktop in standby mode its still 'on' but the hard 
disk is put to sleep and the system runs in a lower power mode. 
Shawn.
