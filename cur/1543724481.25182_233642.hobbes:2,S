Subject: [2.6 patch] floppy.c: remove superfluous variable initialization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

One month ago, Kam Leo <A1tmblwd@netscape.net> sent this trivial patch 
with the following comment:
<--  snip  -->
Paul Slootman did not remove the superfluous variable 
initialization which masked the floppy minor bug in 
drivers/block/floppy.c.  Please add the patch below 
and close Bug 2770.
<--  snip  -->
Since this is obviously correct, the patch rediffed against 2.6.7-mm7 is 
below.
