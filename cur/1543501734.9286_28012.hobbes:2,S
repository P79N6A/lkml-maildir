You didn't enable DCBDEBUG, right? Otherwise you should have seen one more
message ...

This is in Waiting_process.
I also found this one. It only happens, when there is no device at SCSI ID
0. That's why I didn't find it in the first place.
In dc390_remove_dev, the DCB was kfree()d and one line below, a field of it
was used. Sorry, I could have seen it before.
2.0d14 should fix it.
