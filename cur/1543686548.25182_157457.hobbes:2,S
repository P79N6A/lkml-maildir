I'll quite happily do that. I'd assumed it was also rejected for bloat
reasons based on your previous objections that it was/should be entirely
a userspace issue.
If you'll take /dev/oprofile/pointer_size now, then I'm more than happy
to drop the kcore sniffing (and I don't have the a.out problem any more)
