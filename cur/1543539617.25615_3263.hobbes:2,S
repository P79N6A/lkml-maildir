Well, this is part of the solution. But, the other part is quite simple and I
believe being widely implemented in current Flash chips. They contain boot
block sectors that are *never* reprogrammed. Even if you have your Flash
reprogrammed with trash, when you reboot, the system still comes up and has
the *NONREPROGRAMMABLE* boot sector code--that actually facilitates the
reprogramming of the programmable memory sectors on the chip. It's that
simple. And all reprogrammable PROM, Flash, and SMROM *can* be designed to
implement this.
So all this *noise* about the kernel needing major changes is simply not
recognizing the reality that the hardware is defective. Newer systems are
now addressing these *hardware* flaws. The kernel need not take
responsibility for the inadequacy of the hardware industry's legacy systems.
The capabilities patch is about all that makes sense here.
