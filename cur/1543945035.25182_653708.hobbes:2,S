what you should realize is that had we applied your previous patch in a 
rush, it would have introduced a far more serious regression than the 
type of problem you are trying to solve. That's one of the reasons why 
we disagree with your sense of urgency.
We've got the clean fixes queued up and it's all under testing. (going 
fine so far)
Also, you only appear to have resent your fix with the obvious bug 
fixed, but it's still unclean and you do not seem to have replied to my 
main structural argument:
