I did, originally... And it worked in inode.c, but I couldn't get mkcramfs
to compile using those macros.  It's outside of __KERNEL__ so I tried
using __cpu_to_le32.  The following error occurred:
/tmp/ccoK4KS0.o: In function `write_superblock':
mkcramfs.c(.text+0xefc): undefined reference to `__fswab32'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
__fswab32 is defined in include/linux/byteorder/swab.h as:
extern __inline__ __const__ __u32 __fswab32(__u32 x)
{
	return __arch__swab32(x);
}
Can you shed some light on the error?  I used my own macros to get around
this issue and it worked, but the defined ones would be cleaner...
Thanks,
Brad Bozarth
