i have put up a version of the qlogicfc driver which supports IP for cards
based on the QLogic ISP2200 chip.  it is available from:
http://www.iol.unh.edu/consortiums/fc/linux/qlogic.html
in the "Experimental Versions" section.
so far im the only one that has tried this code out so it should be
considered fairly untested.  it seems to be running ok for me though.  id
appreciate any feedback from people who try it out.  obviously id like to
hear about any problems encountered but at this point id be interested
in hearing about it if you try it out and it seems to run fine as well
