Hi Julien,
this is obviously a bug, thanks for a fix, I queued it for upstream.
Two nitpicks:
- could you please submitpatches in standard conventions, so that they 
  could be applied directly using patch -p1 against toplevel of the kernel 
  tree (your patch was just against hid-core.c, but without any path)
- please inline patches in message and do not attach them, if possible
I will submit the patch to stable team.
Thanks,
