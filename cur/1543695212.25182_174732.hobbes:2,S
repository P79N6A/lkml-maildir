I can't compile udf filesystem support with 2.6-test8 (i compiled it in 
test6); this is what i get:
CC      fs/udf/super.o
fs/udf/super.c: In function `udf_parse_options':
fs/udf/super.c:327: `opt' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/udf/super.c:327: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
fs/udf/super.c:327: for each function it appears in.)
fs/udf/super.c:332: `val' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/udf/super.c:310: warning: unused variable `p'
fs/udf/super.c:311: warning: unused variable `option'
fs/udf/udf_i.h: At top level:
fs/udf/super.c:282: warning: `tokens' defined but not used
make[2]: *** [fs/udf/super.o] Error 1
I tried to compile it as a module and inside the kernel too. Please help me!
