Under some circumstances until `real' (usually timer) interrupt happens :-(
It is up to 10ms (on ia32).

Unfortunately both these ways needs intimate knowledge of how UP NMI
watchdog works in each kernel, and it is incompatible with other
perfctr uses. Probably I'll switch perfctr delivery to some real
maskable interrupt while VMware VM owns CPU - if it is possible.
Then interrupt should be still pending after VM does __sti().
