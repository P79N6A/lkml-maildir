You're in a mistake. For x86, there are no U-K syscalls for dmix and no 
extra U-U task switches, even the latency is same as for the direct 
hardware access, because we're using a lockless technique. Also, in case 
of use of using mutexes for other architectures, there is only task switch 
when mutex is locked when the real mixing is in progress (the mixing is 
really small time windows, so it's rare to have mutex locked).
In case of a mixing daemon, you need to regulary woke up a task in a time 
period (probably with a highter time interval than application are feeding 
new samples). So you have at least one U-U task switch in the perfect 
conditions (all sound applications delivered data "in time").
