And probably oops.  Doesn't X disassociate itself from the tty,
so current->tty could well be NULL.  Also, Who's to say that
"current" is the X server?
Note also that this will write in "text" mode onto a graphics
mode framebuffer, which won't be very visible.
Probably the best way of seeing the kernel messages is to either
use a serial console, or failing that kill klogd and use
cat /proc/kmsg to display them in an xterm.
