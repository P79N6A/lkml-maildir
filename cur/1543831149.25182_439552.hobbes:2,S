nope. but from the docs available i would _guess_ this thing is really
similar to the 82443BX/82371AB combination. at least the SMBus base address
register is hidden at the very same place (32bit at 0x90 in function 3 of the
"south" brigde)...so the attached little patch might be enough to fix things...
Alessio, could you try that one on top of a kernel that shows the problem?
