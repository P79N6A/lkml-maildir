I can think of at least 2 different ways (there are probably more):
	- look at the device in /proc/bus/usb/devices and wait until the
	  driver is bound to that device "(hid)" will show up as the
	  driver bound to that interface
	- look at the sysfs directory for the hid driver and wait for
	  the symlink to the device shows up.  This should be at
	  /sys/bus/usb/drivers/hid
Hope this helps,
