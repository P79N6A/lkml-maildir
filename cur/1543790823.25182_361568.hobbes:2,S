It seems a not unreasonable assumption that 2.6.13 works okay, or
there would have been reports of unhappiness (though that is a pure
assumption). Since it only takes a few hours to get the problem to
occur, is it feasible to try to bisect the problem space by testing
some snapshots between 2.6.13 and 2.6.14?
