hm.  I can see that access_process_vm() is doing lock_page() inside
mmap_sem, which is a ranking bug, but it's not that.
And I see a distinct lack of flush_foo_page() calls after the by-hand
modification of the user page.  But it's not that either.
Can you work out who is holding mmap_sem for writing?
