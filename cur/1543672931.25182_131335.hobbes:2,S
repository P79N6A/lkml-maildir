uh? you just need to fxsave on stack, extract the mask, the struct
is 512 bytes length, surely during kernel init 512 bytes stack
allocation is right

Such system are not symetric. I don't think we must take care
about this theorical things and I'm pretty sure than mixing old
P4 and newers in a box can't work. Anyway even if it works
userspace program using DAZ will be not reliable since they can
run from time to time on cpu with DAZ then cpu w/o DAZ.
