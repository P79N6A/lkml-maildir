Yes, namespaces would be better - just as the file system isolation was
moved from a "strong chroot" approach to using pivot-root.  Though note
that vserver still uses basically the method that bsdjail uses, and my
two attempts at getting network namespaces considered in the kernel so
far were dismal failures.  Hopefully this time we've got some better,
more network-savvy minds on the task  :)
