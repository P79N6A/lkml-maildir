First, I don't understand how as you say, "suggestions are
desperately needed" on a developmental kernel. These things are
not known to work on all configurations and some information like
"It gives me hex codes..." is worthless. Please write down
these "hex-codes" and, after booting a version the works, run them
through ksymoops. If you don't know what that is:
The latest version can be found in
ftp://ftp
.<country>.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops together
with patches to other utilities in order to give more accurate Oops
debugging.
FYI, after you run the text through ksymoops, you may find that it
occurs in a module that you really don't need to load at boot time.
Just remove that from initrd and try again.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
