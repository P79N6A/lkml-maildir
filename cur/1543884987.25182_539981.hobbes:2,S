Hi Eric,
	Lack of in-tree code is definitely not due to me.  The code which uses

Then put the patch is -mm, behind lguest.  Or better, help me refine my
patches and I'll happily do it for you.
Of course, I expect that Andrew is about to push my patches to Linus....
any day now... right Andrew?  Then we don't need this argument.
Rusty.
