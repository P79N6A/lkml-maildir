Nothing is "impossible".  Cracking SHA-256 isn't "impossible", it just 
takes more computing power than exists on the face of the planet.
Call it "infeasable" if you like.  It's theoretically possible, but the 
amount of work and the overhead involved just are not realistic.  And 
then you have the likelihood of a bug in the bookkeeping code leading to 
runtime corruption...  Better to take the hit now and fix the original 
problem.
