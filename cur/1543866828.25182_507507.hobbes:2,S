Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

local_t : adding and standardising local atomic primitives
These patches extend and standardise local_t operations on each architectures,
allowing a rich set of atomic operations to be done on per-cpu data with
minimal performance impact. On architectures where there seems to be no
difference between the SMP and UP operation (same memory barriers, same
LOCKing), local.h simply includes asm-generic/local.h, which removes duplicated
code from the current kernel tree.
These patches apply on 2.6.20.
It depends on the patch "atomic.h : standardising atomic primitives"
These patches compile fine against :
arm
i686
ia64
m68k
mips
mipsel
x86_64
ppc 405
powerpc 970
s390
sparc
sparc64
