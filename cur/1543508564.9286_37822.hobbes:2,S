Great;  thanks!
How about 
#define MAX_MAP_COUNT	(65536)
in sched.h ?
I don't understand why this is being checked against, and it also turns out to 
be the cause of why my >2GB virtual memory process cannot grow unexpectedly.
How about getting rid of it?

Is the above correct given that /usr/include/resourcebits.h still defines
struct rlimit {  long int rlim_cur;  long int rlim_max; }  ?
