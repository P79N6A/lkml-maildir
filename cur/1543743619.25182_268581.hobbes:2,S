Okay, so I made a fool of myself, hope you had fun, sorry for the
inconvenience otherwise :-)
  Seriously though, and as much as I know I should have read the docs,
is this detectable from meye?  If it is, I suggest it would be a nice
thing to have a different or more explicit error message.  Just "meye:
need to reset HIC, is sonypi correctly configured?" would be cool.
Roland.
