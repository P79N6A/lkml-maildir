I think that we are seeing different manifestations of apt's response
to corrupted cache files. There does not appear to be any pattern to
which manifestation occurs. Maybe it depends on where in the cache
file the corruption is located, i.e. when the corruption occurs. Based
on the kernel gurus current knowledge of the problem, would you expect
the corruption to occur at the same point in a file, or is it possible
that the corruption could occur at different points on successive
Debian installer attempts on a UP, non PREEMPT system ?
