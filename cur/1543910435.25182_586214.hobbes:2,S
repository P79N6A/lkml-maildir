Yep, that should work.  You can drop the loop though.  You can't
register a boot console if another console exists, and the first
non-boot console replaces the boot console, thus you never ever have
more than one console in case the boot console is still active.
The printk should be all lowercase like the other printk's in the file.
Other than that it loosk fine.
cheers,
