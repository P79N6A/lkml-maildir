Hi,
I have got a block device which I would like to mount twice using different 
filesystems. The two filesystems support this (are already patched), but 
through the function thread of mounting comes open_bdev_excl() which makes 
it impossible to do said mounts.
Can anyone give me a hint on what to change to disable bdev exclusive locking 
for a given condition? Thanks.
