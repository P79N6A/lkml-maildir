Okay, I got it working with the exact method that sd.c uses. I've put
a few printk's in to see where it fails a mode sense. It's actually
inconsistent:
	a) insert a writable disc first after boot, method 1 works
	b) then insert a non-writable disc once - suddenly method 1
	   stops working, even on writable discs, instead method 2
	   works
	c) insert a non-writable disc first after boot, method 1
	   never works, but method 2 does
There's a third method in sd.c. I've also left that in since I suspect
it might be necessary under some circumstances, too.
From my testing, I get the impression that this Fujitsu drive only
has mode page 0, meaning that only 0x00 and 0x3F make sense, and that
mode page 0x00 also only contains very few bytes of information -
because asking for 16 bytes from 0x3F didn't work, but 4 bytes does.
What's weird is that asking for all pages can also stop suddenly, after
which only page 0x00 is accessible. And when that happens, we only get
a meaningless request sense of 00/00/00 back.
Oh well, strange hardware indeed.
Here's the patch that works for me, please consider applying and
pushing to Linus/Andrew:
