Nobody would test it in interesting ways.
We'd get more testing in linux-next, but still not enough, and not of
the right type.
It would be better to just make the desision, merge it and forge ahead.
Me, I'd be 100% behind the idea if it had a credible prospect of a net
reduction in the number of slab allocator implementations.
I guess the naming convention will limit us to 26 of them.  Fortunate
indeed that the kernel isn't written in cyrillic!
