Sorry for the late response. I indeed try to maintain the watchdog drivers
and get a uniform API for all the watchdog drivers.

the actual problem you have is not the magic char 'V' that needs to be
written to safely stop the watchdog. The problem is that your watchdog
can not be stopped once started.
What we should do (in my opinion) is to add a timer like done in
mixcomwd.c. What this timer does is ping/tickle the watchdog internally
when the watchdog is supposed to be not active. (So it starts pinging
the watchdog after userspace stopped/released /dev/watchdog and it stops
again when the userspace opens /dev/atchdog again).
The writing of the magic char V is a failsafe mechanism for if the 
watchdog daemon would crash and close /dev/watchdog when it is supposed
to keep working...
Greetings,
Wim.
