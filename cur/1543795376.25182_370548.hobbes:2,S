Sure. But I suspect that nobody else has that file open when you do so?
In other words, even your usage is something where the OS could tell that 
you don't actually need atomic operations. It certainly gets slightly more 
complicated (we'd need to trigger some special stuff if another process 
does an mmap on it), but it's not conceptually very difficult to just 
notice automatically and do the right thing(tm).
Now, if two programs are using mmap() to write to the same file at the 
same time, then the kernel can't tell any more. But in that case, you 
probably _do_ want atomic ops to be guaranteed, so not disabling them is 
the right thing to do there.
