Why is that done so complicated?
Why not just copy the struct over?
When the kernel generates the signal, I hope the mem is zeroed
and we copy it to user. When a user sends a signal, you want to
prevent sending of arbitrary data? Why is that not done where
the permission check happens?
What do I miss?
