disagree, if the kernel doesn't provide a lowlatency elevator of some
sort there's no way to workaround it in userspace with just a
partial-mem buffer (unless you do [1])

having an huge buffering introduces the 8m latency during startup
Which is very annoying if the machine is under high load (especially if
you want to apply realtime effects to the audio, ever tried the xmms
equalizer with an 8m buffer? and it still doesn't guarantee that 8megs
are enough.  secondly 8mbytes mlocked are quite a lot for a 128m
destkop. third, applications are just doing what you suggest and still
you can hear seldom skips during heavy I/O i.e.  having buffering is not
enough if the elevator only cares about global throughput or if the
queue is very huge (and incidentally you're not using SFQ/CFQ).  It is
also possible you don't know what you want to read until the last
minute.
[1] Along your lines you can also buy some giga of ram and copy the
whole multimedia data in ramfs before playback ;) I mean, I agree it's a
problem that can be solved by throwing money into the hardware.

the main issue that matters here is not the vm but the blkdev layer
and there you never know if the I/O was submitted by an RT task or not.
and btw the right design for such app is really to use async-io not to
fork off a worthless thread for the I/O.
