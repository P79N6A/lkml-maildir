could you elaborate those many places that execute page_mapping while
the other cpu does page_add_rmap or page_remove_rmap?
If the VM does a page_mapping in the pagecache layer in my tree, that
means we already executed page_add_rmap long before calling
__add_to_page_cache, the __add_to_page_cache/__remove_from_page_cache
spinlocks are enough to serialize PageAnon. That covers sync_page and
the rest of the pagecache layer.
There's just one place that I'm wondering about and it's page_mapping in
memory.c but it only changes a mark_page_accessed so I don't see any
trouble whatever happens there (mark_page_accessed can be run on any
random page anytime and it cannot do any harm). I believe we can live
with that race just fine, it's controlled by mark_page_accessed
internally by checking PageLru inside the zone->lru_lock.
Please elaborate which is the place that can run at the same time of
page_add_rmap/page_remove_rmap (I mean of the _first_ or _last_
page_add_rmap/page_remove_rmap, the ones that are allowed toggle the
PageAnon bitflag, all the nested ones are harmless).
