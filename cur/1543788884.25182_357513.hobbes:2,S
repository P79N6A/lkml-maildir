Once a process in in the 'Z' state it should not receive any
signals. Its signal handlers are already gone. It's just a
snippit of sys_exit code that remains. If the process truly
is in the 'Z' state, its input/output/error file-descriptors
should have already been closed so the time-out from the
shutdown should have already happened.
