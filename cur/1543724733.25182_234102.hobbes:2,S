Would you mind adding a prefix that makes it clear what this changeset 
entry is actually referring to?  My recommendation would be "[CIFS] ".
The casual changelog or bk-commits-head reader has no idea that this 
change (and similar cifs changes from you) is related to CIFS without 
opening the message or extracting the changeset -- which defeats the 
purpose of the changelog/email subject.
