Uh, I tried something like this.  The flaw is that the count
is a count of used slots at in that node and does not say
anything about slots in any nodes below that one.  In my
tree the bit map is an indication of empty leaf node slots. 
This means that when a leaf slot becomes free it needs to be
reflected in each node in the path to that leaf and when a
leaf node fills, that also needs to be reflected in each
node in the path.

Hm, the question becomes: 
a.)Should I add code to the radix-tree to make it do what I
need and, most likely take longer and be harder to debug, or
b.)Should I just enhance what I have to remove the
recursion, which should be rather easy to do and test, even
in kernel land?
