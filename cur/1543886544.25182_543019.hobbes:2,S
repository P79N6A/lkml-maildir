Xen is not mandatory as it now stands. Also, I intend to fix up Xen
at some point so it doesn't need this.

The suggestion was to keep cached preconstructed pgd's on a list for
pageattr.c to traverse instead of the mmlist. The quicklist code
retains that list (in fact, even for the PAE shared kernel pmd case
where it's not necessary) despite it being a different allocator, so
manfred's suggestion remains implemented.
The alternative was 64-bit generation numbers incremented at the time
of change_page_attr(). If generation numbers were used, it would be
possible to dispose of the list altogether. Given the awkwardness of
the list maintenance for Xen, it may be worth using them now. PAE
pgd's could merely double in size to maintain those for the unshared
kernel pmd case, and remain 32B otherwise. Full PAGE_SIZE -sized pgd's
for 2-level pagetables could distribute the generation number across
page->index and page->private, or any other fields available.
