Changes:
- new 64bit types in linux/types.h are now properly ifdefed, so they don't 
generate errors when using -ansi flag
- in previous release I've missed some defines from linux/compiler.h which 
resulted in some files being broken. Fixed.
Bugfix release, upgrade recommended.
ChangeLog is still missing, but I'll be moving to subversion which should 
resolve this issue.
And my scripts that automatically check new releases for broken headers will 
use -ansi flag from now on, so these types of bugs should not happen anymore.
Enjoy.
