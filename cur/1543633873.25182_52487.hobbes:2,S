gang_cpu is not quite ready to post, but work is happening on it
and it's happening today -- I have a suitable target in hand and 
am preparing it for testing. The bits written thus far consist of
a transparent per-cpu pool layer refilled using the gang transfer
mechanism, and I'm in the process of refining that to non-prototypical
code and extending it with appropriate deadlock avoidance so explicit
gang allocation requests can be satisfied.
Cheers,
Bill
