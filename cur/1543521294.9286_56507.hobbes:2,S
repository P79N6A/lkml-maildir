Subject: make xconfig and choice bug?

Hi, 
while playing with reiserfs, I found out that:
make xconfig does not choose any of the options of a "choice"
selection for a new option, while make menuconfig does and make
oldconfig/make config ask anyways for new options. 
This is the relevant Config.in fragment. I expect make xconfig to set
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SECURE_HASH unless explicitly touched (yes, REISERFS is
set).
#reiserfs support
tristate 'Reiserfs support' CONFIG_REISERFS_FS
if [ "$CONFIG_REISERFS_FS" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_REISERFS_FS" = "m" ]; then 
    choice 'Reiserfs hash function' \
           "...tea_hash  CONFIG_CRYPTO_SECURE_HASH \
            ...rupasov_hash  CONFIG_YRH_HASH" ...tea_hash     
fi
Comments, Fixes? (I cannot currently program Tcl/Tk).
