I talked to a genuine authentic lawyer[1] about the GPL v BSD stuff a few
years ago:   [1] non internet ..
o	GPL + BSD without advertising clause appears to be completely
	ok. Ditto the XFree86 one
o	GPL + BSD with advertising clause is not compatible and the 
	advertising clause is clearly an 'additional restriction'
In general GPL + anything is a no go unless the 'anything' is extremely non
restrictive. The GPL draws an arbitary line and labels one side free they
other not.
Since UC Berkeley dropped the advertising clause from their parts of the code
its possible this problem has actually vanished by default in the kernel case
now. I've not checked the documentation to figure this out.
