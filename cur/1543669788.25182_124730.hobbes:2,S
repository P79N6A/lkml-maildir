On a system that's been set up with one large root partition, and
nothing else, you might get a noticable gain, but I would guess that
you could get a simliar gain by partitioning the disk and manually
placing, E.G. /var near the outside of the disk, and things like /etc
near the centre.  I.E. placing more active partitions on faster areas
of the disk.

Not really - there are still a lot of advantages of SCSI that it
wouldn't address.
