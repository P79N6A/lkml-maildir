Okay then, the bug still stands, but you want a different fix really.
The user that reported it to me was infact setting multiple bit
combos, which you indicate as taboo (but currently allowed). So 
when multiple bit combos are given, we can either do:
a) return -EINVAL if more than ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT is set
b) clear/ignore any bits above and beyond ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT.
As you are a time guru, please indicate which is preferable and I will
bounce Rusty an appropriate patch.
Thanks,
Paul.
