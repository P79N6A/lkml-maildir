We agree on this, I have no opposition to NTFS checking  size of files 
used to store EAs and rejecting any write more than 64k

Inheriting stat data from the parent directory should be a feature 
available not just for streams, but for all files that want it. 
 Efficient small file access to a 32 byte file should be a feature 
available to all files, not just EAs.  Not being listed in readdir 
should be a feature available to all files, not just EAs.  Constraining 
what is written to them should be a feature available to all files, not 
just EAs, and arbitrary plugin based constraints should be possible.
Is this more clear?
