You should not have changed the contents of your makefile but just
passed it some parameters.

It is because you have changed HOSTCC which is the compiler for the
host you're building from. Normally, you just have to do something
like this :
$ make ARCH=ia64 CC=ia64-gcc menuconfig vmlinux ...
And BTW, don't build as root, one day you will regret it.
