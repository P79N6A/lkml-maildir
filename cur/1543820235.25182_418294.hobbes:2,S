The above two anomalies are due to the git tree also containing the DLM
(already in -mm) and I forgot to redo this patch which is the only one
which overlaps with the DLM code. I expect that Andrew Morton will
update the version of the DLM in -mm at the same time as taking GFS2
when it is deemed ready to go in.

This has been resolved by removing the dependency completely.

I will check this with the DLM developers and see what the best solution
is. Thanks for the feedback,
Steve.
