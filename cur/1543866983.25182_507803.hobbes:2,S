Yes, that call ends up about 10MB/sec faster for 100 1mb file transfers
over 1gbit network (78 MB/s vs 66-72 MB/s over 1 Gb network, sendfile sending server 
is one-way AMD Athlong 64 3500+), but indeed, it can be the case that async IO sending 
was main speed factor.
I added header by request from Suparna Bhattacharya - my main position
is the same about syscall overhead, but I do not that care.
