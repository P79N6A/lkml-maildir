Yep. It's fine. Memory that's not used is wasted. Therefore anything
that is "spare" is used for buffers, usually to cache the file-system
to make your hard-disk run as fast as a RAM disk.
When your task needs memory, the kernel will give some of it to you,
but not before you actually need it. That's the way virtual memory
systems work.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
