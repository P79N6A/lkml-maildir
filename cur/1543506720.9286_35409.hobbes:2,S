Hmm... It shouldn't reply to ARP-s on the same interface according to
my experience. Are you sure you have your routing table set properly?
I'm using this method to give my test machine that's routed via my
workstation a valid IP address from the department's class C range.
I also used it at various places, seeing this problem only when the
institute's sysadmins changed the network topology without notifying
me to change my routing table.
