I think I see a business opportunity here.
Live upgrades require data structure conversion and other horrors.
You can't just write the code and expect it to maintain itself.
You'd need to rewrite half of it every time, for every patch level.
The 24x7 places might be willing to pay somebody to do this.
It's consulting work really. The customer says "I want to go
from 2.4.8 to 2.4.12", you say "OK, $320405 please.", and you
make a custom upgrade procedure for them.
