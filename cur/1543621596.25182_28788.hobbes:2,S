Hi,
I was playing this morning with the netstat command and had a segfault
when doing `netstat -ulp'. My kernel version is 2.4.17 on an i686.
I first searched for a bug in netstat and I discovered that it was a
negative inode number in /proc/net/udp that confused netstat:
$ cat /proc/net/udp
  sl  local_address rem_address   st tx_queue rx_queue tr tm->when retrnsmt   uid  timeout inode                               
[...]
  80: 00000000:02D0 00000000:0000 07 00000000:00000000 00:00000000 00000000     0        0 -2127935727 2 ca5dd060              
[...]
(Before continuing, I want to tell you that it is the first time I
look so precisely in the kernel source so please tell me if I'm
wrong or I missed something.)
If I understand the kernel source, an inode number is an unsigned
value ("typedef unsigned long __kernel_ino_t;" in
linux/include/asm-i386/posix_types.h) so it shouldn't be negative.
I tried to find where /proc/net/udp is created and I found the
function get_udp_sock in linux/net/ipv4/udp.c responsible of
generating the lines.
There, the sprintf call uses %ld instead of %lu to print the inode
number. I propose the following patch:

 		0, 0L, 0,
I don't know how to generate this kind of information in /proc, so I
didn't test it.
I also looked the 2.4.18-rc1 and 2.5.5-pre1 kernels and the bug still
exist.
