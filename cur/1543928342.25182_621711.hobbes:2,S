Heh.  I'm not ignoring the patch, and will apply it if I test it out and
see that it doesn't break anything.  Then I will let it bake in -mm for
a while.
I just don't want to rush it as this area of the kobject core is nasty
and full of tricks that I always forget.
Let me finish writing up this documentation on what I do remember and
then I'll attack the block device patch and this one.
thanks,
