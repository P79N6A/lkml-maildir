I fully agree. And I won't merge the delay patch in the current state.
It may be useful for testing with systems that are failing, though.
On the other hand, I don't believe any of todays systems need any
delays, and that most of the problems are caused by the kernel pushing
the limits of what SMM emulation can do, where the real hardware
wouldn't have problems with it.

And the most common case is the SMM code messing up 2.6 detection. 2.4
is lucky by doing the mouse initalization after the USB modules have
loaded, not doing any MUX detection at all, etc. It still has problems
on systems where there is no AUX yet BIOS reports it and a user opens
/dev/psaux.

Intel, VIA, nVidia and ALi embedded i8042 cells handle the commands with
ease. Extended notebooks i8042's usually handle multiplexing, and as
such don't have problems with the commands either. SiS seems not to
implement a few commands in some of their chipsets, but issuing the not
implemented commands has no adverse effects.
Where computer makers cut corners a LOT is the BIOS. And doing SMM mouse
emulation when you have both a real PS/2 mouse and an USB mouse is
really tricky, not only because of the data mixing intricacies, but also
because of the wide variety of PS/2 and USB hardware. Some USB mice
ignore the SetIdle call and this causes the SMM to send an endless
stream of simulated PS/2 mouse data for example.
A way to save us most of the headaches in 2.6 would be to always do the
usb handoff, unless disabled by a kernel option, by reversing the logic
of the "usb-handoff" kernel option.
That way, the playing field for i8042.c would be level with 2.4. Without
it, the driver has to avoid much more obstacles.
[Hmm, a thought. Since MUX and SMM emulation are mutually exclusive,
maybe the i8042 driver should disable MUX detection unless usb-handoff
has been specified ... unfortunately most people will not notice and
have problems with their Synaptics touchpads.]
