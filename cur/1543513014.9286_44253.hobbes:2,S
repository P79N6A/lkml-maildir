This is not correct.  Take a look at Glibc's <bits/types.h>.  Glibc 2.1
defines __ino64_t as *32* bits on 32 bit architectures.
So your call is not binary compatible with Glibc and existing programs
and Glibc would have to parse and reformat the results of getdents64 as
it does already with getdents.  I'd rather eliminate that overhead.
Perhaps this is a bug in Glibc, I don't know.  If so, they should change
__ino64_t and do the appropriate hacks for binary compatibility with old
stuff.

What's this used for?

We were discussing the d_type field, which goes in the new dirent
structure.  The structure is already defined in Glibc 2.1's <dirent.h>
and <bits/dirent.h>.  Note that d_ino is always unsigned long, and d_off
is either unsigned long or unsigned long long depending on
dirent/dirent64.

None of them, unless you make the stat contents optional like NFSv3's
readdirplus.  Reading an inode implies considerable disk overhead.

Yes, it should do what Glibc's getdirentries does because that's the
call that almost all applications use.  Currently there are also
redundent lseek() calls for all apps that read directories because of
the difference between getdents and getdirentries (BASEP).
fwiw, I have done the internal kernel API stuff.  Patch to be posted
soon.
