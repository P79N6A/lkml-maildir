To make this much more real, the /usr/sbin/named policy that ships with 
apparmor has the following line:
/** r,
Thats right, named can read any file on the system, I suppose this is 
because the policy relies on named being chrooted. So if for any reason 
named doesn't chroot its been granted read access on the entire 
filesystem. If I'm misunderstanding this policy please correct me but I 
believe this shows the problem very loudly and clearly.
