Subject: [PATCH 4/4] pci: fix section mismatch warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
drivers/pci/search.c caused following section mismatch warning
(if compiled with CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n):
WARNING: drivers/pci/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text: from .text.pci_find_bus after 'pci_find_bus' (at offset 0x24)
This was due to pci_find_bus() calling a function marked __devinit.
Fix was to remove the __devinit from the offending function.
