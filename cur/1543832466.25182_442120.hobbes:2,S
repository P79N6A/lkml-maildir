Major 216 was ttyUB%d (looks normal), but is now rfcomm%d instead?
The description claims that the device is a tty, yet it no longer
has a tty name?
Char major 204, the low-density serial ports, has some
sort of problem with the /dev/ttyCPM%d devices. Depending
on how I read things, there are 2, 4, or 6 of these.
Minors claimed: 46, 47
Minors available: 46, 47, 48, 49
Names claimed:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
The description:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Here it is in context:
44 = /dev/ttyMM0               Marvell MPSC - port 0
45 = /dev/ttyMM1               Marvell MPSC - port 1
46 = /dev/ttyCPM0              PPC CPM (SCC or SMC) - port 0
   ...
47 = /dev/ttyCPM5              PPC CPM (SCC or SMC) - port 5
50 = /dev/ttyIOC0              Altix serial card
   ...
81 = /dev/ttyIOC31             Altix serial card
82 = /dev/ttyVR0               NEC VR4100 series SIU
83 = /dev/ttyVR1               NEC VR4100 series DSIU
Less serious:
Major 78 and major 112 claim the same name.
Some names, like "/dev/iseries/vtty%d", are too damn big.
Keeping things to "/dev/tty?????" would be appreciated.
Last I checked, ttyD%d didn't match the code.
