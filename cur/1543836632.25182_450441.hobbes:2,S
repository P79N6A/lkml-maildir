Hi Komal,
Your post ended up in my spam box once again... I really think you
should send your patches as text attachements (or inline) rather than
binary attachements. Using real names in To: and Cc: fields might help
as well.

I'll review that new version later today, or tomorrow.

Slightly better, though I still don't get why you worry setting an
address that will never be used.

I should have been more precise, I guess. What surprises me are the
numbers themselves. It's frequent to see forumlae of the form
"a = (b + c/2) / c" to divide with proper rounding, but here you have
2c/3 instread of c/2. My question was more like: is it intentional, or a
typo? Also, with the code above, psc will never have value 1. The "if"
part will always compute to at least 2, and the "else" part to 0. Is
this OK?

Yes. This can be revisited later when/if someone finds a hack to work
around the problem.

Yes.

No, what I meant was rather that printing a bus number which differs
from the internal numbering might confuse the user at some point.
