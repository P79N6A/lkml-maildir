No they haven't. GNU make supports nsec mtime on Solaris and apparently
some other OS too, because the second granuality mtime can be a big 
problem with make -j<bignumber> on a big SMP box. make has to distingush
"is older" from "is newer"; "not equal" alone doesn't cut it.
[If you think it is modify your make to replace the "is older" check
for dependencies with "is not equal" and see what happens]
