No value in providing some info on what's the apreciated behaviour for 
both the coordinated disclosure and full disclosure people of the world? 
Both camps are going to continue to exist, and if you only provide 
information on the prefered aproach for coordinated disclosure then you 
have even less influence on how the full disclosure camp will spread the 
info - if you provide some info for them as well, at least some are going 
to follow it and then more of the proper kernel people will get notified 
at once instead of finding out later via other channels. I still think 
adding something along the lines of what I wrote to REPORTING-BUGS has 
merrit.

PS. Linus, adding you to CC since you're involved in the new thread on 
more or less the same topic, so I thought you might be interrested in this 
thread as well.
