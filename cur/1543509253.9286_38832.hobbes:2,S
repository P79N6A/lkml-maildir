I've been having a problem with a linux box oopsing.  (Probably hardware, if
not, I'll post the oopsen later.)  My question is this: is it possible to
configure a linux box to reboot itself after an oops?  If not, why?
This is a remote machine, getting to console over a serial line is impossible.
My only connection to it is it's network interface. A rare situation I know,
but having this function could be useful.
