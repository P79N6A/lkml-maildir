And: bad code spreads.  Anyone who has done infrastructure change in the
kernel sees this: people copy (presumed) working code.
Hence I now lean towards "change EVERYTHING" rather than "wrap old source, add
new", and "fix even if not broken", eg. my "set_bit needs a long" patch which
also changed x86-specific code (where it doesn't matter).
Cheers,
Rusty.
