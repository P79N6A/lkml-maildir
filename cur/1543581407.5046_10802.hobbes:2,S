According to Tyan, the issue should be fixed with the last BIOS update.
I'm up to date in the BIOS (and I really wish that these guys would
create a flash program that was OSS so I could avoid DOS), but one of
the work arounds suggested was setting IRQ 12 to ISA/Legacy for Windows
2000. Didn't seem to cut it.
Thanks,
