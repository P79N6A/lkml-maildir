Their distro could do it for them :-) A simple approach would be to
store md5sums of known-bad dsdt's and xdeltas to fixed ones, and the 
fixed one gets placed in /etc where mkinitrd automagically picks it up
whenever a new kernel is installed.
But that's userspace (with possible problems in distributing dsdt's, which
is why xdelta might be an acceptable solution), the kernel should just make
something like like that possible, if someone wants to do it.
