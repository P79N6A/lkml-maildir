I can't use sendfile(). I'm working with files > 4GB, and from man 2 sendfile:
ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);
int main() {
	ssize_t s1;
	off_t offset;
	size_t count;
	printf("sizeof ssize_t: %d\n", sizeof s1);
	printf("sizeof size_t: %d\n", sizeof count);
	printf("sizeof off_t: %d\n", sizeof offset);
	return 0;
}
running it
$ ./sendfile_test
sizeof ssize_t: 4
sizeof size_t: 4
sizeof off_t: 4
$ 
as far as I'm concerned, this will not allow me to address files past the 4GB 
limit (or was it 2?)
