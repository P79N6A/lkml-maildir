Good point, we shouldn't use ioremap for the system memory case at all.  
Should be __va or something I guess.

No disagreement here...  people often make the mistake when looking at 
the PCI to PCI bridge spec that it also applies to host to PCI bridges.  
And having a video ROM at 0xc0000 is common, but certainly not 
universal.

Yeah, that's what sysfs will do by default, but this code is overriding 
it's default behavior because some host bridge bit is set, it appears.

Sounds good to me, though I think we should also add the checks I 
mentioned in my other mail just to be extra robust (of course I don't 
have a system to test on, so I'm hoping Eiichiro can do it. :)
