I have tried to duplicate these two bugs and failed.  On a vanilla
2.6.22 system I set up a USB mass storage device to return an error for
the third and all subsequent reads, so the partition-detection code was
able to learn about the primary partition and the first logical
partition but not the others.  In spite of the error at this point, the
kernel cleaned up properly:
