They are undefined, yet should be cleared by the kernel which the kernel
usually does not clear.
With 2.3.39 and prior kernels, all glibc programs using si_uid get broken
values (because glibc uses a 32bit type for si_uid and thus gets usually
upper 16 bits of id garbage - running my siginfotest.c on glibc gives me
bogus si_uid like -939655168) and as I have not seen anybody complaining
about this, it makes me think not too many programs are actually using it so
far, especially libc5.
So the question is whether to fix current glibc programs, make things less
complicated and break libc5 (well, breaking means worst that on a system with uids
above 65535 you get the value truncated with old libc5 program,
recompilation helps) or leave the ._uid32 stuff in and keep glibc programs
broken and have to teach new glibc/libc5 programs about larger uids which
are somewhere else in the structure.
Cheers,
