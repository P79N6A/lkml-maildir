Subject: [PATCH] allow ptrace and /proc/PID/mem to read fixmap pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/4/26/90

It's a problem now that ptrace and /proc/PID/mem pretend the vsyscall page
does not exist, and won't let you read it from the inferior.  In fact you
can read it from yourself, but programs like a debugger should not have to
know about such magic addresses.  I think access_process_vm ought to give
you access to all of the process's adddress space.
This patch is i386-specific and should probably be done another way, but
it's what I am using now.  It works and is well-tested. 
Thanks,
Roland
