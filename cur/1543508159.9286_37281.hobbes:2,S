Hi
I recently upgraded our list server to 2.2.13pre3 (from 2.0.35) and have
started getting these kernel messages:
Sep  3 17:00:32 murphy kernel: eth0: Insufficient memory; nuking packet. 
Sep  3 17:01:33 murphy last message repeated 1341 times
It seems from the source fro the de4x5 driver that it is trying to call
dev_alloc_skb which failes for some reason, so it drops the packet. This
is a very busy machine, it typically has several hundred active processes
(qmail) and handles about a half million outbound mails each day.
From what little I know about the kernel I guess it probably is not
swapping agressively enough. The machine usualy has a free output of:
murphy{root}/home/jgg#free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         63424      53724       9700      18060       9700      23548
-/+ buffers/cache:      20476      42948
Swap:       120924       2444     118480
But I think some of those procmail processes can really chew up ram fast.
So, is this a kernel flaw, or should I be looking at tuning one of the
parameters in /proc/ ?
Also, the 2.2 kernel has made a -huge- difference to the speed of the list
server, easialy twice as fast, possibly more!
Thanks,
Jason
