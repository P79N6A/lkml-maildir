Do you have the network card in the computer - I'm having same problem,
but with 2.2.15pre5 and without network card I was unable to reproduce
this problem.
My usual way to catch this bug - 
boot SMP kernel with nosmp option into single mode
run hdparm -d 0 /dev/hda; while : ; do hdparm -t /dev/hda ; done
and after a while I get this "hda: lost interrupt message"
But not without network card (I've tried 3c59x & tulip)
