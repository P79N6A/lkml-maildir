Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.x Detect bad genksyms version
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi everyone,
I just upgraded from 2.0.x and got bitten by forgetting to install the new
modutils (I'd built them, I just forgot to install them :). I noticed when
doing 'make dep' in the kernel tree that genksyms fails but that make doesn't
abort. I looked at the relevant bits of Rules.Make and it didn't seem very
easy to do there, so I patched $(TOPDIR)/Makefile to check before
everything starts.
It might be worth while adding to 2.2.0 just to elimate a few bogus bug
reports :)
The only thing I haven't been able to do is test it when /bin/sh != /bin/bash.
Cheers,
Steve
