0.02% of the memory? Why not? I think you should be more worried
about what happens when the priority winds up.
I think your proposal to synch reclaim rates between zones is fine
when all pages have similar properties, but could behave strangely
when you do have different requirements on different zones.

min_free_kbytes? This number really isn't anything to do with balancing
and more to do with the amount of reserve kept for things like GFP_ATOMIC
and recursive allocations. Let's not lower it ;)
