External modules shall to a great extent just rely on the avialble
kernel, and any attempt to do automatic updates are not OK.
The kernel source could be RO and no rights to write in the
directories either.
So it is preferable to bail out in case we cannot build the external
module but to avoid the consistency checks all over.
Following patch does this for the configuration part.
