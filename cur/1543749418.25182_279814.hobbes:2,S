This sounds very useful for a lot of interesting stuff. Though in the
current form maybe the name is not appropriate: the module doesn't
keep track of the fork history, this would be done in user-space. The
module is more like a relay for fork monitoring.
If you plan to extend this to multiple registered user space processes
it would be great to have per process reporting policies, for example:
 - all forks,
 - only forks of descendants (children, etc).
