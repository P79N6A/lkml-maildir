Still broken: arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S wants compat_sys_fallocate instead
of sys_fallocate. Also compat_sys_fallocate probably should be moved to
fs/compat.c.
> fallocate-on-s390.patch
We reserved a different syscall number than the one that is used right now
in the patch. Please drop this patch... Martin or I will wire up the syscall
as soon as the x86 variant is merged. Everything else just causes trouble and
confusion.
