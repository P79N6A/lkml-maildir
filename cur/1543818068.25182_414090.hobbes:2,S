Erich, my sincere condolences to you and your family.
With respect to this problem, is it possible with your driver that if a 
transfer read request is above a certain size, data corruption occurs?
It may be that fsck passes because it is doing smaller transfers while a 
file copy under ext2 (or in your example, ext3) fails because it is during 
those operations that the higher max_sectors makes a difference.
Curiously, the hex values of the "want=" field in your report are as 
follows:
  sdb1: rw=0, want=12126966488, limit=312496317
  2D2D2D2D8
  sdb1: rw=0, want=12126967088, limit=312496317
  2D2D2D530
  sdb1: rw=0, want=22232771288, limit=312496317
  52D2D2AD8
  sdb1: rw=0, want=22232771888, limit=312496317
  52D2D2D30
I wonder if 0x2D or 0xD2 corresponds to something on the disk such as in 
the file being copied or is otherwise familiar.
Chris
