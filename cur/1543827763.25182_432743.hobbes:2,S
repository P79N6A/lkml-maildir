Fair enough, but if you are doing out of tree, pure GPL modules, 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() isn't a bad thing, is it?
Don't mistake me for actually having a big opinion specifically about this 
socket API's usage of EXPORT_SYMBOL()... just raising some points that I 
think apply to these decisions in general. I don't really see a compelling 
reason for EXPORT_SYMBOL() over EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() on the socket APIs 
though... I'm trying to imagine what kind of legitimate non-GPL modules might 
use them.
