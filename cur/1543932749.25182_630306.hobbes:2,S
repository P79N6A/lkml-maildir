It gets used by the routine pcibios_fix_bus_scan_quirk in
arch/x86/pci/common.c

The way the code works today, when raw_pci_ops is set to use mmconf,
it is platform-wide. Legacy pci config reads are not available.
I would have simply used the pci_direct_conf1, but because there can
also be a pci_direct_conf2, I thought it best to abstract it as
pci_legacy_conf.
A pointer to struct pci_ops pci_legacy_ops data is written into the
pci_bus.ops field for buses that must use legacy pci config access.
The other busses can continue to use the pointer to the mmconf pci_ops.
