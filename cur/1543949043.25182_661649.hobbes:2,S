So maybe we should change *that* then, and just allow arg/env to be more 
than 25%.

.. and what's the point? We've never had it before, nobody has ever cared, 
and the whole notion is just stupid. Why would we want to limit it? The 
only thing that the kernel *cares* about is the stack size - any other 
size limits are always going to be arbitrary.

Now, this is a potentially interesting argument, but is it true (ie don't 
we have programs that know about the status quo) and are people actually 
planning on doing that (for what reason?) or is it just a theoretical one?
