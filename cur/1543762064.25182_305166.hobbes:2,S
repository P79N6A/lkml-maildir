My mind kept flipping back and forth on whether it was pud_clear().
I agree, I can't see that it's the issue now.

Not an explanation I understood ;)

Yes.

Well, they specify the limits beyond which we cannot free,
because there's other stuff still making use of addresses beyond.

That can't be right.  In exit_mmap, for example, floor will be 0
throughout, and the condition will be true for all values of ceiling.

Because none of your higher level tables are being freed at all:
eventually you'll run out of memory.
I still can't see what's wrong with the code that's already
there.  My brain is seizing up, I'm taking a break.
