It looks like kmemleak exceeded it's buffer for logging initial memory
allocations requests and disabled itself (since it needs to track all
the memory allocations and kmemleak uses the slab allocator itself, it
uses this buffer). You can try to increase the size of the early_log[]
array (currently 200) in the kmemleak.c file. The current size was fine
on my embedded systems but, well, it looks like it needs to be
increased.

That's related to the early_log buffer. Once kmemleak was initialised,
it no longer calls the log_early() function and doesn't use the
early_log[] array, hence they were marked as __init. The warning is
valid but it doesn't cause any bugs in kmemleak. Any idea how to avoid
this warning and still release the __init code and data?
Another solution is to use the page allocator for the early logging
buffer and just free the pages once fully initialised, though this may
complicate the code slightly more.
