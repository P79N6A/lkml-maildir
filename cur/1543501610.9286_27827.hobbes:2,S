Hi Willy.
I've included most of your post for reference, as they are all
relevant to some extent to what I'm saying...

Agreed. However, a well designed version of the latter option would be
better, IMHO, hence the "Proof of Concept" in the enclosed tarball...

You may like to try out the enclosed bash shell script, which formats
a floppy to maximise the data area thereon whilst still remaining
MS-DOS compatible enough that both MS-DOS 5.00 and Win95 can read the
floppies without any special driver.
In addition, it can insert a text file on the diskette whilst
formatting it, and the boot sector it writes will correctly boot into
a specialised version of MORE that pages through the said file. The
same code is also present as a file called README.COM on the formatted
disk.
For reference, on a standard 1440k diskette, it achieves 1436k of data
space for the files one wishes to put on it. I would anticipate it
getting 1196k on a 1200k floppy on the same basis, giving just 4k of
overhead in both cases.

Not as hard as it sounds...especially if one is just extending one
large textfile. Handling lots of smaller textfiles would be more
complex though...
Best wishes from Riley.
