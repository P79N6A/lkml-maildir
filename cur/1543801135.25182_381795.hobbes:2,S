Have you looked at the other paths that touch ->subdir?  Namely:
  proc_devtree.c:
    proc_device_tree_add_node() -- plays games with ->subdir directly
  generic.c:
    proc_create() -- calls xlate_proc_name() which touches ->subdir and
      should therefore probably be called under BKL
    proc_register() -- both the call to xlate_proc_name() and the
      following accesses to ->subdir should be under BKL
