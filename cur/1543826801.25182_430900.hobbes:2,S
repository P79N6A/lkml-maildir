Hello all,
Any one noticed a problem with sis chipsets and the above kernels
causing a high cpuload ? Every processes executed or pressing enter to
refresh top causes a huge cpu spike usually to 100 %.
The debian sarge distro kernel 2.4.27 works flawlessly.
Appreciate a few hints/advise i can check before diving into deeper waters.
Thank you !
Mark
