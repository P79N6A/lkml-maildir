What does a performance hit have to do with an ABI? Absolutely nothing - 
if such a bug is noticed it is fixed, that's it. Your argument does not 
parse and makes absolutely zero technical sense.
Your "ABI is forever" objection against a _read only_ filesystem is a 
newbie mistake worthy of cookie file inclusion - i had a real good laugh 
when i read it ;-)
