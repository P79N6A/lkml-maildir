Well, I have had difficulties with this twice during last year. Both
times it was a partitioned CD. One was a Mac CD (IIRC), the other was an
IRIX 6.2 installation CD with SGI disklabel and EFS partition. I got the
first to work but never had success with the other (probably a user
error). fdisk found the partitions fine but gave hints of a different
blocksize (2048 vs 512). I tried to set up the partition with devmapper
(dmsetup create ...) but I could never mount the resulting partitions.
Perhaps it was a EFS filesystem driver blocksize bug, perhaps something
with my manual setup.
But I would not say the defaults have been sufficient for _me_.
