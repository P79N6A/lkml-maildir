Interesting task.  A few of those users are filesystems that fill
their own flags into inode->i_flags.  Here is an example from
fs/ext3/ialloc.c:
static int find_group_orlov(struct super_block *sb, struct inode *parent)
{
	...
	if ((parent == sb->s_root->d_inode) ||
	    (parent->i_flags & EXT3_TOPDIR_FL)) {
Shouldn't this rather be:
	if ((parent == sb->s_root->d_inode) ||
	    (EXT3_I(parent)->i_flags & EXT3_TOPDIR_FL)) {
