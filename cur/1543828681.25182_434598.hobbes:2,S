To take this further, you could indeed split struct inode into a smaller
struct that has all the important parts and a derived struct that has
i_private as well as other members that are used only by a minority
of file systems.
Alternatively, it might be possible to stuff i_private into the same
union as i_pipe, i_cdev and i_bdev. The rationale here being that
a file system implementing different file types already is complex
enough that you would normally want your own alloc_inode for a
derived struct. The simple file systems OTOH normally only support
regular files, and sometimes directories.
