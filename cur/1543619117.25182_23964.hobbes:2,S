	aasn, (as a side note)  It's really hard to allow people to just change the 
little peices.  The little peices soon become larger and more complex.  This 
is a really difficult transition in moving from (my personal perspective) an 
exciting young code base to a maturing and well functioning/planned setup.  
The only thing I have to say is that Linus had better pick his talent and 
friends well, because even if the codebase does not split today, what is to 
keep it from doing so in the future when even more complexities arise.  
	Linus,
		It doesn't have to be difficult, just as you have maintainers for the 
"stable" series yet still have a say on what happens, define the level of 
modularity you would like to happen for different maintainers to be able to 
take care of their little peices and it will happen.  Please do not allow the 
BSD split to happen here.  Be proactive and take a hard look at what you 
really want.  
	Please,
Craig.
