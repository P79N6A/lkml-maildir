	You are seriously arguing that the obfuscated binary of the firmware is the
preferred form of the firmware for the purpose of making modifications to
it?!

	What does it matter what it compiles under? The GPL is not Linux-specific.

	If you don't have the preferred form of something for the purpose of making
modifications to it, then you can't give that to people, so you *CAN'T* GPL
it. If you making an executable that derives from a GPL'd product and, for
example, lose the source code, you MAY NOT distribute the executable. You
must have the preferred form for the purpose of making modifications or you
are not able to GPL.

	But it does. This file contains the software that the hardware itself is
running. That's its sole purpose. Please tell me how you make modifications
to this file.
