Hello!
I need to make some checks (search for particular BIOS version) in the
very start of the kernel. I need to store this data (zero page is pretty good 
for this, I think) and access it from arch/i386/boot/setup.S, 
arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c and in some other places. Can somebody 
suggest me good place to put check procedure and how to pass data?
Best regards,
Andrew.
