He said "read the news". I've seen the 9110 and 9210's, I was asking where
this news was.

The point is that you need a known good, absolutely rock-solid OS to do it,
and IMHO, you really need a customised job, not something like Linux, which
is a monolith in comparison.

In the mobile world, that is *all* WAP.

I'd *like* to, sure, but this is impractical because the mobile links suck
so hard. Dunno about you, but it takes a few seconds to pull in a <1k page.
Ugh. SSH? Games, sure, I point my phone at a 7110 or 6210 and I can play
2-player Snake 2 :)

True, but you have to be wary of overkill, like I said.

I've used RedHat since I was about 11, Debian since 13. It's not that hard,
if you can just get used to it. But you're playing with yourself if you
think that KDE has more games than Win2k ... Black & White? All the Star
Wars games? etc ... I know a lot of them are being ported to Linux, most via
Loki, but still ...
(I use GNOME, and the panel giving me Bus errors is starting to annoy me).

Oh, I think it's just to do with changing state, seeing as most of the
lockups I get are when I hit keys really, really quickly in sequence, and
one lands just as the screen's blank, and it's changing state (snake 2 can
also kill it).
