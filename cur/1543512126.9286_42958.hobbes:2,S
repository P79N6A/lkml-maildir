How about using /etc/rc.d/rc.local? Or /etc/inittab?
At boot time: chmod 660 /dev/fd0
That is what rc files are there for. This works with devfs
without a necessity for devfsd.
We already have dynamic /dev, but there is no standard for it,
there are a dozen groups doing it in as many ways.  We have UUID's,
/proc/sound/dev (path?), /dev/pts, SCSI, PCMCIA, USB. I'm sure there
are others that I'm not familiar with.  We have network devices that do
not have entries in /dev because they are dynamic and /dev isn't, so we
have a seperate mechanism for dealing with them...very unUnixlike.  
I think devfs can fix a lot more problems than people give it
credit for.

You are assuming that "permanent permissions" is a benefit you
really have, and that it is desirable.
I disagree on both counts.

I would say that the above paragraph says it all.
Of course the proposed course of action would break a system
that uses modules, like OSS.

Seems to fail safe to me, failure or non-use of permission handling
machinery would result in default permissions.  These tend to be
_more_secure_ than modified permissions.

Right, like any 2 Unix systems manage their devices in the same way.
Irix, AIX, Openserver, SVR4, QNX, BSD, pick 2 that have the same
device management mechanism out of that list, I dare you.

It does so.  Just expect a consistent set of permissions at boot time.

That would be how capabilities are managed.  That thread convinced me
that capabilities are enforced in kernel space, but held in user
space. And this is worse than the current system in what way?

Some need to be.

devfs solves so many more problems than "naming issues" that this isn't
even funny.

devfs stands to _save_ a lot of work for developers by freeing them up
from how to manage the next set of dynamic devices.  The people that seem
to be arguing against it the loudest are the Admins who would have
to change a few lines in their scripts to account for a consistent
/dev at boot time.
