I'm glad to say that this is the first 2.4 kernel that works on my noritake
alpha with a pci-pci bridge.
I have a small problem.  If I reboot, the srm console can't boot from dka0.
Doing a: show dev
doesn't list any of the hard drives in the machine.
doing an init causes it to reset and find all the drives again.
