  I frankly don't know.  Maybe it's just one faulty controller, 
connector or whatever.  Maybe the card manufacturer screwed up 
somewhere.  I mean, the only course I took in electronics is 
introductory digital circuits which used 74xx chips and push triggered 
clock on a breadboard.  What would I know about gigahertz signaling 
error.  :-p
  Though, one thing I can say is majority of 311x controllers don't seem 
to suffer from this problem.  So, take your pick.
