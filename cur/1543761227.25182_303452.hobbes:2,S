Subject: BK snapshots broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/16/117

The snapshots on kernel.org are being created from the most recent tag 
in the BK repo, which is 2.6.11.3.  That means they are missing all of 
the changesets between the 2.6.11 and 2.6.11.3 tags, and don't apply to 
a clean 2.6.11 tree.
