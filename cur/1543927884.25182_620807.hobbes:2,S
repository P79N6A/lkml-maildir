So, you're saying that there's a problem with in-tree modules using symbols 
they shouldn't?  Can you give an example?

If people aren't reviewing, this won't make them review.  I don't think the 
problem is that people are conniving to avoid review.

Probably, but this doesn't reduce it.

*This* makes sense.  But it's not clear that the burden should be placed on 
kernel coders.  You can create a list yourself.  How do I tell the difference 
between "truly publicly exported" symbols and others?
If a symbol has more than one in-tree user, it's hard to argue against an 
out-of-tree module using the symbol, unless you're arguing against *all* 
out-of-tree modules.
Sorry,
Rusty.
