I will still argue that my approach is the better technical solution for large
block support than yours, I don't think we made progress on that. And I'm
quite sure we agreed at the VM summit not to rely on your patches for
VM or IO scalability.

But you just showed in two emails that you don't understand what the
problem is. To reiterate: lumpy reclaim does *not* invalidate my formulae;
and antifrag does *not* isolate the issue.

Some problems can not be solved easily or at all within reasonable
constraints. I have no problems with that. And it is a valid stance to
take on the fragmentation issue, and the hash collision problem, etc.
But what do you say about viable alternatives that do not have to
worry about these "unlikely scenarios", full stop? So, why should we
not use fsblock for higher order page support?
Last times this came up, you dismissed the fsblock approach because it
adds another layer of complexity (even though it is simpler than the
buffer layer it replaces); and also had some other strange objection like
you thought it provides higher order pages or something.
And as far as the problems I bring up with your approach, you say they
shouldn't be likely, don't really matter, can be fixed as we go along, or
want me to show they are a problem in a real world situation!! :P

I didn't skip that. We have large page pools today. How does that give
first class of support to those allocations if you have to have memory
reserves?
