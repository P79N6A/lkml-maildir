Jeff,
XFS does not put data into the log. It keeps track of meta-data operations
in the log. One goal of XFS is to remove the need for fsck at start-up.
This is a very big deal when one has very large file systems. fsck can
take a very long time on very large file systems.
If you are looking for a file system that logs data, XFS is
not your solution. XFS does allow a file to be written synchronously
with O_SYNC so you can guarantee that the data is on disk
when the write returns.
There is much more to XFS than the log and journalling.
Saying that because XFS doesn't log data, it is no better than NTFS
doesn't address all the other aspects of XFS.
Have you seen the latest XFS white paper? The current one off of SGI's
web page is pretty old. The latest paper compares NTFS, XFS,
VxFS and is a pretty good overview of XFS. XFS has had more
stuff added to it in recent months (like a new defag tool)
which is not in the paper.
I just looked around and I don't see a publicly available web
jumper for it. We'll set one up and I'll send it around next
week.
