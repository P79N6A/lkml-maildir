Of course, it is a hardcoded constant, look in asm/processor.h
#define TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE      (TASK_SIZE / 3)
That defines where kernel starts looking for free areas available for
mmaping.
On the other side, if you mmap with a chosen virtual address, you should be
able to mmap more, of course provided your application is statically linked.
Otherwise stuff like shared libraries and dynamic linker will have to be
mapped somewhere as well (in that case, see ELF_ET_DYN_BASE in asm/elf.h).
Cheers,
