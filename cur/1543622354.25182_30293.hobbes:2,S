This came up a few months ago. Don't halve the size. The value was
explained to NOT be a bug even though it doesn't make sense to us
mortals. Just set the buffer size without reading anything. It will
be fine. The explaination was somewhat smokey, but It seems as though
two buffers are set aside or something like that. Just don't read
the size. Set it and forget it.
