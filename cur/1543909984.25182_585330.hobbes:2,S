I don't understand this patch.  <rdma/ib_verbs.h> says this about
ib_create_qp():
 * @qp_init_attr: A list of initial attributes required to create the
 *   QP.  If QP creation succeeds, then the attributes are updated to
 *   the actual capabilities of the created QP.
So it seems the current code is actually correct and your patch breaks
it??
