Well I just left it as it was for the default case...
I haven't tested much at all for different batching levels.  And
in this area, tuning it for my combination of hardware probably
doesn't carry much relevance for Jeff's setup (for example).
And the change to FIFO wakeup may have invalidated your earlier
testing.
So hmm.  I'll have a play with it, and if nothing obvious jumps
out, I'll just clamp it at 32.
