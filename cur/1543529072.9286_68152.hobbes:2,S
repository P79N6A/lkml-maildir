We're working on it. Andrea Arcangeli is currently improving 
the disk scheduling algorithm, I have some (small) changes to
the memory management subsystem and a number of other people
are working on patches that aren't ready/public yet...
It's true that we lag somewhat behind FreeBSD in this point,
but we're working on it :)
regards,
Rik
