Alright, this one is only triggered when slab debugging is enabled.  The slabs
are assumed to be aligned on a HUGEPTE_TABLE_SIZE boundary.  The free path
makes use of this assumption and uses the lowest nibble to pass around an index
into an array of kmem_cache pointers.  With slab debugging turned on, the slab
is still aligned, but the "working" object pointer is not.  This would break
the assumption above that a full nibble is available for the PGF_CACHENUM_MASK.
The following patch reduces PGF_CACHENUM_MASK to cover only the two least
significant bits, which is enough to cover the current number of 4 pgtable
cache types.  Then use this constant to mask out the appropriate part of the
huge pte pointer.
