It does, but it has been deimplemented in the Linus tree and never put into
the -ac tree. You would need -aa for working O_DIRECT or use a raw device.
Also they both have some restrictions on buffer alignment, but these would be 
already fulfilled if UML internally writes through the page cache (which 
it does of course)
