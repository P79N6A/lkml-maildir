Patch applied, kernel built, laptop_mode activated, but my disk just doesn't 
want to spin down... 
I have to activate it using ACPI BATT events, since my machine does not send 
out ACAD events. This is in /var/log/acpid:
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] received event "battery BAT2 00000080 00000000"
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] executing action "/etc/acpi/battery.sh"
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] BEGIN HANDLER MESSAGES
Setting HD spindown to 20 seconds
Starting laptop_mode.
/dev/hda:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to 0x01 (1)
 setting standby to 4 (20 seconds)
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] END HANDLER MESSAGES
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] action exited with status 0
[Mon Jan 12 11:26:18 2004] completed event "battery BAT2 00000080 00000000"
Laptop mode is active:
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode 
1
Commit values have been applied:
$ mount -t reiserfs
/dev/hda6 on / type reiserfs (rw,noatime,notail,commit=600)
/dev/hda7 on /home type reiserfs (rw,noatime,notail,commit=600)
But the disk never spins down. Not that I can tell, hdparm -C /dev/hda always 
tells me active/idle, and the sdsl tool also reports 100% disk spinning...
anything else I have to activate/check?
