It's a great goal, but which gcc version and architecture do you
declare has to build the kernel with -Werror?  Every gcc version and
platform produces a different set of warnings.  And what do you do
when all released versions of gcc produce a false positive warning?
The problem is that fixing false positive warnings often leads people
to write unnatural code that may hide future bugs (and in fact may be
buggy even when written).
