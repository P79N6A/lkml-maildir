On an FC1 machine during initscripts these patches give:
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.
VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 336k freed
Write protecting the kernel read-only data: 787k
VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of nfsd. Self-destruct in 5 seconds.  Have a nice day...

The same happens with just #1 and #2 applied.  The .config is at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/config-vmm.
The kernel won't compile with just patch #1 applied.  Patches shouldn't go
into git in that manner.
