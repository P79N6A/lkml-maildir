Well, the support for IBM's SCSI controllers in v2.2.x is very buggy.
Michael Lang has put a tremendous lot of work into making a working
version available, and hopefully there will be one soon.
3c523 should work in v2.2.x; I don't know about v2.0.x with the
mca-patches.

We mainly need help testing on other models than model 9556; still, I'll
send you things to test from time to time if that's ok...
