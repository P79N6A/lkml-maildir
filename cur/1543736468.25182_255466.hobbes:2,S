You know, this actually seems like an easier process than the serial
console.  Is there any good reason this isn't the "recommended" way to
diagnose lockups?  Unless they used to work at a telco ;-), most users
are more likely to have an ethernet crossover cable handy than a serial
cable.
Here's the netconsole mini-mini HOWTO.
load the module like:
    insmod netconsole \ 
    netconsole=source-port@source-ip/net-interface,dest-port@dest-ip/MAC-address
for example: 
    modprobe netconsole \
    netconsole=1234@69.44.153.169/eth0,4567@64.81.245.32/00:0A:8A:05:3D:80
then connect the other machine and run:
    netcat -u -l -p dest-port
to watch the output.
