Hi guys
I'm getting the following "strange" message in my kernel logs. Probably
nothing serious but I would like to know what could be the cause.
/sbin/lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Relience Computer CNB20HE (rev 23)
00:00.1 Host bridge: Relience Computer CNB20HE (rev 01)
00:00.2 Host bridge: Relience Computer: Unknown device 0006 (rev 01)
00:00.3 Host bridge: Relience Computer: Unknown device 0006 (rev 01)
message:
Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 31.
Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
Does anyone knows what is reason 31 NMI for my chipset ?
Thanks
