timer_interpolator kind of interface helps for one part of HPET changes.
That is using HPET during gettimeofday(). Unfortunately, i386 has its
own timer infrastructure (which is quite similar to timer_interpolator),
which is already being used by variety of timers that exist (cyclone_timer,
tsc, pit - code under arch/i386/kernel/timers). i386 timers seems to be 
the superset of timer_interpolator.
struct timer_opts{
        int (*init)(char *override);
        void (*mark_offset)(void);
        unsigned long (*get_offset)(void);
        unsigned long long (*monotonic_clock)(void);
        void (*delay)(unsigned long);
};
I agree, in future, it is best to integrate these timers in an 
architecture independent way. 
The other part of HPET change is, change in kernel base timer. In i386, 
along with local APIC timer interrupts, we also have a IRQ0 timer interrupt.
This is where kernel time-keeping happens (similar to TIME_KEEPER_ID in IPF).
This will also used for process times in UP case, when there is no LAPIC.
As of now this interrupt comes from PIT/8254. HPET will replace this too, 
and can be programmed to generate periodic interrupts at a particular rate.
This part may be specific to i386.
