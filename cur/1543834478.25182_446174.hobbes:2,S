Subject: [Patch 0/2] CPU hotplug compatible alloc_percpu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Patch 1/2 addresses alloc_percpu's generous way of grabbing memory for
offline cpu's. It allows clients to fix up per-cpu data in their CPU
hotplug handlers, avoiding waste of memory for unused cpu's.
The existing alloc_percpu() / free_percpu() interface has been
reimplemented on top of the enhanced interface.
Patch 2/2 moves the statistic infrastructure over to the enhanced
interface.

Patches are against 2.6.18-rc1-mm2.
Tested on s390, SMP (w/ and w/o cpu hotplug), and UP.
