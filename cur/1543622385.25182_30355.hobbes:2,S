Hello Benjamin and all of the guys on the lists,
I'm pretty much interested in socket async I/O for a project at work. I
read the document at 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/io/aionotes.txt
and I saw that patches are available at
http://kanga.kvack.org/~blah/aio/
I also searched linux-kernel archives for some status information, but
couldn't gain much info (other than a couple of discussion threads back in
late 1999).
What we need is a standard aio/thread-pool-in-sigwaitinfo architecture and
we wouldn't like to use select/poll.
I would also like to contribute on this project if it could somehow help 
(if my boss lets me, of course ...)
I promise to narrow the distribution as long as I know who to talk to!
Thanks,
Marco.
