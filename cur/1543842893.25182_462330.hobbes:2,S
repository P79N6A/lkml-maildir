Also added class_device's below of /sys/class/pktcdvd , so that
the file layout is now:
/sys/class/pktcdvd/pktcdvd[0-7]/
                         dev
                         uevent
> Use /sys/class/pktcdvd/ and use struct device instead of struct

Hmm, sorry. Don't know how to do this. The only thing i found
is the code in class.c, where struct class_device is used to create
these "dev" and "uevent" files...
Any comments?
