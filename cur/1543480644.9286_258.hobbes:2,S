I think he hit a nail on the head somewhere there...
a single uniform mechanism for waiting for stuff was
what I liked so much about select(), but now I see it
isn't up to the task.  Sun had a modified select() back in
SunWindows days to allow you to wait for UI events, too;
I wonder if there's an elegant generalization to select()
that could be useful in the future?

I don't feel comfortable being so smug, at least in public.  
Let's underpromise and overperform instead of the other way around.
