ZONE_DMA is only used as ZONE_NORMAL if the architecture does not 
need ZONE_NORMAL because all of memory is reachable via DMA.

I already explained that twice to you. I think we all agree that the 
situation could be better.

Its bad but its not useless. See how various arches use it.

That wont work because many architectures use different limits. Maybe you 
should once in a while have a look at the sources.
The patchset leaves the semantics of ZONE_DMA as memory beyond 
MAX_DMA_ADDRESS as is. Nothing should break. It only allows us to opt out 
of this scheme if we do not need it.
