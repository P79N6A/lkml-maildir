Well, for sure it's quite a demanding task, since, if I remember
correctly, the module-code uses some nasty internal gcc-knowledge to
generate code, that simply doesn't work with later versions of gcc.
It might be that I remember this incorrectly though.
It would be interesting, yes, but only if it can be proved to some
degree that no new bugs are introduced.
My aim for 2.0.41 is to make it a cleanup-release; remove warnings, tidy
up a little source-code mess, kill dead code, fix typos etc.
