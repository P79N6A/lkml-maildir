Worse in RT context: It makes it unhealthy to call from a RT task as it 
doesn't have predictable runtime unless you know that the target task is 
not blocked on a deep locking tree.
I know this is very unlikely to happen very often in real life and this 
thread isn't about preempt-realtime, but I'll say it anyway: Hard realtime 
is about avoiding surprisingly long execution times - especially those 
which are  extremely unlikely to happen, but nevertheless are possible, 
because you are not very likely to see those situations in any tests, and 
therefore you can suddenly miss deadlines in the field without a clue what 
is happening.
