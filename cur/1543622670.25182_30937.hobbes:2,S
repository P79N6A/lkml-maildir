In theory we can share.  Maybe.  There is some evidence of a firmware
bug which means we can get interrupts without status bits being set
properly.  If this is so, then sharing will be very difficult.  At the
moment the "Null event" message is in there to help track this down -
with the side effect that sharing is not possible - at least not
without dealing with thousands of "Null event" messages.
