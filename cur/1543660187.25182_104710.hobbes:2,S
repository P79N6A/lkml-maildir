You missed the reason entirely ;-)
pci_set_mwi() is brand new, I just added it.  Hasn't filtered down to
drivers yet.  The few drivers that cared prior to its addition, like
drivers/net/acenic.c, just hand-coded the workarounds needed for proper
MWI support on all chipsets.
pci_set_mwi() would not exist at all, were it not for the existing
hardware quirks.  (if hardware were sane, drivers would just
individually twiddle the _INVALIDATE bit in PCI_COMMAND, and never call
functions other than pci_{read,write}_config_word.
