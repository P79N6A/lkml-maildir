Btw, this is an important point - people have long felt that the new page 
balancing in 2.6.19 was to blame, but you've just confirmed the long-held 
suspicion (at least by me) that it's not actually a new bug at all, it's 
just that the dirty page balancing causes writeback to happen _earlier_, 
and thus is better able to _show_ a bug that we've likely had for a long 
long time.
