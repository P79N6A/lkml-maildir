The point is to eliminate the writes for the address and buffer
fields in the ring descriptor right? I don't really see the point
because you have to twiggle at least the owner bit, so you
always have a cacheline sized transaction on the bus.
And that would likely include the ring descriptor anyways, just
implicitely in the read-modify-write cycle.
If you're worried about the latencies of the separate writes
you could always use write combining to combine the writes.
If you write the full cache line you could possibly even
avoid the read in this cae.
On x86-64 it can be enabled for writel/writeq with CONFIG_UNORDERED_IO.
You just have to be careful to add all the required memory
barriers, but the driver should have that already if it works
on IA64/sparc64/alpha/ppc64. 
It's an experimental option not enabled by default on x86-64 because
the performance implications haven't been really investigated well.
You could probably do it on i386 too by setting the right MSR
or adding a ioremap_wc()
