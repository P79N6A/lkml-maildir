We have several linux 2.6.9 accesing to a netapp filer via nfs to
update several thousands of files. The application only need to read a
few blocks of the files when updating so we found out that disabling
the read-ahead on the server improve greatly the performance by
maintaining a clean cache and decreasing the number of access to disk.
We have been trying to disable the read-ahead in the client as well to
reduce the access to the server even further; but we couldn't find
 where to do this in the 2.6 kernel family. Is it possible?, or it is
simply that on 2.6 kernels it is not possible to tune the nfs client.
