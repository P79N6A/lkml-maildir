Ok, so lets determine if it really is XFS.  Does the lockup happen with a
different filesystem on the md device? Or if you can't test that, does
any other XFS filesystem you have show the same problem?
If it is xfs that is causing the problem, what happens if you
remount read-only instead of unmounting before shutting down?
What about freezing the filesystem?
Cheers,
Dave.
