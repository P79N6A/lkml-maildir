ITYM "hides".  You've just lost anything resembling typechecking of
arguments; it might be wrong in the current form, but at least we
get a reminder of possible problems.
With __force you've lost _all_ warnings - anything goes.  NAK.  At the
very least, figure out what type should the argument be and add a
(non-force) cast to that before forcing it.
