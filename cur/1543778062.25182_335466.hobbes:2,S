	Al salaam, 
My name is Haja mashed from Brunei I am a 23 years old and a mongolian citizen who was taken to Brunei by my father 10 years ago. He deceived me that I was going there on vacation and later married me out to a wealthy Prince in Brunei who is 30 years older than me.
I was thus forced into marriage and when I objected I was beaten and raped by this Prince. I was locked up in a house for six months after which I submitted and decided to accept my faith, knowing that was the only way out.
After I got my freedom back I have been allowed by my husband to have access to his account and businesses. With the help of a loyal aide I have been able to divert $16.5.000.000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thousand dollars)as bonds into a private finance house without his knowledgement.
Right now I have mapped out a plan of escape out of Brunei,thou I have tried escaping several times and its been fruitless. first of all I have been able to move the fund out of Brunei. This is where I need your assistance,to help me secure the fund from the finance house before I get out of Brunei if I am lucky enough.
If you know you are capable of handling such a huge amount of money respond to me and I will compensate you by giving you $1.5.000.000.00 (one million five hundred thousand dollars) of the total fund.
Note also that you must keep this transaction secret as my life is at stake if my husband or any of his relatives hear of this transaction they will stone me to death or hang me.
I await your quick email.
Haja mashed
