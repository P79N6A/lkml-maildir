I noticed them too.
By the way, it would be nice to move the discussion to the mailing list of 
the driver, orinoco-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  Sorry that it wasn't 
mentioned in the MAINTAINERS file.  I've just submitted a patch to add the 
mailing lists to that file.

The HEAD version of the driver aims to support Linux starting with version 
2.4.10, so you need to add some magic in kcompat.h to define __iomem.
HostAP driver uses cast to (void *), which compiles without warnings.  I 
believe it's sufficient because the call to readw() would cast the 
argument to whatever readw() needs.
Another, more sophisticated solution would be to use union for iobase:
typedef struct hermes {
         union {
                 unsigned long io;
                 void *mem;
         } base;
         int io_space; /* 1 if we IO-mapped IO, 0 for memory-mapped IO? */
 	...
}
