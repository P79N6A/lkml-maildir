Ugh. Both of your suggestions look ugly. Using the O_* flags, you just need 
to have a compatibility header file which contains:
#ifndef HAVE_O_SEQUENTIAL
#       define O_SEQUENTIAL     0
#endif
Then in the code you just use O_SEQUENTIAL and if the system doesn't know 
about it it is optimised away at compile time.
Note how nicely this fits in with autoconf/automake where the ./configure 
script can test for O_SEQUENTIAL and if it is not there automatically 
define it to 0. That then means your code is completely free from these 
ugly #ifdefs.
Thanks for making your point as that is ANOTHER argument for using open(2) 
instead of fadvise() [1]. (-;
Cheers,
Anton
[1] Yeah, I know, one could also define fadvise() to nothing in the compat 
header file...
