It looks like I was probably wrong.  I need to do some debugging, but
the only sparc64 machine here at hand is in use.
If anybody would be up for running 2.6.13 on a sparc64 host and
running tests with a patched aoe driver, please let me know.  A test
would look something like this, using an x86 host and a sparc64 host
on the same LAN.
  x86$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/0x1234567 bs=1k count=1 seek=19088742
  x86$ vblade 0 1 eth0 /tmp/0x1234567
  sparc64$ rmmod aoe
  sparc64$ cd ~/linux-2.6.13
  sparc64$ patch -p1 < aoe.diff
  sparc64$ make && make modules_install
  sparc64$ modprobe aoe
I'd email you patches, and you'd email me the printk messages that
show up in the logs.  Such help would be much appreciated.
