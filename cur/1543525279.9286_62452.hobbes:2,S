Hmmmm. Is this SMP or IDE related?
I have been running v2.3.xx since xx == 12 or so, with some skips for kernels
that didn't compile without PCI etc, quite some time with v2.3.38 and now I'm
running v2.3.42. I'm running Debian Potato (well, I've set the distribution to
Woody now, actually, but that's beside the point here, I guess) and do all my
updates via apt-get. No problems whatsoever. This is on an admittedly slow
computer (486slc2/50) so maybe it's too slow to trigger race-conditions.
Still, this might be a point of information that can be useful.
