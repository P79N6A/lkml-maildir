please try to reproduce the bad behaviour with 2.4.4aa2. There's a bug
in the parent-timeslice patch in 2.4 that I fixed while backporting it
to 2.2aa and that I now forward ported the fix to 2.4aa. The fact 2.4.4
gives the whole timeslice to the child just gives more light to such
bug. Unfortunately the fix doesn't apply cleanly to 2.4.4 (it's
incremental with the numa-scheduler patch) and I need to finish a few
more things before I can backport it myself.
