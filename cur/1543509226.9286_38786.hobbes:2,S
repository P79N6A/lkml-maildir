Hmm. For me it builds entirely cleanly with 2.3.18 on i586.
I suppose you use a more recent version of glibc.

You should be worried.
If gcc redefines dev_t, then no doubt it invents a different size,
and structs will have the wrong size, and struct access will fail.
Typically, this is a problem with losetup.
See all the comments in <linux/loop.h>.
Normally, the C library converts from kernel to user data representation.
But this happens only on system calls, not for ioctls.
This problem has come up before, and I thought I had solved it,
but maybe changes in kernel and/or glibc now cause it to appear again.
Please send glibc version and error messages to aeb@cwi.nl.
