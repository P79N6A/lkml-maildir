Interesting.  How did you actually notice this?  Is the same problem not present
in 2.4?
If the IS_ERR(page) returns true, should we not advance f_pos to skip this
page?
If the filldir() call returns non-zero your patch will leave f_pos pointing at
the problematic directory entry.  I'm not sure whether this is desirable.
hmm, ext2_readir() isn't propagating EFAULT back up to the caller.
