One new machine appears but it generates small traffic rate (by now
it's almost unused).

No - firewall is bridging IPv4 only. There was no dramatic topology
change. Those VLANs which are going through this firewall were
untouched.

I don't think so that managed IP of firewall was targetet, maybe
machines behid firewall but problem appears on eth2 interface which
is:
internet <-trunk-> eth1(firewall/iptables)eth2<-trunk->(switch
ports) <-> servers
So it's after iptables ...

It is strange to me too. There is no dependency when it happens.
Sometimes traffic is small, sometimes it's normal. Packet rates are
around ~2000-3000 pkt/sec - so not so high.
