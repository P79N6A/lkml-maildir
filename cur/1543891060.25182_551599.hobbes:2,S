You say no, but then you go on to contradict yourself below.

There, you just ascribed the synchronous property to barrier requests. 
This is false.  Barriers are about ordering, synchronous writes are 
another thing entirely.  The filesystem is supposed to use barriers to 
maintain ordering for journal data.  If you are trying to handle a 
synchronous write request, that's another flag.

That's why for synchronous writes, you set the flag to mark the request 
as synchronous, which has nothing at all to do with barriers.  You are 
trying to use barriers to solve two different problems.  Use one flag to 
indicate ordering, and another to indicate synchronisity.

This is a side effect of the implementation of the barrier, not part of 
the semantics of barriers, so you shouldn't rely on this behavior.  You 
don't have to use FUA to handle the barrier request, and if you don't, 
then the request can be completed while the data is still in the write 
cache.  You just have to make sure to flush it before any subsequent 
requests.

Yep... two problems... two flags.

We do the former or we end up in the same boat as O_DIRECT; where you 
have one flag that means several things, and no way to specify you only 
need some of those and not the others.
