  I buy three drives at a time so I have a matching spare, because AFAIC
you shouldn't be doing RAID on unmatched drives.
  Using RAID1 is especially important when using software instead
of hardware for fault-tolerance because the software is more likely to
have bugs just because of the 'culture' of hardware vs. software
developers, and the RAID5 algorithm is very hard to get right anyway,
especially in failure/rebuild mode.  Even on a hardware controller
RAID5 is still inherently less reliable.
 (...and what's all this about unreliable drives, anyway?  Every drive
I have bought since 1987 still works.)
