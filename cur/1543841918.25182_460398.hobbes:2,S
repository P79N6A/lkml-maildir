Thanks. My lkml subscription bounced last week after I decided to
overhaul my home email (moving country in a couple of weeks...).
I disagree that MODULE_FIRMWARE encodes policy in the driver. It encodes
a reference - nothing more. We need to know what firmware we're going to
be asked for if we have any hope of being able to package up drivers for
use in distro initrds and the like. I think we can agree on that much.
Some alternatives:
* The firmware API get hacked yet again to use static strings we can
parse (ugly) or otherwise somehow provide this information.
* We add hacks in userspace "if it's this driver and someone used
MODULE_VERSION correctly, and we can determine the right firmware...".

I'm ok with the idea of having a generic name, but it does add more
processing in userspace. Frankly, I don't care what is adopted but
something needs to be done - sooner or later, it's going to be more
drivers than Qlogic (and a few others) we need this working for :-)
I'm optimistic that we'll find the right one line patch eventually!
Jon.
