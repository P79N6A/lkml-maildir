in theory, these should be interchangable. Not tested though.

this case is a little more obscure imo, and not worth the effort.

not easy, given we execute cmov instructions before we even hit
a printk. Such a test & output needs to be done in assembly in early
startup.

Which gets us back to the question of why this is needed at all ?
You said earlier "In case you hadn't fully grokked it, my code doesn't
disable the workaround!"  So why do you need this ?

Yep, brain fart.
