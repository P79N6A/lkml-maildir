While that experience may apply well to IP, this is a non-IP protocol
for a single LAN.  For any given AoE device, there are only a few
outstanding packets at any given time.
For existing AoE devices that number of outstanding packets is only
three!  So, with only three packets on the wire at any time for a
given device, 16 bits is overkill.  In fact, the AoE protocol allows
the AoE device to specify how many outstanding packets it supports.
That number is only 16 bits wide.  
If it ever did become desirable, we could use a couple more bits for
the sequence number by borrowing from the low bits of jiffies that we
use to estimate the RTT, but it doesn't seem likely to ever be
desirable.

I think you're talking about your suggestion that the skb allocation
could lead to a deadlock.  If I'm correct, this issue is similar to
the one that led us to create a mempool for the buf structs we use.

The sequence number is a non-issue, and for the deadlock danger you
originally suggested that we add a warning against using aoe storage
for swap.  We could add such a warning to the driver's documentation
and start working on a patch that avoids deadlocking on the skb
allocation.  There's no need to panic and force users go get a third
party driver.
