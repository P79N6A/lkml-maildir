Ok, even more slowly.  
Yes there could, because the computer that used your IP-nr a minute
ago didn't close the connection to its port 24 before it went off
line. Therefore you will receive quite legitimate but obsolete packets
destined for port 24, and since you don't send a reset, the sender
will keep sending them until it times out, which can take time.
