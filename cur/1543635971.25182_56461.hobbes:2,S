   Another thing that was implemented is a netfilter chain for ARP, but
   afaik there are no filtering modules for it yet, so Joe User cannot
   use it. It likely just exists somewhere as a proprietary module in
   someone's firewall appliance and all they did was to contribute the
   hook. It probably would not be hard to rewrite a filter module for it,
   but again nobody did it yet.
I wrote the kernel bits but never got around to coding up the
netfilter user tools.  Assuming, just because of lacking userland
tools, it was for some "proprietary firewall appliance" is pretty
damn rude.  You could have at least looked at who the author was
and asked him (ie. me). :(
