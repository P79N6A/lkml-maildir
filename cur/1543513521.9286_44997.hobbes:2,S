bash$ grep sys_call_table kernel/*.c
kernel/ksyms.c:extern void *sys_call_table;
kernel/ksyms.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_call_table);
Sigh ...
MIPS syscalls are sufficiently non-standard that so far
 - NOT A SINGLE ATTEMPT at using certain syscalls like pread(2) or pwrite(2)
   via the _syscall* macros from <asm/unistd.h> yet has been successful.
   non-obvious enough that probably.  What works on Intel doesn't necessarily
   work somewhere else.
 - NOT A SINGLE PIECE of code which tries itself at patching sys_call_table
   ever also thought of the necessity of patching sys_narg_table.  
   My suggestion for the future: let's change the symbol name of
   sys_call_table weekly such that nobody thinks about using it anymore.
Calling sys_something() how is ok.
