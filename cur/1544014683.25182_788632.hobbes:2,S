James,
This net-namespaces work sounds quite apropos to some of my other
projects but I'm having trouble figuring out whether it can be used to
solve my current problem. Two questions which immediately occur to me
include:
  1) As with the netfilter suggestions provided by Andi and Evgeniy, it
  seems that processes require special privileges (e.g. CAP_NET_ADMIN) in
  order to drop network privileges by means of entering a new net
  namespace. Is this correct? If so, why is it necessary or appropriate?
  2) What happens if I call unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) after I've bound some
  sockets to an address or connected some sockets to remote endpoints?
Perhaps you can help straighten me out, e.g. by pointing me at the
relevant code?
Thanks very much,
Michael
