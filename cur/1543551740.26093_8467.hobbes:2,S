No it doesn't.  It depends mainly on whether the ABI for the
machine says that arguments are pushed onto the stack in
left-to-right or right-to-left order.  You could do either on
x86, for instance, and it has nothing to do with whether the x86
stack grows up or down.

Non sequitur: I see no function pointers being evaluated here.
