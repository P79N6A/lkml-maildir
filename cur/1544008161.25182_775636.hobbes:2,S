Hi, Ivo, John and others.
First of all, sorry for the late reply. But I'm still here and I can
help get things straight. I just had some (once more) health problems
(I'm not currently that well).

Yes, there are. Here I reproduce the logs from both 2.6.27.x which is

enabled).
Thanks for your kind help, Rogério Brito.
