Sounds sane.  bzip2 is really hurt by the hart limit of 900k for block
sorting.
Inside the kernel, other things start to matter, though.  If you
really want to impress me, take some large test data (your mozilla.tar
or whatever), cut it up into chunks of 4k and compress each chunk
individually.  Does lzma still beat gzip?
If you can at least get it to compress better for 64k chunks, that's
already quite interesting.  But excellent compression with infinite
chunk-size and infinite memory is quite pointless inside the kernel.
Such things should be left in userspace where they belong.
