I have posted and posted about this bug, introduced
around test3, because unplugging and replugging my
keyboard gets really old after a while.  I had figured
whoever introduced it would fix it.  That didn't
happen, so I figured someone else would fix it after
submitting a bug report, but no, it continued to make
the next release.
PLEASE, I am not trying to be rude, but I do not know
how else to report that this is, in fact a bug
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229
with my uhci interface, it will either turn off after
a while(the keyboard completely) or all the lights go
on(Reset?) and the keycodes go screwy.  On my ohci
interface(usb 2 card) the former still happens.
PLEASE
