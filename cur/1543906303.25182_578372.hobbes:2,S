I think so too and I have to talk to Jetway/VIA what there is going wrong.

Ok, but when we don't habe the driver for the usb controller, I think
the BIOS should control it because
maybe the BIOS found for example a keyboard or mouse and emulates it as
an PS2 keayboard/mouse,
so we could use it without the usb driver. I think that's why they
developed the handoff feature.
Are there any known hardware which has problems when we disable the handoff?
