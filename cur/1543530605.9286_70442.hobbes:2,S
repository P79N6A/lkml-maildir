Subject: Memory Leak in the pre-2.4 series?

Since I don't have any real proof to explain this, I'll try and be
quick.  With 2.3.51 and 2.2.14pre14, I leave X on for days at a time, with
no problems.  However, when running the pre-2.4 kernels (currently
pre2-4), I've noticed
something interesting - when running X overnight, without anything but
enlightenment and a couple of builtin programs running, I find that an
enormous amount of memory is being used by the system, and no process
seems to be allocating that much.  Whereas there are usually about 13MB
w/o buffers/cache used while just running console, there are now 57 MB
used, and no programs seem to be using that much memory - this seems like
a huge kernel memory leak, but I cannot explain what is causing it.
