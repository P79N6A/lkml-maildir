the synchronous signal sending looks fine.
the brainer part here is what happens after sending the signal: how to
eventually fallback to sigkill. how do you fallback from a graceful
signal (one that can be handled in userspace) to an "hard" one like
sigkill that guarantees the stability of the system? I mean, you could
set a timer, and then try to kill the task with sigkill later if it's
still there after a few seconds you sent the graceful signal. There may
be different solutions to this.
But we need a fallback like the above because we can't trust userspace,
if the task doesn't go away, we've to sigkill it eventually.
Even sending sigkill immediatly would be acceptable (despite it would
prevent userspace to exit gracefully).

yes, stack usage is normally very limited.

agreed.
