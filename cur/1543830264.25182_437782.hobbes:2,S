yeah, you are right - sorry about that.
XFS instead loops infinitely:
 void *
 kmem_alloc(size_t size, unsigned int __nocast flags)
 {
         int     retries = 0;
         gfp_t   lflags = kmem_flags_convert(flags);
         void    *ptr;
         do {
                 if (size < MAX_SLAB_SIZE || retries > MAX_VMALLOCS)
                         ptr = kmalloc(size, lflags);
                 else
                         ptr = __vmalloc(size, lflags, PAGE_KERNEL);
                 if (ptr || (flags & (KM_MAYFAIL|KM_NOSLEEP)))
                         return ptr;
                 if (!(++retries % 100))
                         printk(KERN_ERR "XFS: possible memory allocation "
                                         "deadlock in %s (mode:0x%x)\n",
                                         __FUNCTION__, lflags);
                 blk_congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/50);
         } while (1);
 }
which is in essence an open-coded GFP_NOFAIL implementation. Here's what 
__GFP_NOFAIL does:
                        if (gfp_mask & __GFP_NOFAIL) {
                                blk_congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/50);
                                goto nofail_alloc;
                        }
and since XFS makes use of KM_SLEEP in 130+ callsites, that means it is 
in essence using GFP_NOFAIL massively!
