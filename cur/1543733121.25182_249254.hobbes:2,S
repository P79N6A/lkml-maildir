Yeah I had seen a few, surprisingly few though. Sorry I'm a bit clueless
about networking - I suppose there is a good reason for the 16K MTU? My
first thought might be that a 4K one could be better on CPU cache as well
as lighter on the mm. I know the networking guys know what they're doing
though...

Well let me be the first to say I don't want to stop that from happening.
With regard to getting this patchset tested, I might see if I can hunt
down another e1000 and give it a try at the end of the week. If anyone
would like to beat me to it, just let me know and I'll send out a new
set of patches with those couple of required fixes.
