    I would much prefer a union of pointers over a pointer to a union.
    Why? Because if you have a "struct inode", you also have enough
    information to decide _which_ of the two types of pointers you have, so
    you can do the proper dis-ambiguation of the union and properly select
    either 'inode->dev.char' or 'inode->dev.block' depending on other
    information in the inode.
I am not sure whether we agree or differ in opinion. I wouldn't mind
/* pairing for dev_t to bd_op/cd_op */
struct bc_device {
        struct list_head        bd_hash;
        atomic_t                bd_count;
        dev_t                   bd_dev;
        atomic_t                bd_openers;
        union {
		struct block_device_operations_and_data *bd_op;
		struct char_device_operations_and_data *cd_op;
	}
        struct semaphore        bd_sem;
};
typedef struct bc_device *kdev_t;
and in an inode
	kdev_t dev;
	dev_t rdev;
In reality we want the pair (dev_t, pointer to stuff), but then
there is all this administrative nonsense needed to make sure
that nobody uses the pointer after the module has been unloaded
that makes the pointer a bit thicker.
       And we should not depend on the "inode->dev.xxxx" pointer
       being valid all the time, as there is absolutely zero point
       in initializing the pointer every time somebody does a "ls -l /dev".
Yes, that is why I want to go back and have dev_t rdev, not kdev_t.
The lookup is done when the device is opened.
