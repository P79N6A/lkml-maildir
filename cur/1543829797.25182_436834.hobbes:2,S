We already mark write often structures with __cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
The idea behind __read_mostly is to separate variables like cpu maps,
bootcpuinfo etc which are written to very very rarely -- during 
initialization/hot-plugging, but read quite often something like ~100 % read
ratio.  They might not be sharing the cacheline with a 
variable which is not as frequently written to, to mark 
__cacheline_aligned_in_smp, but still, these often read variables would be 
invalidated in cache every time there is a write on these other variables.  
Considering that there are quite a few structures which are read often,
(like cpu maps, cpu info, node to cpu maps etc) it made sense to place them 
in a separate section.
When we mark  variables __read_mostly, it doesn't mean all that is left in
.bss and .data is write mostly.  Surely the rest of .data and .bss which
do not qualify for ~100% read would not be ~100% write/RMW.  We would have 
variables which experience varying ratio of reads and writes.
So as I see it the current scheme of thing is 
1. If a variable is written quite often -- mark __cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
2. If a variable is read quite often .. something like 99:1 read -- mark them

Most of the variables we marked as __read_mostly were ones we were seeing
inter-node transfers for read, when we shouldn't be seeing any -- because
they are just written to once during bootup.  And it did not make sense to 
mark the other writers on the inter-node cacheline __cacheline_aligned_in_smp, 
since it would mean a bloat of 128-4096 bytes depending on the arch, and
those variables were not written often enough to warrant padding. A few not
so-often-written variables on the same cacheline would mean these read
mostly variables are always being invalidated.

Sure, we can change users of __cacheline_aligned_in_smp to __write_often and
change the section to .data.write_mostly from .data.cacheline_aligned for 
readability sake.  But, IMHO we do need the __read_mostly section for variables
which experience near 100% read access.  I cannot see any negative aspects of
having a separate read mostly section as there is no padding or bloating
involved.  Granted, we might not see performance difference with some builds
due to the compiler/linker placement / code changes, but this might
resurface later with a newer build/code changes.
