Don't think so (you're referring to Jeff's git-sas-jg.patch?).  It dies
with current -linus tree.
drivers/scsi/sd.c: In function `sd_read_capacity':
drivers/scsi/sd.c:1301: internal error--unrecognizable insn:

            (set (reg:SI 0 %eax)

It'll be workable aroundable of course, but it's a hassle.
