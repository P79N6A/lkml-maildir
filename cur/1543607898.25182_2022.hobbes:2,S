I test 2.4.9 , 2.4.10-ac7, 2.4.13 and all have this problem, I'm not using 
XFS, but reiserfs with LVM and 4 GB RAM. I detected if use tmpfs the kswapd 
eat my all CPU's, in 2.4.13 the system hang after a time. Now I'm testing 
2.4.13-ac3 without tmpfs and he is very better than the others versions. But 
a nice test is disable the HIGHMEM support. I have a machine with 1GB RAM and 
the system is very fine and stable, running 2.4.10-ac7.
