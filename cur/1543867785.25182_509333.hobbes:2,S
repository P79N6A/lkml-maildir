I wasn't disputing legal problems with proprietary drivers nor suggesting people ignore 
the issue.  I was trying to make the point that Linux is adversely affected when lots of 
users, proprietary developers or otherwise, abandon Linux, and the issue might be more 
serious than people here think.
IMO the lack of provision for proprietary drivers in the GPL is a problem.  Not 
necessarily one we can do anything about now the horse has bolted, but a problem nonetheless.
