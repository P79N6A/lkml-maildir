Ah, well all of them are Maxtor drives... One 6y250m0 and three 7y250m0 
drives. I'm using powermax on them right now. They all passed the quick 
test, and the full test results are forthcoming.
Actually, I was backing up the array (cp from the array - 2 of 3 drives 
running - to a normal drive) when I read your response. Shortly 
thereafter, during the cp (perhaps after copying 100GB-120GB), I got a 
double fault. I've never gotten a double fault before, but I'm guessing 
it's quite a serious error. It totally locked up the machine, and it 
outputted two lines each with a double fault message, followed by a 
register dump.
The saga continues...
