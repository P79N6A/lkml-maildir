Well, it's a beautiful thing when something finally works that you've been
struggling with for a while.
I loaded the Redhat default .config for i586 and modified it taking out
things I knew I didn't want, especially all the extra modules they select.
Anyway, the install went great - although it didn't work when I tried to use
the initrd image for some reason.  But, I took that line out of lilo.conf,
ran lilo, rebooted and it ran through like it should have.  Now to play
around with the .config file to streamline it more to my machine
configuration.  Thanks everyone for the help! You guys are great.
