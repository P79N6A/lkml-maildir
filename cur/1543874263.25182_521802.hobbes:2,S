This patch format is somewhat inconvenient:
 > # HG changeset patch
 > # User Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@pathscale.com>
I assume this is the real author of the patch (as opposed to the
sender of the email)?  git would prefer to see
From: Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@pathscale.com>
in the body of the email.
 > # Date 1173994464 25200

And all of these "#" lines get put into the patch description.

No need to duplicate the subject line.
And incidentally, it would be better to use "IB/ipath: " instead of
"IB/ipath -" as a prefix, to match the canonical style of
"<subsystem>: " for patch headers.
Don't worry about resending, I can fix this up, but it would be nice
not to have to worry about it.
