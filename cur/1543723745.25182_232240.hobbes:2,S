There's no inherent reason your P2B shouldn't boot. I know for
a fact that its successor, the P3B-F, boots just fine.
Your .config contains a lot of stuff not needed for booting,
you should eliminate it and try a minimal .config. In your
case, I'd definitely remove
CONFIG_EDD=y
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_FB=y
and possibly also
CONFIG_ISAPNP=y
CONFIG_SENSORS=y
You can always add them back once you've identified the breakage.
