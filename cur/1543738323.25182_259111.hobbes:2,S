Greg I see nothing to back up the idea that IBTA intends to go after
non-members.  I simply see a disclaimer of warranty, and I see wording
by your anonymous source that restates a disclaimer of warranty.
Until I see something more to back this up I do not see a problem.  In
fact I see infiniband prices dropping, and competition increasing.
The drivers off of openib.org look like they are a good start at
making a sane linux implementation.
Even the PCI-SIG requires you to pay for the spec.
I agree it would be suicidally insane for the infiniband trade
association to go after a linux stack, as it appears that a large
portion of the infiniband users are currently running linux.
Given the vendors I have seen working on hardware and the vendors
who are a part of the infiniband trade association there does appear
to be a certain amount of disconnect between the two.  So this
may be an attempt to bring all of the interested parties together.
