It requires some cooperation from modutils - it knows which module depends
on which, so you cannot release foo-init. And it has no idea about __init -
it could eventually lead to call into released memory on another module
insmod. And, unfortunately, you cannot use this aproach for objects build
into kernel - these __init sections are stored only in kernel image, nowhere
else.
