Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've updated the EDD code to use driverfs instead of /proc.  It's now
exported as:
.
|-- edd
|   |-- 80
|   |   `-- info
|   |-- 81
|   |   `-- info
|   |-- 82
|   |   `-- info
|   |-- 83
|   |   `-- info
|   |-- 84
|   |   `-- info
|   `-- 85
|       `-- info
where 80..85 are the BIOS device numbers, and info is a file that displays
the same information I was displaying before.  Thanks Patrick for the
pointers, and once the top-level firmware/bios/whatever directory is made,
it can move there easily.
Patch available from 
http://domsch.com/linux/edd30/edd-driverfs-1.patch
 and
http://domsch.com/linux/edd30/edd-driverfs-1.patch.sign
 applies against
2.5.34 or BK-current, and is the whole of the feature, not incremental.
Also in BK at 
http://mdomsch.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-edd.
The next logical extension would be to make a symlink 'disk' in each
directory that points at the PCI bus:dev.fn/scsiX/a:b:c:d:disk file for the
appropriate disk.  However, I'm in a quandry...  There's no simple way to do
this.
For EDD to do the mapping itself, it needs to walk various lists of devices
(Scsi_Disks, IDE disks, ...)  Those lists aren't currently exported.
EDD could do it itself brute-force, except that it knows all the information
*except* the scsiX host logical number, so it would still have to some sort
of lookup.  That nice physical (and virtually identical logical) path got a
kernel-logical component added which requires a lookup. :-(   The third
problem is that mapping needs to happen at device discovery time, not at EDD
load time, else scsi-add-single-device and/or modular IDE insertions later
won't pick it up.
So, I start thinking about making calls from the various disk type drivers
back to the EDD code to get the symlinks made.  That touches more than I
wanted to this round, but is probably the best way to go, and what I'll
investigate.  Per-arch dummy asm/edd.h dummy files with noop functions for
the calls into EDD that are only x86-applicable...  yuck.
Thoughts?
Thanks,
Matt
