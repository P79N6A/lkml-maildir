Hi Andrew,
my personal opinon is that this new development model isn't a good 
idea from the point of view of users:
There's much worth in having a very stable kernel. Many people use for 
different reasons self-compiled ftp.kernel.org kernels. In 2.4, it took 
until at about 2.4.18 or 2.4.22 [1] until it was reasonable stable. 
Today, most code in the 2.4 kernel has had several years of testing and 
it's therefore quite stable even in unusual configurations. Besides 
this, an upgrade like from 2.4.25 to 2.4.26 is pretty low-risk since  
there shouldn't be any changes that might break existing setups.
If your work together with Linus is so effective, why can't you both do 
all the changes in a new 2.7 tree that includes also all incompatible 
and potential dangerous changes as well as the removal of obsolete code 
like devfs or OSS. I don't see the negative effect if a 2.7 branch was 
created today and together with a feature freeze for 2.7 three months  
from now this might result in a 2.8.0 before christmas [2] that contains 
all the new features/removals/changes while 2.6 will evolve further into 
a rock-solid stable kernel.

[1] there are different opinions on the exact version number, but it was
    definitely not 2.4.10
[2] perhaps a bit optimistic, but it shouldn't be years from now
