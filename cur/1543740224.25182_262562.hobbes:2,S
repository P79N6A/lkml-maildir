Hard to say. My crystal ball doesn't work any better than yours.

It depends. I'd probably be willing to drop $100 USD on such a card simply
to vote with my wallet what my priorities and values are.

For most of what I do, 3-D is irrelevant. It makes nice eye candy, but
that's about it. For games, hardware-accelerated 3-D is more or less
required.
> (4) How much extra would you be willing to pay for excellent 3D performance?
An extra $100 USD. For superior 3-D performance (and a buttload of RAM on
the card), I'd go an extra $200.
> (5) What's most important to you, performance, price, or stability?
Stability, followed by performance. I'm less price sensitive than I used to
be.
