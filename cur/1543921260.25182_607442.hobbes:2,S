thanks for the comments!  I'll work through these.
There are definitely plenty of open issues I haven't yet tackled in the 
driver area, as you are seeing.  As you noted, a lot of these are with 
drivers doing weird things like calling their own interrupt function 
with (-1, NULL) or (0, NULL), which triggers some magic "I'm polling" 
behavior.
