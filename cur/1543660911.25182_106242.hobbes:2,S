Call this a USB 1.0 design bug, partially papered over in the code.
There are two adjacent variable length bitmaps.  One of the notable
changes in USB 1.1 was to say the second bitmap isn't really used,
and must be filled with ones.
The code in 2.4.9 (or thereabouts) behaved reasonably here, by
declaring just one single bitmap and expecting users of that bitmap
to cope with its quirkiness.  But somewhere along the line that
bit map got changed to two fixed-size bitmaps.
The checker is basically complaining about a "#define bitmap"
that lets driver code be written to reflect the reality of
two adjacent variable-size bitmaps.  Quite reasonably so.
Somehow, making drivers/usb/core/hub.h go back to having a
more sensible declaration has never been high on the priority
list.  Worth fixing someday, but not a "bug" in the sense of
being incorrect -- only in the sense of being confusing.
