Hi Linus,
We've been doing some stress-testing on 2.4.14-pre6 and have encountered
a couple of problems.  The platform is an 8xPIII with 8G RAM and 32G
swap.  After running Cerberus for about 3 hours, the machine hung
completely.  I was not able to switch VC's.
Unfortunately, this is as detailed a bug report as I can submit.  It
looks like Magic SysRq is broken in this kernel.  <alt><SysRq>T will
print the column headings but nothing else.
