I get this as well on my G200. From observation it appears that the 
refresh rate is being doubled when you exit X and that's why the 
console appears blank. On my system I normally use
modprobe matroxfb vesa=263 fv=85
to give a large text console. On return from X, if I blindly type
fbset "640x480-60"
then I get a visible screen back but my monitor tells me that it's 
running at 640x480@119Hz. Same thing for 800x600-60 only this one says
120Hz.
Base system is SuSE 7.1 using XFree86 4.0.2. If I switch to 3.3.6 then
it works OK. If I don't load matroxfb then it also works OK.
