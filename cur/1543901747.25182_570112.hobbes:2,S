yeah, no doubt about it, but this fix breaks my box _for sure_, while 
whatever problem the commit fixed, it was not something that ever 
triggered on my boxes =B-)
so ... i can promise to test whatever new version of the patch Olaf 
sends me (the problem is easy to reproduce and easy to test, so i can 
check it all in a heartbeat), so to get things back on track, and to 
value the time i spent on bisecting this, could we please apply the 
revert upstream (temporarily), because Linus' -git tree as of today is 
still broken for me. (and likely broken for others)
