This is to be expected.  You aren't getting the error in the old drive not
because the sequencer doesn't have the bug, but because the INQUIRY is
happening before we negotiate WIDE transfer mode.  The actual overrun is
because we have an odd INQUIRY buffer length and WIDE transfer which means we
get an extra byte from the drive and the current version of the driver is
seeing that extra byte as an overrun instead of a wide residue.  This only
happens on your drive type because most drives don't bother to send in enough
data to fill in the entire 255 byte buffer.
