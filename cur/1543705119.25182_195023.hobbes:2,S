 Of course, but DOS is not BIOS and the assumption is we want to use the
adapter as a boot console and with Linux.  The former is handled with
appropriate firmware and the latter with a driver.
 Actually I had an opportunity to use a few PC/AT headless systems (no
video adapter at all, although one could be placed in a PCI slot) with an
option called "serial console redirection" in the firmware.  Their BIOS
setup program proved to work just fine over a serial line (unfortunately a
VT100 terminal was assumed, so I had to type e.g. ^[OP to "press" <F1>,
but it worked) as well any console output, including LILO (which had to be
taught to use the regular console instead of accessing the serial port for
I/O directly).
