You are absolutely right.
We have to try to avoid this waste of resources when we put features
into feature-removal-schedule.txt.  That's what I meant with "the hard
part" in the other post.
BTW, of course it doesn't suffice to say "we can't remove it yet" after
the due day.  There need to be well-founded reasons for another
deferral.  Of course if there are such reasons, it means something went
wrong when the feature was put into removal schedule.  (Some facts
weren't known.)

Yep; if that page helps to collect the facts, then all the better.
Though in the very end, a feature goes away by means of a patch.

Funny (or not so) how this sentence applies to all kinds of activities
into which more than one person is involved.  So let's try to plan our
work carefully and *timely*, to let as little of it go to waste as possible.
