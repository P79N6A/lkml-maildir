I'll pipe up and say this one more time:
 - if you don't want to debug PCMCIA module loading, do not compile the
   PCMCIA code as modules!
It's known to be broken.  I left the module option in, because I hoped
somebody would actually want to debug it.  Nobody seems to want to do
that, so I'll probably just remove the option, and force people to
either compile it into the kernel or use the completely stand-alone
PCMCIA support. 
The keyboard/mouse loss should be fixed in the pre-2.4 tree.
