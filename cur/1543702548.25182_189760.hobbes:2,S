However, we can solve Linux's designed-in braindamage.

No, the security lies in the fact that the remote server knows the user 
is privileged to access it.  It's a side issue that the mount itself is 
made using an automounter.

??  As part of our research into namespaces, we at Sun have gone through 
and tried to identify the number of semantic changes required to achieve 
user-privileged mounting, however we never saw the need to do anything 
special at all in 'each filesystem driver'.  The issue is one of a 
permission model and should be out of scope for individual filesystems.

Other systems such as plan 9 have done it though..    If anything is 
keeping us from doing it, it's the traditional unix mount semantics and 
the security models that have been built on top of them.
