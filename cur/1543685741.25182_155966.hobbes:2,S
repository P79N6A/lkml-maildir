I'm personally OK with it, and in fact I talked about this with James
(converting random.c over to the crypto API and the implications)
early on while we were first working on the crypto kernel bits.
But I fear some embedded folks might bark.  Especially if the
resulting code size is significantly larger.
We could make it a config option CONFIG_RANDOM_CRYPTOAPI.
All of this analysis nearly requires a working implementation so
someone can do a code-size and performance comparison between
the two cases.  I know this is what you're trying to avoid, having
to code up what might be just thrown away :(
