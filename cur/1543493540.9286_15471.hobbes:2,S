This address is not possible as far as I remember since it needs to be on
a 64 Mb boundary. However S3 has managed to screw up one of the simplest
rules of PCI configuration register spaces: that you can only tell the
amount of memory a board uses by writing all ones and reading back. 
My Trio64 claims it needs 8 Mb when actually it occupies 64Mb.  Some
BIOSes know this and work around the problem, others don't (I don't blame
the BIOSes, it's a very serious bug from S3). 
So we have to find a 64 Mb hole where to put the board. What does lspci -v
or cat /proc/pci tell about your PCI devices ? 
(you should say which version of the kernel you use).
