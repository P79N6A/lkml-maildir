No, because cat is using 4K chunks and the data has to be written in one
large chunk, like this:
# dd if=microcode of=/dev/cpu/microcode bs=141312 count=1
This actually works fine but you need to convert microcode data from human
readable (what Intel distribute) to binary format first. Easily done with
microcode_ctl utility.
