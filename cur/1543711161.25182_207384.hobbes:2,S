I assume ia64 does idling using the ACPI processor.c driver? If so, couldn't
writing to /proc/acpi/processor/./power be an option?

I doubt it -- there's no ia64 cpufreq driver anyway, and cpufreq is about
frequency scaling and (sometimes) throttling, but not "idling". And
"idling" is a too different implementation anyways.
