I don't know if the hp82xxxx is an IDE or SCSI model, but you might want 
to make sure ide-scsi support is compiled in or loaded as a module. 
 This was required for us to use cdrecord with an IDE cd writer.  If you 
are sure it is a SCSI cd writer, ignore the ide-scsi advice.  As far as 
actually burning a CD, we do something like the following:
mkisofs \
    -translation-table \
    -joliet \
    -rational-rock \
    -o CD-IMAGE-NAME.iso \
    DIRECTORY-CONTAINING-WHAT-YOU-WANT-TO-WRITE
cdrecord -eject -v speed=4 -isosize CD-IMAGE-NAME.iso dev=3,3,0
You will need to change the dev=x,y,z to something appropriate, the 
syntax is scsibus,target,lun.  Try cdrecord -scanbus to find the proper 
values.  Also change the speed=4 to something appropriate for your cd 
writer.  There are probably gui tools which will allow you to do this 
easier, but I am not familiar with them (search google or freshmeat.net 
or the KDE or Gnome sites).
