Hi,
  I'm having problems with the SunRPC code over TCP due to a 'bug' in
the TCP layer. In function tcp_fin(), the code is calling the
state_change() method on the socket BEFORE the state is actually
changed.
  Since the SunRPC code hooks the state_change() method in order to
keep track of the state of the socket, this is a problem. It may or
may not also give an SMP race in Linux-2.3.x if somebody is sleeping
on the socket, and the kernel lock is not being held.
  Would it therefore be possible to apply the following patch on both 
linux-2.2.x and linux-2.3.x. It moves the call to state_change() and
the associated socket wakeup to immediately after the change of state
in tcp_fin().
Cheers,
  Trond
