Well, this series breaks ARM as well:
In file included from include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:12,
                 from arch/arm/include/asm/byteorder.h:23,
                 from include/linux/kernel.h:20,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:52,
                 from arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.c:13:
include/linux/swab.h: In function '__fswab64':
