Do *you* read the GPL and tell me where exactly it does *explicitly*
allow to change license notices at all. Ya know, that right is reserved
by law and must be *explicitly* granted. So just not explicitly
forbidding it isn't enough.

It permits modifications of the *work*, but not of the license.
(Re)Licensing is a *seperate* reserved right of copyright holders.

No. Copyright reserves rights. Copyright imposes *all* restrictions by
itself. You need to explicitly relinguish the restrictions for others to
be allowed to do just nearly *anything* (except fair use rights) with
the work.

It grants modification rights to the *work*, but not modification of
license (relicensing).

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
Now, the copyright holder hirself can exercise any rights anyway, as zie
doesn't need any license at all, anyway. And then, you just are not
allowed to restrict *rights granted herein*. But the *rights granted
herein* do not include relicensing (or where does the GPL explicitly
grant the right of relicensing?). So one *may* restrict relicensing.
In fact relicensing is restricted by "default" (law).
