Hello,
since I upgraded from kernel 2.2.13 to 2.2.17, I get these messages too,
but once, the system got frozen right after such a message. The only
solution was the reset button... (the system was stable with 2.2.13 about
half a year with the same configuration)
Please mail me, if you need further information, I am not in the list.
Regards, Peter
