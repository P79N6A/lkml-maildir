With my EPoX 8K9A3+, I had to hack the kernel to get the HPT374 running 
at all, as it reported slightly higher PCI clock than 33MHz, although 
the machine wasn't overclocked, but it seems to run fine. The current 
driver supports only 33MHz clock, which is probably the reason HPT374 
isn't even initialized in some cases.
