I'd suggest just doing that when you convert the utf-8 format to printable 
format _anyway_.  At that point you just make the "printable" 
representation be the binary escape sequence (which you have to have for 
other non-printable utf-8 characters anyway).
And if you do things right (ie you allow user input in that same escaped 
output format), you can allow users to re-create the exact "broken utf-8". 
Which is actually important just so that the user can fix it up (ie 
imagine the user noticing that the filename is broken, and now needs to do 
a "mv broken-name fixed-name" - the user needs some way to re-create the 
brokenness).
