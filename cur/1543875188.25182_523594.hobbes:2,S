OK.  I wasn't paying particularly close attention.  But my rant still
stands ;)

OK.
Why is it a "fuss" to do this with hugetlbfs files, btw?
Having read back through the thread, the only substantiation I can really
see is
  The pagetable_operations API opens up possibilities to do some
  additional (and completely sane) things.  For example, I have a patch
  that alters the character device code below to make use of a hugetlb
  ZERO_PAGE.  This eliminates almost all the up-front fault time, allowing
  pages to be COW'ed only when first written to.  We cannot do things like
  this with hugetlbfs anymore because we have a set of complex semantics to
  preserve.
Why is this actually a useful feature?
What does "complex semantics to preserve" mean?
I dunno.  I see a lot of code flying around, but comparatively little
effort to describe the actual problems which we're trying to solve.
