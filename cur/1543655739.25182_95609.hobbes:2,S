Linus talked about this once, and it was agreed that the only sane way
to do this properly was via vsyscalls... have a page mapped somewhere in
high (kernel-area) memory, say at 0xfffff000, but readable by normal
processes.  A system call can be invoked via call 0xfffff000, and the
*kernel* enters whatever code is appropriate to enter itself.

Now that's just braindead...
