	I can only agree.
	This seems to be reasonable. But I suggest to investigage
	the other ways further. Just to be fair to all solutions and to
	have a good, instead of a "political" solution. I argumented
	also for investigation of all solutions when the "everything
	in user area" arguments came.
	But as I told in another mail: I want to investigate the
	driver buffer solution first:
	I found out that the size of DMA memory is, for example
	also limited for the SB 128 PCI card by 256MB. And with
	256MB sound DMA buffer I still have dropouts under disk
	load. So just enlarging the DMA buffer is not sufficient as
	solution.
	A linklist of 4K buffers (buffer queue) seems necessary.
	And as you pointed out the buffers have to be locked in
	memory and the access must be realtime. The buffers
	can be requested and freed dynamical on open/close or
	with usage. This way memory is only used when the
	sound device is used.
	Is there already some 4K linklist of buffers system in the
	kernel that can be used (code reuse is a good weapon
	aggainst kernel bloat)? I guess that the buffer cache is
	too much filesystem related.
	I looked into the alsa driver and was impressed.
	Very structured, very systematic.
	From what I saw I think that there are only a few
	places where a buffer queue has to interface.
	Something like:
	   write_to_buffer_queue(queue, char *data, int length,
	      int *hi_reached);
	   read_from_buffer_queue(queue, char *data, int length,
	      int *lo_reached);
	Just a rough idea ... 
	hi/low_reached can also be return values
	Also some:
	   open_buffer_queue(queue, int hi_mark, int low_mark)
	   close_buffer_queue(queue)
	   empty_buffer_queue(queue)
	seems necessary.
	And of course it needs to interface with the alsa and
	the oss sound drivers. From first sight:
	 - In the alsa driver it seems to be possible that the
	   buffer_queue can be called from the generic part
	   of the driver (not shure about this).
	 - For the oss driver I don't know.
	Greetings Thomas
