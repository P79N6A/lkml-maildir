No, I don't think so. Not in it's current form.
Currently, usbtouchscreen doesn't have any means to initialize an 
EEPROM. And in the absence of such a possibility, you need other 
means to accomplish your task. The current behavior provides you 
with this "plan b":
If you set the rate and that doesn't work because no EEPROM is 
there, the driver fails. While doing it, it will release the 
device.
This brings in the opportunity to access the touchscreen 
controller from userspace, e.g. with libusb, and write the 
EEPROM. After this, reboot, and be happy. Because now the device 
would act correctly on the "set rate" command and would be 
usable.
