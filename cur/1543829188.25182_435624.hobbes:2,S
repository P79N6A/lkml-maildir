Hi,
sorry if I'm being dense - what is actually being protected against
here?  The only thing I can think of is one process causing performance
degradation to another by moving it's memory further from it's cpu on a
NUMA machine.
Is there something more?  (And is what I'm guessing even possible?)
I'm not arguing against this hook, just wondering whether there's
more to this than I see.
thanks,
-serge
