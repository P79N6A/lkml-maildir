	Sounds pretty cool to me...  Alot depends on how fast it is, and
if it's easily configurable and can be turned on/off easily...  I'd say,
go ahead and send it, as long as it isn't too big (If it's big, send a
URL to it), and see what people think. :)  You may want to check out the
info about submitting a patch in the Documentation directory of the source
tree before submitting it, if you havn't already...
