My 2 cents would be to keep it as it is.  BK says WARN_ON was used
in place of BUG_ON in local_bh_enable just for the the ppp ldisc.  
We all know tty locking is broken and needs rewrite, but 
if we kill such symptoms at driver level, it'll probably deprive
some data points to whoever rewrites the tty layer.
Thanks,
