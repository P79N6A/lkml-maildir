Hi,
 I've been having trouble with one of my DAC960's RAID, which was in a
co-located server. It started by working perfectly, and all of the
sudden (within a 15 day period) our server simply died until rebooted.
The log analisys never gave us a clue about what the problem was, until
I got to the datacenter myself, to have a look.
 A couple shift+pageups after, I saw a bunch of lines from the DAC960
driver code telling me the disks were dead (logs below). Strangest
think, the disk enclosure lights did not indicate disk failure (they're
SEAGATE, SCA U160 drives) and after a quick'n'dirty reboot, everything
is back where it should be - and running perfectly.
 The RAID is in our lab now, and it has been running a stress test for
about 7 days. At last, we can see the problem reproduced. Here are some
status reports (some of which are quite strange - the status is still
OK):
zbr:~ # cat /proc/rd/status
OK
zbr:~ # cat /proc/rd/c0/current_status

 The disks are still mounted, but a ls simply hangs:
zbr:~ # mount
/dev/hda3 on / type ext2 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,mode=0620,gid=5)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda2 on /home type ext2 (rw)
shmfs on /dev/shm type shm (rw)
none on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
/dev/rd/c0d0p3 on /mnt/linux type ext3 (rw)
/dev/rd/c0d0p1 on /mnt/linux/boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/rd/c0d0p5 on /mnt/linux/tmp type ext3 (rw)
/dev/rd/c0d0p6 on /mnt/linux/var type ext3 (rw)
/dev/rd/c0d0p7 on /mnt/linux/servicos type ext3 (rw)
zbr:~ # cd /mnt/linux/
zbr:/mnt/linux # ls
(no output, simply hangs)
 We've checked the cables, the mylex card itself, everything seems to be
in order. I could bet a reasonable amount of money that after a reboot
everything will be just fine.
 Kernels tested: 
stock 2.4.18
RH's 2.4.20
 Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Thanks in advance,
