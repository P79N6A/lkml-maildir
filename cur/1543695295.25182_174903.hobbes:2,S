I've never had any problems with pppoed in 2.[56]. (I am connected through
it right now).
There's one pitfall however: at least in the (somewhat rotten) SuSE 7.0
based setup I use, /etc/rc.d/pppoed explicitly checks the kernel version.
Since 2.6 perfectly works with the 2.4 settings, I just had to change the
case "2.4.*)" into "2.[456].*)"
