Are you sure it does? LGDT with non zero argument shouldn't be that costly. 
The %fs switching adds some locked cycles for reloading the segment cache, 
but because Windows uses that I would it expect to be reasonably optimized 
on CPUs. 
I actually tried to complain because on x86-64 it is more costly, but to
no avail.
