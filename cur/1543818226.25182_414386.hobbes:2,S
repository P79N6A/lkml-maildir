1) Documentation - it is obvious that the function/data is exported so
be a bit mroe careful when introducing changes
2) Style. In 2.6 the preferred style is to put the EXPORT_SYMBOL on the
line following the closing } of the exported function.
3) Keep changes local. If one removes a previously exported symbol less
files needs to be touched.
