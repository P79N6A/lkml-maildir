Typically the MMX/3dnow/SSE memory copies get enabled where possible.

Arjan and a few others spent weeks tuning the memset/memcpy functions,
there's really not that much room for improvement with them imo.
I spent a week or so a while back trying in vain to squeeze out just a
few more MB/s, and failed to get good results across the board.
There are a few tricks that can be pulled to do things like copying
backwards to trick hardware prefetchers, but this starts to get into
voodoo land.
For now, the i386 optimised memcpy is probably a closed book.
x86-64 may reopen that book to revisit some lessons learned..

I would be (pleasantly) surprised to see gcc turn a C memcpy into faster
assembly than our current implementation. And I'll bet
$beverage_of_choice it'll stay that way for some time.
gcc has come on in leaps and bounds, but for something as performance
critical as memory copying/clearing, hand tuned assembly wins hands down.
Even AMD's/Intel's performance guides suggest doing this. It's the only
way to fly.
