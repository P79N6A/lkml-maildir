I have the new bios(BP6NJ) and have no problems. Kernels 2.2.14pre14 and
2.3.33 both are absolutely stable at 84Hmz. (2x400 Celerons) with
hendriks ide.2.3.33.19991214.patch.bz2 patch. There is an ongoing 
problem with the cdrom producing this *error with the patches but it
works fine otherwise. Kernel 2.2.13 with the ide patch also gives the
same error
*
hdc: ide_wait_noerr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: ide_wait_noerr: error=0x04
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error
}
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04
hdc: ATAPI 5X CD-ROM drive, 240kB Cache
*UPDATE* (You guys jinxed me) Just as I was sending this I got this
error.
(Kernel 2.3.33 with ide patch)
