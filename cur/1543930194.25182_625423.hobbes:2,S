Subject: [PATCH 2/2] uglify while_each_pid_task() to make sure we don't count the execing pricess twice

There is a window when de_thread() switches the leader and drops tasklist_lock.
In that window do_each_pid_task(PIDTYPE_PID) finds both new and old leaders.
The problem is pretty much theoretical and probably can be ignored. Currently
the only users of do_each_pid_task(PIDTYPE_PID) are send_sigio/send_sigurg, so
they can send the signal to the same process twice.
