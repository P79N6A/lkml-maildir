90% of the help text outside arch directories are targeted at x86 users.
That said, there's a whole lot of stuff one can turn on that very much
will not work anywhere but x86.  I've raised this concern several times
and I'm always dismissed. ("x86 is all that matters.")
The proper answer is to remove the option entirely where it doesn't belong.
As such, the "depends on" needs to be updated to exclude sparc32 and sparc64.
(And MDA_CONSOLE probablly needs to go too.)
