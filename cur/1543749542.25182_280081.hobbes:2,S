The main fix IMHO is Andrea's correct solution of the invocation
including the removal of the evidential useless protection timers and
counters in out_of_memory().
The selection mechanism is now nearly matching the comment above badness
() much better: "this algorithm has been meticulously tuned to meet the
principle of least surprise ... (be careful when you change it)".
It can always be further optimized, but it will never meet the
expectation of all users
