Hmmmm.. I guess we've just been getting lucky before in that case - we've
always just left the ATM_SKB() stuff in there.
Chas - I guess you should just do a memset(skb->cb, 0, sizeof(skb->cb))
just before the netif_rx() in {clip,lec,mpc}.c and before the ppp_input()
in pppoatm.c to make sure it's zeroed correctly.
