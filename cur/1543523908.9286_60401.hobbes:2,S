Hi,
    I have a problem trying to use on old NCR53810 based controller with 
EPoX SMP Intel-LX based MoBo (2x PII 300). No matter UP or SMP kernel 
is tried. It works fine with same MoBo in W95 (so it doesn't seem to be 
a hardware conflict). And it works fine in Linux with another MoBo
(Intel-HX based Asus, P166), when there's no shared interrupts.
I've tested different kernel versions in range: 2.1.120 - 2.2.14. 
Same kernels with another MoBo work ...
The driver enters an infinite(?) loop during initialization (when there is 
no shared PCI interrupt):

... etc.
When its iterrupt is shared with another device (AIC, 3C905, S3Virge), 
the behaviour is different:
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 13, function 0
ncr53c8xx: 53c810 detected
ncr53c810-0: rev=0x01, base=0xe8001000, io_port=0x6c00, irq=16
ncr53c810-0: ID 7, Fast-10, Parity Checking
CACHE TEST FAILED: timeout.
CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED.
ncr53c810-0: detaching...
scsi : 1 host.                 <---- This is on-board AIC, which works...
Same behaviour with SMP/UP kernel, module/compiled into kernel, compiled for
i586/i686, different driver config settings, etc...
This is the device
    Non-VGA device: NCR 53c810 (rev 1).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 17.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0x6800 [0x6801].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe8000000 [0xe8000000].
Is there any chance to get it working ?
Could you, please, help me to find where the problem is ?
Regards
   Andrzej
