Yes.

well, the "or" doesn't tells me the that there is a best way. That's the

Excelent.

Adding new files into the whole source? Like it will  make a patch with 
the full content and then create the file when patching the source? 
Thanks for that one, sounds like I will need to use it.

I was just patching a README :-) and the patch looked too big and/or 
bulky, so I noticed it was using a lot of lines from the document, but I 
was only changing a single letter in a word. i.e. I changed/added 20 
letters in total, and the patch is like 200 words.
I think it's just me being a paranoid patch-newbie.
Thanks,
