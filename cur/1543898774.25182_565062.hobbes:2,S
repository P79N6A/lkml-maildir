(1) The driver will undoubtedly hold some mutex or semaphore at the 
time it checks whether a system sleep is underway.  You will have to 
drop it before blocking and then reacquire it afterward.
(2) The driver may have been called by some other routine which holds a 
mutex needed for resuming the device.  In this case the driver _can't_ 
drop the mutex and so the resume will deadlock.
Okay, I agree that (1) can be handled without too much effort.  But 
doing it adds an extra test to _every_ driver's I/O pathway.  Freezing 
userspace does not incur all this additional overhead.
(2) shouldn't arise during normal read and write operations, but it
certainly _will_ arise during probe.
