Can you beat on this patch a bit?

It just adds another priority-0 scanning pass before declaring oom.  It
works for me.
See, when redoing the 2.5 scanning code a couple of years ago I reduced the
amount of scanning which we do before declaring oom (compared with 2.4) by
quite a lot.  It was basically a "lets try this and see who complains"
exercise.
And since that time, the way in which `priority' is interpreted has
changed, which may have worsened things.
Presently we're scanning the entire active list twice and the entire
inactive list twice.  I suspect that if the inactive list is full of
referenced pages, that just isn't enough.  However it's hard to work out
what _is_ enough.  Still, it doesn't hurt to do a bit more scanning before
going off killing things, so the above seems a safe approach.
If the above still doesn't work, try replacing -1 with -2, etc.
