well, the patch was only for x86, which is fully consistent.  For parisc, that 
becomes a field for the dma accessor functions.
However, even on parisc, the (supported) machines are either entirely 
consistent or entirely inconsistent.
If you have a machine that has both consistent and inconsistent blocks, you 
need to encode that in dma_addr_t (which is a platform definable type).
The sync functions would just decode the type and either nop or perform the 
sync.
