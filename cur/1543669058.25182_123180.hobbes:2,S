Here's another example along similar lines: you can open a file
O_APPEND and pass the descriptor along to another process (e.g. a
security mediator process that hands out a file descriptor to a
less-trusted recipient that it can use for appending entries only).
fcntl() explicity prevents the clearing of the O_APPEND flag on a
file which was opened with O_APPEND. With flink, one could flink()
and re-open without O_APPEND: security hole.
