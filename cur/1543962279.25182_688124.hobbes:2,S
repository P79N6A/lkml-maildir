hm, not exactly a thing of beauty, but it could have been worse.
If we had implemeted these things properly, as
	unsigned long spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lock);
then we wouldn't be able to do this at all.
Oh well, thanks, I'll toss it in there.  Maybe this should go into
git-sched (aka git-omnibus)?
