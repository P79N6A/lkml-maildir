Here are the functions in which they occur in the object file. You
may have to chase down some inlining to find the function that
actually uses atomic_*().
freeque
do_msgrcv
sk_free
sock_wfree
sock_rfree
sock_kmalloc
sock_kfree_s
sock_setsockopt
skb_release_data
__sk_stream_mem_reclaim
sk_tream_mem_schedule
sk_stream_rfree
sk_attach_filter
ip_frag_destroy * 2
ip_frag_queue * 2
ip_frag_reasm * 2
