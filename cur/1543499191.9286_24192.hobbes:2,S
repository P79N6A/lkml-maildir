Hi Mike.

There are several ways you could go about this:
 1. /proc/cmdline gives you the label in /etc/lilo.conf that was
    used, and the following script should return the associated
    filename:
	Q> #!/bin/bash
	Q> LABEL=`sed 's/^.*BOOT_IMAGE=\([^ ]*\) .*$/\1/'`
	Q> A=`grep -n "$LABEL" | head -1 | cut -d : -f 1`
	Q> B=`head -$A /etc/lilo.conf | grep -i '^image' | tail -1`
	Q> echo $B | cut -d = -f 2-
 2. It should be a simple modifcation to the makefile to automatically
    append the relevant characters to the existing EVTRAVERSION value,
    then `uname -r` would supply the relevant text string.
 3. You could always try the following:
	Q> VSN=`uname -a | cut -d ' ' -f 3-4 | sed 's/ #/-/'`
Comments?
