Trond,
While you are running down this problem, I've located another odd 
behavior you
may (or may not) chose to address.  In my dsfs file system, I use sector 
runs (large ones)
that can sometimes return odd sizes during running down a file for 
reading. 
i.e.  I can return 4096,4096,4096,512,1024,4096,4096 block sizes on size 
returns
from vfs_read() for 512 or 4096 block requests when the file is read 
sequentially. 
Under NTFS and other OS architectures, unless the final read attempt 
returns 0 size
denoting end of file, this seems to be allowed.  I noticed that all of 
the linux code with
the exception of NFS also handles this situation quite nicely.  NFS does 
not.  I have
noted that if NFS receives a read size smaller than the requested block, 
it always assumes
end of file and terminates the next read.  I hace modified dsfs to 
always return
block sizes in a uniform manner so NFS will work properly, even though 
the rest
of the Linux apps work just fine without assuming the end of file has 
been reached. 
I personally think this is a broken behavior, but perhaps it's in line 
with some NFS
spec somewhere.  I have coded around it, but thout I would mention it to
you.
Jeff
