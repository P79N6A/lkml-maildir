I didn't.  I saw them in a test program for __builtin_expect() in the
"oops_in_progress is unlikely()" thread.
I'm used to seeing redundant "mov" instructions and such from GCC, so
when I saw the stack adjustments with -O2 go away with -Os I thought
they were more of the same - not realising that -Os turns off the stack
alignment.  My error.
