Thats their problem, they created this mess in the first place.  I can 
recall buying, years ago, things whose makers label devoted more text area 
to listing the applicable patents either pending or granted on the device 
the label was attached to than was devoted to the makers logo itself.  Now 
it probably takes whole pages of 4 pt pica text with the patent 
proliferation ad adsurdium thats taken place in the last 40 years...  Bah.  
All created to make sure the legal profession never starves.
