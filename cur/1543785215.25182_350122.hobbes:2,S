This sounds like the same problem I saw with the IA64 simscsi driver
--- the READ_CAPACITY scsi command now generates a scatterlist, and
some drivers don't cope.
I don't know whether the right fix is to change all the drivers to
understand a scatterlist, or to change sd_read_capacity() to not use 
scsi_execute_command().
