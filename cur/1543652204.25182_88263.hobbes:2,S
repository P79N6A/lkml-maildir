Yes, but init also does a kill(-1,...) to get rid of all processes,
before the last steps of system shutdown. So you have to somehow
make your "page holding" process survive beyond this point.

You make it a different problem by assuming that you'd have a
kernel that is specifically built for running at a "safe"
location. If you assume that you're just using your normal
kernel, the two problems converge again. There are still a
few things that are different, like the checksumming, but
they can safely be added at a later time.
