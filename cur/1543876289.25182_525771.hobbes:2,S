I haven't got any response from the original person who submitted this
patch.  It isn't clear to me whether this is a fix for some machine
that's in wide use, or a workaround for a prototype sitting on someone's
bench.
Andi has already accepted my more general patch which allows
intercepting the halt/reboot process in arbitrary ways (the machine_ops
patch), so that would seem to be a better way of handling this problem
if more cases arise.
