Unfortunately, not everybody has the knowledge or equipment ready to set
up a serial console... And logs in the classical sense (in a logfile...)
don't exist yet at that early stage of boot, because it happens _before_
the kernel is able to write to the filesystem...

There must be some misunderstanding somewhere. I didn't make any such
suggestion. I agree with you, such a suggestion would be nonsensical.

That would be an interesting idea, but might lead to the opposite
problem (kernel stopping _before_ the real problem happens).
Maybe what we could do is "fix" panic() such that it doesn't disable
Shift-Pgup. But I admit that such a change may not be trivial to
implement, as there may be cases where the interrupt system is fubar,
and all interrupt handlers (including keyboard) would need to be disabled.

That is a valid philosophical discussion. But shouldn't we move it to a
thread of its own?
