Hi, I'm new in the kernel programming word, so I'm having a lot of 
difficults, the first one is this:
I need to use IPC V messages in a kernel module to communicate this one with 
a daemon, but I'm not sure that my module is sending the messages ok, because 
when I use a 'ipcs -q' command I don't see any message waiting.
I'll apreciate any help
regards
elfo
