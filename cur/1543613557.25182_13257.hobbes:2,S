Judging by the interest the last patch (which wasn't announced so publically)
got, and the supportive emails I recieved, I figure there's enough
interest for me to keep this up at least until Linus is ready to resync.
(plus, Linus seems interested in me keeping this stuff in a ready-to-merge
 state, which is good enough reason as any. 8)
Patch is available from:
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/2.5/patch-2.5.1-dj1.diff.bz2
On with the changelog..
This syncs up 2.5 right up to 2.4.17rc1.
Merge a few of the more trivial "2.5 material" salvaged from the last -ac tree,
a few fixes from the kernel list, and a few other pending bits..
Some of these fixes haven't found their way back to Marcelo yet, but should
show up in 2.4.17-rc2 / 2.4.18pre1 with any luck.
