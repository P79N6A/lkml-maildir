Subject: [PATCH 1/4] fix endianness bug in l2cap_sock_listen()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/27/147

We loop through psm values, calling __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr(psm, ...)
until we get NULL; then we set ->psm of our socket to htobs(psm).
IOW, we find unused psm value and put it into our socket.  So far, so
good, but...  __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr() compares its argument with
->psm of sockets.  IOW, the entire thing works correctly only on
little-endian.  On big-endian we'll get "no socket with such psm"
on the first iteration, since we won't find a socket with ->psm == 0x1001.
We will happily conclude that 0x1001 is unused and slap htobs(0x1001)
(i.e. 0x110) into ->psm of our socket.  Of course, the next time around
the same thing will repeat and we'll just get a fsckload of sockets
with the same ->psm assigned.
Fix: pass htobs(psm) to __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr() there.  All other
callers are already passing little-endian values and all places that
store something in ->psm are storing little-endian.
