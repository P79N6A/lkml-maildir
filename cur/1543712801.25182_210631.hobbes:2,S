On modern drives how reliable is this?  At one point disk-scrubbing
software which used FUA (to ensure data was being written to the
platters) showed that some drives completely ignore this.
Has the state of things changed significantly that we can assume this
is very rare or might we need to have to kind of whitelist/blacklist
system?
