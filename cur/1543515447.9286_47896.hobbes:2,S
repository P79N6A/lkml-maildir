Did you get the boot penguin? If you have that driver compiled into the
kernel then you will have graphical console support.

Yes. You can have up to 8. I have 5 cards in my system.

First what video cards do you have in your system? Also what framebuffer
devices are you compiling into your system?  
Note the console code for linux doesn't support real multiheads. In linux
you have 32 virtual consoles. Now if you compile in more than one
framebuffer device only one of these devices are actually used for fbcon.
After you boot you have to use a utility called con2fb which maps a set of 
the VCs to the second framebuffer device. Then you have close to
multiheaded support :)
