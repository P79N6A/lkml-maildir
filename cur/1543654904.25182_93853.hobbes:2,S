No, when a video card goes to graphics mode, it's up to the driver to
program the registers.  vgacon/vga16fb only touches the standard VGA
registers (crtc[25], attr[21], seq[5], gfx[9], misc[1]). Usage is pretty
much uniform across all hardware. Any registers past those indices are
considered extended registers and usage is hardware specific.  In
graphics mode, you will probably use both the standard and the extended
registers, and disabling the VGA mode/enabling graphics mode is most
probably in one of the extended registers.

Not twice just the current mode it was in when X launched, although it
always assumes text mode.  Same thing for fbdev, it should only restore
the state when reference count becomes zero. If the framebuffer console
is loaded, the reference count will never be zero unless it is
unloaded.  If the framebuffer console is not loaded, the only time you
will save and restore the state is when some fb-based application
attempts to open/close /dev/fbx.

This is optional though.  You can still adopt the 2.4 method of always
setting the video mode.  Just take note that fbdev can be loaded without
fbcon, and if you get into graphics mode without fbcon, you just messed
up your user's console.  I think this can be avoided by munging the
configuration file (ie, always depend on fbcon and make your module
unsafe to unload).
