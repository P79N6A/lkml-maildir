Subject: [PATCH]: Handling spurious page fault for hugetlb region for 2.6.14-rc4-git5

Linus,
[PATCH]: Handle spurious page fault for hugetlb region
The hugetlb pages are currently pre-faulted.  At the time of mmap of
hugepages, we populate the new PTEs.  It is possible that HW has already cached
some of the unused PTEs internally.  These stale entries never get a chance to
be purged in existing control flow.
This patch extends the check in page fault code for hugepages.  Check if
a faulted address falls with in size for the hugetlb file backing it.  We
return VM_FAULT_MINOR for these cases (assuming that the arch specific
page-faulting code purges the stale entry for the archs that need it).
Thanks,
-rohit
