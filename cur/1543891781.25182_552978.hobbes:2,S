Thanks Mark, good idea.
Just tried and it didn't help though :(
in fact, hda gave
cu:~# hdparm -K1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting drive keep features to 1 (on)
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(keepsettings) failed: Input/output error
and in dmesg:
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xef
The drive, FWIW, is:
