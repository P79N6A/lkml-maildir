imo, asm/page.h should just go away for userspace.  the attached patch
is what i've been using in Gentoo ... but somethings (like an arch or
two in glibc) still assume asm/page.h is OK.  in general though,
considering asm/page.h has become so unreliable lately (a large number
of arches ifdef the whole thing out), most packages out there have
updated already to use the userspace interface from unistd.h.
