Your skills are misrepresenting facts, ignoring uncomfortable questions,
and shifting the blame you have to take on others. These are skills that
make you belong to the "wrong" application developers that a kernel
developer will not listen to. You demand cooperation, but you only see
it as cooperation if people do as _you_ say. You put up artificial
limits in your applications to "prove" some kernel is wrong.
Is there anyone who does not see this as some kind of campaign of yours?
