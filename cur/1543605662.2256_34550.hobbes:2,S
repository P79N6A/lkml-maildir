Speaking as a US citizen, I hope that someone outside the US will grab that info
as soon as it's available and make it accessible to everyone.  (Not that I need
it myself -- I have no interest in 2.2.20 -- but I like to see crap legislation
like the DMCA subverted wherever possible.)

Not even affected parties - the government can do it too without anyone else
and indeed even if their are contractual agreements between parties
permitting the data to be released..
I hope to have the security stuff up on a non US citizen accessible site in
time for 2.2.20 final
