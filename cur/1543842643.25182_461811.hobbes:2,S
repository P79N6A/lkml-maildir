Respectfully, With the current 2.6 development model (i.e. the lack of
a 2.7), how are we to address this kind of thing?  I'd like to see it
fixed in all new distro releases that base on 2.6.18-2.6.19, and it'll be an
individual distro decision to apply to existing releases (somewhat
unlikely).  I'm open to suggestions.  Udev rules like what opensuse
use would keep the existing names constant, as would the Red Hat
ifcfg-eth* method, so at least those distro users are OK.  We really
need this at install time to get the naming right in the first place.
