Currently, NFS exports are using device major/minor as part of the identifier 
for an exported direcory, and device numbers are going to be dynamically 
allocated in 2.7 to support hotplug, so i was wondering if there was a need 
to have some way for root to go "I know this device hotplugged in at major 3 
minor 99, but if major 53 minor 12 is free, could you change it to that?")  A 
bit like dup2, only for devices.
The discussion has moved on since then, and now it seems pretty clear that NFS 
is going to be expected to use something OTHER than device numbers, and Linus 
wants a clean break with device nodes being cookies.  Better solution all 
around, really...
But the original question did make sense.  (The answer was "no", but that's 
often the sign of a good question. :)
