I'm worried that it might be more of a mess in userspace than it  
could be
if done properly in the kernel.  Hardware drivers, especially for  
something
as critical as the BIOS, should probably be done in-kernel.  Look at the
mess that X has become, it mmaps /dev/mem and pokes at the PCI busses
directly.  I just don't want an MSI-driver to become another /dev/mem.
Cheers,
