	I think you're entirely dropping the context. If the development of 
a project is centered around a version control system, then that 
version control system contains metainformation that is useful when 
you're making modifications.
	In this case, the raw source code, less the change history and check 
in comments, would not actually be the preferred form of the source 
code for the purpose of making modifications. This has nothing to do 
with how you get the information but what information you get.
>Please stop this.  You're looking kind of silly here.
	Only because you are misrepresenting my argument.
	Let me give you a hypothetical. There's a program and you have to 
make some changes to it. Would you prefer to have the raw source code 
or the source code with change history and commit comments? I'm not 
talking about how you get either set of information, I'm talking 
about what information you get.
	Checking code out of a repository is as much an act of obfuscation 
as stripping comments.

	Any lawyer who claimed he or she could predict how a court would 
interpret this clause of the GPL is lying to you. That is why it is 
essentially impossible to be sure you comply with this.
