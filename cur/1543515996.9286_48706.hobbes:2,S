Note that an exploit was posted on bugtraq yesterday that stomps over
this patch as if it isn't there....

Well, it just crashed. That means to me it isn't stable.
The green heatsink in the middle of the board is undersized. On
certain access patterns (On my system the screensaver seemed to
trigger it), the chip overheats and causes a system hang.
I put a fan on it, and my system is a lot more stable now. I have the
thermal paste ready-to-go, which is also a good idea....
