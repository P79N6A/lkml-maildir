That box needs more changes than just the apic setup.  Unfortunately
unisys thinks they shouldn't send their patches to lkml, but when you see
them e.g. in the suse tree it's a bit understandable that they don't want
anyone to really see their mess :)
And btw, the box isn't that new, but three years ago or so when they first
showed it on cebit they even refused to talk about linux due to their
restrictive agreements with Microsoft..
