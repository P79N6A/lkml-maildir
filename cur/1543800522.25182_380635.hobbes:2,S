this is version -V10 of the generic mutex subsystem. It consists of the 
following 19 patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  add-function-typecheck.patch
  mutex-generic-asm-implementations.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-i386.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-x86_64.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-arm.patch
  mutex-arch-mutex-h.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-docs.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  sem2mutex-xfs.patch
  sem2mutex-vfs-i-sem.patch
  sem2mutex-vfs-i-sem-more.patch
  sem2mutex-simple-ones.patch
  sem2completion-sx8.patch
  sem2completion-cpu5wdt.patch
  sem2completion-ide-gendev.patch
  sem2completion-loop.patch
the patches are against 2.6.15-rc7, and they should work fine on every 
Linux architecture. They can also be downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/generic-mutex-subsystem/
i have tested all 5 mutex implementation variants under MUTEX_DEBUG_FULL 
on x86: native, -dec, -xchg, -null and debug. I have also boot-tested 
x86_64 native mutexes.
Changes since -V9:
  136 files changed, 1172 insertions(+), 1041 deletions(-)
- function-typechecking cleanup (Chuck Ebbert)
- added "From:" attribution lines. (the S-o-b lines were OK.)
- added Arjan's mass conversion which converts simple semaphore users to 
  mutexes: all the use is within a single .c file, the semaphore was 
  declared static, and all down()+up() uses are within a single 
  function. These conditions were reviewed manually, and conversion was 
  generated automatically via a script.
- semaphore to completion: CPU3WDT (Steven Rostedt)
- semaphore to completion: SX8 (Steven Rostedt)
- semaphore to completion: IDE ->gendev_rel_sem (Aleksey Makarov)
- semaphore to completion: drivers/block/loop.c
- updates to Documentation/mutex-design.txt
- added __mutex_fastpath_lock_retval to asm-x86_64/mutex.h
- converted ipc/mqueue.c and security/inode.c to ->i_mutex
- more header file cleanups
