Not too much.  I have a start of this code.  Just saving off the SRAT
locality information and using it during the add-event to decide which
node it goes to. But I went to test this weekend on a multi-node system
and the underlying __add_pages refused to add the pages.  The underlying
sparsemem can do this (It works for PPC).  I am still collecting the
debug info needed.
When I get the numa system sorted I will post patches.
