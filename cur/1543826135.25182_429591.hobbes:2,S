Having the text inline for review/comments sure would be a lot
easier on reviewers.

'buildcheck' is gone.  It is done automatically at the end of
every build.
Grammar fixes:
Some targets of note are "checkstack" and "namespacecheck".

I would add something like:
Also do not enable (y or m) Kconfig options by default.
Users should enable them and we don't want to increase kernel size
for people who don't need this.

I still disagree with that conclusion (as I also wrote on
8-Mar-2006).  I think that it's basically a matter of if the
(driver) submitter is willing to do the work as documented in
Documentation/* and listen to review feedback and act on that
or explain why changes shouldn't be made, then the code will
likely be accepted (if it's *correct*, of course).
