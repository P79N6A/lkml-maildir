Subject: [patch 00/32] 2.6.27-stable review
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.27.14 release.
There are 32 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response
to this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please
let us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and
wants to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
Note, there still are some more .28 patches pending for the -stable
releases, but I wanted to get this release out now to fix the major
problems that have recently been found.
If you have sent patches to be included in .28, and you don't see them
here, please feel free to just drop stable@kernel.org a message with the
git commit ids to make sure they end up in the next release.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc:
line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org to
add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Monday, February 2, 00:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
The whole patch series can be found in one patch at:
        kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/stable-review/patch-2.6.27.14-rc1.gz
and the diffstat can be found below.
thanks,
