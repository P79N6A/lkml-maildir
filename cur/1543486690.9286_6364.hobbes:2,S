TO whom it may concern,
     I have been trying to install a dist of linux called debian for 
awhile now on a machine.  The motherboard is a Global GCT-8IV Rev 0.5 
board with Intel Triton VX chipset among others.  It appears that there 
is a possible problem with the kernel running on this system.  I seem to 
get many sgmentation faults only after I install on to the HDD and some 
times freezes or respawns a process too fast when booting.  THe freezing 
occurs right after md is searching for hardware and many times I get the 
error 'INIT: Id '1' respawing too fast: disabled for 5 minutes.  If there 
is any other information I can provide please let me know.
Please let me help get to the bottom of this, I have even flashed my BIOS 
with the most current version of the Award BIOS on it.
Thanks
Michael Ledford
