HI,
I just upgraded to kernel 2.4.17 on a ultra2, sparc64, with 2 scsi disks.
My system was on reiserfs,except for root partition, but the kernel 2.4.17
is unable to mount reiserFS partitions.
At boot i get an oops during the mount, but sincer I have no syslogd
running I am not able to log it. Anyway the message talk about not been
able to load a table map.
gone back (sig!) to 2.4.16
on x86 processors, instead, reiserfs semms to work as usual
Luigi
