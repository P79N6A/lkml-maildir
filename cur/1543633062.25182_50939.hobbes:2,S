hi
I just got a call from my vendor, telling me my ordered configuration with 
three promise controllers were impossible, as the promise BIOS couldn't 
handle more than eight drives, no matter how many controllers you had. So.
He suggested using a card using the CMD-649 chipset (see link below). Is this 
supported in Linux? Is the CMD-648 driver able to support CMD-649?
