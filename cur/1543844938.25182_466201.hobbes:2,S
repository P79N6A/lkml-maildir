Is there any way for "git diff" to handle additional options diffstat 
handles? I'm a big fan of the -w72 diffstat option.
Oh, and with git 1.4.2.1,
  git diff -M --stat --summary v2.6.18..master
in your tree gives me some funny lines like:
 .../netlabel/draft-ietf-cipso-ipsecurity-01.txt    |  791 +
 .../{cpu_setup_power4.S => cpu_setup_ppc970.S}     |  103 
 .../powerpc/platforms}/iseries/it_exp_vpd_panel.h  |    6 
 .../powerpc/platforms}/iseries/it_lp_naca.h        |    6 
I don't know what's going wrong here, but diffstat doesn't produce this.
