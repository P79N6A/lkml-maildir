In general you should send all x86-64 patches to me. I would have
eventually merged it from i386 anyways if it was good.
But in this case it isnt. Instead of all this complexity 
just remove the NMI reassert code from the NMI handler.
It is oudated and mostly useless on modern systems anyways.
Since the NMI watchdog runs regularly even if an NMI is missed
it will be eventually handled. And even when it doesn't run
it doesn't matter much because NMI does nothing essential.
