Let me stop you there.  The kernel has had far too many contributors
submit code under "GPLv2 only" to allow it to be universally relicensed
as GPLv3, even if we _wanted_ to do that.
So the question about adoption of GPLv3 is largely irrelevant for the
kernel.
If you think otherwise, please seek expert legal advice.
