If it does (with spinlocks), then that's an implementation bug (which
might well be there).  We depend on the read-lock being recursive in a
lot of places, notably the fact that we don't disable interrupts while
holding read-locks if we know that the interrupt routines only take a
read-lock.

The writer-waiter should not be spinning with the write lock held.
Note that the blocking versions are different, and I explicitly meant
only the read-spinlocks, not read-semaphores. For the semaphores I think
your schenario is indeed correct.
