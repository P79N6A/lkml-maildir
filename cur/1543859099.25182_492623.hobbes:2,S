As much as I have in the past supported keeping useful features in the 
kernel, this one can go from 2.6 as far as I'm concerned. I would hate 
to see anyone spend any time maintaining something which is so little 
used. I can easily move the hardware to a 2.4 machine, or something 
running an early 2.6.
I think "ancient and unloved" is an apt description.
