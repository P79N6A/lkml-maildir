Given that we have contention problems updating a single mm-wide rss and
given that the way to fix that up is to spread things out a bit, it seems
wildly arbitrary to me that the way in which we choose to spread the
counter out is to stick a bit of it into each task_struct.
I'd expect that just shoving a pointer into mm_struct which points at a
dynamically allocated array[NR_CPUS] of longs would suffice.  We probably
don't even need to spread them out on cachelines - having four or eight
cpus sharing the same cacheline probably isn't going to hurt much.
At least, that'd be my first attempt.  If it's still not good enough, try
something else.
