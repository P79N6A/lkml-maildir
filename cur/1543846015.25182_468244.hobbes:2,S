Btw, it took me quite a while to realize how something like that can 
even compile. Seriously. Don't write code like that. Maybe some humans 
parse it as
	do {
		while (cond) {
			..
		}
	} while(0)
(which is the technically correct parsing and explains why it compiles 
and wors), but I suspect I'm not the only one who went "What the F*CK" 
when shown it without the "extraneous" braces.
For similar reasons, we write
	#define dummy(x) do { } while (0)
rather than the shorter
	#define dummy(x) do ; while (0)
(which some people _do_ seem to use. Aarggh!)
Or at least indent it. Or something.
I'll see if I can make git warn about "do <non-blockstatement> while ()", 
if only because I at least personally seem to have trouble parsing it.
