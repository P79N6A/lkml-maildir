Thanks for an excellent report. I can't quite see what the problem
should be yet, especially since the problems seem to start with
2.5.2-pre1 which doesn't really have a lot of interesting changes. I'll
keep looking, though. Could you do sysrq-t for a livelocked system?
The livelocks in this mail appear different than the previous ones.
Could you try running without swap?

Someone else did report a similar case. Very strange, doesn't look bio
related at all. WHat's the entire boot message for a 2.5.2-pre3 boot
attempt like the above?

2.5.1 vs 2.5.2-preX is much more interesting.
(btw, attached patch should fix your highmem oops)
