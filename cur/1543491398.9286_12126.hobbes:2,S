mb() does locked instructions:
#define mb()    __asm__ __volatile__ ("lock; addl $0,0(%%esp)": : :"memory")
and this is very well on purpose. On SMP this gets optimized on the level
of the L2 cache. (if the touched cacheline is owned by the CPU then no bus
cycles happen) On UP you are right, most systems will use the LOCK signal
to do the memory modification.
to have 'exact' get_cycles() we need both the compiler-level barrier, and
both a pre- and post- rdtsc bus-level barrier, because both preceding and
succeeding instructions can be reordered with rdtsc:

but this is an overkill for most purposes.
