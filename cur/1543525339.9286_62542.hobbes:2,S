Hi,
     I'm not trying to say that it doesn't happen, I'm certain that it 
does and that your example is a great one for showing how and when it 
can happen. Where I think we disagree is on what the root cause is 
and where is the best place to address the issue.
     I hate to reiterate, but I will; my assertion is that as long as 
the user process is permitted to generate requests faster than the 
driver can service them then it is inevitable that some request will 
take an unreasonable amount of time to be serviced. The best way to 
solve this problem is left as an exercise for the student :-).
     It need not be a case of "The driver can handle X MB/sec so give 
the other one X/2 MB/sec of requesting ability". One thought that 
comes to mind is a simple counter of outstanding requests per 
process. Once the counter exceeds some particular highwater mark the 
process is blocked from entering more requests until the counter 
drops to some lowwater mark. Hmm. ANother thought. Make the counter 
device specific. Block anyone attempting to enter a new request on 
the device once the request queue has reached a high water mark and 
resume accepting requests once a low water mark has been reached.
     It isn't terribly surprising to me that the problem seems to 
develop more with IDE than SCSI: Time spent generating requests for 
an IDE device is time that the driver cannot service those requests 
since the CPU must actively work to service the requests. Inverting 
this, ensuring that when the CPU has work to do at the device level 
that this takes priority over other activities will I think go a long 
way to addressing this priority inversion.
     Either way, it's an interesting problem, and I truly do believe 
that attacking it via mods to the elevator algorithm is merely 
putting off the inevitable whereas attacking the root cause will 
allow us to degrade much more gracefully in the face of massive I/O 
activity.
	Cheers,
	Bruce.
