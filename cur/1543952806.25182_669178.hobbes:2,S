IMO it would be worthwhile to track this down.  It's a clear indication 
that something is wrong somewhere.
Could it be connected with the way the boot kernel hands control over
to the image kernel?  Presumably ACPI isn't prepared to deal with that
sort of thing during a boot from S5.  It would have to be fooled into
thinking the two kernels were one and the same.
