A solution has come forth! Whee! :) Joe Rutledge sent me a message in 
private relating to his issues with the sil3112 and local apic. It solved
the hang issue for him and it appears to have solved it for me also as
I've run many a hdparm -tT on the drive and got upto 62MB/s each go where
as before I could run it once at the most, with the 2nd try resulting
in a hang.
Happy days. Linux doesn't hang anymore on my PC, my SATA drive does 62MB/s
thanks to libata (tons of thanks for the work on that - it did 35MB/s using
the normal IDE SATA driver) and I found a reclusive easter egg next to my
keyboard. Joy. :)
Here's the patch that Joe sent me. It doesn't apply cleanly mainly due
to formatting errors in the patch but a bit of manual fixerupping made
it all apply.
