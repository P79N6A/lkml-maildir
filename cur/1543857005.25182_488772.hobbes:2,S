I am getting stackump, but I am perhaps just blind and don't see how to 
use it to distinguish the two WARN_ONs() conveniently, besides of 
disassembling the __mutex_lock_dommon and comparing it with offset in a 
stackdump. Well, not that it's not doable, but ...

Yep, making it dependent on CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE makes sense. Andrew, 
will you take such patch? (when I also fix the evaluating-twice issue).
