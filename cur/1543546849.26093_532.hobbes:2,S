What had happened with kill()? Sorry, I don't buy that argument - "we
shouldn't leave the process in hanging state - we don't, they are not
hung - oh, but if we put a process into such situation we will have to
use signals [or sendto(), or... depending on the case in question] and
we'ld like to use close()". Kernel doesn't leave them hung. Not more than
it does on read() from the pipe where writer doesn't want to write().
Should we declare read() broken because of (while true; do; done)|grep?

SCM_RIGHTS cookies. mmap. fork(), for that matter.

Yes? Receiving process doesn't care to do recvmsg() on SCM_RIGHTS
datagram. What should happen on close(), again?
