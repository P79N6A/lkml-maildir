In the probably-not-useful department because I haven't tested on 2.5, 
my experience over a quite some time has been that you find a lot more
problems when you are actively beating on both channels.  There is some
chipset, I suspect you know which but Andre certainly does, that is just
basically busted when you use both channels.  I've had so many problems
with this that for any data I care about I plug in a 3ware controller
and use that instead.
I have a diskscrubber program which runs the bits through a series of
changes, it's pretty trivial to write but I can post mine if you like,
it works for banging on the disk.
