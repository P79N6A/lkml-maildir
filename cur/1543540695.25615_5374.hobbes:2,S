I did read the email. And I understand that. And that's exactly why I
think a single-list is equivalent (because your lists basically act simply
as "caches" of the page age).

Ehh.. Did you read _my_ mail?
Go back. Read it. Realize that your "multiple queues" is nothing more than
"cached information". They do not change _behaviour_ at all. They only
change the amount of CPU-time you need to parse it.
Your arguments do not seem to address this issue at all.
In my mailbox I have an email from you as of yesterday (or the day before)
which says:
 - I will not try to balance the current MM because it is not doable
And I don't see that your suggestion is fundamentally adding anything but
a CPU timesaver.
Basically, answer me this _simple_ question: what _behavioural_
differences do you claim multiple queues have? Ignore CPU usage for now. 
I'm claiming they are just a cache.
And you claim that the current MM cannot be balanced, but your new one
can.
Please reconcile these two things for me.
