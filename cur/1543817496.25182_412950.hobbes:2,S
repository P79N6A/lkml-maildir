Oh, those aren't the errors I'm worried about; I've had those for a  
while and they're harmless.  Those are due to the kernel running the  
IDE controller at a higher-than-supported speed.  It gets errors for  
a couple seconds and automatically drops the bus down to a lower and  
safer speed.  The cable's aren't bad, I've tried at least 6 different  
80-conductor cables that all work fine in other systems.  The errors  
I _am_ worried about are these:
