Do you view this as 2.6.12 material?

Yes, that fix seems to have been made upstream somewhere, so I'll drop that
patch.
I notice that Greg's tree changes dvb_class to be of type class_simple, so
there may be interactions between your stuff and
gregkh-01-driver-gregkh-driver-022_class-11-drivers.patch.  We'll see. 
(Warning, Greg's patch names tend to change, but it'll be something like
that).
I notice you have a lot of things like:
  Switch analog output of the Crystal sound chip to left/stereo/right mode.
  This will fix problems with some (most?) channels which do not encode 2-channel
  audio correctly. (Oliver Endriss)
In future, please try to gather Signed-off-by: lines for these
