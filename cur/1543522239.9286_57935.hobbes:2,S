This doesn't mean anything. The cache is there - just to cache things. So
if you accessed 151 files on the disk, their inodes got to cache - it's
normal behaviour.

Try what happens when you umount while the leak is more visible (you said
that it exceeds inode-max and grows to 80000). 1200 inodes is normal...
