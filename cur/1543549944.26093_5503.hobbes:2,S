Yes, it's more important, but I've looked at the assembly code that my C++
compiler generates, and it's very clean.  In fact, when you're writing code
that by design is OO, then using C++ tends to generate better code, not worse,
since the language more closely matches the design.

True, but I'm not advocating doing it for no real reason.  I'm advocating using
C++ for code that is OO by design.  My OS/2 device drivers are a mix of C and
C++, wherever appropriate.

But that applies to C code as well.  In fact, the #2 gripe I hear about Linux
development is how the API's change so often and without any regard to existing
code that depends on it.  (#1 gripe: the dearth of good development tools).

Not always true.  Some drivers, like complex PCI audio drivers, are mostly
OS-independent.  They get some data from the OS, and then spend 90% of their
code just talking to the hardware.

True, if you want to write a driver that goes into the kernel, you need to
conform to Linus' whims^H^H^H^H^Hstandards.  But considering how difficult it
is to get a driver into the kernel anyway, it often doesn't make a difference.
I don't ever expect any of my Linux drivers to make it into the kernel, and I
write them in C.

Not true in my experience.  My OO drivers have been comparble in size to their
C equivalents, and sometimes smaller because of the better code reuse that C++
promotes.

A matter of opinion.  If you have to maintain a dozen drivers of the same
class, then it may be worthwhile to write a small set of wrappers, and then do
everything in C++.  Again, this assumes that the design is OO to begin with.
