Hi. 
Our server runing use apache 1.3.6 and when the system load is high , the server
dead. I tried to kill it , and restart. the kernel reports an error:
tcp_close: socket already locked!
And then after some time, the machine hangs.
I can't figure out what is the problem.
Since our server is attacked by SYN flooding all the time.
I don't know if it's a new attack method.
Could any body help me out?
The environment: Compaq Proliant 3000 with 2 400 PII NCR53c876. 1G RAM.
                kernel 2.2.7-ac1 . Intel eepress pro 100.
I need you help . TIA.
