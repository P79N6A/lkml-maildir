Thanks for the insight, wasn't aware of the exact versions. Following
that, I've elaborated it just a bit more. What do you think?

 	'make dep' is a synonym for the long form, 'make depend'.
 
-	This command does two things.  First, it computes dependency
-	information about which .o files depend on which .h files.
-	It records this information in a top-level file named .hdepend
-	and in one file per source directory named .depend.
-
-	Second, if you have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, 'make dep'
-	computes symbol version information for all of the files that
-	export symbols (note that both resident and modular files may
-	export symbols).
-
-	If you do not enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, you only have to run
-	'make dep' once, right after the first time you configure
-	the kernel.  The .hdepend files and the .depend file are
-	independent of your configuration.
-
-	If you do enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, you must run 'make dep'
-	every time you change your configuration, because the module
-	symbol version information depends on the configuration.
+	As a visible side effect of the new kbuild system, 'make dep'
+	is no longer needed at any build stage anymore. As of version
+	2.5.60 this target has actually become obsolete.
