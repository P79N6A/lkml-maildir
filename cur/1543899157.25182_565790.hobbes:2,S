ok, why don't i leave all that in your capable hands?  typically, when
i describe a CONFIG_ prefixed variable as "dead", it's because it's
not being set *anywhere* in the tree -- not in a Kconfig file or a
header file or a source file or a Makefile.
so i'm not just checking for its existence in a Kconfig file.  i
learned that lesson.  :-)

p.s.  and i've bitched and moaned about this before, but anyone who
deliberately names their debugging variables with a "CONFIG_" prefix
*deserves* to have their builds break.  :-P
