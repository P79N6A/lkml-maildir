The __GFP_NOFAIL flag is there to mark lame-and-buggy-code which doesn't
know how to handle ENOMEM.  I went through the kernel, found all the
retry-until-it-works loops and consolidated their behaviour in the page
allocator instead.
Really we should fix them all up.  Adding new users of __GFP_NOFAIL
would not be good.
