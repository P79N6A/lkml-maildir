This is fixed.

This is also fixed.

This is basically done, except the timing code.
Current new bug list: 
- 32bit vsyscalls seem to be broken
- 32bit elf coredumps are broken
Required/Wanted features:
- need to coredump 64bit vsyscall code with dwarf2
- move 64bit signal trampolines into vsyscall code and add dwarf2 for it.
- describe kernel assembly with dwarf2 annotations for kgdb (currently waiting 
on some binutils changes for this)
