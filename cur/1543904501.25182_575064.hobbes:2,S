People have argued (claimed, rather) that swap-prefetch helps their system 
after updatedb has run -- you are doing so now.

Problem spot no. 1.
RAM intensive? If I run updatedb here, it never grows itself beyond 2M. Yes, 
two. I'm certainly willing to accept that me and my systems are possibly not 
the reference but assuming I'm _very_ special hasn't done much for me either 
in the past.
The thing updatedb does do, or at least has the potential to do, is fill 
memory with cached inodes/dentries but Linux does not swap to make room for 
caches. So why will updatedb "often cause things to be swapped out"?

Problem spot no. 2.
If updatedb filled all of RAM with inodes/dentries, that RAM is now used 
(ie, not free) and swap-prefetch wouldn't have anywhere to prefetch into so 
would _not_ have kicked in.
So what's happening? If you sit down with a copy op "top" in one terminal 
and updatedb in another, what does it show?
Rene.
