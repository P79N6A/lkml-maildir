Hi,
The following series of patches improves the handling of swap partitions
by swsusp and changes the way it writes the image to swap.  As a result,
the swap-handling part of swsusp is simplified quite a bit.
The patches in this series are also necessary for implementing the swsusp's
userland interface (coming soon).
The third patch has been acked by Pavel, but of course it depends on the
previous two.  Still, I posted them for comments some time ago and there
have not been any, so I assume there are no objections. ;-)
Please apply.
Greetings,
Rafael
