I've gotten 2.6.11-rc4 to freeze after a swsusp, so I'm testing acpi=off
now.
As Murphy's Law would have it, I usually get these lockups at 
inopportune times when I really don't want to have to punch the power 
button, like when I'm in a hurry trying to find something or during
long-running network backups.  It also does it when sitting idle, so
this isn't a rule.
I've run most of a backup from an NFS mount to the local drive (for
about 10 minutes), stopped it, swsusp, ran another backup, and it's
looking fine so far.
To be sure that it's not going to freeze, I'd almost have to let it go
for a week, though, because sometimes I had just gotten lucky and not
seen the issue for upto 4 days at a time.
Assuming disabling ACPI causes my trouble to go away, what's my next
step in debugging this issue?  I'd hate to just leave it at "Don't use
ACPI."
Thanks for your time.
