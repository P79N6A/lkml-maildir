The maintainer who is about to suffocate in newly contributed code is
actually a lucky guy:  He can ask his eager contributors to also help
with cross-reviewing and bug fixing, otherwise all the fine work will be
stuck in the clogged pipeline.  (E.g. post a subsystem todo-list now and
then, as a subtle hint.)
