[Aside: What is the purpose of the next line?
	if (f->f_mode)
	   flag++;
]
O_NONE nearly works, just the permission check at the start is broken:
	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <sys/stat.h>
	#define O_NONE 3
	int main (int argc, char ** argv)
	{
	  int fd = open (argv [1], O_NONE);
	  struct stat st;
	  read (fd, 0, 1);
	  write (fd, 0, 1);
	  fstat (fd, &st);
	  fchdir (fd);
	  fchown (fd, 0);
	  fchmod (fd, 0777);
	  close (fd);
	}
On a file with permission 600:
open("f", 0x4)                          = 3
read(3, 0, 1)                           = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
write(3, NULL, 1)                       = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
fstat(3, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
fchdir(3)                               = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
fchown(3, 0, 1)                         = -1 EPERM (Operation not
permitted)
fchmod(3, 0777)                         = 0
close(3)                                = 0
Ignore the fstat result -- it's working but strace is broken.
So fstat, fchdir, fchown and fchmod appear to be working, and read &
write are not permitted.
This is looking good!
On a file with permission 400 or 200 or 000:
open("f", 0x4)                          = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
Oh dear, you need to read _and_ write permission to open this file with
mode O_NONE.  And then you can't read or write it :-)
For completeness, a directory with mode 775:
open("tmp", 0x4)                        = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory)
Looks like the directory permissions check is confused too.  The same
thing happens with O_DIRECTORY or a trailing slash.
I expect ioctls are not properly restricted for an O_NONE file, but I
didn't try.  It wouldn't be hard to simply avoid opening the underlying
device -- thus allowing the fs-specific through to the fs.
That would fix the fs-specific flags thing once and for all, without
requiring new syscalls.  And it would be more flexible.
