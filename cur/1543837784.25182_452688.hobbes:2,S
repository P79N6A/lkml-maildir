This won't happen anytime soon (I hope the people who will inevitably
reveal it will respect my wish to keep that private). But I'm working
with Linus, Andrew and a few other developers to find a workable
alternative, such as entrusting my full identity with them.

I have done so.

This is ludicrous. I have no idea who these people are, nor any way to
reach them, nor any reason to do so (other than to ask them nicely to
release their specs properly next time and stop wasting everybody's
time). Since when do we have to ask vendor's permission to run Linux
on their hardware?!
BTW, the consensus on Google is that the accelerometer is a ADXL320 by
Analog Devices, whose specs are at [1], but the driver doesn't care or
know about this, since it's talking to the H8S embedded controller
which *drives* the accelerometer.
