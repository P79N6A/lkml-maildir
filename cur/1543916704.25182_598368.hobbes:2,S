It is, its queued as
http://git.o-hand.com/?p=linux-rpurdie-backlight;a=commitdiff;h=c962fe18c64ae9139028ee674ab3c380449ce052
Its also worth noting that corgi-bl.c has a variant (akita) that uses a
gpio over an I2C IO expander for the backlight control. The code paths
are a little convoluted since other gpios are used by other drivers. The
base driver is in arch/arm/mach-pxa/akita-ioexp.c, the set_intensity
function is in arch/arm/mach-pxa/corgi_lcd.c and the base backlight
device in arch/arm/mach-pxa/spitz.c. I will be moving the set_intensity
to spitz.c to make things a little clearer.
Also, I'm in the process of turning corgi-bl.c into a generic backlight
driver which might help you, see:
http://git.o-hand.com/?p=linux-rpurdie-backlight;a=commitdiff;h=c74f241bf53bf5251c7c10f65041c20979f6c694
Now, the GPIO framework could help too (it didn't exist when I wrote
akita-ioexp)...

Richard
