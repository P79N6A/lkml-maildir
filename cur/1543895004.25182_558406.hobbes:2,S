I just realized this was correct but slightly misleading. On powerpc, we
don't set the 'attribute((aligned(4)))' on compat_64, so there is never
a reason to handle the misalignment, even though it would work.
On x86_64, misaligned loads are always ok, so gcc never needs to
care about this, even attribute((packed)) does not cause byte access
here.
