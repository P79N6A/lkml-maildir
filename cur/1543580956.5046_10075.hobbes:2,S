I've been attempting to get two Promise Ultra66 controllers working
with an Asus P2B-F motherboard.  I've got one controller successfully
working, but as soon as I stick the second controller in the computer,
the system refuses to boot.
With 2.2.18 and the linux-ide patches (Uniform E-IDE 6.30), the
computer refuses to boot if there are no bootable drives on the
motherboard's IDE controllers.  I have 4 hard drives on the promise
ultra66, and a cdrom drive on the motherboard's controller.  I've
tried setting the BIOS IDE/SCSI first option to SCSI, and it still
doesn't work.
I moved my boot drive to the motherboard's controller, and then linux
boots, but after detecting IDE devices, it hangs just after printing:
ide1 at ...
ide2 at ...
ide3 at ...
I don't have the exact messages at hand, but can produce them...
Any ideas?  Can this work?  I've read on the Promise site that
flashing the second controller with their "dummy" BIOS may make a
difference, but I'm not sure.
