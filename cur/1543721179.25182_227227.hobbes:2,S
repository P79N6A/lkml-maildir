#   kbuild: Default kernel image defined in .config
#   
#   During kernel configuration the default kernel image is now being selected.
#   When compiling the kernel the user no longer needs to look up the
#   selected kernel imgae in either the $(ARCH) makefile or in 'make help'.
#   The more natural choice is to select the kernel image during kernel
#   the configuration.
#   The menu is located at the very top, since the other logical place
#   "general setup" did not have an opening for architecture specific
#   options.
#   The added benefit is that packaging tools now have access to the selected
#   kernel imgae, and do not have to do wild guessing based on architectures.
#   
#   This patch only converts i386, but other architectures should be easy to convert.
#   The patch is backward compatible, other architecture will not break due to this change.
