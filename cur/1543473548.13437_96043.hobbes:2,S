If I recall correctly, the NexGen guys had headed towards decoding x86
instructions into their own microcode and executing that.  Quite a similar
design to what everyone is doing nowadays with their x86 decoders on some sort
of RISC core.  NexGen had it's pros and cons though; memory access was
seriously fast on it (my NexGen-90Mhz outperformed my Intel P-120), but it did
lack in other areas.  Seems that they traded off some of the time to
enhance/perfect certain components by having other components that
outperformed most everything else.  Standard trade-off I guess.
