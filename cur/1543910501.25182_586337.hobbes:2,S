I only know that this worked in 2.6.21. I remind that previous regression was 
post-2.6.21 which obviously implies that it did work ...
For reference I attach dmesg from 2.6.21. I do not see any ttyS3 there ...

This worked in 2.6.22 with the same quirks. I will test without later but I 
fail to see how they are related.

This worked in 2.6.21 and 2.6.22 (and earlier BTW). So if you just had revert 
to 2.6.21 it would have worked. Something else changed.
