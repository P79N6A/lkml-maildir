Interesting. Slab internally uses lots of large per-cpu arrays. 
Alltogether something like around 40 kB/cpu. Right now implemented with 
NR_CPUs pointers. In the long run I'll try to switch to your allocator.
But back to the patch that started this thread: Do you still need the 
ability to set an explicit alignment for slab allocations? If yes, then 
I'd polish my patch, double check all kmem_cache_create callers and then 
send the patch to akpm. Otherwise I'd wait - the patch is not a bugfix.
