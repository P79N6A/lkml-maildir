Yes, I tried a compilation with MULTIQUAD on.
The "very recent" might be that I'm talking about -ac (look at the
Subject).

First of all:
I noticed this problem while doing a compile-only test, I have no real
knowledge of the code.
In 2.4.20-pre the following change was made in several places:
  clustered_apic_mode -> (clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_NUMAQ)
In 2.4.20-pre-ac they were changed again, this time
  (clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_NUMAQ) -> clustered_apic_logical
According to grep the occurence of CLUSTERED_APIC_NUMAQ my patch changes
was the last one _in the whole kernel sources of 2.4.20-rc4-ac1_.
It might be that my patch is wrong but there's undoubtable something
that needs to be fixed.
