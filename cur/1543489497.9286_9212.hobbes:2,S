That spam...    Surprisingly I have machinery ready to block this
particular type from getting thru (
http://maps.vix.com/dul/
), but
it hasn't been activated at VGER yet. See that "Received:" header
below.
The snafu is that if people use dialup services and then send out
email directly from their machine (instead of thru their ISP's
smtp relay), they would become blocked.  :-|   What a difficult
choice...
