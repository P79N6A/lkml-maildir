They are not the same in general - if kevent is ready immediately, there 
will not be its removing from kevent tree, but current kevent server has 
it always not-immediately for lighttpd tests - so functions are the same:
open()
sendfile()
cork_off
close(fd)
close(s)
remove_event_from_the_kernel
with the same parameters.
