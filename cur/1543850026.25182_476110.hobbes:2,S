We don't set VM_EXIT_ACK_INTR_ON_EXIT on the VM exit controls, so when 
an external interrupt is received, it isn't acked and remains in the 
(real) apic.  We do set the guest to exit on external interrupt, so the 
guest exits and when it reaches the popf in kvm_dev_ioctl_run() the 
interrupt is dispatched naturally using the host IDT.
[Xen can't do that since it must handle some of the interrupts itself]

That's in the guest, right?  I get those too.  Probably due to to our 
shadow mmu suckiness or a problem with the virtual apic.  We are 
addressing both.

Hmm.  What guest are you using?  Are you using dhcp? ipv6? qemu user net 
or tap?

I have a project queued on sourceforge, should be up in a day or two.
Thanks for testing!
