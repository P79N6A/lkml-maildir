Yes, only if you don't have a PCI bus.
The code is simple here and I cannot see an error:
                if (!pci_present()) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR "Diva: no PCI bus present\n");
                        return(0);
                }
pci.h:
#define pci_present pcibios_present
...
#ifndef CONFIG_PCI
/* If the system does not have PCI, clearly these return errors.  Define
   these as simple inline functions to avoid hair in drivers.  */
extern inline int pcibios_present(void) { return 0; }
Only idea:
Your installed kernel was not compiled with CONFIG_PCI.
