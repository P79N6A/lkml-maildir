I just rebuilt color-ls so it doesn't DEFAULT to color. The original
defaulted to the essential equivalent of "color=on". This meant
that if the environment wasn't consulted, apparently what is happening
in my version of make when it forks the second-level shell, the
color will be on, even when piped or redirected.
Nevertheless, I suggest that there may be problems in the future
reported when external tools are used to replace built-ins.
There are better ways of patching the makefile than what I did.
In fact, you can get rid of the redirection to the temporary file
altogher. I just replaced 'ls' without actually trying to improve
anything.
Cheers,
