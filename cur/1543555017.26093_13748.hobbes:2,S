I'm starting to suspect that it's really a combination of three things: 
 - 3dnow optimization (ie you have to compile the kernel with Athlon
   support)
 - pending, but not yet noticed, FPU exceptions.
 - a bug/feature in the kernel, where a process exit does not bother to
   clear the FPU, only marks it as "unused".
If I'm right, the proper test-program should be something like
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	        asm("fldcw %0": :"m" (0));
	        asm("fldz ; fld1 ; fdiv");
		sleep(1);
	        return 0;
	}
where it's important that we do not wait for the result of the fdiv, we
just exit after having caused a pending exception (and you cannot do this 
reliably from C code - depending on compiler version and optimizations
gcc may try to write the bad value back to memory etc). 
Now, with the pending exception, do a 3dnow MMX memcpy() - which will
clear the TS bit (because it decides that the FP state can be thrown
away and doesn't need to do a full save/restore) and start using the FPU.
Boom. Instant FP exception. With the exception handler deciding that
nobody owns the FP state, and thus doing nothing sane.
If I'm right (and I'm _always_ right), the following patch would make a
difference.
Markus?
