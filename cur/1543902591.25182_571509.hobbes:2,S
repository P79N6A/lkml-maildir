there's a difference between 'often' and 'always'. I really don't think 
you want to start that sort of argument (after all, would you like it if 
the MPAA argued "dvd burners are often used to make pirate copies, let's 
make it so that they won't burn anything without being given a special 
key"?)
and arguing that the LSM is only used by out-of-tree modules and then 
strenuously opposing mergeing of such modules means that one of your 
arguments is bogus
