Thanks.  I've taken a look at it and have become puzzled.
It looks as though ide_ack_intr normally just "returns" 1 and has no
other effect.  But then I see some ide drivers that also have an ack_intr
routine.  On some (most?) architechtures, it would appear that the ack_intr
routine is not used, since the ide_ack_intr macro will not call it.
In gayle_ack_intr_a4000(), it looks as though all it does is read a
register and return something.  Is that register read supposed to clear
interrupt as a side effect.
So maybe an explicit clear is not needed on most implementations?
