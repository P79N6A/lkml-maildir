Theodore, 
I agree with you that most often the number of files increases more
slowly than the size of the filesystem, but there are cases where
this isn't true.
News is the one example that everybody knows.
If you are logging data to a disk, and have decided (maybe 10 years
ago) to put every measurement in a separate file, you'll get lots of
files, now that you can afford that 9G disk. 
It is often very "unacceptable" to run out of inodes: you get "disk
full" errors, but df just reports lots of free space.
I think you can print a warning if your "new guidelines" aren't
followed, but I don't think you should force your new guidlines on
everybody. (well, we're talking about changing the default. But nobody
ever changes the default....)
