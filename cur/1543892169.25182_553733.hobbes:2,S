If you have an ACPI PM timer in your system (and if you have SMM then your
system is almost certainly modern enough to have one) then surely the
problem is fixed for all practical purposes? The problem was overflow of a
fixed-width platform counter. The PIT wraps every ~50ms, but the ACPI PM
timer will wrap only every ~4s. It would be quite unreasonable for SMM to
take the CPU away for multiple seconds, even as a one-time boot operation.
