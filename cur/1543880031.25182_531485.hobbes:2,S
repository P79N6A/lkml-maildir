The license that protects the code we write is far from nonsense.
I know. In the end, this is the reason this topic is being discussed.
I suggest the first thing you do is contact the ZFS developers and
convince them to release their code under a license that's GPL
compatible, then we can start looking at a Linux port.
I began by contacting them. One of the devs there told me to contact the  
Linux devs.

Yes, but it is not really for the end-user. To paraphrase another, it is  
mostly academic.

You make up a member of the Linux community.

For the greater glory of Linux? :-)
