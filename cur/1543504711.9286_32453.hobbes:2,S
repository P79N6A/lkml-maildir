This kind of problem happens with all filesystems which are not a simple
UFS-like filesystems but have addtional data which are not saved using
traditional backup programs (i.e. tar, cpio, etc). 
One solution is to really add one general ioctl to access these additional
properties on a per-file basis independent of the underlying file system.
Such properties might be the short name for VFAT or lsattr attributes for
EXT2 or even ACLs and attributes for NTFS. 
This way, a backup program can ask for additional data for each file
without knowing the detail on the filesystem, the only real problem is
that the properties are not portable across different filesystems.
However, there should always be the option to ignore these properties
during a restore...
