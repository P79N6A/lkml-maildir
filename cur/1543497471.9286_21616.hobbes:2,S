AFAIK, from debugging the thing when it was first noticed, it has
nothing to do with Glibc and everything to do with assuming a process
can write & read a pipe without deadlock.  Which is great unless you try
to stuff >4k bytes into the pipe -- then the write blocks and Netscape
freezes.
Turning off Java and Javascript fixes the problem for me.
