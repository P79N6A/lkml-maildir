The user referencing non-present memory is not a problem, because:
1. It is always pssoible to block the user process and let it wait
   (a long time) for swapping to happen. That might not be an
   option for the kernel - it can't wait while holding a
   spinlock, for example.
2. It is always ok to kill the user process if it uses memory it
   doesn't have.  It is not ok to "kill" the kernel.  The indirect ways
   of using user memory from the kernel side ensures that the
   normal mechanisms (swap-wait or kill) applies to the process owning
   the memory.  Direct reference from kernel does not invoke normal page 
   fault mechanisms when memory goes wrong.
