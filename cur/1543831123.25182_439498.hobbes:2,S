But that is using cpu_clk_unhalted (isn't it?)  If so, it would slow down
when the system is idle.
The BIOS writer's guide, Ch. 10.2, says only events outside of the
processor, like northbridge DMA accesses, stop counting during halt.
(And by definition cpu_clk_unhalted.)

$ pfmon --smpl-module=inst-hist --smpl-show-function --smpl-show-top=40 \
  -ecpu_clk_unhalted -k --long-smpl-period=10000 --resolve-addr --system-wide -t 10
only kernel symbols are resolved in system-wide mode

I'm pretty sure. :)  Looking at that pile of code in acpi_processor_idle
and the way it disables interrupts I think I'll switch to idle=halt, though.

In that case it's all Stephane's fault: he wrote the code!
