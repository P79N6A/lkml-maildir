I'll argue that point, although it's been hashed to death on the SPAM-L
and spamtools mailing lists. In the end, no matter what any of us say,
it's Matti's call.

And how do you handle delivery deferrals on your temporary link? Or do you
just hope that the remote end doesn't ask you to redeliver later?
You're asking for problems here. Try delivering to hotmail on the first
try, and you'll see why.

Speculation. It's easy enough to measure if you're really worried about
it; check the headers from messages posted to the list.
Dan Bernstein's favorite line applies: profile, don't speculate. (No
offense, Matti...;-)

Ah yes. Of course, since the gateway is probably your ISP, they could just
sniff -EVERYTHING- coming from you. Or any of the potentially hundreds of
other uncontrolled networks between you and the remote end.
If you want secure email, encrypt your message. This is a non-argument.

PLEASE, yes. NANOG uses this scheme, and it's rather effective. It also
allows you to post from multiple addresses without needing to subject all
of them to the l-k volume, solving the "but I post from multiple
addresses!" problem nicely. ;-)
