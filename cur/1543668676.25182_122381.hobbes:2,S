Use spin_lock_irq(&uidhash_lock) or you will deadlock if you hold it
while you take a timer tick, but it's wrong anyway. it's O(N) with
respect to number of users present. An O(1) algorithm could easily
make use of reference counts held by tasks.

This isn't right, when expiration happens needs to be tracked by both
user and task. Basically which tasks are penalized when the user
expiration happens? The prediction is the same set of tasks will always
be the target of the penalty.
