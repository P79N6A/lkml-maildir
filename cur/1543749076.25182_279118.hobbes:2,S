Hi,
2.6.10-rc3-mm1 patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3-mm1/cfq-time-slices-13-2.6.10-rc3-mm1.gz
2.6-BK patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3/cfq-time-slices-13.gz
Changes:
- Fixup the RCU usage. Also uncovered a bug if the process exiting was
  active on several disks, only the first would get kicked.
- Fix problem with CFQ as default at boot for IDE. IDE asks for the same
  request several times, this disturbed the CFQ max_depth logic. Check
  if a request is already in flight and allow it.
