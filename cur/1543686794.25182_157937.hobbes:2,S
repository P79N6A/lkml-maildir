Doesn't here.  Example:
[root@coyote root]# dmesg -s 30000 >/tmp/dmesg;ls -l /tmp/dmesg
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        15496 Aug 16 10:57 /tmp/dmesg
And actually starts up in the middle of the usb stuffs because of the 
size limitation.
Here is a head of the file itself after this last boot.
: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub
host/usb-uhci.c: $Revision: 1.275 $ time 13:51:40 Aug 15 2003
host/usb-uhci.c: High bandwidth mode enabled
host/usb-uhci.c: USB UHCI at I/O 0xdc00, IRQ 9
host/usb-uhci.c: Detected 2 ports
usb.c: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
etc, etc
Besides, used that way its a read option, and I'm asking about the 
size of the ring being used during the boot for message storage 
before any drives are mounted in writable modes.  Its many kilobytes 
insufficient, and because of pointer wrap, being overwritten before 
the syslog is up and running, and the file 'dmesg' itself is actually 
written to non-volatile storage.
Adjusting this is not an 'after boot' operation as above, but a 
src-code setting buried in the kernel code someplace.  I have NDI how 
interlocked it is with everything else, which is why I was hopeing 
someone could point me and pull the trigger.
