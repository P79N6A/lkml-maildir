The issue comes down to a very simple question:
  Are you using handle_simple_irq() with an interrupt which can be masked?
If the answer to that question is 'yes' then you're using the wrong handler.
If 'no' then it's the right handler and the mask/unmask methods associated
with the interrupt will be no-ops.
Therefore, if you have mask/unmask methods for a simple IRQ which actually
do something, clearly the first answer is the one which applies.  You're
using the wrong handler.  Use the level or edge handlers instead.
