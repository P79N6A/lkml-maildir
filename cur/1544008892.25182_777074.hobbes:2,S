Sorry, but I don't understand the "does not qualify for this work" part.
Can you please rephrase ?

| This is no simplification. This are more constraints.
Yes cinit ignoring SIG_DFL exit signals from parent-ns is a constraint.
So if we run say sshd as container-init, we can't use SIGINT to
terminate it, but need SIGKILL 
The question is whether this constraint makes any serious/real cinits
unusable ?
The behavior at present is that cinits can be terminated from within
and cinits cannot do anything in user-space. With this incremental
step at least user space has an option of ignoring such signals.
