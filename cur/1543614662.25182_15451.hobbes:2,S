Yup, Linus told this in a recent thread (this one?), and Al seems still not
interested in having his name there, its his right, but the fact is that he
_is_ the one doing maintainance for the VFS, so I don't think that putting
his name there would be something bad for him or whatever, but hey, if
Linus isn't authoritarian wrt this and Al doesn't want to have his name
listed there, what can we do? Ditto for other de-facto maintainers that are
not listed there.
And BTW, a janitor did something like: look at maintainers? nothing there?
send a message to all the addresses in the source file touched, what did he
got? some responses, yes, but _tons_ of bounces...
