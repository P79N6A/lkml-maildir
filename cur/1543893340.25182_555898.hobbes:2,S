Having just got my first Sun box (one of those 48 disk Thumper machines)
I can say it's very interesting in practice too.  The admin tools for
zfs are a dream to use (unlike just about everything else on Solaris
which is a bugwards compatible nightmare to use) and the attitude of
checksumming everything on to disk and checking that those checksums
match on the way back out presses my "do your own safety checking and
don't trust the hardware" buttons very much the right way - especially
with that much hardware in there.
I would love to see Sun GPL3 OpenSolaris, not so much for the code
itself (maybe not portable into Linux) but for the clarity it would
give to the patent position.  The patent peace would be portable back
to GPL2.
