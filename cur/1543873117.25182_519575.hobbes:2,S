the container code has quite a number of locks, including
the container(_manage)_lock/unlock, but those should not
hurt that much, as restructuring is not on the hot path
(as far as I can tell)
but I was more referring to the charge/uncharge(_locked)
inlines which will be execised quite often ...
and btw, why not use a 'generic' accounting macro/inline
to do the accounting for all the different resources like
files, rss, sockets (instead of duplicating the code
over and over again)
that would really simplify improving the accounting by
switching to atomics or even per cpu based mechanisms
best,
Herbert
