* Pending Finalize new device naming convention (Linus Torvalds)
Is this about user space visible device names , like the stuff in /dev/ ?
I have some strong ( negative ) feeling about the current ( pre 2.5.x ) state
of that. Where is/was/will be this discussed.
The gist of my problem is that the entries in /dev/ doesn't always refer
to the same device as 5 minutes before. Even without a reboot in between.
Examples : 
name      |    now             | some minutes later
-------------------------------------------------
sdb       | a SCSI disk        | some other SCSI disk
hda6      | my root FS         | my swap partition
dsp1      | my main speakers   | my rear speaker
eth0      | my LAN connection  | my ISP connection
There must be some lasting ID that can be used to refer to devices,
something that is not changed by some semi-related events.
