The actual thread was about multiple NIC's that were ON THE SAME
SUBNET as far as the IP address allocated to them was concerned. In
that context, the above is about the only use for that arrangement
that I've ever come across.
I would agree that all of the suggestions you made are valid uses for
two NIC's on the same wire, but in different subnets though.
