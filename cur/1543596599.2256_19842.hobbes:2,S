Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.7-pre3 kernel_stat -> cpu_stat[NR_CPUS]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/7/6/105

This patch does the following:
- creates a cacheline aligned/padded struct cpu_stat[NR_CPUS].  
- moves the [NR_CPUS] members of kernel_stat into cpu_stat
This moves the stat data that a cpu will update into a contiguous region.
Previous users of kernel_stat would compete for an array's cacheline
with other cpus.
- creates /proc/cpu/[0-9]+/ and fs/proc/proc_cpu.c with code for managing
  files in the cpu's directories.
This should be useful for rusty's */active and arjan/rmk's */frequency.
I have no strong feelings about where this lives or what it should be
named.
- adds collection of fault statistics and adds 'context migration'
  recording, per cpu.
- updates users of kernel_stat in proc, reports shouldn't change
- updates every friggin' user of kstat.irqs[] in arch/ with a macro so
  that we never have to do this again.
The patch is rather large, due to that last bit.  It can be found at

I'd like to get this sent to Linus soon, but wanted to run the
/proc/cpu/* stuff by l-k one last time.
