I tried that, but there's still no way of getting a pointer to the ud2a
instruction in there.  gcc just generates garbage if you try to use use
the &&label syntax on a label which isn't (potentially) the target of a
goto (it just gets placed somewhere random).
But there's a bigger problem than that.  If the BUG is in code which can
be replicated (ie inlined or unrolled), then it would also require
replicating the static variable...
