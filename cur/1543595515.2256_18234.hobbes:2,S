The fix wasn't intended for VC switch, but for any change of
fb_var_screeninfo parameter. Those can happen without VC switching,
that's exactly what 'fbset' is for.
If on your console you do a 'fbset -depth 16 -rgba 5,6,5,0' followed by
a 'fbset -depth 16 -rgba 5,5,5,1' [1], any driver using fbdev will end
up with a crazy colormap because it hasn't been reinstalled after the
RGBA change.
Hence the need for the fix.
[1] yes, in fbset, "-depth" really mean "-bpp" ...
