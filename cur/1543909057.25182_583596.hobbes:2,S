Agreed that the system is broken, however lowering the throttle limit 
gives no improvement in this case.
This is not theoretical, but a testable, repeatable result.  
Instructions to reproduce should show up tomorrow.
This bug is now solved in a kludgy way.  Now, Peter's patch set offers a 
much cleaner way to fix this little problem, along with at least one 
other nasty that it already fixed.
