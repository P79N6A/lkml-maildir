On the ia-64, they do indeed use a HZ value of 1000 by default.
And I've had some Intel people grumble about it, because it apparently
means that the timer tick takes anything from 2% to an extreme of 10%
(!!) of the CPU time under certain loads.
Apparently the 10% is due to cache/tlb intensive loads, and as a result
the interrupt handler just missing in the caches a lot, but still:
that's exactly the kind of load that you want to buy an ia64 for. 
There's no point in saying that "the timer interrupt takes only 0.5% of
an idle CPU", if it takes a much larger chunk out of a busy one. 
So the argument that a kHz timer takes a noticeable amount of CPU power
seems to be still true today - even with the "architecture of tomorrow". 
Yeah, I wouldn't have believed it myself, but there it is..  You only
get the gigaHz speeds if you hit in the cache - when you miss, you start
crawling (everything is relative, of course: the crawl of today is a
rather rapid one by 6502 standards ;)
