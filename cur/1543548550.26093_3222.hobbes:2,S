Hello friends,
I would like to have suggestions for a fixed memory address into which
a large object can (usually) be mmap(MAP_FIXED)'d safely on various
architectures.
On i386 I'm using 0x60000000, which is (by and large) safely out of
the way of libraries (grow up from 0x40000000) and the stack (grows
down from 0xc0000000 or 0x80000000 depending on version and compile
options).
So, what are good values to use for other architectures?
Thanks,
	-hpa
