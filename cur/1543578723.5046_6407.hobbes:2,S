598 + 586b

Windows driver compatibility, so that VP3 drivers would work on MVP3 as
well.

This doesn't do anything but change the ID so that Linux drivers are not
confused anymore. This caused a lot of trouble in 2.2, especially with
the old VIA IDE driver.

Actually, the definitions of what's a 'true VIA xxx chipset' change over
time, as VIA upgrades the southbridges in the specs. You'll now fing
that the VPX chipset is 587vpx + 586b, but when released the 587vpx was
coupled with the old 586 south.
Fortunately all these chips use PIIX-compatible extensions to the PCI
bus, so they are all interchangeable to some degree.

It's possible. I have a board (VA-503A), which has a masqueraded 598,
which identifies itself as 597, and a 686a southbridge. This got the
2.2 ide driver completely confused, for example.
