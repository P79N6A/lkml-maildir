I was under the impression, that on the x86 processors, it is not
possible to have more than ~640Kb of 'unswappable' memory. Everything
else *is* swappable.
Perhaps somebody with understanding could enlighten us on this point?
Is kernel code swappable if compiled in statically? I have assumed
that it is.
