BTW, this isn't the first time that he has been encouraged to consider
extending SELinux rather than going it alone with his own custom LSM,
and the benefits to him would be:
- leveraging an existing code base and infrastructure that is already
upstream and included in several distros (including both the kernel code
as well as integration with userspace, policy tools, policy management
infrastructure, etc),
- being able to leverage the existing TE security model to complement
and fill in the gaps left by the low water mark model, just as it is
already being used to complement MLS,
- ensuring that the result integrates well and works well with SELinux,
for those who may want both low water mark and TE.
