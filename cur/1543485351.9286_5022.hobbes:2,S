	The criteria is not 'rm', like has been said here
	earlier, the criteria is loosing the last reference
	to the given file.
	Lets say, we have a large directory with lots of files
	to clean up, if each reference loss would cause a new
	thread to be created without bounds, we would soon have
	thousands of threads doing the deletes.
	Even if such a thing would give fast response speeds,
	there must be some limit at how many of them can be
	running at the same time.
	As the cleanups of small files would happen faster than
	cleanups of large files, thus presuming the count of large
	files to be deleted to be fairly small, one can guess that
	a limit around 10-20 deleter threads would be all what the
	doctor ordered.  If the limit is exceeded, deleter blocks
	until the count comes down again (and then starts a new
	thread, and increments the count..)
	Would you write it ?   It should be a general VFS-layer thing.
