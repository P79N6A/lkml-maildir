This serie of patches unify the X86 Kconfig files.
Next step is to enable use of "make ARCH=x86" and kill
"make ARCH=i386/x86_64".
But that will wait till tomorrow.
The allmodconfig kernel is still building here.
Testing / reviews appreciated.
Comments from former patchset is addressed - see
changelog entries.
