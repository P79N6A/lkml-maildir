Is it though? Does this fix an error?
The thing is, we make a function call inside of the loop:
	/* wait to be given the lock */
	for (;;) {
		if (!waiter->flags)
			break;
		schedule();
		set_task_state(tsk, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	}
Which might preclude that need. I'm not entirely sure, though... it's one of
those compiler black magic things.
I suppose it can't hurt...
