a few comments
1) jiffies are 64 bit not 32
2) jiffies are not a constant time, eg HZ is a config option,
   exposing that internal counter to userspace sounds wrong, after
   all what would it be used for
3) wouldn't it be better to expose a wallclock time thing which
   has a constant unit of time between all kernels?
(and.. wait.. isn't that called gettimeofday() )
