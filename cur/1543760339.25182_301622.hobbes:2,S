I've written a dm-crypt patch some weeks ago that does what you
describe. The crypto information (cipher and key) is added to a keyring
and then the device is constructed using a reference to this key.
I had some issues with the keyring code (mainly a deadlock problem with
crypto module autoloading):

I would also like to switch dm-crypt to acrypto once it's accepted into
the kernel.
