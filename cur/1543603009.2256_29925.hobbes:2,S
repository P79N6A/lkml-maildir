This actually looks like a fix.  Ext2 keeps a directory entry named
.. in the directory so it knows what the parent directory is.
So to rename a directory besides it must unlink(..) and the link(..) inside
the directory being moved, at least logically.  In the case you gave
as the parent directory didn't change it could be optimized out, but
it probably isn't worth it. 
I know this is different but why is this a problem?
