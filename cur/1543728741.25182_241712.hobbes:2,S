Make sure to have some sort of offset for the static interleaving that
is random or semi-random for each inode, as we discussed on linux-mm last
week.  Otherwise you'll end up with pages for small files clustered on
a few nodes, as the offset into the inode will never exceed some small
value.
And even though I know Andi doesn't care for a dynamic counter, this
last week I implemented a new MPOL_ROUNDROBIN using just such a counter.
The only significant difference from MPOL_INTERLEAVE is the use of a
per-task dynamic counter rather than an index based on offsets into a
vma and/or inode.  It seems to work quite well in my testing.  My next
step was going to be using this policy for tmpfs file allocations by
default (overridable by mbind()).  Does anyone think this idea has
merit?  If so I'll clean up the MPOL_ROUNDROBiN patch and post it,
then follow it by a tmpfs patch sometime soon (I'm just beginning
work on it).
Thanks,
Brent
