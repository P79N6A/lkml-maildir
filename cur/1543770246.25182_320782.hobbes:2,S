Can you please retest 2.6.12-rc5, see if this bug is still there?
Thanks.

Hi Andrew,
partial success:
when changing mouse resume from hibernation works
when hibernate with BT dongle in HCI mode and then starts with it (allways 
starts in HIDproxy mode acting as USB mouse and keyboard) kernel still 
freezes after reading 100% of memory from swap.
After reset kernel doesn't attempts to read memory from swap again and so 
memory is lost :(
Other problem is that after hibernate GL application never works anymore
testet x.org with i915 module and xfree-4.3.0 with i830 module:
