Yes, I think the idea is that the DRM uses that to prevent signals to be
delivered to the task that is blocking them with the notifier (I have no
idea why they can't use the normal block mecanism for that... looks like
a hack to me).
So I suppose it's fine, as long as you add a test of tsk == current to
avoid calling it.
