	Yes, the kernel cannot bypass the TSS entirely.

	In Linxu , the SS and DS normally holds the same value. Mostly I
have seen that,\
 when in kernel mode, DS=SS=0x18 and when in user mode DS=SS=0x28 
(this is what i remember !). 
As Linux does not believe in x86 processor recommended task switching (ie
storing/retrieving all the
necessary register values in a TSS) it uses the process's stack to hold the
required registers. 
But, it cannot get away from the fact that, when a switch happens to kernel
mode,
 the processor expects to find the SS and ESP values for that privilege
level in the current TSS
 (the one which i pointed to be the TS register if i am correct!).
In Linux, we have only one TSS per processor, and when a process is
scheduled most 
probably the kernel sets the  TSS's SS0 (SS corresponding to ring 0) as 0x18
and ESP0 
will be current process's task_struct + 8K (in 2.4). Again, I have not
really gone through
 that piece of code in the kernel, so this is my assumption. Correct me if I
am wrong.
