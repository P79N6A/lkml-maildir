Changelog says:
ChangeSet 1.1150 2003/08/14 11:11:39 torvalds@home.osdl.org
  Mark CLONE_DETACHED as being irrelevant: it must match CLONE_THREAD.
  CLONE_THREAD without CLONE_DETACHED will now return -EINVAL, and
  for a while we will warn about anything that uses it (there are no
  known users, but this will help pinpoint any problems if somebody
  used to care about the invalid combination).
It has been five months; I'd say we could lose it now.  Linus?
