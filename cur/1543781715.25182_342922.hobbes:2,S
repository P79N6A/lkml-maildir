Or does this system have a serial?  This is just as good (if not better)
than netconsole, since it is simpler, and netconsole still needs to use
the IP stack.  Although, in most cases netconsole works for me. But with
a serial, you can also send commands.  Netconsole is better if you need
to send lots of data, and need a higher speed data transfer rate.
I usually set up a minicom attached to the target computer, and on the
target run "cat /dev/ttyS0 > /dev/null &" just to open a port. This is
needed, since the reading of the serial will only be done if something
is actually reading from it.  On the kernel command line you will also
need to add, console=ttyS0,115200N8 (change the baud to whatever, since
here I use 115200).  From minicom, you can send a sysrq-t with C-a f t.
The C-a f sends a break, and the t tells the kernel this is a sysrq-t.
Read Documentation/serial-console.txt for more information.
For netconsole read: Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt

Also have a look at Ingo Molnar's RT patch. It takes care of priority
inversion (with priority inheritance) and also has lots of other nifty
features to debug semaphores and locks.
