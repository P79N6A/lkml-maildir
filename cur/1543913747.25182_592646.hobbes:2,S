Well, if you insist on having it again:
Waiting for atomic value to be zero:
        while (atomic_read(&x))
                continue;
gcc may happily convert it into:
        reg = atomic_read(&x);
        while (reg)
                continue;
Expecting every driver writer to remember that atomic_read is not in fact
a "read from memory" is naive. That won't happen. Face it, majority of
driver authors are a bit less talented than Ingo Molnar or Arjan van de Ven ;)
The name of the macro is saying that it's a read.
We are confusing users here.
It's doubly confusing that cpy_relax(), which says _nothing_ about barriers
in its name, is actually a barrier you need to insert here.
