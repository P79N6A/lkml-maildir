in this particular case we can clearly separate the two workloads 
though: CPU-overload (Ken's benchmark) vs. half-load (3-task tbench). So 
by checking for migration target/source idleness we can have a hard 
separator for wakeup balancing. (whether it works out for both types of 
workloads remains to be seen)
