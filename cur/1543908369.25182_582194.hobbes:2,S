An EBDA is an optional BIOS feature so providing you virtualise the
relevant entry in the zero page (to avoid guest applications trying to
scan the EBDA for some system tables they may want to use like DMI) as
a zero entry you can ignore the EBDA.
That probably the right thing to do since the host EBDA won't match the
guest environment and the guest might migrate anyway
