We've got io error fault tolerance that needs to go in after the barrier
code has stabilized.  I can't promise that I'll never making another
change in there, but my goal is to keep them to a minimum.

Some benchmarks have been posted on reiserfs-list, but I'd love to
coordinate with you on getting some mongo numbers.  I can spout off a
long list of places where the code does better then the original v3
allocator, but that's because those were the ones I was trying to fix
;-)

A good start would be to just rebenchmark against v4.
