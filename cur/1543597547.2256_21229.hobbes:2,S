  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Hmm. Don't decare it again.
funct()
{
    size_t ticks;
    wait_queue_head_t wqhead;
    init_waitqueue_head(&wqhead);
    ticks = 1 * HZ;        /* For 1 second */
    while((ticks = interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&wqhead, ticks)) > 0)
                  ;
}
That'd oughtta do it. You can skip the loop if you can stand a short
timeout.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
