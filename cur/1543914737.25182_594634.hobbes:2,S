I repeat to be totally against this.
(1) You are trying to add pr_*(fmt, arg) as a lazy shorthand for 
printk(KERN_* fmt, arg...) and
(2) do not seem to notice that pr_debug() changes its behavior 
depending on -DDEBUG, which pr_alert() etc. do not, so there
is IMHO no point (that includes the already existing pr_info()).
Why not just obsolete printk() altogether then?
