The performance risk is that someone will do lock_page() against a page
whose IO is queued-but-not-yet-kicked-off.  We'll go to sleep with no IO
submitted until kblockd or someone else kicks off the IO for us.
Try disabling kblockd completely, see what effect that has on performance.

What this means is that it is not legal to run lock_page() against a
pagecache page if you don't have a ref on the inode.
iirc the main (only?) offender here is direct-io reads into MAP_SHARED
pagecache.  (And similar things, like infiniband and nfs-direct).
