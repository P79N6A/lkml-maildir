I don't think the current sp value is very interesting really.
What that code is trying to do is to tell you the minimum amount of stack
which was *ever* available to that process.  Now that is interesting.  But it
requires that the kernel stack be zeroed out when it is created, and there's
no code in there to do that.
It is probably a useful thing to retain though.  A new CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK
would suit.
