You write and then read, like the transaction based IO methods in 
selinuxfs (TA_write, TA_read).

Not sure how to do this.

It might be possible to do clever things with symlinks so that you can 
access the keys simply in a variety of common ways (e.g. per-session 
directory, all keys directory etc.)

I guess you'd use normal filsystem access controls instead of storing them
with the keys themselves.  i.e. keyrings are directories, and keys are
files (or directories with files including metadata and key data).  Then
xattrs could be used to integrate with things like SELinux.  A user could
then use chmod to specify whether a kerying can be searched, for example.
The main point is that a filesystem API provides several useful framework
components by default:access control, creat/open/read/write etc. syscalls,
hierarchical structure and xattrs.  Using a filesystem API means not
inventing yet another class of API.
