I don't understand; that doesn't sound healthy.

Nothing is free. ;)
We've been talking about creating and merging a sane power management
model for 3+ years now. It's always been known that the drivers will have
to be modified to support a sane model. It's a fact of life. At some
point, we have to bite the bullet and do the work. I see that time rapidly
approaching.
I do not intend to merge a patch that will break swsusp in a stable
kernel. However, we do have this wonderful thing called the -mm tree in
which we can a) evolve the model, b) get large testing coverage and c)
solicit driver fixes.
Once the swsusp consolidation is merged upstream, I will merge a new
device power model in -mm, and we can start working on the drivers. How
does that sound?
