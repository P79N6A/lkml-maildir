I should have mentioned I'm unable to reproduce the original
oops myself, so i wanted confirmation about whether this fixed
the problem.
I had thought the mount problem was that the nfs server causes
the task_struct to be freed before exit_task_namespaces() completes,
so that exit_task_namespaces() dereferences a bad pointer.  If
that were the case, this would fix it by not putting the final
reference to the task_struct (with delayed_put_task_struct())
until after exit_task_namespaces().  It sounds like I misunderstood
the nfs server problem though.

If it is confirmed that my patch is wrong, then I guess we simply
need a two-stage namespace exit, where the first stage happens
above exit_notify() and exits the mounts namespace, and the second
stage can happen in the location I used in this patch.
