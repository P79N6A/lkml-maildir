Ah, thanks,
I always wondered what malloc() would return if at program start we issued an
mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) and then started to malloc() large chunks
of mem until we ran out of memory.
In theory malloc() should fail if the OS cannot guarantee that the the memory
resides in physical ram.  (even if enough VM is available)
Is this actually true ?
(A simple test app could answer this, but I haven't tried yet)
