Has anybody used this successfully in a recent kernel?  With 2.4.5 it seems to 
detect the device successfully:
empeg.c: v1.0.0 Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>, Gary Brubaker <xavyer@ix.netcom.com>
empeg.c: USB Empeg Mark I/II Driver
usbserial.c: Empeg converter detected
usbserial.c: Empeg converter now attached to ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0 for devfs)
but the machine locks up when I try to talk to it.  This is on i386 using the 
usb-uhci driver.
