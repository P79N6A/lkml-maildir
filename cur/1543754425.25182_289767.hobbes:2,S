No,perhaps it isn't clear. If A changes the way a lock is used (for 
example), then all the places which were using the lock the old way have 
to use it the new way, or lockups or similar bad behaviour occur.
Did I say it more clearly? Some things, like locks, have to have all the 
players using the same rules.

Again, I said later that it depends on the maintainer not to apply one 
part which won't work without the others. Not that it wasn't happening, 
but that there's nothing more formal than human talent. I don't regard 
that as a really good way, since it makes more work for maintainers.
I really think the original post was reasonably clear that I was 
suggesting a more formal means of designating things which should be 
accepted as a unit, not whatever you rea into it.
