Terribly sorry for delay. I got a bit distracted by some elements of
testing (dvd playing).

Started make -j2 (my machine is UP), xine-distractor and gvim.
Moving gvim window over xine (even if paused) is jerky, but tolerable.
No skips during playing. No at all. Redraws in MozillaFirebird are
delayed (I get trails all over the firebird window), but again - no
annoyingly long delays.
I continue testing.

I used the G2 on 2.6-test1.
