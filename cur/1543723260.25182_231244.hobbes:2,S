Here is the test case, run it with "strace -f ./clone".  When the bug
happens then strace is stuck waiting for it's traced child that just died,
but you may have to try a few times before it happens.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sched.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
extern int __clone (int (*__fn) (void *__arg), void *__child_stack,
		    int __flags, void *__arg, ...);
extern int __clone2 (int (*__fn) (void *__arg), void *__child_stack_base,
		     size_t __child_stack_size, int __flags, void *__arg, ...);
static int thread (void *arg)
{
  write (2, "thread\n", sizeof ("thread\n"));
  *(volatile int *) 0;
  return 0;
}
#define STACK_SIZE 1024 * 1024
#define CLONE_FLAGS CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_THREAD|CLONE_SYSVSEM

main (void)
{
  void *stack = mmap (0, STACK_SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
		      MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
  pid_t pid;
#ifdef __ia64__
  pid = __clone2 (thread, stack, STACK_SIZE - 64, CLONE_FLAGS, 0);
#else
  pid = __clone (thread, stack + STACK_SIZE - 64, CLONE_FLAGS, 0);
#endif
  printf ("pid = %d\n", pid);
  sleep (1);
  return 0;
}
