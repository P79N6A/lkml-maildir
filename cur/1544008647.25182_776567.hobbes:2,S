I have one other system that can build this kernel, and one that gets
further.  The differences are gcc version (all distro-supplied),
.config, and in one case X86_32 vs. X86_64.

That's the non-working version.  I just verified:
root@vm1:~/linux-2.6# make clean && make arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.o
[...]
  CC      arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.o
arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.c:27: error: array index in initializer exceeds array bounds
arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.c:27: error: (near initialization for ‘sys_call_table’)
arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.c:27: warning: excess elements in array initializer
arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.c:27: warning: (near initialization for ‘sys_call_table’)
make[1]: *** [arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.o] Error 2
root@vm1:~/linux-2.6# make arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.i
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  SYMLINK include/asm -> include/asm-x86
  CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CPP     arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.i
The resulting .i file is identical (checked md5sum) to the one on the
http site:

Cheers,
