Subject: [PATCH] CONFIG_MOUSE should not be tristate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
CONFIG_MOUSE only enables further questions. It is never used except
drivers/char/Config.in where it's checked for being "n".
CONFIG_MOUSE=m makes no sence.
The patch is against 2.4.0-test13-pre4.
