Possibly not.  I thought that simply oopsing the kernel was a bit rude, and
fixing ia32 to not do that was relatively simple.
We should, within reason, handle it as gracefully as possible, yes?

If the not-present memory is marked cacheable and/or writeback then yes,
but that would be an odd thing to do, wouldn't it?
It the memory is mapped noncacheable then a synchronous error on a read
sounds reasonable.  A synchronous error on a write would assume that the
noncacheability affects the write buffers and IIRC that usually doesn't
happen(?).
