thanks! Given the really low preemption latency/granularity default 
(roughly equivalent to 'timeslice length'), and that basically all of my 
focus was on interactivity characteristics, this is a pretty good 
result. I suspect it will be necessary to increase the default to 10 
msecs (or more) to be on the safe side. (Nick has reported a 4% 
kernbench drop so for his kernbench workload it's needed.)
