Tar-able, perhaps, but untar-able? onto the same type of filesystem?
What if tar attempts to extract .streams/myfile/Icon before myfile?
Not to mention that if you tar up a directory and send it to a
friend who un-tars it onto ext2, he's going to get a mess (and
probably shout at you to stop sending such garbage!).
It's really not feasible to make streams visible to traditional
utilities.
