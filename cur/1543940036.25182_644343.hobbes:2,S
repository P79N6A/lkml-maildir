What annoys me about hap and hvm is that it comes from a 
paravirtualization viewpoint, where pv is the default model, and 
hardware extensions are an optional addition.  With kvm it's the other 
way round: the base model is full virtualization, and paravirtualization 
is an optional add-on.  I'd rather call traditional shadow paging 
"software-assisted paging".
