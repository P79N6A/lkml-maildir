I'm not sure that equal bandwidth and deadline are compatible, some
processes may need more bandwidth to meet deadlines. I'm not unhappy about
that, it's the reads waiting in a flood of write or vice-versa that
occasionally make an app really rot.

Hum, looks as if I should plan to retest with 29 and the deadline patches.
My personal test is a program doing one read/sec while making CD images
(mkisofs) on a machine with large memory. It tends to build the whole
700MB in memory and then bdflush decides it should be written and the read
latency totally goes to hell. I will say most of this can be tuned out at
some small cost to total performance (thanks Andrea).
