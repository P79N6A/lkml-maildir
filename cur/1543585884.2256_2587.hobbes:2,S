This ooops happened while trying to nfsboot a 386, and restarting nfsd
halfway through the boot process. I bet it's not a common problem...
Server is 2.4.2-ac23, client (the Oopser) is 2.4.2-ac24.
The oops is partial because I had to hand-copy from the console, and
it blanked after a few minutes. The client was trying to mount its
root fs at the time (it failed).
