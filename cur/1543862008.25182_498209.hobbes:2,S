Just a 'me too' at this point. 
The X server on my shiny new notebook (Core 2 Duo) occasionally dies
with 'select' repeatedly returning ERESTARTNOHAND.  It is most
annoying!
You don't mention in the Email which kernel version you use but I see
from the web page you reference it is 2.6.19.1.  I'm using
2.6.18.something.
I thought I'd have a quick look at the code, comparing i386 to x86-64
and guess what I found.....
On x86-64, regs->rax is "unsigned long", so the following is
needed....
I haven't tried it yet.
