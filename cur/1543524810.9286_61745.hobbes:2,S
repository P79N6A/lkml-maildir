Higher-order pages are "special".
They are used for special-purpose things and they are not
freeable by kswapd or anything else except the code that
requested the pages in the first place.
There is no real need to mark the other pages as used
since they've been removed from the free list and nobody
will see those pages (except the code that has allocated
them).

Rik
