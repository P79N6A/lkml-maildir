   My Asus P55TP4 (i430FX)/AMD K5 PC also crashes after "Booting the
   kernel..."
   and before printing anything else
Are you sure it was compiled with the correct CPU?  If you configure the
CPU incorrectly (686 when you only have a 586, etc.) the kernel *will*
refuse to boot.
Maybe we should have the kernel print the CPU information it was
compiled with before it does anything else.....  It'll make it easier to
catch what may be a fairly common set of PEBCAK case....
