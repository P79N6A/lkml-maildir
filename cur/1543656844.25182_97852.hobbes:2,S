Which is perfectly acceptable IMHO.  There is no reason that a cset need 
document all the details when the file logs already do.  A cset need only 
indicate what basic work is being done and maybe a list of files in the 
cset.  Doing a bk changes -v gets the file comments as well for those 
people that want them.
I actually like the individual file comments part of the cset setup.  It's 
what my preferred use is when I'm making my own patches.  Make the cset 
have a summary of the major changes, then let each file have it's own 
detail change information.
