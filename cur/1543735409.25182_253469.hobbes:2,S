I was thinking that it could drop root privileges and try creating a
realtime thread.  But, then I realied it would be better (and simpler)
for `jackstart' to exec `jackd' unconditionally, even when the
required capabilities are not available.  Let `jackd' figure out for
itself what it can actually do.
That is what I meant about trying the operation being the only
reliable test.  Jackstart should not give up just because one
privilege mechanism is unavailable.  It cannot know all the possible
reasons why jackd might or might not have access to realtime
resources.  Its job is simply to pass the capabilities if they are
available.
