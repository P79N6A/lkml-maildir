I bet the process is waiting for a SIGCHLD from a previously forked
process. Con, would it be possible that under some circumstances,
a process does not receive a SIGCHLD anymore, eg if the child runs
shorter than a full timeslice or something like that ? In autoconf
scripts, there are lots of very short operations that might trigger
such unique cases.
Cheers,
Willy
