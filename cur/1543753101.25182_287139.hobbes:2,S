   ld -m elf_i386  -r -o drivers/ide/legacy/built-in.o drivers/ide/legacy/hd.o
   ld -m elf_i386  -r -o drivers/ide/built-in.o drivers/ide/legacy/built-in.o
drivers/ide/legacy/built-in.o and drivers/ide/built-in.o consist of
exactly one object in your build.  From scripts/reference*.pl:
# Ignore conglomerate objects, they have been built from multiple objects and we
# only care about the individual objects.  If an object has more than one GCC:
# string in the comment section then it is conglomerate.  This does not filter
# out conglomerates that consist of exactly one object, can't be helped.
built-in.o added to the conglomerate list to help a bit.
