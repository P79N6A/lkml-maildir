Indeed, this sounds like a very different problem.

Ok, so let's take a closer look at this. I am mostly interested in the 
behavior of the xircom_tulip_cb from 2.4.13+ and 2.4.12-ac4+ kernels.
When you say the network link is gone, does it mean the network link light 
on the card is gone? What does mii-tool report?
Do you get any kernel messages when the networking dies? Any netdev 
transmit timeouts or anything else?
What are the messages you get from xircom_tulip_cb when it gets 
initialized? [make sure you look at dmesg's output, some syslog 
configurations don't log all kernel messages.]
Can you run tcpdump on the other side of the scp connection to see what 
exactly is going on?

It's very unlikely... but possible. :-)

It does.
Thanks,
