After investigation, there are two issues.
Patch 8/10 oopses during the run, typically after about an hour.
Patch 10/10 oopses during boot.  I haven't been able to reproduce this
on my quad-core machine, but it happens every time for them on their
dual quad-core machine.

Applying just patches 1-7 and 9 leads to a slight (0.34%) performance
reduction compared to slub.  That is 6.45% versus slab, reduces to 6.79%
with the 8 patches applied.
