That reminds me: why does Linux mask the IRQ anyway?
Why doesn't it simply call the handler functions, and then send EOI to
the PIC with no unmasking?
For those rare occasions when an interrupt handler wants to re-enable
interrupts (sti), _then_ it could mask the interrupt that called the handler.
Why wouldn't that work?
