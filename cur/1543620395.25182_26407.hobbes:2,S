I'd love to hear how things could be done right here. 
There seem to be 3 choices for reader writer locks
	1. Do the right thing and say no to inheritance: and this
	means no inheritance on mutexes either.
	2. Use the Solaris - "sometimes kinda works" method.
	3. Make readers/writer locks very slow and expensive e.g
	a complete list of reader identities that with atomic insert/delete
	and with check for uniqueness on insert! Not to mention the write
	promotion, any interactions between the "favor writes" design it should
	have and inheritance, links for a mutex inheriting lock to follow down
	the complete tree of paths from the r/w lock ...
