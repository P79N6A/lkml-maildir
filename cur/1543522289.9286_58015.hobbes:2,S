If you dont like it go found a linux-full-of-spam mailing list set. You can
sit and enjoy your own little spam filled world the rest of us wont read.
What would be far more constructive would be if specific hosts that are secure
got together and figured a policy for publishing an "ok" list based on a
trust scheme that could be queried too.
I'm just disappointed that if you speak for VA then VA's response to people
trying to stop spam is two fingers and an attempt to blame them for other
peoples problems.
