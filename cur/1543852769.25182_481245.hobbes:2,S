IMHO, why break things if it's not necessary?  As I understand it, you can
still take the course of least resistance and implement 64-bit xen/kdump
vmcores with 4-byte alignment -- and everybody's happy, right?
Unlike other tools that could potentially be broken, the crash utility will have
to maintain backwards compatibility for all the other 4-byte aligned 64-bit
vmcores out there.  So to me, it's more a PITA than anything else, and
I'll just adapt it to whatever's out there...
Thanks,
  Dave
