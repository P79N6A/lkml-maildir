If the syscall entry code in the vdso takes care of the multiplexing we
do not have to add any symbols to the vdso's symbol table.  There are no
additional costs associated with adding more optimized syscalls other
than the multiplexer and that cost would be constant if a jump table is
used.
For now, the simple single cmpl is sufficient.
