Hi,
Another patch made it in that assumes FIXADDR_USER_* is constant:
> [PATCH] Put fixmaps into /proc/pid/maps via a pseudo-vma
> 
> From: David Mosberger <davidm@napali.hpl.hp.com>
> 
> This patch makes /proc/PID/maps report the range from FIXADDR_USER_START to
> FIXADDR_USER_END as a final pseudo-vma.  This is consistent with the notion
> that reading /proc/PID/maps tells you about every page containing data that
> the process can in fact access, and with things such as ptrace allowing
> access to this memory.  Without this, userland tools that want to look at all
> of a process's accessible pages need special-case knowledge about things such
> as the vsyscall DSO page.  With this change, existing code that iterates over
> the /proc/PID/maps lines will cover those pages like any other.  For example,
> this lets gdb's "gcore" command synthesize a core file from a live process
> that contains the vsyscall DSO page as a real core dump would, using its
> existing generic iterator code and no new special cases.
On ppc64 I want the 32bit and 64bit FIXADDR area to be at different
places. It would seem ia64 have the same problem supporting x86 properly.
