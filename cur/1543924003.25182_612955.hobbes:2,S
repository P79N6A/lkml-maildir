Yeah, it's probably because filp structures are freed by
RCU, and if you have a locked up CPU then it can't go
through a quiescent state so RCU stops freeing your filps.
If you add some cond_resched()s to your code, you should
find that RCU will force a reschedule and things will work
(actually, for 2.6.16, I'm not sure if RCU had the code to
force a reschedule... it's force_quiescent_state() in
kernel/rcupdate.c upstream).
