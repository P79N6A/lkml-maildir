Sorry, that last statement was a little vague.  I usually start X
with "startx", and that works fine with everything.  Hitting "Log Out"
kills X and gets me back to run level 3.  However, if I do a
/sbin/init 5, log in with the graphical login and then hit "Log Out",
the 2.5.67-[bk,ac1] kernels lock up and -mm1 reboots.
