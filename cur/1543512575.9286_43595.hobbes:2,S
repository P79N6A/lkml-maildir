no spinlock, a rw-semaphore, ie a multiple-reader single-writer sync
object which calls schedule() when the resource is busy.
IIRC, the vma-list is only modified by
* insert_vma_struct(): never sleeps, doesn't allocate memory. No
problems with swap-out.
* merge_vm_area(): dito.
* do_munmap(): the area which modifies the vma-list makes no memory
allocations, should make no problems under low-memory.
--> everyone who needs an exclusive access is OOM safe.
Additionally, the swap-out should use a "starve writer"-policy, ie there
will be no dead-locks with multiple concurrent swap-outs in the same
"struct mm" [concurrent means overlapped io, still serialized by
lock_kernel()].
I think the result should be OOM safe without touching
vm_ops->swapout().
