Thanks for your reply.
My understanding was that although it is a specific device that is
being resumed, actual resume method is for the bus and that should
power up the whole IDE subsystem. Am I wrong?
I see that there is dependency branch information in
dpm_active/dpm_off/dpm_off_irq. Isn't it possible to traverse these
lists and power up parents for a device? What are the issues involved?
Cheers,
Giri
