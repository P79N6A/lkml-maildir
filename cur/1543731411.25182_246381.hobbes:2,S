Thank you for pointing that out. Really. I mean it.
And nothing else it is.
Happy hacking.
IDA anyone? (objdump does nicely, too. I looked at the disassembler 
output for about one hour today and my conclusion is that it's a pretty 
simple job. Knowing the stack concept and the "mov", "call", "lea", 
"add", "sub", "xor", "sar" and "sh[l|r]" instructions is enough.)
I would do it if I just had the time.
