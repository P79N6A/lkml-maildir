    Double ouch.  Swap is backing a non-existent program?

    But if the page in memory is 'dirty', you can't be efficient with swapping
*in* the page.  The page on disk is invalid and should be released, or am I
missing something?

    On my laptop, it is insignificant and to my knowledge has no measurable
impact.  It seems like there is always 3-5 Meg used in swap no matter what's
running (or not) on the system.

    Uhhh, yeah, sorta -- it's addressing the statement that a "new requirement of
2.4 is to have double the swap space".  If everyone agrees that's a problem, then
yes, we can go into specifics of what is causing or contributing to the problem.
It's getting past the attitude of some people that 2xMem for swap is somehow
'normal and acceptable -- deal with it".  In my case, seems like 10Mb of swap would
be all that would generally be used (I don't think I've ever seen swap usage over 7Mb)
on a 512M system.  To be told "oh, your wrong, you *should* have 1Gig or you are
operating in an 'unsupported' or non-standard configuration".  I find that very
user-unfriendly.

    I haven't ever *noticed* this on my machine but that could be
because there isn't much in swap to begin with?  Could be I was
just blissfully ignorant of the time it took to do a swapoff.
Hmmm....let's see...  Just tried it.  I didn't get a total lock up,
but cursor movement was definitely jerky:
> time sudo swapoff -a
real    0m10.577s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m9.430s
Looking at vmstat, the needed space was taken mostly out of the
page cache (86M->81.8M) and about 700K each out of free and buff.

    Probably -- I guess the page cache and disk buffers put enough pressure to
push some things off to swap.
