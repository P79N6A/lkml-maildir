I don't think patch 3 is a good idea.  It's a fair bit of code to
implement a pretty bizarre semantic that I really don't think is all
that useful.  Patches 1-2 are already sufficient to cover the
fork()/exec() case and a fair proportion of fork()/minor
frobbing/exit() cases.  If the child also needs to write the hugepage
area, chances are it's doing real work and we care about its
reliability too.
