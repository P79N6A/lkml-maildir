Hi,
I get an oops right before init spawns complaining about a NULL pointer
dereference.  I'd have run ksymoops on it, but I don't know how to get a copy
of it without copying it all down by hand, and the machine locks hard (even
Alt+SysRq doesn't work).  Things worked OK in 2.2.6.  I know this isn't much
information, so if you need more just ask.  I'm on a P233MMX with 64m RAM.
Thanks,
Brian
