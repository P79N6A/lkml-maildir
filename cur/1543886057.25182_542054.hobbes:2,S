Hello,
we have a D-Link DFE-580TX 4 port network card in our main router.
It works pretty well most of the time, even though an error
message pops up in dmesg every now and then (sometimes once a day
sometimes once every few hours).
But every few weeks those error messages increase rapidly, spamming
dmesg. When this happens the system does not react anymore and pushing
the reset button is the only option left.
I googled around and found out that other users have same problem,
but no solution to this.

No such error message appears for about 7-10 days after a reboot. Maybe
there is some kind of buffer running full?
Do you need any additional info?
Please CC me :-)

Mario.
