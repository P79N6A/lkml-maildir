If netconsole is a module, you should be able to remove it and reload
with different parameters.

Rather than extending the existing kludge with module parameter, to
sysfs. I would rather see a better API for this. Please build think
about doing a better API with a basic set of ioctl's. Some additional
things:
	- shouldn't just be IPV4 specific, should handle IPV6 as well
	- shouldn't specify MAC address, it can do network discovery/arp to
	  find that when adding addresses
