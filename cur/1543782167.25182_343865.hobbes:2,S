Impressive!

Warning! I'm hacking hard to get rid of the global pi_lock, and I'm not
worrying now about efficiency.  I figure that if I can get it to work,
then we can speed it up afterwards.  Since it's complex enough keeping
all the locks straight, I just want it to work without deadlocking. 
Once I get it to work, I'll let you figure out how get it back down to
7-instructions :-)
