Hi
Is there any way of turning off VMS caching for a block device?
I want all reads to come down to the driver, where I decide what to do
about them.  I don't want reads to read locally cached buffers in VMS
unless I say so.  The reason is that the device might have a remote
writer.
I'll have a look at the raw character device later (but I recall
having looked before without it telling me anything - probably
they make a fake request and transfer it to the device queue
directly and treat the return with their own substituted end_req).
I need a block device - I can't mount a character device. Now
there's an idea! A mouse represented as a file system ..
