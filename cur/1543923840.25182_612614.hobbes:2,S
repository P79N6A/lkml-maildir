Yeah, sorry, perhaps I was overly strong.
It doesn't work for me, because:
  - it does connection management in user-space, which makes it
    impossible to reconnect. I'd want a full kernel based client.
  - it had some plugging issues, and after talking to Jens about it
    he suggested a rewrite using ->make_request() ala AoE. [ sorry if
    I'm short on details here, it was a long time ago, and I
    forgot, maybe Jens remembers ]

Ah, right, I keep forgetting about that one. The only draw-back to that
on is, is that its raw ethernet, and not some IP protocol.
