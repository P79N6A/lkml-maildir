I too had such interrupt distribution...
In my case, absolutely no interrupts was taken by CPU1, even the timer...
and I recall that timer interrupts should hit all the CPUS or strange things
can appear.
But, curiously, a
echo 3 >/proc/irq/0/smp_affinity
solved the problem for me (for IRQ 0 only of course)
I say curiously because the old smp_affinity value was 0xffffffff, so
masking the unused bits should have no effect.
