How do we specify which calls belong to a transaction? By some kind of
extra file handle?
I'd think having global per-process transaction is not the best way.
So I think we should have some kind of transaction handle (probably in
the file handle space) and a way to say that a syscall is done within
a transaction. To avoid duplicating all syscalls, we could have
set_active_transaction() operation.
Now I think the criteria for semantics should be serializability. That
would mean, that lookup paths would have to be locked IFF the lookup was
done within the transaction -- but you would be free to open a file
without transaction, then set_active_transaction and write that file.
That way the write would become atomic, but someone else could freely
rename the file from under you.
Note: Editors currently write to a temporary file and rename over the
original (if they have permissions to do it), which is as good
transaction as they need.

If every syscall (touching filesystem) was turned into a transaction of
it's own, it wouldn't break any semantics.
