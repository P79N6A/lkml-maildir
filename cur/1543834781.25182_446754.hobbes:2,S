there's quite a bit of whitespace damage in your patchqueue. For example 
all the 'context' lines have an extra space at their beginning, which 
causes 'patch' to fail on every single chunk. There's also the 
occasional '8 spaces instead of a tab' buglet, probably introduced while 
writing this code.
