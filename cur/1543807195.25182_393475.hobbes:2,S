I hope the driver at least checks that the port is untranslated
(SERIO_I8042, not SERIO_I8042_XL), and that the device behaves as a
mouse.
Btw, I assume the packet format is also indistinguishable from a
standard PS/2 mouse?
If it were integrated into psmouse, it probably need to be enabled by a
module parameter.
