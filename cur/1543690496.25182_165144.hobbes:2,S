Well, the machine is a bi-athlon, and I use prefetchnta... thats all.

Thanks very much. I'm resending my original mail (with a small test program
attached), at the end of this one.

I'm using e1000 driver , on linux-2.6, this driver doesnt use the
rx_copybreak trick.

Here is the copy of the mail I sent the Sep 1st on linux-kernel & linux-net
:
Hi all
I have an annoying problem with a network server (TCP sockets)
On some stress situation,  LowMemory goes close to 0, and the whole machine
freezes.
When the sockets receive a lot of data, and the server is busy, the TCP
stack just can use too many buffers (in LowMem).
TCP stack uses "size-4096" buffers to store the datas, even if only one byte
is coming from the network.
I tried to change /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem, without results.
# echo "1000 10000 15000" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem
You can reproduce the problem with the test program attached.
# gcc -o crash crash.c
# ulimit -n 20000
# ./crash listen  8888 &
# ./crash call 127.0.0.1:8888 &
grep "size-4096 " /proc/slabinfo
size-4096      40015  40015  4096  1  1 : tunables  24  12  0  : slabdata
40015  40015 0
(thats is 160 Mo, far more than the limit given in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem)
grep TCP /proc/net/sockstat
TCP: inuse 39996 orphan 0 tw 0 alloc 39997  mem 79986
What is the unit of 'mem' field ? Unless it is 2Ko, the numbers are wrong.
 How may I ask the kernel NOT to use more than 'X Mo' to store TCP messages
?
Thanks
Eric Dumazet
