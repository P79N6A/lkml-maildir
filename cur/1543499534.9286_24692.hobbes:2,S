That, presumably, includes all reference to the initrd code, and the actual
data in the initrd. But it doesn't include the romfs filesystem code. Or indeed
the module loading code, which could also be marked as init code for embedded
systems which have 'boot modules'.
A boot loader like grub can fairly easily boot a selected kernel 'core' with a
handful of modules, reading them all directly off an ext2 filesystem. And this
can be done from a simple command line on a boot floppy. That's ideal for
system recovery.
I don't fancy trying to write a bootloader which is capable of generating an 
initrd with the required modules.
Having said that, these are hardly overriding reasons for using such a system 
instead of an initrd - Unix has never been very easy to install and recover, 
so why should we make it so at this point?  But couple it with the other 
points I brought up, and it becomes a far more attractive proposition.
