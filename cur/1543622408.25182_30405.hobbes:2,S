  My though would be that when something is working right, the first step
is to check that you are doing things in a known safe way. Therefore I
would (a) use /dev/hde, and (b) set -X34 with hdparm.
  I do those things, I have two internal systems working and two at
client sites, which I assume are working since they aren't teling me
otherwise.
