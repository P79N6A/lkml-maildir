If you can make the virtual devices look like ethernet, I believe a lot of other things
will just work w/out hacking, including user-space apps that think they
know exactly what an ethernet frame/device looks like.
The only things I think of that won't work like ethernet is the ability to
change the local MAC address or go into promisc mode.  And, it's always possible
that future wifi hardware will support that as well.  Either way, the current
API handles this fine:  the requests to change will just fail with a convenient error.
