One more set of numbers to calculate would be an estimate of cross-references
across chunks of block groups -- 1 (=128MB), 2 (=256MB), 4 (=512MB), 8(=1GB)
as suggested by Kalpak.
Once we have that, it would be nice if we can get data on results with
the tool from other people, especially with larger filesystem sizes.
