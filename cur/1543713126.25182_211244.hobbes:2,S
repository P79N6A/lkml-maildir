Files spontaneously getting newer is also problem, although the
consequence is usually less severe than spontaneously getting older.

The patch always increments the stored seconds by one.  If an inode
is read, dirtied, then stored, the seconds fields will all be
incremented by 1 every time that happens, won't they?  I.e. every
change to atime interleaved by a flush will increment the seconds
field of ctime and mtime, won't it?
To round up the time properly, I think you need to change the code
that reads the inode, so that newly read inodes get a tv_nsec value of
999999999, and leave the writing code alone.
