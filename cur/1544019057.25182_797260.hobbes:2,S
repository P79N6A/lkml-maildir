ping?
This is a very serious paravirt_ops slowdown affecting the native kernel's 
performance to the tune of 5-10% in certain workloads.
It's been about 2 years ago that paravirt_ops went upstream, when you told 
us that something like this would never happen, that paravirt_ops is 
designed so flexibly that it will never hinder the native kernel - and if 
it does it will be easy to fix it. Now is the time to fulfill that 
promise.
