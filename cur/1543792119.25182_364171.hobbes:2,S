Measuring the actual performance improvement on kbuild.
Not to mention that profiles for things like mod_page_state
go dramatically down, but you can't use that alone to be sure
of an improvement.

Right I didn't see that. ppc(32), then.
I think maybe for struct page_state there is not so much point
in using local_t because the hot page allocator paths can easily
be covered under the interrupt critical sections.
The other fields aren't very hot, and using local_t would bloat
this up by many cachelines on 64-bit architectures like ppc64,
and would make them probably noticably more expensive on 32s
like ppc.
Actually, the NUMA fields in the pcp lists can probably also
just be put under the interrupt-off section that the page
allocator uses. At least it should be much easier to do when
Seth's __alloc_pages cleanup goes in. I'll keep it in mind.
