Ah, I hadn't realised that 'bool FOO depends on tristate BAR' would
allow FOO=y, BAR=m. And since we don't recurse into drivers/mtd at all
when building vmlinux and CONFIG_MTD=m, setting CONFIG_SSFDC=y would
mean that it _thought_ it was building mtd_blkdevs.c into the kernel but
in fact it wasn't. I hadn't tested that combination, since it makes no
sense -- yet it's what allmodconfig does. Sorry 'bout that.
I've fixed this by making SSFDC a tristate, and I've fixed it
differently for CMDLINEPARTS which has had the same problem for ages.

Not sure which you're referring to -- there's a NULL-terminated array of
strings which seems just fine as it is, and there's a size vs. C-H-S
table. The latter could _possibly_ use C99 initialisers, but for
something so simple I think it would just get in the way. It's an
entirely local structure anyway -- it's defined just above the table.
We don't have to worry about the initialiser getting out of sync with
the structure definition, so I didn't see the point in mandating C99
initialisers for it, since Claudio chose to do otherwise. It's his
choice, as far as I'm concerned.
I did notice that he misspelled 'MiB' and fix that though :)

Done. Thanks for spotting that.
