Fact: you're wrong. I _constantly_ get emails when something breaks. It 
doesn't happen all that often, but it happens.
IOW, I _know_ from personal experience that people depend on it. No ifs, 
buts and maybes about it.

No. People in this thread have almost uniformly ignored my arguments.
If it's MTD-specific, nobody _cares_ where it goes. Somebody take a 
fricking flying leap of faith here.
If that's all that people want, I hereby proclaim that
	include/asm-xxx/user/xxxx.h
	include/user/xxxx.h
is reserved for user-visible stuff. And now you can send me small and 
localized patches that fix a _particular_ gripe. 
But claiming that __KERNEL__ doesn't work is clearly a bunch of crapola. 
As is the notion that you can somehow do it all. We do it in small pieces.
Happy now?
