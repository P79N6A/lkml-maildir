A definitive NACK to this export.  All other filesystems manage to use
the generic file read code so GFS should do so aswell.  And there's a technical
reason for not exporting aswell as the generic file read interface is far
too complicated already.

In fact neither gfs nor dquot should use it at all.  The xfs quota code
is fine without this nonsense.
