My disk is supposed to support ATA66 and ATA100...
I tried User Defined HD in the BIOS.  Changed PIO from 4 to 1...  and I also tried DMA 5,4,2,disabled...  (And I tried 'auto' disk detection)
Always same error...
I also got problems while trying to install RH 7.2...  Unabled to finish installation because it gave me I/O error while formatting /boot partition.
Any more ideas?
Thanks for your help!
