 I'm working on a driver for the "enhanced game port" mode of
some soundcards. (Basically they take over polling the joystick
so the CPU doesn't have to.) I've got it working for a Trident
4Dwave card, now I'm working on the Aureal Vortex 1 & 2.
 I managed to get hold of a Vortex 2 for the weekend. I've been
testing my code, which I developed by reading Rubini's "Linux
Device Drivers", following threads on linux-kernel, and perusing
code, e.g. the acenic driver.
 The problem is ioremap(). I don't have to do it for the 4DWave,
it uses I/O ports and inb, etc., are good enough. The Vortex
uses memory-mapped I/O, however, and I can't get that working.
 Here's the relevant portion of the code:
----------------------
                /* Get base address to read card values */
                pci_read_config_dword(pci_p, 0x10, &info->reg_base);
                printk(KERN_WARNING "joy-pci: reg_base 1: %x\n",
                       info->reg_base);
                info->reg_base = pci_p->base_address[0];
                printk(KERN_WARNING "joy-pci: using reg_base of %x\n",
                       info->reg_base);
                info->mem_base = ioremap(info->reg_base,
                                         JS_PCI_VORTEX_MEM_SIZE);
                printk(KERN_WARNING "joy-pci: ioremapped, mem_base is %p\n",
                       info->mem_base);
                /* Disable legacy game port. */
                regval = readl(info->mem_base + JS_PCI_VORTEX2_LEGACY_CR);
                writel(regval & ~0x8,
                       info->mem_base + JS_PCI_VORTEX2_LEGACY_CR);
                printk(KERN_WARNING "joy-pci: disabled analog port\n");
----------------------
 Here's the sad output I get:
----------------------
joy-pci: reg_base 1: de000000
joy-pci: using reg_base of de000000
joy-pci: ioremapped, mem_base is c806b000
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c8113030
current->tss.cr3 = 060ea000, %cr3 = 060ea000
*pde = 07fce063
*pte = 00000000
----------------------
 So, what the heck am I doing wrong? (This is kernel 2.2.11, if
it matters.) Any suggestions, correction, more information I
can provide? From everything I've read, this ought to work. Why
doesn't it?
 (I'd appreciate it if you could CC me. I *am* on the list, but
it's dang hard to read using the Exchange web interface, which
I'll have to do from home.)
 Thanks for any help y'all can provide!
 Sincerely,
