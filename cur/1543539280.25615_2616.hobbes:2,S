Hello,

 It has a

The setup that I have is a block device on 'byblos' that
is mounted on 'pc9'. When I try to connect another client
pc, say pc5, to it, I follow the same steps I did on PC9:
insert the nbd module, create the /dev/nd0 device, and when
when I try to create the device as mke2fs /dev/nd0:
[root@pc5 /root]# mke2fs /dev/nd0
mke2fs 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Filesystem label=
OS type: Linux
Block size=4096 (log=2)
Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
262144 inodes, 524287 blocks
26214 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=0
16 block groups
32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
16384 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912
Writing inode tables: done                            
ext2fs_mkdir: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short
read while creating root dir
[root@pc5 /root]#
What is this error? 
Thank you.
