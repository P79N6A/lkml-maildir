That, or just comment it appropriately instead. Or, perhaps better, make
a real interface that works for both types of devices. It's even
confusing that the final queue cleanup and md can use the same
blk_sync_queue function, it's more by 'chance' than by design because
the driver queue is already in a known and shut down state. So I don't
like it at all.
The blk_freeze_queue() stuff I suggested should work, I'll try and make
a patch.
