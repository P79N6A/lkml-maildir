Soft real-time is also something all of you use every day.
Most telephone switches are soft real time.
They mostly react within 10 ms.
As an example see
  www.erlang.org
It is a functional interpreted language designed to program that
kind of systems. (It is also used in Ericssons ATM switches)
BTW - it is really slow if you try to do standard benchmarks,
but suddenly when you have a real system. Then it is ok - and you
can easily add more processors...
