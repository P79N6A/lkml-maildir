I applied the latest mmuops patch to a 2.6.24 kernel & updated the
GRU driver to use it. As far as I can tell, everything works ok.
Although more testing is needed, all current tests of driver functionality
are working on both a system simulator and a hardware simulator.
The driver itself is still a few weeks from being ready to post but I can
send code fragments of the portions related to mmuops or external TLB
management if anyone is interested.
