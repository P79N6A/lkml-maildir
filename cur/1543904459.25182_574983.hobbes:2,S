Subject: pte_offset_map for ppc assumes HIGHPTE

hello,
The implementation of pte_offset_map() for ppc assumes that PTEs are
kept in highmem (CONFIG_HIGHPTE). There is only one implmentation of
pte_offset_map() as follows (include/asm-ppc/pgtable.h):
#define pte_offset_map(dir, addr)               \
         ((pte_t *) kmap_atomic(pmd_page(*(dir)), KM_PTE0) + pte_index(addr))
Shouldn't this be made conditional according to CONFIG_HIGHPTE is
defined or not (as implemented in include/asm-i386/pgtable.h) ?
the same goes for pte_offset_map_nested and the corresponding unmap functions.
thanks,
Satya Popuri
