i agree that the IDR subsystem should be irq-safe if GFP_ATOMIC is 
passed in. So the _irqsave()/_irqrestore() fix should be done.
But i also think that you should avoid using GFP_ATOMIC for any sort of 
reliable IO path and push as much work into process context as possible. 
Is it acceptable for your infiniband IO model to fail with -ENOMEM if 
GFP_ATOMIC happens to fail, and is the IO retried transparently?
