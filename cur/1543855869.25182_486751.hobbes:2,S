We can make explicitl preemption checks in the main loop of
tcp_recvmsg(), and release the socket and run the backlog if
need_resched() is TRUE.
This is the simplest and most elegant solution to this problem.
The one suggested in your patch and paper are way overkill, there is
no reason to solve a TCP specific problem inside of the generic
scheduler.
