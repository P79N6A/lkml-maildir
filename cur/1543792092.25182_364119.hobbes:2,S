The greatest braggarts are usually the biggest cowards.
In many walks of life, a conscience is a more expensive encumbrance than a wife or a carriage.Enthusiasm is the genius of sincerity and truth accomplishes no victories without it.Be careful the environment you choose for it will shape you be careful the friends you choose for you will become like them.
I attempt an arduous task but there is no worth in that which is not a difficult achievement.Even when the experts all agree, they may well be mistaken.
One half who graduate from college never read another book.Impossible situations can become possible miracles.In economics, hope and faith coexist with great scientific pretension and also a deep desire for respectability.
I wish I could be half as sure of anything as some people are of everything.Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.Adversity has the same effect on a man that severe training has on the pugilist -- it reduces him to his fighting weight.
