Alan, you misunderestimate[1] how important Linux has become.  Linux is
important and pervasive enough that you have the ability to make any new
word you wish, like well, "Linux".
(Although I do hope and pray that "propogate" never becomes an accepted
spelling).

And Microsoft says deploying Linux is "risky".  Are we supposed to care?
I've changed my mind on this issue.  I think we should keep "journaled" in
the sources.  It makes sense and if future dictionaries credit the etymology of
that word to Linux kernel developers, so much the better.
