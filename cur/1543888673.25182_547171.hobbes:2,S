Hum.. I guess, a 0/4 scenario wouldn't fit well in this explanation..
all 4 spinners "tend" to be on CPU0 (and as I understand each gets
~25% approx.?), so there must be plenty of moments for
*idle_balance()* to be called on CPU1 - as gkrellm, top and X consume
together just a few % of CPU. Hence, we should not be that dependent
on the load balancing interval here..
(unlikely consiparacy theory) - idle_balance() and load_balance() (the
later is dependent on the load balancing interval which can be in
sync. with top/gkerllm activities as you suggest) move always either
top or gkerllm between themselves.. esp. if X is reniced (so it gets
additional "weight") and happens to be active (on CPU1) when
load_balance() (kicked from scheduler_tick()) runs..
p.s. it's mainly theoretical specualtions.. I recently started looking
at the load-balancing code (unfortunatelly, don't have an SMP machine
which I can upgrade to the recent kernel) and so far for me it's
mainly about getting sure I see things sanely.
