Put the patch back, since I added some new cc'

No, I assumed that Russell/David were smarter than we were, and that doing so 
would not be a problem :)
Not looking at ./arch or ./include TASK_SIZE looks like it is only used in 
fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c
fs/binfmt_elf.c
fs/namespace.c
fs/binfmt_aout.c
fs/namei.c
kernel/kexec.c
mm/mremap.c
mm/mempolicy.c
mm/memory.c 
mm/nommu.c 
mm/mmap.c
I poked through some, and from first glance, it mostly looked OK with setting 
TASK_SIZE to CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE or memory_end.
