I've experienced such weird corruption of data at least six times in
my life.
I maintain several Linux boxes (mainly 2.2.x) and a lot of Windows
boxes.  Such corruptions of data occured on many of my Linux boxes, on
both SCSI and EIDE disks, but not on any Windows boxes (they hang
quite often, though ;-).
I wrote my report here:
