Hi Chris,
here are some steps to narrow it down.
1. try the latest kernel first (2.6.16.16). This BUG should be fixed there.
2. try without grsecurity patch 
3. if it still persists:
	Please provide more information about your setup before
	submitting a bug.
	lspci -vvv and your .config would be the minimum
	some ethtool outputs (ethtool -k ethX) would help here.
4. If you like to have it resolved very fast, please try git-bisect.
    This can take a lot of time (several recompiles and reboots needed!).
Happy Bug hunting!
Regards
Ingo Oeser
