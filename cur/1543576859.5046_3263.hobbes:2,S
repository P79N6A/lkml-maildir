One could possibly cheat and use fork() instead of using threads. 
Do your listen() before forking..then both get the listener socket..
Threads aren't always the answer, in this case it wouldn't probably gain
you anything over just doing a fork() on SMP. Especially if you got not 
good reason to be sharing data that closely, which I don't think thttpd
would.
