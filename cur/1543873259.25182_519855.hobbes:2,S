Hi,
I am newbie developing a routing application which
needs three features;
1. if the fib lookup fails, my application needs to know about using
preferably
netlink, -- any direction to some sample code or files in the kernel???
2. I need a counter recording the hits a fib entry is chosen for
packet forwarding. Is it the function fn_trie_lookup in file
/net/ipv4/fib_trie.c i need to modify and look into?
-- ?? and therefore is it safe to add a int counter in fib_node w/o
breaking the build??
2. need to read the entire fib, i.e dump the fib to the user space,
-- again any direction to some sample code etc..
i have seen a fn in /source/net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c , which looks like
is supposed to dump the routes but not sure how to use it..
line no.581 int inet_dump_fib(struct sk_buff *skb, struct
netlink_callback *cb)
Also;
fn_trie_dump() in /net/ipv4/fib_trie.c
This could be an inappropriate list for the above questions,  if it is
request for
some direction on the appropriate mailing list
Appreciate any help.
Thanking you,
Sujay
