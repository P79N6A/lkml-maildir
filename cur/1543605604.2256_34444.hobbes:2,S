The 128Mb of "buffers" is within e2defrag itself.  The kernel, seeing 
a HUGE amount of disk activity, allocates as much RAM as possible to 
aid the cause - this also means it evicts unused applications to 
swap.  This is *perfectly normal*.  Your machine is not pageing 
heavily, so overall it's a win.  Once you start using those apps 
again, they'll come straight back into memory where and when you want 
them.
Come to that, this is the first time I've heard of e2defrag.  I'm 
gonna take a look.  :)
