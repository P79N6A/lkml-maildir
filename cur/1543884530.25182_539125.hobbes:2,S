I looked into this a while back, and the kernel does have a CCITT based crc16 
function.  The problem is that it works on the opposite bit order from what I 
need, so to use it I'll have to bitswap every byte as it goes in and then 
bitswap the resulting crc16.  That's more code and probably less efficient 
than just implementing the crc itself.  I wouldn't mind moving it to lib/ 
though, but nobody else in the kernel is using this bit order.
