Well not really, as far as I can see we _need_ a pool per queue. Imagine
a bio handed to raid, needs to be split to 6 different queues. But our
minimum is 4, deadlock possibility. It could probably be made to work,
however I greatly prefer a per-queue reserve.

Sure. However, they don't really mean _anything_. Max is just some
random number to prevent one queue going nuts, and could be completely
removed if the vm works perfectly. Beyond some limit there's little
benefit to doing that, though. But MAX could be runtime tunable. Min is
basically just to make sure we don't kill ourselves, I don't see any
point in making that runtime tunable. It's not really a tunable.
