The system sleeps while waiting for the disk (actually, for the SATA
host port) to be done with its work.
As Andi explained, if the system gives the disk a small task, waits for
the task to be completed, then gives it a next task and so on, latencies
add up and eat into effective bandwidth. Give the disk a whole set of
tasks so that
  - it has immediately something new to do when it finished one task,
  - deep pipes are not mostly empty due to "bubbles" in the pipe,
  - tasks can be reordered to be executed in optimized manner for good
    bandwidth utilization (if software/ firmware/ hardware is present
    which supports this; e.g. the Linux kernel itself),
etc.
Also make each task large so that the ratio of protocol overhead to net
data payload stays minimal.
