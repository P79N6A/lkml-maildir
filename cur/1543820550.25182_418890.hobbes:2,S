"shutdown -hP now" just causes the machine to power off... i need it to go 
into S5 -- because it'll only respond to wake-on-lan from S5.  it doesn't 
respond to WOL after a "shutdown -hP now"...
ironically the off-by-1 bug let me get into S5... and i thought i had my 
code working.
so what i'm really curious about now is the Right Way to go into S5...
somehow with fc4 "shutdown -h now" put it in S5, but with debian it 
doesn't... and i haven't figured out yet where the fedora/debian 
kernel/sysvinit patches differ on this behaviour.
