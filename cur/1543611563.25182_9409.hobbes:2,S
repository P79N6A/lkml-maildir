Not completely.  Many people who *need* to develop for solaris on sun
hardware will run solaris x86 at home (or maybe on a corporate laptop) to be
able to work at home and test the software there too.  I know one such
developer myself, there have to be more.

Before 2.3 and 2.4 there probably would've been much more contention against
something like this.  Even now with large SMP scalability goals, I think it
would be hard to get something like this to be accepted into Linux.
