Andi,
I've got the serial cable setu, now I'm compiling 2.6.2-rc1 based on
the config from 2.6.1-mm5, which is what I'm running right now.  So it
looks like my issue is possibly with the new CPU selection stuff in
2.6.2-rc1 and later -mm kernels.  Hopefully I'll get this up and
running soon.
Thanks for your help and the early printk patch.
John
