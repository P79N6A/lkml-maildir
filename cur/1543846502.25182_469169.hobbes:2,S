The GPLv2 isn't open source, so it can't (legally) be forked:
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
(The "mere aggregation" clause is, in fact, very important, since 
otherwise it would be impossible to distribute GPLed code along with the 
license for it.)
Now, it would be plausible to get Creative Commons to do a "provide 
source" clause, such that there would be an alternative text with the same 
effect as the GPLv2, if there was enough negative opinion about the FSF to 
justify having an alternative text to use for this effect.
