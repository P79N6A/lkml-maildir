Hi,
Here is fdisk -l results:

[root@yakuza root]# /sbin/fdisk -l /dev/hde
Disk /dev/hde: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 1867 cylinders

Partition table entries are not in disk order
As you can see, I have a fat16 partition on hdg. I can delete it and make
an ext3 partition there and see if that changes anything.
Thanks,

Could you provide fdisk -l for both? For some odd reason unknown to me
some filesystems give slower results with hdparm than others, even with
the buffer-cache reads (which are intended to measure memory speed, not
drive speed, and thus should be the same for all drives on a given
mainboard). Also, hdparm directly on the drive device is often a bit
slower than hdparm for the first (outermost) partition. These problems
have been far worse in older kernels, though. With 2.2 I once
benchmarked a vfat-partition at half the speed the same partition gave
as ext2.
