Yes, but using consistent memory is not necessarily the fast way - in
fact it probably won't be.  Machines which don't do DMA cache snooping
will need to disable caching to get consistent memory, so using
consistent memory is very slow - on such a machine explicit syncs are
preferable wherever possible.
On a machine which is nicely consistent, the cache "flushes" should
become NOPs, so we'd expect the two sides of that if to do the same
thing.
