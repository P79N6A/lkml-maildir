Keith, I apologize for my rash words.  I clicked send before I cooled
down, and I should know better.  I care a lot about my work.  I am
sorry.

I thought it was pretty obvious that I was shipping a non-GPL module
(not binary-only).  But that is not my only interest.  I have given time
and thought to many open source projects.  I genuinely wanted a more
informative error message.

From the point of view of the user, who sees the message after the
module is loaded, it is incorrect and implies that the module wasn't
loaded.
