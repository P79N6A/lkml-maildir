These do different things...
If you put -j3 on the command line as an option to the primary make, it
can (will) run that many processes and do things out of order. If you use
MAKE='make -j3' it only takes effect after a new make process is started.
So you can put all the things on one command line and they will be run to
completion sequentially. I find this helpful to avoid mixing bzImage and
modules, one may get an error and the other will keep on going, scrolling
the error off the screen.
