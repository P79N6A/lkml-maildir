No, I'd personally reject madwifi not because of the HAL but because it
uses the net80211 stack [1].  We don't need another 802.11 stack in the
Linux kernel, of course.  But since the Devicescape people have already
ported madwifi to d80211 (see David Kimdon's announcement on netdev on
Oct. 17th), that appears to be a valid path to follow and at least some
of the work has already been done.  If the HAL bits were ported to ar5k
and folded back into the driver, I think that would be a great start.
Dan
[1] nothing against net80211; it's a fine stack.  But There Can Be Only
One, if just for sanity's sake.
