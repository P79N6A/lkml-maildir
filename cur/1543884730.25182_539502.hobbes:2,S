This is not very true based on my understanding of EEVDF, please look at 
the email I just sent out to Ingo for explanation.

First of all, CFS does not seems to address this issue to. This is a 
typical real-time or soft real-time question, that is not only the 
bandwidth of a task has to be fixed, i.e. 10% of cpu bandwidth (which 
proportional shared system, like CFS, EEVDF does not do), and the work 
need to satisfy a deadline.
In both CFS, EEVDF, the scheduler have keep tweaking weights to give a 
fixed bandwidth to application. Authors of EEVDF claims this can be 
done, but never implemented :-(
