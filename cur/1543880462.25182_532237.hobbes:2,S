Hi Alan,
	I meant that the module is gone: it has told the object (via
unregister_xxx) that it's gone.

There are certainly other ways of doing it, such as a mutex, a refcnt &
completion (for function pointers), or disabling preemption across the
access and using stop_machine().  Of course, these add complexity.
This is the reason that I've always disliked module removal.  We have a
lot of code to deal with it and it has awkward semantics (unless --wait
is used).  OTOH, I'm not a fan of the network approach, either: I feel
that bringing up an interface should bump the refcnt of the module which
implements that interface.  Currently taking out e1000 will just kill my
eth0.
Cheers,
Rusty.
