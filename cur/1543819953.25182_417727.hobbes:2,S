Not anymore, after the recent campaign to elliminate explicit NULL
checks before calls to kfree().

If that fixup amounts to re-adding the NULL check just elliminated
then that's no improvement. It would be better to drop the assumption
that kfree() calls with a NULL argument are uncommon, and consequently
remove the unlikely() predictor. Adding likely() instead may or may
not be a good idea.
