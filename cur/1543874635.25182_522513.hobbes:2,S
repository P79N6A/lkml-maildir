Well, in take 3 I _already_ removed quite _a lot_ of itsy-bitsy units,
and I thought it is enough, so I've submitted it. But later I've
realized that I should go further (e.g., dispose of per-unit data
structures), and started more re-work. Yes, I should have notified about
this new re-work, apologies.
Point taken, will be fixed :-)
