I think the answer is yes, you want to have a tasklet per device, but not 
like what was following ;)
You should just add the struct tasklet_struct into your per-device private 
data (DCB - driver control block? sounds like Windows to me...), and have
it point back to it. Should work just fine, much cleaner than a number of 
global tasklet declarations.
