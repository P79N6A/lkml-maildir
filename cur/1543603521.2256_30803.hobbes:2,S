Wow what a wild spin off of my stream of consciousness.

Well in this case it is Mach not Hurd, and I wouldn't be suprised if
you could find MAP_COPY in selected BSDs.  The semantics wanted are
very reasonable.  You only want to see your changes to a given file. 
In practice there is no reason that anyone needs to actually change
the file so MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_DENYWRITE is much more sensible (at
least implementation wise).

Definentily.

I quite agree that MAP_COPY is not worth implementing.  And I never
said otherwise.  I only mentioned so I could think what the
alternatives where and what it's benefits really were.

Probably.  I can't think of any other cases where this could trigger.
However I think is is sensible to export MAP_DENYWRITE to user space.
It cheaply closes the administration bug, it is partially exported
already, and can even allow dynamic loaders to follow the kernel
noexec policy.  
The latter looks like an actual advantage over MAP_COPY.  Though
somehow MAP_EXECUTABLE sounds like a better name...
