I think this is deadlockable. We already (release_task) hold
tasklist_lock here. What if this timer has no SIGEV_THREAD_ID ?
posix_timer_fn locks timer->it_lock first, then locks tasklist_lock
in send_group_sigqueue().
Also, sys_timer_delete() locks ->it_lock, then ->sighand.lock.
I think the better fix would be re-check ->sighand in send_sigqueue,
like Paul's patches do.
Oleg.
