In I2C mode, you can even alternate as many read and write sequences you
want in a single transaction. The target chip would of course need to
know how to interpret such a transaction though. I've never seen this
possibility used so far.
In SMBus mode, you are limited by the transaction types that have been
defined, but a number of them are composed of a write transaction and a
read transaction (separated by what is known as a "repeated start").
Read Byte, Read Word, Read Block and Read I2C Block are such
transactions. See the SMBus specification for the details.

Depends on the SMBus. A SMBus controller could implement 16-bit address
I2C block transfers. I don't think I saw one do so far, but it's still
possible in theory.
Also note that this can easily be emulated using a Write Byte command
(which writes 2 bytes on the bus) to set the 16-bit addressed EEPROM
offset, then using continuous Receive Byte commands to get the data.
This is of course slower than a block read though.

The I2C specifications are available from Philips. The SMBus
specifications are available from smbus.org. Intel also has good
datasheets for all ICH chips.
