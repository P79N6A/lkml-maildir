I've had LPr, LP1000r, LP2000r, and LH6000s in *heavy* production for
two years straight with nary a whimper from the eepro100, e100, or e1000
drivers.*  This is SMP with 2-6 procs, 256MB-4GB RAM, all 2.2 and 2.4
kernels under RH6.2.  On 100/1000, never 10Mb though.
Not to say that the HPs smell like roses, but I would highly suspect bad
hardware or a suspect BIOS/PCB revision, etc. in this case.
Just my US$0.02,

* besides a quirky arp issue on boot that seemed to go away on its own
and wasn't card-specific.  And the long-standing I/O APIC issues. ;)
