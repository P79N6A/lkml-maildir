I suppose you mean I need to use remap_page_range with the address
obtained from ioremap, don't you?
But, that apart, is a device driver that give available a part of the
PCI IO space of controlled card via mmap portable to all platforms that
have PCI?
And if this is true, the user application that use this mmaped area may
be written in a platform independant way?
I'd like that you show a little example of what you call "suffering".
