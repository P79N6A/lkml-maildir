Bug in lsusb or in the kernel drivers?
Can you send what /proc/bus/usb/devices looks like with the device
plugged in, _and_ the driver bound to the device?  Doing that reads the
strings from the device, just like lsusb should be doing.  If that is
successful, I think the problem would be in lsusb.
thanks,
