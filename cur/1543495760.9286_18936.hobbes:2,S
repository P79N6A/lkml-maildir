My guess is that MS will rewrite certain subsystems to exploit the tests.
I would be very suspicious of any machine that comes from them pre-configured.
That's not to say that WindoesN'T doesn't perform. In my daily work,
although I'm one of the fortunate ones that get paid primarily to work
on/with Linux, I see NT running surprisingly fast and well in a lot of
situations. It's not perfect, but then, neither is Linux. There is a lot
to say about a product with 100s of *directed* programmers working on it
actually being paid money. I'm astonished and thrilled to death at how
well Linux is doing.
