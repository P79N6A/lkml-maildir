Hello,
I am currently looking into an issue where a host sporadically locks up. I will
retrieve the SYSRQ+P tomorrow when I am back at the machine.
Until then, here's the real question:
Given that some kernel code (possibly a module) runs in an infinite loop, and
thus not giving back control to the user (in an UP environment), is there a
possibility to force a schedule?
Something like the normal scheduler does to processes ("you got your timeslice,
and not more"), but also when they are in kernel mode.
