Hi, 
I agree that "too many keys pressed" message is annoying; I have some
objections to the rest of the changes:

This message has severity "error" since at this point because keyboard
initialization fails and you are left without a keyboard.

Ditto. This is a hard error, not a warning, because keyboard will not be
available if atkbd fails to enable it.

Somebody either pokes directly in the keyboard controller guts or keymap is
incomplete - both deserve a warning, although wording could be better.

Might be useful while debugging reconnect code but otherwise normal situation
and is not worth mentioning.
