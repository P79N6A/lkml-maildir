$ uname -a
Linux mau.local.network 2.4.0-test5 #2 Wed Jul 26 21:44:36 CEST 2000 \
i586 unknown
(with pre6 patch)
But apparently the problem occur *only* on a ReiserFS partition.
That's clean on a ext2 partition (and even a vfat partition).
BTW, recently, NIIBE Yutaka reported problem with exit_mmap
(apparently fixed from pre4).
However, INN news server seem to trigger a similar behavior on ext2
too. (The small program in my previous post was supposed to reproduce
it.)
And, if I remember correctly, under test4, all was fine under ReiserFS
(with the same patch). I will do more testing, and post more
informations if you want.
  Regards,
  Fred
