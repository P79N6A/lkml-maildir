You appear to be unaware of early userspace. Moving code out of the 
kernel does _not_ mean eliminating that code completely.  I was hoping 
it was obvious that it is impossible to eliminate the tasks that 
do_mounts.c performs -- otherwise a Linux system would never have a root 
filesystem mounted.
Being unaware of early userspace implies that you are not familiar with 
initramfs.
Which implies you wish you merge your own code in place of something you 
do not understand.
