Since Kernel 2.2.4, I have problems with the GCD-R580B IDE CD-ROM
(Goldstar). YaST, the setup tool of the SuSE Distribution, breaks while
reading the package descriptions. I'm sorry, but I have no real error
description, because the kernel doesn't report an error. This is the
output from YaST:
*** ERROR: [PkgRetriever 1 (1)

With kernel 2.2.3 and any prior kernel the problem doesn't exist. The
error is reproducible, and switching back to 2.2.3 solves the problem.
