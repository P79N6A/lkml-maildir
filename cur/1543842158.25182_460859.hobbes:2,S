Followup on this: maybe you were referring to the patch in <URL:

which adds filesystem support for capabilities.  I haven't actually
checked in detail, but reading throught it, it appears to be quite
compatible with my own patch (one merely needs to do something about
the new bunch of capabilities I've introduced, but it should be easy
to hack something which makes sure no programs are surprised or
broken).  I'll try to come up with a combined patch soon, which will
add both the inheritability support I suggest *and* filesystem
support.
I emphasize that the filesystem support patch described above, alone,
will *not* solve the inheritability problem (as my patch does), since
unmarked executables continue to inherit no caps at all.  With my
patch, they behave as though they had a full inheritable set,
something which is required if we want to make something useful of
capabilities on non-caps-aware programs.
