If your process has got work to do and has a higher priority than other 
processes, it gets to run. If you don't want this behavior, don't give 
it such a high priority.
If you want low latency to do some quick high priority task, just do it 
quickly and relinquish the processor, instead of hogging it.
What are you trying to accomplish, anyway?
