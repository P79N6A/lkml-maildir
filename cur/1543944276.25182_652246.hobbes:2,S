yes - i zapped hw breakpoint support in -v10 already.

yes, that's what i've been doing. When anything became questionable even 
just a little bit, it was the axe or i changed it to something really 
obvious and correct.
by 2.6.26 kgdb-light will become so neutral to the rest of the kernel 
that we wont even notice that we've merged it ;-)

yeah. I believe we need to achieve a "known zero impact, 100% trustable" 
state for KGDB to start with, and add stuff carefully to it.

yes - if something locks up, it will be the NMI watchdog starting the 
debugger eventually - not the other way around. The NMI watchdog is 
already system policy which can be turned on/off and is well known and 
expresses the user's wishes with what should happen to the system.
The debugger should really be a fundamentally very passive "console" 
type of thing, with as little direct policy as possible. That minimizes 
the chance that it accidentally messes up something and also makes it 
more likely that it will actually work reliably and dependably.
