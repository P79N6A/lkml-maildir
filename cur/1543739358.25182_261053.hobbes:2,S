Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Fix a typo in the code that reserves memory at boot

Hi !
The code that marks memory regions as "reserved" early during boot
has a typo (doing incorrect rounding of the top address) which can
cause some areas to not be properly reserved. That may explain some
cases of initrd corruption reported recently.
