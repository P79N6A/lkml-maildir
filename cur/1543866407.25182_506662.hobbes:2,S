...assuming that's really the problem.
It does seem to me that it is some sort of name resolution issue, but it may
have more to do with the multi-homed nature of your setup.
Did you try:
  mount.cifs //CL0/c /mnt
?
If mount.cifs is not converting the case, that should fix the problem.
Curious to know...
