I vote for 32 bits, *some* ISPs have more than 65536 users, but they can
find others solutions, like using SQL databases for users accounts, if we
use a gid_t of 64 bits its more 32 bits for every gid_t variable, this
will increase up the size of kernel and decresing the speed with a feature
for only a couple of ISPs. IMHO.
