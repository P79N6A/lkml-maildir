It appears that the kernel bk tree is lagging behind the DRM CVS
source. Allow more DRM updates into the kernel and these things will
be fixed. If you want more up to date drivers get them directly from
DRM CVS.
pci_enable/disable_device are correct in the dyn-minor patch. They
also appear to correct in the currently checked in DRM cvs. If fbdev
is loaded DRM does not do pci_enable/disable_device. It is assumed
that these calls are handled by the fbdev device.
You must follow the order rules if using them together.
modprobe fbdev
modprobe DRM
rmmod DRM
rmmod fbdev
You cannot remove these modules out of order or things will break.
