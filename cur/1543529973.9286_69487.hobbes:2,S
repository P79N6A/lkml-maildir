Further down, you say that you don't want him working with the code, but
for him to give us a detailed list of what's broken is only slightly less
work than actually fixing it.  We simply need to go through all the VFS
interface functions, and make them right.

This can't be done.  You want Alexei to fix the checks to make them honor
the same boundary conditions and exceptions that ext2 does, but without
looking at or using ext2 code.

I'm sure we'll be able to work things out when we get there.  There is no
need to start discussions about changes we might be making, especially
when you don't attempt to decribe the changes ;-)
