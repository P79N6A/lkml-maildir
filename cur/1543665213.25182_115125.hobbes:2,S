--param max-inline-insns-single
The fact that this parameter does not get initialized by using
-finline-limit is a bug. A fix for this has already gone into CVS HEAD
(3.4) and is pending for 3.3.

The compiler solely judges by the size of the function to be inlined,
no magic involved.
There are two reasons, why this may not be what you expect:
- The allowable size can get smaller if in the function from that
  you're calling and the one above and ... were already inlined.
  At some moment this recursive inlining has to be stopped to
  not results in excessive compile time resource requirements
- When calculating the size of a function, the compiler counts
  tree tokens, each estimated to yield 10 RTL instructions.
  It does unfortunately not take into account code that will
  be eliminated by optimization (constant propagation, dead
  code elimination, ...) nor does it have a very good idea
  about the size of inline assembly.
