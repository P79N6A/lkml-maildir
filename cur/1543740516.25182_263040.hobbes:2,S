That would be your value-add there - provide the experience in video 
system design to the low-volume (<5000 unit) custom controller market. 
Smaller companies will not have the video experience to implement 
something like this.  You could even bill the PCI cards as "developer 
tools".  You'd just sell a lot of developer cards to *nix people...

I dunno.  That's what market research weenies are paid to do - figure 
out if the market for a product is good enough to justify developement.
If this does work, though, moving the core graphics rendering engine to 
an ASIC would mean that a very small amount of work would be necessary 
to move the core to various bus architectures - even high-end PDA's and 
cell phones are going to need some serious graphics horespower soon, if 
the screens on them keep going like they are.
You also might want to consider marketing "developer kits" that include 
dead-tree documentation, boards, re-branded FPGA tools, and raw chips 
for those looking to do custom work on their own.  I think it'd be fun 
to hack up an ISA graphics card on my own, even if mass production isn't 
feasible :)
It could be marketed to universities needing an undergraduate project in 
hardware design, too - for everything from video BIOS development to PCI 
interfacing to DAC implementation and physical board design.  And the 
students wouldn't need to sign an NDA to get access to the cool new 
hardware...
