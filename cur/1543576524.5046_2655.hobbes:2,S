You're probably aware of this, but SCI allows a lot more then the creation
of windows of shared memory. The IBM NUMA-Q machines (what was Sequent), use
the SCI interconnect to build a single-system image machine with all memory
visible from all "nodes". In fact, all the commercial NUMA machines of which
I am aware have this property (all nodes see and can address all memory). The
non-uniform part of NUMA comes from the potentially differing latency and
speed of different parts of memory (local vs remote in this case).
AFAIK, the work that Kanoj Sarcar has been doing is to enable such machines.
It sounds like you have a different requirement of very high-speed shared
memory between different nodes that can be mapped and unmapped as required.
Do I understand this correctly ? That would make your requirements somewhat
orthogonal to the requirements those of us with NUMA architectures have.

See above. It may be that you need different APIs anyway.
