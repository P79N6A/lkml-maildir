It occurs on my 56K PPP link and Netgear FA310-TX (Digital) Ethernet card
so I'm thinking software.  I've been running a memory test (bzip2/tar/diff
of kernel tree) for 210 iterations and hasn't shown anything, just in case
it was my memory getting bad.

I got the error pinging a machine on the same switch as myself as well as
the machine on the other side of my PPP connection.
It's a bummer when it happens on the PPP connection too. Everything just
dies for 5 seconds or so.
