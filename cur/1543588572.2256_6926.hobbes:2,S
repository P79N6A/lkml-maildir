Right - same behavior here, no APIC errors with 2.2 (as they are not
reported). The ISDN error happens very seldom (4 times last year) and is
not reproducable - which is not so with the eth0 errors (as eth0 locks
at around 500-1000MB while copying data).

Hmmm, so does that mean that those checksum errors have no effect on the
stability of my system?

How did you do that? The BIOS Option only enables the use of MPS 1.4 for
single CPU but I could not find an option for switching between 1.1/1.4.
Is there a way to force the Linux kernel to use 1.4?
Many thanks for your quick answer!
