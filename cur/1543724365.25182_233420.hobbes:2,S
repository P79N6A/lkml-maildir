You guys have refused to apply reiserfs bugfixes for a long time.  Users 
don't know that redhat doesn't apply our bugfixes, and when they use 
redhat and decide to experiment with reiserfs, they encounter bugs and 
conclude that RedHat is right to not support reiserfs, which is exactly 
the redhat intended effect.
Fedora is something new.  It is good that fedora tracks the mainline.  
Kudos for that.  You should do that with RHEL.
