I'll try that, but my K6 is cool, almost cold to the touch when
it is in operation. I have a very large cpu fan on it (yes it is
the right one :)
I will try ripping off the heat transfer pad on the fan and just
use heatsink compound, however.
Do we have any good sucess stories with <350 Mhz K6's and FIC
VA-503+ MB's?  I can't say I've heard one yet with this combo and
Linux.

Some of the, 300mhz k6's were 66Mhz only rated, which is stamped
on the CPU. All of the higher speed CPU's are 100Mhz.
