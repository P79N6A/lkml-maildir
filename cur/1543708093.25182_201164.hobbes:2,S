While on the subject of tempertures,  I found something a bit weird.  In linux 
with C1 disconnects enabled, the system temperature was 36 C.  I rebooted to 
BIOS setup and watched the temperatures there.  For some weird reason, the 
system temperature rose from 36 C, to about 41 C.  And I also watched the CPU 
temp rise from about 41 C to about 51 C !  I boot back into linux, and I watched
the system temperature _drop_ to 36 C again.  What is C1 disconnects disabled 
during POST now on my BIOS?  I have done this before when I first got it and 
never noticed something like this.
