No need.  Just use Acked-By: comments.
Also, can I give some more feedback on the way you publish your patches:
 1. git's replication uses the notion of a forward-only commit list. 
    So, if you change patches or rebase them then you have to rewind
    the base point - which in pure git terms means create a new head.
    So, you should use the convention of putting some identifier - a
    date, or a version number - in each head.
 2. Why do you have a seperate repository for your normal openvz and the
    -ms trees?  You can just you different heads.
 3. Apache was doing something weird to the HEAD symlink in your
    repository.  (mind you, if you adopt notion 1., this becomes
    irrelevant :-))
Otherwise, it's a great thing to see your patches published via git!
I can't recommend Stacked Git more highly for performing the 'winding'
of the patch stack necessary for revising patches.  Google for "stgit".
Sam.
