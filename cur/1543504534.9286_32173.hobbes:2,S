Certain Intel Pentium class chips had a "general flaw" in their
design that gained the nickname "F00F Bug", but Linux manages to
quite successfully work round the said problem. I can see no good
reason why the same shouldn't be true of the flaws in the VFAT
design.

There's no need to introduce additional flaws to the design. I
see the hidden filenames as an additional flaw that needs fixing,
although I agree with Alexander that the case of directories with
dual names needs careful consideration.
Best wishes from Riley.
