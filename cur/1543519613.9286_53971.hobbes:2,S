Not a patch, but I did get it working.  Yesterday I beat the living
_tar_ out of my box and it works perfectly.
The trouble (afaikt) is two fold..
make_request() pulls the wrong queue for a raid device via
	q = get_queue(bh->b_dev)
and then does
	if( !q->plugged )
		(q->request_fn)(q);
which leads directly to do_md_request().
ll_rw_block() contains..
   for (i = 0; i < nr; i++) {
     set_bit(BH_Req, &bh[i]->b_state);
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD
     if (MAJOR(bh[i]->b_dev) == MD_MAJOR) {
        md_make_request(bh[i], rw);
        continue;
     }
#endif
     __make_request(q, MAJOR(bh[i]->b_rdev), rw, bh[i]);
   }
 
.. ie it wants to substitute it's own handling where there is a
handler (raid1/5), but in md_make_request() at the point where
you fall through, you hit make_request() instead of the intended
__make_request().
What I did (because get_queue() and __make_request() are static)
was to clone make_request() and call it make_request_redirect().
It is identical to make_request except it does..
	q = get_queue(bh->b_rdev)  << remember this 'difference'
The workaround (bandaid) in md_make_request() looks like this. 
      err = mddev->pers->make_request(mddev, rw, bh);
   } else {
      extern void make_request_redirect(int,int,struct buffer_head *);
      make_request_redirect (MAJOR(bh->b_rdev), rw, bh);
      err = 0;
   }
Comment out the printk in do_md_request(), apply the same bandaid to
raid1.c and raid5.c and you're done.
I have one tiiiiny little problem with this 'fix'.  If you look at
ll_rw_block() a few lines up from md_make_request(), you'll see..
      /* Md remaps blocks now */
      bh[i]->b_rdev = bh[i]->b_dev;
I <zzzt> don't get it, but <zzzt> it works.  I'll wait for the movie.
