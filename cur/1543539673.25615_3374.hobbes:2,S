Make than "every machine with IDE". Other architectures can send raw IDE

However, most BIOSs have a recovery mode that'll let you replace the
firmware (on my system, you can set a jumper, enabling an emergency bit of
ROM that has just enough BIOS services to let you boot off a floppy and run
the BIOS flash utility). Other hardware tends to have the flash utility
stored within the flash itself (d'oh).
