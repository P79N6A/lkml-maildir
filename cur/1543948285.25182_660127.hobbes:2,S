Hmm, just a random shot (shouldn't be the case, but just to be on the safe 
side) -- could you please try
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
to see whether it removes the segfault by any chance?
I don't know how exactly execution of real-mode code through libx86 works, 
but this might be worth trying before starting the next round of 
bisection.
