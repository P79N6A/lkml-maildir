Well, here it was a case of the standard committee violating the principle
of solving a problem _where_ it exists in the first place. As far as volatile
is concerned, the _language_ itself had absolutely no problems that
needed fixing ...

In fact I wish the standard just left this functionality entirely up to the
implementation.
After all, C (the _language_) does not mandate memory access
reordering / optimization by implementations so dumb compilers
(5.1.2.3:1) that do not do any are still conformant and hence
don't require the volatile extension (5.1.2.3:8). Implementations that
do perform optimization, otoh, _must_ then solve the possible problems
_themselves_ by providing an extension that allows the programmer
to turn it off (wherever necessary) to prevent those side-effects that the
implementation itself brought about by performing optimization in the
first place. That _compiler extension_ could then of course be called
anything (volatile, foo, bar, barrier, ...) and implemented in any way --
whatever is appropriate for that compiler [1].
[ Analogically, C (or any language) does not mandate the hardware
it runs on to reorder / optimize memory accesses. Those that do, must
clearly then also provide instructions like lfence/sfence/mfence as part
of their instruction set to solve potential issues that _their_ behaviour
brings about in the first place. How horribly wrong it would be for a
_language_ to try and go about solving this problem ... ]
So the way I see it, it's just a case of solving a problem _where_ it
exists in the first place.
Satyam
[1] Which begs the question, so if we wished (note past tense here)
to keep generic kernel code compiler-independent, what do we do in
situations where we want to disable _compiler optimizations_ temporarily
for some piece of code? => By defining macros / some API as part of
our codebase in implementation-specific headers that does whatever
needs to be done for _that_ compiler. => Which is precisely what we
have already and why I like/prefer that.
