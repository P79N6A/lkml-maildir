Is the laptop x86 or ppc?  IIRC there were problems with the pte-referenced
handling on ppc?  Or was it ppc64?  It shouldn't make any difference in
this case I guess.
To investigate this sort of thing you're better off using just a local `dd'
to ascertain the pattern which is causing the problem.  Keep things simple.
What happens if you do a 4G writeout with dd?  Is there any swapout?  There
shouldn't be much at all.  If the big dd indeed does not cause swapout,
then what is different about rsync?
