Subject: SCSI problem with 2.2.3

With a 2940UW, 2.2.3 probes 3 disks: sda (2GB HDD), sdb (ZIP) and
sdc (9GB HDD).
I have put linux on sdc but now have a nasty problem: sdc never becomes
"drive 3" (0x82) because sdb isn't installed by the BIOS.  Trying to lilo
it results in a disk which cannot be booted (not that I have been able to
yet anyway).
Can I "wire down" sdb to be the 9GB HDD in the kernel config or tell linux
to make the ZIP drive something other than sdb ?  (If I can't wired down
SCSI addresses to specific drive names then I'd suggest someone take that
on as a project for the future - the BSDs have it, allowing much more
freedom in adding/removing SCSI devices from a chain).  If I need to edit
some table in a kernel .c file, please point the way.
