No -- It's a typo.  CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848_DVB is just an option to 
CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848.  It is a boolean option, and when chosen, Kconfig 
SELECT's CONFIG_DVB_BT8XX, and that's the actual menu item that builds 
the module.
The option is set as bool, so that if it's dependencies are set as 
modules, dvb-bt8xx will also build as a module.  If, however, the 
dependencies are set to build in-kernel, then dvb-bt8xx will do so as well.
Consider this menu item a symbolic link to CONFIG_DVB_BT8XX -- it was 
the only way to add this as a submenu option to VIDEO_BT848, without 
removing the reference in the DVB submenu.
Anyhow, this patch removes the incorrect info:
