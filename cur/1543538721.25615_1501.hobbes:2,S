We do effectively use the same copy (it's the same memory page each time, it's 
just that the contents are refreshed).  The trampoline code must be at a 
physical memory location capable of being accessed by a real mode CPU.  The 
trampoline page is taken and held very early on in the boot sequence for this 
reason.

If you look lower down in do_boot_cpu(), this is used as a diagnosis of a boot 
failure (the check at phys_to_virt(8192)).  If we don't find the signature, we 
know the CPU failed to start, if we do find it, we know it started but got 
stuck somewhere after the switch to protected mode.
In the latter case, the CPU could happily have trashed the trampoline code 
before disappearing off into hyperspace, so it makes sense to set it up anew 
each time.
