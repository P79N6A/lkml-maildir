Yes, it can be made that way. I just made it like that because
system consoles, since they are initialized very, very early, have to
be compiled statically. Therefore, they have can never be unloaded. So
why give them the prerogative to directly unbind, when they can never
be unloaded? One can unbind them anyway by binding a modular driver.
It would also make binding/unbinding a more complicated process.

network is different.  It's a different class of console itself.  We
have different console classes BTW. We have netconsole, serial console,
vt consoles etc. fbcon, vgacon, promcon, etc all fall under the vt
console class.

That was the plan before, the problem here is that we won't have any
output during the early part of the boot process. That's why I
differentiated them into system and modular consoles.

As mentioned above, making vgacon (and other system drivers) take this
pathway means we lose output during the early part.

I was thinking of changing it to something like this, after GregKH's
suggestion:
/sys/class/vtconsole --- vgacon - bind
                     : 
                     --- fbcon - bind
                     : 
                     --- dummycon - bind
... with the 'bind' as a r/w attribute, 0 for unbound/unbind, 1 for
bound/bind. 
What do you think?
