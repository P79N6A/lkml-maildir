Hey, OLS is coming up and I'm wondering if there are people out here who
would be interested in me showing up and answering BK questions, technical
or licensing or otherwise.  Richard Gooch pinged me about the license and
I explained our reasons for why it is the way it is and he urged me to
show up and explain it to a wider audience, I apparently explained things
that weren't well known.  I'm happy to do that, you can bring tomatoes :)
Anyway, I'm reasonably busy so if nobody cares one way or the other, I'll
pass, but if it would to have someone to ask questions of or whatever, it
would be fun.  I could use a break and I enjoyed hanging out with kernel
folks, this SCM stuff gets old after a while...
