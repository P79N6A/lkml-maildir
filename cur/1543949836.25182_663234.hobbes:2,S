Subject: [PATCH BUGFIX -rc3] Smack: Don't register smackfs if we're not loaded
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
Smackfs initialization without an enabled Smack leads to
an early Oops that renders the system unusable.
Introduce a global smack_enabled variable that will be used
to make sure that no smack components will be registered 
(ala smackfs) if we are not already enabled.
Signed-off-by: Ahmed S. Darwish <darwish.07@gmail.com>

The Oops is triggered by the security= patch that will be sent
soon.
I can't imagine an SELinux guru finding /smackfs instead of 
his usual /selinuxfs when he hits a tab completion after 's' ;).
As a bonus, this patch will handle that case too.
