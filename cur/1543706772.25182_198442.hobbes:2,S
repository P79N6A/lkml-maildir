So what ?
Do you think an app that expects utf-8 filenames won't crash today when
served a byte sequence that's invalid UTF-8 ? (or an app that expects
ascii when served utf-8 oddities)
The problem exists now - putting encoding info somewhere of agreeing on
a common convention won't solve the legacy mess. What it will do is
avoid we get stuck the same way in a decade.
As long as an FS is shared by multiple apps/users agreeing on what the
filenames mean exactly should not be revolutionary. And btw I don't care
if it's UTF-8, UCS or something else. I just want a common ground so
peple and apps can communicate sanely.
