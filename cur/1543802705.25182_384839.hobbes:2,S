Yes it could be.  As I understand it, regular file writes (not O_DIRECT) are only to the page
cache and only block when there is memory pressure (so it is more of a throttle).
Reads, on the other hand, could be quite handy.  What might be very cool is if there were a way to
mmap and start faulting in the pages in the background, and get notified as they complete - or
when all the faulting is done.
