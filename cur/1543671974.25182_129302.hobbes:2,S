Well, the vided card does work, but seemingly not after you restart your
X server. You get presented with a black screen after restarting X, and
you can kill the X server from there, so it runs, just doesn't show
anything.
The thinkpad boots, that is no problem. The powersaving has been brought
to my attention as a possible source of problem. I already run it w/o
ACPI, and will try disabling APM as well..
The other thing that has been highlighted to me is that there might be a
problem with idle in the 2.4.20 kernel. I will be trying 2.4.21-rc1 over
the weekend if that works better.
