I wasn't even aware you could do this...
These are the serial ports I have:
ttyS0 at MMIO 0xc8000000 (irq = 15) is a XScale   IXP425 internal
ttyS1 at MMIO 0xc8001000 (irq = 13) is a XScale     "       "
ttyS2 at MMIO 0x53000000 (irq = 21) is a XR16550  XR16L2551
ttyS3 at MMIO 0x53000008 (irq = 21) is a XR16550      "
I tried console=uart,mmio,0x53000000,115200 and my board didn't print
anything to the console and the boot failed somewhere before starting
network (I don't know exactly where or why since I couldn't see any
messages).  Using console=ttyS2,115200 works fine.
What's 8250_early.c for anyway?  console=ttyS... has always worked fine
for me.
