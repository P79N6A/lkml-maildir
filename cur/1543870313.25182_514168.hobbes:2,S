Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure there's been enough information to
conclude that.
At the moment, I'd like a patch which makes backlight usage configurable
at runtime though a module parameter and defaults to off in all cases
except the powermac one. I'd like to get something into the tree,
preferably before the next -rc, since at the moment things are breaking
for people. If you haven't time, say so and I'll have a look and see if
I can work one out.
Cheers,
Richard
