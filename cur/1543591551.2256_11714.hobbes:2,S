It's called the "buffer cache", and Ingo's early page-cache code in
2.3 actually did install page-cache backing buffers into the buffer
cache as aliases, mainly for debugging purposes.
Even without that, though, an application can achieve almost-coherency
via invalidation of the buffer cache before reading it.  And yes, this
won't necessarily remain coherent over the lifetime of the application
process, but then unless the filesystem is 100% quiescent then you
don't get that on 2.2 either.
Which is rather the point.  If the filesystem is active, then
coherency cannot be obtained at the block-device level in any case
without knowledge of the fs transaction activity.  If the filesystem
is quiescent, then you can sync it and flush the buffer cache and you
already get the coherency that you need.
Cheers,
 Stephen
