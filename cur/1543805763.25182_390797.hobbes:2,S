I have an Advantech TPC-1260T touch panel computer. The touch screen
is an RTKC manufactured by Liyitec. The electrical interface of the
touch screen is PS/2, but the protocol does not seem to be PS/2.
Liyitec provides a binary driver for XFree86 on i386-linux, named
tsps2 1.1.0, but I have not been able to find an open source driver.
I'm considering writing my own. Has anyone else started down this
path?
Please cc me in your reply. Cheers!
Shaun
