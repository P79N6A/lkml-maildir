I bet you're hanging on the rtnl_semaphore due to having a /sbin/hotplug
policy.
Miles, mind trying out a really simple change in the
____call_usermodehelper() function in kernel/kmod.c? 
Change: #if 0 out the whole block that says "if (retval >= 0)" and does
the waiting for the child. We shouldn't wait for the user mode helper:
that's just going to cause nasty deadlocks. Deadlocks like the one you
seem to be seeing, in fact.
Does your ifconfig problem go away with that fix?
