Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver core patches for 2.6.13-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/30/11

Here are some small patches for the driver core.  They fix a bug that
has caused some people to see deadlocks when some drivers are unloaded
(like ieee1394), and add the ability to bind and unbind drivers from
devices from userspace (something that people have been asking for for a
long time.)
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
thanks,
