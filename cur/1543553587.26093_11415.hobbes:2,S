Cleanliness.  All other module data flows go via explicit symbols which
are fixed up at link time or via registration functions.  Having a few
sources that use a third mechanism which forces people to use
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS() to make it work is messy and redundant.
I'm not sure why you think this can be used for module persistent
storage.  If a module calls inter_module_register() on load, it should
call inter_module_unregister() on unload.  All the registered data
points into the loaded module, remove the module and the storage
disappears as well.
