Aaah.. DOH! That was just what was lurking in the back of my head, but the
thinking part of the brain didn't quite grasp it. Of course "patch" will
skip "no-patch" text instead of crapping out. Hell, if I'd designed the
"patch" program that behaviour would have been one of the first things to
implement.
Sorry for the LKML spam then =) but ain't it nice with one of these
"easy-to-answer" mails from time to time...?

PS. I really hate OE. Anyone care to recommend THE Windoze Mail+News reader
program, with EXTREME filtering capabilities AND not looking like crap?
