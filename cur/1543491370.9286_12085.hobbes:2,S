That is probably a bug.

But if you are going to add your own compatibility layer anyway for
non-IPv6 systems, why not use the same layer for systems which may or
may not have IPv6?  Call your wrapper ns_socket instead of socket,
ns_socket tries IPv6, if that fails, try IPv4, doing your own V6 to V4
mapping.  Same with ns_getaddrinfo as a wrapper to getaddrinfo etc.

So call your compatibility layer.  Only that layer needs any
conditionals and is required anyway for pure IPv4 systems.  It strikes
me that this is application policy and should be dealt with in the app,
not the kernel.
