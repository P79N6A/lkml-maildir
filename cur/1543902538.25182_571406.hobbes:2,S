Ok, Jens - mind signing off on the patch you sent out, and writing an 
explanatory message? Feel free to just crib from my explanation of my 
original patch, or whatever.
And it would be beautiful if people who saw the bad behaviour before 
reverting the ide.c changes were to go back to that broken state, and try 
the patch, and just verify that it acts like it should (ie you should see 
just a few error messages, and it shouldn't cause the IDE layer to go 
ballistic any more).
