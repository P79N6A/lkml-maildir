I'm sure there's no good reason.

I'm very much hoping that it is not needed.  Would prefer to just toss the
whole thing away.
What's it supposed to do anyway?  Keep wholly-unused pages hanging about in
each slab cache?  If so, it may well be a net loss - it'd be better to push
those pages back into the page allocator so they can get reused for
something else while they're possibly still in-cache.  Similarly, it's
better to fall back to the page allocator for a new slab page because
that's more likely to give us a cache-hot one.
I'm convinced, anyway ;)
