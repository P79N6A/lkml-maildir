In my experience setting the buffer size to a higher value won't do you a
blind good as the problem is not input bound but rather on the output
side.  Heavy disk i/o locks out mpg123's buffer process, therefore
audio_play_samples() doesn't get run often enough. So to me it looks like
mingos additional schedule()s are certainly in the right ballpark. For a
simple test case on sound skippishness, disable DMA on an IDE disk and run
a find on it while playing sound. [Or be the proud owner of any IDE
chipset that wasn't supported in DMA mode prior to unified ide. :-/]
