I have had this problem on several machines to. But not only 
against the swap device. I have 1 machine with a SCSI disk as 
root disk /dev/sda1, the swap device is /dev/sda2. 
Then there is a 4 disk ide raid0 (software raid) mounted 
on /mnt and if i run it there i have the same problem.
This machine is a SMP machine, tho is has also happend
on UP machines.
Hope it helps.
