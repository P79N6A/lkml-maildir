My experience is that USB legacy emulation in BIOS + ACPI works as
long as you do not touch it and gets terribly confused if someone
tries to actually use i8042 (like enable active multiplexing mode with
4 AUX ports). As soon as BIOS takes its dirty hands off i8042
everything works fine.
The problem it seems that when usb-handoff code was moved from pci
quirks and enabled inconditionally something happened so it stopped
doing handoff.
