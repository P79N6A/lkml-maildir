Ok, this is as per some copyright lawyers who know US Copyright law, and
how to defend it in court.  To make it legally binding in the US, so you
can file for a copyright in the proper government agencies (which is
necessary if you want to be able defend your copyright in court in an
easier manner, it's not necessary but it sure helps.) you need the
phrase to look like:
	Copyright (c) <DATE> <COMPANY_NAME>
Note that this is different from the above description of putting a
"(C)" and then the word "Copyright".
Now I have no idea if this is the same for all countries, I only know
what I was told to do.
Hope this helps, and I really don't want to start a big "copyright"
thread, as I'm not a lawyer, I only have to deal with them on a constant
basis :)
thanks,
