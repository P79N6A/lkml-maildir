Subject: [IrDA] Oops with NULL deref in irda_device_set_media_busy

Hello,
I've problems with IrDA - when debug is off, I'm getting oops for obvious 
reason...
(I don't have a log, this is just rewrite from screen:
EIP: irda_device_set_media_busy+0x15/0x40 [irda]
ali_ircc_sir_receive+0x4a/0x70
ali_ircc_sir_interrupt+0x66/0x70
ali_ircc_interrupt+0x5e/0x80
.....
)
When I turn debug on, I get just
Assertion failed! net/irda/irda_device.c:irda_device_set_media_busy:128 
self != NULL
The obvious reason is that I don't have irlap module in that inits 
dev->atalk_ptr, so I'm getting assertion exception in irda_device.c:489.
A few info that could be handy:
