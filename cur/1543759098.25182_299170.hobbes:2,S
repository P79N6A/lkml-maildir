I agree.
But what if the file systems can handle certain errors better than
what the drivers can do now ? Take for e.g., data corruption. If the
driver finds a corrupted sector that it cannot recover, it is going to
convert this specific error in to a more generic error code (-EIO) and
report it to the file system, But the file system might find it is ok
to have a block of data with few corrupted bytes (say, if the block
belongs to a large video file) rather than receive an I/O error code
with no data at all.
What I'm thinking is this: do we have to export richer error codes to
the filesystem from the driver and let the file system handle them as
it thinks appropriate ?
thanks,
