Please do, while it would be nice if OSS could be dropped altogether
there are a great many commercial and closed source apps that we all
need and only currently work with OSS.  For example flash player for
linux and real player, not to mention a myrid of open source apps that
have yet to move to ALSA support.  Right now its virtually impossible to
live with a kernel with no OSS for people like me who require use of
these apps on a daily basis.
