Hi.
Just want to say that I get up to 2.7 on my Acer Aspire 5720Z laptop.

The test program was run with the following frequency setup:
# cpufreq-info
cpufrequtils 002: cpufreq-info (C) Dominik Brodowski 2004-2006
Report errors and bugs to linux@brodo.de, please.
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which need to switch frequency at the same time: 0 1
  hardware limits: 800 MHz - 1.47 GHz
  available frequency steps: 1.47 GHz, 1.07 GHz, 800 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: ondemand, userspace, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 1.47 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 1.47 GHz (asserted by call to hardware).

This seems to be higher than the #60 on your list. What makes my
machine (and a few of the others') special?
