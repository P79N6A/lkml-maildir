Is this desired (but odd) behavior or a bug?
The driver is 3c59x and the kernel is 2.6.13.2 if that is relevant.
eth0 has no information (the driver was just freshly loaded)
# ip route show table main dev eth0
# ip route show table local dev eth0
Bring it up with an address
# ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4
# ip route show table main dev eth0
1.0.0.0/8  proto kernel  scope link  src 1.2.3.4 
# ip route show table local dev eth0
broadcast 1.0.0.0  proto kernel  scope link  src 1.2.3.4 
local 1.2.3.4  proto kernel  scope host  src 1.2.3.4 
broadcast 1.255.255.255  proto kernel  scope link  src 1.2.3.4
Turn it back off
# ifconfig eth0 down
# ping -c 1 1.2.3.4
PING 1.2.3.4 (1.2.3.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.091 ms
--- 1.2.3.4 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.091/0.091/0.091/0.000 ms
The address is still pingable
# ip route show table main dev eth0
# ip route show table local dev eth0
local 1.2.3.4  proto kernel  scope host  src 1.2.3.4
The routing table entry was left behind.
I've had some great paranoid moments with SSH host-key errors thanks to
this quirk.
