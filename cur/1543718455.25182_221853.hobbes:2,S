Congratulate yourself anyhow. It's that type of hero that makes Linux (or open
source in general, for that matter) work as well as it does.  Yes, there's a
core crew of several dozen maintainers (who all deserve our thanks too), but
they can't develop a great operating system in a vacuum - without good bug
reports and the occasional user-provided patch, it all grinds to a halt very
quickly....
(OK, *everybody* who's ever contributed, take a bow now. :)
