How about in the reverse ... being able to have multiple
processes able to dynamically connect to a single existing sigfd 
and listen for a signal?  You said that you want to reserve write()
for sending signals through the sigfd.  If you implement the 
write(sigfd, ...) then this seems to provide a very nice writer/reader
signal deliver interface with well defined end points for the sender 
and receivers.  Or maybe I'm just confused.
