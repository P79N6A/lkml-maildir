I don't see that step 3 (the second!) makes any difference:
it behaves like that whether or not the page is swapped out, doesn't it?
I agree with you that behaviour seems wrong for a private anonymous page.
And we'd agree it's right behaviour for a shared file page.  The case of
a MAP_PRIVATE or !PROT_WRITE file page may be harder to decide, but I'm
inclined to follow you and say distinction should depend on MAP_SHARED
(shm included as MAP_SHARED mapping of unnamed shmem object).
I know nothing of the user/glibc end of futexes, perhaps it makes
your case academic.  But I'd still like a consistent definition
for how sys_futex should behave.
I'd been wondering along similar lines (worried by futex on uninstantiated
anon page, which would end up on the empty zero page), thinking futex.c's
__pin_page ought to pass write flag set to follow_page and get_user_pages.
But now (and I'd like to switch to capitals, but restrain myself) I think
most of the COW/vcache/callback/swap/page/pinning stuff is just a waste
of space and time, creating its own problems which it then has to solve.
When sys_futex passes a uaddr in a VM_MAYSHARE vma, it should be handled
by mapping/index (or inode/offset).  When sys_futex passes a uaddr in a
!VM_MAYSHARE vma, it should be handled by mm/uaddr.  (If outside vma?)
That's it.  Doesn't a whole lot of code and complication fall away?
The physical page is pretty much irrelevant.
For a while I thought this would change the behaviour if futex is
mremapped.  Well, yes, but nobody has remembered to do anything
about vcache in mremap anyway, so it's already broken.
What am I missing?
