Subject: sys_delete_module (NULL) - a bug, or a feature?

Hello.
I've recently noticed that calling sys_delete_module(NULL) (in
kernel/module.c), which is supposed to remove all automatically loaded
modules that aren't used, doesn't always work as expected. It requires
several calls to sys_delete_module to reliably remove all unused modules.
For example, I got the 'lp' device auto-loaded (with parport_pc and
parport). lsmod says:
   Module                  Size  Used by
   parport_pc              5520   1  (autoclean)
   lp                      4616   0  (autoclean)
   parport                 6868   1  (autoclean) [parport_pc lp]
After 'rmmod -a' once, lsmod still says:
   Module                  Size  Used by
   parport_pc              5520   1  (autoclean)
   lp                      4616   0  (autoclean)
   parport                 6868   1  (autoclean) [parport_pc lp]
After another 'rmmod -a', lsmod says:
   Module                  Size  Used by
   parport_pc              5520   0  (autoclean)
   parport                 6868   0  (autoclean) [parport_pc]
And finally, after another try, lsmod happily announces that no modules are
loaded.
Is this a bug? Is this a feature? I don't know.
The reason this happens, however, is the MOD_VISITED flag. It prevents
modules from immediately being released after performing a MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
or MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT on them.
I can't say that I understand why MOD_VISITED is required, and even if this
thing is a feature, I'd love to know what is the reason for it.
Thanks.
