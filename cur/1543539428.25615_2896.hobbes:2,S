Brandon,
does this also occur with kernel 2.2?  If so, could you please try
booting with the `noapic' option.
There is an ongoing trickle of reports concerning APICs simply
forgetting how to generate interrupts.  I have several people who can
reproduce it and it has happened to me once in testing.
I discussed this with Donald Becker the other day - he believes that
it's an APIC programming issue but he hasn't looked into it - his
solution is to use kernel 2.2 with `noapic', otherwise boxes die within
a day or so.
We tend to see it most with network cards because
- they generate the most interrupts
- failure to generate an interrupt on a NIC is non-fatal
- many of the n/w drivers are designed to detect and
  report on this situation.
It is not correlated with shared PCI interrupts.  When it happens,
rmmod/insmod does not clear the condition.
Several of the people who I've dealt with say it happens with 2.3/2.4
kernels but not with 2.2.
It's elusive and nasty.
