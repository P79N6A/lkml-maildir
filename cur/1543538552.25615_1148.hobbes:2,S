   I believe Ted has done so with the WIP e2fsprogs 1.19 currently on
   sourceforge.  i know he intends to release soon, so if there's any
   problems, now would be a good time to tell him.
There's a final snapshot at

Guinea pigs are gratefully welcomed.  Assuming that no one finds any
showstopper bugs, the bits for this WIP release will basically be the
production 1.l9 release.
