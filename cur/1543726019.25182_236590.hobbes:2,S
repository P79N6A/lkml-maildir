That still is an easily predictible value and may not even be 
unique when lots of systems are powered up at the same time
(e.g. after a power failure) 
It would be better to use the hardware random generators that
are available in some southbridges and some CPUs now. I did a patch
a long time ago to automatically seed random from the intel/amd
random driver. Maybe that would be a better solution here? 
Also BTW your problem presents a strong case why compiling in
DHCP probes is bad and such stuff should run from initrd/initramfs.
