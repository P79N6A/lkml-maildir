Yes, that would be cleaner. Not worth it for just x86, but there are
about 6 other arches that use CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR. Do that in one patch
on top of this one and send it to Andrew (who will pull the above into
his tree from Ingo shortly).

No, don't. It's fine the way it is. If INPUT_PCSPKR isn't set, we don't
support the speaker, end of story.
Also, bear in mind that there is a fair amount of lower-hanging fruit
than this, so bouncing a bunch of patches back and forth to make this
perfect is not the best use of people's time.
