It's a dual 1GHz-P3 SMP test box, with three SATA drives.
Each drive has two partitions, and /dev/md0 was RAID5
over the first partitions of each drive (no spares),
and /dev/md1 was RAID over the second partitions (no spares).
Both /dev/md[01] were formatted as ext2, and mounted,
and several processes were running, copying directory trees
back and forth between the two RAIDs, while the MD layer 
was still doing resyncs underneath it all.
Basically, trying really hard to stress everything.

It's only happened the once, so far.  Tell me how you want the code
instrumented, and I'll do it, in case I manage to get it to happen again.
