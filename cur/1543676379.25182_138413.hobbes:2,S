Why ? A VCC is more like a network interface than a TCP
connection.
Worse yet, if you remove the device, it's unlikely that you
can use a new one with the same physical interface before
all the old VCCs are gone. (I.e. you almost always have
things on well-known VCCs, which are associated with physical
devices.)
Removing an ATM device while there are open VCCs isn't a lot
more useful than removing a telephone while there is still a
call in progress :-)
