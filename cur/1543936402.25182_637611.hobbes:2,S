#10 is for cardbus bridges, IIRC.

I believe that the setup-bus code just tried to allocate 1M ROM of some
device using prefetchable window of the bridge 0000:00:00.0. That failed,
probably because there is no MEM space left on the root bus, which is
perfectly OK. Then, the ROM might be successfully allocated in the
non-prefetchable MMIO space.
So, I don't see any problem in this situation. The only thing I could
suggest is to lower the log level in that message from KERN_ERR to
KERN_WARNING...
