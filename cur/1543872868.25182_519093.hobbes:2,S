Ok, this is what I had in mind:
	mount -t container -o ns /dev/namespace
	mount -t container -o cpu /dev/cpu
Lets we have the namespaces/resource-groups created as under:
	/dev/namespace
		    |-- prof
		    |	 |- tasks <- (T1, T2)
		    |    |- container_id <- 1 (doesnt exist today perhaps)
		    |
		    |-- student
		    |    |- tasks <- (T3, T4)
		    |    |- container_id <- 2 (doesnt exist today perhaps)
	/dev/cpu
	       |-- prof
	       |    |-- tasks
	       |    |-- cpu_limit (40%)
	       |
	       |-- student
	       |    |-- tasks
	       |    |-- cpu_limit (20%)
	       |
	       |
Is it possible to create the above structure in container patches? 
/me thinks so.
If so, then accidentally someone can do this:
	echo T1 > /dev/cpu/prof/tasks
	echo T2 > /dev/cpu/student/tasks
with the result that tasks of the same container are now in different
resource classes.
Thats why in case of containers I felt we shldnt allow individual tasks
to be cat'ed to tasks file. 
Or rather, it may be nice to say :
	echo "cid 2" > /dev/cpu/prof/tasks 
and have all tasks belonging to container id 2 move to the new resource
group.
