Subject: RTC (real time  clock) question about sh4 7760

Hi All,
I'm porting linux sh onLogic PD lsh7760-10 board.
The sh4 7760 doesn't have an on chip RTC (while other sh4 processors does), 
and the board I'm working on seems to have no RTC (maybe I2C bus connected).
So in such application I think there is no RTC available; what is the best way 
to describe this? I think to write rtc.c rtc.h modules and write the related 
funcions doing nothing.
Is it correct?
Thanks a lot
Fabio
