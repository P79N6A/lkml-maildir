Yes, you can not free the struct device on your own, you must let the
release function clean it up for you.
Try enabling CONFIG_KOBJECT_DEBUG as well as CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER and see
if that shows you some more clues as to what you are doing wrong here.
And please let me know what you find, in talking to Ingo, I need to find
all the "wrong cases" that this code is being used in to try to make it
easier to prevent this from happening again.
