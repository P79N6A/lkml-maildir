pci_device_tables are (and must be) at per-driver granularity.  Sure the 
same card can have multiple drivers, but that doesn't really matter in 
this context, simply because I/we cannot break that per-driver 
granularity.  Any solution must maintain per-driver granularity.

Well, the step I wish to take - moving the ids from location X to 
location Y, would have no effect on that scenario, positive or negative.
