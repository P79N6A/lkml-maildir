Subject: [RFC] Little endian Cramfs on big endian machines?

At the moment the cramfs code in 2.4 & 2.5 uses the native machine endianness
for the filesystem layout. I believe this behaviour has been considered a bug
and that the code changed such that the filsystem is always little endian.
There is some code in CVS at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cramfs
 which
implements this for 2.4. I tried it a couple of months ago and it seemed OK, but
it breaks backwards compatibility with old filesystems on big endian systems so
I suspect it would never be done in a stable kernel series like 2.4. Should
these changes be merged into 2.5?
