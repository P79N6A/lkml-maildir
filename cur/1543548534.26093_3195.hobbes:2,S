*sigh*
People don't use their machine to run `hdparm -t` all day.
They use their machine for different things, and user
perceived latency varies wildly between different loads
users put on the machine...

Why do you always come up with impossible examples?
If you had any realistic example I'd be inclined to
believe your argument, but this is just not realistic
enough to be taken seriously ...

Not for 10 minutes no, but even with the latency set to 100
and 100 I sometimes get /bad stalls/ in just one or two
processes (while the rest of the system happily runs on).
On the other hand, when I do something different with my
machine, the settings 250 and 500 (or even higher) give
perfectly fine latency...
By applying a /different/ IO load, the same settings with
the current elevator tuning give wildly different results.
What I'd like to see is an elevator where the settings set
by the user have a direct influence in the behaviour observed.
Doing time-based request sorting should give us that behaviour
and a default of say 1/2 second would work fine for all the
hard disks and cdrom drives I've seen in the last 6 years.
Of course you can dream up an imaginary device where it won't
work, but in that case there's always the possibility of tuning
the elevator (like we do right now) ...
regards,
Rik
