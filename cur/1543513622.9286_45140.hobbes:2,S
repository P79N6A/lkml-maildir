Some suggestions:
Could you find out exactly what the CMOS Setup reports regarding memory?
Also what it says about EDO, and what it says about SDRAM. Does it say
60ns - if so, where? 
In the Chipset Features Setup, do you have an Auto Configure option? Is
this disabled? if so, try enabling it - and make a note of any changes.
then see what happens...
Do you have POST (Power On Self Test) disabled? If so, re-enable it,
this will tell you if you have a hardware problem. You should have "Halt
On" (under CMOS Setup) set to "All errors" and "Quick POST" (under BIOS
Features Setup) set "Disabled"
A lack of 72pin slots != SDRAM. EDO DRAM is also manufactured in 168pin
DIMMs, and your board supports these - but obviously only at FSB of
66MHz.
SDRAM also comes in 66MHz and 133MHz DIMMs - but of course with a p2 400
you're stuck at 100MHz bus. Can you try the DIMMs in another machine
running at 66MHz bus speed and see if they work?
Hope this helps,
Andy
