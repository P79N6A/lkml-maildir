I just tried pci=routeirq here, doesn't help.
Another thing I'm seeing sometimes on resume is that the last key pressed on the
keyboard appears to be "stuck". This laptop has a function to ask for a password
on powerup/resume, which presumably is done by the BIOS while in SMM. Since the
last key pressed is ENTER, and I tend to resume into X with an XTerm window
focused, I see the ENTER keypress being repeated for ever, until I hit ENTER
again.
I haven't seen this in any other kernel version, so I'm just mentioning it here
in case it might be relevant.
