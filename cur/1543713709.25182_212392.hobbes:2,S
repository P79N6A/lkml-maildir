I believe its so that we update the data in the cache, and avoid writing
it back to disk unnecessarily - consider the case where you have a lot
of tty activity (which updates atime).  You don't particularly want to
be committing atime updates to disk every, what, 5 seconds, or performing
the NFS operations for the same.
The above is my understanding of the situation, which comes from when I
looked into these issues back in 2.0.3x days on a root-NFS machine and
asked (iirc) Alan Cox about it. - in other words, don't attach too much
reliability on it. 8)
[And for those who don't know - why are tty atimes updated in the
first place?  For 'w' 'finger' etc which report login idle times
( := now - tty atime ).]
