Maybe because it automatically deactivates the Linux extensions if the 
autoconfiguration sees broken include files. Did you see something like:
checking if Linux include file linux/ext2_fs.h is broken... yes
checking if Linux include file /usr/src/linux/include/linux/ext2_fs.h is broken... yes
checking if Linux include file scsi/scsi.h is broken... no
checking if Linux include file /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h is broken... no
checking if Linux include file scsi/sg.h is broken... no
checking if Linux include file /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h is broken... no
Warning: *** /usr/src/linux/include contains broken include files ***
Warning: *** /usr/src/linux/include is not used this reason ***
Warning: This may result in the inability to use recent Linux kernel interfaces
Warning: *** linux/ext2_fs.h is not usable at all ***
Warning: *** This makes it impossible to support Linux file flags ***
You may try to compile using 'make COPTX=-DTRY_EXT2_FS'
