We have this code in psmouse-base.c ...
        if (psmouse->pktcnt == 3 + (psmouse->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS)) {
                psmouse_process_packet(psmouse, regs);
                psmouse->pktcnt = 0;
                goto out;
        }
..or am I misreading it?
I will check what can be done with 0xAA 0x00 before we decide to rescan 
later this evening.
