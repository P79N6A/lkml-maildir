Please don't overload setattr with this.  Just looking at your callers
shows that it's much cleaner as a separate method.
Now what's really lacking is a desciption _why_ you actually need it
to start with.  The current method to set security labels is through
the security.* xattrs.  Now if we want to clean up that somewhat
messy method that might be a good idea, but we should do it for all
callers and not just some.

An any inotify/dnotify additions should be separate from the vfs to
filesystem interface.  Please make it a separate patch and describe
properly why it's needed in it's description.
