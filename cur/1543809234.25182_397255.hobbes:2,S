Subject: [PATCH] deprecate the kernel_thread export
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/14/344

Announce that the kernel_thread export will be removed in half a year,
after all it's users have been converted to the kthread_ API, which I
plan to do over the next month.
(and no, Adrian, please no __deprecate_as_module yet, there's still
 too many users left)

+---------------------------
+
+What:	remove EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_thread)
+When:	August 2006
+Files:	arch/*/kernel/*_ksyms.c
+Why:	kernel_thread is a low-level implementation detail.  Drivers should
+        use the <linux/kthread.h> API instead which shields them from
+	implementation details and provides a higherlevel interface that
+	prevents bugs and code duplication
