Just to reinforce...
sata_nv support and bug fixes are primarily done right now through the 
valiant efforts of Robert Hancock (with assists from Alan, Tejun, and 
others).
Robert's job is difficult, because he has no hardware documentation[1], 
and NVIDIA does not seem to be helping out much with driver bug reports 
on the lists or in bugzillas.
As far as I know, I am the only one in the universe outside of NVIDIA 
with any SATA docs at all, and those docs _only_ cover ADMA registers 
and DMA structures, no PCI config info, no errata, nothing on SWNCQ or 
legacy IDE (well, half a page).
NVIDIA has indeed become more engaged in sata_nv in recent times, and 
that's a positive sign.  You, Kuon and Ayaz have all been noticeably 
more responsive in email.  Thanks.  Users have definitely benefited, 
particularly from your help addressing a couple SWNCQ issues.
But at this point in time, being asked to choose between sata_nv and 
ahci is no choice at all.  One has public documentation, wide industry 
support and little-or-no bugs.  The other has several open issues, no 
documentation, and support obstacles.
