That would definitely be better than what we have now, however I
would still question the true security of it.  DVD was cracked.  
Granted, the usefullness of it is several orders of magnitude
higher than someone cracking a firmware key, but if implemented
poorly, it could happen.  The thing is there is no way of really
knowing if it is implemented well.  I guess I'd rather know it
does try to filter the firmware updates, and trust it though than
have nothing and have easily damageable hardware.
