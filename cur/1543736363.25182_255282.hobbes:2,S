yep, speed isn't my worry, my worry is a misconfigured /etc/fstab wiping
out a filesystem...
If I didn't worry about wiping out a filesystem, then using cryptoloop
would be easier than to interface cryptoapi inside the swap methods to
leave the header in cleartext, so that it can be still checked for a
magic number before starting writing into it. (plus interfacing swap
with cryptoapi makes suspend/resume life easier too)
