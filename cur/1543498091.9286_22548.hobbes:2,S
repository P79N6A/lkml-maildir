    I don't know if 8mb is as much trouble as 4mb machines.  Mastodon,
    which admittedly isn't the most feature-ridden distribution on the
    planet, fits the whole kitchen sink installer [1] into approximately
    7 mb of core (this is kernel + 2400k ramdisk + libc4 + pcmcia
    modules + cardmgr + ksh) and a 1.44mb bootdisk;  4mb, on the other
    hand, just barely fits the installer in before it runs out of memory
    and performs the traditional Linux reenactment of a traveller
    encountering a basilisk along the road.

    Well, once you start up a shell and run a script to ask about firing
    up swap, you've eaten as much core as you would have just dropping
    directly into a moderately well-written installer program [2].
