I forgot to add:
Even after a xfs_repair sometimes another directly following run of
xfs_check or xfs_repair finds errors.
Currently I have problems deleting files from lost+found:
rm: cannot remove directory `lost+found//2171932973': Directory not
empty
I ran xfs_check only a few hours ago and it did not show any output
(which is good).
