    Probably it won't do. If the zombies are there due to a signal
delivery problem, sending a SIGCHLD to the parent will (probably)
solve the problem. But the common case is that the parent is screwed
up or simply so badly programmed that the only way of getting rid of
the zombies is to kill the parent...
    Anyway I suppose that sending the SIGCHLD won't do any harm so it
may be worth trying.
