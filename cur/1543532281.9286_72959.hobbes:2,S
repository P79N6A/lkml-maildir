The swap page is preserved on disk as long as you don't write to the 
copy in memory.  In other words, if you have dirty data in your process
anonymous pages and those pages get swapped out, then subsequent 
swap ins due to read accesses of the same data will effectively mmap
the swap page into memory: as long as the contents of memory match
what is on the disk, we keep both around.  As a result, we can swap
the data out of memory without any further IO if we need to make more
space.  Only once the copy in memory gets modified do we release the
copy on disk.
