Wouldn't we be better off just more fully documenting the English
error messages, though, and possibly translating that explaination
document in to as many languages as possible?  A lot of people search
for error messages strings in the LKML archives, and variations of the
same string will hinder this.
On a related note, if we are going to make a dmesg interpreter and
translator, could we include the ability to generate a kernel .config
from the boot time output?  Note, I don't mean re-create the .config
that the kernel was compiled with, but something like NetBSD, (at
least), which lets you boot with a kernel that has drivers that you
don't need, and generate a config file which will compile a kernel
which contains only those that are actually needed.
John.
