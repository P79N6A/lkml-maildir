Subject: test5-pre5 -- Output not going to VT (append="console=ttyS2,115200 console=tty0").

After reading the serial-console.txt info in linux/Documentation,
I added the append="console=ttyS2,115200 console=tty0" to my lilo
entry and reran lilo.  Everything appears to work on the serial
port end, but all I get on the VT window is a few initial lines
of output about the kernel being decompressed and then I eventually
get a login prompt.
Am I doing something wrong or has this functionality been broken
in the development kernel?
Thankyou,
	Miles
