Will try that in case that fixes the problems I see.

Would you think that the problems I have been seeing with a Radeon
Mobility LY on kernel 2.4.2[01] could be down to exactly these issues as
well?
The problems are that the X server can be started only once and that
there seems to be a chance of it locking the machine hard at start after
that, especially after unloading the radeon.o module.
I will do more testing on that to find out exactly what does what, but
would 2.5.69 be a good test to see what has been fixed?
