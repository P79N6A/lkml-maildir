The documents title is: "Information Technology - SCSI / ATA translation (SAT)
The revision I'm looking at is R08 - the most current I could find. I'll have 
to dig, but it doesn't appear to just be a rewrite of CAM from the quick once 
over I gave it.

Yes, true. After all Linus has said that there is to be no more breaking of 
userspace interfaces. In this case I think what the layer would do is allow 
the people that want to to use /dev/sg* to access all SCSI and ATA devices on 
a given system.
It's purpose, from the blurb on t10.org, is to provide a SCSI interface to ATA 
disks for people that want to access them that way.

Right. Which is one reason why I did say that I thought it might be a good 
idea, but didn't think that anyone would bother. I also don't think it's 
really necessary. SG_IO happens to work great and the amount of work 
involved...
Anyway, to me it seems like it'd just be resurrecting a deprecated module and 
expanding it so it has a wider scope. Only real difference would be that it 
wouldn't take devices from their driver, just provide a second interface to 
it - which also means that all the ATA drivers would need to have hooks that 
it could call into. (Or am I over thinking it here?)

Well, FreeBSD implements CAM, so if someone implemented CAM that'd provide 
source-level compatability. In this case what it would do is hard to say - 
the only thing I can think it _might_ do is quiet a couple of people down a 
bit.

Ah, yes. I was under the impression that libata only handled PATA and SATA - 
is it going to be expanded to encompass the entire ATA bus?

Well, from some comments he made in private mails he seems to think he was 
promised (by Linus, no less) that the DMA problems in ide-scsi were going to 
be fixed. Instead the module was deprecated and SG_IO was introduced - this 
seems to be one of the things he's been angry about.
