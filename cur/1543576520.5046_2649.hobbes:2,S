This is discussed in the Documentation/Changes file, in a given kernel's
source. Brief summaries follow (which assume you're using an x86 CPU).

gcc 2.7.2.3 is safest, but egcs 1.1.2 should be safe even for
mission-critical stuff. gcc 2.95.2 seems to work for many people, but
isn't necessarily safe.

egcs 1.1.2 is the safe choice, but gcc 2.95.2 seems to work. gcc 2.7.2.3
miscompiles 2.4 more often than not, so 2.4 has a preprocessor check that
stops any attempts to compile it with 2.7.2.3.
