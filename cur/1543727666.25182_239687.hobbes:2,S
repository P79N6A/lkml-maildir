Hi,
thanks for your feedback.

You are right. After inserting some debug messages I found out that in 
function cdrom_open_write CDC_RAM is initially set. The function 
cdrom_is_random_writable sets ram_write to 0 and therefore CDC_RAM 
gets masked out later. cdrom_is_random_writable calls 
cdrom_get_random_writable and there cdi->ops->generic_packet returns 
-5 (-EIO?). But I have no idea what to do in this case.
