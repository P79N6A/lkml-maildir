mutt can provide a path for a recovering pine addict.  I did that a
number of years ago and have been quite happy since.  I can't vouch for
its IMAP speeds (seems to be fast enough for me, as long as I don't try
to do a filter on a large IMAP folder), but the other tasks you do
(selecting, piping, etc.) work very well.
I even think there's a mutt config file that duplicates all of the
default pine keystrokes just to make moving easier.
The message threading was reason enough for me to switch, although I've
heard rumors that pine can handle that now.
thanks,
