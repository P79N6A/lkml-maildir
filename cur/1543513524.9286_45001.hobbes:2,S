One of features of tulip is how many different variants of the tulip
chip is handles.  But it isn't just the different pci-ethernet
variants (eg 21140,21143, pnic, etc...), but also the physical
interfaces: mii, sym, serial, etc.... Then throw in EEPROM formats,
different assignments of hardware control bits, etc...
That's a big space to cover in one driver. All of this makes tulip
relatively large and complex as drivers go. IIRC, the source is
100k+.  And it has *worked* for me quite well. However I'm on the more
modern hardware that gets the most attention. Testing for side effects
against older hardware under these circumstances is at once tedious
and difficult.
