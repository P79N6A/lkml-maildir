Yes, the compression will be better. But the implementation will be more 
complicated.
We can try to use the "bound" functions to predict how many bytes to 
pass to the deflate's input, but there is no guarantee they'll fit into 
the output buffer. In this case we'll need to try again.
Possibly, we may do something like this:
Try good compression using the prediction technique.
If we didn't fit the output buffer, use the old but determined algorithm.
