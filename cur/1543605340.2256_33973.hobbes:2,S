There is a significant enough portion of Xircom cards that have that
particular quirk, that relegating the option to a not-enabled-by-default
setting would mean some people's cards flat out don't work by default
with the driver.  Ugly user support issue, even if it is easily solved.
I am hoping that Ion's changes make unconditional promisc mode
unnecessary..
