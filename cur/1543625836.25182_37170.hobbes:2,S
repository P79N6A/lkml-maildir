Just to throw this out there.  Is it possible to make the ide subsystem look
like a scsi controller ?  that way the scsi layer could insert/remove
devices.  say: ide0/1 = scsi0 (assuming no other scsi controllers) and hda =
scsi0 channel0 id0 lun0  and hdc = scsi0 channel1 id0 lun0 ...
Personally, if it's doable, i'd like it.
