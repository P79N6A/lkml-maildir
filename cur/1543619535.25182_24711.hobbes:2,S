Actually, since the page cache hash table is also 8 bytes
per page, the radix trees effectively remove 16 bytes per
struct page.
Also, Momchil's radix trees are only as deep as needed
for each file, so most files should have very shallow
radix trees.
Combine these two facts with min_readahead and you'll
see that the memory consumption for radix trees should
be pretty decent.
It's still a question whether we'll want to use 128 as
the branch factor or another number ... but I'm sure
somebody will figure that out (and it can be changed
later, it's just one define).
regards,
Rik
