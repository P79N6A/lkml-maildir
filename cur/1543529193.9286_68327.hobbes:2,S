And how is mentioning a machine as i386 when asking about Linux kernel code not
specific? And how would saying ix86 making it more specific?

So when a BIOS setting in one way can make something possible and in another
way make it non-possible makes it dependant on the BIOS, whether it is used or
not. That is the problem.

Uhm ... I don't get what you mean? When a BIOS has ISA PNP code in it it goes
out and initializes the cards in a way well described in the Plug-and-Play-HOWTO
where I didn't see any mentioning of card-position being relevant and I would 
be very surprised if it did, but please elaborate if you want to.
Further, I have no knowledge about Microsoft's products and I believe the ISA 
PNP specs were produced by Microsoft, Intel and Compaq in unison. It is a hack
of an outdated bus, yes, but it is unfortunately something some of us are stuck
with and hope to make work in a useful way.

My mistake, I am sorry. When I said "PNP code" I meant Linux kernel PNP code,
which is dependant on BIOS settings, if any change of the settings there will 
affect how the kernel is able to work. At least that is how I interpret the
meaning of the word "dependant".

Again, I am sorry I didn't specified that I meant Linux kernel PNP code when I
said PNP code. I would hope that after the Linux kernel PNP code finishes with
its initial resource management, all drivers that need access to for example
physical devices would be able to get them from the Linux kernel PNP code as a
service, instead of having to query the actual device itself. Otherwise I don't
see the purpose of PNP in the kernel?
All in all, it would be great if the kernel could start over with initializing
all hardware devices, possibly with a 'good start guess' from what was there
previously if it for example was an i386 with a PNP BIOS, but not limited to
that. When all devices were initialized, drivers that needs access to a device
would ask Linux kernel PNP for it and never know if it was a PCI, AGP, ISA, VME
or SBUS device for all I care.
Or is this not what PNP support and resource management in the Linux kernel 
was meant to be?

Good joke :-) (You are joking, right? :-) My machine is a 233MHz P5)
Thank you very much,
