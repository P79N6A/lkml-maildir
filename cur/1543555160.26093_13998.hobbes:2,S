Because you're only supposed to use it if the task that is scheduled:
	A) Doesn't care about a reasonable delay
	B) Doesn't sleep for an unreasonable amount of time.
As long as there's some value of 'reasonable' to match the set of tasks
which you are using schedule_task() for at any given moment, you should be
fine.
If it's really necessary in 2.5, we can consider using multiple queues to
get round this problem - either a task per subsystem or a pool of worker
threads. Hopefully it won't be necessary though. We'll see.

Cool. I was going to look into that. I had figured we should fix it
completely or not at all, though, which is why I didn't do the trick with
use counts. I probably should have done, though.
While you're in maintenance mode, do you feel like fixing up stuff to use
up_and_exit() for killing kernel threads? I started on net/sunrpc/sched.c
but it made my head hurt so I gave up and started hacking PCMCIA
instead :)
Also, drivers/usb/hub.c can probably use schedule_task() now instead of
its own kernel thread.
