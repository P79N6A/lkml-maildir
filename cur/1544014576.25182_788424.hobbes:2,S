As it stand now it:
1) breaks sparc32 build
2) causes regression with distcc/ccache use when MODVERSIONS are enabled
3) the concept is under discussion
So I will have to revert it somehow.
I will look into during a partial revert though as your patches had some stuff
in them I like to keep or which does not harm (genksyms change for instance).

But if only on-disk size is your primary concern then another patch
of Jan Engelhardt would be a bigger win:
build: install modules compressed

It does not decrease the size of vmlinux but the > 1000 modules are compressed.
The patch will in some form be present in kbuild-next.git when I open up
for that.
