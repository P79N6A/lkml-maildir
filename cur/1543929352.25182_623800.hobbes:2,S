Thanks, have now updated the comments.

Can't hurt, I added a sentance to it.

Oops, yes, I ment to do that, thanks for pointing out I missed it.  Now
fixed.

Good idea, now done.

No, let's keep what we have there on the cleanup path for now.  I have
enough work to clean up the initializion part of the api for now :)
Here's the updated patch, thanks for the review comments.

Subject: kobject: add kobject_init_ng, kobject_add_ng, and kobject_init_and_add functions
This is what the kobject_init and kobject_add functions are going to
become.  Add them to the kernel and then we can convert over the current
kobject_init and kobject_add users before renaming it.
Also add a kobject_init_and_add function which bundles up what a lot of
the current callers want to do all at once, and it properly handles the
memory usages, unlike kobject_register();
And we mark kobject_cleanup() as static, as no one outside of the
kobject core uses it, nor should they ever.
