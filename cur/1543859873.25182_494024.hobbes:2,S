I think fixing this up for blocksize < pagesize is an absolute requirement
to get things merged.  We don't need more filesystems that are crippled
on half of our platforms.
Note that recording delayed alloc state at a page granularity in addition
to just the buffer heads has a lot of advantages aswell and would help
xfs, too.  But I think it makes a lot more sense to record it as a radix
tree tag to speed up the gang lookups for delalloc conversion.
