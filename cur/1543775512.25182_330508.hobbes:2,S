This seems related to 2.4 -> 2.6 HZ change.

"ticks" delay should be expressed using HZ
#define IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY  HZ/20
for 50msec delay (N.B. the comment in the code about default delay
being 50msec also seems wrong - it was more like ~33msec in 2.4)
Could you please test if this fixes your problems?
