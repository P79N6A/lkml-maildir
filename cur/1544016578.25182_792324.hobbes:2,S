Indeed, DMA to/from the stack is not allowed (on some platforms it may 
invalidate other data in the same cache line, etc. which is likely what 
you are seeing). Assuming that the USB core is DMAing directly to/from 
that memory, it's a bug in that mcs7830 driver.

Yes, as long as the DMA mapping API is used properly to map the buffer 
(which I'm assuming it is, not being a USB core expert.) GFP_DMA is not 
intended for this, drivers should not be using that flag, unless maybe 
they are doing ISA transfers which is not the case with USB.
