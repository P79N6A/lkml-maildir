This looks like an old kernel on your NetWinder.  Later 2.4 kernels
should get this right (by marking the pages uncacheable in user space.)
However, when I tried this program, it seemed to have some unexpected
results, sometimes claiming that its too slow, sometimes that the
store buffer isn't coherent, and sometimes saying that the cache
isn't coherent.
Oddly, davem's cache aliasing test program works every time.
It's something which I need to look into, but I don't know when I'm
going to find the time to delve into the memory management stuff.
