With the old gregkh-all-2.6.15.patch, I have:
sh-3.1# cat /sys/class/input/input1/modalias
input:b0011v0002p0004e0000-e0,1,2,k110,111,112,113,114,r0,1,8,amlsfw
sh-3.1# echo "add" >/sys/class/input/input1/uevent
sh-3.1# cat /events/1663
PHYSDEVPATH=/devices/platform/i8042/serio0

i.e., there is the "modalias" file in sysfs but no $MODALIAS in the 
environment. Is this the problem that your patch solves (note: I haven't 
tried it yet)?
