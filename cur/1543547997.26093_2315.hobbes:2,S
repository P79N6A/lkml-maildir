The 'problem' is a bunch of stupid American politics (excuse anyone
American), than passed a law that all spam containing a remove adress is
legal. 
So that means I get all kinds of spam containing 'This is legal because
blahblah Bill blablah'
Well, I don't live in the US, and that bill is not legal here.
I basically block the entire IP after receiving SPAM. It the domein is
proven to be 'spam-only', then I just block the entire domain as well.
AOL is next on my TODO list.

I get 10 a day or so.
