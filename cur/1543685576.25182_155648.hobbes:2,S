I did some time ago, and it seems to reduce the code size greatly,
but then I noticed some problems with the memory allocator and
switched back to -O2 for fear that changing the inlining policy
could lead to instability.
I still see those memory allocator problems, so I think I could
safely switch back to -Os now... actually I would recommend it
for all embedded targets.
