If they really are equivalent, you have certainly found a bug.
Examining the code in i2o_config.c, it is expected that the q_in argument 
ranges from 0 to I2O_EVT_Q_LEN-1, but the result of MODINC can never 
be 0, and may equal I2O_EVT_Q_LEN, overindexing the array member 
event_q and clobbering all the remaining members (including q_in).
The correct fix appears to be 
  #define MODULO_INC(x,y) ((x) = ((x)+1)%(y))
