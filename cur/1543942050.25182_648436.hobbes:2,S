Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: fix iret exception recovery
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This change broke recovery of exceptions in iret:
	commit 72fe4858544292ad64600765cb78bc02298c6b1c
	Author: Glauber de Oliveira Costa <gcosta@redhat.com>
	    x86: replace privileged instructions with paravirt macros
The ENTRY(native_iret) macro adds alignment padding before the iretq
instruction, so "iret_label" no longer points exactly at the instruction.
It was sloppy to leave the old "iret_label" label behind when replacing
its nearby use.  Removing it would have revealed the other use of the
label later in the file, and upon noticing that use, anyone exercising
the minimum of attention to detail expected of anyone touching this
subtle code would realize it needed to change as well.
