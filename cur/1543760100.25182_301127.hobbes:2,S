What about the case (as highlighted in previous discussions) that the
stable tree needs a simple "dirty" fix, whereas mainline takes the
complex "clean" fix?
From what's been said above, this means that the stable tree doesn't
get the simple "dirty" fix, because that isn't what's been accepted
into mainline.  However, it could take the complex "clean" fix, but
that may have too high an impact.
