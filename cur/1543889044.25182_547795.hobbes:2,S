I updated my Asus P5B Deluxe BIOS with no luck (this latest BIOS is about 1 
month old). Still no power states. I would be nice to know if _any_ desktop 
C2D mobos have these C-states? (In x86_64 system).
I think I never mentioned:
I'm using 2.6.21.1 (actually gentoo-sources-2.6.21-r1)
My CPU is E6400.
