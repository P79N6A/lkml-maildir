Just one: any fs that really cares about completion callback is very likely
to be picky about the requests ordering. So sync_buffers() is very unlikely
to be useful anyway.
In that sense we really don't have anonymous buffers here. I seriously
suspect that "unrealistic" assumption is not unrealistic at all. I'm
not sufficiently familiar with XFS code to say for sure, but...
What we really need is a way for VFS/VM to pass the pressure on filesystem.
That's it. If fs wants unusual completions for requests - let it have its
own queueing mechanism and submit these requests when it finds that convenient.
Stephen, you probably already thought about that area. Could you comment on
that?
