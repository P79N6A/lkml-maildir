Wouldn't it be better to just temporarily disable softlockups for the
duration?

Doesn't this mean that if one CPU gets locked up, it will be undetected
so long as some other CPU is making progress?
I have another pair of softlockup patches in which I try to address:
    * ignoring time stolen by hypervisors
    * threads going to sleep tickless for long periods of time
I could easy add a "global disable" function, which would allow long
sysrq messages, and it would help Thilo with his long flash update freezes.
