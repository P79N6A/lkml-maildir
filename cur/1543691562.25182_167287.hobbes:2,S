Different hardware, possibly similar problem.
I'm using the cmipci driver for sound.  On a 2.4.18 kernel, CD audio
is mixed fine from the analogue cable.
On a 2.5.75 kernel, I don't hear anything from the analogue input.
There is a CD audio mixer setting, but adjusting it doesn't produce any sound.
Therefore I have digitally rip CDs to play them on 2.5.75, but not on 2.4.18.
Cheers,
