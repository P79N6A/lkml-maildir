Oh my... We can't simply release another v2.2.xx kernel with disfunctional
NFS/KNFSD. Nobody in their right mind doing Linux<->Not-Linux NFS 
have any particular trust in Linux NFS any longer, and if we continue
releasing broken NFS, people will shy away to *BSD or even commercial
Unices. If I knew anything about NFS-programming, I'd help, but sadly
enough, I don't, and I just haven't got the time right now to study the
NFS spec's.
But I just don't see a v2.2.14 with non-working KNFSD as worth releasing,
considering that fixed NFS/KNFSD was one of the major things that #14 would
bring...
It bad enough that Linux NFSv2 write performance is so f**king bad, but if
it's getting a read-performance of 4k, then... Bugger!
