Hi!
I'm the new maintainer for aci.c and the dependent files including
radio-miropcm20.c. (Thanks to Markus Kuhn and Ruurd Reitsma.)
The patch is for 2.4.0-test8 and makes the aci lowlevel driver working
again!
During testing with test8 I found a bug in soundcard.c. The second
file is a patch for this issue.
Changes:
aci.c
-general clean-up and rewrite of aci.c for 2.4.x
-added SMP safe locking
-ioctl pointer bugfix
-added (OSS-limited) equalizer support
-better distinction of PCM1/PCM12/PCM20 for good
 mixer-labeling/mic-preamp/output-amplification handling
-threw mad16 dependence away: no mixer-number hack anymore
-'solo' mode doesn't need some private ioctl() anymore
radio-miropcm20.c
-removed unclear volume handling (maybe I add it later again)
-added stereo/corrected mute handling
-tune-ioctl() pays attention to different aci-versions
-change to TUNER_LOW for 50kHz steps
-integrated lowlevel RDS routines, currently only for 
 finegrained signal strength value
other changes
-documentation updates/corrections
Just to say something about stable/development kernels:
The current aci-driver is old (from 2.0.x), broken, has some bugs and
can crash the kernel.
The patch makes it working, fixes known bugs, makes important updates
to fit into 2.4.x and touches nothing in the mm code... [-:
Ciao,
	Robert
PS: Additional RDS code is in heavy development.  (:
