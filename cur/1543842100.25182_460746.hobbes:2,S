I have 2 computer with 2 different Asrock
(
http://www.asrock.com/product/775Dual-880Pro.htm
) boards, both have a
VIA8237 and a VIA SATA, and both are quirked wrongly, when I use kernels
2.6.17+ . 
And if I haven't bought this 2 computers in a supermarket, I won't be
here discussion this subjects.
So I like to remember  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/28/264
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/4/111
 ( that confirm a VIA SATA on XT-PIC
mode ) 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/1/106
 )
So VIA SATA needs my patch or Daniel Drake patch to _WORK_ .
Adding my patch to Daniel Drake patch ( that is already on -mm series )
could be a reasonable solution.
Patch for 2.6.18-rc5-mm1
