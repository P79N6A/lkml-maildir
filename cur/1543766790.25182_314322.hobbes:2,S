I think this might help clarify:  no membership change is applied to the
lockspace on any nodes until the lockspace has first been suspended on
all.  Suspending means no locking activity is processed.  The lockspace on
all nodes is then told the new membership and does recovery.  Locking is
then resumed.
If some lock message from a failed node is somehow still in the network
and arrives at one of the lockspace members now running again, it will
simply be ignored when they see it's from a non-member node.

Yes, but the messages discussed in that context are a part of group
multicasts.  Specifically, one message from a particular processor needs
to be delivered on all other processors, and all processors must agree on
the order of that group message with respect to membership changes.  To do
that you do indeed need to employ VS algorithms.
I know you're more familiar with those details than I am.  What I keep
trying to explain is that the dlm is in a different, simpler category.
The dlm's point-to-point messages (think client-server on a per lock
basis) just don't require the same rigorous approach used for _group_
communication.

In the kernel, there's nothing to it.

I see no need for group communication in the kernel.

We haven't done any measurements.

When a lock is requested on the master node, there's no communication, no
messages, it's all local processing.  No one else in the cluster even
knows about the lock.

OK, we'll try to do some measurements at some point.
