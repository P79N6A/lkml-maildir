Why are non root users allowed write access in the first place?  Can't 
the pollute the entropy pool and thus actually REDUCE the amount of good 
entropy?  It seems to me that only root should have write access in the 
first place because of this, and thus, anything root writes should 
increase the entropy count since one can assume that root is supplying 
good random data for the purpose of increasing the entropy count.
I was planning on just setting up a little root cron script to pull some 
random data from another machine on the network to add to the local 
pool, then push some random data back to the other machine to increase 
its pool, but found that this doesn't work due to this restriction.
