I wonder why jiffies are not unsigned long...the 64-bit case would have been 
handled quite nicely too... :-)

I wish I had the resources to get one... :-(
The thing is that x86 is here to stay for quite some time. Even if 64-bit 
processors take over the market, you will have so many "old" computers that 
can:
- - be thrown out
- - donated to some institution
- - converted to routers, and other "embedded" systems
Plus, they will be dirt cheap.

Intel screwed up with Itanium, if it had "legacy" support, they would have 
been better off...
