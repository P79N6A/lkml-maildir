Hallo lkml,
I have problem with kernel 2.6.3-mm1: apache cannot start. Some last
lines from strace output:
3299  shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 737284, IPC_CREAT|0600) = 393216
3299  shmat(393216, 0, 0)               = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
3299  time(NULL)                        = 1077193406
3299  write(15, "[Thu Feb 19 13:23:26 2004] [emer"..., 69) = 69
3299  shmctl(393216, IPC_64|IPC_RMID, 0) = 0
3299  munmap(0x40018000, 4096)          = 0
3299  exit_group(2)                     = ?
I think, that problem is in the calling shmat function?
My last kernel was 2.6.2-mm1 and here apache went without problems...
Sincerely
Jan Marek
