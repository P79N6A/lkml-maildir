If you really think this is important thing to do, I suggest you
create a kernel patch which returns a partial read/write whenever the
the size is even (and return an odd number of bytes), thus
guaranteeing that 50% of the time, any I/O appears to have been
interrupted.
Then run it on a system, and see what breaks.  I wouldn't suggest
doing this on any system that you care about, though!
