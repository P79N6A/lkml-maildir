Problems, including file system corruption, have been reported with 2.3
kernels.  I haven't seen any corruption, but I did see a lockup today.
I had created and wrote a new RedHat 6.1 cd.  After burning the cd I
mounted the iso image on loopback and mounted the new cd on the ide-scsi
interface.  I then did a diff between the two to check the burn.  After
a lengthy period of time, towards what would have been the end of the
process, the system locked up.  Sysctl t showed the diff process was
stuck in D state.  I can make a more formal report if needed, but I
understood the problem was already being looked at.
