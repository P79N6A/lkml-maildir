if nothing else preferential use of 'local' (non PAE) memory over 'remote' 
(PAE) memory for programs, while still useing it all as needed.
this may be done already, but this type of difference between the access 
speed of different chunks of ram seems to be exactly the type of thing 
that the NUMA code solves the general case for. I'm thinking that it may 
end up simplifying things if the same general-purpose logic will work for 
the specific case of PAE instead of it being hard coded as a special case.
it also just struck me as the most obvious example of where a UP box could 
have a NUMA-like memory arrangement (and therefor a case to justify 
decoupling the SMP and NUMA options)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
