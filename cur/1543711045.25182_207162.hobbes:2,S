Hi All,
just want to know, if there is a patch, that gets my ALIM1543C A1 to work.
I used Kernel 2.4.24 with no success... Is there anything fixed in 2.6.xx?
Already wrote to the gentoo-mailinglist and they told me to ask you guys.
See below
cheers 
Nicolas

Betreff: Boot problem...
Hi All,
I´m trying to install gentoo for the first time and I´ve some problems getting it working. I followed the documentation on www.gentoo.org but with no luck. Here is my problem:
I did installation with genkernel, because manual configuration of the kernel failed several times. So when gentoo boots, these errors are displayed:
Step 4: Determining root device
Root blockdevice unspecified or not detected
~~~~~snipp~~~~~
hda: attached ide-disk driver
hda: task_no_data_intr: status=0x51 {DriveReady SeekComplete Error}
hda: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 {DriveStatus Error}

What´s that? Is it because I got ReiserFS as fs on all partitions???
I activated ResierFS support in Kernel.
Here´s my grub.conf:
default 0
timeout 30
title=gentoo
root (hd0,0)
kernel /kernel-2.4.24 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc real_root=/dev/hda3
initrd /initrd-2.4.24
After I tried several HDDs, I did a dmesg with LiveCD and there is the same problem: see dump attached
