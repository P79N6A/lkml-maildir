A little question: I used to believe that crypto software requires
strong random source to generate key pairs, but this requirement in
not true for session keys.  You don't usually generate a key pair on
a remote system, of course, so that's not a big issue. On low-entropy
systems (headless servers) is /dev/urandom strong enough to generate
session keys? I guess the little entropy collected by the system is
enough to feed the crypto secure PRNG for /dev/urandom, is it correct?
