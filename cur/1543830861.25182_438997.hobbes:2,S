Hello
This mail will be followed by two patches against 2.6.17-mm3.
First introduces batch_write method to address space operation which is
to allow filesystems to write more than one page in one call, changes
generic_file_buffered_write to use filesystem's batch_write if it is
available and implements generic_batch_write which writes one page in a
call.
Second patch changes reiser4 to use generic_file_write and reiser4
specific batch_write.
These patches were only tested on one test system so far, and
reiserfs-list failed to elicit any volunteers.  I guess that means it
should go into -mm.:-/
Any feedback on these patches is welcomed.
