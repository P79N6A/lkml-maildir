ksymoops is just warning you that it processed the log using default
values for the input files.  With all the different distributions out
there plus each user's own tweaks plus the assumption that the machine
has not been rebooted since the oops, a warning is in order.  Basically
it says "are you sure that the default input files are valid for this
oops, on this machine, right now?".
You can suppress that warning by supplying any of -v, -V, -k, -K, -l,
-L, -m, -M.  Any of those options tells ksymoops "I know what I am
doing".
