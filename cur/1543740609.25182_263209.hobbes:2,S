do you get the same pauses if you do 'dmesg -n 1'? Also, are you using
preempt_thresh or the maximum-searching variant? preempt_thresh can
generate _tons_ of messages with a low threshold, freezing the system in
essence for long periods of time.
but this trace is weird:

this doesnt seem like normal behavior. It seems two tasks are
ping-pong-ing a semaphore but are unable to make any progress. The whole
thing is non-preemptible because this semaphore was taken while in a 
PREEMPT_ACTIVE section.
(i'd say this is the BKL semaphore - it is quite special in that
regard.)
