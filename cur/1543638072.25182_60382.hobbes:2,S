I should have asked more specifically. But I am trying to compile
user-mode-linux on Ultrasparc(running Debian). egcs64 compiles just
kernelspace code. I want to know what compiler can be used to build
user-mode-linux(which contains some userspace and some kernelspace code)
64-bit on Ultrasparc? gcc-3.0 seems to give problems with linker. I am
not sure if any other version of gcc is capable of doing that.
Thanks in advance
