   The local APIC timer is specified in the Intel Manual volume 3 for example.
   It's an optional feature (CPUID), but pretty much everyone has it.
It is internal or external to the processor?  Ie. can it be in the
southbridge or something?  If yes, then I still hold my point.
You shouldn't have to PIO to get a reliable timer value.
