It would be even better to mention it in the kernel documentation,
since iproute2 is fairly standard now.  I'm really not enough of a
kernel hacker to change it, but the current Configure.help entry for
CONFIG_NETLINK suggests that it is useful only for relatively
obscure applications.
    You need to say Y here to use the tools in the iproute2 package
    (<
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru
>).
And is CONFIG_RTNETLINK also necessary for ip?
