  Hi, all. I'm asking for people with AMD CPUs to please try my latest
MSR patch. I've laid the foundation for AMD support in the MTRR driver
(in preparation for merging a patch from Alan Cox), and I'd like to
get some testing done before I proceed.
So if you have an AMD CPU, please apply the patch and send me the
contents of /proc/cpuinfo with and without the patch. Note that the
patch doesn't add MTRR support yet: it just does some groundwork.
The patch is available at:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
and is against 2.2.2+devfs. If you have a non-devfs kernel, that's OK
too, you'll just get a few failed hunks in the credits and
ChangeLog. It doesn't actually break any code. So applyling the patch
against plain 2.2.2 will be fine.
BTW: make sure you set CONFIG_MTRR=y.
Also make sure you set CONFIG_MSR=n and CONFIG_PERFMON=n if you
patched against 2.2.2 only (i.e. no devfs).
				Regards,
					Richard....
