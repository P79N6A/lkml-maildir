Subject: [PATCH] machine_kexec.c: Fix the description of segment handling.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/15/1

One of my original comments in machine_kexec was unclear
and this should fix it.

Be very careful with this patch.  It seems to be surrounded
by a somebody else's problem field.
I wrote it months ago, and then forgot it.  I started writing this
email message several days ago and then forgot it.
Hopefully including this patch won't cause this effect to spread
and cause the entire kernel to be universally treated as somebody
else's problem. :)
