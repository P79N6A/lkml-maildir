If we can preserve compatibility, moving the private headers to a
separate place makes sense.  However, preserving compatibility is not
a good thing, because a lot of the brokenness is in how things are
exported.  Thus, you want libc to be able to have a linux/* wrapper
for backwards compatibility.
My first choice would be to put the ABI headers in linux/abi.

True; I hadn't considered the weirdness of the namespace pollution
issue.  However, the issue with struct tags remain.
Note also that not all ABI issues can be well-described in C headers,
and certainly not the way it currently is.  Syscall numbers and ioctl
APIs are examples there (I do some hideously ugly hacks in klibc to
try to auto-derive as much of the ABI as possible; this is part of
making klibc very easy to port to new architectures and keeps
maintenance in one place.)  However, cleaning up the headers is a
major step forward.
