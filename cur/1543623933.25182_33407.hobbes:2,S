Hi there,
I'm trying to use the raid function of my motherboard (abit vp6) which has a HPT370 controller.
I compiled the kernel with HPTP370 support & also the support for HPT370 raid.
Everything seems to be working correctly, but i don't have the /dev/ataraid devices. 
My kernel does shows it detected the harddisks correctly:
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xc000-0xc007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xc008-0xc00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
HPT370: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 70

Partition check:

 hde: unknown partition table
 hdg: unknown partition table

 ataraid/d0: unknown partition table
Highpoint HPT370 Softwareraid driver for linux version 0.01
Drive 0 is 29311 Mb 
Drive 1 is 29311 Mb 
Raid array consists of 2 drives. 
-------------
Did i forget anything? Do i have to create the /dev/ataraid devices myself?
Thanks,
Jeroen
