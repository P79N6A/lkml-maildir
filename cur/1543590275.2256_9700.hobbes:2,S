OK, I ran.

I hope not. I know at least my RAM is OK. I installed 256Mb
before booting with 2.4.4 and tested all with memtest86.
CVS couldn't remove mozilla/xpinstall/wizard/windows/nszip
after the process terminated, but
mozilla/xpinstall/wizard/windows/nszip/Entries and
mozilla/xpinstall/wizard/windows/nszip/Tag were updated after
the first EXT2-fs error messages.
Well, everything seems OK for now. Thanks.
