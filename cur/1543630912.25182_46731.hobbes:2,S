Thats why I tried to identify areas that could be merged even before
kbuild-2.5 got merged.
o "make dep" changes in for example split-include
o install target in config.in for i386
o asm-offset functionality for i386
o kwhich
I see no way to split the core part in smaller parts. It does not make sense
to merge only half of this for example.
The rest of the patch is a huge amount of makefile.in files, and some other
related files.
The patch as such could be splitted in several different ways, but again
it would not make sense to merge that gradually over time.

I do not mix up the purpose of the two systems, but suggesting the
drivers.conf concept makes both systems rely on information in the same file.
Therefore I suggested a two step approach:
1) Let kbuild understand and accept the drivers.conf concept gradually
2) Let the configuration system accept the Drivers.conf concept gradually
With gradually I expect it to be on a directory basis.

What exists now is two parrallel systems. This has the negative effect that 
it fails to show how much old cruft can be removed from the kernel upon 
acceptance of kbuild-2.5. As it is now kbuild-2.5 either modify some
existing files or add some new files.
It would be nice to see how much could be cleaned up from the kernel
upon acceptance of kbuild-2.5.
The makefiles that can be removed alone counts ~2700 lines.
