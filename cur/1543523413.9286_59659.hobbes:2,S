	If you wanted completely separate memory spaces for each processor, the
current hardware will let you have it. Just separate the address space into
logical chunks and code each processor only to use its chunk. The current
hardware design lets you do exactly what you are suggesting. And if one
processor does need to acceess the memory earmarked for another, the current
hardware provides a fast way to do it.
