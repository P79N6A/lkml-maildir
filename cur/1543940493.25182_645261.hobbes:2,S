Maybe I'm all wet, but I think iSER vs. SRP should be roughly
comparable.  The exact formatting of various messages etc. is
different but the data path using RDMA is pretty much identical.  So
the big difference between STGT iSER and SCST SRP hints at some big
difference in the efficiency of the two implementations.
