Right now, I'm accepting one-liners that I think are "obvious" and also
"very important" (ie fixes for oopses that anybody can trigger, rather
than for example updates to one particular driver). So it sounds like I

If this is basically an obvious one-liner ("move a kfree")?
Andrew is still off, and he can make a decision independently, but right
