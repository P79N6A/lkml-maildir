The problem (for my tiny brain at least) is that I don't know where
idr_pre_get() can put the memory it allocates if there's no lock in
the idr structure -- how do you maintain internal consistency if no
locks are held when filling the cache?
Having the caller hold a chunk of memory in a stack variable was the
trick I came up with to get around that.
