Hello! I'm a newbuy in kernel development.
Now I'm just trying to find out what is going in it =).
I noticed this:
>>(BTW. There is a new category called "Will be fixed in 2.6.23")
Is it really important to release 2.6.22 as soon as possible? I think
kernel should be 99% stable. Why not to wait for patches on known
regressions and release more or less stable 2.6.22?
Thanks!
Best wishes, Niam.
