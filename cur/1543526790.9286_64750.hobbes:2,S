 When I ran one of those, it was DHCP-only (meaning: you do NOT enter
that ifconfig command).  What happens if you set your card to DHCP mode,
then run 'pump' manually.  Do you get a lease?
 I know that one version of pump from Redhat (with 6.0) had a bug in it
such that it would'nt work with a surfboard, hopefully that bug isn't
back.
