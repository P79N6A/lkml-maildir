gcc on x86 definitely wants a -fdontyoudareusefloatingpoint... The
following snippet from the -msoft-float docs isn't encouraging:
     On machines where a function returns floating point results in the
     80387 register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted
     even if `-msoft-float' is used.
[yes, I realize it's an ABI constraint in this case, but IMO it's also
indicative in general of the difficulty in getting gcc to _never_
generate fp opcodes on x86, now or in the future]
Anyway, if you wanna play it safe WRT gcc future, the following
patch works.
-mno-3dnow is probably over-paranoia, because (IIRC) it doesn't contain
any integer instructions, but maybe I'm wrong.  It can't hurt... :)
