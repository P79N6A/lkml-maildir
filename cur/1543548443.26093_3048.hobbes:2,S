Why? What's wrong with the current implementation. And more important
still: How well-known is Yarrow160A? I cannot find it in my copy of
[Schneier96], so it is probably not older than four years.

_Please_ use the crypto api. It provides for a cipher and a digest(hash)
api. sha1 is implemented and functional (AFAICS), but 3des will have to
be converted to use the new api. That is not hard. If it does not fit
your needs, try convincing astor to make changes. It's really time that
the crypto api gets used by more than loopvack crypto, esp. now that it
is distributed on ftp.*.kernel.org.

Do you mean /rev/random or /dev/urandom?
