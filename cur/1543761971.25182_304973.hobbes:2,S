Well, all I can tell is someone suggested changing to a Synaptic Xinput 
driver in at the 2.6.10 -> 2.6.11 transition, cause the synaptic drivers 
has a lot of new functionality.
2.6.10 was OK with kernel driver, no changes to X made.
2.6.11 without the Xinput driver was a PITA. With the new driver, it was 
still worse than 2.6.10, but better than plain 2.6.11. One thing better: 
the support for scrolling.
2.6.12-rc1 is almost OK with Xinput driver, can't say a thing about 
plain 2.6.12-rc1.
As for dragging, it was ok in 2.6.10 and previous, but currently broken.
