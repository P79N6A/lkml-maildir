I begging use net with Ethernet instead usbnet and reduce a little the
problems (I can have nvidia DRI working without problems or oops) but
still appear the same lost tickets.

I had update bugzilla with dmesg from 2.6.19-RC4-mm2, which already came
with the latest release of hrtimers, because for the first time I could
boot without hang on boot, with hrtimers and without notsc boot option.
But it have a long long oops that maybe could give you some clues.
