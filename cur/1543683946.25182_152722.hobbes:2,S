Hi Marcelo!
just verified that the NFS root bug-fix was not
included in 2.4.22-pre9, unfortunately I have 
to ask you again, why you do not want to fix 
this issue in 2.4.22 ...
I do not understand why Trond obviously is
ignoring my mails, regarding this particular
issue, maybe he is just too busy to look at 
four twoline changes, and more, I do not 
understand why this isn't accepted into the 
marcelo kernel tree, as it obviously fixes a
misbehaviour?
please explain!
It is okay for me, if your argumentation goes 
like "I don't like you, that's reason enough
for me to not include your patches ...", but I
would like to know ...
best,
Herbert
