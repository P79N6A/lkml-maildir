Hello!

Yes. It is not so direct task. BHs are globally serialized on SMP
(i.e. only one BH can run at any moment); tasklets are not.
F.e. driver, using BHs, was allowed not to be bothered that
a timer can run simultaneously with its BH. So, drivers require auditing.

No.

Yes. It can be called from any context.
