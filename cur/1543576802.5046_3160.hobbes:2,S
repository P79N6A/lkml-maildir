Oh, I'm sure it is unrelated -- it's just a good trigger for the
problem on my laptop.
    Reiserfs might be the trigger because the quota code changed, but
    if it did touch it I'd expect it to have failed to compile
No quotas, local version of reiserfs but probably not too divergent
from what else is out there.
    I'm going to go and do a detailed audit of the mm bits I have
    differing from Linus. For one I'd be much happier to differ in
    drivers with Linus and avoid differing in mm/vm internals stuff.
I'll resync to t13p5 and any new reiserfs change that might be
relevant and see how that goes; if that works I'll start merging in
ac2 and see when it breaks.
