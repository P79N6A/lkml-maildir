But overloading struct page values happens in other places too. Putting
everything into struct page is not scalable. We could also make kmalloc
return not a void pointer put a pointer to a union of every possible
structure that kmalloc may ever be used for, just in case we have to
inspect some data structure that could have been overwritten by something
else ;)
But seriously... you can always cast a page to a slub_page to see if it is
unexpectedly a slub page.
