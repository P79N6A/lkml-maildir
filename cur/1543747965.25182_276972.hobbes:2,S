Hi List!
I am working on a video-4-linux driver for IEEE-1394 cameras. The driver 
exposes a struct ieee1394_device_id table to match devices on a certain 
specifier.
If I specify a match for a specifier_id of 0xa02d and a version of 
0x100, the "probe" callback supplied via "hpsb_register_protocol" is 
never called, even if such a device is connected.
The driver is loaded by "hotplug" though so obviously the match is correct.
Now if I change the supplied specifier_id to match some other device and 
leave the rest of the code just alike, the "probe" callback _is_ called.
The only difference between the two situations I can spot is that for 
the specifier_id of "0xa02d", there are already two modules registered: 
raw1394 and video1394. For the specifier_id of the other device, there 
is no other registered driver.
Am I missing something obvious? Or is it really not possible to register 
a driver for a device that has a match on some other driver? Or is it 
just a bug in the ieee1394 node manager?
Thanks,
 /Arne
