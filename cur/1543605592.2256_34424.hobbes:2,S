At present fbdev is just a dumb framebuffer. In time I plan to merge both
DRI and fbdev into one common interface. Their is alot of ideas on where
graphics handling should be done. IMO the kernel should only manage the
state of the hardware amoung the various processes. This is defintely
needed for SMP machines where two processes could be using the hardware 
at the same time. Not actually programming the video hardware. That is
userland job.
