Dear all
after reading some posts and previously trying to get a PIIX chip to 
work I have come to the following conclusion
IDE is not nice
here is my suggestion:
Leave the old drivers (or 2.4 forward port) alone and fix any bugs 
slowly massaging it to what you want
IDE-TNG should ONLY deal with Serial ATA and ONLY chipset support not 
PCI based implementations and should be a config option (keep it simple 
as possible).
this way we have a clean start with a spec and not huge amounts of 
combinations to test in the real world (so we can report those bugs 
that  a US company wont talk about for fear of litigation)
AND
we have drivers that are known to work in the real world (the 2.4 
forward port)
what do you think ?
regards
John Jones
