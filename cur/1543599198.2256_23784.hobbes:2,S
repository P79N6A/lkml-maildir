2.4.9 is somewhat stable for me, here's where it bit me:
- init occasionally hangs on boot
- bridge (with netfilter patches from bridge.sf.net) kills NFS (I have
  been told bridge and fragmented traffic don't go together well and I'd
  have to change rsize/wsize to prevent fragmentation)
Is 2.4.8-ac12 "testable" or rather "stable"?
