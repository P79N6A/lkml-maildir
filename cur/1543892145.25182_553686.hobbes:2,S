Do I smell a bug when a task switches its scheduling classes?
Lets say a task was in real-time class for a long time and switches to
fair-sched class. When update_curr() is called on this new fair-sched
task, some of required fields (for ex: exec_start) are uninitialized and can 
lead to bogus calculations?
Also, real-time tasks are currently influencing fair clock calculations
(because there is only one raw_weighted_load field per runqueue). Is
that intentional?
