Note that there's a fixed voltage regulator driver in the tree for
handling those.

That is doable but error prone, especially if doing something like
adding regulator support to an existing driver or when new parts come
out.  Often the part numbers are only slight different (adding an
additional letter at the end of the day) which doesn't help.
