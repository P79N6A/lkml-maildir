We can do better as we do currently, but we cannever get the kernel 100% 
warning free for all supported kernel configurations and all supported 
gcc versions.
E.g. gcc emitting some "unused variable" warnings when compiling with 
CONFIG_PCI=n is quite common, and although they could all be fixed there 
will always be some warnings with unusual kernel configurations.
