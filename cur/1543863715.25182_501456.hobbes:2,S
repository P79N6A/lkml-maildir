So after a writeout it will be coherent of course, so the point in
question is what happens when someone comes in and dirties it at the
worst possible moment? That relates to the paragraph below...

... so surely if you do a direct read followed by a buffered read,
you should *not* get the same data if there has been some activity
to modify that part of the file in the meantime (whether that be a
buffered or direct write).

Ah, I'm glad to see somebody cares about doing the right thing ;)
Maybe I'll use XFS for my filesystems in future.
