No, I'll say to leave these "0 +" in the code.  It doesn't hurt anything
(the compiler takes care of it in preprocessing) and it instantly tells
you exactly what the code is really doing (disabling endpoint 0).
Without the 0 in there, you would have to take a bit to think about
which endpoint is actually being disabled.
So, sorry, I'm not going to apply this.
Oh, and next time, please CC: the linux usb maintainer, and the
linux-usb-devel mailing list when you post USB patches.
thanks,
