Not sure.

Yes, I agree.  It may race, but with what?

The memory clobber only acts as a compiler barrier and insures the
compiler does not reorder the statements from the order in the C code.
What we need is a memory barrier to ensure the processor does not
reorder statements.  In other words, the processor can completely
rearrange loads and stores as they are issued to it, as long as it does
not break obvious data dependencies.  On a weakly ordered processor,
sans memory barrier, there is no telling when and where a store will
actually reach memory.  This is regardless of the order of the C code or
anything else.
That said, I do not know if the above example is a problem or not.  On a
very quick glance, the only issue I saw is the one I pointed out
earlier, and you fixed it.
