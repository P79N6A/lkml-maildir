In Kconfig all of the radio cards depend on VIDEO_V4L1. But V4L1 has
been deprecated and replaced with V4L2. V4L2 offers a V4L1
compatibility layer. Should the Kconfig for these devices be changed
to depend on (VIDEO_V4L1. | VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT)? I just made this
change locally and they all built ok.
