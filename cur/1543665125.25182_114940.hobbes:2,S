Subject: Zombie processes with mozilla loading java applets 2.5.60-2.5.64

Since about 2.5.60, I've noticed when loading java applets in Mozilla, sometimes they fail to load and create a zombie process. Killing Mozilla and restarting the java applets usually fixes the problem, but this is easily reproducible. This does not occur in 2.4.20. Java version is 'Sun JDK 1.4.1', compiled locally against 'GCC 3.2.2'. I haven't found anything in the archives about this. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Regards,
David Shepard
