Understood. But by definition, there must be at least one page of data on the 
filesystem whose location we know in order to do the resume. Why can't we 
simply use one extra page to store this data?
At least in my reading of suspend/main.c we create a directory of pages which 
itself is stored on disk. Since we do that, can't we simply use an extra page 
for this signature?
