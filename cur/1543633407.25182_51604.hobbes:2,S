When doing sendfile with my acenic card on my 8xPIII-700 and PAE 
running 2.4.18, I'm getting all zeros in the files being transmitted. 
  Running the Redhat 2.4.18-4 kernel fixes the problem.  I saw this 
entry in the rpm's changelog:
* Sat Aug 25 2001 Ingo Molnar <mingo@redhat.com>
- fix the acenic driver bug that caused random kernel memory being
    sent out on the wire, on x86 systems with more than 4 GB RAM.
I tried to pull the relevant bits out of
linux-2.4.17-selected-ac-bits.patch and linux-2.4.18-tg3.patch, with
no success.  I mailed Ingo with no response.
Does anybody remember what the fix was, or still have the patch handy?
