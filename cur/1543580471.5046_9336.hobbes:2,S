If someone says 1 bus, give them one bus.
Just make the description say:
  Add 1 for every PCI
  Add 1 for every AGP
  Add 1 for every CardBus
  Also account for anything else funny in the system.
Then panic on boot if they're wrong (sort of like processor type).
It's somewhat annoying that by choosing SMP NR_CPUS goes to 32 when I know
I only have (and ever will have) 2 in this machine.  Don't make busses have
the same assumptions that just waste memory.
