Gidday. I just compiled 2.3.22 on an i386 (P100), and it chokes on every
single SysV init script with the daemon command in it. It either gives
me over a screen of <1>Operation not supported, then turns to a nice
colourful display of arrows, then instantly reboots, or gives me an
extensive error report with lots of numbers (stack dump or OOPS?), and
reboots or says "Killing offending process" (something like that), and
then goes into a panic because it tried to kill the idle process. I have
none of this in logs, because it either freezes or reboots, and then I
have to boot into my stable (relatively) 2.3.21 kernel, which replaces
dmesg.
Any ideas ?
Thanks in advance =)
