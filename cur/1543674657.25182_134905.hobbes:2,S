Hello Justin,
to make that clear: I am in no way sure _what_ is causing the problem. I am
only updating the (very few) infos I gave/could give during the last weeks.
From looking at the ongoings I would say your driver patch (URL already sent
several times) made things better. This does obviously not mean that the
kernel-included aic-driver is the sole cause of the troubles.
I am in fact very pleased that rc2/aic-20030502 made things quite noticably
better than every 21-rc/pre before.
What I am giving is a positive feedback, but I have as few logs for it as I had
for the very negative I sent times ago.
Anyway, I am continuing with stress-tests on rc3/aic-20030520. 
Regards,
Stephan
