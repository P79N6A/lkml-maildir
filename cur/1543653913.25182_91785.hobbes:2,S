IMHO, the thing that the early Unix systems did wrong was to not have 
u8, u16, u32, etc as basic ctypes in sys/types.h.  And C should have 
had a way to fake it if they weren't native.
Anyone who has ported a networking stack or worked on driver knows exactly
what I'm talking about.
And while I'm whining, 
	assert(strlen(any typedef) < 8));
I like my stack variable declarations to line up.  I despise some_long_name_t
typedefs with a passion.
