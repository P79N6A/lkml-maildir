hm, why is CFS in mainline a problem? The CFS merge should make the life 
of development/test patches like plugsched conceptually easier. (it will 
certainly cause a lot of churn, but that's for the better i think.)
Most of the schedulers in plugsched should be readily adaptable to the 
modular scheduling-policy scheme of the upstream scheduler. I'm sure 
there will be some minor issues as isolation of the modules is not 
enforced right now - and i'd be happy to review (and potentially apply) 
common-sense patches that improve the framework.
