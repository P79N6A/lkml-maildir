NAK.
It's a well-known and documented fact that we not have a stable API for 
modules.
And as long as we anyway break the modules API in so many other cases 
with each kernel release there's simply no point in not removing exports 
immediately.
Oh, and for increasing the amount of nonsense even further, you should 
explain why unused exports that just sneaked into 2.6.25-rc1 must be 
shipped in 4 stable kernels before they can be removed.
