Hmmmm, as I understand the source, it let the routing register entries 
unchanged if the BIOS did it before. This is why it (IMHO) works. But if this 
routine tries to set a new route it fails due to it writes the wrong register 
nibble. But maybe I'm wrong, I will read the source again (and try to get a 
CS5520 datasheet).

ACK. :-)
