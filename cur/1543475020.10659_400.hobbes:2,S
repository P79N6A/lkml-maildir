Subject: Bug, bug fix, and patch to sys_select(); where do I send this?

Hi,
When select() is fed a negative timeout value, it accepts it and passes it 
on to the scheduler, with printk()'s a warning message; however, the syscall 
returns to the calling program with no error.
I think either (a) it shouldn't log the warning message, or (b) it should
return an error to the caller.  The online Unix98 spec is ambiguous.  
Consensus, and other operating systems, favor (b).  The rather trivial patch 
(relative to 2.2.0-pre4) and the end of this message implements this change.
I have a meta-question: where do I send this sort of trivial thing?  It 
matters to me because some broken program on my machine was causing these 
messages; I posted about the problem with very little reply; but I feel 
silly sending something this trivial to Linus (and even if I wanted to, 
I'm not sure how what e-mail address to use; the MAINTAINERS file doesn't 
list one).
