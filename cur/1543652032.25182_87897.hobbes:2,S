Huh?  This has nothing to do with security through obscurity.
This has to do with the Unix permissions model.  /proc/pid probably
shouldn't leak information that would otherwise be kept confidential in the
standard Unix permissions model (principle of least surprise, etc.).

They why is it allowed?  Allowing something that noone needs and
that breaks most people's intuitions of how security will work seems
like a pretty questionable idea.
