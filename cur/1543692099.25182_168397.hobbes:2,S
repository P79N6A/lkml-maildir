Subject: [BK PATCH] More i2c driver fixes for 2.6.0-test5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Here are some more i2c driver fixes and additions for 2.6.0-test5.  I've
fixed up the check_region/request_region logic for isa drivers and moved
the i2c algorithms into their own subdirectory, both as recommended by
Christoph, and added the eeprom i2c chip driver (ported from the 2.4
tree and converted to use the sysfs binary file interface).
There are a also a few other minor i2c cleanups and fixes in here.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h

  o I2C: remove unneeded #defines in the eeprom chip driver
  o I2C: add eeprom i2c chip driver
  o I2C: move the i2c algorithm drivers to drivers/i2c/algos
  o I2C: remove the isa address check alltogether
