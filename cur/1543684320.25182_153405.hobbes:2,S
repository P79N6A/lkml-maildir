In this way, I can access all the data of the via686a sensors from the
sysfs without problems (yes, I need a compatible userland, but this
isn't a problem... i can wrote some myself).
I haven't found information about this problem in the post halloween or
in other 2.5 documents, I think is an important thing to know, via686a
chipsets are quite used, AFAIK.
