Strictly speaking from memory consumption point of view, it probably comes
for free since sizeof(struct request_queue) currently is 456 bytes on x86
and 816 on 64bit arch.  The structure is being rounded to 512 or 1024 with
kmalloc.  If it is on the borderline to next kmalloc size, it probably should
be revisited.  But so far it has been noise on the positive side.
