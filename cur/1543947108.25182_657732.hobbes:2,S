The kernel gets a flat memory map; all memory is just plain RAM.  The 
problem is that we're allocating a normal page and turning it into a 
pagetable - so far so good.  Then the DMI code is randomly mapping that 
same page RW so it can scan it for DMI signatures, which Xen is preventing.
There are two immediate fixes:
   1. Only scan for DMI if the memory is reserved (rejected, because HPA
      says some machines don't reserve the DMI space).  Alternatively,
      don't bother scanning if booting under Xen.
   2. Make DMI map the memory RO so that Xen doesn't complain (which is
      sensible because DMI is ROM anyway).
But as far as I can tell, this shouldn't be happening anyway, and could 
happen on real hardware which doesn't reserve the DMI space.  It 
probably doesn't because initial pagetables on real hardware use large 
pages, and therefore allocate less memory for pagetable memory and 
therefore doesn't end up hitting the 0xf0000 region.  But that area 
should be excluded from the allocation pool.
