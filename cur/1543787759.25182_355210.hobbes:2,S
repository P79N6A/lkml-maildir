I have a compile error in drivers/net/hamradio/mkiss.c
	CC [M]  drivers/net/hamradio/mkiss.o
	drivers/net/hamradio/mkiss.c:625: error: 
	RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED’ undeclared here (not in a function)
Due to the fact that
	RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED 
has not been converted to the form
	RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED(name.lock)
by the RT patch.
But I don't actually need this module anyway. :-)
regards,
Felix
