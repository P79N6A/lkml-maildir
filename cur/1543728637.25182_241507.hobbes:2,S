I don't like this approach using a dynamic counter. I think it would
be better to add a new function that takes the vma and uses the offset
into the inode for static interleaving (anonymous memory would still
use the vma offset). This way you would have a good guarantee that the
interleaving stays interleaved even when the system swaps pages in and
out and you're less likely to get anomalies in the page distribution.
