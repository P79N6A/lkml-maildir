Any video BIOS (especially EGA) may call system BIOS functions, e.g. via the
old INT10 (which will get copied to INT42).
HGC and VGA are in the system BIOS. They don't need magic, but they need to
be initialized on order to keep the monitor from burning. On the other hand,
they used to be initialised correctly.
