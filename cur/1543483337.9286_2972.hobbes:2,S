You caught me! I recount my initial statement, your code is superb, perfect,
the idiology of all good and true.  My '1 in 4' lectural stupidity was
brought on by my misunderstanding the state of the irq while in and
returning from plip_send_packet(), and also not looking at how a failed
return with a disabled irq would affect future operation of that routine.
 Let me explain my misunderstanding.
You enter plip_send_packet from plip_bh, plip_bh then passes the return
value on to plip_bh_timeout_error for processing.  plip_bh_timeout_error
then goes on to decide how to handle the error based on the return value and
responses from the port.
Ok, I bet that was fun putting together.  Now if plip_send_packet disables
the irq, and it does, and then exits with a return value of TIMEOUT before
enabling irq we face the same problem as before your patch.
Here's what I _thought_ I saw: (*my comments*)
/* PLIP_SEND_PACKET --- send a packet */

count?). Maybe just me, but now when we return from this routine to plip_bh

wind up with this logic: (*my comments*)

}
Unfortunately my machines don't agree with me. As much as I really really
want this event to not happen, it must be, because I can't find any other
explanation for the dead interface and endless transmit timeout messages
that plague my machine with the current plip.c minus my patch.
To explain my '1 in 4(or 5) chance' the chances would be that at any given
point the state of irq could become unknown or 'out of sync' with the
general operation of the driver.
Something else I found while staring at the code last night was:
plip_bh() passes ERROR as an error value to plip_bh_timeout_error(), in that
function you will find this code:
                if (error != ERROR) { /* Timeout */
                        nl->timeout_count++;
                        if ((error == HS_TIMEOUT
                             && nl->timeout_count <= 10)
                            || nl->timeout_count <= 3) {
                                spin_unlock_irq(&nl->lock);
                                /* Try again later */
                                return TIMEOUT;
                        }
                        c0 = inb(PAR_STATUS(dev));
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: transmit
timeout(%d,%02x)\n",
                               dev->name, snd->state, c0);
                } else
                        error = HS_TIMEOUT;
which effectively turns your ERROR into HS_TIMEOUT, which in turn makes a
call to disable_irq()
plip_receive_packet() (called from plip_bh)
        switch (rcv->state) {
        case PLIP_PK_TRIGGER:
                DISABLE(dev->irq);
(...snip)
                                printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: checksum error\n",
dev->name);
                        return ERROR;
                }
                rcv->state = PLIP_PK_DONE;
This is unlikely to happen, and my problem lies within the sending operation
(or so I think).  But this would produce the same result. I hadn't noticed
this before, so..  I'll just fall back on the fact I'm not a kernel guru and
I miss a lot of detail while trying to realize the concepts before me.
That's it.  I just created macros that would prevent this event from
happening in all cases.  And you want to hear some bold ass truth? It makes
little difference.  My solution? I leave the irq alone by making the macros
Functional-NOPs (; statements).  You want to know why?  I don't see any
reason to disable the irq.  afaik the PLIP protocol itself relies on each
end negotiating using PAR_CONTROL_INTER (parport.h) being written it's
control line.  In the event the two ends de-sync the connection attempts to
resume by sending an ack and continuing (or so I like to believe, hence,
the secondary-purpose behind the protocol). If this is the case then
disabling irq yields little or no benefit.
I've been using this 'technique' for a few days now and have had no
problems, I would like to have someone else's opinion on this though.  What
advantage would be gained?  What problem should it be causing that I'm not
seeing? if you want me to point out how this driver recovers when de-sync "i
don't know, grep for 'collision'."
As a final note on not managing the irq, my xfer is about equal to
40kbyte/s, the same as under 2.1.1xx
I look forward to responses, I'm a kernel hacker wanna-be and any
information sent my way is appreciated, even if you do get verbal, at least
I'll know. I'm still struggling (between my job and other responsibilities)
to understand much of how the kernel works.  So most of what I'd thought is
wrong is based on assumption.  Things you could help me understand so I can
shut my trap next time I think something works:
The state of the irq when bh_plip() is called?  I assumed irq is enabled.
What happens if you disable irq from within a bh function? I assumed the
state is left unchanged, so if you disable irq it remains disabled until re
enabled.  And will it be re-enabled before the next call to a bh function? I
assumed no since it didn't appear to be working that way.
Your code was perfect. It just doesn't seem to work on my machine even
though it's been working since last August when I found out about the PLIP
driver in Linux. So, I threw it out and began working from an older plip.c
that worked not but six days ago.  I'd *LOVE* to discuss this problem with
someone (anyone) who knows something (anything) about the kernel, bh
function handling internals and irq state surrounding this driver.
  
Otherwise I'm just stabbing into darkness.
I tried to avoid HS_TIMEOUT in hopes there was a better solution, possibly
one that Works For Me As Well As You(tm) (can we trademark that?).  I'm only
basing this off the fact that it worked before, there was no HS_TIMEOUT
before and that irq code was changed since then.
                synchronize_irq();
        }
Just for the record, if irq needs a sync, it's handled within enable_irq(),
i tried to point that out months ago but the only change made was the one
line I made mention of it on.  I could care less, though, I'm capable.
Okay, now what did you want?  Oh, of course, if you would like me to explain
what you can read in the diff I sent you I can, but it's not terribly
complicated. I had moved sections of code to more appropriate locations
(such as #defines where you'd expect to find them, structs, functions et
cetera), that might throw you off a bit.
