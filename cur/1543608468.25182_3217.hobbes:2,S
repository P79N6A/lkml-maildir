Skip,
 I've just got around to testing this. I didn't have problems with the
current version of ide-floppy, but I thought I'd give it a go anyway. I'm
sorry to say that the performance as standard is atrocious. I was
previously using 2.4.12-ac3 with the preempt patch, for these tests I
tried 2.4.13-ac6. (All tests at the console, no other conscious use of the
box.)
hdparm -Tt /dev/hdd1  cache              disk
2.4.12-ac3-preempt    52.67Mb/s          1.06Mb/s
2.4.13-ac6+your patch 52.89Mb/S        480.43kB/s
(above are worst of three, but there isn't wide variation)
time mke2fs /dev/hdd1   real    user     sys
2.4.12-ac3-preempt    0m4.252s 0m0.010s 0m0.090s
2.4.13-ac6+your patch 0m8.349s 0m0.000s 0m0.070s

This is on a K6/500, and with your patch the disk feels _so_ slow. I
accept it can be tweaked through the /proc interface, but if this is the
default behaviour, it's dreadful. I do wonder if you've got a flakey 
drive ? Sorry.

         If a six turned out to be nine, I don't mind.
