They already pretty much are.
I do want to re-write block_read/write to use the page cache, but not
because it would impact anything in this discussion. I want to do it early
in 2.5.x, because:
 - it will speed up accesses
 - it will re-use existing code better and conceptualize things more
   cleanly (ie it would turn a disk into a _really_ simple filesystem with
   just one big file ;).
 - it will make MM handling much better for things like fsck - the memory
   pressure is designed to work on page cache things.
 - it will be one less thing that uses the buffer cache as a "cache" (I
   want people to think of, and use, the buffer cache as an _IO_ entity,
   not a cache).
It will not make the "cache at bootup" thing change at all (because even
in the page cache, there is no commonality between a virtual mapping of a
_file_ (or metadata) and a virtual mapping of a _disk_). 
It would have hidden the problem with "dd" or "dump" touching buffer cache
blocks that the filesystem was using, so the original metadata corruption
that started this thread would not happen. But that's not a design issue
or a design goal, that would just have been a random result.
