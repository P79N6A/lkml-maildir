Except that there is no such thing :) there is the CONFIG_PMAC_PBOOK
thing but that will be going away soon as it's over abused.
You may want to make it CONFIG_PPC_PMAC if you want, but it doesn't
really matter as the option will not cause any problem on non-powerbook
and it will still build. Beside, who knows, it might even end up being
useful on the Intel Macs if Linux ever runs on them :)
