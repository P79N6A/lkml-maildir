Hi all,
It seems that recent (and maybe not so recent) linux kernels have a TCP
problem that causes them to acknowledge almost every segment. While,
strictly speaking, this is not against the spec, any sane TCP only acks
every second segment in steady state. The statistics appended below
illustrate the problem.
Why do I care? Because I'm connected through a cable network with a
severe bandwidth asymmetry; the upstream is rate limited to 256 kbps,
while the downstream can theoretically yield 10 Mbps (assuming a quiet
period). Right now, the excessive ack rate seems to be a limiting factor
on peak performance.
I've already disabled quickacks, replaced the receive MSS estimate with
advertised MSS in the ack sending policy (two places), and removed one
dubious "immediate ack" condition from send_delay_ack(). The annoying
thing is that none of this seem to make any real difference. I must be
missing something huge that's right in front of my nose, but I'm
starting to run out of steam.
Any thoughts on this?
Regards,
	MikaL
