I think we're assuming that we don't have to because the problem is fixed 
by the "cpus_and(tmp, cpumask, cpu_online_map)" in flush_tlb_others so we 
don't have to. Except it's racy, and doesn't work.
It would seem to me that your suggestion would fix it. But isn't locking
cpu_online_map both simpler and (most importantly) more generic? I can't 
imagine that we don't use this elsewhere ... suppose for instance we took 
a timer interrupt, causing a scheduler rebalance, and moved a process to 
an offline CPU at that point? Isn't any user of smp_call_function also racy?
Not locking it just seems fundamentally dangerous to me ... maybe I'm 
wrong though.
