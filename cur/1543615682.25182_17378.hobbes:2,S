Linux 2.4.x to 2.4.18pre1 on both HP LH6000r and LH4r has the same
problem with the eepro100. Network (rcp) became very slow after warn
reboot.
I've tried both with "modprobe eepro100" (10BT) and "modprobe eepro100
options=0x30" (100BT) and each time after a warm reboot, the network came
to a crawl. The only way is to cold reset by power off/on the system.
Here's the card ("modprobe eepro100 options=0x30") ...
eth0: OEM i82557/i82558 10/100 Ethernet, 00:30:6E:01:A8:8D, IRQ 18.
  Receiver lock-up bug exists -- enabling work-around.
  Board assembly 506495-096, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  Forcing 100Mbs full-duplex operation.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x04f4518b).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
Thanks,
Jeff
