This is actually a good point.  Since the CPU vendor managed to
completely fuck up the operation of MMCONFIG itself on this CPU (it's a
*MEMORY REFERENCE*, guys!), it is actually to be expected and prudent
that BIOS vendors will drop the MCFG entry.  MMCONFIG doesn't actually
work on this CPU for any system software which doesn't already know to
work around this particular piece of severe braindamage;
standards-complicant MMCONFIG isn't supported at all.
