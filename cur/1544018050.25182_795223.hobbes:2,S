But, memcg requires much memory to track usage of pages, a page_cgroup structure, 
40bytes per page on 64bit, 20bytes per page on 32bit.
Probably, for embeded people, this additinal memory usage is not acceptable.
Below is just a noise:
==
As my personal project, I'd like to write on-demand-fake-numa for generic archs.
Now, section size is 128MB on x86-64. I'd like to allow following ops.
  # create_new_node (echo node_number > /sys/device/system/node/add_fake_node)
  # offline memory (echo offline > /sys/device/system/memory/memoryXXX/state)
  # attach offlined memory to new node
                   (echo node_number > /sys/device/system/memory/memoryXXX/attach)
  # online memmory (echo online > /sys/device/system/memory/memoryXXX/state)
Then, memoryXXX (128MB of chunk of memory) is controlled under a new fake node
"node_number".
For embeded systems, you may be able to modify SECTION_SIZE smaller (8-16MB?) and
cpuset will give them enough resource isolation.
(But not so flexible as memory cgroup.)
you can use node+cpuset information to track memory usage by apps.
Note: OOM-Killer kills process within cpuset.
