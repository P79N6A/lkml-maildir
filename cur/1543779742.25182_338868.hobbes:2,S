Fixing the applications I can understand but the patch still seems 
necessary, to me, so the
HDIO_GET_GEO returns "rational" values.
I tested  HDIO_GET_GEO and it returns the same broken values as go into 
/proc (no surprises) without my patch.
If a drive is in LBA mode (28 or 48 bit) the existing code doesn't 
always "fix up" the geometry properly for some value returns. It only 
tries with 48 bit mode and it fails there for some values.  My patch 
forces a complete geometry and appears (to me) to preserve the side 
efefcts of the existing code.
Am I missing something?
