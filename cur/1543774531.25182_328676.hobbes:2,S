You are so right, I am.  I need to be pleasing me, and devfs in the
kernel is not the correct solution.  I knew this 4 years ago when Pat
and I started working on the driver core (my main goal was to do it to
support a udev-like solution), and I still know this today.
So no, I'm not going to be submitting this.  But what it is, is a nice
proof-of-concept for people who "just can't live without a in-kernel
devfs" to show that it can be done in less than 300 lines of code, and
only 6 hooks (2 functions in 3 different places) in the main kernel
tree.  That is managable outside of the main kernel for years, with
almost little to no effort.

Yes, I'm going to start working with some of the people who really know
this stuff (the distro developers who make the whole dynamic boot and
early boot process work correctly) and we will hash out a coheirant
future together, and document it all really well.
But I'm going to wait to do that till next week, the sun is shining, the
beer is cold, and I'm going to relax now...
Thanks for calling me on this, I appreciate it.  You weren't the only
one either, which is a good thing.
