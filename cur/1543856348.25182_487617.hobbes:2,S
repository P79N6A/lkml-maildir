This is insufficient for some cases. Someone needs to set the enabled
value to one for unclaimed devices which are found to be enabled at boot
time (IO/MEM set) otherwise the stacking will fail on things like a
CS5520 where the firmware has set it enabled and if you disable it your
system dies on the spot.
Otherwise this looks most welcome.
