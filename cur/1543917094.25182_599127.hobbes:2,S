Generally, the rule is "don't (re)invent another debug system"

Oh that's either old code or code that has not been reviewed properly.
Fact is that I have been made aware of pr_debug() "often enough"
on netfilter-devel, and it looks like a good idea.

Surprise, pr_debug() is just that all nicely wrapped up.
Want debug? Do it like this.
#ifdef CONFIG_UNIONFS_DEBUG
#	define DEBUG 1
#endif
and pr_debug() works magic.

>(e.g., affs and configfs) use it.  But pr_debug is only active when #define

No I do not think so. But when you grep for dprintk, you should also
grep for DEBUG, to be fair :p
