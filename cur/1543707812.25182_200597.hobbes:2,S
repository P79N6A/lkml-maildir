Hi!
>  how is it possible to transfer data across two PC using the sound card.
It would be actually pretty nice project ;-). Its not at all easy.
I was able to transfer data using dtmf and dtmf decoder (PC beeper to
internal microphone of notebook), but with advanced software much
better speed should be possible.
