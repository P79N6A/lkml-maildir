I2C is the main communication path for it, although there are callback
mechanisms available which add the possibility for different configuration
paths.

The analogue tuner core is also only for i2c only devices which most
devices rely on.

What holds companies for using the current available code putting it
into an rpm or deb package and releasing such code now?
The Avermedia example I pointed out to is a good example already.
As from my side I won't release binary drivers.
Although on the other side:
* are drivers from vendors which work through several kernel versions
that bad?
* Why did someone duallicense videodev2 with BSD/GPL?
I would appreciate if someone else on the list could also comment
the reason that drivers should all be included in the linuxkernel just
because forcing the companies to release binary drivers because
of that. My opinion about that is if a company wants to go opensource
they will do so, if not they will either not release a driver or release
nothing.
