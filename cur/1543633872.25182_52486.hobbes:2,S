Thanks for the patch, I can see where you're headed more clearly.
Comments:
* You absolutely need a separate _assign_irq().  request_irq() and 
free_irq() are used today as the points which enable and disable an irq 
for a device.
* You want to keep pci_enable_device(), such that, in driver code it 
does not need to be moved.  This is an important hook for hotplug PCI 
and cardbus and such things, which need a point where they may enable 
the device as a whole.  One important function pci_enable_device() does 
now, for example, is bring the PCI device to D0 full-power-on state.
* Remember that you must handle two cases here:  1) BIOS-pre-assigned 
region values, and 2) on-the-fly assigned values.  Drivers needs to work 
transparently such that, on a desktop PCI system, pci_request_regions() 
is _really_ all the reservation they need.  And the same driver, using 
the same code, should handle cardbus and other systems that are having 
resources assigned to them dynamically.  I don't really care that much 
how's it's implemented behind-the-scenes, as long as the end-result 
driver code handles both these cases without a forest of "if's" and 
"ifdef's"
