Kernel compiles are not how to stress these. The way to stress them is
to have multiple simultaneous independent chains of communicators and
deeper chains of communicators.
Kernel compiles are little but background cpu/memory load for these
sorts of tests. Something expected to have some sort of mutual
interference depending on quality of implementation would be a better
sort of competing load, one vastly more reflective of real workloads.
For instance, another set of processes communicating using the same
primitive.
Perhaps best of all would be a macrobenchmark utilizing a variety of
the primitives under consideration. Unsurprisingly, major commercial
databases do so for major benchmarks.
