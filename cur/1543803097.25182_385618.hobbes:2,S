Hi Greg, I stopped because I noticed that part of patch 2 had slipped
into patch 3 (the bit that slipped was exactly the tweak I made to patch 2
to have it compile by itself... probably ended up in patch 3 due to a
forgotten "quilt refresh"), and I wanted to check all the other patches.
They are fine, so I have now sent them.  However, patch 2 won't compile
unless you apply patch 3 as well. Since they are both trivial, I hope you
are ok with that, otherwise I can rediff them
All the best,
Duncan.
