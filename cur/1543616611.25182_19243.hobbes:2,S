well the biggest serial.c offender is block_til_ready of course...
oh and there's quite some dusty old code that does
save_flags();
cli();
while (some_condition)
	sleep_on(&queue);
eg not re-disabling interrupts after the sleep_on().....
to the point where just about every use of
sleep_on/interruptible_sleep_on is buggy
except in serial.c ;(
