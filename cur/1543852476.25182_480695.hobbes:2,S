The two wacom_be16_to_cpu are in wacom_intuos_irq, which has nothing to do with Volito2. Volito2 uses wacom_graphire_irq. I am not exactly sure what Andrew's problem is. 
Andrew, please surf the discussion forum at 
http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/
 to see if there is anything similiar to your problem.
Ping
