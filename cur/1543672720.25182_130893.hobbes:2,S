    I had a similar problem with my init clone (a virtual console
init+getty+login for embedded systems) with the same issue. I wanted
to change the argv[0] for spawned processes for chaging the name that
the ps command will show. At the end I assumed that the shortest name
possible was 'init' and that I had four characters at least... If the
space is shorter, less characters are used.

    IMHO this is a good thing, I hope it gets included, since in the
general case it won't do any harm (IMHO, again). Let's see what says
Marcelo.

    Don't know :??
