Actually, yes. I was adding to this patch something to be more specific,
and to either pass the EIP through the parameter or a __FILE__, __LINE__.
Using the following:
#ifdef CONFIG_KMALLOC_ACCOUNTING
# define __EIP__ , __builtin_return_address(0)
# define __DECLARE_EIP__ , void *eip
#else
# define __EIP__
# define __DECLARE_EIP__
#endif
#define kstrdup(s,g) __kstrdup(s, g __EIP__)
extern char *__kstrdup(const char *s, gfp_t g __DECLARE_EIP__);
Or a file line can be used:
# define __EIP__ , __FILE__, __LINE__
# define __DECLARE_EIP__ , char *file, int line
