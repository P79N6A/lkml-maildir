Definately.  Here's what I did.  The laptop I was testing has 2.6.12-rc2
installed (it's a multi boot).  This kernel was compiled specifically for
the laptop since it's one that I use for work.  The kernel I compiled with
-Os is a generic and this laptop was the only one I had to test this with. 
So basically, you could say this laptop currently has 2 linux installations
on it.  The generic one I'm trying to get partially on a floppy and it's
normal one.
I was first booting from floppy to test.  The kernel on the floppy is
compield with -Os and the kernel itself is compressed with upx-ucl-beta to
make it smaller.  Then it has a gzipped initrd with busybox and some
modules.  I call this stage1.  stage2 which has the pcmcia module comes from
either a cdrom or a usb stick (I have stage 1 on the laptop hdd, but stage 2
still comes from usb).  Figuring there might have been a problem with upx, I
decided to through the stage1 on my laptop's hdd (since it can't boot from
usb).  This time, I recompiled the kernel (make clean, remove optimize for
size, make bzImage modules, install modules to the usb stick and select ones
for the initrd).  Once I did this, pcmcia worked.  The configuration was the
same, all that changed was not using -Os.

I'll forward this diff to myself at work and test it.  Thanks.  I'll let you
know what happens.
