That could be done, but I wouldn't know where to start and where to end.
Moving simply all definitions to mm_types.h doesn't seem to be a good
solution. E.g. having something like "struct shrinker" in mm_types.h
seems to be rather pointless IMHO.
Maybe we can simply leave it by just taking the struct page definition
out for now?
