I haven't tried this patch yet, but i have a question regarding the
mlockall issue:
Jackd also uses IPC mechnisms for remote procedure calls [i think,
please correct me] and makes heavy use of shared memory. Might
mlock(all) have influence of this? is jackd maybe producing xruns
because some IPC stuff blocks when mlockall is used?
I'm just guessing wildly and uneducatedly..
