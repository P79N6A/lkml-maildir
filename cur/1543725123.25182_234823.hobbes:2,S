Do you mean Dipankar had noted as in:

If that is what you want, the api cannot work well.
The problem with this case is I cannot use hashed spinlock _just_ for
kref_get_rcu as Dipankar mentions above.  If I do that the atomic_inc s
in kref_get will race with the 'hashed spinlock' kref_get_rcu when 
both have to be used on the same refcounter.  (I mentioned this in an 
earlier post).  So I have to take the same hashed spinlock for kref_gets as 
well to maintain correctness -- obviously not a good thing for arches 
with no cmpxchg which use krefs for non lock free purposes only.  
Hence, the proposal now is to add kref_lf_get, kref_lf_put, kref_lf_get_rcu 
to the kref api.  kref_lf_xxx is to be used when the kref refcounter
is used atleast one place lock free -- that is kref_lf_get_rcu is used
at atleast once on the struct kref.  Does that sound ok?
Thanks,
Kiran
