-dst_type takes values 0 (satellite), 1 (terrestial TV), 2 (cable).
+The DST module takes a couple of useful parameters.
 
-dst_type_flags takes bit combined values:
-1 = new tuner type packets. You can use this if your card is detected
-    and you have debug and you continually see the tuner packets not
-    working (make sure not a basic problem like dish alignment etc.)
+verbose takes values 0 to 5. These values control the verbosity level.
 
-2 = TS 204. If your card tunes OK, but the picture is terrible, seemingly
-    breaking up in one half continually, and crc fails a lot, then
-    this is worth a try (or trying to turn off)
+debug takes values 0 and 1. You can either disable or enable debugging.
 
-4 = has symdiv. Some cards, mostly without new tuner packets, require
-    a symbol division algorithm. Doesn't apply to terrestial TV.
+dst_addons takes values 0 and 0x20. A value of 0 means it is a FTA card.
+0x20 means it has a Conditional Access slot.
 
-You can also specify a value to have the autodetected values turned off
-(e.g. 0). The autodected values are determined bythe cards 'response
+The autodected values are determined bythe cards 'response
