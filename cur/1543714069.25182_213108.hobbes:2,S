In linux 2.4.25 there is no LSM and thus no vulnerability.
linux-2.4.25/fs/exec.c:
		lock_kernel();
		if (must_not_trace_exec(current)
		    || atomic_read(&current->fs->count) > 1
		    || atomic_read(&current->files->count) > 1
		    || atomic_read(&current->sig->count) > 1) {
			if(!capable(CAP_SETUID)) {
				bprm->e_uid = current->uid;
				bprm->e_gid = current->gid;
			}
			if(!capable(CAP_SETPCAP)) {
				new_permitted = cap_intersect(new_permitted,
							current->cap_permitted);
			}
		}
		do_unlock = 1;
