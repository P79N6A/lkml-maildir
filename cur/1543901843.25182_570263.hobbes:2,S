Seems like it's just development/testing code that shouldn't escape
into the wild?

As I said I definitely think the dist_eqs switch doesn't sound like
something we want to expose to people.
With that said I still am not sure about putting the multiple EQs
feature in this release.  All the infrastructure is there to make
experimenting with it fairly painless (just the low-level driver needs
to change), and I still haven't seen much code using the feature or
even any anecdotal information about the performance impact.
