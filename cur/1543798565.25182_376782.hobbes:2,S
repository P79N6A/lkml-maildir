Actually, that last part is false (or maybe just misleading). You can
create threads without CLONE_FS to get a per-thread cwd/chroot/umask, no
"virtual" required.
Don't take this as an objection to implementation of the *at() syscalls
in Linux, though; rather, look at is as a request for the addition of
int pthread_attr_setfssharing_np(pthread_attr_t *attr, int share) and
int pthread_attr_getfssharing_np(pthread_attr_t *attr) to glibc.
