The following series of patches are strict bugfix patches taken from the
debian kernel. Among the various Debian patches, these were deemed
critical enough by me (e.g. not compilefixes or comment fixes) to merit
consideration for 2.6.7.
Each patch is accompanied with a hyperlink to the Debian BTS entry for
the bug it fixes and an except from the bugreport it addresses.
These patches were all written by others, in most of the cases, Herbert Xu.
hch did the work of splitting these out from Debian cvs.
