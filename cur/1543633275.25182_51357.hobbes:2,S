It provides read and write and create support, for the types that are
reasonably supportable. The description is on
	
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~adelton/linux/vfat-symlink/vfat-symlink.readme
and the patch is next to it.

Right. The patch adds support for creating symlinks via .lnk files.

Well, because the .lnk approach in the patch is compatible both with
the Windows behaviour and the cygwin behaviour, you're getting rather
transparent symlink support.

That may be true but the notebook I got last October came with Win ME
-- just FAT32, no NTFS. So they may be killing it but it's still
around and it will be for some time to come.

Can't comment on that as I don't have NTFS handy. The patch makes it
possible to mount vfat aprtition in such a way that .lnk files are not
shown as a binary mess but as a symlink, the same way they look (from
user's perspective) in Windows and in cygwin.
