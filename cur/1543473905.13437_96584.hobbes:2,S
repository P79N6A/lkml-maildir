I'm not sure about anonymous access to kernel.org, but I think you 
will find the the us mirror at katelyn.optilinkcomm.net is sufficiently
quick.

Is anonymous access to kernel.org permanently gone now?  I'm finding
that the US mirrors are actually _slower_ that kernel.org used to be,
plus they don't carry .bz2 files, which for those of us crippled by a
slow modem connection are really nice.
