Sandisk I think. Looking at the corruption pattern and actual disk
behaviour might be informative. Its possible the vendor has done
something silly like teach the firmware 'tricks' about FAT file
systems that depend on exact windows behaviour I guess.
Might be interesting to see what it does given a totally not FAT
environment (eg fill the disk start to end with each sector filled
with its sector number repeatedly) and see what comes out the other
end.
