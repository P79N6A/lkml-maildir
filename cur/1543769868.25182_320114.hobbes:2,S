Subject: [PATCH] mmap topdown fix for large stack limit, large allocation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/23/124

The topdown changes in 2.6.12-rc1 can cause large allocations with
large stack limit to fail, despite there being space available.  The
mmap_base-len is only valid when len >= mmap_base.  However, nothing in
topdown allocator checks this.  It's only (now) caught at higher level,
which will cause allocation to simply fail.  The following change restores
the fallback to bottom-up path, which will allow large allocations with
large stack limit to potentially still succeed.
