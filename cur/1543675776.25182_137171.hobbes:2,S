Sorry, the netlib program couldn't understand your request.  
Here are some example requests, in case syntax is the problem:
          send index
          send index for eispack
          send rg from eispack
          who is Gene Golub
          find fft
Due to the stupid, one-pass nature of the parsing program, if you
put the request in the header Subject: line and some mailer puts
that line before any address line, netlib won't know who you are.
Sorry, that will be fixed someday;  in the meantime, put the
request in the message body proper.
