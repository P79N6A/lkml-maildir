I'm certainly not running any powersaving features on my athlon-tbird(it 
doesn't have any AFAIK, and its the hottest running AMD processor there 
is) However I've realized I did have cool n' quiet with the ondemand 
governor running on my athlon64, so that might indicate an issue, again, 
I'll look into that tonight.
