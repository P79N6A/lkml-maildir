Hi!
I see your point to some degree...

Unless your work will be accepted in the vanilla kernel, you will might 
consider making your code a bit more generic.
E.g. these two statements of disallowing creation of hardlinks and regular 
files in /dev can easily be implemented as a LSM module (see 
include/linux/security.h). (I think) You will need to consider the hooks 
inode_create and inode_link only.
Cheers, KS.
