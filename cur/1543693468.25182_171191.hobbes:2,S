Sorry, but that fix is already in 2.6.0-test6-mm4; that's why I tested
that version...
Anyway, I added some printk's like this:
                case EV_REP:
                        printk( KERN_INFO "atkbd: atkbd_softrepeat %d\n", atkbd_softrepeat);
                        if (atkbd_softrepeat) return 0;
                        i = j = 0;
                        while (i < 32 && period[i] < dev->rep[REP_PERIOD]) i++;
                        while (j < 4 && delay[j] < dev->rep[REP_DELAY]) j++;
                        dev->rep[REP_PERIOD] = period[i];
                        dev->rep[REP_DELAY] = delay[j];
                        printk( KERN_INFO "atkbd: period %d delay %d\n", period[i], delay[j]);
                        param[0] = i | (j << 5);
                        atkbd_command(atkbd, param, ATKBD_CMD_SETREP);
                        return 0;
And even if my command-line for the kernel looks like this:
Kernel command line: root=/dev/md3 video=matroxfb:xres:1600,yres:1360,depth:16,pixclock:4116,left:304,right:64,upper:46,lower:1,hslen
:192,vslen:3,fv:90,hwcursor=off hdb=scsi apm=power-off atkbd_softrepeat=1
I still see this:
:kbdrate -r 50 -d 100
atkbd: atkbd_softrepeat 0
atkbd: period 33 delay 250
atkbd: atkbd_softrepeat 0
atkbd: period 33 delay 250
Typematic Rate set to 30.3 cps (delay = 250 ms)
and I still get only 800 cpm, which means 14 cps or so.
Why it atkbd_softrepeat still 0 with this command-line?
Kind regards,
Jurriaan
