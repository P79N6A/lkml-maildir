Hi!
[And they get worse in fbcon-test patches I tried].
Try this on 2.4 (with vesafb).
echo -e "\33[10;5000]\33[11;50]\33[?18;0;136c\33[?102m"
...then try it on 2.6, type foo in bash then delete it using
backspace; ghost cursors stay there. Run emacs and quit it (it sets
cursor to very visible). Boom, special cursor settings are gone.
And now, use gpm on text console to select some text. Hold down left
button, move mouse a bit. Sometimes cursor gets corrupted and stays
there.
