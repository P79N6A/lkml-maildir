Hi,

Controlling resource assignment, I think that concept is good.
But the design is another matter that it seems somewhat overkilled
with the current CKRM.

I believe this feature would also make desktop users happier -- controlling
X-server, mpeg player, video capturing and all that -- if the code
becomes much simpler and easier to use.

That makes sense.

From a standpoint of the users, CKRM and CPUSETS should be managed
seamlessly through the same interface though I'm not sure whether
your idea is the best yet.
