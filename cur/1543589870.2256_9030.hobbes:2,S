Ehh. Doing that would be extremely stupid, and would slow down your boot
and nothing more.
The page cache is _not_ coherent with the buffer cache. Any filesystem
that uses the page cache for data caching (which pretty much all of them
do, because it's the only way to get sane mmap semantics, and it's a lot
faster than the ol dbuffer cache ever was), the above will do _nothing_
but spend time doing IO that the page cache will just end up doing again.
Currently it can help to pre-load the meta-data, but quite frankly, even
that is suspect, and won't work in 2.5.x when Al's metadata page-cache
stuff is merged (at least directories, and likely inodes too).
In short, don't do it. It doesn't work reliably (and hasn't since 2.0.x),
and it will only get more and more unreliable.
