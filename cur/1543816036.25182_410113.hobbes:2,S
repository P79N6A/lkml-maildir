On "cache pages" you mean :) 
Yes, some low-level mechanisms have also been abstracted away... I think
a nice way to avoid explicit knowledge of page reference acquision at
the moment of candidate selection hasnt been found.
Do you have any suggestions?

I guess Peter and myself expected folks to criticise and help shape the
API to something acceptable.
BTW, patches 1 and 25 are not crucial improvements for mainline (there's
not much point in having them in mainline), and I don't see any others?

"pgrep_" looks more pleasant to me.

Aren't we talking about very different things here? IMHO there is a lot
of point in allowing pluggable page replacement instead of trying to
make one policy fit all needs (which is obviously impossible).

Indeed - Peter has done a very nice job.
