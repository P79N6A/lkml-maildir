ok, now that I've got the attention of anyone reading this post,
here goes:
The paper entitled "Adaptive Domain Environment for Operating
Systems", which I published in February 2001 presents a design
*PLAN*. The actual implementation is based on this paper, but
differs *SIGNIFICANTLY* from it. Hence, read the paper to
understand how the ipipe works *ONLY*. All this stuff about
ring 0 / ring 1 was *NEVER* implemented.
To understand what's in the current *PATCH*, please read this
instead:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102309348817485&w=2
Here's the relevant passage:

Again, Adeos does not play *ANY* ring tricks. It just hooks
onto the kernel's *EXISTING* cli/sti/int-delivery mechanisms
using a *PATCH*.
Hope this helps dissipate some misconceptions about what Adeos
is *TODAY*.
P.S.: Sorry Daniel, none of the above emphasis is directed
personally towards you. I just know from talking to quite a
few people that my original paper *CONTINUES* to *MISLEAD*
people about what Adeos currently is. So I just thought I'd
make it clear at this point for those interested.
