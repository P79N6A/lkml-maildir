What the Rest Of The World could probably use is if some kind soul were to go
through and build a .21->.22 document that lists all the *userspace visible*
changes (new drivers, new filesystems/features, new/changed stuff in /sys and
/proc, new ioctls, new and changed Kconfig, etc).  Unfortunately, it's quite
probably not automagically creatable, so we'd need to find another Adrian Bunk
to do it (BTW, between cleanups and keeping track of regressions and so on,
Adrian is definitely a resource we're lucky to have - let's have a round of
applause and appreciation for all of Adrian's work.. :)

I'm not really a git user (I have enough trouble keeping a -mm tree around in
an unbusticated state) - but the few times I've needed info from git, I've
gotten it from the git-web interface.  I think I've only looked at the
Changelogs once in the last 5 years, and it was because I was researching a
"When did feature XYZ go into the kernel?" for something that happened before
the bitkeeper and git days.
