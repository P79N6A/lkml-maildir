Possibly, however, the fact is that those quirks "just worked" on all HW
where we used them in the past, so while in "theory" they are incorrect,
in practice, this is a regression and thus needs to be fixed.

I would argue to you that the whole legacy PCI thing is mostly
"undefined behaviour" from day 1. We rely on what worked in practice for
us, period. It's broken now, this is a regression. I'm not saying we
should revert the change in the generic code, I'm just raising an alarm
here as I doubt we are the only platform to do that (heh, I didn't even
write those quirks in the first place) and some fixing is needed in that
area. I'm totally fine with changing the quirks to do the "right"
though.

Quite possibly, though as I said in practice, what we did so far
happened to "just work" on pretty much everything we were faced with
(which iirc is basically winbond and VIA controllers, possibly a few
others).
Anyway, I'll scrub around. Again, I'm not saying the approach is wrong
in the generic code.
