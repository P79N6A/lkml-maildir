  The problem here is that the stateless client/server model of NFS
forces us into this sort of situation. Staleness checking etc in the
NFS model is the responsability of the server, not the client.
  In your testcase, if you remove "d", the server will report the
handle for "d'" as being stale the next time you try to use it. The
only thing you lose by allowing aliased directory trees is the
'guarantee' as to whether it is safe to delete something or not. Such
a guarantee can in any case not be given under the NFS model.
Consider
  client (Process 1)      client (Process 2)                server
  cd ~/a
  open (somefile, O_RDWR)
                                                            cd ~
							    mv a b
                          cd ~/b
                          open (somefile, O_RDONLY)
                                                            rm -rf b
Cheers,
