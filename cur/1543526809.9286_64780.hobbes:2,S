Amin,
I think I agree that this post on Microsoft's website contains incorrect
statements that do not address customer needs.  It's also clear to me
that even purely from a completely Microsoft-biased viewpoint, it's
embarassing and childish for Microsoft to post content this inaccurate. 
I will talk to some folks I know up there.
Thanks for pointing this out.
Jeff
