The external references are dropped when calling invalidate_range_begin. 
This would work both for the KVM and the GRU. Why would KVM not be able to 
invalidate the range before? Locking conventions is that no additional 
external reference can be added between invalidate_range_begin and 
invalidate_range_end. So KVM is fine too.

mremap uses do_munmap which calls into unmap_region() that already has 
callbacks. So what is wrong there?
