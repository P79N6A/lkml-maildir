Instead of ioctls I would actually prefer something akin to to the plan
9 model where each device is actually a directory with two files:  a
data file and a control file.  Instead of opening the device and
calling ioctls you would instead open the control channel and read()
and write() messages.  The big win here would be easy userspace
emulation of (character) devices.  The old ioctls could be implemented
as wrappers around reading and writing the control channel.
Passing ioctls across the net becomes as simple as writing a daemon to
monitor a named pipe and forward the messages across the network to
a daemon on the remote machine which would access the real device.
Of course, using a pair of named pipes would only work for emulating
character devices.  Perhaps playing around with a mmap()ed regular file
would work to emulate block devices, but this might require too much
overhead.
(Not that I object to your new ioctl interface, or some more standardization
of ioctls.  Both would IMHO be useful)
