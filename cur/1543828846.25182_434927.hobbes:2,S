It's is an abuse of i_pipe.  You are using something which is supposed
to hold a struct pipe_info, and storing the head of the STREAM stack,
which is some other type.  
In any case, when you state authoratively what "can" and "can not" be
combined, please specify when your justification is for a particular
out of tree modules.
