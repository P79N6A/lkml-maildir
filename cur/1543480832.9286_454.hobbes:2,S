"two thirds of bugger-all"
  9:19am  up 6 days, 22:30, 16 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.09, 0.08
16 users, all of them me. (rxvt's)
This machine is my personal workstation - it runs several rxvt's and
displays a netscape (which is executed on another machine with it's
display set to mine) - that's about it.
Oh, and it runs a little perl script every 5 minutes that checks to see
all our servers are still up, and pages me if one of them is dead.. I've
been getting false alarms lately because the machine is running out of
inodes so ping etc can't create new filehandles
(at least I'm assuming that's what's happening)
live:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr 
108480  13681
live:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-max 
131072
It seems to have stablised now though - it's been at this value for almost
3 days.
