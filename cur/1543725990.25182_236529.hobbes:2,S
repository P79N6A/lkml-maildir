Which architecture does _not_ use DEBUG_KERNEL or DEBUG_SLAB? The list is quite
long... Aren't these generic?
Perhaps DEBUG_SPINLOCK can depend on just SMP only? Or do people want to debug
spinlock code on machines that don't have SMP?
Perhaps DEBUG_HIGHMEM can depend on just HIGHMEM only?
(didn't check the whole list) Perhaps the first instance of DEBUG_INFO
can depend on !SUPERH64 && !USERMODE only?
