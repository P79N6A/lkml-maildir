I suspect you do the freeserve guys a great disrespect (they host
ftp.linux.org.uk for one thing). If you've got traces showing what freeserve
stuff is mishandling ECN I'll have a chat with the right people
The Register can probably also be persuaded easily enough (make fun of them
on other sites as they make fun of incompetent IT sites and wait..)
BT well, there are reasons I don't even have a BT telephone line in my house.
