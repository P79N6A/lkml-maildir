First I'd cc ext3-users@redhat.com
If your processes are waiting on something you'll need to show what they're
waiting in (ps axl).
Do you get any other error messages in your kernel logs?  Does your network
connection keep working when NFS serving stops?
run sysrq+t at the time you're having the problem, and run it through
ksymoops.
Oh, and for small lists it's ok to just include it in the email body.
