Sure I always do in the same way!
I go in /usr/src and rm -r linux and rm linux-2.4.5 (the kernel installed 
with Slackware 7.0) then downloaded kernel 2.4.17
make mrproper and reconfigured my kernel.
I create a script to compile the kernel, so I'm sure I do al the same 
everytime.
The script is:
#mkernel begin
#!/bin/sh
make dep && make clean && make bzImage && make modules
make modules_install
cp System.map /boot
cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot
lilo
#mkernel end

I have problem with iptables.o and with apm.o.
For apm I haven't found help and I never create a working modules so I 
compiled it in the kernel.
I was sure that iptables works like modules and now it's working fine on 
that system with 2.4.16
Any suggestions?
