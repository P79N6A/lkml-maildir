And encryption is in fact much more needed than compression. Remember,
you are writing everything in memory (including maybe ssh passphrases or
gpg keys) to swap in clear text. Not nice. And i agree that compression
is nice to have, too.

This can easily be done by a userspace helper. You do use the
(userspace) X server to display your GUI, don't you?
Putting only the absolutely necessary things into the kernel (the same
is true for the interactive resume thing - if someone wants interactive
startup at a failing resume, he has to use an initrd, i don't see a
problem with that) will probably increase the acceptance a bit :-)
