As far as I understand it, RSDL always gives an equal share of cpu, but 
interactive tasks can have lower latency, right? So you get in trouble with 
interactive tasks only when their share isn't enough to actually do what they 
have to do in that period, eg on a heavily (over?) loaded box. Staircase, 
like mainline which gave them MORE than their share, would support that 
(though this comes at a price).
So, if your box is overloaded to a great extend, X, which can use a lot of 
cpu, can get unresponsive - unless it's negatively niced. But most other apps 
aren't as demanding as X is, so they won't really suffer. Thus the problem is 
mostly X. And at least part of that problem is being solved - X wasting cpu 
cycles. Also, cpu's are getting stronger, and I think it's likely X's 
relative CPU usage goes down as well.
In the long term, RSDL seems like the best way to go. Nice X down, and you got 
most of the disadvantages. You still have the perfect fairness, no stalls and 
starvation ;-)
If RSDL can be improved to help X, great. But introducing again the problem 
which RSDL was supposed to solve would be pretty pointless. I think that's 
what grumpy Con is trying to say, and he's right at it.
