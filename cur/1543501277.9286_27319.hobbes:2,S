Hi,
I've made an adjustment to bigphysarea which I think fixes the
interction with initrd and lilo. It compiles and is running as I write.
Initrd is compiled in, but I don't exercise it properly. I'd appreciate
testing by anyone who could use this.
It's posted at:
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bpa-config-initrd-2.2.10.gz
Unmodified versions remain available through my homepage there. The
patch for 2.2.9 has offsets in the 2.2.10 arch/arm and arch/ppc
configuration files, but it all works out ok.
Tom
