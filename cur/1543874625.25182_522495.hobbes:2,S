Hello
I uploaded the output of dmesg (kernel 2.6.21-rc4-git5) (battery / ac)
and dmidecode
I can boot on battery with nolapic_timer and the second core is online, too.
/proc/acpi/processor/C000/ shows the same as before but
/proc/interrupts has changed:
(battery)
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      47131          0  local-APIC-edge-fasteoi   timer
LOC:          0      46978
(ac)
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      59137          0  local-APIC-edge-fasteoi   timer
LOC:          0      58984
