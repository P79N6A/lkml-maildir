Hi Jeremy,
It's good to hear some experience from the Valgrind world :-)

There seem to be many structures containing mostly data and only one
or two list_head structures with pointers. Here only the list_head
member would need to be scanned.

This is done already by the DEBUG_SLAB configuration.

Kmemleak only accepts values that point to either the beginning of the
allocated block or to one of its aliases (a offset from the beginning
which is determined from the container_of() usages on that
structure/member - most of the list usages). There is a discussion one
whether to allow a value to point anywhere inside a block but I would
need to investigate the risks.

This would increase the overhead as in my tests around 15% of all the
values scanned look like pointers (i.e. between PAGE_OFFSET and
PAGE_OFFSET + ram_size).

This is pretty rare and you can easily tell kmemleak to ignore it.
