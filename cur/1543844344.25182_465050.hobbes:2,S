I had 3 sources for this:
1. win64 binary driver
2. linux binary driver - it says its license is GPL, but source is nowhere to be found
3. OMAP 5912 datasheet for part of the tifm_sd functionality
My upcoming memorystick driver only draws from the first two sources. I should also add that I
never worked for TI nor Everest Consulting (the authors of the binary driver) and don't know
anybody who ever did.

I actually marked them "inline" to signify the fact that only one callsite is intended for these
functions. They are not intended to be called from arbitrary places (no problem to fix those,
though).
