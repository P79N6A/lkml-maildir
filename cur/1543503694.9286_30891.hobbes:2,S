I can not confirm the problem with SCSI resets.
Basically, a driver has to detect, when a SCSI reset occurs.
Ii has to tell the mid-layer that all commands already sent were aborted
(DID_RESET) and reset it's negotiation params (Sync, Wide). That's all,
basically. 
I've operated a SCSI bus with several controllers without problems, BTw. The
combination was a NCR53c875 (DC390F) and a AM53C974 (DC390).
I see another problem: The box which mounts the FS read-only will have
inconcsistent buffers and you'll probably see lots of fs warnings. The
reasons is buffering: The data and metadata on disk has been updated by the
RW box, but the RPO box has still outdated buffers. Now, when some buffers
are read in, you get inconsistent states. So your RO box should bypass the
buffer cache. (Test it and use flushb for discarding the buffers.)
