A fairytale here tells that a local small bussiness has sold to military a
lot of computers and software and installation support.
As in military there is everything listed in inventory, so the deal was:
2.4 Kg of linux "kernel" (in english).
With warranty.
If not handled or stored properly, warranty will be void.
More fun came when revidents demanded to see "this material, whatever it
is"
Lucky people they did not sell it as 2.4 Tonns of something.
