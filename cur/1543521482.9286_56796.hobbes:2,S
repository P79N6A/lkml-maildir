Works happily on mine (OEM Ensoniq AudioPCI, 2.2.14 SMP w/ DVD/IDE
and APM patches):
es1370: version v0.30 time 23:48:32 Jan  5 2000
es1370: found adapter at io 0xdc80 irq 18
es1370: features: joystick off, line in, mic impedance 0
es1370: unloading
The ALSA driver (
http://www.alsa-project.org
) also works fine for me, and
is what I normally use.
