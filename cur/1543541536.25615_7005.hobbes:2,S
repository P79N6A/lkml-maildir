I'd much rather just have a very simple rule: if it doesn't start with a
slash, then it's not a "real" path.
And move "(deleted)" to the front of the name rather than the end.
(Note that the "doesn't start with a slash" rule is for more things than
deleted files: it's pipes, sockets, whatever. So that one is independent
of how we do deleted).
I dislike the "//" syntax a lot. It has potential special semantics in
POSIX, and it _is_ a valid root-based filename even without those
semantics. And some day we may take advantage of the POSIX-blessed "//"
syntax extensions.
In contrast, if you get a path that doesn't start with a '/', then you
know a priori that it cannot be a full pathname. It could obviously be a
relative one, but for something that is supposed to return the full
path that isn't an issue, so there is no possibility for confusion.
