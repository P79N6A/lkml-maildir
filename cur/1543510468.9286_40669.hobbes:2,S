Hi there.
I'm not sure what's actually happenning here, but here's the
description...
 1. Boot up my AMD K6-2/350 (stepping 0) system. 64M of RAM,
    6.4G and 2.1G hard drives on hda and hdc respectively,
    24xCDROM on hdd. System boots fine.
 2. Anything I run before running rc5des runs fine, and I
    can't cause any problems whatsoever.
 3. If I run rc5des (see www.distributed.net for details, and
    I'm using the latest version), it will run fine, and keeps
    going for as long as I care to let it.
 4. Once I've run rc5des, I can't log in on any of the consoles
    or across my private network, I can't run any programs at
    all, nor can I get any response from any SysRq magic keys.
 5. If I stop rc5des with ^C it stops fine, but I still can't
    run anything else, nor can I restart rc5des after doing so.
My tests have indicated that whatever this problem is, it is VERY
SPECIFIC - rc5des does NOT cause this problem on any of the Intel
chips I've tried it on, nor on a friend's K6/166, nor on another
K6-2/350 I have access to that happens to be stepping 2.
I am therefore asking whether there are any known problems specific to
the K6-2/350 stepping 0 and (possibly) stepping 1 that this might be
tickling?
Best wishes from Riley.
