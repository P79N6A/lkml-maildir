That sounds promising :-)

Sorry, I don't know, but I can build it and check.
> One change that has happened in this region is that If your BIOS supports both speedstep-centrino and acpi-cpufreq, with 2.6.15 any one of those drivers would have worked. But now with 2.6.18, acpi-cpufreq will not work in the above case and you have to use speedstep_centrino. This was done because, speedstep-centrino has more features than acpi-cpufreq and also doing this helped to elimiate issues with lot of systems with kernel trying to do multiple ACPI PDC writes when BIOS doesn't expect it to.

Make sure you have properly configured speedstep-centrino (You should select X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI along with X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO).

Seems like 1 then. Will check the speedstep-centrino settings in the 
kernel. Thanks. I'll report back, but probably not until tomorrow.
