Hi list,
recently, I had changed my IDE disk from primary master to slave. I've got 
SUSE, Debian and Windows XP installed on it. I was ashamed to see that 
Windows loaded immediately, but the Linuxes didn't, because all of the 
filesystems were thought to be on /dev/hda. So I asked myself if there should 
not be device files that point to the _current_ hard disk (which should be 
defined at startup by the kernel) and its partitions. This way, it wouldn't 
matter which IDE channel a disk is connected to. What do you mean about this?
Please cc me!
cö,
Pascal Maillard
