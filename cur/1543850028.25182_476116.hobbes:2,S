The genirq changes broke boot on my x86-64 x366 machine. It needs
these two patches:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116157813623508&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116157837104613&w=2
It also broke tg3 on at least one other machine, so this is not
specific to my machine.
