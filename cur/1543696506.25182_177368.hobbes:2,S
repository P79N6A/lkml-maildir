Your code works on 2.4.22 and probably somewhat higher versions. However,
as I understand it, the new kernels no longer mmap everything by default.
In other words, there are no PTEs unless you or a driver sets them.
In user-mode, you need to mmap() and in kernel mode, you use ioremap_*().
Since you can mmap() something that is already mmapped() without any
problem, the code should probably be "fixed" to mmap everything it
tries to read, page-by-page.
If this is not correct, I'm sure somebody will respond.
Cheers,
