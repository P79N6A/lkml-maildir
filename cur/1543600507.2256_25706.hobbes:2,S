No - it would look through things like the free area
table, the buddy bitmaps, the page table & lists etc., all
of which are, of course, in kernel memory. So while
it may do unfortunate things to the cache, it doesn't
need to touch application memory in order to determine
which pages to twiddle with. Of course twiddling the
pages themselves requires access to them, but if they
are out on disk already they consume (or, if on
InactiveClean, could consume) no physical memory
so are the least of our problems w.r.t. memory
defragmentation.
