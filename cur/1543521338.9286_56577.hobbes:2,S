To hell with NT. There is a bunch of guys in NJ who did quite fine without
ioctl(2). And they got smaller interface - no magic numbers, no bloat, no
extra functions. I don't give a damn for NT - I've seen Cutler's code (in
RSX) and I have quite an opinion about his design abilities and taste, but
said opinion is completely unsuitable for family reading. But I have some
respect to _that_ bunch - you know, Thompson, Ritchie, Pike...
