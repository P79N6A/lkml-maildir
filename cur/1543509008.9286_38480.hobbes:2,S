Hi everyone,
I've patched both the kernel and the ppp(d) distribution to support in-kernel
packet filtering by the PPP driver. This allows you to restrict the packets
that pass over the link, or to prevent certain packets from resetting the idle
timer. The latter is useful if you rely on the idle option to bring your
link down, but don't want e.g. DNS queries or routing information to prevent
that from happening. See the pppd(8) man page for details, specifically, the
bits on the active-filter and pass-filter options.
This is an 'alpha' release -- it's not my intent for this to be included in
the official kernel or ppp(d) distributions (yet); I'd rather a few kind
souls tried it out first <g>
The patches and usage instructions are available from
