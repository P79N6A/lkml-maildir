Unfortunately, in my experience the included kernel driver doesn't work
reliable at all with my hardware either. I have tried all possible
kernel versions up to and including 2.4.23-pre5 without success.

The Highpoint proprietary drivers work fine in my case as well, but
I'm not too happy about the fact that I simply can't access the
SMART stats of my drivers at all for example.

I have tested the kernel hpt374 drivers with all possible kernel
configurations with and without ACPI/APM, local apic, io-apic and
they don't seem to change anything in my case. I just get the following
error message sooner or later and the whole system hangs.

It might be that my problems are somehow related to the motherboards
I've been using, as the first one is "Epox 8K9A3+ (Via KT400 chipset)"
while the another one is "Epox 4PCA3+ (Intel 875p chipset)". But they
are 100% reproduceble with multiple brands of disk-drives.
