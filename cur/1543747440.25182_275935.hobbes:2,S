in kernels -V0.7.30-9 or later they are RT-safe when PREEMPT_RT is
enabled.
also, the problem is that jackd uses _named_ fifos, which are tied to
the raw FS and might trigger journalling activities. Normal pipes
(unnamed fifos) would not cause such problems. Would it be possible to
change jackd to use a pair of pipes, instead of a fifo?

actually, my answer (sent on Nov 1) was:
