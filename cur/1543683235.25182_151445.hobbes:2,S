I thought that an optimisation for text size in 2.4 had been purposely
taken out of the 2.5 tree, because we expected GCC to do it
automatically by the time 2.6 was released?

For embedded systems, or anything completely solid state which doesn't
use a traditional spinning-disk-with-moving-heads, you could replace
it with a very simple one, and not loose much performance.

Try compiling out TCP/IP if your application doesn't need it.  A lot
of embedded systems don't.
