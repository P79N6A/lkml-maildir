Well, current private futex code still use global locks (one common hash table 
were all waited futexes are queued, private or shared)
'Only' mmap_sem and inode/mm refcounter inc/dec are avoided.
My proposal of having separate namespace was hold, in order to get the 
'private futexes' accepted in kernel.
So for the moment, I am not sure glibc should try to optimize CLEARTID operation.
