I like this. Lots.
Mostly because of this..
(16:14:11:davej@delerium:~)$ grep ^-# foo.diff  | wc -l
87
It's like someone revoked the drm folks preprocessor license 8-)

Looks ok, and pretty much matches similar conventions used in other
parts of the kernel.

One thing that would make things even nicer would be..
instead of this..

having a per-driver struct with regular C99 initialisers..
struct gamma_driver_fntbl {
	.preinit = gamma_driver_preinit,
	.pretakedown = gamma_driver_pretakedown,
	.dma_ready = gamma_driver_dma_ready,
	.dma_quiescent = gamma_driver_dma_quiescent,
	.dma_flush_block_and_flush = gamma_flush_block_and_flush,
	.dma_flush_unblock = gamma_flush_unblock,
};
Thanks for doing this work, it really is starting to look a little more
like a Linux driver 8-)
