Oh sorry, I think  we're misunderstanding eachother. /dev/mem is used
by lcrash.

It would kill lcrash support, but sure it would solve this specific
problem. However what happens if someone wants to share say some
texture ram between the kernel and a video card and that has to be
mapped uncached? Though up example here though.
