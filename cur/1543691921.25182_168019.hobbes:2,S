Oh, I agree.  The problem space changes and you have to move with it.  
I was just pointing out that by not learning from others you put yourself
at a disadvantage.  There are a lot of bright minds in the Linux space,

understood the past.  The past holds a lot of information, ignoring it
is a disadvantage.
