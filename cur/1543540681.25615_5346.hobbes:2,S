This is BS .. there is no law I know of that makes the US laws apply. In
fact as it sits we (Canada) are a fun loop hole in the US laws.  
We are exempt from the crypto export restrictions but have no restrictions
of our own.  The only thing they could do is try to go after the Americans
who contribute.
That is why the Canadian government itself was promoting crypto buisness
for a while. It's actually too bad the US is being forced to change it's
laws in this area... continued US stupidity in this area could actually be
quite proffitable for us.
The only laws that apply at all AFIK are intellectual property rights and
that won't be a problem after next month when the patents expire.

BS Why do you think openssh.com and other projects get hosted in
Canada? I'm sure if the US had their way they would all be shut down by
now.
