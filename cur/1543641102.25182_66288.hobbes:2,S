Hello,
I am running 2.4.18-3 version of the kernel on smp dual
processor and 1GB of RAM. My memory usage is increasing and
I can't find what exactly is eating memory. Top and proc
are reporting increases, but I would like to know of a
better way of tracing usage of memory and possible leak in
application(s).
Please reply to kacanski@yahoo.com
thanks                Sasha
