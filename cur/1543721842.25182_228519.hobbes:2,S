ahh, ooh, ow, of course.
Manfred, we need a separate list of "slabs which might need reaping".
That'll help the average case.  To help the worst case we should change
cache_reap() to only reap (say) ten caches from the head of the new list
and to then return.  Maybe increase the timer frequency too.
something like:
/*
 * FIFO list of caches (via kmem_cache_t.reap_list) which need consideration in
 * cache_reap().  Protected by cache_chain_sem.
 */
static LIST_HEAD(global_reap_list);
cache_reap()
{
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		if (list_empty(&global_reap_list))
			break;
		cachep = list_entry(&global_reap_list, kmem_cache_t, reap_list);
		list_del_init(&cachep->reap_list);
		<prune it>
	}
}
mark_cache_for_reaping(kmem_cach_t *cachep)
{
	if (list_empty(&cachep->reap_list)) {
		if (!down_trylock(&cache_chain_sem)) {
			list_add(&cachep->reap_list, &global_reap_list);
			up(&cache_chain_sem);
	}
}
Maybe cache_chain_sem should become a spinlock.
