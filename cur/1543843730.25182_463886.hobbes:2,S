But that's an entirely hypothetical benchmark. Mathieu was asked for
real-workload benchmarks and he gave you those. In turn, you set up
a simplistic test and then go on to conclude that the measurements
are far less than advertised. You ask that ltt replace its static
instrumentation by what kprobes provides and Mathieu demonstrated
that that's not realistic. If you want to change his mind, at least
reproduce the exact information ltt can provide and then we'll
talk.

But djprobe isn't even here yet. If you insist on keeping ltt's
_current_ limitations as your single most powerful justification to
reject it, how you hold kprobes to a different standard with a
straight face? You're only perpetuating the fallacy found
throughout this thread that somehow the shortcomings of dynamic
editing are "easy" to fix while those of static instrumentation are
inherently unrecoverable. That's just plain not true, as I've
demonstrated now countless times in this thread.
And please Ingo, I'm still waiting for your feedback on the static
markup mechanism I proposed earlier. I believe it avoids every
single problem you alluded to with regards to the problems generated
by inline markup.
Thanks,
Karim
