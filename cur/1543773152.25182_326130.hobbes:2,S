(implication of utf8 and not utf16 goes here)
Very few Unicode characters require three bytes, instead of the usual one or 
two.
For one byte you just have the byte. 
For two bytes, you really have three: a control code stating "the following 
two bytes are a two byte character", and then the two bytes. 
For three bytes, you really have four bytes: a control code stating "the 
following three bytes are a three byte character" and then the three bytes.
Unless I've completely misunderstood the Unicode specification, this is what 
is going on.

Any English characters (ie, the first 127 ascii characters) map directly to 
the first 127 Unicode characters (if thats what you meant).
