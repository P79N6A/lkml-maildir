This logic will certainly fix it, and I'm not against this logic to fix
the problem in a definitive way. It's only unfortunate PF_MEMDIE is smp
racy (plus having to check for PF_MEMDIE in the fast path).

I believe the thing you're hiding with the callback, is some screwup in
the VM. It shouldn't fire oom 300 times in a row.
zone->all_unreclaimable and zone->pages_scanned _must_ be set to 0 by
the oom_killer invocation, did you try to fix that?

the reason for oom in page_alloc.c, is that you must check the free
pages levels correctly, your previous nr_free_pages() attempt was the
unreliable way to do that (it couldn't take into account all the
lowmem_reserve levels etc..).

This approach of using a callback will sure work fine for that but the
300 times invocation of oom kill shows something is wrong in the VM, and
I believe the screwup is zone->all_unreclaimable and zone->pages_scanned
not being resetted by the oom killer invocation. I suspect if you fix
that single bit, things will start working even without the callback.
Note that in 2.4 only one task gets killed, and there's no need of any
callback in any fast path to make it work. I'm not conceptually against
the callback to "guarantee" oom-killing racing avoidance, but right now
it sounds like it's hiding some more fundamental problem in 2.6.
Thanks.
