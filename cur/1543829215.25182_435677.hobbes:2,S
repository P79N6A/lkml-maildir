Hi,
For anyone interested at 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/m68k/
 is my current 
patch queue for 2.6.18, one for current git and one for -mm.
Most of the patches are m68k specific and so shouldn't be a big problem.
Below are the patches which cause a conflict in -mm and where I'd 
aprreciate feedback the most.
One larger merge I finally like to get finished are the thread_info 
changes, most direct accesses to thread_info are gone by now, but a few 
sneaked back in:
- 0021-M68K-wrap-thread_info-access-in-mutex.txt
The mutex code is in a constant flux and the simplest fix is to do just do
s/\(\w*\)->thread_info/task_thread_info(\1)/ with kernel/mutex*c before 
the following patches are applied.
Ingo, could you please do this also in your tree/patches?
- 0023-M68K-Rename-thread_info.txt
- 0024-M68K-Rename-alloc-free-_thread_info.txt
There is only a minor conflict with pi-futex-rt-mutex-core.patch, so it's 
not really a problem.
The last part in the queue is a major cleanup of the m68k irq code, which 
gets it a lot closer to the generic irq code (although it's still a bit 
different) and results in a nice reduction of duplicated source. There is 
only one conflict here:
- 0031-M68K-convert-generic-irq-code-to-irq-controller.txt
This one conflicts with adjust-handle_irr_event-return-type.patch and I'm 
not sure about its status, especially since it's still without any 
response to the comments. Anyway, here I'd prefer to just drop the m68k 
specific part from it.
bye, Roman
