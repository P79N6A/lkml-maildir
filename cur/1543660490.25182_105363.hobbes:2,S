Hi
I am discussing with a few people on different approaches to solving a scale problem I am having, and have gotten vastly different views
In a nutshell, as far as this debate is concerned, I can say I am writing a web server.
Now, to cater to 700 clients, I can
a) launch 700 threads that each block on I/O to disk and to the client (in reading and writing on the socket)
OR
b) Write an asycnhrounous system with only 2 or three threads where I manage the connections and stack (via setcontext swapcontext etc), which is progromatically a little harder
Which way will yeild me better performance, considerng both approaches are implemented optimally?
Thanks
Lee
