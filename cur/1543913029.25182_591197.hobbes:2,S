I didn't say this - users can always suggest features.
But open source is driven by coders, not by dreamers who want to offload 
the work of implementing their whacky ideas to other people instead of 
getting their ass up and doing it themselves.
So if the user doesn't implement it himself, and no developer is 
interested in doing the work after it got posted to linux-kernel,
an idea is most likely not worth being tracked.
