Hello,
I'm sorry to bother you but this is the first time I've ever had a kernel 
compile error so I felt obligated to report it.  I have included the error 
below and attached a copt of my .config so you could see my options.  Thank 
you for your time.
scripts/split-include include/linux/autoconf.h include/config
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  
-DCPU=686 -march=i686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
init/main.c: In function `start_kernel':
init/main.c:490: `memory_start' undeclared (first use in this function)
init/main.c:490: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
init/main.c:490: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
