I ran into a couple of problems with the ACPI code in 2.3.14-1 (I don't
know if it was in previously)
1. the config lets you compile it APM in modular , although the
__setup(...) won't let it compile. I tried this with the PIIX4 stuff
turned on, didn't attempt a compile with it off
2. turning on PIIX4 ACPI broke my machine, turning off fixed
Normal bootup:
...
hda: IBM-DTTA-371010, ATA DISK drive
hdb: WDC AC32500H, ATA DISK drive
hdc: ASUS CD-S340, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: FX600S, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: IBM-DTTA-371010, 9641MB w/465kB Cache, CHS=1229/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: WDC AC32500H, 2441MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=620/128/63, DMA
Partition check:
 hda: hda1
 hdb: hdb1 hdb2 hdb3
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
(root is hdb1)
Failed bootup was same as before except the end
Partition check:
 hda: hda1
 hdb: hdb1 hdb2 hdb3
Found PIIX4 ACPI device at 4000
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:41
also I noticed, that the second (fuller) detail for both kernels were
missing my hdc and hdd drives, which are present in my 2.3.6 bootup.
<randomness> what is the state of vfat( on fat32) support in 2.3.14-1? Is
it safe for me to mount the drive? since it hasn't compiled for a while
I'm scared to try </randomness>
