Also, I think that we should strive for a setup where most of the dirty
buffer flushing is done through "page_launder()" instead of using
sync_buffers all that much at all. 
I'm convinced that the page LRU list is as least as good as, if not better
than, the dirty buffer timestamp stuff. And as we need to have the page
LRU for other reasons anyway, I'd like the long-range plan to be to get
rid of the buffer LRU completely. It wastes memory and increases
complexity for very little gain, I think.
