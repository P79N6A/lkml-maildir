Hi,
I have a Sony VAIO Z505JE with ymfpci sound and built-in microphone
and speaker. Everything worked fine with 2.2.17 plus ymfpci patch,
but the 2.2.18-pre22 produces a loud screech starting as sound
initializes and ending when startup scrips load mixer settings.
This happens because of audio loop between microphone and speakers.
I found that the culprit is the change to values of array
mixer_defaults[] in ac97_codec.c, that happened in 2.2.18-pre.
Currently I run the following patch:
--- linux-2.2.18-pre22/drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c	Sat Nov 18 19:04:34 2000
+++ linux-2.2.18-pre22-p3/drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c	Sun Nov 19 15:37:44 2000

I wonder if there is a better way?
In the interests of full disclosure let me mention that YMFxxx do have
internal loopbacks that may produce the same effect and that I checked
to the best of my ability that those loopbacks are muted. Therefore
I conclude that the loopback happens inside the AC97 (if such a thing
is possible).
