Hum, I thought I had at least compiled it :/. Next time I'll double-check!
The problem is, that sparc defines it in a little bit different way.
ip2 does this: <<EOF
#ifndef B153600
#       define B153600   0010005
#endif
#ifndef B307200
#       define B307200   0010006
#endif
#ifndef B921600
#       define B921600   0010007
#endif
EOF
and sparc termbits looks like this: <<EOF
/* This is what we can do with the Zilogs. */
#define  B76800   0x00001005
/* This is what we can do with the SAB82532. */
#define  B153600  0x00001006
#define  B307200  0x00001007
#define  B614400  0x00001008
#define  B921600  0x00001009
EOF
This diversity should be eliminated, I guess. What do char-folks think about 
this? Should we move this bits into asm-specific directories?
sorry,
