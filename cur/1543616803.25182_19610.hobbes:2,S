I'm annoyed that you take a comment in which I said that the Morton approach
was much preferrable to the preempt patch and respond by saying I "attack
any attempt to add realtime capabilities to the kernel". 
I'm all in favor of people trying all sorts of things. My original comment
was that the numbers I'd seen all favored the Morton patch and I still
haven't seen any evidence to the contrary.
I also made two very simple and specific comments:
	1) I don't see how processor specific caching, which seems
	essential for smp performance and will be more essential 
	with numa, works with this patch
	2) preempt seems to lead inescapably to priority inherit. If this
	is true, people better understand the ramifications now before they
	commit.
Of course, I think there are strong limits to what you can get for RT 
performance in the kernel - I think the RTLinux method is far superior.
Believe what you want - it won't change the numbers.
