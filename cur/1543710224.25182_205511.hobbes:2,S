I'm not talking about the 64 bits uid's and gid's. I'm talking about the
mapping system having to handle users' group memberships. Why would it
have to do that?

Yes. I know. This is not the problem i was trying to fix. This
discussion is going nowhere.
If I redesigned the way house doors worked, you'd be moaning about the
fact that the TV inside the house might be broken or stolen by someone
who enters the house. That's true. It might very well be. The only way
to secure it is to give your key to noone. The second you give you key
to someone else, you're basically fscked. And of course I know this is a
problem. It's a huge problem. I hope someone will fix it some day. It is
not, however, what I'm trying to do here.
