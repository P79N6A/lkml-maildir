You mentioned that if node 0 has a small ZONE_NORMAL and the ZONE_DMA for 
the system, defaulting to using ZONE_NORMAL on all nodes first would be a 
bad idea.  Is that really true?  Maybe for ZONE_DMA32 it is since that 
first node could have a few gigs of memory, but for regular ZONE_DMA it's 
probably the right thing to do...
So aside from the comment issues Lee already pointed out, I think 
Kamezawa-san's patch from 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=117758484122663&w=4
 seems reasonable.
