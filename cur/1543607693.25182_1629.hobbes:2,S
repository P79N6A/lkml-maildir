Thanks - that's a useful analysis.
The check in reparent_to_init() was to warn about the situation
where someone had deliberately set the exit signal to some
non-zero value and then the child calls reparent_to_init() - it's
telling you that we're about to stomp on your chosen exit signal.
I hadn't thought about the forget_original_parent() case.
So the fix should be to change the debug code in reparent_to_init()
so it doesn't complain if the exit signal is already SIGCHLD.  Or
just kill it off altogether.
