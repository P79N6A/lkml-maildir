Known bug. There is a fix for this in the 2.6.8.1-mm3 patch. You can 
download just the required patches to fix this problem by applying these 
two patches:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-mm3/broken-out/bio_uncopy_user-mem-leak.patch
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-mm3/broken-out/bio_uncopy_user-mem-leak-fix.patch
Always worth checking the recent linux-kernel archives before filing a 
report but don't let that stop you from filing a bug report.
Thanks,
