yes but if you cat  /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr, it returns in base 10.
While most of us have no problem doing an instant conversion, many
people will find it painful to convert the output of cat before copying
it into their .config.
I'm generally for hex, but here I'd prefer to stay with the in-place
format which is already decimal. And as you said, people can still
write the hex value into /proc/sys if they want to.
