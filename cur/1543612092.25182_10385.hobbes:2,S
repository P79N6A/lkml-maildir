The kernel will not do any printk debug output. The kernel
will boot silently. Only the output of userland processes will
make outputs to the console.
This patch is not for big systems like desktop or server. It is 
designed for systems with a very small footprint, like a toaster 
or a dvd player.
On this kind of systems the hardware normaly never change 
and there is not very much memory.
