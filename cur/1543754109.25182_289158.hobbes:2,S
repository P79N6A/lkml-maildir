It seemed to pass dbench runs OK, but then I started simultaneously
running dbench and nbench on two different disks (I have a new test
machine with more disks available). I am getting failures like this:
Jan 23 06:54:38 dev4-003 kernel: journal_bmap: journal block not found at offset 1036 on sdc1
Jan 23 06:54:38 dev4-003 kernel: Aborting journal on device sdc1.
Jan 23 13:19:43 dev4-003 kernel: journal_bmap: journal block not found at offset 1036 on sdd1
Jan 23 13:19:43 dev4-003 kernel: Aborting journal on device sdd1.
Jan 23 13:19:43 dev4-003 kernel: EXT3-fs error (device sdd1) in start_transaction: Readonly filesystem
The first failure was on the disk I am using for nbench (sdc). The
second is during a later run on the disk I am using the dbench
(sdd). I rebooted between the runs. It's interesting that its failing
at exactly the same offset both times. Is there anything magic about
offset 1036?
The new test machine is a 4 way PIII, with 4G ram, and 4 36G SCSI
disks. The test machine I have been using previously was a 2 way
(+hyperthreaded) Xeon.
I'll see if I can reproduce the problem with just dbench or just
nbench.
Cheers, Tridge
