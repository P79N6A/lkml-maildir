Yes, thats true. But for now from what I can see, one version should
be sufficient.

Yes, but scanning the entire payload for various types is also feasible. It is
a bit slow, but feasible and generally the recommended approach for
dealing with genetlink types. What you are saying is still possible, the
application can ignore types it does not understand.

Yes, thats true. We can leave the decision of compressing, etc to the
specific subsystem. It can encode it and the user level application
can decode the data.

Sorry for the confusion. Yes, even I would recommend creating a different
struct for the stats data. The data will pass over the same socket as delay
accounting (separate sockets can be used, but that would become inefficient).

Good suggestion, we can move the check to that point.
