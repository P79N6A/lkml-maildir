Subject: [PATCH] CONFIG_TOSHIBA Configure.help for 2.4.0-test11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed that for 2.4.0-test11 there is no help
for CONFIG_TOSHIBA, although there is for 2.2.17.
The following patch borrows the words for CONFIG_TOSHIBA
from the 2.2.17 Documentation/Configure.help, dropping
an extraneous "the" from the first line.
This patch applies to 2.4.0-test11.
