I think, 2 things should be accomplished here :
(1) be sure to pull the _highest_ prio task ;
i.e. the _highest_ prio task amongst all runnable (but not running) RT
tasks across all the run-queues which is capable of running on
this_cpu ;
(2) don't pull more than 1 task at once.
that said, just pull the highest prio task and run it.
---
why (2)? Just to avoid situations when tasks are being pulled/pushed
back and forth between run-queues.
Let's say we have 4 cpu system:
0:  task(10) , task(92)
1:  task(10), task(91)
2:  task(10), task(90)
3:  task(10)
when task(10) on cpu#3 is inactive, we pull task(92), task(91),
task(90) and then run task(90)... in the mean time, some of cpu[0..2]
becomes inactive and pull task(91) and task(92) back and run them...
that may repeat again and again depending on when/how long task(10)
run on their corresponding cpus...
so it seems to me that the more optimal behavior would be "don't pull
more than you can run at the moment -- that's 1".
to this goal, something like find_lock_highest_rq() would be necessary.
and I guess, {get,put}_task_struct() should be used in pull_rt_task()
for the 'next' in a similar way as it's done in push_rt_task() .
