It seems that way, yes.  I do not know how common the holdoffs are in real
life.  It would be interesting if there was a user report that switching
from reiserfs to ext2/ext3 actually made a difference - this would tell us
that it is indeed a real-world problem.
Note that this info because available because someone set
/proc/asound/*/*/xrun_debug.  We need more people doing that.
