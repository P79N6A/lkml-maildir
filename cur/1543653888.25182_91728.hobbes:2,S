If you link against qt 3.1 (and this will be common soon, KDE 3.1 
requires it), you can't change any of the options. There is a warning 
when it is running:
QObject::connect: No such signal ConfigList::menuSelected(struct menu*)
QObject::connect:  (sender name:   'unnamed')
QObject::connect:  (receiver name: 'unnamed')
QObject::connect: No such signal ConfigList::menuSelected(struct menu*)
