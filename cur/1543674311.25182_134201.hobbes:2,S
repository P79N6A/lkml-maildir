Well, this is a tender issue - both for users and non kernel developers
working on a project that may (according to the author at least *g*)
need kernel headers.
Getting something done sooner than later would thus be appreciated from
many venues, and will also get rid of your head aces =)
Trying to get back to my point ... I am sure there are many people
that will help getting this done, if only somebody with enough knowledge
of how the kernel devs want the ABI headers to look like will take some
kind of lead in the effort - i2c and sensor support in 2.5 is a good
example.
