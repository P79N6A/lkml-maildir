It seems difficult to seperate those two from each other. If the
subsystem you're relying on doesn't work, then ....

It could, but I think we're better off with the markers, yes.

"This djprobe is NOT a replacement of kprobes. Djprobe and kprobes
have complementary qualities. (ex: djprobe's overhead is low, and
kprobes can be inserted in anywhere.)". Hmm. that seems problematic.
 From what I was describing for function replacement, we could do an NMI
IPI to everyone, and lock them in there whilst we insert the probe, but
it's a bit sucky.

The hooking seems very similar, yes, perhaps I can be lazy and just
steal djprobes for this. The difference is that if we just replace the
whole function, we can just shove arbitrary changes into functions, and
do whatever we please. Plus we don't have to worry about locating
internal variables, etc.
