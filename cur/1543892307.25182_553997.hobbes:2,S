It is the functionality of "default y" that is not understood.
Take the following simple Kconfig file:
config FOO
	bool "FOO"
	default y
config BAR
	bool "BAR"
What would you expect when you execute "make oldconfig"?
You would expect to be questioned about both symbols and pressing enter
would give you the following config:
CONFIG_FOO=y
#CONFIG_BAR is not set
So "default y" in the oldconfig case where we add a symbol gives the
default value if you just press enter.
If you use "make menuconfig" and just enter menuconfig and exit and save
you will end up with exact same configuration as above because menuconfig
will select default values for all new symbols.
In other words "default y" has no impact on what oldconfig asks about,
only what value will be assigned if user decide not to change the value.
And this is exactly what it is supposed to do and no magic "do not ask user"
thing. That can be solved by having correct dependencies so if the
dependencies are not solved one will not be asked.
