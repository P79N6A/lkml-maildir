And you need the ConnectX-only masked atomics?  Or do the standard IB
atomic operations work for you?  Of course using atomics at all means
that things don't work on iWARP.

How does send with invalidate interact with the current IB FMR stuff?
Seems that you would run into trouble keeping the state of the FMR
straight if the remote side is invalidating them.
Also I would think that send-with-invalidate would be much more
expensive than the current FMR method of batching up the invalidates,
since you don't get to amortize the cost of syncing up all the internal
HCA state.
