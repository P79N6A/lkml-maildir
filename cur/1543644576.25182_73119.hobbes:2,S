There is no reason, why separate tests should be distributed normally.
But acoording to central limit theorem, distribution of the mean
converges to normal with increasing number of tests. So standart
deviation will tell to what precision we can trust the mean, that is to
compute the confidence interval.
We should have a bit more than 3 tests (first run can't be considered,
it has different starting conditions).  About 5 would do, 10 would be
perfect.
I would like to see the complete set of results anyway. There may be
some more interesting things to compute.
