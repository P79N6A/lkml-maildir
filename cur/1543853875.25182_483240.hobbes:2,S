The plan was to implement the x86 arch-specific percpu stuff to use it,
since it allows gcc better optimisation opportunities.

Hm, well, unfortunately for me, there is a small but distinct advantage
to using %fs rather than %gs (around 0-5ns per iteration).  The notable
exception being the "AMD-K6(tm) 3D+ Processor", where %gs is about 25%
(15ns) faster.
I'll revise the patches to use %fs and resubmit.
