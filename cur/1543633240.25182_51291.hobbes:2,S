try using hdparm to fix this, some distributions do a better
job than others setting up hardware, and udma6 being so new
it's not unlikely that your dist simply can't take this into 
account.  I use an asusa7v266-e and have had no harddrive controller
issues in ata-100, grab the latest hdparm, and the latest kernel (ensuring
it supports udma mode 6, and compile both.
