Hmmm, IPv4 it should (I'm working on IPv6 multicast support for olympic), remember token ring multicasts
go out using a function address, not the ip address, try the net-tools fix first, then let me know how

Oh, yes it can, you need to grab the latest version of net-tools, 1.53 doesn't know about the new
dev->type used for token ring.
