Hey,
I get a lock up with my wireless pcmcia cisco card. When i try to run to 
dhcpcd command or iwconfig it just hangs. Also when
i insert my card at boot time it hangs when running the net init 
scripts. I had this with version V0.7.8 and V0.7.10, have tested any 
other RT patches, i didn't have this problem with VP-T3. Also i can now 
mount and use my reiser4 partition.
