That's a nice idea, but in practice you also want efficient
execution of processes in the virtual machines and a virtual
host implementation that's flexible and easy to maintain.
As usual, you can't have everything so you'll have to make
choices here and there. The end result will be a useful
compromise between all the different ideas...
