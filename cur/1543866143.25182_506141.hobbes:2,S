umm, why?
A node which has CPUs and no memory is obviously physically possible and
isn't a completely insane thing for a user to do.  I'd have thought that
the kernel should be able to cleanly and clearly handle it, and to
accurately present the machine's topology to the user without us having to
go adding falsehoods like this?
