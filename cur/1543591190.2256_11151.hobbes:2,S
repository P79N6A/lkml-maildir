I meant physical not as in physical-vs-virtual addresses (all ISA 
addresses, memory or IO, are physical in this sense, by the time they 
get to the bus). Rather, I meant that you can't determine which slot 
a given device is plugged into. If you have two NICs in two ISA 
slots, there's no way to distinguish between the slots. In practice, 
you'd have to experiment or remove a card and check the jumpering or 
some such.
