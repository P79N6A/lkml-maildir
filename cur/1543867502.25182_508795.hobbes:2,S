not really; you missed that most of the ->'s are actually just going to
members of the union and aren't actually extra dereference.

so the next step, as mentioned in the changelog, to allocate only on the
first FPU fault, so that it becomes a GAIN for everyone, since only
threads that use FPU will use the memory.
The second gain (although only on old cpus) is that you only need to
allocate enough memory for your cpu, rather than 512 always.
