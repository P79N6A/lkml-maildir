Single-threaded qsbench is OK on 2.6.  Last time I looked it was a little
quicker than 2.4.  It's when you go to multiple qsbench instances that
everything goes to crap.
It's interesting to watch the `top' output during the run.  In 2.4 you see
three qsbench instances have consumed 0.1 seconds CPU and the fourth has
consumed 45 seconds and then exits.
In 2.6 all four processes consume CPU at the same rate.  Really, really
slowly.
