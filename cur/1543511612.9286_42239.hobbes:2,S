Hello All
  I have a prolem trying to aquire a new SCSI controller and I wanted to 
know if the following will work.
Adaptec Has a PowerDomain 39160  which is a mac only 160M scsi
controller (for 
only 555 dollars.) My question is Can I use this hardware in an Alpha or
Intel box
or is their a BIOS on the card that needs to be initialized???
Thanks For any Suggestions, Hints etc
Leslie Donaldson
