Yes, this part sucks.  There needs to be an easy library function that
takes a scsi command pointer, sets up a wait queue, adds the wait queue
struct pointer to the scsi command, sleeps with a timeout, wakes up when
command completes via scsi_done() or timeout fires, returns value based
upon how wake up happened.  Right now we don't have that, we only have a
little helper function, scsi_sleep(), for sleeping for a fixed length of 
time.
