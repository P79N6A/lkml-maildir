Ok, so then I'm not understanding things correctly.
Its not a locking correctness thing, but simply not being able to do it
from the vfs calls because those assume locks held?
Can't you simply punt the work to a worklet once you've created/removed
the non-default group, which can be done from within the vfs callback ?
