Careful.  I see code like this:
		stride = (1 << (PAGE_SHIFT - IO_TLB_SHIFT));
You probably don't want IO_TLB_SHIFT > PAGE_SHIFT...  Increasing
io_tlb_nslabs should be no problem though (subject to memory
availability).  It can already by set via the "swiotlb" option.
I doubt swiotlb is the right thing here, though, given the bw-demands
of graphics.  Too bad Nvidia cards don't support > 32 bit
addressability and Intel chipsets don't support I/O MMUs...
