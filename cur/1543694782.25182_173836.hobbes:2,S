    I've seen this, too. Try "sleep 1; echo -n standby > /sys/power/state".
    I theory I thought of, is that the system suspends before you have
    time to release the enter key, and the key release triggers a wakeup.
    Does this seem reasonable to those more knowledgeable?
That doesn't change anything for me, either.  Same 'dmesg' output as noted
before.

This is on a Sony VAIO R505EL, attached is 'lspci'.
