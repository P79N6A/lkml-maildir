They are optional, but if you want to do anything, you need to set them :)

Is this really needed?  If anyone calls them from non-process context,
they will get a nasty run-time warning, right?

They are reference counted.  Other portions of the kernel can grab them
and think they are safe to use.  If you do this with a static object,
what happens when the code goes away?
Most of the nasty race conditions that require this are now cleaned up
with Tejun's great sysfs work, so you will probably not see problems if
you do this, but in general, it's not a good thing to do.

heh.
I think your other questions are already answered, right?
