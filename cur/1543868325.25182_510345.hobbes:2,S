As a matter of fact, if IRQs has to be handled properly as resources of
their respective devices, I think request_irq replacement should take a
struct device...
In fact, having IRQs hanging off their respective devices would give a
proper way to access them via sysfs and implement the affinity etc...
thus providing a long term replacement for the current number based
APIs.
In addition, to facilitate the job of things like IRQ balancing daemons,
a /sys/irqs/ could be created containing symlinks to all irqs in the
system.
