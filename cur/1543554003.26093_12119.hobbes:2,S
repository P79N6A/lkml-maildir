This is a non fatal warning, not an error. However, newer "in-development"
gcc's have other issues making it refuse to build a full kernel image.
Either fix the makefile to use a compatible cc (egcs, kgcc for example),
define CC to make, or downgrade the default compiler to anything below or
including gcc-2.95.2
Whatever makes you sleep well at night.
