Yes, outgoing you know who sent it, the rule is checked in process
context.

No, it's indirect through the file (socket(2) returns a descriptor which
is a handle to a struct file *).  The file can be shared.

that's correct.

yes.

Yes.  Although consider fork/exec (so proc is different).

not really much different from comm match, right?  other than it's a
better match on the process?  i assume you look for a match then stop.
if the match is good, and the rule is allow...you have no idea who that
packet will be delievered to.  it's queued to the socket, and if more
than one process is waiting on that socket, you don't know which one
will be woken up.  so with this level of inaccuaracy, it's hard to say
you are buying security...

they are shared (i.e. another refcount on same structure).
