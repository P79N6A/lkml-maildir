Hi all,
I'm having a strange problem, of course not reproducible. Sometimes
after a suspend (to ram) and resume cycle, the kernel will try to free
all memory. This means, all running applications are flushed to swap (as
long as it is available), caches and buffers stay at around 15MB each.
The following video (traded quality for bandwidth) shows what happens on
the way from no swap to "swapon -a" (that's the unreadable thing in the
small shell): 
http://digadd.de/swapping.avi
The system:
Linux dnnote 2.6.22.5 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Aug 25 18:39:21 AST 2007 x86_64
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU T7400 @ 2.16GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
A 32bit Kernel is unable to suspend/resume at all. No idea why. dmesg
shows nothing, logs show nothing. Any ideas for debugging are welcome.
Regards,
Chris
