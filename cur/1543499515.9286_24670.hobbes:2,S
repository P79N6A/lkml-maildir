and this is what I experienced after an electrical failure.
this time, /dev/sda1 was the victim.
the system restarted fine; it e2fsck'd all filesystems and were clean; then
quotacheck started. at that time it started with messages like mentioned
before. this time, the logs are usable, sorry for the long lines here.

ok, I didn't panic (as the disk is removable and I have 2 backups) so I
restarted the system. now, the system wewnt into single user emergency mode
and I started e2fsck manually.
it spewed several duplicate/bad blocks.... asking if I wanted to clone it.
then stuff like this (several messages each, shown one only)
entry 'kernel' in ??? (65381) is a link to dir ??? (34302)
bad inode # for '.' in dir inode 69735
unconnected dir inode 55223 (???) .. in /lost+found/#120549/config/Motif.tmpl
is /usr/X/server (120800), should be /lost+found/#120549/config (33108)
inode ref count is  5, should be  6 
                   23, should be 20
                   54, should be 61
and also several instances of 'WARNING -- E2FSCK program bug (or bonehead
(me) tries to check live FS' (the filesystem was NOT mounted)
inode.link_info[32705]=0, inode.i_links_count=65532. should be the same 
/dev/sda2 was also affected but the backup blocks helped here.
I know that some messages might be slightly off the real world due to the
fact that I had all other filesystems needed mounted r/o.
I also experienced one time, during the check an uncommanded reboot.
Like Harald, I'll revert to 2.2.5 or 2.2.7 and see if that keeps the
stability OK.
I hope it helps.
Roeland (now, lets reconstruct the data)
