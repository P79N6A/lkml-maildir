You need a shaper connected to the ISP backbone which shapes the
outgoing traffic for you and a border router which talks to the T1
(C17xx or C26xx). Normally, if your ISP has some sort of clue, you
will also need a bastion router which can handle backbone <-> 100 MBit
traffic and does dynamic routing updates (EGP or OSPF) to the ISP
backbone (A C26xx or C37xx).
This isn't your run-of-the-mill setup but I know of plenty ISPs here
that will happily sell you this and also the consulting needed to
plan, setup and operate the link. However, you won't get it for
$199/month. :-)
