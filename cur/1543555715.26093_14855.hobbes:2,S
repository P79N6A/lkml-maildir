However, now rather than just reading the dump as you can with ksymoops
or whatever, you have to look at the raw data and try to match it up with
a symbol in the list.
So, with that ARM dump I gave you, we'd potentially end up with about 100
lines of symbols, where about 90 of them are useless.  That would be a
backwards step in the development of Linux IMHO.
PS, you're not going to convince me unless you can come up with something
that produces ksymoops-like output, so there's no point continuing.
