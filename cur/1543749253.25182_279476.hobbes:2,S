Hi,
  I try to use netconsole to keep Linux kernel oops to
another machine. I've compiled netconsole into the
kernel (i.e. select CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y, when run
'make menuconfig'). 
  After that, I put
"netconsole=@/,514@192.168.0.1/00:02:3F:03:D2:59"
(which is described in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt)
to the kernel command line as provided by grub and
rerun my machine with the new compiled kernel.
  But then, when the system is booting, it shows the
following message:
... ...
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
audit(1103234064.4294965842:0): initialized
netconsole: eth0 doesn't exist, aborting.
... ...
  Then, What's the matter with the build-in
netconsole? Have I misconfiged the netconsole? and How
to really run build-in netconsole?
  Thank you.

Best Regards,
Park Lee
