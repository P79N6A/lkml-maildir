I see.  That makes a lot of sense.

So what we want is something more like:
struct softnet_data softnet_data __per_cpu_data = { NULL };
static void void net_tx_action(void *arg)
{
	struct softnet_data *data = arg;
	if (arg->completion_queue) {
	...
}
	open_softirq(NET_TX_SOFTIRQ, net_tx_action, softnet_data);
and have kernel/softirq.c do:
                do {
                        if (pending & 1)
                                h->action(this_cpu(h->data));
                        h++;
                        pending >>= 1;
                } while (pending);
right?
