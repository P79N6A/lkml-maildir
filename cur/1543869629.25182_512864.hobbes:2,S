qgit is a git repository GUI browser. This is mostly a bug fix release.
Due to a change in git-rev-list output in git version 1.5 and above in
case of commit encoding information old version of qgit are no more
compatible and big issues in revision list view are possible under
some circumstances.
So an upgrade to this release is strongly suggested for all the users
of new version of git (1.5 and above).
Download tarball from 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qgit

P.S: There is also a Qt4 version (works under Windows) downloadable
from git://repo.or.cz/qgit4.git  it is a little bit experimental
tough.
