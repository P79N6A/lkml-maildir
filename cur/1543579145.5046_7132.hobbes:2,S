Yeah, I agree, 'file/stream' is lousy syntax as well.  If it weren't
for the possibility of having streams on directories, it would almost
be acceptible.  I still don't know which (':' or '/') is the worse
hack.
As I've said elsewhere in this thread, I can't think of *any* clean way
to shoehorn forks into nice, transparent posix calls.  It really wants
a new API.
