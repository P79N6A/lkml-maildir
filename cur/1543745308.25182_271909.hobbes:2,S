I might merge up a DRM with the 3D part disabled, so the 2D stuff
works after 2.6.10 comes out, Alan wanted me to merge up all the
outstanding drms that have security issues and disable them for
non-root but someone pointed out the issues with making people run
untrusted things as root to be able to use them at all...
