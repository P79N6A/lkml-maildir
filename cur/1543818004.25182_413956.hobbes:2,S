Please try this with an allyesconfig build a enjoy the result.
There is a huge effort involded before getting remotely warning free in
this area.
Your approch seems to neglect the fact that the linker may rearrange
functions if it decide to do so.
And on X86_64 we actually do so with CONFIG_REORDER.
Someone on the list will probarly have som inputs how to do what you try
in a more protable way.
