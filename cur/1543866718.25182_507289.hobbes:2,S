There is something connected, I believe what's actually there on this 
board on that port is the SiI4723 chip which is connected to two other 
SATA ports. For whatever reason it gets detected as a drive, and it also 
seems to be not responding until we do a few resets..

My advice on recent kernels is just set CONFIG_IDE=n and enable 
PATA_JMICRON if you want JMicron support, unless you really want to use 
the crusty old IDE layer..
