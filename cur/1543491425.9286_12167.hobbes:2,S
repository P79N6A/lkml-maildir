This shows that you can open 1021 sockets on my machine. Since 3
fds are already open, the default limitation seems to be 1024 as
expected.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
main()
{
    int s;
    for(s = 0;; s++)
       if(socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0) <0) break;
    printf("%d\n", s);
}
