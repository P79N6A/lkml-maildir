I'll fail miserably :-)

You need to actually boot the kernel to get effective reports from

Preferably, the subject might convey what you are doing, but the full
description should at least add to that by telling _why_ you are doing
that.

device::sem -> device::mutex, and 12/12 changes a user of it.
