OK I wasn't aware it was explicit in 2.4 and earlier.
Two upsides I see to explicit: firstly, it works on non-empty queues. Less
of a problem perhaps, but only because it is statistically less likely to
be the next submitted, so there will still be some improvement.
Second, for async work (aio, readahead, writeback, writeout for page reclaim),
the point where you wait is probably not the best place to unplug.
Also, it would allow lock_page to be untangled.
