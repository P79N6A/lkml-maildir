Hello guys,
I would like to know how to modify or tourn around the mount counter used by
mount command to
start an automatic file system check.
When mounting a file system during system bootstart, I got from time to time a
message
saying the file system has reached count value and will be checked.
That's sounds good for a system used as a server, but for a laptop used for
demonstrations
it is quite hard to have to wait for several minutes with the customer in front
of me
waiting for a complete file system check, avoiding remarks like:
"Oh, Linux is so sure about the stored data that it needs to check it from time
to
time"
or worst:
"That feature is not need by Window$. They check (are you crazy) the file
system only when booting after a power failure."
Rather of that, I would like to suppress this check or carry out the recommended
file
system check off once the demo completed.
Thanks for your help
