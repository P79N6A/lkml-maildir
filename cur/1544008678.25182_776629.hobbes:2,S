Subject: [PATCH] x86: Change thread_info's flag field back to 32 bits
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/3/500

Change x86_64's thread_info 'flags' field back to __u32.
This was changed to 'unsigned long' when the thread_info*.h
for i386 and x86_64 were merged.  Change it back.  We can
do this as only 27 bits of 'flags' are actually used.
This change actually packs down thread_info by 64 bits:
32 bits are saved by the smaller flags, and 32 bits are
saved by the following 'mm_segment_t field' becoming
naturally 64-bit aligned.
