Hi, I need to check for *only* Intel P6 processors, so no Classic Pentium,
and no Pentium 4. setup.c is a bit obscure; is this check correct :
if (current_cpu_data.x86_vendor != X86_VENDOR_INTEL ||
	current_cpu_data.x86 != 6)
	return NOT_P6;
if (current_cpu_data.x86_model > 5)
	return PENTIUM_III;
if (current_cpu_data.x86_model > 2)
	return PENTIUM_II;
return PENTIUM_PRO;
??
(I need this check as I make use of the P6 performance counters).
Also, I found a weird bit of code in setup.c (2.4.0test12) :
1567   case 4:
1568       if ( c->x86 > 6 && dl ) {
1569            /* P4 family */
1570            if ( dl ) {
1571                    /* L3 cache */
1572                    cs = 128 << (dl-1);
1573                    l3 += cs;
1574                    break;
1575            }
1576       }
1577       /* else same as 8 - fall through */
1578   case 8:
1579       if ( dl ) {
in particular, the check on line 1570 seems redundant, or a typo.
thanks
john
