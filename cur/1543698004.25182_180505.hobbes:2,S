At least since kernel 2.6-test8, I thin,k ACPI works with my Abit 
nforce2 mobo. Before it crapped out.

Intersting. My Windows locks up, as written in the other post, though 
this seldomly occurs. Sometimes the system runs for days (using s3 and 
s4). Then it could lock-up within minutes after boot-up.
kernel26 though locks up pretty fast when apic is enbled.
What kind of SATA Adapter hat the Asus? I have a Silicon image Si3112A. 
Maybe this is the root of all evil. ItÄs driver sucks hard, as doing a 
hdparm -d1 /dev/hde craps my drive up. (Though hdparm claims the drive 
is already running in DMA mode.)
What kind of SATA controller do the Epox users have? Or don't they have 
SATA onbaord?
I know that SiI Image produced corruption with early bioses, so maybe 
this really is the weak spot.
