Just to add my $0.02 on this point : this could also be one of the problem
I'm facing on my machine right now, but the point is that Windows supports
it perfectly. At least that proves it can work, and it does work.

So, as far as I'm concerned, that sounds legal... Also, running old Linux IDE
code is no problem with a bus that only has a slave...
Regards,
Paul
