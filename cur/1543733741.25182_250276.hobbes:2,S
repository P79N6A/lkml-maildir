This, along with other information from XFS bugzilla and the xfs list
etc. etc. seems to suggest that there is a common trend:
SMP systems on 2.6 have a problem with XFS+NFS.
UP systems on 2.4 and possibly 2.6 does not have this problem.
We'll be testing with a 2.6.8.1 UP kernel, next time the big server
reboots (it's been up for the better part of a day now so it shouldn't
take long ;)
