You seem to want a uniq id in 'per device' which will identify the
'volume'.
That doesn't make sense to me so maybe I am missing something.
If you want to identify the 'volume', you put some sort of id in the
'per-volume' data structure.
This is what the 'name' field is for.

Put your 64 bit WWN in the 'name' field, and teach user-space to match
'name' to FC adapter.
Does that work for you?
