I was thinking about changing it globally to do what its name suggest.
Main problem is that before introducing skipping Promises, FORCE
controlled overriding BIOS only (?) and now it is also used to control
'skipping'. (FORCE should be by default on of course)
Probably 'skipping' should be separated to another config option...
And second problem is that 20265 is used as primary onboard
sometimes and sometimes as offboard (another config option?).
