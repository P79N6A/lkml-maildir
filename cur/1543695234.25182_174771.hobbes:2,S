FWIW, it's easy to go back and forth as well, bash (pure sh?) functions
to do it:
REVTOKEY() {
	if [ -z "$1" ]; then
		echo "Usage: REVTOKEY revision-number"
	else
		if [ ! -f ChangeSet -a ! -f SCCS/s.ChangeSet ]; then
			echo "Must be run from the base of a BitKeeper repositor
y"
		else
			echo -n "The key is: "
			bk prs -r$1 -hnd:KEY: ChangeSet
		fi
	fi
}
KEYTOREV() {
	if [ -z "$1" ]; then
		echo "Usage: KEYTOREV key"
	else
		if [ ! -f ChangeSet -a ! -f SCCS/s.ChangeSet ]; then
			echo "Must be run from the base of a BitKeeper repositor
y"
		else
			echo -n "The key is: "
			bk prs -r$1 -hnd:REV: ChangeSet
		fi
	fi
}
