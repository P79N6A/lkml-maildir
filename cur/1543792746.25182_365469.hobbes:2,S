Yes, I think I'm noticing an uptick in patches as soon as a kernel is
released.
It's a bit irritating, and is unexpected (here, at least).  I guess people
like to hold onto their work for as long as possible so when they release
it, it's in the best possible shape.
I guess all we can do is to encourage people to merge up when it's working,
not when it's time to merge it into mainline.
One could just say "if I don't have it by the time 2.6.n is released, it
goes into 2.6.n+2", but that's probably getting outside the realm of
practicality.
