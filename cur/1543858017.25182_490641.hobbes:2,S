Hi Trond,
 unfortunatelly I have no controll over the mounting maps, as they are
maintained from different people. So the answer is no. Unfortunatelly
the customer has decided on using am-utils. This has been hurting us
(and them) for years ...
 Your are likely correct when you hint towards partitions which are
frequently remounted.  
 In any case, your help is appreciated.
Cheers
Martin
