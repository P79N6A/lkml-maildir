Subject: Coding style RFC: convert "for (i=0;i<ARRAY_SIZE(array);i++)" to "array_for_each(index, array)"

Now that most of the sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0])
conversions have been done (there are about 800 done
and about another 130 left), perhaps it could be
useful to change the code to use a define similar
to the list_for_each
#define list_for_each(pos, head) \
	for (pos = (head)->next; prefetch(pos->next), pos != (head); \
        	pos = pos->next)
perhaps
#define array_for_each(index, array) \
	for ((index) = 0; (index) < ARRAY_SIZE((array)); (index)++)
