I have a user-space batch job scheduler that could use fork_connector
to track which processes belong to a job.  It looks perfect for what I
need.
I would also like to see a do_exit hook, but only as a convenience. I
can probably scrape the BSD accounting files in lieu of a do_exit
hook, but if I had one, I wouldn't need to touch disk for my job
accounting.
