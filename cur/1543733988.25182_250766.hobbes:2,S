no, and in fact outgoing there's no question who's sending the packet,
as it's still in process context.

Depends on where the hooks are registered into netfilter whether you'll
get the inbound stuff.  I'm assuming this part is ok.  Point is, the act
of receiving a packet and queueing data to a socket does not happen in
process context.  So you don't know who will be woken up to actually
read data from that socket.  Your stuff should work for most cases.  But
it's not fundamentally deterministic enough to call it really secure.
