Linux requires blocksize <= PAGE_SIZE, so basically all filesystems
use blocksize <= 4096 unless they implement support internally for
reading/writing partial disk blocks from the page or buffer cache.
With ext2/3 it is possible to change the number of inodes allocated
without changing the blocksize (less inodes per block group).  If you
care about mounting under Linux it might be worthwhile seeing if UFS
can do the same.

This is it exactly.

It seems unlikely (though not impossible, I haven't checked the UFS
code) than it is possible to mount your filesystem without serious
hacking to the filesystem/VFS/VM, unless of course you are mounting
on an ia64 machine (or similar) with 64kB PAGE_SIZE.  Sadly, x86_64
does not support a larger PAGE_SIZE than 4096 (until you get to 4MB
or something like that).
Cheers, Andreas
