A while back, while we (myself and Andrew De Quincey) were struggling
with new DVB frontend devices that needed math operations to be
performed in the frontends themselves for frequency tracking / locking
etc, we found that eventually userspace was a much better place to have
such code, rather than being in kernel.
After quite some thoughts we found it would be much better to have them
implemented in userspace. We did finally draw up to some conclusions,
eventually.
We came up with some code eventually, but time was limited on our hands
that we went into discussion of the newer delivery systems that came
along, so development was a bit halted in that aspect.

Being a bit excited and it is really interesting to have such a
proposal, it would simplify the matters that held us up even more,
probably. The name sounds fine though. All i was wondering whether there
would be any high latencies for the same using in such a context. But
since the transfers would occur in any way, even with a kernel mode
driver, i think it should be pretty much fine.
