So basically you meant that you have a buffer-leakage. Could you press
SYSRQ+M and show me the state of the buffers?
Maybe you may want to give a try also to this my two other patches:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/no-swapout-2.2.10-B
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A
they should to be applyed at the same time.
If the above patches won't make difference it means somebody forget to
release some buffer or something similar.
If you can reproduce on x86 then you can debug the thing with the ikd
patch.
