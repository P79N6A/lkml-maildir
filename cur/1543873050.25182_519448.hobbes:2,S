ok. So nice levels had nothing to do with it - it's some other 
regression somewhere. How does the vanilla scheduler cope with the 
exactly same workload? I.e. could you describe the 'delta' difference in 
behavior - because the delta is what we are interested in mostly, the 
'absolute' behavior alone is not sufficient. Something like:
 - on scheduler foo, under this workload, the CPU hogs steal 70% CPU 
   time and the resulting desktop experience is 'choppy': mouse pointer 
   is laggy and audio skips.
 - on scheduler bar, under this workload, the CPU hogs are at 40% 
   CPU time and the desktop experience is smooth.
things like that - we really need to be able to see the delta.

likewise, how does the RSDL kernel build behavior compare to the vanilla 
scheduler's behavior? (what happens in one that doesnt happen in the 
other, etc.)
