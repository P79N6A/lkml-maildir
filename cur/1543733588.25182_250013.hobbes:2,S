How many active VGA devices can I have in this system 1 or 4? If the
answer is 4, how do I independently address each VGA card? If the
answer is one, you can see why I want a pci0000 node to hold the
attribute for turning it off and on.
How many simultaneous VGA devices does this system allow?
ppc32:
jbarnes@mill:~$ ls -l /sys/devices
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 pci0000:00/
drwxr-xr-x  13 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 pci0001:01/
drwxr-xr-x   7 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 pci0002:06/
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 platform/
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 system/
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root 0 Sep  4 13:37 uni-n-i2c/
I would think it is three active devices.
Does a PCI domain imply separate PCI IO address spaces, or does it
just mean separate PCI Config spaces?
Can an x86 machine use separate PCI IO address spaces?
