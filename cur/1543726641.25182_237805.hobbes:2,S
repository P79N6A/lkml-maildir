Yes, we would very much like to contribute OpenSSI to the main kernel.
However, we aren't quite ready to do that.  For the last couple of years
we have getting the functionality and stability on the 2.4 base.  We are
now ready to first get it working on 2.6 and then clean up the code for
submission either to a 2.6 base or a 2.7 base.
