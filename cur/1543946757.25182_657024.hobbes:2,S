Yes, my point ;). "block2mtd" creates a "mtd" out of a block
device and "mtdchar" and "mtdblock" create the "char" and
"block" devices out of the "mtd". This is a different concept
from "loop". With "loop", you make a block device out of a file,
but you do the ioctl on the target loop block device itself.
With block2mtd, you can't do that.

Actually, that's what I use block2mtd for, in combination with
"loop" to mount jffs2 filesystem images (always wondered if
there wasn't a simpler way, BTW (other than mtdram))
