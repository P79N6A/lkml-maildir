It's up to Linus and Andrew I guess. I don't see why not, but I
don't much care one way or the other. But thanks having a quick
look at it, we may want it for the Suse kernel.

But making PG_lock a spinning lock is completely unrelated to the
bug at hand.

It is the correct target. I know all about your set_page_dirty_lock
problems, but they aren't what I'm trying to fix.
AFAIKS, you could also make set_page_dirty_lock non sleeping quite
easily by making inode slabs RCU freed.
What places want to use set_page_dirty_lock without sleeping?
The only place in drivers/ apart from sg/st that SetPageDirty are
rd.c and via_dmablit.c, both of which look OK, if a bit crufty.
