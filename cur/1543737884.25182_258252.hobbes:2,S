Hi Grant,
Well, I am confused then.
Originally, we needed to use pci_root_ops in io_init.c to pass it to
pci_scan_bus().  But pci_root_ops is defined as a static in pci/pci.c.  We took
out the static so that we can use this in io_init.c.  However, it sounded like
you guys do not want to externalize pci_root_ops.  Okay, we created
sn_pci_root_ops.
We do not want pci_raw_ops to point at anything different.  It is exactly what we
needed now that we have implemented in our Prom all the pci config read/write SAL
calls.

In the routine sn_pci_fixup_bus()
+static void sn_pci_fixup_bus(int segment, int busnum)
+{
+       int status = 0;
+       int nasid, cnode;
+       struct pci_bus *bus;
+       struct pci_controller *controller;
+       struct pcibus_bussoft *prom_bussoft_ptr;
+       struct hubdev_info *hubdev_info;
+       void *provider_soft;
+
+       status =
+           sal_get_pcibus_info((u64) segment, (u64) busnum,
+                               (u64) ia64_tpa(&prom_bussoft_ptr));
+       if (status > 0) {
+               return;         /* bus # does not exist */
+       }
+
+       prom_bussoft_ptr = __va(prom_bussoft_ptr);
+       controller = sn_alloc_pci_sysdata();
+       if (!controller) {
+               BUG();
+       }
+
+       bus = pci_scan_bus(busnum, &sn_pci_root_ops, controller);
+       if (bus == NULL) {
+               return;         /* error, or bus already scanned */
+       }
We bail if sal_get_pcibus_info() is not successful.  Am I missing something?
