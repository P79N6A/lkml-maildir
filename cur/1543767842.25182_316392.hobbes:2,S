Not quite. The _perceived_ difference e.g. between unaccelerated fbdev
and mga driver is dramatic when you scroll around much in your windows
(of eclipse, mozilla...) even on 3 GHz CPUs. (I know very well since I
had to live with fbdev on a G550 for some time...)
And for video acceleration, there's always the point where it makes
the difference between stuttering and no stuttering.
I won't use any non-accelerated basic X11 and non-accelerated Xv any
more, no matter how fast the CPUs get. (The fact that it was always
worse n years ago for bigger n doesn't count...)

PS. The most important feature of any graphics card for me? No fan.
