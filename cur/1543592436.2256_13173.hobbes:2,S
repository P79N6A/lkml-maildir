It isn't an immediate priority for me at this moment, but in a few weeks I
hope to have it back at the top of my concerns.  If anyone considers it
truely important, I might be persuaded to give it a bit more nudging
along, but if people try to explain to me that the concept is completely
unnescessary, I'll redirect their notes to /dev/null.
