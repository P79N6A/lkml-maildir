They can. Look at Solaris install CDs.

Linux cannot use them, AFAIK.
It would be a good idea to support them, but it would require choosing a
different major number and different minor numbering strategy for them.
The problem is that limiting number of CDs to e.g. 16 is not possible due to
changers where you can have hundreds of CDs attached to one machine.
