Can you elaborate a bit?  I don't really think completing a command
after 30sec timeout contributes a lot to driver stability.

Yeah, that would be the best.  The problem is that there are several
different kinds of timeouts and we don't know which controller locks up
after which timeout and investigating them is really difficult.
IMHO, losing media error information is much better than locking up a
machine hard.  We can start white listing known good controllers but I'm
skeptical how much benefit it will bring.
Thanks.
