You only have one single SCSI adapter?
I tried several things so far, and it seems you need the following to 
trigger the problem: You need at least two SCSI adapters that require 
different drivers (so two AHA2940s are not sufficient) and the drivers 
need to be loaded as modules.
                                                                  -o)
