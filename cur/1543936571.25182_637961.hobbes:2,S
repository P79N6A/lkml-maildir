Yes, I certainly like this concept. What I would have wanted in that patch,
though, is that the read-only data would right away be included in
RODATA() rather than being put in DATA_DATA. Also, to shorten the
names a little, how about .{cpu,mem,dev}init.rodata?
The one thing that I'm not sure is really consistent yet wrt. the
constification is that now you need to write e.g.
static const char __cpuinitcdata example[];
and (accidentally) omitting the 'const' (as it's really an apparently
redundant thing now) as in
static char __cpuinitcdata example[];
will cause section type conflicts (at the compiler or linker level). I
therefore think that the 'const' should really be part of the
__{cpu,mem,dev}cdata definitions (requiring the attribute to be
placed properly, namely placement at the end of a declaration as
is possible with __{cpu,mem,dev}initdata is then not an option here).
