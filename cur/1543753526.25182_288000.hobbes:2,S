which shows that you dont know the exec-shield patch at all, nor those
split-out portions. At which point it becomes pretty pointless to 
discuss any technical details, dont you think?

here there are two misconceptions:
1) you claim that the manual setting of markings is better than the
_automatic_ setting of markings in Fedora. Manual setting is a support
and maintainance nightmare, there can be false positives and false
negatives as well. Also, manual setting of markings assumes code review
or 'does this application break' type of feedback - neither is as
reliable as automatic detection done by the compiler.
2) you claim that you have to audit everything. You dont have to. It's
all automatic. _Fedora developers_ (not you) then check the markings and
reduce the number of executable stacks as much as possible.

another misconception. Read the patch and you'll see how it's solved.

this is your choice, and i respect it. Please show the same amount of
respect for the choice of others as well, without badmouthing anything
just because their choice is different from yours.
