We do not cache it. We use this pgrp as an argument for find_pid()
right after return from parse_options(). And find_pid() uses
current->nsproxy->pid_ns. That is why this is bugfix.

Of course it is ugly to store pid_t and then call find_pid(),
I don't understand why the code was written this way. But I
am not going to cleanup this code ;)
(note also that the 2nd patch I sent for autofs4 does not use
 pid_t at all).

But it is not possible to pass the global pid_t from within
the subnamespace via "pgrp=" option, automount (or whatever)
just can't know it when it runs in the subnamespace.

perharps, I don't know...
But this is imho a bit off-topic, we can change the debugging
output later any way we like.
