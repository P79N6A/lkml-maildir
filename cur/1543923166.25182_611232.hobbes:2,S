Not in any meaningful way.

What SuSv3 actually says is:
	If the system detects that sleeping until a locked region is
	unlocked would cause a deadlock, fcntl() shall fail with an
	[EDEADLK] error.
It doesn't require the system to detect it, only mandate what to return
if it does detect it.

I've never heard of one that does.

You can't fix the false EDEADLK detection without solving the halting
problem.  Best of luck with that.
