the idea is multi-pronged:
 - Primarily, we want to fix the regression. 2.6.20 worked, 2.6.21 
   didnt, that has to be fixed, no matter what - end of story. But we've 
   got a wide selection of patches for that purpose now, so what matters 
   at this point is the secondary question:
 - we want to know _why exactly_ the hang happens. We now have a pretty 
   good theory: hw-resend hangs the IO-APIC. (there is a delicate dance
   between local APICs and IO-APICs for level-triggered irqs, and if we
   interject via hw-resending via the local APIC, existing races, hw
   bugs or weaknesses in our hw-resend implementation might be exposed)
and even though we now have a wide selection of patches we really want 
to get to the bottom of the problem so that we can fix the bug that got 
exposed: apparently hw resend doesnt always work with level-triggered 
irqs.
Note that the hw-resend sequence can trigger _even without our original 
patch that triggered the regression_, it's just much less likely to 
happen, so this is a pre-existing IO-APIC/APIC code bug that could 
trigger anytime, and which we want to see fixed.
To confirm this theory - does the debug-patch below fix the hang? If it 
fixes the hang then the theory is confirmed and then the right solution 
is to retrigger an IRQ for level-triggered irqs with the proper 
trigger-type set.
