[... cc's trimmed, I guess everyone is on the list... ]
I also would like to speed up boots.  On the systems I'm 
responsible for (set top boxes hooked up to television 
sets) the slowest part of the boot is mounting the five reiser 
filesystems.  I'm using the busybox init and the "boot scripts" 
are actually a single compiled program.
Could mounting filesystems be parallelized effectively?
Three of the five filesystems on are mounted read-only, so I 
don't know what reiserfs is doing at mount that takes so long.
It used to be faster when we were using 2.2.19 with the reiser
3.5 patches...  
Does ext3 mount faster?
