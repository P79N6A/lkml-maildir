I am not accessing the AGP bus as my frame buffer is located on the PCI
bus.
00:08.0 Multimedia video controller: Unknown device f1d0:efac
	Subsystem: Unknown device f1d0:efac
	Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 10
	Memory at f4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
	Memory at f6000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=16M]
(I am working with the second memory address)
Any recommendations on where to start hacking?  Would it be a good idea
to add O_DIRECT to a mmaped PCI space?  The kernel should not be doing
any buffering whatsoever, as we will be coming close to filling the pci
bus up with transfers from direct disk->fb already.  (We are already
doing buffering on the FB card as well)
