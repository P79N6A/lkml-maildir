We've always supported runtime states. There is just no drivers which

ACPI S2 is irrelevant. Nonetheless, you're suggesting that we add manual 
checks at runtime for each device to determine what state to go into, 
depending on whether the system is entering suspend-to-disk or suspend-to-
ram. 
That's a bad idea because:
- It doesn't need to be done at runtime, only initialization. Though it's 
  not a permformant path, it's still more efficient to do it once only. 
- It forces policy into the drivers, instead of having them specify a 
  changeable default. 
- It can only be changed by editing and recompiling the driver, unless 
  they manually export the variable.

No, read the first email on this subject. You can have the bus do it for 
all devices of a certain type (e.g. IDE), or you can have the drivers do 
it when they're bound to specific devices.
