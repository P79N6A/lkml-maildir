What would happen if the thread wasn't stopped?  Is it just that the
numbers would be inaccurate, or is there some kind of security
exposure?
If it's just that the numbers would be inaccurate, then I don't think
the kernel needs to enforce it.  The monitoring program *should*
ensure that the thread is stopped or blocked, one way or another, but
it could do that simply by sending a SIGSTOP to the thread.  I don't
see that it would necessarily have to use ptrace.
Paul.
