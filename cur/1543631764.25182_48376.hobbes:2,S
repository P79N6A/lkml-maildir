My first problem is that this is a partial sampling of the source base.
My second problem is that Paolo Mantegazza isn't the original author of
that file.

Well, I find it misleading.  It makes it sound like you have rights to that
code that you don't and it makes it sound like it is LGPLed.  How would you
feel if someone included your GPLed work in a package and put the LGPL in
the COPYING file?  And slapped their copyrights on your work?
