No, turning off keyboard on your 64-CPU monster server to save ~10k is
the thing that's absurd. More importantly, it's a support headache
because invariably someone will try to plug a keyboard in and complain
to us when it mysteriously doesn't work. If memory serves, Linus
himself did exactly that shortly after the current input layer was
merged.
