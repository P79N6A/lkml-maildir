config BLK_DEV_UB
        tristate "Low Performance USB Block driver"
        depends on USB
        help
          This driver supports certain USB attached storage devices
          such as flash keys.
          If unsure, say N.

Call me naive, but at least for me it wouldn't have been obvious that 
this option cripples the usb-storage driver.
The warning that this option cripples the usb-storage driver was added 
after people who accidentially enabled this option ("it can't harm") 
in 2.6.9 swamped the USB maintainers with bug reports about problems 
with their storage devices.
