And the mouse driver is biased to always get access to CPU cycles so the 
cursor will always be visible
and working even when the system is totally locked up.  NTFS performance 
is also totally abysimal
when volumes reach 2TB sizes due to fragmentation of the NTFS 
archtiecture.  A problem not shared
with EXT3 FS's.
