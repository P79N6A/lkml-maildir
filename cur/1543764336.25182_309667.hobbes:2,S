The GPL doesn't forbid that. The GPL forbids to put this microcode
directly in the same binary as the GPL code. Of course, nothing forbids
some GPL'ed code to take a binary elsewhere and to upload it into the
hardware.
At least that's my opinion; AIUI, Sven Luther believes it is possible if
the firmware has a decent (but not necessarily free) license.
