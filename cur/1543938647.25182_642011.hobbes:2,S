maybe this would be cleaner if you named the DMA_ATTR enum and used
that instead of unsigned here (and below)?

does this BUG_ON() buy us much?  It seems the only thing we would fail
to oops on is if someone did dma_set_attr(NULL, INVALID) and I'm not
sure it's worth it to BUG here.

returning -EINVAL here instead of 1 would probably be more "kernelish".

so it's OK to pass attrs == NULL into dma_get_attr() but not into
dma_set_attr()?  seems kind of odd.

It seems you're missing a way to initialize a struct dma_attrs.  How
do I clear the flags field to start with?
A macro like DEFINE_DMA_ATTRS() that initializes things for you (like
LIST_HEAD or DEFINE_SPIN_LOCK) would probably be a good thing to have
as well.
Also I guess you could test ARCH_USES_DMA_ATTRS in this file and stub
everything out and define an empty structure if it's not defined.
save a few bytes of stack etc.
