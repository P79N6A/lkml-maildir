	Not wrong but it is one of the possible valid requests. If it
is ignored from other boxes in your setup then you can look 
at new kernels. 2.4.26 and 2.6.4 come with new sysctl flags for ARP. 
arp_filter filters incoming requests but you can use arp_announce to 
control the source IP when sending requests, eg. in IBM server you can set
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth*/arp_announce to 1 or 2 or even just
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_announce to 1 or 2

See Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt for more info.
