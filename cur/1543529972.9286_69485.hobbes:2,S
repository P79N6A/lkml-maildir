Subject: Using alarm() to break out of socket accept

Hope somebody can help here:
We have code that uses an alarm() to routinely break ouf of a socket accept
and then perform some processing (check a flag) and then loop back around
to wait for a connection again.  The code works fine on Solaris, HP-UX,,
AIX, and other flavours but not on RedHat 6.0.
I noticed that by default, SIGALRM is ignored so I unblocked it with
sigprocmask but we are still not getting the behaviour we require.
Is there something I am missing here?
Thanks
Adrian
