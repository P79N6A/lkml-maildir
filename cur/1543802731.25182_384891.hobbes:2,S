Careful.
If one of the swapped branches is your current branch
(i.e. pointed at by .git/HEAD), you need to remember to
switch that as well.
For example, after making the mistake of committing to "master":
	$ git commit ;# oops, to the master
        $ git show-branch origin master read_mostly
	!   [origin] latest update from Linus
         *  [master] latest for read_mostly
          ! [read_mostly] last update from Linus
        ---
         +  [master] latest for read_mostly
        +++ [origin] last update from Linus
Then swap heads:
	$ read_mostly_head=`cat .git/refs/heads/master`
        $ cat .git/refs/heads/read_mostly >.git/refs/heads/read_mostly
	$ echo "$read_mostly_head" >.git/refs/heads/read_mostly
At this point:
        * Your index file still matches $read_mostly_head
	* Your working tree matches your index file
	* Your .git/HEAD is pointing at .git/refs/heads/master
Essentially, you are (you want to be) in read_mostly branch, but
your .git/HEAD incorrectly says you are on the master branch.
So you would need:
	$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/read_mostly
after swapping.  Then you would be on read_mostly branch.
        $ git show-branch origin master read_mostly
	!   [origin] latest update from Linus
         !  [master] last update from Linus
          * [read_mostly] latest for read_mostly
        ---
          + [read_mostly] latest for read_mostly
        +++ [origin] last update from Linus
BTW, would people object if I made the show-branch output like
this?
        $ git show-branch origin master read_mostly
	!   [origin] latest update from Linus
         !  [master] last update from Linus
          * [read_mostly] latest for read_mostly
        ---
          * [read_mostly] latest for read_mostly
        ++* [origin] last update from Linus
