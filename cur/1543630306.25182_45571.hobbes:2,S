Hello.
I changed your perl-script int that way that it only gives out the first line of the patch. This makes the changelog less verbose but you can read the changes very quickly and if you're interested in a certain patch, you can grep the verbose one.
That makes more sense. IMHO I like it better that way. Most people want to see a little overview and are only really interested in the parts they're working on.
This is now the output:
[...]
<hch@infradead.org>
        - remove global_bufferlist_lock
        - fix config.in syntax errors.
        - architecture-independand si_meminfo
<jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>
        - A bunch of fixes.
        - Pmac updates
        - Some more small fixes.
<maxk@qualcomm.com>
        - Bluetooth subsystem sync up
[...]
