Oh. The page is enconded in the migration pte.

If we rely on the migrating thread to hold the page count while the 
page is locked then we could do what the patch below does. But then we 
may race with the freeing of the old page after migration is finished.
If we would add the 
increment of the page count back then we are on the safe side but have 
the problem that we may increment the page count before the migrating
thread gets to the final check. Then the migration check would fail
and we would retry.
