Dear Respectful One,
Permit me to inform you our desire of going into business relationship
with you. I know you might be surprised on recieving this mail from us
due to we have not met before.
By brief introduction , I am Duke and Elizabeth my younger
sister. We are native of bouake district in republic of Cote d'Ivoire. We
are the children of late Chief and Mrs. Kevin Machiti who was assasinated
by the rebels in our home town during the recent political crises of
19th sept. 2003. Untill the death of our parents, they were very wealthy
Cocoa/cafe farmers & exporter based in abidjan the capital city of coted'ivoire.
Before their death in a private specialist hospital, my father called
me on his bed side and secretly confided to me the sum of US$12.5
million dollars which he deposited in one of the banks in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire for onwardly transfer abroad for investment on his proposed cocoa
processing company through an assistance of a foreign partner.
My father also told me his intension to invest part of the money in
collaboration with oil companies in countries like Libya, America or
Europe, but unfortunately he died the way he did without accomplishing his
objective as a result of the rebels attack.
Having know that he will not survive from the injuries he sustained as
a result of the wounds and pains inflinched on him by the rebels, then
advised me to quickly and hurriedly go into his personal underground
safe in our family villa and take the documents covering the deposit in
the bank and look for a true and trustworthy foreigner assist us as
partner to front to the bank as our late parents partner abroad for
immediate transfer of the money for investment in any lucrative business
of our chioce for our future welfare.
Upon the instruction and advice by my father before he finally died, I
therefore request your assistance to help us for onward transfer of the
money to your country for investment partnership with you in any
lucrative business in your country.
We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum immediately the
transfer is made, while 2.5% also will be set aside to cover all the
expenses you might incure on the process.
Upon your acceptance to our proposal, kindly get back to me through the
above email address so that we can discuss further process on the ways
to achieve this golden success together.
Note, we are still in the refugee camp Yamussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, We
need your urgent attention to this mail because we want to leave here
for a better future with you abroad, as the rebels had killed our parent
and also have taken over my home town as their operational territory,
we look forward to you to help us with most urgency and honesty.
Expecting your reply soon.
Best Regard and God Bless you.
Duke & sister
