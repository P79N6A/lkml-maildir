I've been getting these for ever, and they don't seem to
do any harm ... but they're rather worrying, and I'm curious
as to whath they are.
I suspect the "Increasing Tx FIFO threshold" is just being
unnecessarily verbose ... but the "Something Wicked happened!"
error doesn't look too happy ... any clues as to what this is?
Thanks,
Martin.
