Do you really want to udelay this long with interrupts disabled?
Certainly comments in kcs_event[_handler] indicate you're aware of the
issue, but the code does not belie this fact :)
Not only is the udelay itself "long" relatively speaking, but it's in a
loop.  Which also calls a function that contains a loop that is
potentially infinite is hardware is being wonky.
