Sounds great! I'll build new kernels for all my boxes as soon as I can
get a hold on said patch. At least it "felt" cleaner and I/O was a
little less of a handbrake using libata, so I'll go for it once again.
Just one more thing, I had to hack a little on Kconfig files to make the
"newer" promise driver available - if my memory doesn't fail me I sent a
patch, more like a RFC. Are some drivers intentionally left out of
Kbuild? I could not trigger any problem so far, using ata_piix on this
laptop, and pata_via / pata_pdc2027x on my desktop.
The only strangeness I had was some windoze firmware upgrade tool for my
ATAPI CDRW drive running in wine, poking on every sg device in
existence, thus triggering a freeze as it messed with the disks in some
wicked way. But since this was never intended to work in the first
place, I was happy with it working after simply deleting all sg devs
corresponding with disks. And I guess it is worth mentioning that the
SCSI IOCTLs in question are only accepted by the SCSI stack when the
process is run as root, so it's not exactly something anybody could try
on a machine he cannot already kill.  Attempts to run this as an
ordinary user would make the firmware tool get stuck with an all-empty
progress bar, and the wine processes were easily TERM-able.
If there's anything I might want to try out or you'd want to know, like
lspci output and such, please let me know. I'm not home right now, but
here goes for starters.

This one has been working perfectly so far, on an ancient Dell Latitude
CPiA.
