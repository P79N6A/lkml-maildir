Sounds like I need to move to 2.6. I noticed the elevator is coalescing 
quite well, and since I am posting mostly continguous runs of sectors, 
what ends up at the adapter level would probably not change much much 
between 2.4 and 2.6 since I am maxing out the driver request queues as 
it is (255 pending requests of 32 scatter/gather elements of 256 sector 
runs). 2.6 might help but I suspect it will only help alleviate the 
submission overhead, and not make much difference on performance since 
the 3Ware card does have an upward limit on outstanding I/O requests.
