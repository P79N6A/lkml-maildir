Yes, it's not a new problem, I was just pointing out the fact that there
are deeper issues already there in the same area.
Today, we mostly get lucky because we rarely take an irq during boot
time PCI probe but I've seen it happen (one easy way to screw things up
on -many- machines is to enable the DEBUG stuff in the PCI probe code
and use a serial console for example, especially if access to the device
with the serial ports in it gets temporarily cut off).
Cheers,
Ben.
