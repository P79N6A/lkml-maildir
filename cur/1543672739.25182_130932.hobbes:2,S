No, ide_init_queue() sets it to 256, so I want 65536 too.
Note that it should be done after setting queue max sectors to 256,
because not only ide-disk depends on this code:
	max_sectors = 256;
	(...)
	/*
	 * Added "< max_sectors" check for safety if it will
	 * be called again later with rq->size = 65536.
	 * I don't believe it ever is.
	*/
	if (hwif->rqsize < max_sectors)
		max_sectors = hwif->rqsize;
	blk_queue_max_sectors(q, max_sectors);
	if (!hwif->rqsize)
		hwif->rqsize = hwif->addressing ? 65536 : 256;

Yeah, I forgot that Linus' tree IDE is not based on taskfile IO yet.
But anyway there are REQ_DRIVE_TASKFILE requests using this codepatch,
so you should also check rq->flags & REQ_DRIVE_TASKFILE
and task->addreesing.

It should check for rq_lba48(rq) || task->addressing.
After taskfile IO switch it will be checking for task->addressing only.

Nope ;-), please move setting of hwif->rqsize from setup-pci.c to where
it belongs, ide_init_queue() in ide-probe.c.
