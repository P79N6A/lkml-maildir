Really. You got my attention now. We still need the SGI driver inetrface
to make Xsgi and other apps work from IRIX. I need to talk to you anyways
about making fbdev work with DRI. I will email you in private about this. 
I will be gone for a few day but will be back by sunday. Then we can begin
discussing this topic. I also would like to talk about other topics as
well.
