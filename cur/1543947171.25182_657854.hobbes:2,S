Hi,
In MSI-HOWTO, it's said:
"Using MSI enables the device functions to support two or more vectors, which can be configured to target different CPUs to increase scalability."
So how can I set up MSI-X vectors to target different CPUs? I want to allocate the same number of MSI-X vectors as CPUs, and equally distribute them to every CPU.
Is it automatically done by Linux when I call pci_enable_msix()? If yes, how? If not, what should I do? My guess is to set the affinity of the interrupts manually. Am I right?
Please CC'ed me (caiying@yahoo.com) answers/comments  in response to this posting. 
Thanks,
Ying
