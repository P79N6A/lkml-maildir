A friend of mine currently experiences problems resulting in wrongly
calculated bogomips.  Linux suddenly calculates only half of the bogomips.
This means that the clock is double fast and DNS is not working.  I
also suppose that you should not try to use a cd writer.  In theory,
I guess all timings will be wrong.
