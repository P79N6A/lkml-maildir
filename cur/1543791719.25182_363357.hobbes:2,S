If we were only a few options away from running Andy's varying load
mix with something close to ideal performance, we'd be in fat city,
and Andy would never have been driven to write that rant.
There's more to it than that, but it is not as impossible as a battery
with the efficiencies you (and the rest of us) dream of.
Andy has used systems that resemble what he is seeking.  So he is not
asking for something clearly impossible.  Though it might not yet be
possible, in ways that contribute to a continuing healthy kernel code
base.
It's an interesting challenge - finding ways to improve the kernel's
performance on such high end loads, that are also suitable and
desirable (or at least innocent enough) for inclusion in a kernel far
more widely used in embeddeds, desktops and ordinary servers.
