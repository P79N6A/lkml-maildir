	Hi Marcelo,
	First, an apology. The changes were not as bad as I though and
I only had to fix a few patches (but I could not verify that
yesterday).
	This is my IrDA update for 2.4.20. Those IrDA patches are
mostly the same collection that went in 2.5.8-pre2. It fixes some
important bug, or are trivally obvious fixes. I also added some new
drivers that were added in 2.5.22. All stuff really safe.
	My remaining patch queue is still pretty full (including
Stanford checker bugs - see my web page), but that will wait for
later.
	Patches tested on 2.4.19 and recompiled on 2.4.20-pre1.
	Have fun...
	Jean
