Yesterday I finally got around to testing it. It seems the patch has 
been applied in Linus's tree so I downloaded the latest BK and tried it.
Still does not work for me but this time it's different. Before the 
patch SCSI worked fine but PCI NICs caused hangs. Now I can't test PCI 
NICs because even the onboard 53c825 SCSI hangs - seems it gets no 
interrupts.
It detects the HBA, tries device discovery, gets a timeout, ABORT, 
timeout, TARGET RESET, timeout, BUS RESET, timeout, HOST RESET and there 
it hangs.
Does it work for anyone else on Powerstack II Pro4000 (Utah)?
