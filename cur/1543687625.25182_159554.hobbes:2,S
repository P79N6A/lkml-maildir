A parallel kernel build can generate some decent thrashing, too, but I
wanted a short and simple test case that conveniently provides the
information I need for both logging daemon and post processing tool.
Note: The benchmark could trivially be made more evil which would prevent
2.4.21 from finishing over 30 times faster (as it often does). I
intentionally left it they way it is.
While everybody seems to be working on interactivity, I am currently
looking at this corner case. This should be pretty much orthogonal to your
own work.
