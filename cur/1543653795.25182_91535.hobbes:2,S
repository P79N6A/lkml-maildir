In this instance I'd disagree.  Think about UML.  UML has:
	include/asm-um/*.h
	include/asm-um/arch -> include/asm-i386
When building for UML, what happens if you need to get to a machine
specific file for something, and the i386 include files do:
	#include <asm/mach-generic/foo.h>
Yep, it fails.
Now guess why we in the ARM community haven't even bothered to look at
UML yet?  There's over 1MB of include files that would need to be moved,
along with countless #include statements needing to be fixed up.
For something that would be nice to have, and probably run quite well on
the ARM architecture (due to some nice features ARM has, especially for
UML's jail mode) there isn't enough interest in it to warrant such a
painful reorganisation.
I'd therefore strongly recommend NOT going down the path of adding
subdirectories to include/asm-*.
