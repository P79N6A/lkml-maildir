I was obviously considering this and saw this as next unification step.
But I will try to integrate it in this serie and will probarly extend
the serie to include consolidation of both the arch-config-settings
and the various kconfig-helper variables like the DMAR_FLOPPY_WA
above.
It will take a day or two since I have a few non-linux things to do first.
