I originally said I'd wait till the sched patches settled down before tackling 
it but it didn't look like that was ever going to happen and broken nice on 
SMP is a real bug biting people now so I figured I should just tackle it 
anyway. I don't mind if we just work on it later though.

Definitely different I agree. As for the performance impact the statistics 
alone don't tell us if they're for good or evil, but we can look at it again 
separately when we tackle smp nice again. It is a real issue for users now, 
though so it would be good if we can have a calmer period in the future to do 
this (smp nice) by itself.
These are the four patches Andrew:
sched-implement-nice-support-across-physical-cpus-on-smp.patch
sched-change_prio_bias_only_if_queued.patch
sched-account_rt_tasks_in_prio_bias.patch
sched-smp-nice-bias-busy-queues-on-idle-rebalance.patch
The other HT patch by me is separate and a bugfix so please leave that in.
Cheers,
Con
