Subject: [PATCH] x86: simplify HIGHMEM-related Kconfig entries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/14/200

Additionally remove the dependency of X86_PAE on !HIGHMEM4G - at least
I can't understand why that dependency existed.
