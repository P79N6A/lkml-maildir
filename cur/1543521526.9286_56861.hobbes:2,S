Hi,
I am trying to find a way to catch all IP packets (OUTGOING, HOST,
OTHERHOST etc.) before the rest of the stack processes them. 
It is important that this is done from a module and involves no patching of the 
kernel source.
Doing a dev_add_pack() with type ETH_P_IP only gets incoming packets and 
ETH_P_ALL clones the sk_buff's. It is important that the packet is not 
duplicated as this is intended to be used for a firewall type of 
application.
Is there any other way to do this ? (Except for a runtime kernel patch of 
ip_rcv and ip_output (which I am desperately trying to avoid)).
Help is greatly appreciated.
chris
