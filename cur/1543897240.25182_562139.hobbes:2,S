makes fine, but requires :
export ARCH=avr32
export CROSS_COMPILE=avr32-linux-
make defconfig
make
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  MODPOST vmlinux
  UIMAGE arch/avr32/boot/images/uImage
"mkimage" command not found - U-Boot images will not be built
  Image arch/avr32/boot/images/uImage is ready
make[1]: `arch/avr32/boot/images/vmlinux.elf' is up to date.
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 20 modules
