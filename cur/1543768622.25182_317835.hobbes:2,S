Exactly. Any scheme that requires a busy CPU to poll at some intervals
will also have problems: you are putting more work on the busy CPUs,
there will be superfluous IPIs, and there will be cases where the
imbalance is allowed to get too large. Not really much different from
doing the work with the idle CPUs really, *except* that it will introduce
a lot of complexity that nobody has shown is needed.

Well the complex solution won't go in until it is shown that the
simple version has fundamental failure cases - but I don't think
we need to make a final decision yet do we?
