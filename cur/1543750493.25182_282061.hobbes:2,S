Hi Roman & lkml
Here follows a few kconfig patches.
Main purpose is to improve readability of the output when doing  search
and to inculde dependency information in the help text.
They are not pushed to my kbuild tree yet - will see if this generate
any feedback first.
One will now see something like this when getting help on a menu item:
CONFIG_FOO
bla bla bla
depends on:
 USB
selects:
 HOTPLUG
selected by:
 FW_LOADER
Empty lines are omitted - so a symbol that does not seletcs any other
symbol the symbol line will not appear.
Let me know if you want me to push them towards mainstream.
	Sam
