That is still high. Modern flash drives will do 100.000 writes for SLC 
(single-level cells) or 10.000 writes for MLC (multi-level cells) [1].

This is also assuming _perfect_ wear leveling. There are real world 
drives with crappy (or even buggy) wear levelling. I've seen CF cards 
die with much less writting than this.
Even then, with just 10.000 writes, this is already reduced to 1.29 
years, assuming 64kb/sec average writting.
If you take into consideration that you can actually write 6Mbytes/sec 
on a modern CF card, you can fry a 256Mb card in just 5 days, if you 
write continuously.
