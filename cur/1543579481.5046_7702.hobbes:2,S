Well, I know this. But I fear hardcoded timings won't really help here,
unles everyone out there ran their chipsets at 33 MHz, in which case the
calculation gains the exact same results (you can compare that) as the
hardcoded numbers for UDMA timings.

Ok, the VIA driver from clean 2.2.18 does nothing. It doesn't even use
hardcoded timings. It doesn't touch any timing tables. It just blindly
enables prefetch and writeback in the chips. The thing works because it
relies on BIOS to set things up correctly, and this is often the case,
yes.

Well, there are other ways the motherboard maker can screw up the
traces, and often this happens:
chipset --------\
                |
chipset ------\ |
              | \------ header
              \-------- header
So the different traces have different lengths and thus some bits arrive
earlier than others to the header, causing the same CRC errors.
Also it seems that some boards don't use exactly 33.3 MHz PCI clock, but
something like 33.7 or even more, which causes some drives to fail with
them if the chipset is set to the 0xe0 (2 pciclk/ideclk) value.
This is because they use very cheap base 14MHz crystals.
As I said before - if you leave 'idebus' at 33, the calculated timings
are exactly the same as the hardcoded values would be (I think there is
a difference in PIO2 mode, where the calculation gives a slightly larger
active time and shorter recovery, but this is OK with the specs).
And this is also why the cheaply made motherboards fail. (They don't
care to make that VIA UDMA66 ide working correctly when they have a
UDMA100 HPT370 onboard)?
... btw, if we ever implement UDMA slowdown code based on CRC errors, we
should differentiate between CRC errors on read and CRC errors on write,
because each are caused by a different problem ...
