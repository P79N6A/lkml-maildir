	This recently happened to me on swbell.net.  I found they have one
phone number for "56k/V90 whatever" and one phone line for "slower"
connections.  My notebook with "56k/V90"  modem under linux would not
connect to the "56k" line.  The desktop had a 33.6 modem and wouldn't
either.  I used the other phone line and the JOY returned.  GoFiggur.
	Any more insite is appreciated.
PPPFunn!!
