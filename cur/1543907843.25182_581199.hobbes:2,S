Any code that does the equivalent of printk(KERN_foo "\n message");
egrep -r "printk[[:space:]]*\([[:space:]]*KERN.*\\\n[A-JL-Za-jl-z[:space:]" --include=*.[ch] *
At least 61 instances right now.

"Could" most always leads to an interesting argument.
Future minimization of introduced error is a benefit
not an absolute.
Adding the ability to log higher priority KERN_<level>
without removing printk altogether for embedded systems
seems useful.  You could leave out say just KERN_INFO,
KERN_NOTICE and KERN_WARN levels.
Worth the churn is another question, though git seems to
allow most everyone to resync to tree wide changes pretty
easily.
If new pr_<level> defines aren't accepted, I suggest
removing the current ~200 uses of pr_info.

I'm not sure how.  Maybe you have an idea you could share?
Maybe an external tool to reassemble complete messages from
prefixed {{cookie}} message logs would be fine for awhile.
Perhaps something like:
cookie = printk_block_start()
printk_block[s](cookie)
printk_block_end(cookie)?
where printk_block emits cookie when multiple cookies
are active.
