FWIW, I run an ASUS P3B-F (440BX chipset) with a 20267 add-on
card and a WD Caviar WD800JB UDMA100 disk as a server spooling
News and other high-volume data. Even when moving GBs of data
around as fast as the disk can read or write it, the system
has never been less than rock solid with the 2.6 kernels.
Of course, ACPI is disabled and the 20267 is not sharing
interrupts with anything else.
