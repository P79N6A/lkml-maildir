Obviously... since they're handles, not FDs...
[BTW, are you using Windows' idea of storing the objects in process space,
in a
page that's inaccessible to the app itself, and passing pointers into this
page
as the handles?]

So what if they aren't files?
If you look at (e.g.) AIX's poll(), it allows you to put SysV semaphore IDs
in
pollfd structures. (Actually they do even more--- they have an extended
pollfd
struct; but even without it, just putting a handle instead of FD and a
special
event code in a normal pollfd should suffice...)

I'm afraid I'm not following your logic in this; I believe most Win32 attrs
can
be mapped to more generic abstractions which should be able to exist at
'struct
file' level.  (And even if not, a Win32 file handle could just hold two
pointers---
one to the 'struct file', and one to the extra attrs...)

Huh? Where did you get this?
Looking at my copy of MSDN (July '00), the PulseEvent remarks more-or-less
suggest
an implementation like
    SetEvent(e)
    ResetEvent(e)
I don't see any mention of 'currently waiting' vs 'new' waiters. (Besides, I
doubt MS
tries to solve this in the SMP case...)

Yes, this is a valid point...  I wonder if it's possible to add _just_ this
to
poll()...
