it might be a good idea to point out that this is the address of the byte
after the last one covered by the vma, not the address of the last byte.
(are there any architectures where we allow a vma at the end of memory ?  Is
the mm/ code handling ->vm_end = 0 correctly ?)

Each page of "real" RAM.  In particular I think MMIO pages still don't have
a struct page.

Or make it cover large pages, which might be even more of a win ..
