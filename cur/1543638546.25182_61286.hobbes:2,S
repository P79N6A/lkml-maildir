My friend had this idea, and we are considering switching to using the
serial port in this case. We're just trying to see what we can do in
software, if we got nothing but bad results, that (using a pic) will
eventualy become our main choice. The reason to nothing doing so is that
the device is somewhat tolerant, so if we got good average results, maybe
we keep it as is. But if we decide to use the serial port, we'd better
using the pic solution anyway, killing both problems (the parallel port
uses to be used by a printer, while almost everyone has a spare serial
port). In future we might consider using USB, It seems that there's a PIC
series with usb interfacing, but for now that's future.
Thanks for your help,
Alexandre
