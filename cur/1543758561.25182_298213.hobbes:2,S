I don't see this limit on my computer. I'm currently running the lmbench
with a new fork connector patch (one that enable/disable fork connector)
on an SMP computer. I will send results and the new patch tomorrow
because the test takes a while...
I'm using a small patch provided by Evgeniy and not included in the
2.6.11-rc4-mm1 tree.
Best regards,
