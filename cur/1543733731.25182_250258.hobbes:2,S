Define these as long, not int.  No need to waste 32 perfectly good bits on 
64bit platforms.
The main thing missing is documentation. You need clear comments what
the locking rules are and what compat is good for.
And you should change the code style to follow Documentation/CodingStyle
Other than that it looks ok to me.
