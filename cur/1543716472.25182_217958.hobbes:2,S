This is ugly, but it should do the trick:
int rv;
char *argv[4] = {"/bin/cp", "/tmp/foo", "/tmp/bar", NULL};
char *envp[3] = {"HOME=/", "PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin", NULL};
rv = call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, 1);
if(rv < 0) {
	/* error handling */
}
Called from kernel, done in userspace. And if you want to access an SQL
database from kernel tomorrow, it's just a matter of changing the
usermode helper.
(BTW, if you need to copy files from kernel, it's usually a sign of bad
design)
