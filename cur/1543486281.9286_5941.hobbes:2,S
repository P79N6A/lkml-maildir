Hi,
   Could any one please tell me how to I add sensor module to my
   kernel (2.2.1)?, I tried lm_sensors, hell lot of errors, I don't
   think I can fix them and I don't want to. Is there any module
   provided with Kernel source 2.2.1, if so how to I activate it?
   Thank you for your help
Brdgs
