Well, I wouldn't be one of those folks.  In fact, how big is dash and
some select set of shell utilities?  If they aren't that big, it might
make sense to include them all the time so that a simple command-line
option on boot is all that's necessary in order to break into a
pre-kinit interactive shell.  That would make the resulting system
more debuggable by definition.  Then all we will would have to do is
make sure the distro's use the kernel-supplied kinit solution, instead
of rolling their own non-standard version.
