Note that this is great.  We should do the same with bugs.h which is, if 
anything, an even worse mess.

Looked a little harder, and it should *definitely* be moved to generic, 
since it also includes the CPU name string check, which is supported 
even on Intel P4 CPUs.

That's the 3DNow! bit... I was thinking it might be handled specially, 
but it looks like that's only done for Centaur chips.  Are you sure your 
CPU isn't being mis-identified as Centaur by the new code?
