Actually there's also a non-malicious case in which waiting for
requests to finish won't work: when one fuse filesystem is accessing
another.
Since we are blocking new fuse requests, that might block a fuse
daemon, which in turn makes it impossible to finish the pending
request.
And this is not at all theoretical, I know that encfs is used over
various other fuse filesystems like sshfs or ntfs-3g.
Yeah, stacking userspace filesystems could be done entirely in
userspace, and I'm actually working on that (with fuse-2.7.0 already
supporting some basic stacking).
But the point is, that the "wait for fuse to quiescence" hack would
not work in todays environment.
