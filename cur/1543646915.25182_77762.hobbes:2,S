Hi,
I got the following when I powered off my laptop. Normally it powers off
without problems but this time it didn't and I managed to write this down
by hand. I didn't write down the stack frame information. Don't know if
this is useful.
Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at include/asm/semaphore.h:119
