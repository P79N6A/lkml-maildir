Unlikely.  It's hard enough already when somebody who doesn't
speak the language submits a bugreport by email or through
bugzilla.
I don't want to imagine receiving a bug report from eg. Japan
that has a cut'n'pasted kernel error in Japanese. It's not just
that I can't read Japanese ... I don't even have the FONT to
display it.

Rik
