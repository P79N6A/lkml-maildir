   Believe it or not, drive->dn will be 0 or 1 in this case, so & is 
superfluous. :-)
   I don't insist on dropping it though...

   I just don't undestand what this bit is good for in IT8172G... 
Perhaps by clearing it once could achieve PIO0 timings, just like by 
clearing the fast timing bits on PIIX?

   No, IT8172G just implements them differently. But you can still find 
in this driver a good example of how things should be done...

   That's because PIO modes above 2 necessiate IORDY, while for mode 2 
the drive can require it optionally.

   If was only happening for some drives, you probably shouldn't keep it...

   This is usually handled by blacklisting the drives for the user's

   You'll probably need to add this as a quirk to drivers/pci/quirks.c 
-- unless the bootloader sets the controller to native mode itself.

   Yes, you're correct. You should add the code to force it enabled if 
the bootloader doesn't do that.

   These masks were stolen from the piix.c driver and are determined by 
the limitation of the timing register fileds being only 2-bit wide. 
IT8172G has these bits implemented differently, hence the limitation 
shouldn't apply. You shouldn't just update the masks without doing 
anythiung about programming the modes...
