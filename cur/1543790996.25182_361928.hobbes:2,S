Yes, a particular atomic kmap slot is simply a static, per-cpu scalar. 
It's just like
int foo[NR_CPUS];
	...
	foo(smp_processor_id());
and all the same rules apply.
The use of KM_BOUNCE_READ does appear to be incorrect.  bounce_copy_vec()
will use KM_BOUNCE_READ from interrupt context, so if the EDAC code is
interrupted by the block layer while it holds that kmap, it will find that
it's suddenly diddling with a different physical page.
So to use KM_BOUNCE_READ, the EDAC code nees to disable local interrupts,
or to use a different (or new) slot.
In what contexts is edac_mc_scrub_block() called?  If process context, then
KM_USER0 would suit.
Ah, edac_mc_scrub_block() is passing the pageframe address to
kunmap_atomic() - that's a common bug.  It needs to pass in the virtual
address which kmap_atomic() returned.
