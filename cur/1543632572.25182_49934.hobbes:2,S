Keith: You're becoming even more stubborn and blinded than ESR was.
Linus became interested in kbuild-2.5 when someone else than you decided to
feed him with small patches, exactly what I told you a while ago and what

Shame on you Keith.
Resisting the widely known Linus procedure will lead you nowhere, whether it
looks stupid or not to you.
