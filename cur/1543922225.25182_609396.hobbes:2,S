Subject: [patch 2/2] Use BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE for kdump
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/409

This patch uses the BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE, introduced in the previous patch,
to avoid conflicts while reserving the memory for the kdump carpture kernel
(crashkernel=).
