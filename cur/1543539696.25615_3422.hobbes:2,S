Big words, those. You sure you are speaking for Linux and not just for
yourself there? Who/how appointed you as our spokesman anyway?

Sure the other OSes have scrambled to fix the self same bug after you found
out... References, please? As it is terribly damaging, CERT must have put
out an advisory about it by now. Ditto?

One of the bases of this OS's greatness is that stuff is hashed out in
public before a decision is taken (peer review and all that), only Linus
has ultimate authority here (and even that is limited in some ways). And
your screaming "Fire!" and flaming away without producing a shred of proof
or even a credible outline of the danger has to be enough to do mayor
changes to the kernel, just because you say so?
