I just install a new kernel 2.4.21. While the kerenl start, it can't detect my usb mouse.
There is also a line found in the kernel starting record
"kmd: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k scsi -hostadapter.errno:2"
I also can't connect my adsl connection.  
While I connect the adsl in xwindow, it shows 
"/sbin/adsl-start:line217: 2126 Terminated $CONNECT "$@" >/dev/null/2>&1".
I don't know why.
Would anyone please help me.
Thanks very much~~
