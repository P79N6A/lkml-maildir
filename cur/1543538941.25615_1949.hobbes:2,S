Not exactly sure what you mean, so I'll list everything I can think of:  B-)
Not overclocking.
Using default bios settings (now, had aggressive memory timings).
Have proper cabling.
Didn't see any error messages (lost the logs so I can't check).
I was using UDMA.
Not using hdparm.
Not using anything like powertweak.
One thing I thought of last night was that it worked fine for several
months, with 2.3.99 all the way up through 2.4.0-test2-pre7 (I miskeyed in
original message).  When it happened the first time, I backed off to
test2-pre4 and ran that way for a bit.  Then when test4 came out, I thought
I give that a try and the problem happened again.
Thanks much,
Leland
