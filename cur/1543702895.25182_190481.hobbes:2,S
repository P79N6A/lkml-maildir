I have encountered a strange issue in 2.6.0 and 2.6.1
I run a PGP Public key server on this machine and under 2.4.x it's
"smooth as silk". But if I boot under 2.6.x, it's gaurenteed failure. If
I try to build a database using the build command (this is an sks
server, so it's sks build or sks fastbuild) I IMMEDIATELY get  Bdb
error. But the exact same command with the exact same libraries and
input files under 2.4.20 works without a hitch.
Anyone got any ideas? Anything else I can provide to assist in debugging?
