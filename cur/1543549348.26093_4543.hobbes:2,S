Andries,
Going back to 2.4.0test5 with my patch it works perfectly.
I will move this forward to 2.4.0test8, but all the patch does, is to
expand the select method beyond the SELECT_DRIVE(hwif,drive).
Since all drives report as an effective master, the select code only raise
the device to that level.
Thus I tend to focus on filesystems.
The fact that partition check points are were it craps out on two
different systems.
One Cascade Project and the other is the DupliDisk II RaidCase, by
sratching the first superblock on every other boot and not in 2.2.X
kernels or 2.4.0-test5 currently testing and stepping forward.
Cheers,
