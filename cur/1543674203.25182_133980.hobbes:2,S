If you look carefully, source back-compatibility has been preserved
for network drivers.  Most API changes are accepted without comment
because they are easily made back-compatible.  The module_param API
breaks that.
Network driver-land is different from SCSI-land, where the amount of 2.5
differences is so high one more change doesn't make a difference.

An API already exists, and it is source compatible between 2.4 and 2.5:
ethX=.... on the kernel command line.
The proper patch would pick up options from there.
