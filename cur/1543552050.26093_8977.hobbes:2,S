Actually, this was considered.  However, in those dark days, the ISO
had not yet standardized the international symbol for the fucking
retard.  A symbol for "dimwit crossing" was in wide-spread use, and it
had been incorporated into an ANSI draft standard, but there were
certain legal issues---Microsoft claimed it infringed on their "flying
windows" trademark.
Instead, the penguin, the stupidest and nastiest of all flightless
birds (ostrich?  BZZZT-thanks-for-playing!) was felt to best symbolize
the glorious mosaic that is the Linux development community.
But, thanks for your input!
