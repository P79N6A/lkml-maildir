I managed to compile a "Testing" 1.4.31 version (in fact, version 1.4 
didn't compile because I didn't have a "linux" link pointing to kernel 
sources; version 1.4.31 tells that it's missing - so both versions 
compile fine).
The problem is... I'm not sure how to start with it. The package doesn't 
have much documentation (other than "read the source"), does it?
On the other hand, I see it comes with a couple of useful tools, like sh 
(dash)... They are also pretty small, so everything should fit into 300 
kB (dash=70kB, kinit=70kB, mount=12kB).
As I understand, this is what I have to do:
1. compile a kernel with initramfs, which will include a cpio image with 
some tools
2. tools/scripts in cpio image should do the following:
mount /proc
DISKS=$(cat /proc/diskstats)
for WORD in $DISKS
do
[ $WORD = sdb1 ] && echo "partition found, what next?..."
done
# do a similar logic for sda1
Am I correct? Of course I'd appreciate how to achieve point 2 (where now 
"partition found, what next?..." is).
