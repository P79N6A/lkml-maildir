OO is indeed != C++. But since it's a relative if C, it's the most
suitable option to use in the kernel.

OO design had nothing to do with OO implementation. I can design a system
totally in OO, and implement it in C. Really stupid thing to do I think,
but it's possible..
I think there was a thread about C++ in the kernel a while ago, I'll see
if I can find it.
