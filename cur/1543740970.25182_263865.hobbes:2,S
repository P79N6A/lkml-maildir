How do I deal with something like a Redhat kernel where CONFIG_AGP is
set but the kernel may be running on hardware without AGP present. In
this case the AGP modules will not be loaded but DRM will still have
symbol references to the AGP symbols. You have to have some kind of
weak symbol reference in this case.
