Hello,
    Ok, i should learn to leave well enough alone, but i don't. After
successfully installing a monolithic 2.5.67 kernel i decided i wanted
modules, so i made them, and what happened, it hung after the initrd
initialized. So, when 2.5.68 came out i of course grab it, compile/install
it without a hitch, but for one thing, as of now make install did not make
an initrd for that install. Does anyone know how to make this manually, it
won't boot without one?
Thanks.
Dave.
