I can't comment on that plan.

Perhaps: I think it already depends on what the architecture does.
newprot is used (a) to set vm_page_prot and (b) for use in pte_modify
(which change_protection applies to each pte present).
Now I think vm_page_prot is irrelevant to the kinds of VMA you are
interested in?  It's essential to provide the permissions/protections
when faulting a new page in, but your VMAs are fully managed by the
driver, and have all ptes already in place?  So wouldn't use vm_page_prot.
And pte_modify is implemented per-architecture: looking just at the
i386 implementation, yes, _PAGE_CHG_MASK looks like it'll mask off
the bits you understandably want it to retain.

I think it's the per-architecture implementations of pte_modify that
you need to adjust.
It might be nice, but probably irrelevant, to have vm_page_prot maintained
in a similar way.  Whether every arch can do that with a straightforward
MPROT_MASK or _PAGE_CHG_MASK is not obvious to me: would more likely
need a pte_modify-like macro to do it.
But would that even be correct?  The same vm_page_prot would be applied
also to anonymous COWed pages from the mapping.  Very exceptional in the
case that interests you; but perhaps it's simpler to keep vm_page_prot
just for the rwx part of it.
> Alternatively, is there a way to disable mprotect() for a VMA?
Not at present.  It would be easier to add a VM_flag for that,
than to correct every architecture's pte_modify.  I'm not sure
whether "easier" amounts to "better" here.

I very much doubt that.  Exporting a functional interface to it would
be preferable; but even that, I think the core mm would strongly resist
- the less of the pte business we export the better.  What were you
wanting it exported for?
