The patch to "remove combined mode quirk" (git bisect says
8cdfb29c0cd8018f92214c11c631d8926f4cb032) makes my laptop run slower
than a dead sloth.  "hdparm -T" indicates that buffered disk reads on my
hard drive drop from 48-50 MB/sec to 1-2MB/sec, and the system is nearly
unusable.
System is a Dell Inspiron E1705 (Core 2 Duo 2.16GHz) running x86_64 FC6.
