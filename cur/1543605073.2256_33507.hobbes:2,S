I'm not doing a comparison of the VM in 2.4.5 and the newer kernels, I'm
saying that based on the reports I have been seeing here I have not been
willing to risk moving to a newer kernel becouse I couldn't trust the VM
not to give me problems on my production boxes. the 2.4.5 has it's
problems, but they are survivable (except on one box which I had to
remove)
it's not a direct comparison of the kernels, it's a matter of being able
to trust that the new kernel won't hang me out to dry under load. (and I
am one of the many people out here who doesn't have the ability to
simulate the load before going into production)
