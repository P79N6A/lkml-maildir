That seems like an awful lot of work. I suggest that what you
put in /etc/cachefilesd.conf is a line like:
   security_context:"<whatever>"
and have your daemon pass "<whatever>" into the kernel using
a cachefile mechanism. The kernel code can call
security_secctx_to_secid("<whatever>") to determine if it's valid.
No need to invoke LSM specific code in your daemon. You may need
to have an application, say cachefileselinuxcontext, that will
read the current policy and spit out an appropriate value of
"<whatever>", but that can be separate and LSM specific without
mucking up your basic infrastructure applications.

For LSM's that don't use labels what you will have to pass in
won't be a label, it will be something else. But since any LSM
that wants to do networking or audit will have to deal with
secid's and secctx's the method outlined above ought to fit the
bill.
