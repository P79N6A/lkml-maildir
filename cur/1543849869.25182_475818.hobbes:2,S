Some vendor shipped pdf and TeX tools are problematic. It works
correctly on Red Hat except for kernel-api which has become too big for
the default settings when ext4 was added. The TeX hash size gets
exceeded, TeX emits
"! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [hash size=60000].
If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me."
Really it would be nice to find a more modern way from the input to pdf
without going via tex.
