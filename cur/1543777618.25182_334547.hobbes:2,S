Roland at Red Hat. See the kernel list but 2.6.9 had an interesting hole
where you could crash the system by playing games with setsid and
threaded applications.
RHEL bugs really are best in the RHEL bugzilla, or through your support
contact as a customer. That ensures that the bug is processed promptly
and chased up for you while bugzilla is just for bug collection.
