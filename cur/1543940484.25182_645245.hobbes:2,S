I still don't see these changes, I wanted to check, make sure...
Are there mirrors on the way to here?
James I would like to remind you that one small piece is missing 
from the bidi tree, as I saw it from here, it's the few patches from
scsi-pending. Mainly arm will break which is a grate loss.
I'm going home now, I'll review all the patches tomorrow and compare
to what I have, to make sure nothing was forgotten. What a waste of a day
I pulled from Linus this morning apparently minutes before the merge, and
chased a none existent bug in my tree. Sigh
