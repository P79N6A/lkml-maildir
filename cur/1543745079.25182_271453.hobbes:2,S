I think trying to remove repeated inl()'s in read_pmtmr is a better 
fix for this issue. As John mentioned in other thread, we should do 
repeated reads only when something looks broken. Not always.
TSC counter stops couting when the CPU is in deep sleep state. It 
should be OK to use tsc with Centrinos which support Enhanced Speedstep
Technology. But, it will have issues with older system that supports 
Older Speedstep. So, I would say using pm_timer as default is better 
as that works correctly on most of the systems. 
Thanks,
Venki
