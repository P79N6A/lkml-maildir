Subject: Bind mount bug?

I'm not sure whether this is a bug or expected behavior.
Suppose I create a "looped" bind mount situation as follows.
# mkdir test
# touch test/foo
# mkdir bindtest
# touch bindtest/bar
# mkdir bindtest/test
# mount --bind test/ bindtest/test/
# ls bindtest/test/
foo
# mount --bind bindtest/ test/
# ls test/
bar  test
# ls test/test/
#
I'd expected the last command to list "foo", but it shows an empty dir.
Shouldn't it also show the original contents of test (as they were before 
the first bind mount)?
# mount | grep test
/root/test on /root/bindtest/test type none (rw,bind)
/root/bindtest on /root/test type none (rw,bind)
Cheers,
