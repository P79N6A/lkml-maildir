It's a big problem.  If you cannot implement FMRs in such a way that
you can handling having map_phys_fmr being called in a context that
can't sleep, then I think the only option is to remove your FMR
support.  It's an optional device feature, so this should be OK
(although the iSER driver currently seems to depend on a device
supporting FMRs, which is probably going to be a problem with iWARP
support in the future anyway).
The fact that consumers can map FMRs from interrupt context, while
holding locks, etc, is pretty fundamental to the use of FMRs so I
don't see any way around the requirement that map_phys_fmr never
sleep.
