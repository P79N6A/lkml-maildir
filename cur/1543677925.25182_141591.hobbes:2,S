Just trying to be paranoid safe in module init code.  You can't unload a 
module with live objects
easily but in at least the case of force unloading of modules (in this 
case the cifs filesystem) is
apparently permitted by the kernel if you specify force and unless there 
is a way to autounmount
when someone forces you into your module exit routine (i.e. on rmmod 
<filesystemname.o> -f)
before all associated mounts are unmounted, I was thinking about whether 
the filesystem's module
init code should check if the filesystem module unloaded (from a slab 
perspective) cleanly but
couldn't think of an easy way to check unless I intentionally leave some 
/proc/fs/ entry around
when module unloading fails (and use the /proc/fs/cifs entry as a hint 
that module unloading was
not clean so don't even think about trying to do a module init on this 
filesystem).
