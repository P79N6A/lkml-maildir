As a language contstruct - if you don't need it, don't use it. It does
simplify/clean up a lot of definitions that have variable bit widths
depending on archetecture. I've already fought Kerberos libraries trying
to compile it as a 64 bit library - (IP addresses suddently went to 64 bits,
other "int" structures changed to 64 bits, portability was zip.)
Most of the fields that caused problems could easily have been delt with
if a "int var : 32" could have been used to create the types in the
various data structures.
As far as the library goes ... when I need it I'll use it. The code would
be much cleaner if I didn't have to make each expression a function call.
That can turn the code into lisp...
