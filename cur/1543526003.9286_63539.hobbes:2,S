Hi,

Does VM stand for Virtual Memory? Am I out of RAM/swap?
The machine is running Red Hat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.14), and has 128MB (ECC
PC-100) RAM, and a 128MB swap partition. Normally I have anywhere from 3 to
20MB RAM free, and about 2MB of swap used (126MB free).
This has happened three times now. I reset the box and all seems to go fine.
Thanks in advance for any help.
Cheers
Simon Garner
