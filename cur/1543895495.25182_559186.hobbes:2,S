good find.
Looking through intel-agp brings up a wart that I've been 
complaining about for a while.
Start looking for functions with '965' in them.
the first one you hit is the wonderfully named
'intel_i830_init_gtt_entries'.
Two thirds of that function no longer have anything to
do with an i830.  Instead of adding a intel_i965_init_gtt_entries,
this thing has grown into a monster dealing with three different
generations of hardware.
This results in tables like this..
static const struct agp_bridge_driver intel_i965_driver = {
       .owner                  = THIS_MODULE,
       .aperture_sizes         = intel_i830_sizes,
       .size_type              = FIXED_APER_SIZE,
       .num_aperture_sizes     = 4,
       .needs_scratch_page     = TRUE,
       .configure              = intel_i915_configure,
       .fetch_size             = intel_i9xx_fetch_size,
       .cleanup                = intel_i915_cleanup,
       .tlb_flush              = intel_i810_tlbflush,
       .mask_memory            = intel_i965_mask_memory,
       .masks                  = intel_i810_masks,
       .agp_enable             = intel_i810_agp_enable,
       .cache_flush            = global_cache_flush,
       .create_gatt_table      = intel_i965_create_gatt_table,
       .free_gatt_table        = intel_i830_free_gatt_table,
       .insert_memory          = intel_i915_insert_entries,
       .remove_memory          = intel_i915_remove_entries,
       .alloc_by_type          = intel_i830_alloc_by_type,
       .free_by_type           = intel_i810_free_by_type,
       .agp_alloc_page         = agp_generic_alloc_page,
       .agp_destroy_page       = agp_generic_destroy_page,
       .agp_type_to_mask_type  = intel_i830_type_to_mask_type,
so we use bits and pieces from 810, 830, 915, and throw in
some new 965 routines too.  Why is this a mess ?
Because it's non-trivial to just look at this table
and spot bugs like "wait, that 810 should be using 915"
without lots of staring at data sheets.
Additionally each time we twist these routines to cope with
an additional chipset, we risk breaking previous generations.
Having functions do ONE thing is a good thing, even if
it means having 15 of them that look similar.
The alternative of a single function that becomes a nest
of if's & switches is just horrible.
It could be that all of the above is actually pointing to
the correct routines.  It could also be that the codepaths
in those routines, as twisty as they are, are fine, and this
is just some normal bug, but hunting for it becomes a lot
harder when the code is this baroque.
