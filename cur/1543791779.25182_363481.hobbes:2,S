Obviously you missed the point that (depending on the compiler version,
options etc.) do_move_mount() and do_add_mount() can be inlined.
Hence stack frame size of do_mount is directly influenced by those two
functions. At least when I performed my "skin-deep" analysis of this
kernel stack overflow both functions were inlined in do_mount().
Stack consumptions of all other functions occurring in the backtrace
were moderate or due to the amount of inlined functions.
Just do_mount and its inlined friends use to put larger structures on
the stack that better should be allocated. There would not be any
performance impact for the user to allocate the structs.
