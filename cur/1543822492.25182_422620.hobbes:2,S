You publish the port to the uart layer and then do initialisation.
What if someone nips in and starts using the port between registering
it and initialising the spinlock?  (that's a general principle - for
any device driver, never publish the device interfaces until you've
completed all initialisation.)
Why not do the spinlock initialisation first?
