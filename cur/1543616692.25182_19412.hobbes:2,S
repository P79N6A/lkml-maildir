Denis,
This patch was a feeble attempt at fixing a real VM problem by masking what was
really going on.
There are many "better" solution than this old patch
AA has a great VM patch
Rik has an rmap patch that looks promising
and my latest "simple" fix is attached for 2.4.17 but should apply to 2.4.18-pre
Thanks for looking at this old one though.
Martin
BTW: w/ this patch you no longer need to Tame the OOM killer[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
