I tried your patch for Radeon framebuffer on kernel 2.4.21-pre7, it
works better than before, but still I have some problems:
the cursor is visible only at 8 bit depth, with 16 or 32 bit it just
disappears, and at 8 bit it is a big full scale rectangular cursor
(no underline).
I couldn't find a way to set the resolution at boot time (I use the
driver compiled in), I tried the following, all being ignored:
radeonfb:1024x768-8@60
radeon:1024x768-8@60
I am using an ugly fbset in a random boot script, but it just changes the
resolution for the first console. This is probably the biggest problem I
saw until now...
Finally dmesg says:
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 01:00.0
radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=12, xclk=20000 from BIOS
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30
radeonfb: ATI Radeon 9000 If DDR SGRAM 64 MB
radeonfb: DVI port no monitor connected
radeonfb: CRT port CRT monitor connected
                   ^^^
But I have an LCD on the CRT port, I saw some LCD support in radeonfb.c,
but perhaps it was only on DVI port.
I have a:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R250 If [Radeon 9000] (rev 01)
with 64Mb DDR on a PIII 500Mhz, Asus P3C2000 (i820 chipset) motherboard.
Thanks for your work.
