No, I checked it again. The kernel is all right.
I think I figured out the problem (at least mine...) I am using an old
RedHat 4.2 here and I had a link in /usr/include/scsi pointing to
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi. So I installed the kernel source to
/usr/src/linux and _after_  that I upgrated to glibc-2.1.1 using redhat's
6.0 version and glibc-devel-2.1.1-6 installs a certain files into
/usr/include/scsi namely scsi.h and sg.h ;-)
So kernel files are overwritten by this. Maybe you have done similar
things ... I've just removed the link an installed glibc-devel-2.1.1-6 and
the kernel again. I hope that's the only thing to adjust, and well I think
thats rather a workaround ...
However, why are there two scsi.h and sg.h ?
