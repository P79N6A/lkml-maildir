Great! Of course that won't help much if we get repeating "important"
events that aren't even interesting much less important, but it's worth
trying to printk only the important ones and leave the rest to netlink.
Note that currently we printk them all as KERN_DEBUG messages. Although
they aren't spewed to console, they still take up (lots of) space in the
printk buffer, and dmesg is still afflicted too...
