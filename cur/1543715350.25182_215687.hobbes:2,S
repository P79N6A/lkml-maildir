Subject: set termios from within line discipline

I am porting a 9bit serial protocol that requires the 9th bit to be high on 
the last transmitted byte, and low on the others.
What I tried to do was implement a line discipline that changes parity before 
each byte is transmitted, to get the proper 9th bit value.
But the problem is changing the parity from a line discipline.
This is what I do, when a parity change has to be made:
tty_wait_until_sent(dev->tty, 0);
if (signal_pending(current)) return -EINTR;
if (odd)
{
  tty->termios->c_cflag |= PARODD;
}
else
{
  tty->termios->c_cflag &= ~PARODD;
}
if (tty->driver.set_termios)
  tty->driver.set_termios(tty, &oldterm);
if (tty->ldisc.set_termios)
  tty->ldisc.set_termios(tty, &oldterm);
tty->driver.write(tty, 0, &byte, 1);
Two things,
1. when I use 'tcgetattr' from userspace, I don't see the changes made from 
within the line discipline
2. though I see that the parity changes now and then, the transmitted bytes 
don't always have the correct parity
What would be the preferred way to change termios flags from a line 
discipline?
Please also reply to my email address, since I'm not subscribed to the list.
