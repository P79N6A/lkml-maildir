(sorry, it indeed makes sense, since sched_jtime is on the order of
jiffies.)

if this is what is done by your patch, then we do not want to do this.
My patch does not give an advantage of CPU-intensive processes over that
of eg. 'vi'. Perhaps i'm misreading your patch, it's full of branches that
does not make the meaning very clear, cpu_jtime and sched_jtime are not
explained. Is sched_jtime the timestamp of the last schedule of this
process? And is cpu_jtime the number of jiffies spent on this CPU? Is
cpu_jtime cleared if we switch to another CPU?
