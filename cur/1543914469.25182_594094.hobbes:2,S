I have read the announcement from Ingo and after reading it I concluded
that it was good to see that Ingo had taken in consideration the feedback
from you and improved the schduler based on this.
And when I read that he removed a lot of stuff I smiled. This reminded
me of countless monkey aka code review sessions where I repeatedly do
like my childred and asks why so many times that the author realize that
something is not needed or no longer used.
The above were my impression after reading the announcement with
respect to your influence and that goes far beyond "two cleanups".
I bet many others read it roughly like I did.
And no - I did not go back and re-read it. So do not answering
by quoting the announcement or stuff like this.
Because that will NOT change what my first impression was.
So keep up the review - we get a better scheduler this way.
