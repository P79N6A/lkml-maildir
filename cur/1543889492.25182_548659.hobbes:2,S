Attached is the kernel module (compress-test) to test this LZO code.
Just compile this module against 2.6.22-rc2 with this LZO patch. Then
testing can be done as:
1- Mount DebugFS somewhere e.g:
mkdir /debug; mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug
2- Load the module and do:
cat /path/to/some_file > /debug/compress_test/compress
(/var/log/messages should show that compression was successful)
3- Then decompress this file as:
cat /debug/compress_test/decompress > /tmp/t
(/var/log/messages should show that decompression was successful)
4- For extra verification do:
diff /tmp/t /path/to/some_file   -- O/P must be empty
Thanks!
