This was a follow-up to the announcement of the Sb-live drivers on
Slashdot.org:
   To all those considering getting an SBLive, I'd strongly recommend
   going for a card based on the Trident 4dWave-NX chipset
   (www.hoontech.com makes and sells one). It's a really sweet chipset,
   and Trident released GPL kernel drivers for it (which will ship with
   the next version of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). It has
   4-speaker support, good 3d positional audio, all operations are done
   internally in 24 bit/48khz, S/PDIF digital output, etc. The Hoontech
   card has a 20bit/48khz codec, and even optical and coax plugs for
   digital output for plugging it into high-end recording equipment.
   Right now, since it was just released, Hoontech has eval pricing, so
   the card costs $19-$24 (depending on digital plugs) plus $14-$16 s/h
   from Korea. I'd say it's a much better card regardless of drivers, and
   having GPL ALSA drivers sure kicks ass.
   The problem with binary only (see
   
http://pmitros.mit.edu/binary-only.html
 during daylight hours) is that
   Creative is unlikely to still support those drivers 5 or 10 years from
   now. On the other hand, even source drivers break between releases.
   Binary drivers are almost guarenteed not to work from release to
   release (Linus has said so). Your hardware is likely not to work at
   all with modern software a few years from now, and force you to wait
   for Creative to update their drivers each time a new kernel comes out
   today.

That sounds pretty good, imho.
