OK. Someone mentioned wanting to do overlapping sets of CPUs. For
example, 3 groups, first can run on cpus 0 and 1, second 1 and 2,
third 2 and 0. However this in itself doesn't preculde the use of
sched-domains.
In the (hopefully) common case where there are disjoint partitions
_somewhere_, sched domains can do the job in a much better
way than task cpu affinities (better isolation, multiprocessor
balancing shouldn't break down).
Those users with overlapping CPU sets can then use task affinities
on top of sched domains partitions to get the desired result.
