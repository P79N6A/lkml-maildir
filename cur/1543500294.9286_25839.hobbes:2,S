Hi Jeff.

I would suggest you think about the context in which kassert would be
used before implementing the above in the kernel. Perhaps I can point
out some relevant issues that you appear to have overlooked:
 1. Whatever the assertion that failed, the kernel NEEDS to keep
    running. Therefore, an OOPS is usually NOT appropriate.
 2. You state that an "assertion failure is more than a debug
    statement" without providing any explanation for your claim.
    As I see it, and taking kassert in its purest way, its ONLY
    purpose is debugging, and it is thus ideal for KERN_DEBUG.
 3. As far as actually seeing the error reports are concerned,
    the majority of users would have NO idea what to do if some
    application started spewing "assertion failure" messages all
    over their screen, so using a reporting level that is often
    set up to spew all suchlike messages to all logged in users
    is not a particularly good idea.
 4. The way that I would see such a facility used is for users
    with enough interest to help with the kernel to set up their
    system such that KERN_DEBUG errors get logged to a specific
    file, which would then serve as a central repository for ALL
    kernel debugging messages.
    The default setting, used by the majority of the users (who have
    no interest in debugging Linux) being that suchlike messages are
    logged in either /var/log/messages or in /dev/null as preferred.
 5. The choice of '#ifndef NDEBUG' or '#ifdef DEBUG' matters, as the
    two forms have different implications. Personally, I believe the
    latter has the correct implication in the kernel context, but the
    former has the correct implication in an application context:
    '#ifndef NDEBUG' sayd "Disable debugging only if the variable
    NDEBUG is defined", thus implying that the normal case is WITH
    debugging.
    '#ifdef DEBUG' says "Enable debugging only if the variable DEBUG
    is defined", thus implying that the normal case will be without
    debugging.
 6. Whilst the format of the userland version is interesting, it is
    not necessarily a useful guide to the format the kernel version
    should take. Remember that both the circumstances of its use and
    the results thereof are considerably different.
For these reasons, and taking into account the various comments made
so far, I would suggest the following patch instead:
