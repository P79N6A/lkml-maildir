Hi all...
(sorry for the previous crap...)
My venerable dual PII box died and I am in the process of get a new
box.
My choice is this mobo (Asus PCDL)
http://www.asus.com/products/server/srv-mb/pc-dl/overview.htm
Any one in the list has one of these ? Opinions ?
I am interedted in the support for things like:
- AGP: i875
- FireWire: TI TSB43AB22A
- Promise PDC20378 Serial ATA
TIA.
