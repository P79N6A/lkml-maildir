Basically I can agree with this, although I'd like to avoid that we 
iterate too much over these steps, as it would too easily divert the 
discussion to other things, so I'd rather take smaller steps and keep the 
scope a bit broader.
Another point is the perfomance, which is not that important right now. 
I'm more interested in the general complexity, it's simply easier to 
optimize a simple design than a very complex design.
bye, Roman
