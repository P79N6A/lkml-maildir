Anything specific? It provides all kinds of neat tricks. For example,
if all your CD-ROMs devices are unloaded and you have module
autoloading, then to find all CD-ROMs on the system, you just do:
    opendir ("/dev/ide/cd");
    loop;
    opendir ("/dev/sr");
    loop;
and your directory scanning code knows that each and every entry
(besides "." and "..":-) is a Genuine CD-ROM[tm] that actually exists
on your system. No need to process a large directory, speculatively
opening device nodes to see if there's some hardware behind them.
