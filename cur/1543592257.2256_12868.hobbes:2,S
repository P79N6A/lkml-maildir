First of all, thanks very much for the work you are doing.  It really
is useful, and a good way to catch those very rare error cases that
would not otherwise be fixed.
I'm curious about this stack checker.  Does it check for a single
stack allocation >= 1024 bytes, or does it also check for several
individual, smaller allocations which total >= 1024 bytes inside
a single function?  That would be equally useful.
On a side note, does anyone know if the kernel does checking if the
stack overflowed at any time?  It is hard to use Dawson's tools to
verify call paths because of interrupts and such, but I wonder what
happens when the kernel stack overflows - OOPS, or silent corruption?
Cheers, Andreas
