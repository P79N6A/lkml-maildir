(My usual technique is use "gdb vmlinux" and "x/i 0x...." to do the 
lookup.) 
Unfortunately that doesn't narrow down what the kernel was actually 
trying to do at the time.  Clearly a set_pte; looks like someone is 
trying to create a writable mapping of an existing pte page.
Does "console=hvc0 earlyprintk=xen" on the kernel command line give any 
clue about how far it gets before crashing?
