It's a horrible example.
device-to-device copies sound like the ultimate thing. 
They suck. They add a lot of complexity and do not work in general. And,
if your "normal" usage pattern really is to just move the data without
even looking at it, then you have to ask yourself whether you're doing
something worthwhile in the first place.
Not going to happen.
