There are a few main reasons.
- There is no user-mode API for initiating OSD commands. Such a subsystem
  would be hundredfold bigger then the mkfs code submitted. I think it would be
  hard and stupid to maintain a complex user-mode API just for creating
  a couple of objects and writing a couple of on disk structures.
- I intend to refactor the code further to make use of more super.c services,
  so to make this addition even smaller. Also future direction of raid over
  multiple objects will make even more kernel infrastructure needed which
  will need even more user-mode code duplication.
- I anticipate problems that are not yet addressed in this body of work
  but will be in the future, mainly that a single OSD-target (lun) can
  be shared by lots of FSs, and a single FS can span many OSD-targets.
  Some central management is much easier to do in Kernel.

This OSD-based file system is dependent on the open-osd initiator library
code that I've submitted for inclusion for 2.6.29. It has been sitting
in linux-next for a while now, and has not been receiving any comments
for the last two updated patchsets I've sent to scsi-misc/lkml. However
it has not yet been submitted into Jame's scsi-misc git tree, and James
is the ultimate maintainer that should submit this work. I hope it will
still be submitted into 2.6.29, as this code is totally self sufficient
and does not endangers or changes any other Kernel subsystems.
(All the needed ground work was already submitted to Linus since 2.6.26)
So why should it not?
Once the open-osd initiator library is accepted this file system
could be accepted. I was hoping as a 2.6.30 time frame. (One Kernel
after the open-osd library)

Thank you dear Andrew for your most valuable input.
I will constify all the const needed code. will fix the global name space
litter, will inline the macros and lower case the inlines. Will remove
the typedefs.
I will reply to individual patches, I have a couple of questions. But
all your comments are right and I will take care of them.
When, if, all is fixed, through which tree/maintainer can exofs be submitted?
Thanks
Boaz
