You can make the same argument for either implementation of MS_ASYNC. 
And there's at least one way in which the "submit IO now" version can be
used meaningfully --- if you've got several specific areas of data in
one or more mappings that need flushed to disk, you'd be able to
initiate IO with multiple MS_ASYNC calls and then wait for completion
with either MS_SYNC or fsync().  That gives you an interface that
corresponds somewhat with the region-based filemap_sync();
filemap_fdatawrite(); filemap_datawait() that the kernel itself uses.

It's very much visible, just from a performance perspective, if you want
to support "kick off this IO, I'm going to wait for the completion
shortly."  If that's the interpretation of MS_ASYNC, then the app is
basically saying it doesn't want the writeback mechanism to be idle
until the writes have completed, regardless of whether it's a block
device or an NFS file or whatever underneath.
But whether that's a legal use of MS_ASYNC really depends on what the
standard is requiring.  I could be persuaded either way.  Uli?
Does anyone know what other Unixen do here?
