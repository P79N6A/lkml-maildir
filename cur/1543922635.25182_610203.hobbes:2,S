Sounds better.  I was hoping somebody was going to come forward with an 
alternative that sounded better than interleave_over_allowed.

That sounds reasonable, it will simply be a wrapper around 
is_interleave_over_allowed() or what we're now calling is_spread_user().

For setting current->il_next, both cases work but yours will be better 
balanced for the next interleaved allocation.  I'll apply it to my 
patchset.
Thanks for the review.
