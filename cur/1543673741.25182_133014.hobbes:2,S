please beg Javier to split up his patch.  He sends me a _huge_ patch 
with tons of changes each time.  If I object to one thing, we spin in 
another huge-patch loop... :/
Sending me 20, 50, 100 patches to the same file is ok.  Even encouraged.

We need firmware upload, and, firmware _should_ be uploaded from userspace.
All someone needs to do is actually write the code for their driver to 
receive firmware from userspace, and the rest is easy.  A working 
technical solution is obvious, it just needs interested parties to 
implement.
We can upload firmware from initrd, if no boot device is available at 
the time.
