Subject: Problem with shutdown(fd, 1) on tcp sockets in 2.2

tcp_shutdown in net/ipv4/tcp.c begins with:
void tcp_shutdown(struct sock *sk, int how)
{
	/*	We need to grab some memory, and put together a FIN,
	 *	and then put it into the queue to be sent.
	 *		Tim MacKenzie(tym@dibbler.cs.monash.edu.au) 4 Dec '92.
	 */
	if (!(how & SEND_SHUTDOWN))
		return;
It looks to me like this misinterprets the how value. how == 1 should
mean no more sends, but here SEND_SHUTDOWN is 2 and so some shutdown
calls on tcp sockets will get wrongly ignored.
