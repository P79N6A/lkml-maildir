I have taken to writing a LOT of comments myself, lately.  I think it is
more to do with the idea that I like to scan comments for keywords, so I
can jump around the code very easily.
I feel that if I can just skim comments, I should understand how the code
works.  I know many people that barely comment their code, and I have heard
(at least once) that my code is generally easy to follow.
just my $0.02
ON-TOPIC: I am rewriting my pset patch to simplify and clean up a lot of
bad code brought forward through revision after revision, and hopefully
submit it for 2.3 when it is time.
