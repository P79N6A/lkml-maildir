Correct.

Yes, that matters to vsmp, which has ... 4K node cache-lines.
Note that there's already CONFIG_X86_INTERNODE_CACHE_BYTES which is set 
properly on vsmp.
So ... something like the commit below?

Subject: [PATCH] x86, tlb flush_data: replace per_cpu with an array
Impact: micro-optimization, memory reduction
On x86_64 flush tlb data is stored in per_cpu variables. This is
unnecessary because only the first NUM_INVALIDATE_TLB_VECTORS entries
are accessed.
This patch aims at making the code less confusing (there's nothing
really "per_cpu") by using a plain array. It also would save some memory
on most distros out there (Ubuntu x86_64 has NR_CPUS=64 by default).
[ Ravikiran G Thirumalai also pointed out that the correct alignment
  is ____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp, so that there's no
  bouncing on vsmp. ]
