No, please also answer to the list, I'm interested in the answer, too.
- Where can somebody find information about net-pf-x?
  Is it possible to autoload af_packet.o with some net-pf-x?
  Where can I see, what is the kernel looking for, so I'm able to insert a
	line into /etc/conf.modules?
  Can I load something for "char-major-14-16" ??
  crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root      14,  16 Nov 15  1997 /dev/mixer1
	Only "char-major-14" works for me...
Thanks,
	Rob
