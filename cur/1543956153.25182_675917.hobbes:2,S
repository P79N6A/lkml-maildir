Yes that is an expected result.  We have no way to force the pool to
shrink when pages are in-use.  When a request is made to redoce the pool
below the number of in-use pages, we move the pages to surplus.  While
this does temporarily violate the overcommit cap, it does provide the
most utility as those pages will be returned to the buddy at the
earliest oppotunity.
I suspect the documenation could do with a little clarification.
