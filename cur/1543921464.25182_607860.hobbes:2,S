Subject: [PATCH 10/11] KVM: Fix local apic timer divide by zero
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Kevin Pedretti <kevin.pedretti@gmail.com>
kvm_lapic_reset() was initializing apic->timer.divide_count to 0,
which could potentially lead to a divide by zero error in
apic_get_tmcct().  Any guest that reads the APIC's CCR (current count)
register before setting DCR (divide configuration) would trigger a divide
by zero exception in the host kernel, leading to a host-OS crash.
This patch results in apic->timer.divide_count being initialized to
2 at reset, eliminating the bug (DCR=0 at reset, meaning divide by 2).
