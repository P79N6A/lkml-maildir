Yes, that is a bad patch, I missed part of what the i2c_info function was 
doing. It looks like this isn't going to be able to be solved with a 
simple patch.
For the time being if you need to remove/reload the modules I'd try using 
'rmmod' instead of 'modprobe -r' - you might be able to avoid the oops by 
removing modules one by one in a strict order.
If that's not feasible I'd stick with the -mm4 tree or pre-rc2 until the 
-mm changes go into mainline.
