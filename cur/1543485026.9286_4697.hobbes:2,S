Hi there ! 
I have here at home some problems with linux on my computer . 
I´m using the distribution from suse , version 6.0 , kernelversion 2.2.1
. 
i have already asked in several mailing lists , but as the only result I
got your mailing list adress . 
Okay , to my problems : The kernel v2.2.1 works really fine , all
devices seem to work fine . 
But sometimes keyboard and trackball stop working , and the system runs
on for some minutes . 
The only possibility after this is to make a cold reboot . 
The consequence is missing data . Thats not fine !
At other times the system simply freezes . Nothing goes more .
Even a poweroff via the poweroff on ATX mainboards does not work ( I
have posted this already to the mainboard manufacturer - hope that they
answer )
A cold reboot works ( this would be really serious ) 
I´m not able to say if wether this is an application that causes the
crash or a kernel error . 
One idea in this direction is netscape v4.5 , that seems to be a little
buggy . 
Or possibly StarOffice V5 , but viewed from statistics , StarOffice was
only at one crash running in the background . 
And I should analyze the behaviour of X11AMP . this prog seems to bee a
little obvious . There are four x11amp processes in the process list .
why ?
Okay , here´s a list of my used hardware . I don´t know wether you need
it or not ,  so there´s it listed .
Mainboard :Gigabyte GA686DLX + aic7880 uwscsi onboard 
memory 	  : 128 megs of sdram , pc-66
processors : P2 , 
  : CPU1 ID:0652  Patch ID : none  ,, Core : Deschutes
  : CPU2 ID:0634  Patch ID : 0033  ,, Core : Klamath
Graphics : diamond fireGL 1000 pro agp 
network : a ne2000 clone by realtek : rtl8029 pci 
sound : sb awe64 
2 harddisks . one uw-scsi by ibm ( dcas(?) 4.3 gb, one ide, also ibm 4.3
gb.
scsi - cdrom and scsi cdwriter 
and a zip drive on paralell port 
keyboard and trackball are both connected to ps/2 ( keyboard via a din
=>ps/2 adapter ) 
Okay , I don´t know what information else you need . It a little to much
to post my configuration . 
I hope someone can deal with this kind of problem , because i have no
more idea what can cause this . 
One idea was that both CPU´s have problems working together, because
they have different ID´s and patch level .
But I´m not a chipdesigner from intel .
Okay , so long goodbye
an thanks for your help
bye
