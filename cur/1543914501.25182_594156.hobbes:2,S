So you want a zero mapping at a particular address?  So the vaddr and
the memsz are set, but offset and filesz are zero?

Well, you could make the p_offset the same as the first segment with a
non-zero filesz.  That should satisfy the elf loader, though it might
still confuse things.
Why can't you create this mapping at runtime?
