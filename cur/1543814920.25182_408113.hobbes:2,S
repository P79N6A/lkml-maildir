I found why it didn't work on my PC before. I wrote that I not only enabled
for every PCI id, but removed the following check:
      if (likely(!asus_hides_ac97))
                return;
This was the bit which made it work. After putting some debugging
information it turned out that asus_hides_ac97_lpc was called *before*
asus_hides_ac97_device, so the asus_hides_ac97 remained 0 in that check.
As far as I know this problem appears on all VT8237 boards (I found in
several forums), I suggest to completely drop the asus_hides_ac97_device
function and the above if clause.
See the debug outputs:
Inside asus_hides_ac97_lpc
asus_hides_ac97=0
device: 0x3227
PCI: enabled onboard AC97/MC97 devices
Inside asus_hides_ac97_device
vendor 0x1043
device 0x3227
