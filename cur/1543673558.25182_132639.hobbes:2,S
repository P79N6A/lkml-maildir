I think what we're going to do there is to just remove the darn warning. 
Only enable it when a special CONFIG_IRQ_DEBUG has been set.
So people can turn that on when they have specific problems.  Yes, it will
get false positives, but it should enable us to diagnose the source of
irq-related lockups amongst the noise.
So let's leave things as they are at present, and when we're satisfied that
most drivers are doing mostly the right thing, go add the config option.
