That was intended. Better fail to compile than break on boot.

ok.

Ok. However, this is a general issue with CONFIG_DISCONTIG being on and 
CONFIG_NUMA being off. ppc64 will be fine for CONFIG_NUMA but not for 
CONFIG_NUMA being off and CONFIG_DISCONTIG being on.
Would you put Dave Hansen's fix in that he posted in this thread?
Seems that we will be evolving finally into a situation in which
all of this will work itself out again.
Another solution would be to s/CONFIG_NUMA/CONFIG_DISCONTIG/ in the slab
allocator until the issues has been worked through.
Here is Dave's patch again:
=====================================================================
I think I found the problem.  Could you try the attached patch?
As I said before FLATMEM is really referring to things like the
mem_map[] or max_mapnr.
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES is what gets turned on for DISCONTIG or for
NUMA.  We'll slowly be removing all of the DISCONTIG cases, so
eventually it will merge back to be one with NUMA.
