I beg to differ. RAMFS is an instance of a filesystem which uses an
unsorted linear list of entries which is automatically repacked when you
delete a file.
You may also have filesystems which are only partially sorted. The
dcache is for instance organised as a hashtable with multiple entries
per bucket...
