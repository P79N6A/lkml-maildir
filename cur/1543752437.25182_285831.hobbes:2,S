If your socket works like that, you need to handle that by using a timer
yourself.  It normally only affects removal rather than insertion.

Different cards behave differently.  I suspect you have yet another
quirky card.

There isn't any 1ms wait in mmc_setup().

People are nervous about SD support - the SD forum has been traditionally
rather closed, and there is the perception that a SD card driver may not
go down well.  I have even heard rumours of patent issues/IP issues in
this area, and I don't wish to get stung.
However, that said, the situation has improved recently - we've gone from
no documentation to limited documentation.  However, this documentation
still isn't sufficient to do the job - eg, the SD formats for the CID
and CSD registers remain completely undocumented.
