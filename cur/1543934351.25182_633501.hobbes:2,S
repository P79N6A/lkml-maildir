ISTR that it won't save very much code though ... the Linux USB
stack structures all its enumeration logic around hubs.

This is probably the right thing to do.  Correct me if I'm wrong,
but USB-IF recently put out some specs about "embedded hosts" which
basically boil down to saying you can adopt the same functionality
restrictions that used to be OTG-only.  Which is why now there are
embedded developers who'd like this option.  :)
