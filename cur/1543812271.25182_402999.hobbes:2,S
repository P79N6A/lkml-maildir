I'll try it, although I don't think I'll get any data on the problem.
The unmodified DSDT (bios 1.11) lacks an S3 sleep object, so I had to
modify the DSDT even to get S3 to sleep at all.  See
<
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3534>
 for that discussion.
In additional comment #4 there (2004-10-14), you said:
  The root cause of [the missing S3 object] failure is that linux is
  using element in
  const char      *acpi_gbl_sleep_state_names[ACPI_S_STATE_COUNT] =
  {
	  "\_S0_",
	  "\_S1_",
	  "\_S2_",
	  "\_S3_",
	  "\_S4_",
	  "\_S5_"
  };
  to call acpi_get_sleep_type_data, but your box define _S3 under the
  device PNP0A03. So, the evaluating \_S3 will fail.
  The workaround in DSDT is to change _S3 to \_S3_ .
  We can fix it in acpi driver soon.
It looks unchanged in a recent acpi driver
(drivers/acpi/utilities/utglobal.c, line 170, 2.6.16-rc2), so I
suspect S3 won't happen with the vanilla DSDT.
(Sorry, I was away for 10 days and also just saw your info requests in
the bugme #5989.)
