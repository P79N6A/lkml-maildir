How can you tell? The binary blobs may have a glitch, flaw, bug, that
makes them write more-or-less random values to random memory locations,
thereby inadvertently killing the functionality of other modules (such
as the ipv6 tunnel).
If the bug happens without the blobs, _then_ one may start figuring out
what (non-binary) modules may cause interaction problems with the ipv6
tunnel (or if it's the tunnel module itself).
