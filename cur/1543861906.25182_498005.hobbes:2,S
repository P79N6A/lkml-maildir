I think we should recognize --args-linux while loading elf image and
all the processing we do for loading linux elf vmlinux should be done
under that option (The way i386 does). This will help if down the line
kexec ia64 loader allows loading some other elf images where one needs
to prepare elf boot notes (--args-elf). 
Eric is the best person to comment on this. He has got all the background
about these options.
Thanks
