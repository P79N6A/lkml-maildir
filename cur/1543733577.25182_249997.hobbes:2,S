No, absolutely not.  I suggested you remove the remaining ASIC-specific
bits from pci_dma.c, namely the decision when to use direct translation
and where to use ates, and the flags and only have a single mapping
routine calling into pcibr code with a prototype ala:
dma_addr_t picbr_dma_map(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned long phys, size_t size);

Isn't the pcibr_ prefix enough?  This isn't something that would hold up
merging, but I think the additional level is a little silly.

What about adding an union of both _typed_ pointers so you don't need
to cast everytime?
Anyway, it looks like we're making nice progress, thanks for the work.
