Only if one breaks it by making extensions in an inappropriate way.
This is not a fault of POSIX. POSIX usually allows a lot of sane ways
to introduce extensions. There are usually valid interoperability
arguments for behavior prescribed by POSIX. It is really not one of
those standards where you want to ignore every second word because
it is obviously nothing but committee nonsense.

You are reversing the argument. If additional streams are introduced
inappropriately by extending the semantics of S_IFREG files, POSIX
requires cp to lose the data. Your proposal would then make this loss
of additional stream data dependent on an environment variable that
is already in wide use. If it was set by accident, the data would be
lost.
Besides, copying xattrs is usually permitted (POSIX.1-2004, XCU cp):
# If the implementation provides additional or alternate access control
# mechanisms (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
# Section 4.4, File Access Permissions), their effect on copies of files
# is implementation-defined.
It is also permitted to add other S_IFXXX types and then let cp act
in an implementation-defined manner on them (cf. my earlier message
<413E40D1.nailFBI11XFML@pluto.uni-freiburg.de>).
The 'standardized' data loss would only occur if the standardized type
of regular file, S_IFREG, was abused. This would really not be a fault
of POSIX.

Sure, but it is not the preferred method of adding features. In
addition, most of the existing POSIXLY_CORRECT influences are
nothing but cosmetical details in comparison to copying/not
copying stream data.
