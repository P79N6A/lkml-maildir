I could use the same thing in Coda, we have large private memory
mappings that are backed by a file which isn't always up-to-date. But we
can make it so by applying the logged modifications. If there is some
'memory pressure' signal we could apply the log and remap the memory to
reduce swap usage.
On the other hand, applying the logged modifications generates a lot of
write activity which could push the system over the edge, so the current
method of having a large amount of swap available is probably more
reliable. Otherwise we'll get the whole OOM killer debate again (the
pre-OOM signaller?).
