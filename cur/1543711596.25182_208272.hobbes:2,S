Not all of them. Some are RAID-5.

IIRC, even a RAID-5 dm target is on its way to mainline and it was called
something like "the last step to obsolete md". So the userspace approach
seems the way to go.
That leaves me with the following questions:
- The kernel 2.4 code detects ATARAIDs by usage of deep kernel knowledge
about the specific harddisk (depending on the phase of the moon, it uses
head/sect/cyl or LBA). Is all of this info available to userspace?
- Would an EVMS plugin or a simple script calling dmsetup be the way to
go? If I go the dmsetup route, is there any chance to get partition
detection on top of the ATARAID for free (by calling another dm tool)?
