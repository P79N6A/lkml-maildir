I'd love to just blame the BIOS, but we've definitely had our own share of
bugs too. NMI makes all the fast system call etc stuff much more
"exciting", and we've several times had code that does actually disable
interrupts for a long time - which may be exceedingly impolite, but then
the NMI watchdog makes it a fatal error rather than something that is just
a nuisanse.
Of course, our own bugs we can fix (and hopefully we have done so - many
people _do_ obviously use the NMI watchdog as-is), so yes, in that sense 
BIOS (and hardware) bugs end up being a special case.
