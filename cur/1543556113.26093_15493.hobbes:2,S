I  reported this a few weeks ago or so, it seems that HP 7/14's are not exactly
standard.  First is the proprietory tape size.  Second is that the drive doesn't
support locking the tape in, but reports it as possible.  At least, that's what i
gather from Jens's posting.
To be honest, I'm not sure the drives are worth fixing <grin>  Unreliable media,
unreliable tape drives.  I've got two dead out of 10, in under a year.  And half a
dozen tapes or so.  Plus, under 2.2.17+ide, the tape drive wouldn't restore tapes.
Something weird about the tape drive again.  Had to boot up under plain 2.2.17 to
read my tapes.
