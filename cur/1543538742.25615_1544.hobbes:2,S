Sorry about the seriousness comment... I wasn't trying to be snotty... You
guys really are the best in the world and deserve more credit than you all
get.
I believe what I was writing is...
int main () {
	int file;
	int stats;
	file = open("/dev/hdd", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
	ioctl(file, CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY, & stats);
	if (stats && CDC_SELECT_DISC)
	printf("Success!\n");
	else
	printf("<DOH!> Something went wrong\n");
	return 0;
	}
I always get the same result no cd-changer support is found.  This was not
the case with 2.2.14.  I am assuming that CDC_SELECT_DISC is correct.  I
am not at my machine where I wrote this code so it may not be what I
actually have.
My CD-Changer is a NEC 8x4 disc changer and the vendor string is correctly
detected.  Could this be because I have a burner in the first IDE
chain /dev/hdb.  My changer is /dev/hdd.  I know that I have written code
that gets messed up on an assumption that assumes too much based on order
of inputs.  (Assembler I implemented...)
Just a thought..
Anyway thanks, your response was much quicker than I had hoped.
