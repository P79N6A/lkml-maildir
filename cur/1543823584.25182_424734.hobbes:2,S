Is there any interest in being able to deal with AIX's LVM and/or JFS/JFS2
(probably only read-only)?  If so, what level of support would be needed
to make it useful?
(Personally, being able to deal with it on a read-only basis for forensics
work would be useful - currently there's no really good way to deal with
an AIX system in a forensically sound manner, because 'importvg' and
friends have a tendency to scribble on the disks....)
Sanest way to approach it would probably be a mostly-userspace that
grovels out the LVM data and creates a device-mapper target.  ISTR there
was such a beast for the EVMS code, but I haven't gone digging for it yet.
