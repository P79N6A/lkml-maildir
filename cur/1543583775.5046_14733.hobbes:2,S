HWCACHE_ALIGN does not guarantee a certain byte alignment. And
additionally it's not even guaranteed that kmalloc() uses that
HWCACHE_ALIGN.
Uhci is broken, not my slab code ;-)

I looked at it, and there are 2 problems that make it virtually
impossible to integrate kmem_cache_alloc() with pci memory alloc without
a major redesign:
* pci_alloc_consistent returns 2 values, kmem_cache_alloc() only one.
This one would be possible to work around.
* the slab allocator heavily relies on the 'struct page' structure, but
it's not guaranteed that it exists for pci_alloced memory.
I'd switch to pci_alloc_consistent with some optimizations to avoid
wasting a complete page for each DMA header. (I haven't seen Johannes
patch, but we discussed the problem 6 weeks ago and that proposal was
the end of the thread)
