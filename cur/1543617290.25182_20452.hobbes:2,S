See that dynamic hosts are also added to the list and *never* removed
from it (even when the host is unregistered). With that behaviour your
unique number functions would be an overkill because we must never
free host nubers.
I suggest these changes:
    max_scsi_host initialized in scsi_host_no_init.
    max_scsi_host never decremented.
That would fix the problem that I reported.
Than (cosmetic):
    rename next_scsi_host to count_scsi_hosts (or num_scsi_hosts)
because it actually just counts the number of registered scsi hosts.
The current name for that variable is confusing...
