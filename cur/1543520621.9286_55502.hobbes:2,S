O.K. After your and Alans objections I probably have to get rid of my
separate namespace ;-(
How do I do the SYSV shm stuff then? On creation I could grab the
first superblock and create the object there. But on removal I rely on
the fs unlink function through do_unlink. How do I get the right path
for the plain unlink call? You do not propose to code the location
into the kernel, don't you?
Any advice welcome
