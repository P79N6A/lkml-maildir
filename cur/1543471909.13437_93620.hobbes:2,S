Subject: Problems booting with Kernel 2.0.36

I have one machine on which it is not possible to boot the Kernel 2.0.36.
I already mentioned this behaviour with Development Kernels. I don't know
which Development Kernel version it occured, but the Kernel 2.1.43 seems
to have the same Problem: The kernel boots, but it doesn't run init, nor
it prints out an error message. The machine on which the problem exists is
a Siemens-Nixdorf PCD-5T with the D808 mainboard (Pentium 60 MHz, Intel
Mercury Chipset, EISA). It doesnt matter whether I boot from HD or via
Root-NFS.
Is there a solution for this Problem or is it a hardware problem? I
already tried various kernel versions (including 2.0.37pre) and different
configurations. I get always this strange behaviour.
