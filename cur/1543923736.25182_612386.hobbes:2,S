Exactly. It's not that we care about trying to protect a system that 
really needs to use MMCFG - once you really *really* need it, you're 
screwed if it doesn't work.
But currently 99% of all systems will never need it, and for the broken 
platforms, that's a nice round 100%. So if we make code not use MMCFG by 
default, and you have to enable it for just those device drivers that 
really want it and care, you automatically avoid all the broken hardware, 
with no real downsides.
