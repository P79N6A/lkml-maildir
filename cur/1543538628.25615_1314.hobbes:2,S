Hi,
This is against -pre6...
Mostly comment changes.
Compiles.
Other changes:
*  priority decrement back to original
*  Quintela noticed me that since shrink_mmap may sleep the situation
may
   have improved after call even if nothing was freed.
Note:
* Not tested yet - I have some problems with the list based aging
(another patch).
  (want to stay on this release until I understand why)
