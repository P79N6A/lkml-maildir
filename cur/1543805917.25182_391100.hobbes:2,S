Lee's problem now seems to be fixed with my rcu-rt-flush-list patch.
So, atleast for now we can keep that issue aside.

It does. However I didn't see any degradation running kernbench
on a 4-way box a few months ago when I had originally written
this patch. It would be nice if someone from SGI can give
this a spin on a really big machine.
It is not as if we didn't have costly operations. Under memory
pressure, we would probably have been acquiring the file_count_lock
quite often. That lock is now gone. That said, I would like to
get a lazy percpu counter implementation done at some point
in time. So far, I have just kept the things simple.

That is hopefully fixed by my rcu-batch-tuning patch. I tested it using
a program that does open()/close() of /dev/null in a tight
loop. [x86_64 3.6GHz]

I declared it static. Isn't that sufficient ?

Where ? All proc functions are wrapped in #ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS and that
is what I have done. What am I missing here ?
Thanks
