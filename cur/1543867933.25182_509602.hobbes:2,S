Hi,
I am sorry, I was not clear enough - when I was talking about adding
cobalt_buttons_open/close I was not asking you to add a misc device to
the driver. I was talking about setting up open() and close() methods
in input_dev structure. These methods are called by input core when
first (or last) user opens or closes one of input interfaces, such as
/dev/input/eventX, /dev/input/jsX, etc and so it is naturally to
start/stop polling device from these functions.
Does this make sense?
