- Xen is currently not supported by the kernel Debian Installer uses (though 
work is being done to change that.
- KVM AFAIK requires hardware support that I don't have.
- QEMU is completely useless because of its slow speed without the (also out 
of tree) kqemu module, which does not work when the host system is x86_64 
[1]. Also, I very much prefer the VirtualBox user interface over what qemu 
has to offer.
- I've actually used VMWare for a long time (licenced), but stopped after 
the 5 series stopped working with current kernels and around that time 
VirtualBox became available as an alternative.
Hope that explains.
