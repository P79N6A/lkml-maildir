But the prefetch code tries to avoid prefetching when the disk is otherwise
busy (or it should - we discussed that a bit a while ago).
Sorry, I'm not trying to be awkward here - I think that nobbling prefetch
when there's a lot of CPU activity is just the wrong thing to do and it'll
harm other workloads.
