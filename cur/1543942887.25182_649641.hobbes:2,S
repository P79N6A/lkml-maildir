actually, the way i solved it for qemu+KVM+paravirt was to just turn off 
this rather silly check in the serial driver if inside a paravirt guest. 
When we are emulated then the serial 'hardware' is totally reliable and 
we should just trust it. That way i never dropped a single bit of kernel 
log output again.
