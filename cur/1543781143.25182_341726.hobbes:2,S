It also occurs to me that another reason for the disconnect between x86 
desktop/server and embedded on this point is the lack of ACPI.  We want 
to do things analogous to the power management performed by ACPI, but 
entirely in Linux, so we need to expose some of those low-level machine 
resources to our power management software.  In many cases those power 
management decisions do not revolve around the question of the MHz at 
which the CPU is to run.  Embedded Linux system power management exists 
for many of the same reasons ACPI exists.
