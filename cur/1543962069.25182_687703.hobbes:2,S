yes, it's something which has been disappearing since use of bk then git.
It would be impratical and useless to post everything during the merge
window now, but if we can get everyone to pass through linux-next, the
posts will be evenly distributed and it would make sense to require
everyone to post their changes to the list at the same time. Right now,
some developers already always post their changes. Jeff, Greg and
Bartlomiej come to mind, and I must say that I'm always interested in
performing a quick look, just in case something really obvious catches
my attention (which never happens).
