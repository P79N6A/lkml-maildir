even if you don't need synchronization you pay for it anyway, since you will have
to use the pthread version of libc that is reentrant. Moreover many calls (i.e.
accept) are "scheduling points" for pthreads, whenever you call them the runtime
will perform quite a bit of bookeeping.
it is instructive to use a profiler on your application and see what happens when
you use pthreads...

If your application uses lots of memory than I agree, Apache only uses a tiny
amount of RAM per instance though, so I don't think that that is my case.
