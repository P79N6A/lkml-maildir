It is set.  It is also set in the default config, so plently of people
are running with a broken sysfs tree.
I assume we agree that even if that's set, the tree should not be
outright broken like it is (the compatability mode should actually be
compatable, ie, work, right? :-)  Given that, is my patch correct?
What was there (plugging the old 'dev' arg into the new call's
'parent' makes no sense) is clearly wrong.
And it's clear my pacth is incomplete, as it doesn't correct the
device entries for the other entries.
