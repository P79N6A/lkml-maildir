Hi.
I've a problem with my server/router, that I've seen on
various kernels. currently I'm running 2.4.21, but I've
seen the problem on 2.4.20 and 2.5.70, too.
I'm using a 3com 3c509 ISA ethernet card.
When this server stays a longer time (about one night, 12 hours)
without network-traffic, it seems like the whole network-interface
falls into a very deep sleep. It's very hard to wake the machine
up.
Today it was _very_ hard. First I tried to reach the internet
through this machine (it's a router), but it didn't work.
Every packet was thrown away by the router.
Then I tried to login via ssh into the machine, but I got
no response. Then I tried to ping the machine. All packages
got lost. But after a few minutes of pinging, suddenly the
machine responded in normal speed. From now on ssh and
routing was possible too.
It's like I have to tickle the machine a bit, before its
network-interface wakes up and I'm able to transmit some
packages.
I've no idea for the reason.
Thank you for every help.
