This seems a bit over-kill for buffer management no?  The only large 
header seems to be cr_hdr_head and the blowup comes from utsinfo string 
data (which could easily be moved out to be in it's own CR_HDR_STRING 
blocks).
Wouldn't it be easier to use stack-local storage than balancing the 
cr_hbuf_get/put routines?
