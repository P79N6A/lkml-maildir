OK. First the standard probing. Nothing unusual.

Then the "<F7>usbdevfs".

It seems most likely that this keyboard is broken.
Instead of 0xa1 (f release) you get 0xab (\ release).
By some coincidence 0xab is f release in untranslated scancode set 2.
(But you are in translated scancode set 2, otherwise the other letters
would also have produced different codes.)
Could you try to run "showkey -s" on the console under 2.4.*?
Hit and release the f a few times. Type <F7>usbdevfs.
Just a broken key is something I have seen lots of times.
Since for most operating systems make codes are important
while break codes (other than those for Shift, Ctrl, Alt)
are not, a key with broken release code is usually harmless.
This case seems interesting because, if I understand you correctly,
the f in itself is not always broken, but this error occurs after
a particular sequence of keystrokes.
