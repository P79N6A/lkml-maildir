While we're on that subject, did you take a look at my original mail?
The intent with that patch was to allow system policy to state all new
VCs are UTF-8-enabled by default. I feel that in 2007 this should be the
default setting.
Would it therefore be possible to have
   vc->vc_utf = some_default;
where some_default comes maybe from a sysctl or some other configurable
source? Or maybe even have a compiletime option?
This would get around many bugs. For example, on boot, "unicode_start"
can only set utf8 mode on the existing VCs 1 to 6. If X11 fails to
start, debian nicely runs me the XKeepsCrashing program, which offers to
show me logs and the like. It reads the locale, en_GB.UTF-8 and
determines we're in UTF-8 mode, so outputs Unicode linedrawing
characters for dialogs. Unfortunately, we're on VC7 which doesn't have
UTF-8 mode turned on, so much mess results.
It would be nice if the kernel's default UTF-8 mode for new VCs could be
synched to whatever local policy was regarding locale.
