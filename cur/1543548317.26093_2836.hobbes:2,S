   Then, there is another issue for physically tagged cache system in the
   function memory.c:break_cow.  It calles flush_cache_page(vma,
   address).  For physically tagged cache system, we need __physical
   address__ here.  Currently, the implementation of SH-4 version of
   flush_cache_page(vma, address) takes the physicall address from PTE.
   However, at this point, PTE is not set for new_page, so, it doesn't
   flush the cache for new_page, but the one for old_page.
PTE is not set for new_page at this point, the sequence is:
	flush_page_to_ram(new_page);
	flush_cache_page(vma, address);
	establish_pte(vma, address, page_table, pte_mkwrite(pte_mkdirty(mk_pte(new_page, vma->vm_page_prot))));
establish_pte happens after flush_cache_page, establish_pte
is what change the PTE over to new_page.
Maybe you are looking at some very old 2.3.x kernel version
which had the order changed?
