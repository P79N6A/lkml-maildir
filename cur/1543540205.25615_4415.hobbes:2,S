Just because so many (2 or 3) people have mentioned this to me I'll reply
to it shortly.
The problem I have with /opt is I'm not used to it yet.  I'd have to put
it on it's own partition just like /usr, /home, and /var.  I don't have
any feeling for how big /opt should be and I usually totally just forget
about it.
I'm building a new system now, I'm going to attempt to make use of /opt
for larger, self-contained packages.  BUT /opt is going to be a symlink to
/usr/local (take that FHS).  At least now I'll get a little more used to
using /opt.
Boy, I can't think of one thing to say that'll make this relevent to the
kernel.
