No it shouldn't. The error is happening on the unit side and not on the
host side of the bus. Thus it is correct that the host is *not*
reporting an error (which is true) but only the CD-ROM unit.

I'm aware of all of that. By pure chance I have a machine with an OSB4
sitting on my desk for a couple of days. May be I can find a defect
CD-ROM to test it with my driver and see if it manages to recover from
errors like these. Hopefully, the PCI tracer gives some more insight.
Ciao,
