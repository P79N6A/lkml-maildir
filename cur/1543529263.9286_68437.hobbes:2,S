One obvious use of this is in detecting configuration clashes,
and for that reason, I'd like to see versions of both
/proc/ioports and /proc/interrupts that list ALL detected
hardware in a system.
Can I propose /proc/config/ioports and /proc/config/interrupts
for the full lists, with the existing ones remaining as active
lists?
Best wishes from Riley.
