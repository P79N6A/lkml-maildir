While the idea itself is nice, it would allow many attackers on your
host to "dive" under IDS systems or avoid stateful firewalls which do
protocol verification. And IDS system is "a three letter acronym
listening on your traffic". And you want to avoid that. =:-)
It won't traverse many firewalls either (because they won't let IPSEC
pass) and you might get in trouble with NAT and protocols that need
NAT fixup.
And you basically divide the Internet into "Linux <-> Linux" and "the
rest". :-)
