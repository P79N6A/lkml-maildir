Hi. I see "/proc/sys/kernel/sched_granularity_ns" mentioned on web sites 
and such, but I do have this file and cannot create it. Yes, I am root 
and /proc is mounted. Are there boot parameters that I must enable to 
tune this variable? Do I need to specifically enable this in .config?
I am using 2.6.23-rc2.
Thanks,
Dan
