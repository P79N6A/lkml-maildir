I was thinking about irq numbers and trying to avoid as early as possible 
their problem: namely that each and every platform has its own idea of 
which irq numbers are valid and which are not, some use 0 as invalid irq, 
some -1, some 256, etc. And when those platforms share drivers, problems 
arise. And the simple and efficient NO_IRQ notion, that would fis those 
problems nicely, cannot seem to establish itself.
The disadvantages I see in your suggestions are:
1. two accessors (is_valid_gpio() and NO_GPIO) instead of one
2. have to include errno.h
3. it doesn't seem very logical to me to define a gpio number in terms of 
   an error code
4. "confusing freedom" - NO_GPIO is the invalid gpio number, but, in fact, 
   you can use just any negative number
Advantages of my proposal:
1. simplicity - only one macro, and "well-definedness" - use this and only 
   this as invalid gpio number. The rest are either valid, or undefined.
2. overridable by platforms - though I don't have any examples at hand, I 
   can imagine, that some platforms would prefer some specific "natural" 
   for them numbers.
But, this is not something I would spend too much energy arguing about, 
and this is your code in the end:-) So, if you still disagree, I'll do it 
the way you suggest. I might well be wrong too:-)
Thanks
