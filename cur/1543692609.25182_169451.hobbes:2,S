Well, abs() is the only one I tripped over in my config.  I'm sure there's others
lurking elsewhere in the kernel tree.
The bigger question is whether a patch to support -ffreestanding would be a
good idea - with proper use of the __builtin_* stuff it *should* work, and it will
hopefully cause better kernel code hygiene..
