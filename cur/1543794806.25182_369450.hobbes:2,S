Based on the 2.6.15-rc1-mm2, there is a macro FLAGS_RESERVED defined in
include/linux/mmzone.h which says how many bits are served for teh
node+zone bits in the page flags with the remainder for normal page flags.
It's currently 9, leaving 21 bits for page flags of which 19 are used. I
don't think using another bit will cause breakage but I imagine it will
make eyebrows furrow.
