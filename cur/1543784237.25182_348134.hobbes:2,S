Actually, I do not really care about the Kconfig stuff. I just added
that to show you guys why and when the change in
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c was needed. So my main interest is to include
the fix to the single-node version of setup_memory(). This to sync up
the single-node case with the multiple-node version of setup_memory(),
and to make it easier for me and other people to start using sparsemem
om single-node (or non-NUMA if you prefer that) configurations.
