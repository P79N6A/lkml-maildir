I already run a bunch of tests on a variety of machines for every new 
kernel ... but don't have an automated way to compare the results as yet, 
so don't actually look at them much ;-(. Sometime soon (quite possibly over 
Christmas) things will calm down enough I'll get a couple of days to write 
the appropriate perl script, and start publishing stuff.

Yeah, probably. Though the stress tests catch a lot more than the 
functionality ones. The big pain in the ass is drivers, because I don't
have a hope in hell of testing more than 1% of them.
