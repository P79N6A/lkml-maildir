Well, *if* the reason of your issue was the same as the reason of
my issue (what could be, but must not be), you were in the lucky
position that after unclipping your drive your partition's size
was a multiple of 1024 *and* (2048|4096) while before it wasn't.
Chances of that are about 1:(1|3) - not that bad at all :)
