Subject: NS83820 2.6.0-test5 driver seems unstable on IA64

Hi,
	I'm having some problems with the NS83820 driver on Itanium-1.
1.  I see many many `unaligned accesses' when the IP header is
accessed (ip_input.c:410 and 423)
It looks as if the IP header is two byte aligned, when it ought to be
4-byte aligned.
The error message is, e.g., 
 kernel unaligned access to 0xe000000128d8881e, ip=0xe0000000047ba2d1
0xe0000000047ba2d1 is             
ip_input:410
		   if (iph->ihl < 5 || iph->version != 4)
		                goto inhdr_error; 
0xe000000128d8881e is what's calculated as &iph->ihl
The obvious approach of realigning the SKB by 2 bytes seems not to
work.
Any ideas?
