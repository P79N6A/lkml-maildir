Hello Randy,
Sorry for the language errors, English is not my Native language, so I
make these stupid errors...

OK, I will adapt that.

I know it is big on a 4k stack, and I also think it is not very nice...
But kmalloc() panics the kernel if I do it as soon as in the __setup() code.
The problem is that the original string may not be modified by the
cmdline-parser, and I do not know the length of the command up front,
(except that it cannot be longer than this define). Allocating a
global buffer is not safe and needs locking. So actually only what
left for me was the stack... or rewrite the used C-library-routines
completely myself, for this purpose only, which is also not nice.
I hope someone could point to me to another possibilty, that I did not
think of yet.
Kind Regards,
Remy
