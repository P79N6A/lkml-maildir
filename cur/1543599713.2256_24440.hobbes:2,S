Well, loook, if the signedness and widths match all the tests get optimized 
out as constant expressions, if they don't it barfs with BUG and the author 
has to insert specify saner types for the input variables.  It's nice.
This accomplishes what 3arg_min/max set out to do without messing up the 
syntax.
