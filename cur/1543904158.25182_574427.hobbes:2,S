You mean like the CFS group scheduler patches?  I don't see how this patch is 
related to that, besides working on top of it.

I agree.  My suggestion is that we try being fair from the bottom-up, rather 
than top-down.  If most of the rebalancing is local, we can minimize expensive 
locking and cross-node migrations, and scale very nicely on large NUMA boxes.

Divining the intentions of the administrator is an AI-complete problem and we're 
not going to try to solve that in the kernel.  An intelligent administrator 
could also allocate 50% of each CPU to a resource group containing all the 
*other* processes.  Then, when the other processes are scheduled out, your 
single task will run on whichever CPU is idle.  This will very quickly 
equilibrate to the scheduling ping-pong you seem to want.  The scheduler 
deliberately avoids this kind of migration by default because it hurts cache and 
TLB performance, so if you want to override this very sane default behavior, 
you're going to have to explicitly configure it yourself.

If you're not explicitly allocating resources, you're just low-latency, not 
truly realtime.  Realtime requires guaranteed resources, so messing with 
affinities is a necessary evil.

Which scheduler?  Have you tried the CFS group scheduler patches?
