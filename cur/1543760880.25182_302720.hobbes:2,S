As long as the patches to remove/quiten various texts go through the
various subsystem maintainers, this shouldn't be a problem, though
I imagine there will be some resistance to some parts.
One of the biggest offenders is ACPI. On my desktop, that alone
accounts for 10% of the messages since boot.
(12:05:09:davej@delerium:~)$ dmesg -s 128000 | grep ^ACPI | wc -l
50
(12:05:18:davej@delerium:~)$ dmesg -s 128000 | wc -l
500
On SMP there's way too much noise.
We could do some checks in the CPU init code to not print any
of the init junk if its the same as the boot CPU.
That should be fairly trivial, and would reduce quite a few messages.
Of the 500 messages in my dmesg scrollback right now, 412 of them
are unique. Removing some of this duplication sounds like an
excellent place to begin.
Another way to save some text could be to cluster multiple lines
so that instead of..
ACPI: IRQ0 used by override.
ACPI: IRQ2 used by override.
ACPI: IRQ9 used by override.
we have
ACPI: IRQs 0,2,9 used by override.
(Whatever the hell that message means anyway -- this one just used
 as an example).
