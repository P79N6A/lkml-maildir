I've thought a little bit more about it.
Why do you think, there is no way of waking up?
Is it, because, when I set it to 1000000000 and the back to,
let's say, 500, the pdflush threads don't wake up to recognize
this change? Is this the cause?
What about signaling all pdflush threads with, for example,
for(ALL_PDFLUSHS)
	kill(pid, SIGSTOP);
Don't they wake up then and recognize the reducing of the timeout?
The old noflushd did so to wake up updated.
thanks.
