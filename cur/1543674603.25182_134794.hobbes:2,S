Well, this got rid of the warning :) But actually when I stop irattach
(using Debian's init-script (/etc/init.d/irda stop)) my computer
freezes. This works (of course) fine with 2.4.21-rc2. I thought the
problem was the module unloading, but it seems to be something with
irattach instead. Sorry about that.

It works, but I get lots of weird/ugly/different messages. This is with
a SonyEricsson P800. Except for those annoying messages in my logs, it
works perfect :-)

I see I have gotten a ircomm_tty can't be unloaded as well. Hmm. Well,
as I said, it works perfect, except for stopping irattach.
Thanks.
