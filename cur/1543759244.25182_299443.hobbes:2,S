This flags are little in the short supply, but being able to tell
kernel code from memory hole seems like "must have", so yes, that
looks ok.
You could get subtle and reuse some other pageflag. I do not think
PG_reserved can have PG_locked... So using for example PG_locked for
this purpose should be okay.
