Eeeeeew.
So if I grabbed the first two slots before glibc got to
mess with them, glibc wouldn't break horribly?
If I grabbed one slot and glibc grabbed another, Wine
would be OK with the third instead of the second?
So basically it's not allowed to just grab the 3rd slot?
What if I want to find out what is already in use?
Am I supposed to iterate over all 8191 possible
GDT entries? How do I even tell how many slots
are available without using them all up?
Eeeeeeew. Well this was documented exactly nowhere.
The man page is even vague about entry_number,
meaning I had to dig in the kernel source (AMD manual
by my side) to find if that was a GDT slot or TLS slot,
as array index or byte offset, with or without the low bits
all set up for loading into the segment register, loaded for
me or not, etc.
