That the patch is agains a stable kernel does not mean it is stable
itself. many developers work against stable kernels, because their
working system is their test sytem at the same time.
Also, the brokenness of the particular cipher you mention is well
documented in the Encryption-HOWTO and the man page of the patched
losetup.
But please, try to make the CAST algorithm work for the CryptoAPI. I
don't think Alex Kjeldaas is actively working on that patch :-(
