The SYN flood message said:

The NFS server is 131.225.55.98. So it's very very unlikely that the NFS
server generated the SYN flood because:
o	the NFS server shouldn't use raw sockets to fill the IP header
	from userspace so as worse the source of the SYN flood should be
	131.225.55.98 and not 131.225.55.9
o	the nfs server usually shouldn't use TCP so it's not going to
	generate TCP-SYN packets anyway
NOTE: the 131.225.55.9 is not reliable. The attack could came from
everywhere in the world. You can trace it only by tracing the routing by
hand.

Ok I understand.
IMHO the source of these problems is outside the kernel.
