I forgot to mention this -- but I just get (on -rc6):
inotify_add_watch returned wd1 0
inotify_add_watch returned wd2 1
inotify_add_watch returned wd1 0
inotify_add_watch returned wd2 1
inotify_add_watch returned wd1 0
inotify_add_watch returned wd2 1
etc.
IOW, they are directly reused, not even with the +1 offset you were
