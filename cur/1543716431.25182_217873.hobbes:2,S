Thats not completely true. Last weekend I was using a 512Mb SD card on my iPAQ 
5550 with the 2.4.19 hh36.9 kernel from Handhelds.org. It was rather slow 
access (playing mp3s directly off the sd card had problems with pauses), but 
did work. I haven't actually got around to building a kernel for an ARM 
machine yet, but if you need the source I suggest you look round 
handhelds.org.

Edward
