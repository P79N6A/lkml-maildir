OK! I actually expected 2.4 to be somewhat selftuning. But if I exceed the
amount of physical RAM because I use a lot of sockets, I can understand that
Linux refuse.

Interesting you say that, I looked at the logs and I see over 5000 sockets
used, does'nt look peaceful to me. But you are absolutely right about the
orphans. The error about "too many orphans" must be wrong and is triggered
by some other condition. Look at the output from the debug printk I've
added:
Feb 18 15:43:50 mcquack kernel: TCP: too many of orphaned sockets
Feb 18 15:43:50 mcquack kernel: TCP: debug sk->wmem_queued 5364
tcp_orphan_count 124 tcp_memory_allocated 6146
Not many orphans but still an error, OK!

Removed, makes not visible difference. OK!

I raised the numbers a little bit more. Now with 128MB RAM in the box we can
handle a maximum of 7000 connections. No more because we start to swap too
much.
Feb 21 10:43:41 mcquack kernel: KERNEL: assertion (tp->lost_out == 0) failed
at tcp_input.c(1202):tcp_remove_reno_sacks
One about every 10 minutes.
I want to add a few conclusions and observasions to all this. Previously the
owner of this machine handled about 10k connections with FreeBSD, same
amount of RAM, same app and no tuning.
To run with very many sockets open I have to
1) Tune Linux heavily
and
2) The error about "too many orphans" is bogus?
3) I will get a lot of debug crap i syslog
4) FreeBSD with the same hardware and software handles more connections
Found this article, "The Linux 20k" socket challenge. Pretty interesting!

This happened once under very heavy load (8000+ connections) and I have been
unable to reproduce.
We have decided to upgrade the system and try to handle 20-30k connections,
will let you know how it goes!
