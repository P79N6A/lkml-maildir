kernel 2.4.2-ac24.
first, i have 256MB of RAM and a 128MB swap. i know the recommendation
is RAM*2 for swap, but is that a *requirement* as well? i understand the
active/inactive page debate and why *2 is needed (lets not argue that),
but am i just wasting space with a 128MB swap?
second, is there any performance issues with a swap partition vs a swap
file. without resizing, i am stuck with the 128mb partition.
thanks,
