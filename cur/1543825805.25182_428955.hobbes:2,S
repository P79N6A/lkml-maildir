I'll take a look at the references. I agree with you that it will be useful
to have resource management for a group of tasks.

Yes, any information or pointers to them will be very useful.

ckrm has a solution to provide cpu guarantees. 
I think as far as CPU resource management is concerned (limits or guarantees),
there are common problems to be solved, for example
1. Tracking when a limit or a gaurantee is not met
2. Taking a decision to cap the group
3. Selecting the next task to execute (keeping O(1) in mind)
For the existing resource controller in OpenVZ I would be
interested in the information on the kinds of patterns it does not
perform well on and the patterns it performs well on.

Traffic shaping is just for outgoing traffic right? How about incoming
traffic (through the accept call)

These are a great set of requirements. Thanks for putting them together.
