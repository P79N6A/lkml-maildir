I want both TB and core speeds, but TB is more important.
Originally, I used and sampled the x86 time-stamp counter to
provide an additional clock-like register for measurements.
On x86, observable TSC freq == core freq, so the CPU speed
I report to users coincides with TSC speed. This is then
used to derive high-resolution actual time from TSC counts.
When adding PPC32 support, I used TB for the clock-like
entity, but had to introduce a TB-to-core multiplier to
maintain the notion that clock*multiplier == core speed.
If TB speed is constant but core speed is not, then this
was a mistake and I should instead report TB speed only,
and let user-space convert TB counts to time directly
without conversion via core speed.
So can I assume constant TB speed? In that case I don't
really care about core speed changes.
