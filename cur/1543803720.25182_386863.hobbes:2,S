Hi Eric.
I forgot to point out one ugly solution for this.
You can include a dummy Kbuild (Makefile) in each directory to support
this. I recall that reiser4 had similar question and this was the
solution I pointed out for them too.
No - I am not in favour of it. But for local development it could make
sense.
So it may solve the "Eric" part of it, but not the "Andrew" part of it
since these file will never get in the mainstream kernel (hopefully).
