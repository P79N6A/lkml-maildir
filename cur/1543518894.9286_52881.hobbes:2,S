Linux Folks,
The Netware file system supports Macintosh files and information via
both appletalk and TCPIP on Native Netware via the Macintosh Namespace. 
We allow Linux to create and support this namespace.  I have looked at
the VFS for all versions of Linux, and I do not see any hooks for
dealing with the MAC FinderInfo (32 bytes), or for a MAC resource fork.
If a Macintosh connects to a linux box, does it just use NFS/FTP style
access, or does Linux support multiple data streams for MAC clients. 
Windows NT/2000 has support in their VFS for MAC clients, so when I am
mounting Netware filesystems (or converting them to NTFS) I can also
provide any Macintosh file data to Windows NT/2000 that may exist on
these volumes.  I can see where customers may not like losing their MAC
data if they convert from Netware to Linux when they mount their
previous Netware volumes under Linux.
Is there any Macintosh File support in Linux via the VFS or IOCTL's
through the NFS?  I looked through the other FS's and don't even see
IOCTL's for dealing with this, though I admit I may not recognize what I
am looking at.  I am also curious is we have a MAC server for presenting
MAC files to MAC clients with all the widgets they come to expect.
(I'm almost through the entire list for NWFS 2.0 -- looks like this is
the last thing to do prior to Open Source release, less LRU tuning and
async elevator support which are being worked on at present).
Please Advise,
Jeff
