Retraction time - Manfred's right, we don't generally assume write
ordering on SMP. Writes remain ordered on single processors (ie reads
never speculate ahead of writes) but that's fairly obviously the only sane
way to go. x86 is strongly ordered but other systems and things like PCI
bus are not necessarily.
It's best not to think about subtle things like causality models at 2am.
