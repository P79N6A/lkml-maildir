Greetings,
I have a question about the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  linuc/cdrom.h
defines several possible return values for this ioctl:
> #define CDS_NO_INFO             0       /* if not implemented */
> #define CDS_NO_DISC             1
> #define CDS_TRAY_OPEN           2
> #define CDS_DRIVE_NOT_READY     3
> #define CDS_DISC_OK             4
Whenever I expect CDS_NO_DISC or CDS_TRAY_OPEN from the syscall, I
actually receive CDS_NO_INFO.  I assume that this means CDS_NO_DISC and
CDS_TRAY_OPEN are not implemented for my drive, as the comment seems to
state.  A side effect of this is that a _LOT_ of error messages pop up
in my syslogs if I am trying to do any kind of polling as I wait for the
drive's status to change.
My question is, why are these portions not implemented?  Is it a hardware
limitation?  Will they be implemented in the future?
Some relavent info:
kernel:		2.2.7
CD-ROM:		YAMAHA CRW4416S
SCSI Card:	Adaptec AHA-294OUW
Thanks!
