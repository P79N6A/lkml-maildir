Hi Helge,
Thank you for the quick response.  While I was un-modularizing everything per 
your message, I spotted the problem: I didn't have the IDE drivers getting 
built (probably because they are named "ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL" in the config 
menu).  All is relatively working now (I can't seem to open a console in X 
windows if I have devfs built - I think this has something to do with 
securetty, but I've made the devfs changes to that file and it is still not 
working).
Thanks for your help!
-Joe
