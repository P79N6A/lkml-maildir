That would be a fair assumption. But it is required to be a NOP on
platforms that don't need the "hint" ("attr" or whatever you want
to call it). Specific architectures (SN2 in this case) will need
to implement something.

Correct. The same driver needs to compile on all architectures.

I agree. Just have to sort those issues out as people come up with them.

The latter. I have no intention of adding arch specific flags that
only mean something on one arch. The intent here is to enable
correct functionality on specific arches without impacting
performance on arches that don't need those "attributes".
