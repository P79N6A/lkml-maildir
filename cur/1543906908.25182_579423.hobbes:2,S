Hi,
after upgrading from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22 the CPU temperatures shown by
w83781d look unreal.  They were in a range from 40°C when idle to
75°C under full load with 2.6.21.  The values shown now are in a very
small range from 77°C to 82°C.  From the (low) noise of the fan I can
tell that the temperature is <50°C.
The third temperature shown is completely wrong.
I have a Tyan Tiger MPX board with a w83782d chip. Output from
"sensors":
w83782d-i2c-0-2d
Adapter: SMBus AMD768 adapter at 80e0
 +5 V:     +4.81 V  (min =  +4.76 V, max =  +5.24 V)

CPU2 Temp: +77.5°C  (high =   +80°C, hyst =   +75°C)   sensor = transistor   ALARM

77500
Any ideas?
