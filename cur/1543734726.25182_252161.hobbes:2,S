I hope so for 2.6.9. Not too sure of the plans, but if they prove
stable early on in -mm, I think there may be enough time to get them

I know we've been trying to move stuff *out* of there, but this is

going to be used by more than a few files outside sched.c, so maybe
it could go to its own file if anyone felt strongly about it.
