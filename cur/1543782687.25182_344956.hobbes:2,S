Below is the console from the session it is interesting that gdb is not
able to access the memory.   I let it continue and then ctrl-c broke it
later in the boot cycle and tried disass again with the same result.
Feel free to flog me if this is stupid but I have just one EM64T machine
(test) and I'm using a regular P4 machine as dev.  I build the test
kernel on the EM64T machine and then copy the updated sources, object
files, and images via NFS to the dev machine.  I believe I read in the
kgdb doc that it was possible to use to different architecture machines
for test and dev although there wasn't any information about how to do
it.  This is probably the source of the OS/ABI warning.  I can probably
get the mothership to send me another EM64T machine if need be.
