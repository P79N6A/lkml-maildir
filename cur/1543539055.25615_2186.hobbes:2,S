You could make exactly the same argument for including support for 
writing kernel internals in any other language.
I think the issue here is that if the kernel developers allow people to
write kernel code in C++, it will require other kernel developers to
know C++; keeping Linux to one language makes it easier for people to 
modify each other's code.
