Right.  I believe I performed a similar audit not to long ago
when everything was converted to C99 initializers and everything
was fine then.

Where did this entry above in devinet_sysctl come from?

I probably would have just done:

What added the additional entry to devinet_root_dir?  I don't see that
in Linus' tree?
The result may be fine but if it isn't named in a per network device
manner we are adding duplicate entries to the root /proc/sys directory
which is wrong.
Actually come to think of it I am concerned that someone added a
settable entry into /proc/sys/ it should at least be in /proc/sys/net/
where it won't conflict with other uses of that directory.  Especially
as things like network devices have user controlled names.
