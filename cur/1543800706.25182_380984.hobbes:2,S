Bingo. Yes I know why this is occuring now. 
There is a known old bug with error handling in some cases on promise
chips. The core kernel code tries to clean up any remaining data after
an error (to handle chip prefetch/postwrite FIFOs) if DRQ_STAT is
asserted. Its a nice trick, saves on resets and slow recovery but isn't
compatible with some promise controllers.
The -mm tree has a partial but incomplete fix to this implemented, the
base kernel does not have this fixed.
Its been known for some time so perhaps the ide maintainers have patches
waiting for 2.6.16 now its opened ?
