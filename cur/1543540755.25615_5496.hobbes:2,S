There are different h/w arrangement for RS485 IIRC though, these cards give 
the folowing options:-
	Half-duplex auto-gated,
	Half-duplex RTS switch, tx when RTS high[1]
	Half-duplex RTS switch, tx when RTS low[1]
	Both Tx/Rx Disabled.
 	Tx only
	Rx Only
	Full Duplex.
I guess you were using either option 2 or 3 with that.
These various modes are handled by the hardware and you can switch
them just be setting the register approriately. Assuming kernel
or CAP_SYS_RAWIO (is this the right one?).
TTFN
[1] Just to confuse matters one set of these cards then goes and uses DTR 
    instead of RTS.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
