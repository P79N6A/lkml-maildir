Yes, one cannot rely on that across architectures either. But, in
practice, binfmt_elf.c is used by all architectures that support ELF,
so it is likely that the env-follows-arg is consistent across ELF
programs at least. And that is a Good Thing(tm), since otherwise
proc_pid_cmdline() would need to consider every possible layout.
On the other side, binfmt_aout.c for example might do something
completely different. Luckily it does the same compact placing as
binfmt_elf.c, so proc_pid_cmdline() should also work with AOUT
programs.

On Linux, yes. Since the setproctitle(3) call has originated from BSD,
things might be a little different there.

Well, the environment string is the only place where extra data can go
at the moment. If you place you arguments somewhere else, then they are
not part of the argument string, and would not show up in `ps`.

setproctitle(), as provided by sendmail, copies the environment to the
heap before attempting to overwrite the argument and (possibly) the
environment string. Other implementations might not be so careful,
though.

Nothing should break if you make the PAGE_SIZE restriction go away,
since it is only procfs that limits the output to PAGE_SIZE. A program
can still access its full argv -- configure scripts sometimes check for
the maximum length of the argument string, and show that it can be up
to 128KB, a lot more than just one page.
