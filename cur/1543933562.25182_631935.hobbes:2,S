Subject: [PATCH] aoe: initialize locking structures before registering char devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch was made against 2.6.24-rc6-mm1.
In March 2007, Alexey Dobriyan suggested this change, which
eliminates a race after register_chardev has been called but
the locking primitives protecting the error messages ring
buffer have not yet been initialized.
The initialization could happen at compile time, but that
would leave aoe as the only user of __DECLARE_SEMAPHORE_GENERIC.
