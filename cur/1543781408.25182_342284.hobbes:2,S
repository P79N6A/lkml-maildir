I've tried several times now to reproduce the oops, but there might have been 
another factor that led to the oops, because just booting the kernel and 
shutting down does not trigger it. I have tried reproducing all conditions up 
to the time that the oops actually occurred and think it might just be my 
hardware going flaky - so I have reloaded the module that taints the kernel 
(have done this already and having the module loaded when the powerdown 
started did not trigger the oops) and am seeing if using it for any period of 
time causes the oops to occur. If it does I will try the other driver 
available for the modem, although that one also contains proprietary code. 
The upside is that it does not make use of any functions marked as deprecated 
in any version of the kernel, where the official driver requires me to 
re-enable a deprecated function that had been made non-exported by the 
kernel.
