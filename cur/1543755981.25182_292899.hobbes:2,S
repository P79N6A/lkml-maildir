I'm not a fan for this either. The good news is most graphics cards don't 
require these tricks. The only ones that do are the ix86 cards. The real 
solution would be if the hradware vendors open the parts of the spec to do 
what we need. Many of the older cards could be supported in this way if we
talk to the vendors. They shouldn't care if the specs are released anymore. 
The problem would be the latest Radeon card and NVIDIA cards which 
unfortunely are the most common cards for x86 platforms ;-(
