Actually, updatedb sucks even worse.  The database is notoriously
outdated and each run of updatedb has the effect of flushing the
cache.  Because of the cache-flushing effect, you cannot even run it
with maximum niceness.  Running it still hurts you *afterwards*.
Same goes for you userland daemon without kernel support.
