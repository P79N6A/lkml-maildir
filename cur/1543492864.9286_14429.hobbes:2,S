Just thought I should report: I've been running esd since yesterday, with
no packet loss.  So whatever the problem is that I was seeing earlier
may have been fixed somewhere along the line by somebody.  [I don't
think I've upgraded my kernel, but I think I did pick up a new version
of esd somewhere along the line, and hadn't gotten around to testing it.
Then again, I've not been keeping careful track of this issue.]
