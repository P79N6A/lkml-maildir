| just curious - how did you find this - code review or some tool help like

Unfortunately -- by reading the code :( I would prefer
if gcc or sparse complain about it but we have indirect
referring which is that hard to trace by any tool I believe
(until say some emulator but even if we have such kind of
tool we would need to tell it that 'there we have boundries
we shouldn't cross)'. But to be fair -- I didn't try sparse
here maybe it does complain :)
