No, it's not needed.
I was mislead by the fact that all fixups there are marked with __devinit.

Yep, the same is probably true for:
static void __devinit pci_fixup_i450nx(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit pci_fixup_i450gx(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit  pci_fixup_umc_ide(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit  pci_fixup_latency(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit pci_fixup_piix4_acpi(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit pci_fixup_via_northbridge_bug(struct pci_dev *d)
static void __devinit pci_fixup_transparent_bridge(struct pci_dev *dev)
