They need to run very early on in some ways. We don't want to assign a
PnP device over something we didnt know exists. We can scan the other
busses first safely but we can't activate devices or do anything else
until the ISA unsafe probes run. Those also have some very careful
ordering especially in networking. NE2000 must run early, other probes
can make some cards move around so must also be ordered
