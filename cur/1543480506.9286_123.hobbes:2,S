Hi,
I ran into the strange behaviour that linux did not recognize
my printer port. A bit of kernel debugging showed me that it
was the outb_p/inb_p test with LP_DUMMY that failed.
I fixed it by faking that the test succeed (see code diff below).
Computer: Compaq Presario 5670
Processor: Intel Pentium II, 450 MHz
RAM: 128 MB
Distribution: SuSE Linux 5.3
Kernel: linux-2.0.35.SuSE
I thought that you would like to know about the problem
on the Compaq Presario 5670. I would also appriciate it
if you have a better idea for the workaround.
Thanx,
/Tom
