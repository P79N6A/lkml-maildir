Dumb memcpy (while (len--) { *d++ = *s++ }) will have alignment problems
in any case. Intelligent ones, like the one provided in glibc, first copy
bytes till output is aligned (C file) *or* size is a multiple (i686 asm file)
of word size, and then it copies word-by-word.
Linux's x86_64 memcpy does the opposite, copies 64bit words, and then
copies the last bytes.
So, in effect, as long as no packed structures are used, memcpy should
be safer on *int, etc., than *char, as the compiler ensures
word-alignment.
