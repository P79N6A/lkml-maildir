I'm not sure if we want these "historical" files. We don't have them for
the other input types, and I believe that it's not the driver's job to
compute and export these values. If anyone cares about the history of
sensed values, that's something for a user-space application to
implement. This will also be much more flexible in user-space, as it
becomes possible to decide the exact time range to consider, to
remember at which time the peak occurred, etc.
