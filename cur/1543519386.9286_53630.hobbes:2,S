Just to confirm that the above is the *right* fix (despite some doubts I
had for a minute), the e820 map as discovered during boot on this hardware
looks like this (using gdb -q vmlinux /proc/kcore):
(gdb) p e820
$3 = {nr_map = 0x8, map = {{addr = 0x0, size = 0x9f800, type = 0x1}, {addr
= 0x9f800, 
      size = 0x800, type = 0x2}, {addr = 0xf0000, size = 0x10000, type =
0x2}, {addr = 0x100000, 
      size = 0x3f00000, type = 0x1}, {addr = 0xfec00000, size = 0x10000,
type = 0x2}, {
      addr = 0xfee00000, size = 0x10000, type = 0x2}, {addr = 0xfff80000,
size = 0x80000, 
      type = 0x2}, {addr = 0x100000000, size = 0x0, type = 0x1}, {addr =
0x0, size = 0x0, 
      type = 0x0} <repeats 24 times>}}
so, the entry e820[7] is definitely bogus (addr = 0x100000000) and is best
avoided and not counted as valid E820_RAM...

Tigran.
