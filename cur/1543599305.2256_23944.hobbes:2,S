In my dangerous mode of "if it's presented to me, compile it", I've noticed
alot of junk being presented as a buildable option under the wrong arch.
For example, the Sparc64 and ARM MTD Map drivers are selectable from an
x86 build.  Some might say this is a shell bug, but at any rate, dep_*
don't function correctly (read: as one would expect) in the cases where
the deps are not defined.
For:
  dep_tristate '  Sun Microsystems userflash support' CONFIG_MTD_SUN_UFLASH $CONFIG_SPARC64
$CONFIG_SPARC64 is null and this doesn't appear to the shell function as an
arg.  Thus, it's presented as a selectable (tho' not compilable) option.
The same is visable for CONFIG_MTD_SA1100 and CONFIG_MTD_DC21285 (ARM).
Options:
 1) Don't select things that aren't in your machine/arch.
    (Translation: "Live with it.")
 2) Quote all the options.
    (ewww.)
 3) Fix the function(s).
