All in what you are used to reading. I grew up with ranges sepcified as 
something like
   0 <= x <= 40
in the spec, and therefore still write it like
   if (0 <= x && x <= 40)
because that makes it obvious (to me) that it's a range check.
A case of the language not having a range check operator and various 
people finding one thing or another readable.
