Wish i knew, I'm praying that 2.2.19 hasn't/doesn't implement the ide patches like 2.4.x did.  If so, and a major problem is found in
2.2.18, then I have to maintain another machine running 2.2.18 to restore tapes.  Also means i'd have to stop using taper or dump,
and stick to tar only, as both want to read the tape back in at some point.
