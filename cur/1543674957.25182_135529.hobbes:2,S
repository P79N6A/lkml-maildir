Hello !
My bad. This is one of the kernels that had modified the IO subsystem to 
replace the io_request_lock with a finer grained host_lock and queue_lock.
I also noticed that the hang occurs when the settings of bdflush are the 
following:
root@dyn-10-123-130-235 vm]# cat bdflush
30      50      32      100     50      300     60      0       0
Thanks
