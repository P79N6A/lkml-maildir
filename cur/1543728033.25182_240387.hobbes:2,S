Sounds good; how about something less terrifying? That warning sounds like a 
ruined cd is likely.

This breaks the real time policy entirely. That's why I run it SCHED_ISO ... 
but of course this isn't available in mainline linux.

It was a hard lockup and randomly happened during a cd write, creating my 
first coaster in a long time... in rt mode ironically which is how it is 
recommended to be run. So I removed the foolish superuser bit and have had 
no problem since. Yes it was unaltered cdrecord source and it was the 
so-called alpha branch and... Not much else I can say about it really?
