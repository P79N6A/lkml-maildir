Wrong! The NFS cache consistency model (close-to-open cache consistency)
requires you to be able to revalidate the cache on open() whether or not
you are using posix locking. In fact, most alternatives to posix locking
(for instance dotlocking, which is frequently used by email
applications) rely heavily on this.
See for instance
