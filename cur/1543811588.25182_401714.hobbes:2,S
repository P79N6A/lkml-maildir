Yeah, cleaver.
That is not really a constructive responce. I dont use , I do use command  
line mount all the time. I never was in danger of damaging my drive with  
this new "feature".
Telling a user who has just burnt out a brand new 1GB usb device he should  
have RTFM and modified that HAL configuration to insure it did not use  
sync it not likely to win much confidence in the linux kernel.
The point of raising this is that the vast majority of linux users have no  
awareness of this. If there is a danger of this sync implementation  
damaging hardware it should be done differently.
More importantly this sync strategy is very likely _increasing_ the danger  
of data loss that is the core reason for using sync in the first place.
To quote from my earlier post:
The new model attempts to be more rigourous by updating the FAT every time
a block of data is written. Thus the "hammering" of the physical memory
hosting the FAT record.
In view of the nature of flash memory this may actually be drastically
increasing the chance that the whole FAT gets erased.
If a pullout occurs during write , there is now a near 50% chance that
this takes out the entire FAT.
Now if that analysis is inaccurate I'd like be corrected. But flash has to  
be zeroed to be written. If every second write is zeroing the FAT this  
would seem much more likely to destroy the whole fs than to provide better  
protection from a untimely pull-out.
