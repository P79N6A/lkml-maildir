Actually, it's probably closer to:
   make cpu
      |
   smp tests run ok? -------> No, sell as XP
      |
   yes, do we have more demand
   for XPs than we have supply
   of those that didn't pass? -------> Yes, sell as XP
      |
   No, sell as MP
Remember, AMD is just trying to make a buck.  If they've got a bunch of
MP CPUs "sitting on the shelves" while no one can get their hands on the
XPs, some of those MPs are going to "become" XPs.  For those of us on a
budget, we can only hope to get one of *those* variety of XPs.
Now, that said, I'm probably going to buy MPs when I build my machine,
as long as the price difference stays as the current low levels.
Consider it a "warranty" or something.
Just my $0.02
