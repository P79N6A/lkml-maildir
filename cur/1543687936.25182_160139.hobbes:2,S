Paul, I've not been able to reproduce those swapoff failures.
Your ltp.outs indicate that it was the swapon which failed,
but its error code is not shown; nor the tmpfile outputs from
setup's system(3) calls (if I remember rightly, system succeeds
if it can run what's asked, whether what it runs fails or not).
Please try running a swapoff01 and swapoff02 modified to catch
that info: it may quickly identify the issue.
Hugh
