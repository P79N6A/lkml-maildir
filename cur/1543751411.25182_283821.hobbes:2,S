Interesting - I was familiar with the original swappiness thread 
(
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3000
) but haven't seen anything since 
then (I mainly follow via kernel-traffic - enjoyable, but nowhere near 
real time). There's clearly been a bunch more discussion...
Not to rehash the performance arguments, but it appears from my read of 
the kernel trap page referenced above that the primary argument for swap 
is still the performance argument - I didn't see anything referencing 
swap being necessary to move DMAable ram or lowmem. Was that posted 
previously on linux-kernel but not on kerneltrap?
I'm still under the impression that "to swap or not" is a 
performance/policy/risk-management question, not a correctness question. 
If I'm wrong, I'd definitely like to know...
