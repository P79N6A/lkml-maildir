That's what I though too so I asked it first on the security mailing list.
Apparently this signal behavior is normal.

Stopping is a special case. But it is effectively the same as being
indefinately slowed down by, say, 10000+ malicious processes and from
that angle I don't see a fundamental difference w.r.t. security.
Killing the malicous processes should solve the problem. And killing
one FUSE process looks easier to me than killing 10000+ ones.

I think this is not true. Every pathname passed to a setuid program
by the user is basically "tainted". Standard I/O is tainted as well.

They shouldn't. The pathname is not to be trusted anyway.
I think FUSE has shown to be conservative enough w.r.t. security to be
merged. But it may be interesting to consider:
-	replace ptraceability test by a kill()ability test.
-	some sort of "intr" mount option for most signals on by default.
-	Forbid hiding data by mounting a FUSE filesystem on top of it (does
	FUSE check for this already?)
-	/proc isn't a problem: most root processes tend to avoid it because
	it is synthetic and thus uninteresting. Maybe we should extend
	the idea of "synthetic file-systems being uninteresting" to any
	process which cannot receive signals from the FUSE mount owner. When
	one cannot hide data by a FUSE mount and its synthetic anyway so not
	interesting then just show the original empty mount point.
