Actually, the latter I already did at one point (it worked well - I made
sure that the page mapping functions worked in kernel space too, even
though all 1:1-mapped kernel pages used 4M addressing). 
I removed this simply because there wasn't enough use for it, and it
complicated the code slightly (not much, but considering that nobody
used it it wasn't worth maintaining).
