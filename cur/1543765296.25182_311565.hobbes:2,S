We need a lock for the tree modification, yes.

The point of the provisional window is that you don't need read/write
locks at all.  The provisional window lets you unlock the tree
completely while you do the bitmap scan, so there's really no reason to
have rwlocks for the tree any more.

When we take the provisional window, we can make a note of how much
space we have before the next window.  And because all future allocators
will stall if they try to allocate at this point due to the provisional
window, we know that that space will remain outside any other window
until we come to fix the provisional window and potentially roll it
forward to the space we found.

As long as the space is within the area between the provisional window
and its successor, we don't need to do that.  (It gets more complex if
the bitmap search returns a bit _beyond_ the next window, though.)

Right, that was the intent --- sorry if I didn't make it clear.

Exactly.
Note that there _is_ some additional complexity here.  It's not entirely
free.  Specifically, if we have other tasks waiting on our provisional
window, then we need to be very careful about the life expectancy of the
wait queues involved, so that if the first task fixes its window and
then deletes it before the waiters have woken up, they don't get
confused by the provisional window vanishing while being waited for.
The easy solution is a global wait queue for that, but that doesn't
scale well.  The complex solution is a per-window wait queue and
reference count, which is obviously a bit of bloat, though probably
worth it for the high-load case.
Cheers,
 Stephen
