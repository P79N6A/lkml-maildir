Subject: [2.4.21-pre3] APIC routing broken on ASUS P2B-DS

Something broke between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21-pre3 which is causing
interrupts to not be routed the second CPU.  I saw the problem on one box
and copied the kernel to another which then had the same problem (both
ASUS P2B-DS boards, one with PIII CPUs, one with PII CPUs).  
[sroot@devel:/]# cat /proc/interrupts

With 2.4.20:
[sroot@devel:/root]# cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:      23627      27340    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:          0          2    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          2          1    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 16:       1671          2   IO-APIC-level  eth0
 19:        965        979   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
NMI:          0          0

...If nobody knows what happened immediately, I'll try narrowing it down
to the patch.
