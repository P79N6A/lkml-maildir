Perhaps in mainline as an option?  The [*] notations next to things are
really nice, they let you turn kernel stuff on and off :)  It's
appropriate for mainline to support added security isn't it?  I think
following the path of supporting-but-not-forcing is the best route,
because it encourages people to account for systems which may take
advantage of such options, and thus leads to a software base in which
it's quite sane to actually enable those options globally.
That's just how I think though.
