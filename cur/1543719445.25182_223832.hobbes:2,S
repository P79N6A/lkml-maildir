Hi,
i want to run linux 2.6.6 kernel, which needs upgrade of some system tools
such as module-init-tools and nfs-utils. but other guys using the same
machine with 2.4 kernel don't want me to upgrade them.
is there any way i can make different system tools installed when i boot
with the different kernel images other than mounting root directory to the
different partitions? (i can't create a new partition)
thank you,
