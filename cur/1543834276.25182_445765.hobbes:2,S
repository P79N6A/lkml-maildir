Can't be done, as it creates the possibility of loops. The "only files can
be hardlinked" idea makes garbage collection (== deleting of unreachable
objects) simple: Just check the number of references.
Detecting unconnected subgraphs uses a /lot/ of memory; and much worse, you
have to stop (almost) all filesystem activity while doing it.
Besides, the flow "root down through directories" gives a natural order in
which to go locking stuff when needed; if there can be loops, the system
could easily deadlock.
