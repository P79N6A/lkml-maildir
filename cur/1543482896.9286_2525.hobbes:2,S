Hello Linus,
  unfortunately, I must admit that this is not true. There are four
problems:
  At first, ioremap does not exist on sparc32, if I did not
critically miss something (I'm not sure whether sparc32 can have PCI,
but there should be one interface, for SBUS too). And I'm not sure, whether
ioremap works correctly on PReP. When writting matroxfb, I tried
ioremap(vga_base, 16MB), ioremap(vga_base+0xC0000000, 16MB) and
ioremap(vga_base+0x80000000, 16MB). Some of them died with
`invalid value written into msr2', some did not return from ioremap
(FYI, PowerStack I, 32MB RAM). I found only one working way:
`virt = vga_base + _ISA_MEM_BASE' - because of whole PCI MMIO space is
mapped at _ISA_MEM_BASE on PReP (sorry, do not ask me for patches for PPC,
I do not understand neither that architecture nor their assembly language).
  At second, on some (all?) big endian archs, readl/writel stores data
in little-endian format. I do not know, whether this idea is correct
and I'm sure that it is not documented.
  And at third, in structure pci_device, there is array with addresses
of PCI devices. It should contain CPU view of device address, i.e.
something suitable for ioremap(). It contains PCI bus view... So another
case.
  And fourth, minor problem, document does not state that `virtual' address
should be `unsigned long' and not `anything *'.
  Of course, I can say that on i386 and Alpha everything works fine when
done by IO-mapping document, but I was not able to get my driver work
on PPC without (a) PPC box on the table and (b) looking for long hours
into PPC code. But maybe that I'm just too stupid and I should not program
for live :-(
  So, Linus, if you read to this point, I wish you everything best, keep
up good work, sorry for your wasted time and I hope, that there are no more
showstoppers hidden in 2.2.0.
                                            Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
                                                vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
P.S.: Sorry to PPC peoples, but I did not port matroxfb into sparc, mips,
m68k or arm yet, so I cannot comment on these architectures.
