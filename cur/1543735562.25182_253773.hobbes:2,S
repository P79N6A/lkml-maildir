You've answered your own question Sergei. Thing is - you mentioned the
AGP aperature settings in your original post and then got tied up
thinking there's a bug in the kernel but we have to rule out stuff
like X getting very unhappy trying to play in the wrong place or
something. Try a simple test case and then see if you can give any
other handy details on your situation.
Jon.
