I find it interesting to compare this thread with a thread from about
a week ago talking about how /proc/cpuinfo wasn't consistent
across architectures - where we come round to the view of whether
the application writers shouldn't care/are too dumb/shouldn't need
to know about/can't be trusted  with knowing about what the real
hardware is.
Personally I think this is a good case of where the application
should take care of it - with whatever support the OS can really
give.
(That is if this is actually a real problem and not just
purely theoretical - my crypto knowledge isn't good enough
to answer that - but it feels very very abstract).
