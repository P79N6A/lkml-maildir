No, there is a fundamental problem with "solving" this via linking.   
Many programs need the continuous FD allocation space, but then have  
tendancies to do things like:
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++)
           if (i != comm_sock && i != server_sock)
                   close(i);
Yes I have seen many such programs, it seems to be a pretty standard  
idiom.
On the other hand, that makes it completely impossible for libraries  
to reliably use FDs behind the application's back; they might get  
closed on you at any time without warning.  One such library is  
glibc; it would really like to be able to use file-descriptors behind  
the back of the rest of userspace to implement certain functionality:

msg163522.html
Likewise there are a massive group of other libraries (especially  
user-interface and server related ones) that would really like to  
have support for creating file-descriptors without the top-level  
application closing them randomly (like several shells seem to).
