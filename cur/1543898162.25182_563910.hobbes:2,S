I'm not sure I follow.  If you require block allocation at mmap(2) time, 
rather than when a page is actually dirtied, you are denying userspace 
the ability to do sparse files with mmap.
A quick Google readily turns up people who have built upon the 
mmap-sparse-file assumption, and I don't think we want to break those 
assumptions as a "bug fix."
Where is the bug?
