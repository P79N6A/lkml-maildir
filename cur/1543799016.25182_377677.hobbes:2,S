Greetings;
I tried to rebuild rc6 without the size optimizations, but that 
resulted in some sort of a timer problem being logged at about 1 
second intervals to the vt's.
I'm back in rc5 now, cause rc6 is best described as a dog for desktop 
use, kmail freezes for 10 seconds at a time.  rc5 does do that nearly 
as bad.
Useing Con's scheduler as default in both cases.

stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
