Hi,
Kernels like 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test4 (cset-455) with compiled in
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC lacks the ehternet routing.
Take care.
P.S. It's on 2.4.22-ac1 and 2.4.22-ck1 too! But 2.4.22-rc2 has better APIC, so
good idea is to use it with -ac3 on that kernel.
PP.S. There is also radeonfb bug settings fonts and loadkeys only on
/dev/tty1.
