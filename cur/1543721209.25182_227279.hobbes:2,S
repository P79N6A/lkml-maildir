Ok - SGI has no issues with a 32768 CPU limit ... for now ;).

Then use others ??
The way I learned Unix, decades ago, the tradition was to use a variety
of errno values, even if they were a slightly strange fit, in order to
provide more detailed error feedback.  Look for example at the rename(2)
or acct(2) system calls.
So long as the man page shows them, it can be helpful.
