hi,
        I'm trying to add some code to netif_receive_skb function in
dev.c file . The cycles consumed by that code was around 16 cycles on
Dual Core Opetron machine.I'm working on that code for last 6 months
now and the consumed cycles have always been around 16 cycles .I don't
touch any other part of kernel .
But for last 4 days the consumed cycles have suddenly increased to
around 35 cycles . I'm using RDTSC instruction to profile the
code.There is no change in code and the kernel version is also the
same .I am assuming that there  must be something wrong with hardware.
Please guide me how can i figure out the root cause.What areas should
i look at to find out the reason for increased number of cycles.I
don't think that there is any issue in kernel because the kernel
version and code  is same    . Can the the log messages during system
bootup help me to diagnose the problem
