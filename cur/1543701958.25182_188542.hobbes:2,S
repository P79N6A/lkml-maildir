It depends -- generally either PIT (that's 2.4) or TSC, the latter switches
back to PIT once CPUFreq is used. I've never seen any problems with the
bogomips loop or /proc/cpuinfo, except when it could be directly attributed
to CPUFreq bugs.
I booted the following with clock=crazy:
1) 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 with Dmitry's patch: deadlock as before
2) 2.6.0-test11-almost vanilla (Nigel's swsusp patches): passed, results
   similar to -rc1-mm1 vanilla, i.e. cpuinfo shows 0 MHz and bogomips is
   miscalculated.
So it seems to be a more generic problem.
2.6.1-rc1 is on the way.
