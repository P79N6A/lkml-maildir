[ reposted under this subject instead of the old one about end of tape
handling]
I (and several others at least) have been seeing a problem with end of
tape error handling under linux. Instead of getting a ENOSPC, you get
a EIO error when you hit the end of the tape. This makes multivolume
backups kinda difficult.
Some more information on this problem was discovered by Tim Jones
<tjones@tolisgroup.com>:
Tim> Additional news.
Tim> This is actually related to the check sense bit not being

Tim> use a 2.2.19/20/21 or 22 kernel, or a 2.4.9-34 kernel Remove the

Tim>   tar -cvvf /dev/nst0 /etc
Tim> You will receive a "No medium found" message
Tim> Replace the kernel with 2.4.11+ and repeat the tar write test.
Tim> This time, you will receive a write failure.
Tim> This is caused by the check sense not being set and the ST driver
Tim> sending up a EIO instead of the ENOMEDIUM.
So, it looks like this problem is _not_ in the st driver itself, but
somewhere in the SCSI layer. 
Anyone have any ideas how to better track it down?
Happy to run debug code/test cases here.
