Hi Petr,

   I'm not sure how wise is updating drivers to the new interface now --
it's quite a moving target. Better wait several days before it stabilizes.

   You're right, it would be better to use <0 for errors. I'll change that.

   Currently, these hooks are not used at all.  They are intended to replace
the suspend/wakeup hooks of the original cardbus interface, but I still didn't
get to do it.

   Currently it cannot sleep as it's called from timer, but I hope this
will change soon.

   Currently they should be protected by the global kernel lock.
				Have a nice fortnight
