No offense taken.  I always encourage honesty in bug reports, even if 
that means I or my drivers get blown to pieces ;-)
I've had trouble finding test hardware I can play with for debugging, 
and haven't had time to review ALSA's driver in depth to evaluate the 
differences.  Patches are certainly welcome ;-)
[I need to attack the driver anyway, because I need to add VT8233 support]
