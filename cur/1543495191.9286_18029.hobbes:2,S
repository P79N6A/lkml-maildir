Yes.
So, now we all have made our points of view clear, let us
return to kernel and tunelp itself.
2.0.36 has
	#define LPSTRICT    0x060f
2.1.131 (and 2.2.*) has
	#define LPTRUSTIRQ  0x060f
This is a bug. It makes it a bit awkward to release an improved
tunelp, entirely regardless of who does the releasing, since
tunelp would have to check for the version of the running kernel,
and the man page would need a lengthy explanation.
Both ioctls are not precisely what seems to be needed,
but discussion of what is needed may take time, while resolution
of the ioctl conflict should happen as soon as possible.
As far as I know no software exists that uses LPSTRICT
(while Andrea's tunelp uses LPTRUSTIRQ) so probably no bad things
happen if we apply this patch to 2.0.36:

So far the immediate fix. (If it is applied then a corresponding
comment should be added to the 2.2.8 lp.h so that nobody will take
0x0610 later.)
In 2.0.35 some code was inserted to replace a waiting loop by
some code waiting for NBSY=0. People complained that the Epson 800
printer became terribly slow and in 2.0.36 the patch was reverted,
with an ioctl LPSTRICT to select the 2.0.35 behaviour.
The first question is: this 2.0.35 behaviour - is it strictly according
to the specs? Not according to my notes, which say:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Parallel port timing:
   1. wait for NBSY=1
   2. outb(data byte, data port)
   3. wait for at least 0.5us
   4. read control port, OR with STR=0x1, output to control port - purpose:
      generate strobe pulse; this will make the busy line go high
   5. wait for at least 0.5us
   6. read control port, AND with !STR, output to control port
   7. wait for at least 0.5us
   8. in a loop: read status register until NACK bit is 0 or NBSY=1
      (the printer will keep NACK=0 for at least 0.5us, then NACK=NBSY=1).
*/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 2.0.36 code I do not see any waiting for a definite period
of time - just strange loops like
	wait = 1000;
	while(wait) wait--;
with an execution time very much dependent on processor and alignment.
Andrea's code in 2.2.* looks much better.
