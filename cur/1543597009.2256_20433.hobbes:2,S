Subject: PCI_REGION_FLAG_MASK -- what is its meaning?

I looked at the PCI flags... I wonder where I get
information about the "bus specific bits"
I'm writing a driver for a proprietary PCI device and I'm
seeing:
region 0: address = e0000000, len = 4000000, use = 120c
region 1: address = 0, len = 0, use = 0
region 2: address = df800000, len = 100000, use = 1208
region 3: address = d8000000, len = 4000000, use = 1208
region 4: address = 0, len = 0, use = 0
region 5: address = 0, len = 0, use = 0
(I understand the upper bytes, what is the lower byte's meaning?)
