yes - look at Cray UNICOS. Besides resource limits there are also security
limits (MLS), fair-share limits (fading away now), project (project level
accounting) limits, a different set for batch and interactive (resource/project
limits). There is also an utility to generate/collate accounting records
into an extended accounting record for job level accounting.
Note: I want project level accounting separate from group access control.
The place I work has several projects that share group access to a given set
of files that is owned (and quota limited) to only one project. Files may
be created by all project members, with group access - but accounting for
each file/process is done to the specific project the user belongs to.
Now that Linux is reaching into the "supercomputer" range with beowuf
clusters, it is becoming more important to track (and justify) the usage
on large systems. If my site (a DoD shared resource center) were ever to
consider a cluser then we will have to be able to track (and report on)
this stuff.
