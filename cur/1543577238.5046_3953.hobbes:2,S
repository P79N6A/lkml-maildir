More aloud thinkin...
I have seen some times this thread appear on the list. One of the
problems: you will have to force drivers to register in two file
systems...
Perhaps there are tools yet to do what I'm thinkin of: a ghost file
system that just mirrors /proc, changing format of output.
Say you clone the procfs to a fake fs driver (for example, 
procfs.xml) that just translates each fs access system call to
/fproc/xml/path/to/file_or_dir (fproc==formatted proc)
to
/proc/path/to/file_or_dir
reads its contents and reformats them to give the desired output
(now thinkin on read-only, main people interest seems to be
in syntax-ing the out of /proc).
So actual /proc stays, not breaking anything, and theres a way
to write proc info formatters.
Even there could be many common code between all the possible
procfs.XXXX things to ease maintenance.
