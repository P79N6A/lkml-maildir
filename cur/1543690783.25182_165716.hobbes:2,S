And here's an even better reason to avoid ide-scsi in 2.6 (Jens sent 
this to the list, but I don't see it...):

Certainly that is true.  The system was nearly unresponsive at 16X (on 
2.4.18 SuSE) with my K6-2 400, but I can set it up to 32X now and I have 
no problems.  My recorder never hits 32X with my media though, maxes out 
at around 20X but I can browse the web while burning with absolutely no 
fear of my buffer running dry (probably helps that it's a 8MB buffer but 
cdrecord still never reports it being low).  That's a big change from 2.4.
