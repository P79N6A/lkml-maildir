Hmmm.. Nothing uses it at this point. I went through a series of get/kicks
during development. Some needed it. I suspect that we will need it when we 
implement reallocation instead of simply reclaiming. It is also necessary
if we get into the situation where we want to optimize the reclaim. At 
that point the kick method needs to know how far get() got before the 
action was aborted in order to fix up only certain refcounts.

Its described in slab.h
