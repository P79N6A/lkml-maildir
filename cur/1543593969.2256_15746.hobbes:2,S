I'm _not_ working on that side of things. Let's not add that into the
mix, OK? If you look at inode.c changes you'll see that the only thing
they expect from __sync_one() is to retake inode_lock before moving the
inode from the locked list. Other than that patch doesn't know and
doesn't care about fsync() semantics and implementation.
We have enough fun on the superblock side of the business. Let's keep
the fsync() stuff separate - they are pretty much orthogonal to each
other.
Right now I don't want to open that can of worms. Sorry.
