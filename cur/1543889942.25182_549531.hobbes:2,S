Hi,

Yes, the machine spends its time waiting for the disk to do its things
as it does not have anything else to do. Nothing to worry about. If
you want, launch some CPU bound process at the same time and the wait
time will be replaced by some user+system time but you'll gain
nothing.
Hope this helps.
