Coming from you, the Aunt Tillie argument doesn't make more sense than
it did coming from ESR.
The actual problem existed before select just as it does afterwards.
People have to search extensively though Kconfig files to come up with
a useful .config.  Before people had to magically know that
USB_STORAGE requires SCSI.  "Magically" because USB_STORAGE didn't
show up in either make menuconfig, make xconfig or .config.  Now
people have to magically know that SCSI=n requires USB_STORAGE=n.
You have the exact same problem and it has nothing to do with Aunt
Tillie.
What this shows is that select was a bad idea, as it merely shifted
the problem around instead of fixing it.  It appears as if Stefan is
looking in the right direction for a decent fix and I'd like to see
patches from him.  If only to stop these bad analogies ESR tried to
argue with. :)
