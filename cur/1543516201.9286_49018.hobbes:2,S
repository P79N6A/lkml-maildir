Hi guys,
I'm looking for a tool that is able to report the configuration
of a whole system (network, users, security, ...). I wrote
very basic scripts for getting that when I thought:
- Maybe someone else wrote something close to my needs
- I was not able to report in a friendly way the kernel 2.2 parameters
If you can help, specifically for a kernel report tool, would be nice.
Many Thanks for your help.
