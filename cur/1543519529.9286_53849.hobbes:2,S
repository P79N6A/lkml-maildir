WHY THE H*LL DOES GLIBC CONTINUE TO INCLUDE LINUX KERNEL HEADER FILES?
Stop it NOW.
We had this discussion with the old libc5, where we due to historical
reasons did the inclusion of kernel header files into user space. And one
of the things glibc was supposed to do was to stop doing that!
The user-space library header files have to match the LIBRARY, not the
kernel. 
This is not open for discussion. The reason I ended up hating libc5 doing
it was that it broke every once in a while when the kernel was
re-organized. I thought we had gotten past that with glibc.
If the glibc people cannot figure out how "cp" works, maybe somebody
should tell them. Symlinks are a maintenance nightmare, and means that not
only does the user-space compilation environment suddenly depend on which
version of the kernel sources you have installed (as opposed to which one
you're _running_), but they also mean that suddenly you have to install
the kernel sources to compile anything (or split up the kernel sources
into "headers" and "the rest"). Which means that package management is
screwed up etc etc.
I refuse to add more of the __KERNEL__ stupidity. The existing stuff is
there for backwards compatibility, but the thing stops here.
