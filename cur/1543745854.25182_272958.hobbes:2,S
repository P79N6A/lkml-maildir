Yes. But in this case, my suggestion _is_ the good. You seem to be pushing 
for a really horrid thing which allocates a per-cpu array for each 
mm_struct. 
What is it that you have against the per-thread rss? We already have 
several places that do the thread-looping, so it's not like "you can't do 
that" is a valid argument.
