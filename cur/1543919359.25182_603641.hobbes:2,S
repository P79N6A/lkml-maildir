Thanks a lot for tracking this down.  Does changing the above code fix
your problem?
Jens, Torsten's analysis looks correct && depending on qc state (n_iter)
during iteration doesn't look like a good idea.  Those iterators are not
supposed to have side effects.  Would it be difficult to implement
sg_last() test?

I have no idea why it fails only sometimes.
