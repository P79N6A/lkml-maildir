NT doesn't run anything for more than a day. It stays up, but the
applications always stop. This is considered "normal" by M$. Even
M$'s C++ environment needs to be rebooted between compiles or it
won't link.
Running a benchmark for a month will guarantee that even a CP/M
machine will beat NT in overall performance, even if the database
is on 96k, hard-sectored, single-sided floppies that have to be
changed by hand.
