Subject: 2.2.10 fs corruption, reply if I can be of help

This may be a repeat; this may be noise.  Hopefully not.
Running the 2.2.10 kernel with AIC7xxx support, I noticed 2 strange fs
corruption incidents:
The first was just plain corruption; I rebooted a machine after about 2
days of uptime, and even though it was a clean unmount, fsck yelled about
corruption.  After reading kernel notes about corruption, tried the reboot
again, and got the same thing....
The more interesting case was during an FTP; I had a tar image of about
500M (actually, a tar of RH6.0).  Consistently, on the same byte at around
250M (sorry, didn't write it down...), I would get a message "input/output
error" while ftp'ing the file redhat.tar.  I tried 3 times; always the
same problem.  I logged into the machine and was able to successfully "cp
redhat.tar redhat.tar.2", but when I initiated a final attempt, from a
third, independent machine, at ftp'ing the original "redhat.tar", I got
the same probelem.  A reboot cured the problem; unfortunately, the machine
is headless, so I did not notice if fsck complained (I think not, it came
up quickly).  But the problem won't happen now.
I know this is flaky, I wasn't thinking of writing a bug report while it
was happening.  Unfortunately, the machines this was happening on are our
main development machines, so we can't afford to play around (I put 2.2.5 
on them, that looks stable like it has a stable fs according to kernel
notes, no?)
So, I hope this helps in some way.  If not, sorry to add to the noise....
Write if I can help at all.
