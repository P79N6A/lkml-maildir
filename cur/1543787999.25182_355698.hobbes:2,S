Since the voltage goes down as the speed increases, an
industry joke has been that at 0 volts you can get the
speed that you want. Unfortunately, the required infinite
current is a bit hard to manage. This brings up the
configuration change that has been in the works for
some time, current-mode logic. Just like TTL gave way
to ECL to obtain two orders of magnitude increase in
random-logic speed, there will be a similar increase once
current rather than voltage is used for logic levels.
And, it's not absolute current, either but delta-current
which will define a logic state.
The problems with reducing capacity end up being exacerbated
when logic states are stored in the very capacity that is
being reduced. Eventually there is little difference between
"logic" and "noise". This brings up the new science of
"statistical logic" which has yet to make its way into
microprocessors, but soon will once the quantization noise
becomes a factor.
