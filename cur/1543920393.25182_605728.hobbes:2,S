To fill in a few details.  This was triggered in the middle of a
kernbench run on the machine.  A job with just dbench runs in it ran to
completion.  The machine is a 4 node numa x86_64 system.
Seems that most schedular options are on:
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y
CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED=y
At the moment we don't have any historical jobs back from 2.6.23 so I
cannot be more specific as to when it arrived in mainline.  The x86/x86_64
merge broke our build process; a bad assumption here, not a problem with
the merge.
