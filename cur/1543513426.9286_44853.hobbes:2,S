Well, as the post that started this thread clearly stated (by the topic,
and in the post itself) that the kernel in question WAS v2.2.13pre18, the
change obviously didn't work, in fact, the post said that 2.2.13pre17
worked fine while 2.2.13pre18 didn't.
I still think that the heap-size change is necessary, and I have a hard
time seeing any possible problems it could cause.
