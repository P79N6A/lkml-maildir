Whoa...you mean it actually worked for you in 2.3 at some point? :)
I haven't been able to get my DC290 to work at all, and I've _always_
been having a problem similar to what you just posted.
How long has it been working for you?  What kernels have worked?  Do you
have anything else on your USB bus(es) other than the camera?
