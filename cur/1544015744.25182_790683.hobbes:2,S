This version seems worse in so many ways.
You made the mutex bigger, for no obvious reason.
You made it back into the locked version.
You have unnecessary preempt_enable/preempt_disable calls in functions 
that need to be called (and are called) with preemption already disabled.
Things seem to be going backwards.
