           Hey people, i`ve got such a thought
    not long ago:
      all boxes are different, but the /proc/sys/vm
      defaults are equal for every people, so there
      is a good issue in getting more performance
      from linux, just by making a way to autoadjust
      these mysterious values according to amount of
      RAM/swap and speed of CPU!  Or this can be done 
      in userspace with an utility which look also 
      on the field of box` use (eg workstation, server        etc...)
          But who can make this better than the people        who hack the kernel?
          And i wonder why such a issue is not clearly        covered? (maybe i`m making mistake?)
          This can also be done for proc/sys/net/*...
