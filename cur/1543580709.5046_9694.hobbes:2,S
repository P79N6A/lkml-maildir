unfortunately, it's not limited to redhat and it's not limited to
redhat's gcc-2.96.  gcc-2.95.2 has some bugs (a certain strength
reduction bug comes to mind).  no new official gcc has come for over a
year.  many distributions have applied a patch to fix the strength
reduction bug.  do they all alter their version number?  of those that
do, do they alter it consistently?
