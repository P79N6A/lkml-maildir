This morning my dual P2/300 with 320MB memory gave me:
NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on CPU0, registers:
CPU:    0
EPI:    0023:[<08076580>]
EFLAGS: 00000292
eax: fb54ba8e   ebx: bba692c5   ecx: b6fb4d53   edx: 562a18f5
esi: 216266e2   edi: 92811b25   ebp: 27cd9569   esp: 080f0148
ds: 002b   es: 002b   ss: 002b
Process dnetc (pid: 1136, stackpage=ce0f7000)
console shuts up ...
It is running 2.4.0-ac9.  I was trying to read some files NFS mounted 
from a rh6.2 machine.  (I don't know if that has anything to do with it.)
Any ideas?  None of the SAR-xx codes worked.  Reset button was necessary.
