   1) Can - whether the user program use Framebuffer
	Directly (etc. memcpy ()) or only through FB API?
The framebuffer API doesn't provide any functions for writing to the
framebuffer, actually.  At least not AFAIK.  In general, you must
mmap() the framebuffer device and write to it yourself.
   2) It is possible - whether to cause from a kernel (for example: at
   initialization FB) int 0x10 ( vesa bios )?
       And if that is possible how?
Yes.  Use the vga= command-line parameter in conjunction with vesafb.
