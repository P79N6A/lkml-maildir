Subject: 2.6.0-test3 module compilation
I am trying to compile a module on 2.6.0-test3 kernel. The makefile i
am using is a pretty normal one : 
CFLAGS = -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -I/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test3/include -O
dummy.o: dummy.c
The module i am trying to compile is taken from the kernel itself
(dummy network device driver). The
compilation works flawlessly but when i try to insert the module i get
: invalid module format.
What am i doing wrong because i have modutils and module-init and both
work, since the same module (dummy)
compiled with the kernel itself can be inserted and removed without
the previous error message.
Is there something i should know about the compilation process ? The
kernel-compiled module (dummy.ko) has
about 10 Kbytes and dummy.ko compiled by me has only 2 Kbytes :(
Thank you in advance
