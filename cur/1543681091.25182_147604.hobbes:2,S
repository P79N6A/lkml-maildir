I think I have seen it somewhere but forgot.
Is it possible to create a noop macro that makes compiler believe macro 
arguments are used? I mean the case of debug macro that for debug off is 
redefined as something like do { } while(0) but then if arguments are used 
for debugging purposes only compiler emits warning. Some people do not like 
it :)
TIA
