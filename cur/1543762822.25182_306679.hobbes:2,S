yes, if you want to run application like openoffice.org you need at
least 200Mo. If you want that your system is usable, you need at least 40 process per user. So 40*200 = 8Go, and it don't think you have all this memory...
I think per user limit could be a solution.
attached a small fork-memory bombing.
