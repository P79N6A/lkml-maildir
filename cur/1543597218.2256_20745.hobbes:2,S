If the message looks like it's getting as far as the messages file, but getting
corrupt by the lockup, what about configuring syslog to send the messages over
the net to another machine.  Maybe it will get the UDP packet out before the
lockup.  Also, this could be done without rebooting the machine.  Might be
worth a try first.
