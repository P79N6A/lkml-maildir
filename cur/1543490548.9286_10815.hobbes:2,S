I guess that could be changed to use the queue() function, with unplug_device
getting a parameter specifying which device is to be unplugged, but we would
need to `allocate' plug_tq's from somewhere rather than just statically
associating one with each major device.
(Also, raid5.c seems to be wanting to muck about with unplug_device: it's
currently inside of a #if 0).
