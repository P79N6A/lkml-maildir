... which can be turned back into
 	1,C,A	x = load()
 	1,C,A	x' = x | 2;
 	1,C,A	cmpxchg(x,x') [success]
 	3,C,A	...
which will fail and retry in exactly the same contention cases as the
LL/SC.  The only thing that LL gives you that's nice is a hint that
an SC is due very soon and so resisting a cache eviction for a couple
of cycles might be a good idea.
The reason that we tend to do the former is optimism that the lock
won't be held.  If that's a bad assumption, make it more pessimistic.
LL/SC can detect double changes during the critical section, but it's
very similar in expressive power to load + CMPXCHG.
