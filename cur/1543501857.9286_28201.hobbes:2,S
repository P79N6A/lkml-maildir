The kernel tree is a collection of related documents.
One could abuse a compound document system to store
source code, but that would be a lousy idea. Source
code doesn't have many of the normal document-like
properties. For example:
There isn't a well-defined and obvious way to print the
whole thing.
Nobody would think of just cut-and-pasting the whole kernel
source into another project. Going the other way is also a
silly concept.
One wouldn't embed a spreadsheet document into the kernel.
One wouldn't embed a kernel source tree into a spreadsheet.
