I started to - but had no idea what pci_resource_end() would correspond to. I'm guessing it's "cookie + N" where N is the size of the BAR. However, this seems really odd and would only be used to calculate the size of N. I figured someone actually in tune with the pci subsytem was better qualified to write the summary.
