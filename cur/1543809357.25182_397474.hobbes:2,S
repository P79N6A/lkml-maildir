OK, with 2.6.16-rc2-mm1, "ls" bounces around between 0.15s and 0.50s.
Better than mainline but the large seemingly random variance is still
perceptible and annoying.  And, "ls | cat" behaves about the same as
"ls", while on mainline it was consistently faster (!).
Do you have an updated patch against -mm that I can test?
