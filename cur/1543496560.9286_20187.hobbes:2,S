I'm using a univeristy of helsinki version, with some of my own changes
(get rid of legacy "termio.c" and replace with a "posix.c" etc). 
I made a tar.gz file and put it on ftp.kernel.org. I do _not_ intend to
claim that this is a particularly good version of uemacs - it's just the
one I use, and it has seen some development that makes it better than some
other versions I have seen. Caveat emptor.
