    I didn't check is (and I am not at home right now), but according to the
    fdisk output it should be on.

    No. If I boot 2.0.36 everything works again.

    I never added it before.
Now that I see some more linux-kernel messages, there are
several people who complain that the SCSI detection code
for the aic7xxx was broken in pre5. No doubt your problem
has the same cause.
