In order to do separate source and object correctly, kbuild 2.5
enforces the rule that #include "" comes from the local directory,
#include <> comes from the include path.  include/linux/zlib.h
incorrectly does #include "zconf.h" instead of #include <linux/zconf.h>,
breaking the rules.
This was not detected by common-2.5.20-1 because the nostdinc check was
incomplete, common-2.5.20-2 does nostdinc correctly.  I avoid changing
the source code for kbuild 2.5, instead I workaround these incorrect
includes by adding extra_cflags() with FIXME comments to correct the
code later.  I will do a common-2.5.20-3 to workaround zlib.h, in the
meantime try this quick and dirty fix
