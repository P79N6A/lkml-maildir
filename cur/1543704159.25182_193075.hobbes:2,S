hi,
my notebook (hp/compaq nx7000) still crashes when using 8139cp (runs
rock solid with 8139too driver). The computer just locks up, there is no
dmesg output. This has happened since I've got this laptop (around
november '03).
8139too outputs:
| 8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.27
| 8139too: pci dev 0000:02:01.0 (id 10ec:8139 rev 20) is an enhanced 8139C+ chip
| 8139too: Use the "8139cp" driver for improved performance and stability.
| 8139too: 0000:02:01.0: unknown chip version, assuming RTL-8139
| 8139too: 0000:02:01.0: TxConfig = 0x74800000
the "Use the.." line is rather annoying..
lspci lists:
02:01.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 20)
