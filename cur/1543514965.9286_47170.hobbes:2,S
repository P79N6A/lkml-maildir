Hmm...  I still have an H+ in a box somewhere which I ditched when I got a Dxr2 -
the H+ software crashed on half the DVDs I tried it on & the front end software
was crap.  I'm surprised Creative have gone that way.. oh well...
Drivers for the H+ would be nice, but Sigma designs aren't going to release Linux
drivers (they have publicly stated this) since the CSS decryption needs to be done
is software & they are covered by NDA with it.  I suppose it's possible Creative might
break ranks and release the H+ specs anyway (I wouldn't hold your breath though).
