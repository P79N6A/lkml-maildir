Unfortunately I have to fix it on this version (the bug was found on 
shipped product), so if there was a difference I'd have to isolate the 
changes and backport them.  Also, I can't run the software that triggers 
the problem on a newer kernel as it has dependencies on various patches 
that are not in mainline.
Basically what I'd like to know is whether calling schedule() in 
seq_read() is safe or whether it would break assumptions made by 
seq_file users.
