By having the copy routine sit elsewhere. You can have the copy routine
be in a known location of the kernel beeing resumed (that is it uses
its own copy routine) that is aligned on a page boundary and knows how
to copy itself. Fairly trivial.

Why ? You aren't passing any device/driver information from the boot
kernel and the resumed one... do you ?

Then you don't wnat to do things properly...
