I think that's an very important point.  We have a chance to get that
non-fanout filesystems right quite easily - something I wished that would
have been done before the ecryptfs merge - while getting fan-out stackable
filesystems is a really hard task.  In addition to that I know exactly
one fan-out stackable filesystem that is posisbly useful, which is unionfs.
Because of that I'm much more inclined to add VFS asistance for this
particular problem (unioning) instead of adding complex infrastructure
to solve a general problem that people don't benefit from.
