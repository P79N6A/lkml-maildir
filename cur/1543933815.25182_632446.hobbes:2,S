I think a broken-up patch series isn't totally wrong to do for a first
look at these RFC patches.  Of course the series needs to become a
single patch before it is committed to a tree whose history needs to
support bijection, e.g. -mm.
However, Dave's postings lack a References: header which refer to his
00/12 posting.
(Also, a bonus in the 00/12 posting would be a listing of all patch
titles in the series and the total diffstat of the series, but nearly
nobody does this.)
