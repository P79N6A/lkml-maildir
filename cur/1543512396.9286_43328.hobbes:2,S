	Err, no, /proc/devices isn't a filesystem, it's a FILE.  The idea
being it's a list of major,minor's that are in the system, or perhaps
something like:
+8,0
+8,1
+8,2
+8,4
-8,1
+8,3
	Where a proggie can then read the file and determine what is 
currently in the system, and by watching the file can see what devices are
added/removed.  NOTE: This is just a random thought on the layout, it prolly
has lots of problems so don't think I'm suggesting it as a permanent
solution.
	At least, this is my understand of the current thoughts going around
on this...
