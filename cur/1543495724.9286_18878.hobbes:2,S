No, but after reading the source , I'm pretty sure that update is not
needed with 2.2.8. The comments in the code say something like :
" I plan to patch /sbin/update to just exit in this case"
BUT !   The code might not be bugfree and has been reversed to old
state in kernel 2.2.9.
So I suggest using 2.2.9 and leaving /sbin/update as is.
Any comments from the "experts" ?
