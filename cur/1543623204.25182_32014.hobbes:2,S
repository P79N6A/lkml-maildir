 | This is an updated patch for SCx200 support.  This patch is against
 | linux-2.4.19-pre2 and adds support for some SCx200 specific features
 | such as the GPIO pins, the watchdog and flash mapping via the DOCCS
 | pin.  Compared to the earlier patch, I've cleaned up a few more
 | things, and have also added a driver for the ACCESS.bus found in the
 | SCx200 CPUs.
There's a typo in drivers/i2c/Config.in.
CONFIG_SCx200_I2C is defined but CONFIG_I2C_SCx200 is tested...
+      dep_tristate '  NatSemi SCx200 I2C using GPIO pins' CONFIG_SCx200_I2C $CONFIG_ARCH_SCx200 $CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT
+      if [ "$CONFIG_I2C_SCx200" != "n" ]; then
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     this should be CONFIG_SCx200_I2C
