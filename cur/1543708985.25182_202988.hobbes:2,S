Linux washing powder has been around for some time if I remember correctly, 
never used it though. ;)
Afaik, the name is ok, because the trademark Linux does not apply here. At 
least in Germany it is registered in the category "computer'n'stuff" 
(someting like that afaik) so selling Linux washing powder should be 
perfectly fine, no roalties having to to be paid. But then IANAL and at least 
I thought this was how it works. Feel free to correct me if I was wrong as 
I'd be interested in it myself.
Bye,
Oliver
