Subject: [PATCH v6 0/5] Add preadv & pwritev system calls.

  Hi folks,
Next round of the preadv & pwritev patch series.  Had no review comments
to fix.  That means it is ready to be merged, right?
Changes:
 - compat_sys_{read,write}v bugfix patch dropped (merged).
 - rebase to latest git, adapt to CVE-2009-0029 changes.
How to proceed now?  Is there a syscall maintainer where I could queue
up the patches?  If not, anyone (akpm?) willng to pick this up?  Should
I try to send to Linus directly?
What is the usual way to handle the arch-specific syscall windup?  I'd
prefer to leave that to the arch maintainers as they know best what
needs to be done, is that ok?  Right now only x86 (/me) and mips (patch
from Ralf Baechle) is covered ...
cheers,
  Gerd
