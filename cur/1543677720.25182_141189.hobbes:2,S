Binary interface's will never cut it.  Read the hotplug thread to see how Linus
said, he will never add a binary event daemon interface.
That said, there is an oppurtunity for to provide a ascii interface (similar to
/sbin/hotplug) decodes the data from the rtnetlink interface in a standardized format.
Then it would be easy to write things like perl monitoring scripts that do things
like:
	perl phone-me-if-network-dies.pl < /proc/net/events
Don't flame me about the choce of name. /proc/net/events is not the right name 
to use for such an interface since adding more to /proc is probably not desired.
