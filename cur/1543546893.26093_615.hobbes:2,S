Hi,
I tried your script many times today and was unable to induce deadlock
with or without other things running.. iozone, updatedb etc.
However :-) you want to see something really odd?  The below reliably
fails in a 1024 blocksize fs but passes fine in a 4096 blocksize fs.  I
can't see anything inside the driver that can possibly cause this weird
failure.  With a 1k blocksize, it always begins to choke as swap kicks
in.  It works fine as a single process compile regardless of blocksize.

#!/bin/bash
# Run with PWD in 1024 blocksize fs.. then try it with 4096 blocksize.
# Adjust $KICKMEBEATMEMAKEMEBLEED to swap heartily.. but not insanely.
# 30 works well on my 128mb box, YMMV.
