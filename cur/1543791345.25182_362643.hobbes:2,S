Hi Christoph,
This patch (commit 9c0cbd54ce0397017a823484f9a8054ab369b8a2) removed the
COMPATIBLE_IOCTL bits for TIOCSTART and TIOCSTOP because they are
unimplemented.  The result is that the first 50 times you type ^C at a
bash prompt (on ppc64 at least) you get a nice message in your syslog (and
on your console):
ioctl32(bash:3527): Unknown cmd fd(2) cmd(2000746e){' '} arg(00000000) on /dev/pts/0
Because bash (on ppc64 at least) does a TIOCSTART ioctl when ^C is
pressed.  The ioctl always returned EINVAL but now we also get the log
message.  Should we put the COMPATIBLE_IOCTL bits back?
