Hello,
I'm definitely no native English speaker, but I wanted to give my pov

Agreed. Once you have loaded such a module, your kernel is really
"tainted" by something that cannot really be controlled.
Proprietary is too much neutral and doesn't reflect what you are
now running : some piece of code which may by bloated without anyone
being able to control it.

Correct.

Agreed too.
This patch should make its way in the kernel, so that people are
aware they are using closed-source code.
I simply hope that some "vendors" will not alter kernel code before
building to remove such a warning if they include closed source
module in their distro.
