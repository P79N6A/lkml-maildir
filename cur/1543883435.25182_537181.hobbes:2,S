Problem is that even if we read the MMCONFIG table location from the 
hardware registers, that doesn't mean we can trust the result. It could 
be that the BIOS hasn't lied about where it put the table, it just stuck 
it someplace completely unsuitable like on top of RAM or other 
registers. It seems that with some of those 965 chipsets the latter is 
what the BIOS is actually doing, and so when we think we're writing to 
the table we're really writing to random chipset registers and hosing 
things. (Jesse Barnes ran into this while trying to add chipset support 
for the 965).
Likely what we need to do is:
-If chipset is known, take table address from registers, otherwise check 
the MCFG table
-Take the resulting area (Ideally not just the first minimum part as we 
check now, but the full area based on the expected length) and make sure 
that the entire area is covered by a reservation in ACPI motherboard 
resources.
-If that passes, then we still need to sanity check the result by making 
sure it hasn't been mapped over top of something else important. How to 
do this depends on exactly how they've set up the ACPI reservations on 
these broken boxes.. Does someone have a full dmesg from one on a recent 
kernel that shows all the pnpacpi resource reservation output?
-If these checks fail, we don't use the table, and the chipset is known, 
we should likely try to disable decoding of the region so that it won't 
get in the way of anything else.
The current check we have really should go, though. It only excludes 
these broken chipsets based on luck, not on anything that is guaranteed, 
and ends up disabling the table on systems where it's perfectly functional.

Yeah, if we can do this part of MMCONFIG initialization later that would 
likely be a better solution.
