2.6.17-rc1 fails in the same fashion - it hangs "randomly".
Good news that I've found the pattern and solution:
it always happens when 2 applications open /dev/dsp simultaneously.
Applying the following patches published by Takashi Iwai solves the
problem:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114423578508165&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114424198614019&w=2
Not sure if the first one is enough.
I would probably recommend to put them into the hot-fixes,
since many people can be frustrated because of this.
