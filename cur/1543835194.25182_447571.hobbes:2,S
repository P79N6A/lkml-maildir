In the T43, very recent BIOS, it is inside _SB_.PCI0.LPC.SIO, where _HID is
PNP0C02, and it holds resources to a number of different devices.  Port 1600
is not even in a block by itself, it is in a block that reserves 0x42 bytes,
while the EC occupies just 0x1600-0x161F.

Tell that to the vendors...

I very much doubt you can pull that off, but if anyone has good contacts
within IBM/Lenovo's ThinkPad notebook division, we could try.  Heck, the
Thinkpad community have *firmware* fixes to send them and no channel
whatsoever to send a report to engineering.  Lenovo support doesn't let you
report something like that, unlike, say, Intel's.

The table (within the driver, for whitelisting) has exactly *one* substring
for string match, that works for all models since the A31, and maybe even
earlier ones.  The OEM string table used by IBM is quite stable.
