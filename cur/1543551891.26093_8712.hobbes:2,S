Ought to, but we mostly only rewrite addresses like that inside loops.
You might be able to convince CSE to massage that sort of thing, but I

It would be cool though -- get everything into direct offset form as
much as possible might even make it easier to transform it all back
to autoinc if the target supports that sort of thing.
