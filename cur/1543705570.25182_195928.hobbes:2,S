I am running a 2.4.24 system with grsecurity-1.9.13-2.4.24.patch and
patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22-rc2.0. The problem I just discovered is that
after I enabled a iptables rule to log incoming --syn packets on feb 1st,
the machine stopped logging to any of the files in /var/log after about half
a day. I remembered that iptables logs seem to show in dmesg command in the
past, and sure enough, they are all showing up there no problems, but not in
any files, including dmesg.log.
I have attached my .config as well. I havent tried rebooting or restarting
network yet just in case I get some suggestions or things to try while I
have the borked behaviour. If you have any ideas, please drop me a line,
thanks guys.
