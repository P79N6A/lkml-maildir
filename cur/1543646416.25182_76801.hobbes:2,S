AFAIR fixed in Linus' BK tree.

The problem that was causing it is that "make modules" didn't stop when
the compilation of imm.c and ppa.c failed. The bug in the build system and
the compilation of these two files are fixed in Linus' BK tree.

Already fixed in Linus' BK tree.
Please wait for 2.5.41 and check whether any problems will be present in
this kernel.
