Hi all,
I have worked with Hannu on the 3dfx driver since almost the beginning, but
nowadays he seems to be unreachable.
So, I've decided to make a new version of the driver for the 2.4 kernel
branch, and release it.
It contains many new features. I use this driver for about two month, so
IMHO it's stable enough to use.
You can download it from
