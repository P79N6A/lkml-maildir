Perhaps the enclosed bash shell script will help here - set it up with
cron to run through all the lists of who is subscribed once a day,
with stdout emailed to you, and stderr redirected to /dev/null, and
you should get a list of any and all suspicious entries for you to
check...
Note also that one run of the command can scan ALL of the database
files, as it will work its way through its parameters treating each of
them as a separate file to process, and will process them in the order
they are given. Assuming the various databases are all stored in the
directory /var/mailling-lists/ then the following cron command would
do this for you quite happily:
	checkdomain /var/mailling-lists/* 2> /dev/null
This program assumes that the subscription database is one entry per
line, with the email address as the first thing on each line and the
rest of the line containing what it regards as comment info. It allows
leading spaces or tabs on each line, and also allows either spaces or
tabs to separate the email address from the comment info.
For reference, here's a test database I used:
 Q> rhw@memalpha.cx		Valid
 Q>   rhw@memalpha.cx		Valid
 Q> rhw memalpha.cx		Invalid - no domain part.
 Q> rhw@ memalpha.cx		Invalid - no domain part.
 Q> rhw@memalpha .cx		Invalid - domain not fully qualified.
 Q> root@localhost		Invalid - domain not fully qualified.
 Q> root@localhost.localdomain	Invalid - domain not found.
 Q> root@warez.memalpha.cx	Invalid - maps to 127.0.0.1.
The comments on each one state whether it should be mapped as valid or
invalid, and if invalid, why. Note that it won't find entries in
/etc/hosts as it uses the host command to search for them, and it also
regards anything that maps to 127.0.0.1 as being invalid, so localhost
would have been invalid on that basis even if it had passed the host
test in the first place.
Here's what appears on stdout from running the above through the
script...
 Q> Analysing xx gives:
 Q>  => Missing domain:       <rhw>  (memalpha.cx Invalid)
 Q>  => Missing domain:       <rhw@>  (memalpha.cx Invalid)
 Q>  => Invalid domain:       <rhw@memalpha>  (.cx Invalid)
 Q>  => Invalid domain:       <root@localhost>  (Invalid)
 Q>  => Unknown host:         <root@localhost.localdomain>  (Invalid)
 Q>  => Maps as LocalHost:    <root@warez.memalpha.cx>  (Invalid)
 Q> 
There's quite a bit that gets sent to stderr, but that can all be
disposed of by redirecting that to /dev/null - it's only used for
copyright and debugging information, not for problem reports.

Better still, an automated means of doing so will help...

Hopefully this will get to you before you go...
