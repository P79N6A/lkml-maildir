The latest changes include a bunch of updates to inline comments and a fix for
(yet another) stupid error I introduced.  Next up on my todo list so people
know (especially if they want to help) is seeing if there's any way to
reduce the includes in all of these files.  After that I guess I'll send
individual patches off to any current maintainers, and just tag which files
are unmaintained, and then see about syncing up 2.4 and 2.5.
