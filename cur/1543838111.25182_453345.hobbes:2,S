People might not complain until this is for some time in a released 
kernel.
Why don't you check yourself?
  grep -r __GNUC__ *
  grep -r cc-version *
There are over 100 results, but it's easy to spot the few requiring a

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
