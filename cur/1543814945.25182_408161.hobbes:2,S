Define "database".  And explain how any of existing filesystems manages
to _not_ qualify your definition.
As for "more efficient"...  300 lookups per second is less than an
improvement.  It's orders of magnitude worse than e.g. ext2; I don't
know in which world that would be considered more efficient, but I
certainly glad that I don't live there.
