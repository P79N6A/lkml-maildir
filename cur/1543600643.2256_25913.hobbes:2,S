Hello...
I just noticed that i can inside my BIOS switch from MPS (Multi
Processor Specification ?) 1.1 to 1.4, the later is noticed as "for
future use", but when i enable it, the kernel says in dmesg that he
found a MPS 1.4...so it seems to work, at least it claims to.
Question:
Whats the difference between MPS 1.1 and 1.4 from Kernel-sight, the
system (ASUS P2B-DS, now Dual PIII/850/100 and 2.4.3, RH7.1) ran 2 years
with MPS 1.1 and PIII/450/100-CPUs on Kernel 2.2.12, so i see no need to
flip this switch and go to MPS 1.4...or does it make sense with the
2.4.x Kernels now ?
Interesting is that with MPS 1.1 the Kernel puts three devices (aic7xxx,
usb-uhci and eth0) on IRQ 10, with MPS 1.4 it puts the same three
devices on IRQ 19...so there seems to be difference.
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
