Of course that changes register usage, register spilling,
and thus ultimately even the stack layout. :-(
Adjusting gcc flags to eliminate optimizations is another way to go.
Adding -fwrapv would be an excellent start. Lack of this flag breaks
most code which checks for integer wrap-around. The compiler "knows"
that signed integers don't ever wrap, and thus eliminates any code
which checks for values going negative after a wrap-around. I could
imagine this affecting a switch() or other jump table.
