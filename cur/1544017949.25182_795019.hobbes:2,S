I've uploaded the debug info here:
  
http://disenchant.net/tmp/bug-12465/
Some interesting sections should be around these times:
  01:36:04 -> 01:36:27
  01:37:30 -> 01:37:42
  01:37:52 -> 01:37:56
  01:39:37 -> 01:39:40
  01:40:01 -> 01:40:14
The output from ping is there too so you can see how the delays usually
show up (e.g. in clusters). The large debug file runs from before I
launched the VMs, right through the ping test. The trimmed file just
cuts out everything before I started ping.

Kevin.
