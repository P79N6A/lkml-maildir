I get similar hangs.  Here's from make menuconfig, down to
"Architecture-independent feature selections" and try to turn modules to N.
As soon as I hit N...it hang for 60 sec and then bombs with...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cml2/cmlconfigure.py", line 3283, in ?

When I tried it from make oldconfig.  It didn't hang it just took a long time
to configure hundreds of modules to Y...just what I didn't want, but we've
talked about that.
