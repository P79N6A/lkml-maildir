In my message above, I specifically asked about any one area, asking if 
there was parallel development in that area.  So far, noone has said "yes".
If the answer was "yes", somebody in your fanin (nice ascii, BTW :) is
merging.  So the answer is either
	noone => no parallel development in any one area
or
	someone
If it is "someone", who is it?
