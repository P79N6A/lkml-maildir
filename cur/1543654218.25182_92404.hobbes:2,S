Move the "mcore-y := mach-default" assignment above the
block that deal with subarch. Then you do not need the "ifndef ..."
I recall that Linus previously have asked for shell commands
when moving files - so consider including only the patch below and
then a number of "mv arch/i386/X include/....".
This makes it much more visible what you actually change.
Another alternative it to do it in bitkeeper, then it is visible
from the cset that you move files (use bk mv).
