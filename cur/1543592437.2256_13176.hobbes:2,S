Hi!
...is broken. If imagesize is 0xf123, bootsect_second only returns
0xf000 in ax, which is < 0xf123, so it continues loading. Then,
bootsect_second returns 0x10000, but it is 16 bit register, so it is
0x0000, and that's also < 0xf123. So it is looping forever.
It can be fixed like this: (Another possible workaround is to set max
size in tools/misc.c to 0xefff instead of 0xffff. OTOH it would be
nice to be able to boot images up to 2.88MB directly from floppy).
