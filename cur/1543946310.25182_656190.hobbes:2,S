Subject: Intel Core2Duo mobile - how does the VID get set?

After a fair bit of Googling and reading around, I'm none the wiser 
about exactly how Linux 2.6.x sets the processor VID (or for that matter 
how it decides the FID settings) when using the ondemand governor and 
cpufreq stuff.
Can anyone tell me a) whether this is obtained from the BIOS, something 
in the MSR of the processor or elsewhere and b) whether there is an 
interface in /proc or /sys where one can find out what is set and modify it?
I'm not subscribed to the list so a Cc: would be appreciated, cheers!
