What overhead of instability of highmem?  Sorry folks but this is utter
bollocks.  Back in the Caldera days we did a lot of measurement on highmem
overhead, and CONFIG_HIGHMEM has no measurable overhead at all on a system
that doesn't use it.  CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G on the other hand has
a quite visible overhead on small systems, but that's entirely due to the
bigger page table entries that you need for NX.
