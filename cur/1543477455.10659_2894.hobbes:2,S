It's in linux/fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c: there's a translation "between nfs
status return values and the local errno values which may not be the
same" (quotes indicate code comments).
If it runs into something it couldn't look up in the table then it spits
out this error message.  I've seen it a fair number of times myself....
