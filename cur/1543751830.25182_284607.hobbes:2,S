The above would be the patch I posted here
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=125890
 the reason I went for the lazy approach is mainly that I tried to look into the
 usage of -ENXIO vs -ENODEV, but just grepping in drivers/video/*.c turned out
 to be confusing rather than enlightening... should *all* -ENXIO be converted
 into -ENODEV ?
