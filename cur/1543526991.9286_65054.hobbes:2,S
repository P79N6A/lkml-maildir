> [lots of syscall combining proposals snipped]
where's ingo?  shouldn't he be jumping in here telling us syscall overhead
is some impressively tiny number of cycles which is bare noise above the
L1/L2 cache sloshing we'll see at scale?  :)  after all, we're talking
about servers with 4k+ sockets, and alan cox tells us to budget about 23kb
of memory per socket -- that's almost 100Mb of RAM... makes me wonder if
combining syscalls is worth the complexity.
out of curiosity, has the fast syscall and fast gettimeofday stuff with
the nifty kernel-supplied code page made it into the kernel/glibc/etc?
