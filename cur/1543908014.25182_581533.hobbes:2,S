a) chicken and egg: asm-generic/atomic.h depends on definitions in asm/atomic.h
If you can find a way to reshuffle the code and make it simpler, I personally am 
all for it.  I'm skeptical that you'll get much to show for the effort.
b) The definitions aren't precisely identical between all architectures, so it 
would be a mess of special cases, which gets us right back to where we are now.
