This, along with some other debugging stuffs I've used for chasing some
bugs in some of my recent powermac kernel work, lead me to a question. I
appologize in advance if this has already been discussed here of course ;)
Shouldn't we have some kind of global (or per-subsystem) DEBUG flag in
the kernel, which would add a reasonable quantity of macro-based argument
checking and state checking in various kernel functions ? This would
allow developers working on a specific part of the kernel to run "debug"
kernels that would help spot problem in the newly developed code (or in
exiting code).
