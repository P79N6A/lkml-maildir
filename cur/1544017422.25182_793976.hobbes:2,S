Alright, there are other places where renaming would be nice -
kernelstack, oldrsp, irqcount, irqstackptr and isidle.  I'll rename
them as I add the patches.  Here's the plan.
	01-04	: w/ renames
	05	: will mark voyage broken
	06-12	: w/ renames
	13-17	: will wait for update
If anyone doesn't like it.  Please scream.
Thanks.
