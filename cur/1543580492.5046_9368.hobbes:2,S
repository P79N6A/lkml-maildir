Upgrade modutils, pppd, and other things to fix all the "problems" with
this kernel.  I found this one out, becuase the guys here politely pointed
that out to me that the "Documentation/Changes" file tells this stuff for
every kernel release.
The module directory was redesigned, as well as other internals to the
Kernel, and that's why newer utilities are required.
