Well originally the only serial input devices where joysticks. As time
goes on this is not true any longer. We have several non joystick serio
based devices in CVS. Plus we use the serio setup for non serial but PIO 
type input devices. PS/2 is a good example of such hardware. So yes I
agree serio.c and serport.c should be moved into drivers/input. I had this
problem when developing the h3600 touchscreen driver for the iPAQ using
the input api.

Actually I like to see all input devices in drivers/input but last time I
suggested that it was shot down. In time they will be moved there. Either
that or drivers/char will be 95% input drivers.
