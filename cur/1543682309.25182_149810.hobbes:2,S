This patch went into 2.4.21, and we immediately got a bug report! 
See 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.1/1871.html
I wrote another patch (better, I hope), which is now in 2.4.22-pre6-ac1.
It is included below.  I would appreciate it if it got some testing on
both Toshiba laptops and other machines.
I am also interested in helping fix it in 2.6, but let's see if the fix
for 2.4 works first.
Chris
