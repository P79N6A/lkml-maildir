Subject: [MOUSE] "Virtual PC" mouse no longer works

Dear mailing list,
I'm running Debian inside Connectix Virtual PC 6.0.1. This software 
simulates Pentium-based hardware on a Macintosh. It lets the guest OS 
"captue" the Macintosh mouse - when the guest OS wants to use the mouse, 
the Macintosh pointer disappears and the guest OS receives mouse events. 
This is done using a virtual PS/2 device.
This functionality works with the following kernels (with relevant 
configuration options). They are stock Debian kernels.
2.2.20:
    CONFIG_MOUSE=y
    CONFIG_PSMOUSE=y
2.4.18:
    CONFIG_PSMOUSE=y
The mouse is free until X starts up (getting mouse events from 
/dev/psaux) and is then "captured" and usable in X. But with 
2.6.0-test11, this functionality is broken. The relevant parameters in 
my .config are:
    CONFIG_INPUT=y
    CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
    CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX=y
    CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
    CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
    CONFIG_BUSMOUSE=y
I have tried:
  1) Using /dev/input/mice and /dev/psaux in my XF86Config
  2) Passing psmouse_noext=1 to the kernel
Neither gave any success.
Please cc: me on any replies as I am not subscribed. Thank you for your 
time.
Sincerely,
