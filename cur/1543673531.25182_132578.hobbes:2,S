Subject: [PATCH 2.5] IrDA patches changelog (for 2.5.70)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi Jeff,
	This is the next batch of IrDA patches that has been patiently
waiting on my web page. The first patch is all over the place, so you
may want to apply before too much spelling fixes happen in the kernel.
	The first patch is the result of joint work between Jan Kiszka
and me. Jan has ported the Linux-IrDA stack to Win2k, and his
implementation doesn't tolerate any skb leaks. So, we were forced to
fix all skb leaks in Linux-IrDA. Patch intensively tested.
	I also spent some quality time with the irport driver and made
it functional again. A crasher in irnet, the new smsc-ircc2 driver and
many little fixes. All tested in 2.5.69-bk7 SMP.
	Would you mind pushing those patches to Linus ?
	Regards,
	Jean
P.S.: For Andrew that like to keep todo lists for 2.5.X :
	o all known functional bugs in the core Linux-IrDA stacks are fixed.
	o some IrDA driver work has to take place :
		- dongle drivers need to be converted to sir-dev
		- irport need to be converted to sir-kthread
		- new drivers (irtty-sir/smsc-ircc2/donauboe) need more testing
	o The list of cleanups and wishes is long, and many people complain
	  that the source s***s, but those don't prevent usage of Linux-IrDA
