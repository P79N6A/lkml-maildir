Dangerous, as it may overwrite local changes you have! A simple "git
checkout include/asm-blackfin/macros.h" is much safer in this case.
In git commit df30b11 this file got redundant. Perhaps because a normal
patch was applied, instead of with git, the file didn't get deleted from
the repository but truncated to size zero. Not strictly wrong perse, but
for the Linux repository highly unusual (and the only one at that).
Your toolchain perhaps deletes files with zero size after cleaning up or
something. Git then notices that you deleted this file.
Perhaps someone can apply something like the following to finally fix
this up:

    Blackfin arch: remove zero-sized include/asm-blackfin/macros.h
    This file accidentally got truncated instead of deleted in commit df30b11.
