A larger boost to keep-the-page-in-memory priority for pages referenced
by "interactive" processes might be in order.  Either faster vmscanning
simply a higher priority for pages found to be used.  Might not be too
hard to implement either.
A larger priority for page-in I/O due to interactive process too might
help too.  Some modification of Andrea's elevator.  But that doesn't
seem so easy.
