Hello Benoit,

Found this :
# This file assigns persistent names to network interfaces.
# See iftab(5) for syntax.
eth0 mac 00:11:d8:a9:c0:c2 arp 1
ra0 mac 00:11:d8:b9:27:7e arp 1
As these are no MAC on my machine, I suspect this is the reason for the
renaming.
I'm trying Olaf's patch to check the message is printed, and next boot
is without this crap in this /etc/iftab file.
Regards,
Paul
