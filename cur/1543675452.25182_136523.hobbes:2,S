Mark, it would be nice to get a graph of the combined results for each
test.  Something like:
                 tiobench sequential write rate
  |                                  +++++++++++++++++      + = -mm-ext3
M |        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++*****************      * = linus-ext3
B | +++++++*****************   ######                       # = -ac-ext3
/ |                                                         . = -mm-XFS
s |                                                         = = -ac-XFS
  |                         *********                       etc

			date
This allows at-a-glance trends for each group of tests and (as in the
example above you could see easily when a performance bug was added
and fixed in -ac before in the linus kernel, for example).  Probably
having all of the comparable results on the same page, or even in the
same graph results is a win.
Bonus points if you can click on a spot in the graph and get the results
page for that date/test ;-).
Cheers, Andreas
