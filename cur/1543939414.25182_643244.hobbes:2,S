Then we'd also have to fix dcache.h:
#define DCACHE_NFSFS_RENAMED  0x0002    /* this dentry has been "silly 
                                         * renamed" and has to be 
                                         * deleted on the last dput() 
                                         */ 
by adding \ at the end of the comments, to unbreak cooledit and mc.
(The problem is not the comment, but the seemingly stray " in the 2nd line)
