I'm running 30+ usenet servers, currently on older RH versions. Better 
performance would certainly be a plus, although stability WRT lockups 
has been an issue, as has operation when the number of threads gets very 
high. First tests of RHEL looked very promising for stability, I'm 
hoping to get the okay to do serious production testing next week.
