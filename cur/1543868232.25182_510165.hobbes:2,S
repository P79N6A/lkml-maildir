In my case of relatively old ALi chipset CD-ROM was never detected if DMA is
allowed. Unfortunately this remained mystery for quite some time. Legacy
IDE drivers are working just fine; it is only pata_ali that failes :(
See e.g. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116500554505311&w=2
(2.6.19: ALi M5229 - CD-ROM not found with pata_ali)
if you have any idea how to debug it ...
