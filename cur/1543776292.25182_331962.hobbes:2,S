What is needed is to flesh out what the kernel interface should looke
like. I suggested a sysfs file for suspending and resuming access to the

It's a test utility, I just wrote it so people could test. The actual
command used woule be used in the internal implementation. The file
itself holds no other value than for testing purposes.
