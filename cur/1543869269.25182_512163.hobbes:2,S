Solaris (NTL - very large ISP/Telco), Dec server 5000 (for fun), Irix (and
linux cross for Irix removal), MIPS embedded (including the port to Linux
of Algorithmics toolchain) for Sonix then 3COM routers.
It's not a hard problem. gcc 2.x wasn't too hot on MIPS but it worked
although the Irix compiler generated vastly better code (and AFAIK still
does).
There are folks who maintain cross devel chains for just about every
Linux platform specifically for testing and while it isn't a small job
they do seem to be coping quite happily.

Lots of people would disagree with you about that (and independant
surveys would back the disagreement), like they would disagree with you
about most things.

I was hoping you'd take the pseudo-legal noise elsewhere.
