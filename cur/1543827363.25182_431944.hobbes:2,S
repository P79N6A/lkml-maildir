[4597362.011000] ata3: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 
0xb/00/00
[4597362.011000] ata3: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
[4597362.011000] ata3: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Now under 2.6.16.20. (was doing an rsync from 1 drive (IDE) -> to this 
SATA) drive.
The SATA drive AFAIK does not have any issues, no bad sectors/etc, still 
the same drive as before, but this is the new one from the previous RMA.
Just FYI.
