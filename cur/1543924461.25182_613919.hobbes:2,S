What *I* need. For eth1394.

I see nothing preventing chained sg lists to be feed into
sbp2scsi_queuecommand() which then gives these lists to
sbp2_prep_command_orb_sg().
And there I find this:
static void sbp2_prep_command_orb_sg(struct sbp2_command_orb *orb,
                                     struct sbp2_fwhost_info *hi,
                                     struct sbp2_command_info *cmd,
                                     unsigned int scsi_use_sg,
                                     struct scatterlist *sgpnt,
                                     u32 orb_direction,
                                     enum dma_data_direction dma_dir)
{
[snip]
for (i = 0, sg_count = 0 ; i < count; i++, sgpnt++) {
As yesterday my md1_raid5-thread oopsed with the same bug from the
thread "kernel NULL pointer dereference in blk_rq_map_sg with
v2.6.23-6815-g0895e91" I'm rather suspicious of anything sg related
right now. (At least I think its the same bug, as 2.6.23-mm1 does not
contain the fix from that thread)

With that patch, 2.6.24-rc1-b4f555081fdd27d13e6ff39d455d5aefae9d2c0c
boots, eth1394 works.
