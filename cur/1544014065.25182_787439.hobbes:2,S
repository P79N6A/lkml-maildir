Hi Sam,
	VIOPATH is used only by the PPC_ISERIES code. The symbols selecting
the VIOPATH are also dependent on the PPC_ISERIES. Should we make the 
config VIOPATH as default n, because it being selected the dependent
drivers.
Impact: Fix the VIOPATH dependency in the iSeries dependent drivers.
iSeries depend drivers build fails, when CONFIG_VIOPATH is disabled.
Removing the dependency of VIOPATH by selecting it, when the drivers
dependent on iSeries code.
