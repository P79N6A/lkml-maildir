This problem is unrelated, I guess. You have to take special care if
you want to run both X and gpm at the same time anyway, but it should
be documented in the gpm manpage.

I've experienced similar problems with shared PCI IRQs.  Try to
manually assign an IRQ to the PCI slot in which the video card (do you
mean graphics card?) is placed.  Usually, you can do this using the
setup program of your BIOS.
