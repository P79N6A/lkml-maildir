and when do you expect these changes to be integrated?  we've had this 
implementation for almost a year, and zach brown has reviewed it.  we 
discussed the aio_read/readv change with him and he agreed that this 
should go in now.
we have major customers who are demanding this functionality now, and 
can support the reimplementation whenever you guys get your aio act 
together.
