No, it's not because it's not my policy, but because the kernel tries
to avoid handling "policy". :)
It is common to talk about software that implements "policy" or
"mechanism". "mechanism" is simple the act of performing a given, well
defined task (e.g. turn on LED A). "policy" on the other hand is
selecting an action when there are multiple, equally valid actions.
Usually this involves the user, directly or indirectly.
The kernel tries to stay clear of "policy" as it is a complex problem
that is better solved per system, in user space. So what I meant when I
said that this is policy, I was saying that this is a "policy" kind of
decision that needs to be configurable from user space.

Different in what regard? Or are you referring to the already present
clock fudging in the driver?

This is a project that has been popping up now and then, but the big
thing that is lacking is someone who is able to actually measure if
there is a power gain from this. I don't want to add a lot of code that
isn't doing any good, so I want hard numbers.
