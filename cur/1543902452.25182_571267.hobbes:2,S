Are you sure about that chunk size? In you initial posting you show
/proc/mdstat reporting:
"md2 : active raid5 sdc3[2] sda3[0] sdb3[1]
      780083968 blocks level 5, 128k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]"
Which would seem to state a 128K chunk, and thus with a 4k block size
you would need a stride of 32.
