Nice theory, but of course I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't work
(as has been said numerous time before by other people).
You cannot do endless testing/bugfixing, it's a psychological issue.
If you do that, then you end up with -preXX (or worse, -preXXX)
version numbers, which would cause too many people to wait and wait
and wait with upgrading until "that next stable" kernel version
finally becomes available.
IOW, your tester base erodes, awfully, and development progress stalls.
You *have* to release a new ""stable"" version rather fast (the .0 one)
so that people will have that "new shiny version, get it while it's hot!"
feeling and will realize rather quickly that that new version
is all crap again after all and report their unhappiness.
That will lead to lots of -stable bug fixes which will then result in
a very stable actual version once you reach x.y.z.15 or so.
Capito? :)
(well, that's at least how I'm seeing it; correct me if I'm wrong)
