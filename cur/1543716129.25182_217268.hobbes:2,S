Both are to be believed. They merely describe different things.
Pagein/pageout are counts of VM-initiated IO, regardless of whether this
IO is done on filesystem-backed pages or swap-backed pages. Pagein and
pageout are used more generally to describe VM-initiated IO and don't
exclusively refer to swap IO, but also include IO to filesystems to/from
filesystem-backed memory.
Swapin/swapout are counts of swap IO only, and are considered to apply
only to IO done to swap files/devices to/from swap-backed anonymous memory.
Pagein/pageout are both proper and necessary to have. In fact, you were
requesting that filesystem IO be done preferentially to swap IO, and the
pagein/pageout indicators showing IO while swapin/swapout indicators show
none mean you are getting exactly what you asked for.
