My distro is a Debian testing/sid.
hotplug is 0.0.20040329-25
udev is 0.70-2
This occurs after init started.
From what I see, it's during hotplug, when it scans isapnp devices.
hotplug finds PNP0800 in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:07/id and then
loads pcspkr. The oops occurs during "modprobe -s -q -q pcspkr"
in the isapnp.rc script.
This script is attached in case there's something specific in Debian.
I don't see how I could investigate further.
Let me know if you have any idea to debug the modprobe.
Regards,
Brice
