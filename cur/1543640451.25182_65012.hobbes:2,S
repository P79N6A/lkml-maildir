It is also important to note that most benchmarks go out of their
way to analyze this situation properly in the massively parallel
supercomputer world, and that for the most part supercomputers excel
in I/O bandwidth more than CPU power, so if you bought your SV2 to
run quake you _deserve_ to only get 100fps :)
To try to bring this a little more back on topic, is there any
particular group in the Linux community who's dissatisfied with
our scalability (except for IBM, who seem to be working on this
issue already.  I mean anyone who's _not_ seeing things done to
rectify the situation :)
