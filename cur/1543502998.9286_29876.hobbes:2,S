I don't understand what's too generic about calling it "bus". I thought that
sort of generality was the purpose.
To me, the problem with calling it "pci" is that it's likely to be taken
literally. People writing for other bus archs will not know or forget that
it's for them too. People writing for pci will add pci specializations to
it.
Its all my opinion, and I'm not campaigning for any particular name. Just
saying that names do matter,
Regards,
Tom
