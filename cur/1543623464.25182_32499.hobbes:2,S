Yes, the problem goes even deeper. A simple hook is not enough.
One must know who is actually holding the lock, so that the cleanup
routines do the right thing.
E.g. store the pid with the lock. As Rusty stated this has still race 
conditions.
Anyway, this should be orthogonal to the low level services
provided. 
Another issue is that of rwlocks. Here its perfectly OK to die if
you hold the lock in read mode and clean up before going away.
Again, this should not be part of the base service.
