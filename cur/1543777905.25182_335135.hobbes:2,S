Subject: Automating Kernel Builds

I have a script that automatically builds kernels for testing. Would it
be possible to put the kernel version number (2.6.12.3) into the
'LATEST-IS-VERSION' file on 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
or, is there some other file that traditionally has stored this info? I
searched the repository but could not find one.
As of now, my script goes to the site and parses the page searching for
a line that contains 'LATEST-IS' and then breaks that line apart and
attempts to extract the kernel version number from it. If
LATEST-IS-VERSION actually contained the version number (2.6.12.3)
instead of being a 0 byte file as it is now, then it my script could
simply read it and not have to do funky html parsing to get the latest
version number ;)
Thank you all.
