Hrm... In your previous mail, you talked about doing a thin layer
that gives efficiency. That's exactly what it is.
Honestly, you can find crappy code in linux here or there, that's
not the problem. I doubt you'll be able to backup your claims very
long regarding this specific one which is SMP, especially in 2.5
kernels.
But feel free to prove me wrong by actually doing something, then
showing us numbers !
