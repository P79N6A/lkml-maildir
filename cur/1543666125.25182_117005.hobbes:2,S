I've been working through a set of DMA problems. The PIO/DMA switching
timing out is fixed and has been for a while. I've very recently fixed a
race where we could get a command issued while resetting an interface.
With 2.4.x the reports I have make me think there are more races in
ide-scsi left. With 2.5.x its completely broken. Someone rewrote the
abort/reset handling, some other people rewrote the scsi core and the
result needs significant work yet
