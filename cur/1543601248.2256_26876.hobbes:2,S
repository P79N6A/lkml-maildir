Well, I guess this is everybody's first idea about the problem: make an initial
timestamp for knowing how _old_ an allocation really is, and make an access
counter. Ok. The first is easy, but how do you achieve an access-counter? If
this was solved, the problem is solved.
You can do really nice aging with access to such kind of information.
Any ideas?
