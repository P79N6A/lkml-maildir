Users,
      This problem is being a real pain in the neck
for me and I can't figure out any way to get around
it. I am trying to load an e1000 driver as a module
but I am getting unresolved symbols. The hash values
at the end of the exported symbols do not match the
corresponding hash values in the /proc/ksyms file in
the running kernel. I gather that this is because
module versioning is turned on in the kernel. I can't
compile the driver against the kernel as I don't have
the correct kernel sources. Is there any possible way
to get the network driver to load into this kernel
image without the kernel sources. I imagine the hash
values from /proc/ksyms and the driver unresolved
symbols will have to match but how can this be done. I
would really appreciate some help with this.
Thanks,
        Cathal
