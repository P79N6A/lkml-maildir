sed s/Mr. Libenzi/Davide/g ... I'm not that old :)
There're a couple of reason's why the drop of the initial event is a waste
of time :
1) The I/O write space is completely available at fd creation
2) For sockets it's very likely that the first packet brought something
	more than the SYN == The I/O read space might have something for you
I strongly believe that the concept "use the fd until EAGAIN" should be
applied even at creation time, w/out making exceptions to what is the
API's rule to follow.
