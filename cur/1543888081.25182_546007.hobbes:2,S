With the memory controller, I suspect memory reclaim will become a function
of the memory the container tries to touch that lies outside its limit.
If a container requires 512 MB of memory and we configure the container
size as 256 MB, then we might see aggressive memory reclaim. We do provide
some statistics to help the user figure out if the reclaim is aggressive,
we'll try and add more statistics.

It's built on top of the containers infrastructure. Version 2 was posted
on top of containers v8.

The RSS controller was posted by Pavel based on some initial patches by me,
so we are in agreement w.r.t approach to memory control. Vaidy is working
on a page cache controller, we are able to use the existing RSS infrastructure
for writing the page cache controller (unmapped). All the stake holders are
on cc, I would request them to speak out on the issues and help build a way
to take this forward.
I've been reviewing and testing Paul's containers v9 patches. As and when
I find more issues, I plan to send out fixes. It'll be good to have the
containers infrastructure in -mm, so that we can start posting controllers
against them for review and acceptance.
