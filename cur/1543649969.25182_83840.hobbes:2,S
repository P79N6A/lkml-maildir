If the "embedded system" just brews his coffee, then there are not
many security issues he cares about. It gets the job done. 
Amol, Just add a "mem=4M" to the kernel commandline and see what 
happens. It depends a lot on what and how many applications you run
on that system. 
But still, Alan is right. You might run into odd problems that are
simply fixed if you upgrade. (My workstation was "pretty good" at 
staying up under 2.4.2 (about a month at a time), and I didn't want 
to upgrade, for fear of it getting worse. I upgraded and now get
much better uptimes (until my colleague types "reboot -n -f" into 
the wrong window)).
