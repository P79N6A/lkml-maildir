Same way WS4.5.1. It should work, but it was not specifically tested,
and I did not add gsx3 emulation layer into vmware-any-any-updates yet.
If you'll use kernel 2.6.x in the guest, you'll have some minor troubles
with building hgfs & vmxnet modules for the guest, but if you have
some exprience with kernel code it is trivial to fix them - two oneliners
in hgfs & two twoliners in vmxnet.
