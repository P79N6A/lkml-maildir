It's tagged broken _because_ it doesn't build yet.  I've patches in the
queue, they depend on some dvb updates through, and I'm bugging the
linuxtv guys at the moment to push updates, so I can submit my stuff as
well.  The build failure and the CONFIG_BROKEN will go away then.
There is no point in fixing the build now somehow because that wouldn't
make the driver actually work ...
