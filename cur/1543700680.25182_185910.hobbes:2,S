s/the random number generator/the kernel's random number generator
(random.c)/
E.g., my point was that the device file was the user-space
representation of the kernel rng, so associating the kernel rng
attributes with the device file made sense.  I did not mean to imply it
was the be-all and end-all of rng's on the machine.
