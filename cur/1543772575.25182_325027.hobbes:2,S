FWIW I definitely agree that merging PREEMPT_RT design and nanokernel
design in a single RT kernel makes lots of sense, and this confirms my
original belief that preempt-RT and nanokernel are orthogonal and they
don't cover the same domain of RT apps (or they'd overlap completely and
it would be pointless to have them at the same time in the same kernel
to use them at the same time).
