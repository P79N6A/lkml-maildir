I tried to install Linux to one old server. However when booting
immediately after "POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX" it gives
General protection: 0000
and so on. I can post the details, if someone is interested looking in
them.
The kernel is 2.2.5 kernel on redhat 6.0 installation disks. The machine
is Siemens-Nixdorf PCD-5T. Mobo seems to be dual Socket 5 board w/ 3
PCI, 1 ISA and 4 EISA slots. Chipset might be neptune? The machine had
previously been running SCO Unix successfully for several years. There is
PCI AHA-2940-SCSI-controller installed, and there is also a pci graphics
adapter of some sort.
