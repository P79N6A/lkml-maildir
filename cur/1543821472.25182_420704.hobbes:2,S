One way I've seen this done on other systems is to use something like a
prio tree [e.g., see the shared policy support for shmem] for sub-vma
protection ranges.  Most vmas [I'm guessing here] will have only the
original protections or will be reprotected in toto.  So, one need only
allocate/populate the protection tree when sub-vma protections are
requested.   Then, one can test protections via the vma, perhaps with
access/check macros to hide the existence of the protection tree.  Of
course, adding a tree-like structure could introduce locking
complications/overhead in some paths where we'd rather not [just
guessing again].  Might be more overhead than just mucking with the ptes
[for UML], but would keep the ptes in sync with the vma's view of
"protectedness".
