glibc thread local data uses an LDT for the segment register.
glibc 2.3 seems to plan to use segment register based thread local data for 
even non threaded programs, so it would be a good idea to optimize LDT 
allocation a bit (= not allocate 64K of vmalloc space every time 
sys_modify_ldt is called - there is only 8MB of it)
