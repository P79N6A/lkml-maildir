How about doing the above using a debug config option? So that when the
config option is turned on, all per-cpu area references to not possible 
cpus crash? and leave that option default on on -mm :).  That way we can 
quickly catch all references.  We can probably change the arch independent 
setup_per_cpu_areas also to do allocations for cpu_possible cpus only while 
we are at it?
