The following script locks my machine up hard after a few iterations.
VFAT is configured as a module.  I have had similar lockups with MSDOS and
SMBFS.  I have not been able to reproduce such lockups when they were not
modules.
Stick a floppy in the floppy drive and mformat a:
Then run this (I've also done this with an MSDOS HD partition; I don't
recommend that though 'cause if it locks up it'll hose the partition):

#! /bin/sh
mkdir -p /tmp/mnt
mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /tmp/mnt
while true; do
	cp -av /usr/src/linux/arch/ppc /tmp/mnt/ppc
	ls -lR /tmp/mnt
	rm -rf /tmp/mnt/ppc
done
--- 8< ---
I'm curious if others can reproduce this.  Try it with an SMBFS mounted
share, too.
