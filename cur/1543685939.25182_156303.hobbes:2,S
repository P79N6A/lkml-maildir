It may well be when you use it in boolean constructs. The following functions
return exactly the same result with different code :
int test1(int u, int v, int x, int y) {
   return (u > v) || (x > y);
}
int test2(int u, int v, int x, int y) {
   return !!(u > v) | !!(x > y);
}
test1() uses 2 jumps on x86 while test2 uses only test-and-set and should be
faster. This also allows to easily write the boolean XOR BTW :
int test3(int u, int v, int x, int y) {
   return !!(u > v) ^ !!(x > y);
}
Cheers,
Willy
