I think you can get all the PCI Bus-Masters shut off simply
by writing PCI device 0 (The bridge itself) command register
to 0.
This is what I do in my BIOS (Intel dest<--source):

;	The PCI bus may be on from a previous boot or from a failure to
;	reset. This causes a lot of problems that took me weeks to find.
;	Make sure the damn thing is dead, dead, dead before we continue.
;	It is not sufficient to just clear SYSARBMEMB as the documentation
;	shows. PCI devices will "jabber", corrupting data if the host
;	bridge is not turned off.

	MOV	DX,PCICFGADR			; PCI configuration address
	MOV	EAX,80000004H			; Enable, index 1 (command)
	OUT	DX,EAX				; Set index register
	MOV	DX,PCICFGDATA			; Data address
	IN	EAX,DX				; Get status/command
	AND	EAX,0FFFF0000H			; Really turn it OFF
	OUT	DX,EAX				; This should do it.
;
	MOV	WORD PTR DS:[SYSARBMEMB],00H	; Now disable PCI access
	MOV	DX,PCICFGADR			; PCI configuration address
	MOV	EAX,80000000H			; Enable, index 0
	OUT	DX,EAX				; Set index register
	MOV	DX,PCICFGDATA			; Data address
	IN	EAX,DX				; Get, throw away
