   This detects the A2 ST16C255x as an XR16550, so apparently the sleep
check doesn't work.  I contacted Exar about these two seemingly
identical UARTs, and they say that the A2 ST16C255x should be compatible
with the XR16550 so perhaps we don't need to special case the A2 UART at
all.  Unfortunately, when I use the UART for a console, I get garbled
output from the time the UART is detected until we hit userspace.  I
wonder if this has something to do with the early console registration
with a conflicting type...  I'll see if I can figure out what's going
on.  Have you used the XR16550 as a console on your system?  Perhaps
it's as simple as the baud getting reset via the has_efr check.  I'm
trying to use the system with a 115.2k baud rate.  Thanks,
	Alex
