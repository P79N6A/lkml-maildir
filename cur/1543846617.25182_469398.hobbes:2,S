i wrote wrong file name:
where is linux/platform_device.h file?
as per the patch :
+#include <linux/ide.h>
+#include <linux/platform_device.h>

+/*
+ * Users use per-port registration with a simple set of 3 resources
+ * per port:
+ * 		- I/O Base (IORESOURCE_IO)
+ * 		- CTL Base (IORESOURCE_IO)
+ * 		- IRQ	   (IORESOURCE_IRQ)
+ */
+static int __devinit ide_platform_probe(struct platform_device *dev)
+{
+	struct resource *io_res, *ctl_res;
+	hw_regs_t hw;

+	if (unlikely(dev->num_resources != 3)) {
+		dev_err(&dev->dev, "invalid number of resources\n");
+		return -EINVAL;
