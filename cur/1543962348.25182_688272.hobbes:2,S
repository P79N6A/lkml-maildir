please check the patch in x86.git, it should do the same thing, but
put the call in pci_access_init...

    x86 PCI: call dmi_check_pciprobe()

    |    x86-64: introduce struct pci_sysdata to facilitate sharing of ->sysdata
    |
    |    This patch introduces struct pci_sysdata to x86 and x86-64, and
    |    converts the existing two users (NUMA, Calgary) to use it.
    |
    |    This lays the groundwork for having other users of sysdata, such as
    |    the PCI domains work.
    |
    |    The Calgary bits are tested, the NUMA bits just look ok.
    replaces pcibios_scan_root with pci_scan_bus_parented...
    but in pcibios_scan_root we have a DMI check:
        dmi_check_system(pciprobe_dmi_table);
    when when have several peer root buses this could be called multiple
    times (which is bad), so move that call to pci_access_init().
