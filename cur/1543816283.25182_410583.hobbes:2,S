Subject: why no option for 'ide=nocddma'?

   It appears that the current Linux kernel still has trouble
verifying installation CDs for Fedora Core even in the FC5
release unless users pass the 'ide=nodma' kernel option. If
the problem with CDs using dma isn't going to be fully resolved,
why can't we have a 'ide=nocddma' kernel option that would only
apply to CD/DVD drives? The current situation is unfortunate
because installations end up with 'ide=nodma' in grub.conf
which severely slows down disk i/o. Thanks in advance for
any information on this issue.

ps Does this issue with dma and CD/DVD drives only apply to reads
or are writes effected as well?
