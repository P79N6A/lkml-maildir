I just tried this change to i8042.c, and suspend magically started
working.
@@ -814,8 +815,8 @@
        i8042_port_register(&i8042_kbd_values, &i8042_kbd_port);
  
        init_timer(&i8042_timer);
-       i8042_timer.function = i8042_timer_func;
-       mod_timer(&i8042_timer, jiffies + I8042_POLL_PERIOD);

+//     mod_timer(&i8042_timer, jiffies + I8042_POLL_PERIOD);
  
        register_reboot_notifier(&i8042_notifier);
  
So it looks like i8042 could do with hooking some power management
to disable this timer before suspend and resume it afterwards.
Vojtech?
