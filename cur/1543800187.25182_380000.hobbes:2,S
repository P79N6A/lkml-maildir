Was it a mistake to drop support for ipfwadm and ipchains?
Was it a mistake to drop support for devsfs?
Will it be a mistake to drop support for gcc < 3.2?
Will it be a mistake to remove the obsolete raw driver?
Will it be a mistake to drop the Video4Linux API 1 ioctls?
Will it be a mistake to drop support for pcmcia-cs?
...
And if any of these was or will not be a mistake, when is the right time  
for the userspace breakage?
I did agree with what you express before support for ipchains was 
removed and support for devfs was removed, and many more I do not 
remember currently, but I've now simply accepted that regarding kernel 
development, 6 is an odd number.
The fundamental problem is that the current development model 
contains no well-defined points where breakages of the kernel-related 
userspace were allowed and expected by users.
