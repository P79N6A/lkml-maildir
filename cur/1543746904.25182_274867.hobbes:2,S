Subject: should delete_inode be allowed to be called from shrink_dcache?

Hello
Is there anything wrong that
mkdir dir
cd dir
rmdir ../dir
ls file
cd ..
leaves after itself two dentries - negative one ("file") and dentry of
directory "dir" which is attached to inode of that directory?
After that a process may get into somefs_delete_inode trying to free
pages by shrinking dcache (it will first free negative dentry and then
its parent).
If process is doing that being already in somefs_write (for example)
some filesystems may have problems.
Thanks
