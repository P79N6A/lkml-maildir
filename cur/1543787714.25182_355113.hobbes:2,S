Just a thought -----
Programs like cp -a /bigdir /backup and rsync usually bring the server 
to a crawl no matter how much "nice" you put on them. Is there any way 
to make "nice" smarter in that it limits io as well as processor usage? 
If cp and rsyne ran a little slower IO wise then everything else could 
run too.
