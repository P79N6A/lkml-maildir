Hello,
I experienced a similar situation once. My setup was as follows: 
Linux box running RH 5.2, kernel 2.2.3 (not very sure, it was in March),
Netgear NIC (tulip driver), Baystack 303 Ethernet switches.
An old Prosignia VS server running Netware 3.12 was connected to the same
switch.
Linux box was using IPX, autoconfigured, with all three types of frame.
At some point in time the whole network got poisoned with multicast
packets originating from Netware with undeliverable target MAC address. 
My investigation revealed the following. 
Packets sent from Linux box got distorted, as if delayed on the wire. MAC
address in the header of the packet was shifted two or three bytes.
Netware server received those packets with invalid (non-existent) MAC
address and replied to them. The packets were undeliverable, of course.
What I changed after all, I turned off autoconfigure option of IPX and
left etherII frame only. Poisoning never repeated since then.
