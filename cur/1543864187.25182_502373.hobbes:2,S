ata_piix survives exactly one suspend resume cylce. After resuming the
second time the disk is not longer usable.
After the first resume a simple "emacs -nw bla.txt" takes already ~45sec
to launch, but there are no kernel messages.
During the second resume the ATA interrupt gets disabled due to an
unhandled interrupt.
This is 100% reproducible. So I can provide as much info as needed.
