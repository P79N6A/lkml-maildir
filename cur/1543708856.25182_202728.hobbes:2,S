Dunno if I qualify as sufficiently 'really smart' enough but the
last time I put in the considerable effort needed to re-sync the
2.4 and 2.6 IDE layers, and merge in the useful -ac bits that
never made it into mainstream, nothing whatsoever came of my
efforts...
My 2.4.x patches are in daily use by a large group of people
and they work fine, for what it is worth.  My IDE merging
patches are the following:
    
http://codepoet.org/kernel/
    020_ide_layer_2.4.22-ac4.bz2
    021_ide_geom_hpa_capacity64.bz2
    022-extra-ide-drives.bz2
    023-2.4.25-libata1.patch.bz2
    024_libata-spurious2.diff.bz2
    025-cenatek.patch.bz2
    026-medley-softraid.patch.bz2
The 021_ide_geom_hpa_capacity64.bz2 is my original work, the
others are the result of skimming patches from the list and
merging/updating them as needed to sync with the other patches
and keep them current.
