Subject: SMP sock_select problem (GPF and such)

There is a problem with the select code in 2.0.36 (and probably 2.0.37
as well, but this hasn't been tested) that results in kernel GPF on
SMP machines. There also seems to exist a related problem in 2.2.x, that
results in processes stuck in skb_recv_datagram rather than a GPF. This
problem has been duplicated on numerous machines.
There is a Python script at 
ftp://ftp.pangalactic.org/pub/outgoing/pytest
that will show these problems. This script requires Python-1.5.2/glibc to
run. It just spawns up to 50 threads all doing gethostbyname_r(). It
will do 1000 calls with up to 50 outstanding requests at a time.
On a 2.0.36 SMP box pytest will die with a segmentation fault. A view of
the syslog should show a GPF in sock_select. An oops log is attached.
Under 2.2.x SMP the script will never finish. A 'ps awl | grep python'
will show a number of processes stuck in skb_recv_datagram. My best
guess as to what happens is that the gethostbyaddr_r() sends a request
and then waits in select() for a response. Something is triggering
select() improperly and gethostbyaddr_r() then calls recv() when,
in fact, there isn't any data and quite probably the initial request
was actually lost. And since it's UDP, there is no guarantee of
delivery and therefore no guarantee of a response. I've verified
some of this with gdb.
I've looked at the select code, but don't quite get it yet. I need
someone with more experience in the fs and net code to have a look.
