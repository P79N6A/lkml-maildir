Partial support.
The 3c556 is a 'mini PCI' NIC which is starting to appear as a built-in
adaptor on, at least:
	Panasonic CF-L1S 
	HP OmniBook 6000 
	Gateway Solo 9300XL and 2150 
	Compaq Armada E700 
Support is partial because the 3c59x.c in kernel 2.2 does not support power
management.  A moderate amount of mangling will be needed to make it do so.
The workaround is to add something like the following to your power
management `resume' script:
	ifdown eth0
	rmmod 3c59x
	modprobe 3c59x
	ifup eth0
The 3c556 is also supported by Donald Becker's driver
(
http://www.scyld.com
).  Although that driver does support power management,
it does not yet do so for the 3c556.
Another variant of this device has been reported.  It has a PCI device ID of
0x6056.  It has not yet responded to resuscitation attempts.
