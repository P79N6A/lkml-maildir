Ugh ? If I understand things properly, you are copying all of highmem
down to lowmem ? Hrm... I'm afraid in lots of case you'll run out
of lowmem in the process. Actually, we should be able to use highmem
even for snapshotting since the disk IO can then be directly be done
from highmem pages...
(Though kmapp'ing/unmapping each page will be slow as hell)
