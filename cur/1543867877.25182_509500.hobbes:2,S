That sounds as if you have not hit the "interesting" cases yet.  Fun
starts when your device is near-full and you have a write-intensive
workload.  In your case, that would be metadata-write-intensive.  For
one, this is where write performance of log-structured filesystems
usually goes down the drain.  And worse, it is where the cleaner can
run into a deadlock.
Being good where log-structured filesystems usually are horrible is a
challenge.  And I'm sure many people are more interested in those
performance number than in the ones you shine at. :)
