That's not the only attack, actually.  The much simpler attack pathis
for an attack to **observe** the network traffic to such a precise
extent as to be able to guess what the entropy numbers are that are
going into the pool.  (Think: FBI's Carnivore).
The one saving grace here is that in order to really do this well, the
attacker would need to be sitting on the local area network to get the
best and most precise timing numbers.  You can argue that this is
still a theoretical attack; but it's not quite so difficult as saying
that the attacker has to "control" the network traffic.
