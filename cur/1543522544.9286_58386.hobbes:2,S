NO, I'm not accepting ORBS as control instance or ruler over mail. This,
I'm not even reading the FAQ. The correct policy is "spam/relay and be
listed", not "if you block us we will corrupt your mail". No-one forces
me to co-operate.

Do you think I would tell them why I block them? I'd just blacklist them
myself to get rid of them, without further ado.

The entire setup is wrong, and is supported by brain-dead
administrators.

No. The policy is not needed. It is needed that you can track down
spammers and make them pay, and you can track open relay and have them
pay as well, since they helped the spammer.
