Ugh.
Guess you'll have some problems then with UML on x86-64, which always uses
vgettimeofday. But it's only used for gettimeofday() currently, perhaps it's 
not that bad when the UML child runs with the host's time.
I guess it would be possible to add some support for UML
to map own code over the vsyscall reserved locations. UML would need
to use the syscalls then. But it'll be likely ugly.
