OK, will try to reproduce that.

I don't see having to predeclare the thing as non-linear as a serious 
imposition .... I don't think memlocking them is necessary, AFAICS if
we have that.

They're not going away soon (unfortunately) - even if Intel stopped producing
the chips today, the machines based on them are still in the marketplace for
years.
The performance improvement was about 25% of systime according to my 
measurements - I don't call that insignificant.

If there was an existing implementation we could actually measure, I'd
be more impressed. From what I can see currently, it'll just introduce
masses of kmap thrashing crap with no obvious way to fix it. And it 
triples the PTE overhead. Maybe it'd work better in conjunction with 
shared pagetables.
