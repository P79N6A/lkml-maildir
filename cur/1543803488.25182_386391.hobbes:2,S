I wonder if this change could be suspected of affecting stability. With
this unset, data will be sent from the card to low memory, then bounced
to high mem when needed. Maybe the card, northbridge or anything else
sometimes corrupts memory during direct highmem I/O from PCI ? :-/
Or perhaps it's simply too early to conclude anything.
Thanks for your report anyway.

Willy
