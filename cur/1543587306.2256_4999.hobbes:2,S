Subject: [BUG] serial ioctl not returning with 2.4.3

When I try to start "agetty" on my serial line, agetty hangs in an
ioctl; according to strace, this ioctl is "SNDCTL_TMR_STOP".  This
doesn't sound right, but that ioctl is defined as _IO('T', 3) if that
makes any more sense.
The reason that this must be a kernel bug is because agetty works
flawlessly in an identically-configured 2.4.2 kernel, and even a 2.4.3
kernel with the debugging tokens defined.  I'd be glad to give any help
that I could.
