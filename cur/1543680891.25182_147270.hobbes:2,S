Hi Linus.
As you may know, there has been a lot of work done on the 2.4 version of
software suspend. This includes:
- async i/o
- back out on errors rather than panicing (where possible)
- enhancements to refrigerator so it successfully freezes processes even
under high load
- save a full image rather than freeing just about all the memory first
- highmem support
- image compression support
- swapfile support in progress
- nice display
- user can abort at any time during suspend (oh, I forgot, I wanted
to...) by just pressing Escape
- extensive debugging info that doesn't need to be compiled in and can
be adjusted during the suspend cycle (very handy for diagnosing issues)
I'm wanting to get your thoughts on how we should go about merging it. I
don't think these qualify as bug fixes, but current users (and I'm not
excluding myself!) would certainly like to see the patch merged sooner
rather than later. Would it be a good idea to seek to get Marcello and
Andrew to take it into 2.4 and 2.6, and then aim for 2.[7|9]?
Regards,
Nigel
