hi
I have a disk connected to one of the below controllers in ATA mode, 
but I can't enable DMA on it. Intel ATA support is in kernel, but when 
hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc I get the following (extracted from strace)
write(4, " HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation "..., 46 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: 
Operation not permitted
lspci -vvvvvv gave this
