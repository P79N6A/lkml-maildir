please unify the files first, we dont want to let pageattr_32.c and 
pageattr_64.c diverge even more. Once we get these files unified we 
layer more features ontop of it. While gbpages is not available on 
32-bit and probably wont ever be, this code has been historically very 
fragile, so having a single codebase to look at is very important.
