Hi Andrew,
I see LTP DIO test failures on 2.6.10-rc1-mm2 while doing
direct-IO write to filesystem files.
This is due to the changes in generic_file_direct_IO(). I haven't
looked at what exactly happening here (whats faling with page shoot 
down). But we end up getting -EIO.
  /*
- * Called under i_sem for writes to S_ISREG files
+ * Called under i_sem for writes to S_ISREG files.   Returns -EIO if 
something
+ * went wrong during pagecache shootdown.
