Possibly yes, but as long as we don't dereference the pointer (and in a 
prototype you're not going to do that) there's no problem.
Using a type makes the code clearer, and it doesn't hide any warning GCC may 
give (behaving well is left to us only).
In fact, btw (before I forget) we have currently the wrong errno used in 
sys-i386/ldt.c. Just wrote the fix (it's adding a silly os_ptrace_ldt). Going 
to compile and send.
