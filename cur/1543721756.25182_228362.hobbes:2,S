What can I say :-| NB to myself: Kalin, _DO_ read Subject, To, CC for all post in LKML
Sorry.
So, I was poking around for the last hour or so and found quite a few things.
It seems that most people prefer to build iptables against linux-headers supplied by their distribution and not the running kernel. I agreed on that. Although a few distributions may lag behind updating linux-headers, it should be the preferred way as it is stable.
I just downloaded and compiled iptables-1.2.10 against my  system headers using `make KERNEL_DIR=/usr` (haven't actually run it, but it should work).
Well of course if you want the latest-and-greatest extensions, you might try to compile against your running kernel, but you are on your own (with help from netfilter.org).
Kalin.
