   You probably need to verify that 32-bit support is available (both on
   the bridge and the peripherals), but if they are, there's no reason
   not to use it on non-x86 architectures...
Don't the PCI specs actually talk about 24-bits in fact?
Russell does you box really have the full 32-bits or is it
really just 24-bits?
