This is not just limited to Linux.  Windows 98 will also lock up on occasion with the same chipset.  (As well as for any other reason it can come up with.)
I am about ready to give up on VIA chipsets entirely.  They have eaten up FAR too much of my time.  (I have a Pentium II 400mhz with an Intel BX chipset and have had *no* trouble with it.  And kernel compiles are almost so fast it appears broken!)
