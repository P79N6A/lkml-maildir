Sure; in the case of the checkpoint/restart, when you restart an application, what you want is to recreate all system ressources with the same properties they had, when you have checkpointed it.
For IPCs, this means that you need to recreate all the IPCs with the same IDs (at least).
For now, this ID is computed by the system when an IPC is created and you can't specify or modify it.
These patches give you the possibility of changing this ID once the IPC is created.
