Yes, we're printing the ioaddr.* directly and those are all iomapped
addressed now.  I wonder whether we should fix this or push the port
printing to LLDs (with sff helpers in libata-sff).  ahci and
pata_generic sharing one format doesn't sound like a too good idea.
I'll fix it after new init model.
