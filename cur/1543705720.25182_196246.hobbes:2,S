Disagree.  Unless you also want to make it illegal to establish a hard
link if the +s option is set.
A easier set of semantics is that when the inode count drops to zero,
the inode is securely deleted, but that if there are hard links, there
are hard links.  Basically the flag applies to inodes, and that in
some cases, where you create a file in a parent directory, the inode
may inherit the secure deletion flag.  But a creating a hard link
doesn't count as creating a new inode.
