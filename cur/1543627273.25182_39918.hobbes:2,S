There was a previous attempt (now defunct, I believe) to implement a phase 
tree approach for ext2.  While this is definitely not the same as the McKusik 
soft update approach, the end goal of ensuring that the filesystem is 
consistent at all times during operation is, so you may be able to salvage 
something to help you from it.
The person originally doing it was Daniel Phillips
http://people.nl.linux.org/~phillips/
and he called the filesystem tux2.  There were also several papers he 
presented, one to ALS 2000 which unfortunately has no surviving on-line copy.  
Marc Merlin I believe has a copy of the presentation made to the Australian 
Linux Conference in 2001:

And there are probably others dotted about the web if you look.
