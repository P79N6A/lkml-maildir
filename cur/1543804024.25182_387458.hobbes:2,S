Subject: [patch] turn on might_sleep() in early bootup code too
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Could we try the patch below in -mm, to get a feeling of how widespread 
the early bootup lock-atomicity assumptions are? I also added a .config 
option to add back the workaround, and turned it on for ppc64. (users 
can still select this manually on any other arch as well)
i found one such bug on x86: early-printk calls register_console(), 
which acquires console_sem. Since we can work such things around 
per-lock and per-assumption [see the printk.c changes], i think we 
should rather do the workarounds that way, and thus document the hacks 
we need - without impacting the ability of such platforms to boot - 
while still keeping might_sleep() checks widely enabled. (btw., x86 
still booted fine, despite the warning.)

enable might_sleep() checks even in early bootup code (when system_state 
!= SYSTEM_RUNNING). There's also a new config option to turn this off:
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP_EARLY_BOOTUP_WORKAROUND
while most other architectures.
the patch also documents and works around an EARLY_PRINTK locking 
dependency. [which we might want to get rid of in the future.]
tested on x86.
