Only on x86 platforms.  Sparc, IA64, MIPS, powerpc, etc. all get this
case right.
Yes it's another unfortunate side effect of how error status is
indicated for x86 system calls.
I would suggest, that we put something in place to fix this
in the long term:
1) Start setting the condition codes properly to indicate
   error in the system call return path on x86 like other
   platforms do now.  Make sure that it tips off on
   force_successful_syscall_return(), as needed.
2) Come up with a transition plan for glibc et al. to take
   advantage of this.
It actually sounds like the kind of problem that could be
solved well using the VDSO page. :-)
