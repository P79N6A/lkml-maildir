Btw., if this turns out to be a genuine linker bug due to us crossing 
RIP-relative references from minus-1.9G-ish negative addresses up to 
slightly-above-zero positive addresses (or something similar - we are 
pushing the linker here quite a bit), we still have a contingency plan:
We can relocate the percpu symbols to small-negative addresses, and place 
it so that the end of the dynamic percpu area ends at zero.
Then we could bootmem alloc the percpu size plus 4096 bytes. Voila: we've 
got a page free for the canary field, at the end of the percpu area, and 
placed just correctly for gcc to see it at %gs:40.
But this isnt as totally clean and simple as your current patchset, so 
lets only do it if needed. It will also put some constraints on how we can 
shape dynamic percpu areas, and an overflow near the end of the dynamic 
percpu area could affect the canary - but still, it's a workable path as 
well, should the zero-based approach fail.
OTOH, this crash does not have the feeling of a linker bug to me - it has 
the feeling of a setup ordering anomaly.
