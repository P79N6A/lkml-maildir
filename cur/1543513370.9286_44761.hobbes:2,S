Suppose I have 
	disk.img
with at two partitions. 
Then I do
	losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop0 disk.img
	losetup -o 41126400 /dev/loop1 disk.img 
and then mount loop0 and loop1. 
It is very hard for the kernel to see that these are really different
parts of the same file, while if I had used the same offset in the
second case it would've been the same.
In short, you can mess up your system if you do stupid things being
logged in as "root". 
Always has been. Always will be. 
(From how you say things, I understand that you let "mount" do the
losetup for you. Fine. Behind the scenes, mount calls losetup just
like I did by hand here.... )
