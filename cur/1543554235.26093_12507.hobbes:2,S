Generally with ABIs you don't want to mess with it (otherwise you can't be
guaranteed that a library built by somebody else will be compatible with your
code, without all sorts of bits in the e_flags field).  It allows multiple
compilers to be provided that all interoperate (as long as they follow the same
spec).
Don't get me wrong -- in my 25 years of compiler hacking, I've never seen an
ABI that I was completely happy with, including ABI's that I designed myself.
ABIs by their nature are a compromise.  That particular ABI was short sighted
in that it wants only 32-bit alignment for doubles, instead of 64-bit alignment
for instance, and also doesn't align the stack to higher alignment boundaries.
