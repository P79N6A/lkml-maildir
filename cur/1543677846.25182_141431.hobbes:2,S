The distinction in Linux is between anonymous and file-backed mappings.
Executables are file mappings so the pages can just be dropped and they
will be read in from the backing file when needed again. This also holds
true for memory mapped files.
When a mapping has no file (anonymous) then the swap is used. This is
one of the reasons I like mmap() it means you dont end up using swap for
storing buffers containing bits of files which are on disk anyway.
