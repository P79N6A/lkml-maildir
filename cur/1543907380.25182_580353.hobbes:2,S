Yes, I'm talking about memory-mapping PCI memory regions; however I
can't see other immediate uses. Then maybe it's acceptable to document
that - for now - we need to hand out mappings which have consistent
PAT indexes, which would be natural in all cases I've seen with
processes writing/bursting to registers in PCI memory space.

Ignoring the N/A PPro and PII table, the various combinations of MTRR
and PAT entries (table 10-7) again show expected safe behaviour. We
don't worry about WP MTRRs, since BIOSes and Linux don't set that, and
we are practically only interested in WC and UC access, which we get
irrespective of the MTRR type covering that region.
A number of vendors (graphics, HPC etc) implement and use their own
PAT mechanisms, so defining only WC and UC covers all the cases.

A driver that hands out mappings to the same PCI memory address with
different access ordering seems broken by design (due to PCI BARs
being strictly prefetchable or not). Again vendors implement their own
PAT mechanics which are consistent about access types.
(Intel IA32 ASDM 3A 10-47) "a WC page must never be aliased to a
cacheable page because WC writes may not check the processor caches."
This is not talking about corrupting the cache generally, but data
hitting a PCI target twice by (ie) a broken driver.

Providing only UC and WC types and documenting aliasing problems is
what is required here.
