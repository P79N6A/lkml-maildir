Hi,
I've just discovered that I'm (consistently) able to hang the system solid by 
trying to adjust the sound volume using KAMix on 2.6.7-mm6 (SuSE 9.1/ AMD64).  
This problem does not occur on 2.6.7-mm5, so it's been introduced recently, 
it appears.
Unfortunately, I'm unable to get any oops etc. from the kernel, even on the 
serial console (it only prints four spaces and hangs).  I can only say it's 
unrelated to CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB (it occurs with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB on and off).
The system is a dual Opteron w/ NUMA w/o kernel preemption (hardware info log 
and kernel config attached).
Yours,
rjw
