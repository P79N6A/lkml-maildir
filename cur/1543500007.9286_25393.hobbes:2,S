   It's hard to see what we'd gain by modifying the PALcode.
   The Alpha supports a KSEG similar to MIPS.  The kernel lives in
   this 40-bit hardware supported region requiring no tlb misses at
   all.
Yes but there is much room for gain in user TLB miss latency.
I'm sure there is good reason why Tru64 does not use the
reference implementation PAL code Linux does :-)
