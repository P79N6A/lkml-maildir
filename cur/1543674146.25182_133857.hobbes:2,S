Hi,
There have been a few other problems reported, including some
by you in 2.5.69 and by Udo Steinberg, also in 2.5.69.
Udo's report is at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105266660108932&w=2
(see the attachments).
I don't see any of these in the kernel bugzilla though,
so I'd suggest entering one there, please.
