The attached patch should make sure kswapd does not free an
excessive number of pages in zone_normal just because the
pages in zone_highmem are difficult to free.
It does give kswapd a large margin to continue putting equal
pressure on all zones in normal situations.
Sami, could you try out this patch to see if it helps your
situation?
