But would it be possible to apply a sort of "Linux Server Tuning Best
Practices" method to items not unlike NUMA, but more specific to say,
webserver and file serving?
(this is a project i am working on, finding kernel and apache tuning
guidelines for maximum File/Web serving speed w/ the 2.4 kernel)
- Note, if anyone has any pointers, please let me know.

FWIW, large system scalability, especially NUMA is not tractable with a 'one
size (algorithm) fits all' approach, and can be a significant test of the
degree of modularity in your system.  Different relative costs of access to
the different levels of the memory hierarchy and different models of cache
concurrency, especially, tend to make what works for system A be maximally
pessimal for system B.
