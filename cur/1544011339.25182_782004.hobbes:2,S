It doesn' speed up the system actually. That's not the goal of this patch.
This patch disables completely the tracing on infinite loop in hrtimer, and
tracing will not be reenabled after it. That's too dangerous.
I'm not really proud of this patch, because it is a tricky hack... But
this is the most lightweight solution I've found....
