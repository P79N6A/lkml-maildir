Get the box, turn it on, don't turn it off, pay the 400 EUR, own the box
LEAVING IT ON.
Result: You have a box that is _NOW_ running Linux and YOU own it.
If them placing the box at your place isn't considered distribution
(re: your mobile phone thing) then you BUYING it would need to,
due to transfer of ownership.
The fact that the box can't do what it's supposed to after you buy it
is irrelevant.
