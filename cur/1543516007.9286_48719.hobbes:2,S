So why didn't you look at the kernel sources then? It would have told you
right away:
  2.2.x      no
  2.3.x      work in progress
And as for all 2.3.x kernels: they are _DEVELOPMENT_ kernels and should
not be used in production systems.  So i recommend that you wait for 2.4
before deploying I2O systems using Linux...

Not having an I2O-RAID controller myself (only a PCI-controller form DPT), i
doubt that this is really the case unless you are constantly thrashing the
cache with write requests.  In that case it might be better to rethink the
disk allocation and use more independant SCSI busses.
