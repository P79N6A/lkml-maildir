Whether it did at some point, or whether it didn't, doesn't really matter.
It doesn't need to, and with the amount of memory that most computers come
with these days, remote access storage for tiny kernel data structures, like
that which would be required for tmpfs /dev that is only populated with the
devices that actually exist, just isn't worth it.

I was saying "why do you think this is a good model?" not "I can't imagine
why you would do it..." :-) Sorry it didn't come across as I intended.
