Hi,
I am not sure, if its already reported or not. 
2.6.17-mm2 vfs_statfs() takes a "dentry" instead of "sb".
ecryptfs seems to be broken :(
I get following warnings when I compile it.
fs/ecryptfs/super.c: In function `ecryptfs_statfs':
fs/ecryptfs/super.c:127: warning: passing arg 1 of `vfs_statfs' from
incompatible pointer type
fs/ecryptfs/super.c: At top level:
fs/ecryptfs/super.c:203: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type
Thanks,
Badari
