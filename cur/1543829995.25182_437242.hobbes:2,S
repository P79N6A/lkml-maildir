I think "far too limited for serious kernel monitoring" is not a fair
statement. One can do some very interesting things as I presented
two years ago at OLS:

It's just a _very_ complex subsystem and has a steep learning curve
to do some of the more complex things that one might like.

At first glance, this example sounds more like a limitation of the HW
and not the SW.

Both are useful. I wouldn't say one of necessarily better.
FWIW, the "CPU_CYCLES" counts from pfmon aren't timer based on ia64.
AFAIK, the HW counters are sampled to gather those counts.
