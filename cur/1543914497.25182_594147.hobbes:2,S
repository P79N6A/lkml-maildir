What is not policy is the blacklist or whitelist information.
And I'm also a bit concerned why "is policy" is that much a reason 
against setting *reasonable default policies* without requiring the user 
to do various things in userspace.
Especially since this creates some nasty interdependencies between the 
kernel and userspace.
And as an example, couldn't you equally say it's wrong that the kernel
enables DMA on disks instead of leaving it to userspace?
We've already seen the udev disaster where upgrading from Debian 3.1 to 
Debian 4.0 means upgrading from kernel 2.6.8 to 2.6.18 with the udev 
version in Debian 3.1 not supporting kernel 2.6.18 and the udev version 
in Debian 4.0 not supporting kernel 2.6.8, and I don't have a good 
feeling about outsourcing more and more things to userspace tools not 
distributed with the kernel.
