Just reverting #3[0] on 2.6.16 doesn't fix it either.
Peter, back on 2.6.14.2 for now.
0. one hunk didn't unapply cleanly, and the change was not obvious.  I
   opted for making the beginning of xfs_probe_cluster() look like:
|       /* First sum forwards in this page */
|       do {
|               if (!buffer_uptodate(bh) || (mapped != buffer_mapped(bh)))
|                       return total;
|               total += bh->b_size;
|       } while ((bh = bh->b_this_page) != head);
