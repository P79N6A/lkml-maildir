Hi all,
During boot, i got these two lines in dmesg:
Unknown bridge resource 0: assuming transparent
Unknown bridge resource 2: assuming transparent
What do they mean?
ps: I noticed these because they are written on the console even if quiet
mode is on. There was a patch for 2.4-ac, but it seems that it somehow
lost... :(
