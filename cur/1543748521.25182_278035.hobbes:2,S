Changing the BIOS settings from the default:
With BIOS setting  "Native Mode Operation: [Auto]"
 to:
With BIOS setting  "Native Mode Operation: [Both]"
results in the system working OK with the later kernel.
There is still an issue, however with trying to use two drives and
software RAID. With both drives, or with one drive pulled, the system
boots OK. If the other drive (Channel 3 Master) is pulled, however,
the system fails to boot, after producing the following error messages
- both 2.4.29-pre1-bk5 and 2.6.9 kernels produce very similar messages.
With BIOS setting  "Native Mode Operation: [Both]"
ACPI:PCI interrupt 0000:00:1f.2[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
