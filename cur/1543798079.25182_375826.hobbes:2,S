There are two similar things - struct initializers and compound literals.
They are *not* the same, though; compound literal defines an unnamed
object, so
{
	struct foo x = (struct foo){...};
is equivalent to
	struct foo unnamed_variable = {....};
	struct foo x = unnamed_variable;
For auto variables it's fine; there initializer doesn't have to be
constant.  For globals it's _not_.
Note that it's really a definition of object - e.. you can say
	f(&(struct foo){....});
and have it work just fine.
IOW, DEFINE_SPINLOCK() should be spinlock_t x = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED()
and SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED - (spinlock_t) __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED.  That's
enough to make it valid C99...
