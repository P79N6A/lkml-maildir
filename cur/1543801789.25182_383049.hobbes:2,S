I renumbered the syscalls due to the queued-up sys_migrate_pages.
We don't have changelogs for these patches.  Apart from the usual
what-it-does and how-it-does it I'd really like to be reminded of the
"why".  Adding a bunch of stuff to the core kernel codepaths needs to have
a good reason and I've forgotten your rationale.
We'll need Signed-off_by:'s for all these patches.
In future, please avoid sending multiple patches under the same Subject:,
thanks.
