Yes, they are two different solutions and I agree that there is no
competition.
Where I see the competition is w.r.t memory controllers from different
resource management solutions (RG, UBC, Rohit's container etc.,). That

I wasn't talking about the competition issue in this context.
Let me clearly state it for the record: I support your effort in
providing an independent process aggregation :)
