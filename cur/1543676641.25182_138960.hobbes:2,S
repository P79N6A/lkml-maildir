Because it only appeared to be there to be able to set the parent device
for hierarchically dependent devices. Assuming that is not needed, then 
the EXPORT_SYMBOL() shouldn't be needed, and that device can be declared 
statically. Right?

I'm aware of the necessary ancstral relationship, and I should have 
mentioned this in the first email. Proper ancestral order is maintained by 
virtue of the fact that child devices are registered after parent devices. 
Because of this, they are inserted into the list of system devices after 
their parents, so by walking the list in reverse order, you are guaranteed 
to suspend/shutdown the devices in the right order. 
Note that I ommitted this from the patch and will add it in by the time I 
submit it to Linus.
