1 sector (0.5kbytes), and there are 2000 of those in a megabyte.
So if the odd numbered ones end up remapped, you have 2000 seeks to
perform to read that 1Mb of data. That would come to 2000 * 10ms = 20
seconds. Not quite as bad as several hours, but still....

This supports my statement that if you notice sectors getting bad,
replace the disk as fast as you can, and hope that the sector
remapping bails you out until you get that chance.

Some drives claim "AV compatibility" or something like that. I think
that this means that they will have their spare sectors on the same
cylinder. i.e. no seeking. (just on average 8ms delay).

The problem is that it would be nice if the disk could report: I just
read the data from block XXX for you, but I had a hard time getting it
for you. Recommend reassignment. The OS should then log this, and put
the file that this belongs to elsewhere. This gives the OS the
authority, and the sysop the ability to take appropriate action.
I don't mind a couple of remaps on my mp3 collection. But I rather
hate them on my root drive.
