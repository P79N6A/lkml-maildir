The transaction translators in external high speed hubs require
hosts to issue particular USB transactions.  If the host controller
doesn't implement the that split transaction support, then it won't
be supporting external hubs.
The Mentor USB High Speed Dual Role Host Controller silicon IP (using
the aforementioned musb_hdrc driver) is one example of such silicon.
The "Multipoint" licensing option is basically for the TT support,
as I understand it.
One example of its use in a product is with TI's DaVinci chips.  You
can go to 
http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tms320dm6446.html
and download the USB controller docs.  Ignore the nasty CPPI DMA glued
onto it, and observe that there are host side TX and RX HUB registers
that won't be present on designs that omit the "multipoint" support.
(Which evidently include one of the Blackfin designs.)
