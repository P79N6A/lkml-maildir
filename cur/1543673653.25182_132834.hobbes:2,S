How then do you wrote an application to utilize kernel features? I am
working on a real-time operating system (KURT - www.ittc.ku.edu/kurt)
and need to include a header that exists in the kernel. The header is
installed in the /usr/src/linux/include/linux/ but not in
/usr/include/linux.
Thanks about the report. I got the idea from a library I help work on
called ACE+TAO (www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html).
Stephen
