That is part of the ADMA spec - but in that case, how come the 
pdc_adma.c driver sets the dma_boundary in the SCSI host template to 
4GB? That seems wrong.
In any case, however, I really doubt the NVIDIA ADMA controller shares 
this limitation - they provide 32 bits for the region length (standard 
ADMA only has 16 bits), which wouldn't be very useful if you couldn't 
cross a 64KB boundary..
