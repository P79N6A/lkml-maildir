Well, I use the Bugzilla as a tool for tracking regressions.
You don't need to use or even follow the entries created by me, but some
people do with good results.

Here, I agree, but IMO that's an organizational issue.  We first should assign
people to handling bugs related to various subsystems and based on that create
the menu so that the right people are notified of the reports.

It looks like you'd like the reporter to initially debug the issue for you
before actually reporting it.  I don't think it's realistic. ;-)

Why?
If someone has a problem with 2.6.23.x which has already been fixed in the
mainline, we should be able to point him to the fix.  If we aren't, then
something is wrong on our side.

I, personally, don't like reports with dmesgs and .configs attached from the
start, especially if they are cut'n'pasted into the message window, because
they often don't contain the relevant information.

Sure, improvements are always possible. :-)

IMO, if there's a user who has a problem with _our_ code, we should do our best
to help him even if he doesn't report the bug very well.  Also, if the problem
is not with the most recent kernel, we should at least ask the reporter to try
a newer version.

I agree that we probably should do something like this.

Good idea, IMO.

Well, how would you authenticate?

True and that's why I think there should be some poeple officially resposnible
for handling bugs (which involves talking with the reporter and forwarding the
bug to an appropriate developer if necessary etc.).

Nothing prevents bugreporters from sending emails along with filing Bugzilla
reports.

You can always ask on the list, pointing to the Bugzilla entry in question.

Alternatively, we can give a Bugzilla link here pointing to the entry which
contains a pointer to the original discussion.  [This may be more convenient,
since some bugs are reported multiple times and tracked separately to the point
in which it turns out that they really are the same.]

This obviously is a matter for discussion.
I think that many bugs have been lost, because they haven't be recorded
anywhere and the Bugzilla is a place where you can record information about
the bug with some references to more information, if need be.  [BTW, that's
exactly what I use it for.]

Well, that doesn't matter to me as long as it's useful.  Any ideas how to
improve that? ;-)

I agree.

I think that we just have to get an idea of what exactly is needed.  IOW, we
need to know exactly how we're going to handle bugs as much as we needed
to know exactly how we were going the handle the flow of changes.
Perhaps it would be necessary to use a proprietary bug tracking system for some
time for this purpose, but _maybe_ we can figure it out without anything like
that.
The first, most important, step is to realize that we have a problem ...
