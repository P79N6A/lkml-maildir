Hi,
i wrote here already that i have trouble with my PLEXTOR x40TSi that
does not play audio-cd's unsing the cdplay tool. I now recompiled the
sources with "make scsi" and found that the programmer replaced the
CDROMPLAYTRKIND with CDROMPLAYMSF and a MSF calculation routine. But
is the CDROMPLAYTRKIND function only marked as recommend for SCSI
CDR's or have my drive a bug ?!
