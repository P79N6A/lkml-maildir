Either don't use a broken compiler (casting a const pointer to a non-const 
is definitely not a bug), or cast to "unsigned long" (if it still 
complains, now the compiler is not just stupid, it's broken).
The whole point of memory management is that we know how pointers work, 
and understand that they have a *bit* representation, not just the C 
semantics.
