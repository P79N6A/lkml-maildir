for userland it's not that complex and exists already; basically gprof
has this analysis capability, and from that there's tooling (well I
wrote it and I'm sure others did too) to create a linker script
automatically to order things according to their gprof desired order.
This gprof based approach is taking actual runtime patterns into account
not just static callgraph analysis.
For the kernel the runtime measurement is obviously tricky (kgprof
anyone?) but the static analysis method really shouldn't be too hard.
(well I guess "optimal" will be NP complete, but "pretty damn close"
ought to be reasonable)
