    So the non-commercial CC license is not enforceable (at least in
your country)?. Here in Spain I don't know if that is enforceable or
not, but to my (limited) knowledge, you can restrict something so the
recipient cannot use it for commercial purposes. If any spaniard
could tell something sensible about this issue I would be grateful.

    Will in this case the NC+share-alike CC license work?

    I see that this is for US: do you know if the same applies to
European countries, for example? I think that our copyright laws are
very different, but I cannot swear it, 'cause copyrigth is a complex
issue no matter the country.
