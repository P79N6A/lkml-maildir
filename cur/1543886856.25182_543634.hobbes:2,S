From the point of view of syncing it's only necessary to make sure that we
won't freeze a kernel thread that's needed for the syncing.  We can have an
additional user space task running at this point.

Hmm, I'm not sure if the task can call try_to_freeze() after doing exit().
May it happen?

Yes.  Still, I think the daemonize()ed threads should clear their TIF_FREEZE
flag unconditionally right after they have called exit_mm().  So that would be
in daemonize().
Or, perhaps, it's better to clear TIF_FREEZE (unconditionally) in exit_mm(),
after we've done tsk->mm = NULL?  Oleg, what do you think?
