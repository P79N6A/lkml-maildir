ACPI works quite ok on my laptop, currently running 2.6.8, but when i
resume from suspend the second time after a boot i get the following
message:
    ACPI-0286: *** Error: No installed handler for fixed event [00000002]
and the acpi subsystems seem to stop sending events, as no scripts
gets called after this. Anyone had similar problems? I really would
like to have working suspend/resume more than once after each reboot
;)
