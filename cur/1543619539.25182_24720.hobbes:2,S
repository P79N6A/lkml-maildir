Nice work!  This could turn out to be a useful tool for those of us
working on reliable low-latency kernels.  I certainly agree that it is a
much better solution than adaptive spinlocks (which dynamically decide
when to sleep) as the kernel programmer should always know whether a
spinlock or a sleep lock is more appropriate.
Unfortunately, as you point out, it's not as useful as it may first
appear in the short term, because last time I looked into the problem of
long-held spinlocks they were all nested under other spinlocks and/or
the BKL.
