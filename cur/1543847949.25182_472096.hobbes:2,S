Well, we have the read-ahead, and then the real read. By the time we do 
the real read, we have forgotten about the read-ahead details, so..
We also end up often having a _third_ one, simply because the _user_ tries 
it twice: it gets a partial IO read first, and then tries to continue and 
won't give up until it gets a real error.
So yes, we can end up reading it even more than twice, if only due to 
standard UNIX interfaces: you always have to have one extra "read()" 
system call in order to get the final error (or - much more commonly - 
EOF, of course).
If we tracked the read-aheads that _we_ started, we could probably get rid 
of one of them.
