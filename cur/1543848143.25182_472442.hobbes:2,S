Yes. Do an atomic copy, which will early exit from the pagefault handler
and return a short copy. Then close up the write, drop the page lock,
and rerun the fault_in_pages_readable, which will do the full pagefaults
for us, then try again.
Regardless of what you do to ext3, the VM just can't handle a fault
here anyway.
