Yes, it's replacement for the Frontpage Server Extensions not for network
filesystems. How you'll handle mmap with DAV & HTTP (typical file operation;
grep uses it) ?  Or just random access ? Something like Berkeley DB 1.x ?
If you'll not implement this then a lot of program will not work anyway so
you'll not got much benefits over libvfs solution...

Then use some application with support for HTTP and WebDAV :-) ftpfs is not
much harder but even if ftp exists for quite a few years we do not have
working ftpfs in kernel. So I'm pessimistic here.

But it's doable and I'm [almost] sure that it will be done. Filesystem solution
on other hand is REALLY hard to do. We do not have robust smbfs let alone davfs.
But you can try to implement it (if you crazy enough) of course ...
