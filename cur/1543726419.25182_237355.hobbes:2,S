Most of the kernel is buggy.
Most of the kernel is unmaintained.
Drop code when it has become superfluous - the same functionality
is provided by other parts, less buggy, or better maintained, or
with other redeeming features. (But very slowly - try to preserve
kernel interface stability for several years.)
Drop code when it has become superfluous - the functionality is
not needed any more.
Drop code when it is broken - some change somewhere broke it,
and no kernel developer has the knowledge, or desire, or time,
to fix it.
Drop code when it has become a burden - when the need to keep it working
causes complications al over the place.
