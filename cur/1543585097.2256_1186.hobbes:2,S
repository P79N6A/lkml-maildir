Hi,
kgdb, kernel source level debugger for x86 linux is available now.
Please visit 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
 for downloading.
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/linux-2.4.2-kgdb.patch
 is the debugger
patch for 2.4.2 linux kernel.
This version of kgdb has much better support for threads and nmi
watchdog.
Correct register contents for all threads can be seen now.
nmi watchdog is also handled correctly without hangs.
Unlike previous version, status of threads running on other cpus
is reported correctly in case of nmi watchdog occurrance.
Thanks to Dave Grothe for helping me in improving nmi watchdog support.
Regards.
Amit S. Kale
