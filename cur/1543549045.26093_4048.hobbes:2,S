I've finally had a chance to test out the new VM patch on my 32mb system.
It runs much, much better than the previous test8, and the pages->swap change
is actually much smoother than I had expected it to be considering the recent
talk about making it more gradual. I'm against having the swap more gradual
because of the low amount of available memory and the high amount of memory
actually taken up by processes required for normal operation.
At the moment, there's only room for about 5-6 meg of cache. If a gradual swap
goes into effect, then I'm afraid that the processes that actually 'need' to
stay in memory will start swapping out and thrashing, even when there's 6 meg
still available for use. This was precisely the problem with the old VM on my
machine, only the system wanted to keep 16 meg free for cache (*gag*).
So, please take my opinions into consideration when/if you redesign the swap
mechanism.
Regards,
 Byron
