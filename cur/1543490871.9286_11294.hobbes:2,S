Hi.
I haven't seen anything about this in the archives, so 
hopefully this isn't a rehash.
I'm using an IBM token ring adapter in my dual-pentium
box.  Under 2.0.36, I occasionally had problems with
the card, and I'd get something like "Argh.  Adapter busy".
Usually I could bring the interface down and back
up again and this would clear it up, although sometimes
it required a reboot.
Now, under 2.2.4, I get this sort of thing all the time,
and the only thing that fixes it is a reboot.  And the
driver begins spewing these errors after about 15 minutes
without fail.
That's not the weird part, though.
A straight "ping router-ip" fails.
"telnet router-ip" doesn't fail.
"nslookup router" fails.
"telnet dnshostip" doesn't fail.
The other weird part is that if I get a ping series
started prior to the "transmitter busy" error, the 
pings will continue, but I see round-trip times on 
the order of 10s of seconds. 
None of the other computers on this floor seem to
have any problems.  (I'm attempting to replace the
card, but we apparently don't have any available.)
Ideas?
