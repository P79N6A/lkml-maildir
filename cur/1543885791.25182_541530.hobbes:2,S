It won't?  I thought the issue (from the fix) is that cgc->buffer is
outside of the device accessibility mask.  The scsi_execute path
allocates a request and then calls blk_rq_map_kern on the buffer (in
this case cgc->buffer) ... the problem is that blk_rq_map_kern() doesn't
currently bounce the buffer, but if it did (which is the functionality
Mike's patch adds), surely the need to bounce it in the ioctl path would
go away?
