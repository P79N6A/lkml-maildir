Its not a buggy gcc. Well its a less buggy gcc than 2.95 or egcs 1.1.2
The problem is the *kernel* side of things. The compiler folks keep getting
the blame for things that are not their fault. Every bug I've chased down
bar one and every fix I've merged from others for gcc 2.95 support in 2.2.x
for example has been the kernel code not stopping some legal but undesired
optimisation or incorrect asm constraints
The only case that 2.95 was at fault is strstr() miscompiles which 2.96
snapshots actually got right.

Build with kgcc. See the 7.0 release notes and/or tweak the Makefile.
