A bit more complicated due to switching of stacks but that's basically
it.  With this clone model using n+1 threads is the only way to get
the semantics right.

Exactly.  This is holding off everything.  The way this is solved
(basically: the limitations imposed on the userland implementation)
will determine much of the implementation.
I've done already a great deal of the implementation when Linus first
put the code in the late 2.3 kernels.  If somebody finally would get
the signal handling stuff done (and a few more little things, some
Linus already agreed on) we could have a compliant pthread
implementation soon.
