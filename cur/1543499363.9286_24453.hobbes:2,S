There is one definite problem with tulip.c that tends to show up under
heavy load.  The MAC filter is incorrectly set so the card can send but
not receive.
"The ownership bit of the first descriptor of the frame should be set
after all subsequent descriptors belonging to the same frame have been
set. This avoids a possible race condition between the 21143 fetching a
descriptor and the driver setting an ownership bit."

There are also other problems that I see on a Xircom RBEM56G pcmcia
(2114x based), to do with changing CSR6 while the transmitter and/or
receiver are running.  I plan to send all my updates to Donald Becker
later this month, he is away at the moment.
