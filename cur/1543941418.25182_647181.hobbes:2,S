I'm getting way too many compilation errors from this, perhaps because of
new rcu-list usages which weren't present in the old tree (ie: current
Linus mainline) which you tested it against.
The most practical way to prepare a patch like this is to either make it
back-compatible (for a while at least) or to prepare and carefully test it
against latest -mm.  That way you'll pick up everyone's new code.
