You get duplicated blocks though. But yes, I agree - write-backs to the
disk must be ordered, other it's going to be too unreliable in practice.
An in-memory buffer for a log-structured block device.

You could switch from a journal like the above to a bitmap when this
overrun occurs. (Typical problem in replication.) SteelEye holds a
patent on that though, as far as I know.
