There are MMX implementations of clear_page().
I was experimenting with SSE[2] clear_page() which uses
non-temporal stores. That one requires 16 byte alignment.
BTW, it worked ~300% faster than memset. But Andi Kleen
insists that cache eviction caused by NT stores will make it
slower in macrobenchmark.
Apart from fairly extensive set of microbechmarks
I tested kernel compiles (i.e. "real world load")
and they are FASTER too, not slower, but Andi
is fairly entrenched in his opinion ;)
I gave up.
