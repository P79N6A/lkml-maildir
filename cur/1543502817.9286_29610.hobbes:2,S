Splitting an N-job scheduling task into an M-job low-level scheduling 
tasks and a single N/M-job high-level scheduling task is a win.  
In theory.
In practice it depends.  There's a list traversal in schedule() that would
speed up if you have a whole bunch of threads and you split the scheduling
into two levels, but it's probably going to take a lot of runnable tasks 
before this loop dominates the other overhead, and at that point a bit of
overhead in schedule() is probably the least of your worries.
