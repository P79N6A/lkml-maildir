Yes - later ARM binutils adds extra symbols like "$a" and "$d" to the
symbol table as "mapping symbols" (binutils terminology).  It's not
clear whether these will continue to be visible via normal tools or
not, and I was considering getting kallsyms to filter them out.
Depending on the outcome of the binutils side depends whether or not
I end up modifying kallsyms to ignore these symbols and whether we
end up saying "binutils earlier than <todays latest and greatest
release> can not be used for ARM."
If a release of binutils is imminent which solves both the mapping
symbol visibility problem and the undefined symbol issue, then I
suspect its just all round easier to prevent the ARM kernel being
built with older binutils versions.
