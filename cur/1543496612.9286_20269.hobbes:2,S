Assuming for a moment that we are *not* fixing the wrong thing:  Novell
did something like this in Netware 4 with their "block suballocation".
You can set up a volume to be based on 4K, 16K, 32K, or 64K blocks, but if
you enable suballocation then tiny files get stuffed into the unused
tail-ends of the final blocks of large files.  No, I don't know the
details of how they do it.  It seems to work pretty well.  I always set up
a Netware server for 64K blocks with suballocation unless I can think of a
specific reason why it won't perform well given the server's specific
tasks.
But I agree that taking a broader view of the problem is worthwhile.
