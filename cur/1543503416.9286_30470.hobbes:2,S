For more NE2000 info, a good place to find some datasheets and
app notes is www.national.com . Search for "NE2000".
Yes, by "alias" I mean that the address decode logic on the
adapter may choose to ignore some of the low-order address bits.
Since the data transfer reg. at base + 0x10 is 16 bits,
I would expect

or

to be more like
  0360-0371 : eth0
Otherwise, looks good.
