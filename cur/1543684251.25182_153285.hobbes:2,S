Interesting :)
Maybe, it should cause no action to "mkdir /proc/mods/ipv6", nor echo
"psmouse_noext=1" > /proc/mods/psmouse/options
_just_ "collecting" parameters by kernel, then eg creating a file
/proc/mods/ipv6/load should cause to load the module. Of course there can be
code to handle "on-the-fly" parameter change, but maybe this can be
considered as optimal, and it should be not a must a module to support this
