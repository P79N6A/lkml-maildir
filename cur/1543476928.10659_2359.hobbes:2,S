I am trying to determine the most popular platform for Linux.  Specifically,
what version is the most common (4.5?).  I have seen a couple of versions at the
retail shelf and I am trying to target one particular version for a driver
release.
Please mail jacob_hawley@msn.com if you have an opinion you would like to
express.
Thanks
