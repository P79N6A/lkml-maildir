You are retrying (for 0<order<=3) but without draining the pcps (in your
patch).

Basically the get_cpu(), put_cpu() needs to cover the whole scope of
smp_processor_id usage.  (When you enable CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT the
kernel will barf if preempt is enabled while calling smp_processor_id).
If the interrupts are disabled all the way through then you wouldn't be
preempted though.  But get/put_cpu is the right mechanism to ensure
smp_processor_id and its derived value is used on same processor.

Please let me know if you see any issues with the patch that I sent out
a bit earlier.
