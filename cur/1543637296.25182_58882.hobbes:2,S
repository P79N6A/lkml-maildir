I agree in part. Take the initialiser patches you're currently carrying
for example. Whilst they're more useful (and more likely) to get merged
than the enum patches, they also have the annoying issue that anyone
currently working on code near those gets shafted.
With large touching patches like these, the only way to not piss people
off is to find out who's working on a particular area, and work with
them. "Can you roll this into your current working tree, and push to
Linus next time". Instead of just shovelling straight to Linus.
(Note, you did seem to actually seem to do the right thing here FWICS.
 have a gold star to go alongside your recent black one).
