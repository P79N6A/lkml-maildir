a nice thing for that would be to have unionfs (al viro seems to work on that?),
and mount a ramdisk ontop of your var directory (or shichever directory is
a hotspot. - or mount it over your whole harddrive, doing COW on the ramdisk.
and once the disk reaches a critical high-water-mark sync the whole set to
the underlaying "real" filesystem.
any comments?
