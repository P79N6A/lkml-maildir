I got two DEC 21140 based cards yesterday, and they work well enough
with my a crossover RJ45 cable. However I get problems if one of the
PCs is turned off.
The startup messages:
Jul  4 22:13:28 nemesis kernel: tulip.c:v0.89H 5/23/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov 
Jul  4 22:13:28 nemesis kernel: eth0: Digital DS21140 Tulip at 0xf600, 00 00 e8 2b ba 28, IRQ 11.

Jul  4 22:13:28 nemesis kernel: eth0:  Index #0 - Media 10baseT (#0) described by a 21140 non-MII (0) block. 
Jul  4 22:13:28 nemesis kernel: eth0:  Index #1 - Media 100baseTx (#3) described by a 21140 non-MII (0) block.

Jul  4 22:13:28 nemesis kernel: eth0:  MII transceiver found at MDIO address 1, config 3100 status 7809. 
I get this logged continually once a minute or so, and also flooded to the
console..
Jul  4 22:13:34 nemesis kernel: eth0: No link beat on the MII interface,
status then 7809 now 7809. 
What should I do to stop this?
regards,
Dave.
