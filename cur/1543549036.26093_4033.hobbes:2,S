Ok. I think we're getting to the point where there are no major known
bugs. That means that as of the final 2.4.0-test9 I will no longer accept
any patches that don't have a critical problem (as defined by Teds list)
associated with them. 
So when you send me a patch, either bug Ted to mark the issue as
"critical" first, or pay me money. It's that easy.

----
 - pre1:
    - USB: OHCI controller unlink and bandwidth reclamation fixes
    - USB: storage update
    - sparc64: register window race. Non-deadlock rwlocks.
    - name clash in hamradio/pi2.c and hamradio/pt.c  
    - epic100 credits, 8139too driver update, sr.c initcalls
    - acenic update
    - NFS sillyrename fixups
    - mktime(). Do it just once - not 16 times.
    - misc small fixes to random drivers by Tigran
    - IDE driver picks up master/slave relationships on its own.
    - truncate unmapped/uptodate case handled correctly
    - don't do notifier locking at low level: higher levels do (or
      should do) this already. 
    - ACPI interpreter updates (and file renames - making this part big)
    - SysKonnect gigabit driver update
    - 3c59x driver update
    - pcmcia debounce logic. Ugh.
    - MM balancing (Rik Riel)
 - pre2:
    - "extern inline" -> "static inline".  It doesn't matter right now,
      but it's proactive for future gcc versions.
    - various net drvr updates and fixes
    - more initcall updates
    - PPC updates (including PPC-related drivers etc)
    - disallow re-mounting same filesystem in same place multiple times.
      Too confusing. And /etc/mtab gets strange.
    - Riel VM update
    - sparc updates
    - PCI bridge scanning fix: assign numbers properly
    - network updates
    - scsi fixes
