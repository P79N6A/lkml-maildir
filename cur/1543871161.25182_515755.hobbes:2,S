It _appears_ that the bug reports started after an update of
bluez-utils, but this remains to be confirmed. It could be
coincidence/temporal correlation (which does not imply causation).
As for myself, I have a Logitech MX5000 keyboard/mouse with usb dongle,
and I can confirm that the keyboard/mouse have always worked in HID.
But in HID mode, no other bluetooth functions are possible (like pairing
with a smartphone).
It's possible to switch from HID to HCI and have a working mouse
+bluetooth receiver, but in that case the keyboard can't pair.
I used this script to get functional bluetooth (and unresponsive
keyboard):
hid2hci --tohci
sleep 1
/etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
sleep 1
# connect with the mouse
hidd -i hci0 --connect 00:07:61:48:71:DE
# connect with the keyboard
hidd -i hci0 --connect 00:07:61:3F:DA:41
I think the "-i hci0" isn't even needed, but it can't hurt.
This triggers a lot of occurences of the following in my logs:

 =======================
There are a few Ubuntu bug reports that describe the problem, with some
log files and other useful info:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/bluez-utils/+bug/32415
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/bluez-utils/+bug/66884/
I have found similar descriptions in other distros.
I have exactly the same experience as Vincent Fortier described
(keyboard working at boot, some keys repeating sometimes, keyboard
unresponsive when bluetooth comes up, keyboard works again after dongle
unplug/replug, but no bluetooth)
Anyway, is this a kernel problem or is bluez-utils to blame?
PS: I bumped into this topic when googling for "046d:c70e". I'm not a
developer (I'm what they call "a user"), but I'm not afraid to get my
hands dirty. If you want me to run debug versions or patched kernels, I
can do that. After all, I have the hardware and I might give you
valuable information (even if I wouldn't recognise it when it spat me in
the face).
