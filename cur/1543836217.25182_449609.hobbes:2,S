You mean make the standard bit-ops atomic on UP when compiling for 
CONFIG_PARAVIRT?  We think its too much of a burden; there are only a 
few operations which must be locked in the hypervisor case, and bit ops 
are used everywhere.  I'd like to get it to the point where there's no 
significant overhead in configuring for PARAVIRT, even if you run on 
native hardware.
