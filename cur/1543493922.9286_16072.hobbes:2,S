Visit www.datafellows.com, click on the "CIH" link on the first page. It
will tell you about the virus, and yes, it does trash the disk -then-
attempt to write to CMOS. If your board isn't an Intel 430TX or if the CMOS
flash jumper is not enabled, it will not mess with your CMOS. It does,
however, screw over your partition tables. I have two PCs right here that
are currently not functional because of this. Does anyone know if Norton
DiskDoctor might be able to fix the partition tables and at least recover
some data?
