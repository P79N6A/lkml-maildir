SECTION 1 - CREATING AND SENDING YOUR CHANGE

1) Creating a diff file
-----------------------
You can use git-diff(1) or git-format-patch(1) which makes your life easy. If
you want it to be more difficult then carry on reading.

The first mentionings of the string "git" in the document are in this 
line.
SubmittingPatches should teach newbies how to create good patches with 
GNU diff, and random references to git programs don't help anyone.
If a submitter is using a git-based workflow he most likely has a 
comletely different wotkflow than the one described in SubmittingPatches -
and git-specific documents should cover what he should do.
