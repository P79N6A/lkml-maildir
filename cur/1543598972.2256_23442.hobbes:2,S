multipath routing is really not complicated; I don't know why it "sounds"
complicated to you. Of course you could always add new features to the kernel
because the existing ones which do the same thing in a better way
"sound complicated" to someone; I doubt it is a good use of developer time 
however. 
BTW when you would teach bonding about flows it wouldn't be layer-2 anymore.
To kill the "sounds complicated" myth: 
ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 nexthop dev eth0 nexthop dev eth1 
gives you a multipath route with eth0 and eth1 with the same weight for 
10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0. If you replace 10.0.0.0/8 with default it'll
be your default route. The kernel does the rest.
