The benchmark was run against this one:
[root@candle lanforge]# ifconfig --version
net-tools 1.57
ifconfig 1.40 (2000-05-21)
The latest I could find anywhere....  Please tell me the version of a
newer one if it exists.

I'm going to write something that binds to a raw device, which is something
users (DHCP, for sure) does.  If it does not show any significant improvement,
then I'll drop the issue untill many-many interfaces are more common.

I was just trying to smooth VLAN's adoption into the kernel by removing the
one linear-lookup that I know of relating to lots of VLANs.  It obviously
isn't horribly important, but it was fun :)

That is still linear in the kernel...or do you mean cache in the kernel?  At any
rate, I'm more concerned about random access.
