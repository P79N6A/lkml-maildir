I'm not addressing you specifically, but I will note how great
you tend to say ia64 is when platform performance comparison
discussions happen on the lists :-)
In general, I think some platform maintainence drifts way too easily
into a tail-spin of local changes that take forever to get merged.
My point was that if some random single monkey like me can keep a
loser platform like sparc64 still building in Linus's tree, a group of
several trained professionals should be able to fare much better :)
