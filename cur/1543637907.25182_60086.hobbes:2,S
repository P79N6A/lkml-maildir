Recursive read locks certainly make it more difficult to fix the
problem.  Placing a band-aid on gettimeofday will fix the symptom
in one location, but will not fix the general problem, which is
writer starvation with heavy read lock load.  The only way to fix
that is to make writer locks fair or to eliminate them (make them
_all_ stateless).
Recursive read locks also imply that you can't replace them with
a "normal" spinlock, which would also solve the problem (although
they do _not_ scale under contention -- something like O(N^2)
cache-cache transfers for N processors to acquire once).
There are ways of fixing the writer starvation and allowing recursive
read locks, but that is more work (and heavier-weight than desirable).
How pervasive are recursive reader locks?  Should they be a special
type of reader lock?
