  I'm not the only one who has had this problem... there isn't a person on
  the SANE list with a stable SMP machine and a BusLogic controller. So
  the problem is at least with several common scanners.
Do these same systems run stably with uniprocessor kernels using the identical
hardware configuration?  If so, that would be very interesting.  My experience
from corresponding with Mylex's HBA Technical Support has been that a large
number of scanners had compatibility problems.  I would suggest that the first
thing anyone do who is having scanner problems would be to contact Mylex and
see if they are already aware of problems with a particular scanner.
I notice that you are using your Microtek connected to the external 68pin
connector on a BT-958.  There are certainly wide to narrow cables or adapters
that do not work properly, and if the scanner only has a 25pin pseudo-SCSI
conenctor, you will almost certainly have problems.
