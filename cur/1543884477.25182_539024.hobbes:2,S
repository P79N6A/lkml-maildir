The coincidental aspect would be that at the time it was written, the
formal notion of lag was not being used particularly with respect to
priorities and load weights. The documentation doesn't describe it in
those terms, and I can't read minds, so I refrained from guessing.
Things are moving in good directions on all this as far as I'm
concerned. Moving according to Ting Yang's analysis should wrap up the
soundness concerns about intra-queue policy I've had. OTOH load
balancing I know much less about (not that I was ever any sort of an
expert on single queue affairs). That remains a very deep concern, as
load balancing is where most of the enterprise performance improvements
and degradations occur.
