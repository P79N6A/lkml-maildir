I have a cleanup patch that allows this sort of thing to easily
be passed into the lower levels of reclaim functions. I don't
know if it would be to Andrew's taste though...
It basically replaces all function parameters in vmscan.c with
struct scan_control {
	unsigned long nr_to_scan;
	unsigned long nr_scanned;
	unsigned long nr_reclaimed;
	unsigned int gfp_mask;
	struct page_state ps;
	int may_writepage;
};
So you could easily add a field for swsusp.
Until something like this goes through, please don't fuglify
vmscan.c any more than it is... do the saving and restoring
thing that Nigel suggested please.
