No. You should simply read RFC1855.
If you're in a public place, you do something "rude", someone approaches
you privately and quitly explains what is wrong instead of doing it
in public, do you then jump on the table and yell through a bullhorn
"this guy thinks he knows better"? If so, you're probably not from
the same planet I am.
But I guess you're probably not much fun on parties anyway..
Mike.
