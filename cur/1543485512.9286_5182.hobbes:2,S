    I guess I mean: In a standard VGA console, can you bring up a Euro symbol
    by pressing the right keyboard combination?  Anyone know what this 
    combination *is*?  Keyboards nowadays are having the "Euro" symbol printed
    on the "E" key...
*is*?
That is determined by you.
You do "setfont lat0-16; loadkeys euro; cat" and type Alt-E
and see that cat echoes an Euro symbol.
(This is with kbd-0.97.)
But you are completely free to choose where you want it on the keyboard.
