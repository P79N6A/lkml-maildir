I had similar problems. Turns out you have to be careful what you compile
with. 
I.e. : suppose you had a gcc-2.7.2 installation, with libraries in 
/usr/lib. You install egcs compiler in /usr/local/lib. Now you got two
sets of libraries in /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib. 
And you have two sets of gcc compilers in /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin.
Now I was lucky - my root user had (by accident) /usr/local/bin earlier in
the path than /usr/bin/. Normal users didn't and I had a weird problem
when compile failed or succeded based on what user run it.
The problem is that ./configure scripts look in /usr/bin for gcc compiler
by default. So if your default compiler is egcs, they will try to use
libraries belonging to the old compiler with the new compiler. The result
is the program that segfaults. 
Note that simply removing /usr/bin/gcc doesn't help. In that case
./configure (in all programs) says that it doesn't know what host it is
running on. You really have to make a link in /usr/bin/ to the actual gcc
running.
If you really want to keep several compilers on your system my advice is
to name them like gcc-2.7.2 , gcc-2.8.1, egcs and make /usr/bin/gcc a link
to them. Same stands for g++.

PS I also forgot - the order in ld.so.conf also matters - this will decide
on the choice of libraries.
PSS The symptom of this is when during the build you get ld warning's
about two similar libraries
