the original atm code used atm_dev_lock to keep the device from
disappearing during the ioctl.  atm_dev_lock was being used to protect
sections of code, like ioctl and atm device (de)registry.  the 2.5
code is getting changes that should improve matters.  atm_dev will
now have a reference count to keep a device from being unregistered
while someone holds a reference (ioctl or otherwise).

i believe proc has always been a troublesome child.  it has never
had any protection (via atm_dev_lock or otherwise).  you can sleep
in the proc function (since it would in user mode).  i have added some
locking to proc in the 2.5 that should make proc safer (but not very
elegant--perhaps elegance with come with the seq conversion).
