Is there a standard for how to name hardware entries in 
/sys/devices/system (or sysfs in general)?  Seems like this
same general issue would apply to other hardware components,
cpus, nodes, etc.

If we're talking about specific hardware entries, it seems like they
should be called what they are.  If we're talking about abstractions,
a more abstract name seems in order.  One of my concerns is mapping 
failures back to hardware components, hence my bias for component names.
Would having /sys/.../memory/LMB on ppc64 to correspond to 
/sys/.../memory/DIMM be a problem?  RAM would be an alternative,
but that could be confused with /sys/block/ram.  :-)
In general, I'm more concerned with getting the necessary functionality
in than what the specific entries are called, so I'll go along with
the consensus.
