I don't think it will be that bad, actually.  I'll see how it works to
just move skb-based code into a single source file and build it iff
CONFIG_NET.

I have a hack that lets me compile-test, which I used to make sure I was
getting sparse annotations and header inclusions into decent shape.

I'll take a look.

They're not obviously defined to operate on atomic_t objects, but what
you say makes sense.  I guess that's a peril of using macros for that
stuff.

Ah.

There is no duplicated SMA code.  There are two routines in ipathfs that
handle nodeinfo and portinfo structures, but they're for passing them to
userspace; they don't even really resemble the code in ipath_mad.c.
Regarding "ipath_verbs doesn't work without ib_mad loaded", I don't know
that there's a problem there any more.  We took out the use of
ib_register_mad_agent to create an automatic dependency that depmod
would find, and we're just recommending mangling modprobe.conf instead
for now.

That's possible.  Andrew, what's your opinion on that?

That's true; sorry about that.  Do you want me to send you a patch that
drops it and pulls it out of headers and kbuild stuff?
