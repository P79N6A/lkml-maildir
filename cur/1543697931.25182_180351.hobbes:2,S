Well, I ran about 6 different compiles each on a patched and an unpatched,
and my 'average' savings were about 1 second per 6 minute compile, which is
negligible.  I wonder if doing a make is a good test of this.  Can anyone else
out there come up with another way to check this with a non-cpu hog
application?  I'd like some other cases to test this in.  I mean, when you do 
a 'large' number of compiles that each take a half second, I can see
that saving a division and an addition really wouldn't make a big difference,
but in a situation where you have a large number of short lived threads in
a child process, it may end up saving a bit more.
