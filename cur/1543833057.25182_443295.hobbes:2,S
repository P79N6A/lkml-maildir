I'm a bit confused.
The last time I tried submitting a patch that followed that style (for
__iowrite_copy*), it got NAKed for propagating preprocessor abuse (Linus
roundly flamed someone for a similar patch a few weeks before I
submitted mine), and Andrew suggested that I use the same scheme that
this patch uses.
So whose instructions do I follow?  Yours of today, or Andrew's and
Linus's of a few months ago?
