yeah. A bit more sophisticated method would be to use a new sticky 
IRQ_SPURIOUS bit and only print a warning if it goes from 0 to 1. 
Whenever a real handler is installed the bit gets cleared. This will 
make behavior a bit more deterministic than 'once per bootup', and it 
will still not spam the box with printks. (Or never let that bit go from 
1 to 0 - this effectively implements the once-per-bootup warning.)

hm, doesnt note_interrupt()/irqpoll detect and handle this to a certain 
degree?
