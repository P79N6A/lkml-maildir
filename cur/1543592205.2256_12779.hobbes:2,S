True, but if we have resources available there's no excuse for a
failure.  Well, yes there is.  If the cost of that resource is
higher than the value of letting the allocation succeed.  We have
no data on the value of success, but we do plan on consuming the
reclaimable pool and do that (must), so I still think turning
these resources loose at strategic moments is logically sound.
(doesn't mean there's not a better way.. it's just an easy way)
I'd really like someone who has this problem to try the patch to
see if it does help.  I don't have this darn problem myself, so
I'm left holding a bag of idle curiosity. ;-)
