[A somewhat belated question...]
As I read the patch, I find the async_entry structure:
> +struct async_entry {
> +	struct list_head list;
> +	async_cookie_t   cookie;
> +	async_func_ptr	 *func;
> +	void             *data;
> +	struct list_head *running;
> +};
The "running" field is, presumably, meant to hold a pointer to the
"running" queue to be used when this function is actually run.  But, then,
I see:
> +async_cookie_t async_schedule(async_func_ptr *ptr, void *data)
> +{
> +	return __async_schedule(ptr, data, &async_pending);
> +}
> +EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(async_schedule);
It seems to me that you wanted &async_running there, no?
However, it doesn't matter in the current form of the patch:

Given the way things are designed, don't you want to add the entry to
entry->running, rather than unconditionally to async_running?  If not, I
don't see how calls to async_synchronize_cookie_special() can work right.
Of course, I'm probably just confused...enlighten me?
Thanks,
