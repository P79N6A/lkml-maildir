Subject: [PATCH] fs/locks.c: Fix posix locking for threaded tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Saurabh Desai believes that locks created by threads should not conflict
with each other.  I'm inclined to agree; I don't know why the test for
->fl_pid was added, but the comment suggests that whoever added it wasn't
sure either.
Frankly, I have no clue about the intended semantics for threads, and
SUS v3 does not offer any enlightenment.  But it seems reasonable that
processes which share a files_struct should share locks.  After all,
if one process closes the fd, they'll remove locks belonging to the
other process.
Here's a patch generated against 2.4; it also applies to 2.5.
Please apply.
