Oh, just to keep anyone interested up to date:  It turns out nearly all
of the inordinate performance degredation I was seeing in the last set
of results which I reported was due to a prefetch weirdness on my ppc64
test system.  In particular, the hlist_for_each_entry macro automatically
prefetches tmp->next.  Since my tests were done with selinux+capability,
it was the case that tmp->next was always NULL (which always causes a
bad prefetch case on ppc64) and, to boot, never used, since the
comparison inside the loop always succeeded and immediately returned
the first entry.
A new set of results should hopefully be coming next week.
