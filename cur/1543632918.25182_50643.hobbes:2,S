Yes, same thing.
It looks like BIO_MAX_FOO needs to become an API function.
Question is: what should it return? Number of sectors, number
of bytes or number of pages?
For my purposes, I'd prefer number of pages.  ie: the vector
count which gets passed into bio_alloc:
	unsigned bio_max_iovecs(struct block_device *bdev);
	nr_iovecs = bio_max_iovecs(bdev);
	bio = bio_alloc(GFP_KERNEL, nr_iovecs);
would suit.
And if, via this, we can submit BIOs which are larger than 64k
for the common "it's just a disk" case then that is icing.
