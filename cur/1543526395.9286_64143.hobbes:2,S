hello Jim,
before all, thank you for your help.
I am trying to do a different Shared Memory implementation in linux
so i want to allocate some special memory from the user space and
then change its pagefault handlers.
I want ask some more questions:
- when allocate memory from user space it is possible to force the kernel
  to create a new vm_struct for newly allocated memory
- and it is possible to set user functions to page fault handlers of user pages
                            ^^^^
regards
