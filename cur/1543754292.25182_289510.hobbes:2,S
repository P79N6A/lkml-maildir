It is great that this is fixed, don't remove it, but it does require the fuse
libs to be updated at the same time, or opening dirs for listings will break
like this:
open(".", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY) = -1 ENOSYS (Function
not implemented)
As I personally like for my ls to keep on working, and I assume others will,
too, I would appreciate it if you could add a warning to your announcements the
following one or two weeks or so, so that people can remove this patch if they
don't want to update their libs.
Thank you.
