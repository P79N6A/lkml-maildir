Well, it depends on how you define "better".
In this particular scenario, the maps read as follows:
tools
-fstype=nfs,udp,rw,intr,nosuid,nodev,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,mountvers=3,nfsve
rs=3,actimeo=600 fs1.domain.com:/a/tools
share
-fstype=nfs,udp,rw,intr,nosuid,nodev,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,mountvers=3,nfsve
rs=3 fs1.domain.com:/a/share
The only difference is in the actimeo (I don't even know what it means). Is
this enough to fail a mount?
More importantly, it is a regression. My understanding is that unless
absolutely necessary we do not introduce a "feature" that breaks working
setups.

Unfortunately, as I said, I don't control the auto.auto nis map.

I guess the question is what should be the default.
I'll convey this to our system admin (fortunately we are not a very big
company), but I am just not 100% sure this is a well-thought change because
I believe many people will be impacted once 2.6.23 is out. Shouldn't we give
some time to user to fix their config before we enforce this, by like some
kernel warnings?
Thanks.
