Some pages could charged to the wrong container. Apart from that I do not
see anything going bad (I'll double check that).

We took a snapshot that we thought was consistent. We check for the value
outside. I guess there is no harm, the worst thing that could happen
is wrong accounting during mm->container changes (when a task changes
container).

Yes, thanks for keeping us humble and honest, I'll add it.
