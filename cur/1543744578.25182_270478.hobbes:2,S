I don't think it is the same problem.

-38 is -ENOSYS which means "Function not implemented"
(see include/asm-generic/errno.h in the kernel sources).
To support USB 1.1 devices over a 2.0 hub the hub contains
a so-called transaction translator that needs special support
in the USB driver, and which works differently for isochronous
transfers (note the isoc in the error message).
This is usually implemented after the other transfer types.

I don't think you can cure it with a different 2.0 hub.
You can either use only 1.1 hubs on the path to the device,
like with the keyboard, or try a newer kernel version
(but then 2.6.9 is already rather new).
Hope this helps
Jürgen
