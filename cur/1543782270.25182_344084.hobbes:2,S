It seems to have helped a little. Now the rate at which load average 
goes up has decreased ( I can copy up to about 700-800 MiB compared to a 
high of 200MiB earlier), but it is still going up to 15 gradually at 
which point I am still killing the cp process to make the system usable.
I know I am not giving much information. But if I know what factors 
cause the loadavg to keep on going up I will gladly provide it.
I am running  2.6.12 kernel on a laptop. I have an ipod attached to my 
USB 1.1 as a drive on which I am saving and retreiving large 
files(2-4GiB files). The transfer speed is slow, but I am fine with it, 
as long as the load average stays within bounds so that the machine is 
usable. (If I dual boot to windows and do the same operation, I am able 
to get the files copied over in a few minutes.). Can vfat be a factor?
Thanks
Rajesh
