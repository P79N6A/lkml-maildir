I never noticed it before either. Just do find | grep modalias in /sys
and see that every driver has a modalias attribute. It is probably
implement in drivers/base.

For this system my i2c device names are:
0-0050  0-0051  0-0052  0-0053
How does the name=eeprom attribute interact with this? All four of my
devices have name=eeprom. What is the name field used for in user
space?
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0052$ ls
driver  eeprom  modalias  name  power  subsystem  uevent
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0052$ cat name
eeprom
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0052$ ls driver -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2008-01-13 12:46 driver ->
../../../../../../bus/i2c/drivers/eeprom
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0052$
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/drivers$ ls
eeprom
jonsmirl@terra:/sys/bus/i2c/drivers$ ls eeprom
0-0050  0-0051  0-0052  0-0053  bind  module  uevent  unbind
