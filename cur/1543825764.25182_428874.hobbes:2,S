I think more needs to be said about the fairness issue.
1. If a task is getting its cap or more then it's getting its fair share 
as specified by that cap.  Yes?
2. If a task is getting less CPU usage then its cap then it will be 
being scheduled just as if it had no cap and will be getting its fair 
share just as much as any task is.
So there is no fairness problem.

I tend to test by observing the results of setting caps on running tasks 
and this doesn't generate something that can be e-mailed.
Observations indicate that hard caps are enforced to less than 1% and 
ditto for soft caps except for small soft caps where the fact (stated in 
the patches) that enforcement is not fully strict in order to prevent 
priority inversion or starvation means that the cap is generally 
exceeded.  I'm currently making modifications (based on suggestions by 
Con Kolivas) that implement an alternative method for avoiding priority 
inversion and starvation and allow the enforcement to be more strict.
