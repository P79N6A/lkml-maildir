It looks to me like alloc_large_system_hash() could also be called at
some later point and it may even invoke __vmalloc() if hashdist is set.
So I would prefer not to introduce another hook and additional if's to
know which one to call. BTW, I think the callback should actually be (to
avoid duplicating the vmalloc call, with proper comment):
	if (!hashdist)
		memleak_alloc(table, size, 1, GFP_ATOMIC);
