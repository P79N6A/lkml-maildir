Some of this discussion's getting a little X-Files-y.
However, there are some points I'd like to touch on...

This goes to the special nature of the Global Lock. If we cannot acquire it,
we set a bit, and the system interrupts when it is released. Please see
acpi_ev_acquire_global_lock().

You are most likely right about all this stuff. Haven't had the need to fix
it because it's been working fine. Patches accepted.

All we do at interrupt level is signal the semaphore that threads needing
the GL have blocked on. They continue execution at non-interrupt level.

We're aware of this issue and have coded accordingly. We have run into these
issues (specifically with the Embedded Controller driver) and we fix them
when they crop up.

What is your source for this? They certainly could have said that, but
everything I've heard is that MS was so committed to ACPI, they almost left
APM support out of W2K.

(I know I'm replying to Jeff's point in your email, sorry)
1) Vendors can write code that is *interpreted* by the OS.
2) If vendors write a malicious BIOS, it's game over even without ACPI
3) ACPI increases visibility of vendor code. You can disassemble AML. You
can step through it with our debugger.

You're kidding.........right?
BTW of course ACPI can be turned off via make menuconfig.

And from what I understand, Itanium doesn't necessarily have a Global Lock
either. Great, no problem. However, we still need to handle machines that
do.
