Well, for this specific case, I'd suggest you check out how much of the
write out actually happens in context of that process. Often you end up
with pdflush(es) doing the process dirty work, and the io priorities
aren't inherited across that boundary.

You need to be careful, on archs with HZ == 100 you just set every time
slice to 0.

I think it's pointless to scale it so fine grained (see my earlier
postings).
Additionally, you don't do anything with the priorities internally.
