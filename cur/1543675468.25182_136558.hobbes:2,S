Hi
I am trying to write a driver on linux-2.4.19. My hardware requires that
the packets going out should be VLAN tagged and coming in might/might not
have a tag. I have written a new hard_header function for this and set the
hard_header_len to ETH_HLEN+VLAN_HLEN. But, when a packet is received
without a tag, the eth_type_trans function is removing the first
ETH_HLEN+VLAN_HLEN bytes, as the hard_header_len is this much. so, the
packets are not being understood by the upper layers properly.
I changed the eth_type_trans function code as follows:
	if the device is my device
	        skb_pull(skb,ETH_HLEN);
	else
	        skb_pull(skb,dev->hard_header_len);
Could anyone tell me if it is going to affect any other functionality?
Could someone suggest some cleaner solution for my problem?
Thanks & regards
Madhavi.
