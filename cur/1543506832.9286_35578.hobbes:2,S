no, it's just that the RAID code has been around during all those buffer.c
rewrites, and it tried to be very careful and overparanoid. It might not
be necessery anymore.

i think you have not understood in what context that code is used. take a
look at buffer_lowprio() and how the BH_LowPrio bit lives.

this is an old comment, just ignore it. (there is no bforget in
cache_drop_behind anymore)

in RAID there can be a set_blocksize() called while the device has active
bhs. This never happens with a 'simple device'. I know it is hacky, but
the 'users' of the bhs that get their device's size changed under them are
also aware of this and thus the thing is safe.
