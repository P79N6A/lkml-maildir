here is an excerpt:
[root@linuz11 root]# mount -t container -ocpuset cpuset /containers/
[root@linuz11 root]# ls /containers/
cpu_exclusive   memory_pressure          mems               tasks
cpus            memory_pressure_enabled  notify_on_release
mem_exclusive   memory_spread_page       releasable
memory_migrate  memory_spread_slab       release_agent
[root@linuz11 root]# mkdir /containers/1
[root@linuz11 root]# echo 0 > /containers/1/mems
[root@linuz11 root]# echo 0 > /containers/1/cpus
[root@linuz11 root]# sh
sh-2.05b# echo $$ > /containers/1/tasks

Ah, I see the second time I typed 'ls /containers/1/tasks' instead of
cat.  When I then used cat, the file was empty, and I got an oops just
like Pavel reported.  I bet if I solve the problem he reported, then I
solve my problem  :)
thanks,
