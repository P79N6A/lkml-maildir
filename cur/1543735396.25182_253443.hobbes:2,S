I'm very glad to see numerical proof that /proc is crap.
If nproc does nothing else, it's still been useful.
The funny varargs/vsprintf/whatever encoding is useless to me,
as are the labels.
The nicest think about netlink is, i think, that it might make
a practical interface for incremental update. As processes run
or get modified, monitoring apps might get notified. I did not
see mention of this being implemented, and I would take quite 
some time to support it, so it's a long-term goal. (of course,
people can always submit procps patches to support this)
I doubt that it is good to break down the data into so many
different items. It seems sensible to break down the data by 
locking requirements. 
I could use an opaque per-process cookie for process identification.
This would protect from PID reuse, and might allow for faster
lookup. Perhaps it contains: PID, address of task_struct, and the
system-wide or per-cpu fork count from process creation.
Something like the stat() syscall would be pretty decent.
Well, whatever... In any case, I'd need to see some working code
for the libproc library. My net connection dies for hours at a
time, so don't expect speedy anything right now.
BTW, I have a 32-bit big-endian system with char being unsigned
by default. The varargs stuff is odd too.
