keep in mind that only around half of the seek time is because of the 
partition! Taking an IBM 120GXP as an example:
Average seek:				8.5ms
Full stroke seek:			15.0ms
Time to rotate disk one round:	1/(7200/60)*1000 = 8.3ms
Then, the sector you're looking for, will, by average, be half a round 
away from where you are, and thus, giving the minimum average seek time 
8.3/2 = 4.15ms or something like half the seek time. Concidering this, 
you may gain a maximum <= 50% gain in using smaller partitions.
btw. anyone that knows the zone layout on IBM drives?
