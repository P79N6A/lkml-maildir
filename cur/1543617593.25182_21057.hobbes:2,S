Sorry, but in my opinion Rik's rmap VM still beats your VM under IO
load. My benchmark is very simple: import a kernel tree into a CVS tree
that already contains about 470 other kernel trees. Both the import
directory and the CVS root are on the same disk. With 2.4.17 the mp3
player stutters, I can't even read email or edit a couple of files with
XEmacs at the same time. With 2.4.17-rmap-11a the mp3 player runs
smoothly and email and XEmacs are usable again.
Some time ago Linus made the important observation that we shouldn't
tune the scheduler for SMP systems simply because 99.9% of the systems
in the world running linux have a single CPU. IMHO an equally well
observation would be that we shouldn't tune the VM for the 0.1% of the
systems in this world that run large DMBSes. The 99.9% majority is much
more important.
Just my 0.02.
