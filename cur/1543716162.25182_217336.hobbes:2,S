Just to throw in my two cents at the end of this long debate... :-)
I heartily endorse (for what little that is worth ;-) the change in 
text. It adds clarity, it provides more information as to where to go 
for information. It is hard to misconstrue as a message of impending 
doom, consider that a good synonym for tainted is corrupted, and a 
corrupted kernel is a bad thing :-).
Cheers,
Paul
