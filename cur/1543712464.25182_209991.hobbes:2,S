This involves the interaction of three:  blkdev layer, IO scheduler, and VM.
VM:  initiates most of the writeback, and is often the main initiator of 
large requests.  The VM thresholds also serve to keep request size 
manageable.  See e.g.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108043321326801&w=2
IO scheduler:  the place to make the decision about whether the request 
latency is meeting expectations, etc.  It should be straightforward to 
use a windowing algorithm to slowly increase the request size until (a) 
latency limits are reached, (b) hardware limits are reached, or (c) VM 
thresholds are reached.
Ultimately there must be some -global- management of I/O, otherwise VM 
cannot survive, e.g. 128k requests on 1000 disks :)

Yes, I agree.
My point is there are two maximums:
1) the hardware limit
2) the limit that "makes sense", e.g. 512k or 1M for most
The driver should only care about #1, and should be "told" #2.
A very, very, very minimal implementation could be this:

Hardcoding such a maximum in the driver is inflexible and IMO incorrect.

32M is probably too large, but 1M is probably too small for:
a RAID array with 33 disks, that presents itself as a single SATA disk.
solid-state storage:  battery-backed RAM.
These things like bigger requests, and were designed to solve a lot of 
the latency problems in hardware.

Yes, agreed.
My main goal is to -not- worry about this in the low-level driver.   If 
you and Jens think 1M requests are maximum for disks, then put that in 
the _blkdev_ layer not my driver :)
Long term, I would like to see something like
