Does this explain why my SMP box does not boot with rmap12 ? It works fine
with rmap11c.
Machine: 4x  500MHz Pentium Pro with 3GB RAM
When I tried to boot 2.4.17+rmap12, last message I see is
uncompressing linux ...
booting ..
Thanks,
Badari

     - use fast pte quicklists on non-pae machines           (Andrea
Arcangeli)
Does this work on SMP?  I remember they were turned off because
they were simply broken on SMP.
The problem is that when vmalloc() or whatever kernel mappings change
you have to update all the quicklist page tables to match.
Andrea probably fixed this, I haven't looked at the patch.
If so, ignoreme.
