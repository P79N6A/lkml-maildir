This is a known problem, here is the discussion that I initiated
on linux-usb-devel:
 http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=98609508500001&w=2&r=1
The right fix is to comment that printout out.
In fact, that is what I commited for Red Hat 7.1 release.
Some people suggest to switch to uhci instead of usb-uhci,
which helps precisely because it does not have a corresponding
printk.
