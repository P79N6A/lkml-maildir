Greetings,
I need to access some ext3 and nfs file system
symbols from a new file system module we are 
developing. For example, the nfs_file_inode_operations
and ext3_dir_inode_operations. What functions 
or mechanism in the kernel are available for 
doing that? Any suggestions and advice is 
appreciated.
John W.
