Hi,
Whenever I compiled unloadable module support into my 2.6.15-r1 kernel, my kernel panic's when booting up when it tries to load a module for the first time.
I had this problem back with the 2.6.14 kernel, but figured it may have been solved since then so I tried it... and still fails.
Unloadable module support would be very helpful to me.
I am using an intel p4 3.0ghz with SMP support built into the kernel.
Please CC me in your responses.
Thanks!
George
