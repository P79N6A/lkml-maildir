your dongle looks like a Broadcom based dongle. Please include the part
from /proc/bus/usb/devices matching your device. The main problem is
that the mini driver and the firmware for the Broadcom dongle can't be
loaded throught request_firmware() by the bcm203x driver. Check the
BlueZ webpage for more details and put these files in the correct place.

Marcel
