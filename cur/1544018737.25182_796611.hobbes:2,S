We changed userspace-visible behaviour and broke real applications. 
This is a serious matter.  So serious in fact that your report has
languished without reply for a week.
Reverting those changes until we have a suitable reimplementation which
doesn't bust userspace is 100% justifiable.
In which kernel versions is this regression present?
What would a revert look like?  Big and ugly or small and simple?  Do
the original commits (which were they?) still revert OK?

Yes, that is a bit gross.
Does this patch actually 100% solve the problem, or is it a precursor
to some other fix or what?  It's hard to comment sensibly if it's a
partial thing with no sign how it will be used.

Well yes, that's a userspace-visible wrong change too.

-EWONTCOMPILE, btw.
