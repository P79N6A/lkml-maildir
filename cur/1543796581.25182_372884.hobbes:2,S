Hello guys,
I have the following problem: if connected directly to my computer's
USB ports, my webcam works correctly, but when connected through my
'AirVast' hub (124a:168b), it fails. The device is reported by lsusb
(IDs correct), but it does not work. The worst is: I have tried using
some proprietary OS, and it all worked there.
There are two possibilities (did I miss one?) I guess: either libusb
is playing, or the kernel USB stack is.
Now, rather than giving work to others, I don't mind trying to find
the problem myself, but I would appreciate a pointer to how to debug
such a problem... Tools? Compilation options?
Cheers,
Hervé.
