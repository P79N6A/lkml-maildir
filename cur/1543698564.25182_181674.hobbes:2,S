This explanation sounds a bit like "that mess is too fragile, there is
no way to touch it without everything falling apart."  Just one more
reason to change it and make it more maintainable.  I agree, it is a
big piece of work waiting for 2.7 to open up, but your only excuse not
to do it eventually is lack of time. ;)

Sounds like a valid candidate for <list.h>, but if you can prove the
list to always be short, it is ok.
