Confirmed as a sporadic hardware issue.  I took my machine in to a dealer to 
get checked out, by the time it got there it couldn't boot linux at all.   
After instaling a new motherboard, with faster memory and CPU upgrades, I 
haven't had any problem with Linux crashing at all.
My ISP choose that particular instant to go down, so it took a while to get 
back on this.   Thanks to everyone for pointing me in the right direction.
