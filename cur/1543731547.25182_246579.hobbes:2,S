I just upgraded two of my boxes here to 2.6.9-rc1 pulled from BitKeeper 
a few hours ago. One of them is my NFS server, using the kernel NFS 
daemon and serving XFS filesystems. The other is an NFS root client, 
using the kernel's autoconfiguration and NFS root mounting (using all 
default mount options).
After booting the NFS client, I had very strange behavior when creating 
symlinks on the NFS root if the link target path began with '.'. Just 
this sequence:
# mkdir foo
# cd foo
# ln -sf . test1
# ln -sf . test2
...
Would result in a successfully created link but an error message from ln 
reporting "stale NFS file handle".
Switching the NFS root client's mount to v3 from v2 seems to have 
avoided the problem.
