I'm certaily _not_ going to complain that code has been taken from
Linux - as you pointed out, that is perfectly legal.
The use of the Linux drivers in the Hurd is the closest thing[1] we've
got to a fork[2] of the Linux kernel.
So, yes, I am interested in seeing if they have done anything better
than we have, or have investigated possibilities we haven't.
John.
[1] I am _NOT_ saying that the Hurd is a fork of Linux, but that it's
about the only codebase which took Linux kernel code, and has let it
evolve separately from mainline over a number of years.  OK, the Vax
port has lived outside of mainline for a number of years too, but
that's mainly architecture specific changes.
[2] OK, ELKS is a fork of the Linux kernel, but not specifically
targeted at 386+ boxes.
John.
