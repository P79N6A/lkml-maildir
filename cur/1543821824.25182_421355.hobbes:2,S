I don't agree with your analysis at all. Quite the opposite in fact. I'm
amazed that Chris & Greg manage to update so often. Right now, you can be
confident that there's always an *official* kernel version which fixes a
few days-old vulnerability. I'd like to be that fast to provide 2.4 hotfixes
(I still have one fix pending).
The enormous advantage of releasing lots of small updates is that people
just have to choose when they want to update. If you're not affected by
the SMB vulnerability, don't upgrade. That's that simple. It makes it
much easier to class bug reports (eg: the last one on speedstep which
"appeared" in 2.6.16.13 and not 2.6.16.12 while no such code has changed).
Sometimes, a config option will have changed on the user side, or a gcc
update will have been performed which might explain a new bug which we
can be certain does not come from the source.
What might be interesting with this release cycle would be to work on
hot-patching. There has already been such things in the past with modules
which patched some functions. It would avoid a full compile and a reboot
in some circumstances.
That said, kudos to Chris and Greg for their excellent work ! Please
don't change.
