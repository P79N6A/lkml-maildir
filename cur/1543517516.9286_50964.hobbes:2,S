	OSF-Institute (or whatever the name is) did something like
	that a while ago.  They ported Linux over MACH-kernel.
	With MACH, kernel isn't a monolith, e.g. hard device IO can
	be its own subserver which is called via RPC calls from other
	(sub)servers.  All of which are running outside the innermost
	kernel protection ring.
	Depending what the profets told you about MACH-like paradigms,
	kernel services either are in "user process", or are somewhat
	special case...
	I recall they ran the resulting system on HP-PA hardware, and
	did observe about 5-10 % performance penalty against then current
	monolithic HP-UX.
	Another change of doing things is  VMWARE (www.vmware.com), which
	allows you running arbitary (pretty much) guest operating systems
	on top of i586+ virtualization facilities.
	(You *can* run Linux at such virtual box, but usually it is used
	 to run e.g. some Windows in that box.  Reminds me very much of
	 IBM VM/SP (Virtual Machine/System Product) at S/370 type hardware.)
