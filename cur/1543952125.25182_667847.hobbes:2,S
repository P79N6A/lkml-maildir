Kamalesh, thanks for reporting the problem.

It's in the Greg's tree actually.

Well, Greg please drop the "PM: make wakeup flags available whenever CONFIG_PM
is set" and Alan please resubmit the patch with the problems pointed out by
Andrew fixed.
In fact I'd even prefer it to be two patches, one that moves should_wakeup and
the related macros out of the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP #ifdef, because that's what fixes
the problem described in the changelog, and one that makes the remaining
changes with a separate changelog.
Thanks,
Rafael
