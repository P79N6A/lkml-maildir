First, I would recommend posting such queries to the linuxppc lists  
(linuxppc-dev@ozlabs.org, linuxppc-embedded@ozlabs.org).
Second, I'm no longer at Freescale so please email me at this address.
Ok, now to your question.  In general if a given board port touch  
files in arch/ppc/platforms/* than all of that code should be in one  
patch.  If you are touching anything in drivers/* you need to  
separate out those patches and send them to the respective driver  
maintainers.  If you want to provide a more detailed list of changes  
for 8540/8541 I can provide better directions on how to submit patches.
What boot loader are you using for your boards?  I ask because for  
the 85xx and 83xx subarchitectures I'm trying to limit new board  
ports in arch/ppc as we try to transition to arch/powerpc.  However,  
this requires that the firmware provide a flatten device tree to the  
kernel.
Hopefully that gets you a sense and feel free to ask any other  
questions.
