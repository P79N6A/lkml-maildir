The reasoning here is that it's much cheaper to go to a single block
which is very nearby than to be forced to use that single block later
on as part of some distant file once the disk becomes fuller.  It's a
sort of opportunistic fragmentation: if we can sneak in a disk
allocation that uses the awkward block without requiring a seek (and
in all likelihood coming out of the track buffer), then we reduce the
overall impact on performance of that isolated free block.

I've thought about that but today we're usually allocating in 4k
chunks rather than 1k so it's normally a 32k preallocation which we
get, anyway.
Cheers,
 Stephen
