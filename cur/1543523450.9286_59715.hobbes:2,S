My apologies to the group for sending the previous email regarding "Re:
Senior Unix Kernel Developer Job Opportunity"                         
This wont happen again.
For those who indicated their interest, Yes, I will provide more
detailed information. 
Many thanks to those who politely pointed me in the right direction.
