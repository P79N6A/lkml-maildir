Works for me with your .config fragment.  It could be a menu order
dependency, save .config, make oldconfig, compare the saved and new
.config.  If they are different then it was a menuconfig order
problem[*], if they are the same then I need your full .config, not
just an extract.
[*] A good reason to use CML2 ;)
