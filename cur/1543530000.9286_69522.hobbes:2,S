As long as I know it, scsi-idle has undergone what I call hot potatoe
maintainance: the first who got annoyed that it didn't work with a new
kernel tweaked it until it worked again and that was it. The core code
hasn't changed for ages.

Can you go see if noflushd works for you? The very latest is version 1.8.3
in 
http://www.tuebingen.linux.de/kobras/noflushd/testing/.
 The tarball has
a directroy contrib/ where you'll find a small kernel patch to 2.2.13 that
works for 2.2.14 as well. But also have a look at the caveats in the
accompanying README! This patch is the essence of scsi-idle with
all its downsides: it's not SMP-safe and rumour has very vage reports of
scsi-idle wrecking data. From a safety point of view, noflushd w/scsi is
no better or worse than the original scsi-idle. It worked for most people
but be warned. Thanks to Eric Youngdale I hope to come up with a better
patch for 2.4 one day, but this is currently preemted by other (paid ;-)
tasks for the moment. 
Regards,
Daniel.
