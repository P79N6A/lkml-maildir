    Jeff Garzik had the code to do this, and the new shared memory code should
    be able to be massaged to handle this all without actually bloating the
    kernel (ie "ramfs" would still stay very very tiny, just taking advantage
    of the common code that the VM layer already has to support for other
    things).
I would prefer we leave ramfs alone as is -- it makes an excellent
starting point for a new fs and is fairly simple to grok. If we are
to add any more complexity here like the size limiting patches or the
use of a backing store, I'd like to have this as a new filesystem,
something like 'vmfs' or some such.
ramfs is small simple and elegant; for mere mortals like me it
contains enough to help understand what is required of a filesystem
without obscuring this fact. I'd hate to see that change.
Jeff (or indeed anyone); if you have the patch Linus is talking about
somewhere (even and old one) could you sen it my way please (off the
list).
