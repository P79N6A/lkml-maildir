Copying linux-mm might have helped.  Bad time of year, too.
From the traces it looks like all IO has stopped and everyone is waiting
(directly or indirectly) for certain IO completions.  Is that really true,
or is IO still dribbling along?
From the kswapd0 trace it would appear that UDF is doing synchronous writes
(udf_update_inode->sync_dirty_buffer) which perhaps is making things
mightily slow.
