Any other errors in the logs?
Reading the code these errors appear after we put IO request
and then watitng for it to be complete with wait_on_buffer().
But after wait_on_buffer returns, bufer is still not up to date,
which usually means IO request have failed for some reason.

Yes, because there was an Oops after this message.

Right now it looks more like a HW problem.
Can you dig more messages from your kernel log.
Can you try to run reiserfsck on a problematic partition and see
if there is anything wrong?
