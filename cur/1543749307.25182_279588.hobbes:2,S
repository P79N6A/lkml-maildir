-Dnew=_New, problem solved.
I'm not in any way advocating compiling with g++ exclusively, but it 
would be nice to be *able to* for bugchecking.  It would be an 
interesting experiment, of nothing else.  I suspect it'd require some 
minor code tweaks and turn up a small handful of bugs right off the bat.
