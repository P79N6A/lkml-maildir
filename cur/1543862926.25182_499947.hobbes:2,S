No.  As I say, they're placed in the BSS.  The BSS is zeroed as part of
the C runtime initialisation.
If you want to place a variable in a specific section, it must be
explicitly initialised.  Eg,
static char __initdata command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE] = "";
However, there is a bigger question here: that is the tradeoff between
making this variable part of the on-disk kernel image, but throw away
the memory at runtime, or to leave it in the BSS where it will not be
part of the on-disk kernel image, but will not be thrown away at
runtime.
