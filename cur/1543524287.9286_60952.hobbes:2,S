Subject: modprobe hangs?

i'm running 2.3.41 on an asus K7M w/ an athlon 500.
For some reason, modprobe hangs for an absurdly long time when loading
modules.  The particular modules i'm using are bttv, tuner, and
msp3400.  At first i thought modprobe was failing, but after a while it
loads just fine.
This problem was not present in 2.3.40.
Any suggestions?
