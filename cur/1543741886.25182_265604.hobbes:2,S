Hi,
The people from the OpenBSD project are currently lobbying to get the
firmware for Intel wireless chipsets under a license suitable for Open
Source.
Since this will not only benefit BSD but also the Linux Project (and
even Intel) I would like to mention the URL here for people who want to
help writing to Intel.
