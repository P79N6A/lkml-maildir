Funny that you mention it. I actually noticed this too while working on this, 
but noticed that it is wrong everywhere (as in even plain sys_write/read gets 
it wrong). So I decided to not address it because it is already
broken. 
I did actually send email to a few people about this, but no answer
yet.
I agree it's probably all broken on 32bit platforms, but I'm not
sure how to best address this. When it is comprehensively addressed remote_llseek 
can use that new method too.
