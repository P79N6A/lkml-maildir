P6 architecture (PPro, PII etc.) introduce speculative execution, i.e. if
you for example try to "profile" fdiv by putting a couple of rdtsc before
and after you will be told that fdiv took 0 cycles which is obviously not
true (I wish it was :). This happens because the processor decides that
the second rdtsc is independent from the fdiv and executes it first. So,
one needs to serialize it somehow and the easiest way I know of doing it
is cpuid (but one needs to remember that it clobbers registers).

It is just for serializing, not to get any cpu features.

The first "care" you mean "don't care"? So I am not the only human being
who switches "yes/no", "do/don't".... Good.
Btw, __volatile__ in get_cycles() did go into 2.2.5. And the
justification, I hope, is that by doing so it can be used later on for
some other purpose. Putting __volatile__ does not make the current usage
of get_cycles() any worse so why not, if it gives you extra choice?
I personally use it to count the number of cycles it takes for a
particular code path (i.e. without having to enable profiling globally). I
know it is not very accurate (without the usual triple cache warmup
thingy and deducting overheads etc) but it *can* be used to compare one
instruction sequence with another.
There is a Intel's paper on this on developer.intel.com called something
like "Using RDTSC for Performance Monitoring" (not exactly, can't remember
the exact name).
Regards,
Tigran.
