Ok, what is supposed to happen here is that filesystems are supposed to
be throttled from making more dirty pages when the system is over the
threshold.  Even if filesystem A doesn't have much to contribute, and
filesystem B is the cause of 99% of the dirty pages, the goal of the
threshold is to prevent more dirty data from happening, and filesystem A
should block.
But, with the producer consumer setup of fuse, I think this is a pretty
good compromise.  16 dirty/writeback pages shouldn't hurt the overall
limits too badly.
