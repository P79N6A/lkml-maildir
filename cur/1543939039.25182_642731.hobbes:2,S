The effects become bigger when you realize that there are many such 
places in the kernel.
And the benefit of keeping it is zero.
Even in the hypothetical case that someone would use it, he could simply 
re-add it.

What you are doing is not contributing but wasting other people's time.
The only thing you could ever achieve with this kind of "contribution" 
is to end up in some killfiles.

AFAIK the kernel never shipped with iBCS2 support.
Which kernels under 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v
*.*/ fulfill 
your claim?

The point is that ideas do not turn themselves into code.
And there are far too many people who want to see their great ideas 
implemented without implementing it themselves.
Talking about a feature without having anyone willing to implement it 
simply has no value.
