I think that this:
config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	---help---
	This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	The driver supports both read as well as write commands.
should not be in lib/Kconfig.  lib/ is not for drivers.
or (simpler) s/driver/library/
but I think I'd rather see it in drivers/misc/.
and the help text needs to be indented 2 more spaces...
