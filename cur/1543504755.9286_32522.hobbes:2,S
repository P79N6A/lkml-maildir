Cool. Your solution beat my complicated proposal with its simplicity
and elegance by large. Looks fine for me.
Automatic init order computation with symbols at compile time wasn't that 
great a idea anyways, if I think deeper about it (because the C namespace is 
flat, and with facts like isdn4linux declaring "dev" as a global variable it
could have lead to some problems) 
So letting a human handle that via the Makefile is probably safer.
