Hi,
I'm currently playing around with the security/root_plug.c LSM module 
and I have two questions:
1) What's the recommended way of telling that someone is logging in to 
the computer (via ssh, virtual console, serial console, X, whatever) 
with LSM? Look for open() on /dev/pts?
2) root_plug currently scans the usb device tree looking for the 
appropriate device each time it's needed. In the interest of making the 
result of the lookup cached, it is possible for a module to register so 
that it is notified when a usb device is added/removed?
Regards,
David
