I haven't specifically tested, but I'd put good money on it being
a result of the initialization of cyc2ns_scale.  Before this
is set, cycles_2_ns() returns 0 (which would explain the _exactly_
0 value).  The value of 27.<something> seconds is very likely the
real value based on the TSC (which would mean the BIOS took
a good long time during boot).
So, in summary, this is probably what's happening:
 * from start_kernel - sched_clock() returns jiffies_64 (which
  is pre-initialized high and is not incrementing yet)
 * when use_tsc is set, sched_clock returns 0, until
 * when cyc2ns_scale is set, sched_clock returns TSC-based values,
  representing time from cold machine start
On other platforms, I have sometimes replaced the call to sched_clock()
in printk() with something else that gives valid data from the very first
kernel instruction.
A while ago Andrew Morton said that maybe the clock used here should be
replaceable, using something like the code below.  Does anyone know
if someone worked on this.  If not I'll take a stab at submitting it.
