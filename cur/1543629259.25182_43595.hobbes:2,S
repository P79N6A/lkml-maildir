There where no reaction becouse problems with the multi sector
IO code path in the driver are well known... and unfortunately still
not resolved becouse there are expected changes in the whole
handling of them. However to confirm this you could for the time
beeing please just try to displabe multi sector writes
on this driver by editing the following code in ide-disk.c
#ifdef CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE
		id->multsect = ((id->max_multsect/2) > 1) ? id->max_multsect : 0;
		id->multsect_valid = id->multsect ? 1 : 0;
		drive->mult_req = id->multsect_valid ? id->max_multsect : INITIAL_MULT_COUNT;
		if (drive->mult_req)
			drive->special_cmd |= ATA_SPECIAL_MMODE;
#else
		/* original, pre IDE-NFG, per request of AC */
		drive->mult_req = INITIAL_MULT_COUNT;
		if (drive->mult_req > id->max_multsect)
			drive->mult_req = id->max_multsect;
		if (drive->mult_req || ((id->multsect_valid & 1) && id->multsect))
			drive->special_cmd |= ATA_SPECIAL_MMODE;
#endif
to always set mult_req to 0.
Peerhaps you could of course check bfore hand first
if CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE is set and
INITIAL_MULT_COUNT allways equal to 0.
Thank you in advance.
