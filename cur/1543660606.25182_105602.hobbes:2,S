   I don't understand the issue, really. The config register says:
   "MSIs are enabled". Which means: "My platform is *really* going to
   use MSI". Why do you want to ignore that?
I see, why not code up a generic pci_using_msi(pdev) that
does this?
I suggested a per-arch version because I was not clear on how
this exactly worked.
