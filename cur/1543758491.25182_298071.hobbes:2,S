Yes, I'm aware.  It should read:
5.) adapt the Yenta driver to the new PCI bus class
:)

We can have default sizes allocated for these windows.  Maybe, we'll
even have rebalancing at some point.
As for BUS IDs, I'm not sure about the best behavior.  I don't really
like reserving 4 positions like we do now.  It has a tendency to create
conflicts, and seems to be unnecessary.  How common are PCI bridge
devices that attach to cardbus controllers?  Does the BIOS ever
preconfigure the cardbus bridge for this situation?  I think it's
important that we get bus numbering correct.  Some hardware has problems
now.

Yeah, also legacy resources can't pass through properly if the parent
bridge isn't transparent.  Complex bus topologies make the problem much
more difficult when legacy hardware is involved.
