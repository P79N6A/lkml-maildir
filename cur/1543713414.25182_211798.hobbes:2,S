Messages says lxdialog is bad, probably because of a problem
with ncurses
I have:
/lib/libncurses.so.5    -> libncurses.so.5.4
/lib/libncurses.so.5.4
/usr/lib/libncurses.a
/usr/lib/libncurses.so  -> /lib/libncurses.so.5
/usr/lib/libncurses.so.5   ->   libtermcap.so
/usr/include/ncurses.h   -> curses.h
/usr/include/ncurses_dll.h
/usr/include/curses.h
I don't see any other ncurses lib's or headers
System ia64 (zx2000) running Debian 2.4.19
trying to build 2.4.25 from debian kernel-source-2.4.25
    with kernel-patches-2.4.25-ia64
Also have
/lib/libc-2.3.2.so
/lib/libc.so.6.1  -> libc-2.3.2.so
I tried removing /usr/lib/libncurses.a as it is not part of the
ncurses5 package but did not make a difference
The message also suggests that you can rebuild lxdialog
by cd'ing to /usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog and
running make clean all
This will never work as HOSTGCC is not defined unless make
is run in /usr/src/linux
Iwould appreciate any help or suggestions.
