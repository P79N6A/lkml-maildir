Your patch does change sglist for any driver which sets DMA alignment.
You'll definitely need to audit more than libata.

With both patches applied, sglist and data_len are adjusted only for
libata, so only drivers which explicitly requested buffer size
manipulation (currently only libata) need to be audited / updated.
