Funny that you mention it, because I actually have a cunning plan, and
you're an unwitting part of it.
Or actually, I hope you're a "witting" part of it, because it's going to
be your code.
Take your "struct block_device" code, add a "struct address_space" to it,
and whenever a block device inode is opened, make the inode->i_mapping
point to &bdev->b_data, and voila..
You already get all the reference counting right, and it's the only
sensible place to do it anyway, wouldn't you agree?
I thought you'd be thrilled. It seems to match your lazy allocation patch
very well..
