I agree. Getting 420MB/s to the pci bus is nice, especially with a P3.  
The 800MB/s to memory was just the test I happened to conduct about 2 years
ago when I was still messing with slow P3 systems.  It was a proof of
concept test to see if we could plug in an I/O card into a memory
slot.  
On a current P4 system with the E7500 chipset this kind of thing is
easy.  I have gotten roughly 450MB/s to a single myrinet card.  And there 
is enough theoretical bandwidth to do 4 times that.  I haven't had a
chance to get it working in practice.  When I attempted to run to gige
cards simultaneously I had some weird problem (probably interrupt
related) where adding additional pci cards did not deliver any extra
performance.  
On a P3 to get writes from the cpu to hit 800MB/s you use the special
cpu instructions that bypass the cache.  
My point was that I have tested the P3 bus in question and I achieved
a real world 800MB/s over it.  So I expect that on the system in
question unless another bottleneck is hit, it should be possible to
achieve a real world 800MB/s of I/O.  There are enough pci busses
to support that kind of traffic.
Unless the memory controller is carefully placed on the system though
doing 400+MB/s could easily eat up most of the available memory
bandwidth and reduce the system to doing some very slow cache line fills.
