Looks like a -really- stupid idea to assign a normal user to UID 0 - just
to big a security hole with all those legacy programs floating around. Use
it for something special, like no user or something else instead. 0 IS a
special number, which can be easily tested against (if (!number) .. - I
know this is bad C, but you get my point...)
