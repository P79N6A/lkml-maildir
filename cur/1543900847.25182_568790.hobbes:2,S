Disabling NetLabel should solve the problem.  The recommended solution to this problem, as discussed on the SELinux list and mentioned in the patch description, is to upgrade your SELinux policy to the latest Reference Policy sources.  For those with custom SELinux policy, the patch description explains the changes to the SELinux policy required. 
If needed I can post more instructions later, let me know, but right now I'm tapping this out on my phone while at the airport.
