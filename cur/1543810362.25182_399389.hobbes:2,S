Argh! I mean to write this reply earlier...
As I said I like the patch overall, however I do not agree that BUG_ON is
appropriate here. Whatever issues with speaker device there is they do not
warrant OOPS at boot time. Speaker is not critical device so just clean up
after failure an move on. If you compare code cleaning up with code using
BUG_ON they are about the same in the end.
