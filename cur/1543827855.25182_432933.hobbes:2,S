Subject: [patch 6/24] s390: ccwgroup device unregister.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[S390] ccwgroup device unregister.
Work around the problem that a device cannot be unregistered from
driver_for_each_device() because of klist node refcounting: Get device
after device owned by the driver to be unregistered with driver_find_device()
and then unregister it. This works because driver_get_device() gets us out of
the region of the elevated klist node refcount. driver_find_device() will
always get the next device in the list after the found one has been
unregistered.
