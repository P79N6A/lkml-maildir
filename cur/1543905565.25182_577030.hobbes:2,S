Looking at the crash

I am not sure, I really understand whats happening here. It looks
like dio->map_bh.b_dev is junk. But looking at the code, we shouldn't
be in dio_send_cur_page() unless if we have a valid dio->cur_page.
(which means, that we added a page to submit, which also means
previous getblock() succeded, which means that we should have a
valid map_bh). What am I missing here ?
        if (dio->cur_page) {
                ret2 = dio_send_cur_page(dio);
                if (ret == 0)
                        ret = ret2;
                page_cache_release(dio->cur_page);
                dio->cur_page = NULL;
        }

Yeah. kzalloc() may be right way to go.. But I would like to understand
what exactly is happening here.
