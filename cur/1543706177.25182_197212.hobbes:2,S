The kgdb_schedule_breakpoint stuff in -mm didn't just appear to make
things more complicated, it is in fact necessary. You cannot
reasonably expect to break deep inside the network stack IRQ handler
and then send more packets out the same interface. Expect especially
nasty results on SMP. It only works for the serial case because that
path is a priori known to be lockless.
