I believe this is a false positive and I think I can see where it went
wrong.  The dependency between #0 and #1 is the broken premise.
The validator is probably putting all sk_lock's in the same basket.
That is, it's mixing up the socket locks for TCP, UDP as well as
AF_PACKET.  While it is true that TCP and UDP's sk_lock may sit
outside queue_lock, AF_PACKET never transmits while holding its
sk_lock.
So the #0 => #1 dependency shouldn't exist.  Can you get the validator
to print out the reasoning for the #0 => #1 dependency? That should
clarify the problem.
Cheers,
