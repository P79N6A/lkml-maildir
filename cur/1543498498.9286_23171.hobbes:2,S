I'm the one who originally raised the issue here, and I apologize to one
and all.  Several people castigated me in private email for posting the
message inappropriately to linux-kernel and were not happy that I
included long strace outputs with the message.  Rest assured it won't
happen again.  My only defense is that I first encountered the error it
was while running a 2.3.X kernel and it wasn't immediately obvious to me
where the problem was.
Nate Eldridge sent me a patch to xinit.c which cured the problem.
Unfortunately it had the side effect of disabling the ctrl-alt-Fn to
switch virtual consoles.  I'm looking into that now.  
I've learned my lesson.  Next time I'll make sure I have a valid kernel
issue before I post here.  If I figure out the ctrl-alt-Fn issue I'll
contact the appropriate list.  Thanks for your patience.
