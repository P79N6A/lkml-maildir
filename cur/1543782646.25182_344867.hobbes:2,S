With the third patch applied, it looks like this instead:
static inline int security_ptrace (struct task_struct * parent, struct task_struct * child)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY
        if (security_ops->ptrace)
                return security_ops->ptrace(parent, child);
#endif
        return cap_ptrace (parent, child);
}

Only matters if there are two or more modules that need to be used
together and both need to override/supplement the capability logic for a
given hook.

That makes capability part of the core kernel again, just like DAC,
which means that you can never override a capability denial in your
module.  We sometimes want to override the capability implementation,
not just apply further restrictions after it.  cap_inode_setxattr and
cap_inode_removexattr are examples; they prohibit any access to _all_
security attributes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN, whereas SELinux wants to
allow access to security.selinux if you pass a certain set of its own
permission checks.  vm_enough_memory is another problem area due to vm
accounting handled internally.

That one isn't so much an issue as the xattr ones and vm_enough_memory
case.  But more generally, if you think about moving toward a place
where one can grant privileges to processes based solely on their
role/domain, you'll need the same ability for capable and other hooks
too.  Naturally, that can't be done safely without a lot more work on
userspace and policy, but it is a long term goal.
