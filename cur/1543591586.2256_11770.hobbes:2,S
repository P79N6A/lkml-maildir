You are not. Think for a minute and you'll see why.
Linus' idea of /dev/tty/<parameters> is marginally sane - it makes sense
to consider that as configuring-upon-open. You _are_ going to do IO on
that file.
Ben's /dev/md0/<living_horror> is ugly - it's open just for side effects,
with no IO supposed to happen.
His idea of passing file descriptor instead of name makes these side effects
even messier.
The stuff you've proposed is a perversion worth of Albert. You've introduced
additional metacharacter into filenames, you will need some form of quoting
to be able to pass literal commas and you will need to quote slashes. It's
way past ugly.
