If you mean st_blksize, well:
       The value st_blocks gives the size of the file in 512-byte
       blocks.  The value st_blksize gives the "preferred" block­
       size for efficient file system I/O.  (Writing to a file in
       smaller  chunks  may  cause  an  inefficient  read-modify-
       rewrite.)
Telling programs 'please use 1-byte r/w buffers' is probably
a bad idea.
Mike.
