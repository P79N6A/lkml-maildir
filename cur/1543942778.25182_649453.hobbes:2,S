Just to keep this on track.  It sounds like his suspend/resume backport was
incomplete and something there is smashing the list sysctl_head_next follows.
This would both cause files to disappear, and an oops.
Possibly it isn't an incomplete backport but instead a memory smash that hits
different places in different kernels.
