Hi everyone,
This is dm-ioband version 0.0.3 release.
Dm-ioband is an I/O bandwidth controller implemented as a device-mapper driver,
which gives specified bandwidth to each job running on the same physical
device.
Changes since 0.0.2 (23rd January):
   - Ported to linux-2.6.24.
   - Rename the name of this device-mapper device as "ioband."
   - The output format of "dmsetup table" can be recognized by "dmsetup
     create/load/reload."
   - Add a new feature to block processes requesting BIOs in case the number
     of the uncompleted BIOs becomes too large.
   - Gid can be used as an ioband group type.
   - Support "dmsetup suspend --noflush."
   - Fix the problem that "dmsetup detach" doesn't wait the completion of
     all the BIOs in the detaching group.
   - Fix the problem that "dmsetup message attach" can't accept ID 0.
   - Code cleanups. Use prefix "dm_" for the global symbols.
   - Add examples in the document.
Thanks,
Ryo Tsuruta
