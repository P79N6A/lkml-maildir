Hi,
I'm using 2.4.24 on two different machines (laptop, via kt133a and desktop 
with nforce2 chipset). Both have IDE cd writers and I use hdc=scsi as boot 
parameter. The laptop works fine, but the desktop not:
# modprobe ide-scsi
hdc: attached ide-scsi driver.
hdc: DMA disabled
If I want to enable DMA with hdparm, I get this error:
/dev/hdc:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
Only if I remove the ide-scsi module, I can set DMA again, reloading 
ide-scsi disables dma.
I also tried echo using_dma:1 > /proc/ide/hdc/settings
It works fine without ide-scsi, but is stuck at 0 with ide-scsi (no 
errors in syslog).
All above things (hdparm, ...) work on the other machine, so it seems to 
be a problem with the nforce2 ide controller (brand-new Asus A7N8X-X 
board) and ide-scsi.
I don't use any GPL-conflicting modules (disabled onboard network and 
added a realtek card). Kernel compiler is gcc 3.3.1 from SuSE 9.0.
kind regards
Markus Gaugusch
