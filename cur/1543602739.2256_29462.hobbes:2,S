the HomePNA group has given me a binary driver for HPNA 2.0 Linksys
cards.
It is beta and can be found at:
lynx 
ftp://ftp.linksys.com/beta/linux_full_binary_2_33.exe
you can use Wine to extract it since its a windows setup executable
(LAME!)
perhaps we can dissasemble this module and build a non cluttered
driver? :-)
>From the readme.txt:
Linux Release 2_33
Linux network device driver for the Broadcom BCM42XX PCI
InsideLine 10Mbps Home Phoneline Networking chip.
This release includes:
- support for HPNA 2.0 Certification Testing
- MODVERSIONS support for Linux 2.2 and 2.4 Kernels.  These
modules have been compiled and tested with MODVERSIONS defined
on a RedHat 6.2 system with include files from the RedHat
2.2.14-5.0 kernel.  The driver for the 2.4 kernel uses the
2.4.0-test10 kernel distribution from ftp.kernel.org.
Note:  The kernels should be compiled with nonSMP
This distribution includes two il.o executables:
  - \Kernel_2.2.14-5.0\il.o ---> 62545 bytes (nonSMP)
  - \Kernel_2.4.0-Test10\il.o ---> 70695 bytes (nonSMP)
