Userspace is preemptable and schedulable, so it's inherently rate
limited.

No, I'm not assuming that level of naivete. My primary interest is that
the amount of work be properly rate limited, and running at fixed
intervals isn't quite enough; it needs to be bounded amounts of work at
fixed intervals. I failed to point this out, but something more
incremental than a NR_IRQS sweep across all IRQ's every 60s is needed
for proper rate limiting.

This is actually a more general concern about correctness. Any
in-kernel algorithm must rely on the in-kernel IO-APIC RTE formation
code, which is highly problematic at best, as partially described by
all of the confusions and incorrect declarations mentioned above. Even
the "Wal-Mart" SMP subarch, used for the most common of i386 machines,
incorrectly declares its physical broadcast destination to be non-xAPIC
physical broadcast despite being used for Pentium IV and prior cpus.
