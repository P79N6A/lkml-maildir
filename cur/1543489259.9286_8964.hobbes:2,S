In NFS you cannot delete a file that another process is holding open
as this would cause the file to physically disappear.  The standard
trick (on all UNIX NFS clients) is to rename the open file to some
unique and very unlikely name (typically .nfsxxxxx), and then to
postpone deleting it until it is closed. Since deleting such a file
makes no sense, it is not allowed.
Cheers,
