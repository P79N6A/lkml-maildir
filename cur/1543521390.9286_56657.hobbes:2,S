I really liked the patch at the first glance, too. But Alan is correct,
you can just append a very small initrd to the kernel which does
dhcp (or bootp) and then loads the real rootfs ramdisk via tftp into
ram1 - entirely in userspace. Yes, someone needs to do this very small
neat first-stage initrd, but it seems at least possible to me.
