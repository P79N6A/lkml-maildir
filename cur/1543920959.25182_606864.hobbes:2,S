perhaps because you are not running a CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y kernel?
I recently fixed DEBUG_PAGEALLOC (it would crash upon bootup on x86 most 
of the time on any real hardware - so i doubt people were able to use it 
all that much). As long as you try Linus' latest -git tree (which has 
the latest arch/x86 merge) and use the 32-bit x86 kernel it should work 
fine for you too, and you will probably be able to trigger similar 
crashes too.
