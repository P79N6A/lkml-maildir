Hi, I do not think that using blacklist in base driver for this purpose
is good idea. If so, we need modify source when each new HID device
driver come, that's so ugly. I think the blacklist only should be used
for those really broken/buggy hardware, not for these normal hardware
with extended feature.
Er, I also want to know what are drawbacks of "flip-flopping" ?

Well, many devices just only can not play its full feature, not broken.
so base driver still can work for us.
