Andrew wants a deprecation period for these symbols where the few users 
are most likely doing something wrong when using them, but if someone 
e.g. changes the IRQ API in a way that breaks most external modules no 
deprecation period is required.
If the kernel should get some module API stability processes like 
EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL() deprecation periods have to be made mandatory
for *all* API changes and removals.
But forcing EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL on me while allowing other people to do 
bigger API changes without deprecation periods is not a policy, it's a 
personal offence.
