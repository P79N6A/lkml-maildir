Except that "secure delete" should really be "secure truncate" anyway -
you don't want to abandon the bits on the disk just because someone
did a truncate(,0) just before the unlink().  So this doesn't
really help.
As for the idea of having a fast truncate for unlink() to use - that
sounds fine.  However, it ideally should be used for the common case
where truncate/ftruncate/O_TRUNC is used and noone else has the file.
Can't this be done by checking the in-kernel reference count assuming
we lock the inode for the duration?  Then we'd not only get the speed-up
on unlink, but also on most truncates.
Anyway, I'm no VFS whiz, so maybe I've got it all wrong.  Here's a free
grain of salt to go with that message: .
