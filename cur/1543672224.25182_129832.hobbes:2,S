Signal handlers have special significance on UNIX-like operating
systems.  An application might want to know when it's in a signal
frame.  If it's a problem to do this with DWARF2 info, fine.  If not,
please consider adding a marker (my current version of libunwind for
x86 does code-reading to detect signal-frames; not pretty, but it
works reasonable well in practice; it would be nicer to get rid of the
code-reading though, in the future).
