The proposed kernel signal delivery patch only handles the case
where the /sigframe/ ends up overlapping the end of the altstack.
If the sigframe remains within the altstack boundaries but the
user-space signal handler adds an /ordinary stack frame/ that
moves SP beyond the altstack limit, then the kernel patch solves
nothing and recursive signals will cause altstack wraparound.
On the other hand, the user-space technique of making the lowest
page(s) in the altstack inaccessible handles both cases of overflow.
