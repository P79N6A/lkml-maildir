There are other reasons for doing it, e.g. unusual TLB attributes
and/or unusual pagetable structures backing the virtual region. I don't
see anyone standing up and screaming for more functionality than cache
coherency and/or disablement now, so as far as I'm concerned,
remap_area_pages() (or rmk's stuff) kills the issue.
