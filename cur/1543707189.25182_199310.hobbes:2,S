It just goes back to treating them the same as physical CPUs.
The option will be eventually removed.

The biggest problems with SMT happen when 1 < Nproc < Nsibs,
because every two processes that end up on one physical CPU
leaves one physical CPU idle, and the non HT scheduler can't
detect or correct this.
At higher numbers of processes, you fill all virtual CPUs,
so physical CPUs don't become idle. You can still be smarter
about cache and migration costs though.

Not sure if they have any sort of HT aware scheduler or not.
If they do it is probably a shared runqueues type which is
much the same as sched domains in terms of functionality.
I don't think it would help much here though.
