I believe Ingo's RT patches already support this on a per-IRQ basis.
Each IRQ handler can run in a realtime thread with priority assigned
by the sysadmin.  Balancing the interrupt handler priorities with
those of other realtime activities allows excellent control.  
This is really only useful within the context of a dedicated realtime
system, of course.
Stephane Letz reports a similar feature in Mac OS X.

That's a price both groups pay for doing realtime within the context
of a general-purpose OS.  But, for many, many applications it's the
best option.
Fortunately, most of what we need also improves the general quality
and responsiveness of the kernel.  The important things like short
lock hold times are really just good concurrent programming practice.

Yes, many people want to take advantage of this.
