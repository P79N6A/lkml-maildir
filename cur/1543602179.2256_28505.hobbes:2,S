Decent write caching on IDE devices can eat your whole file system.
Turn it off (I have no idea of internals, but I presume it'll still be a
write-through cache, so reading back will still be served from the

One might consider adding TCQ to the IDE driver. FreeBSD already has it,
and IBM drives talk it.
