Hi Ingo,

I was answering to Adrian Bunk's email about missing defconfigs for the x86 
subarchitecture boards.

Apart from selecting the 486 instruction subset, everything else should be 
allright though I had the habit to have a stripped down kernel for testing.

The GPIO calls will be moving later when I have finished the gpiolib 
integration for RDC just like what is currently done for ARM. You are right 
for the watchdog driver, I will move it right now.
