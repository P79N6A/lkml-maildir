Let me try again :)
**resource management**
Non-ACPI platforms uses $HRT/EBDA, pcibios_*(), SMBIOS, etc. for slot
enumeration/configuration.
DIG64/ACPI, and SHPC requires ACPI for this. IPF platforms only have ACPI
_CRS, _PRT, _HPP, _BBN, _STA, _ADR, _SUN, etc on the namespace for PHP, and
we have to use them. (as a side note, this functionality is common for other
hotplug-* as mentioned in first mail. No API will be common for
hotplug-everything, but functionality is common and has not to be
duplicated)
**event management in terms of controller/slot operations **
ACPI provides only _EJ0, _PS?, _STA, etc for slot operations but these are
not mandatory. That means, we can use either ACPI method or controller
driver.
intcphp driver has not enabled ACPI method based solution but uses
controller driver.
intcphp driver is also capable of performing ACPI method based solution
since it works on ACPI namespace. This is why acpiphp and intcphp could be
sharing resource management and event management.

Well, I removed many dead codes from the base driver. This is not dead code
but needed to support other types.
However, if it's not acceptable, I'll remove them.

No intention like that at all. Please regard this as bright side of
engineers simple version control w/ commonly used #ifdefs :)
Anyway, they'll be removed per your requirement.

It's not my area to answer. It's product marketting. I do not want to skrew
marketting :)
We want the driver available before they compalint it :|
BTW, do we know how far is 2.6, even roughly ?

Ah. I now know why you are the one who talks about this :)
OK, then, I'll send you a patch against your cpqphp driver asap.
Thanks,
