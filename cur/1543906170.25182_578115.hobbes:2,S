The first volumes of the Intel and AMD architecture manuals are far from "raw
datasheets".  In fact they're quite well written as brief introduction
of x86 assuming you have some basic knowledge of assembly language concepts.
There might be better introductions for a total newbie but if you
already know another assembly language and other basic concepts
of computer architecture they should serve you very well.
