You "use" the Linux source code by feeding it to a compiler.  Or maybe
as a hideous fortune file.  The output of that compiler is *clearly* a
derived work, and thus bound by the GPL.
So far, I don't see any reason why a module that uses an inline function
provided via a kernel header could be distributed in binary format without 
being a "derived work" and thus bound by the GPL.

Compile it.
Run the resulting executable (ignoring the case law that says copying
into ram is a copy under copyright law)
Read the source code.
Write a module using the source code (i.e, via headers)
If you want to distribute that module, you must, of course, follow the
GPL.

You don't run source code.  Not even in Perl programs (though there, at
least, the distinction is more complicated.)
You compile source code.  The resultant object code is then run.

Repeat after me: The GPL is a copyright license.  It covers
distribution, not use.  Distribution of any part of the "work" is
covered.  Inline functions in headers are clearly part of the "work".
If you have a module that uses an inline function, there are two
options (note: not two legal options):
	Distribute source
	Distribute a binary
If you distribute a binary and refuse to provide the source under the GPL, 
ask yourself this: What gave you the right to distribute the
compiled form of the inline functions you use?
Note: My use of "inline functions" as a bludgeoning device should not be
interpreted as an acknowledgement that the rest of the header files
constitute a published "API".
