I was experiencing DMA trouble with 2.4.18 when using software RAID 0
on this motherboard. There was no problem when not using RAID
software, even when doing parallel transfer between two disks. The
problem disappeared with Alan Cox' 2.4.19-pre4-ac6 (not sure, will
check the version, but the problem still was here with
2.4.19-pre2-ac4).
There was no problem when using software RAID for the card (but
performances were poor). But definitly, it is still under heavy
development.
