I reread the 2.2 and 2.4 code:
2.2 spreads all vectors, even the internal interrupts (tlb flush,
reschedule, timer, call function) are spread.
Hmm. AFAICS there is one bug: 3 interrupts are in priority 5:
CALL_FUNCTION_VECTOR	0x50
IRQ0_TRAP_VECTOR	0x51
irq1: irq0+8		0x59
check arch/i386/kernel/irq.h and assign_irq_vector (io_apic.c)
2.4 spreads the vectors for the external (hardware, from io apic)
interrupts, but 5 ipi vectors have the same priority: reschedule, call
function, tlb invalidate, apic error, spurious interrupt.
But that doesn't explain what happens with ne2k cards: neither 2.2 nor
2.4 have more than 2 interrupts in class for the hardware interrupt
16/19.
With 2.2 I don't have any problems, 2.4 hangs.
