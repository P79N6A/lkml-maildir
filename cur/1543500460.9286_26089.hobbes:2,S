Hi!!!!!
Thanks for responding.  Details follow, but if more information would
help, please let me know!  Fwiw, with only minor differences I've had no
problem running plip with the 2.0.36 kernel, other than a bit of
transmit/receive timeout stumbling.
Graham
I am running:
Pentium 166 w/ 64MB RAM
Red Hat Linux 6.0
Kernel 2.2.10 with plip added as a module
Problem:
1.  When I run plip for the first time after a system boot, plip seems
to work fine, though I receive the following console message:
SIOCADDRT: No such device
2.  When I drop the plip connection, the plip module seems to stay
loaded.
2a. If I attempt to run plip for a second time, the link does not work.
2b. If I attempt to remove the plip module after plip is dropped for the
first time, I receive a screen full of groups of numbers, followed by:
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
and the machine reboots.
2c. If I attemt to remove the plip module after plip is dropped for the
second time, I receive a screen full of groups of numbers, including:
Code ff 0b 0f 94 c0 84 c0 74 1b 8b 43 08 50 e8 e6 7f 01 00 8b 43
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Following that, the machine is locked up and will only restart with a
manual reset of the hardware.
This error condition is repeatable.  This error was also present with a
similarly configured 2.2.9 kernel (source modified to correct DoS bug),
and was equally as repeatable.
I use the following script to bring up plip:
ifconfig plip0 -arp mtu 1500 128.1.1.1 pointopoint 128.1.1.2 up
route add 128.1.1.2
I use the following script to drop plip:
ifconfig plip0 down
