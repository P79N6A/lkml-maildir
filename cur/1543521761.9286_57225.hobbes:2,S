No, it is not possible.  Some different versioned
kernels may work with the same modules, most will not.
Also note that modules for a SMP kernel won't work with
a uniprocessor kernel and vice-versa, even if it is
exactly the same version number.  Kernels with and without
the 64GB memory setup also need different modules for the
same version.
Distributing kernel modules for a wide range of versions
is still possible though - by distributing source code.
If your customers or whatever are unfamiliar with source
code, consider distributing a script that does the compiling
for them as a part of installation.
