Subject: `mode &= ~current->fs->umask': Move from VFS to physical FSes!

I'm implementing ACLs. Project location:
<
http://major.rithus.co.at/acl/>.
In current kernels, the umask is applied to the create mask
passed to open(), creat(), and mkdir() in the VFS. If a
file system has Access Control Lists, whether the umask is
applied or not depends on the parent directory the file is
created in. So, the umask is not always applied.
There are two solutions to this problem:
1 Decide in the VFS whether the umask shall be applied or not.
   + existing code need not be changed.
   - It may not always be possible to decide
     this in VFS. Especially for access control mechanisms
     other than POSIX ACLs, there may be different rules.
   - Another test in VFS. In the physical file systems,
     such a test is often not needed.
2 Move the decision into the physical file system code.
I suggest solution 2.
Andreas
