Darn, I was asking the wrong question again.  Let me rephrase:
So which, if I may ask, are the advantages of your crash
count/transaction count design over the sprite lfs checkpoint design?
Allocation strategy is an interesting topic as well.  Rosenblum and
Ousterhout were wrong in their base assumption that read performance
won't matter long-term, as caches are exponentially growing.  It
turned out that storage size was growing just as fast and the ratio
remained roughly the same.  But let us postpone that for a while.
