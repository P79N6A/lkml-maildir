This is a _terribly_ misleading article.  There are only a few
little bits of truth in the article you have referenced, and even
that has been spun to exagerate the truth.
Broadcom has never released the source for the referenced chips
to the general public.  Those are closed source, binary-only,
mipsel drivers for kernel 2.4.5 that are embedded within the
device firmware.
