Hi,
I had some free time, so I was looking at some of the assembly code in
the 2.2.8 kernel, and had an idea at a particular point which I suspect
can increase checksum performance twofold. Someone give me their opinion,
ok, cuz
I'm new here and I don't have many skills yet.
In the arch/i386/lib/checksum.S file,  line 156:
40:
        addl -128(%esi), %eax
        adcl -124(%esi), %eax
        adcl -120(%esi), %eax
        adcl -116(%esi), %eax
        adcl -112(%esi), %eax
        adcl -108(%esi), %eax
        adcl -104(%esi), %eax
        adcl -100(%esi), %eax
        adcl -96(%esi), %eax
        adcl -92(%esi), %eax
        adcl -88(%esi), %eax
        adcl -84(%esi), %eax
        adcl -80(%esi), %eax
        adcl -76(%esi), %eax
this is, as I understand, a vastly unrolled loop to perfrom the
checksum. Note that on a dual pipeline machine, the second pipeline does
not get used at all in this routine. However, what happens if you change
it to:
40:
       ?pushl %ebx?
        addl -128(%esi), %eax
        adcl -124(%esi), %ebx
        adcl -120(%esi), %eax
        adcl -116(%esi), %ebx
        adcl -112(%esi), %eax
        adcl -108(%esi), %ebx
        ......
        adcl %ebx,%eax
    ?popl %ebx?
 Would it be possible to then combine the contents of eax and ebx, thus
allowing the processor to use both pipelines?
Thanks.
