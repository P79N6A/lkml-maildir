This one seems to bring back some issues with the network interface. The 
only noticeable symptom is dropping ~30 percent of new telnet 
connections under heavy load. When not loaded it still drops ~5 percent. 
I had no dropped connections with S4 even when loaded. This just happens 
to be one of things that I have been testing manually since I noticed 
some problems with previous patches.
Currently using an SMC card with a DEC 21140 chip and the tulip driver 
on my SMP system.
