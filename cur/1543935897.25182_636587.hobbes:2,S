thanks, applied. Nice catch!

it's a 2.6.24.1 candidate i believe. We trigger plenty of various 
crashes during x86.git maintenance and others hit various crashes in 
-mm, so by the time .1 is released we'll have it in .25 and can backport 
it. Most folks/distros will update to 2.6.24.1 very quickly so there's 
no risk of months loss of quality to kerneloops.org data either.
if there's more than 1-2 weeks to the v2.6.24 release we could merge it 
right now as well:
 Acked-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
because in a week we'll trigger plenty of crashes in -git based x86 
trees and will know about any regressions and will be able to reasonably 
trust it.
