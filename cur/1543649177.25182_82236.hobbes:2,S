Hi Matti, hi Dave,
I've adjusted my procmail filters now, still people using web archives
suffer from Richard's ignorance of the technical charta, his bad
trolling and offending everyone on the list.  As his previous posts
have been of a similar "quality" I'd like to request blacklisting him
from the vger list.
Thanks in advance,
	Christoph
