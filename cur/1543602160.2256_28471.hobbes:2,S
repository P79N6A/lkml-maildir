with kernel 2.4.10p12-p15 i found that with dvdplayer (xine)
when i make search in movie one of the thread is stopped in D state for seconds
(2-10 seconds) after it continue to work.
with 2.4.10p10(probably also p11) everything is good.
strace gave me ioctl(0x13,0x5392) so i found that itis in DVD_DO_AUTH
(in case of DVD_LU_SEND_ASF) so itis call to ide_cdrom_packet.
Any ideas?
Andrei
