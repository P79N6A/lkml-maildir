Ok, there's definitely something screwy going on.
Andrew located at least one bug: we run cancel_dirty_page() too late in 
"truncate_complete_page()", which means that do_invalidatepage() ends up 
not clearing the page cache.
His patch is appended.
But it sounds like I probably misunderstood something, because I thought 
that Martin had acknowledged that this patch actually worked for him. 
Which sounded very similar to your setup (he has a 32M ARM box too, no?)
And your failure sounds a lot like one that David Miller is reporting. At 
the same time, my own shared file mmap tests on my own machines obviously 
work fine (I lower the dirty-writeback tresholds to force writeback more 
easily, and then mmap a file and write and rewrite to it in memory, and 
truncate it).
Maybe it's mount option issue? I've got data=ordered on my machine, are 
you perhaps runnign with something else?

    [PATCH] truncate: clear page dirtiness before running try_to_free_buffers()
    
    truncate presently invalidates the dirty page's buffer_heads then shoots down
    the page.  But try_to_free_buffers() will now bale out because the page is
    dirty.
    
    Net effect: the LRU gets filled with dirty pages which have invalidated
    buffer_heads attached.  They have no ->mapping and hence cannot be cleaned.
    The machine leaks memory at an enormous rate.
    
    Fix this by cleaning the page before running try_to_free_buffers(), so
    try_to_free_buffers() can do its work.
    
    Also, remember to do dirty-page-acoounting in cancel_dirty_page() so the
    machine won't wedge up trying to write non-existent dirty pages.
    
    Probably still wrong, but now less so.
