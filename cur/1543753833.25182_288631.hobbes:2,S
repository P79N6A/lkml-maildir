Hi there,
I am running 2.6.10 from kernel.org on Debian Sid ppc/x86, the same
issue occurs with 2.6.9. Though, 2.6.8.1 and previous are fine.
When my ISP connection via PPPoE (kernel side) goes down, reconnection
does not occur, and the kernel displays continuous:
kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 to become free. Usage count = 1
This is that on both machine: x86 and ppc.
The only solution is a reboot, because pppd is not killable, and the
kernel keeps on with this message.
Does anyone have a solution? I am completely clueless. :( I thought
about stalled sockets, but how can I destroy them?
What is blocking ppp0?
What system outputs do you need to solve this?
Cheers.
