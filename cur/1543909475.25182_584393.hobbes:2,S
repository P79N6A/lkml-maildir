It's the Mail-Followup-To header you include in your emails:

The mail clients are just doing what you asked.  Perhaps you need to
turn off followup_to (and turn on edit_headers).
Mutt has "set honor_followup_to=ask-yes" to fix this in 1.5 (though it's
broken in "1.4.2.2i"); I don't know if the GUI clients have such a
switch.
