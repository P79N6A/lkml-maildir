Now that I have run it a bit longer I can see that the address is not always
the same. These are all the different lines that I have received so far:
kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c37ff020!
kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c37ff080!
kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c37ff8c0!
kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c37ff920!
kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (2) task from c37ff8c0!
I have 56 megs of memory (56M = 03800000).
