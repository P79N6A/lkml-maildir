Hello H. Peter,
the patch "avoid overflows in kernel/time" makes the ondemand cpufreq 
scheduler unusable. It looks like the cpufreq scheduler takes minutes to 
react on load changes.
I looked at the patch but did not found an obvious problem. Reverting this 
patch seems to fix the problem.
Do you have any ideas?
