Actually the standard that premits Ethernet frames with the extra 4
bytes required for VLAN tagging is 802.3ac, and it was approved already
in 1998.
You can get (a little) more information at:
http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/3/ac/index.html
Regarding support of modern net-gear, I believe most currently sold
switches|hubs|routers support this standrad.
