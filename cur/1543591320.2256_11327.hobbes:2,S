SCSI emulation over IDE, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI.  You have the SCSI mid
layer code but no SCSI hardware drivers.  It is a realistic case for an
embedded CD-RW appliance.
BTW, there is a bug in the current setting of CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI.
Starting with CONFIG_SCSI unset, you can set BLK_DEV_IDESCSI to y and
later set SCSI to n and get a mess, even with make oldconfig.  I am
discussing the fix with Andre Hendrick, expect BLK_DEV_IDESCSI to move
to the SCSI menu.
