(Sorry if this is duplicated, I've had a problem the first time)
I'm having a rather serious problem with ppa I've not seen discussed in
newsgroups:
I'm using Linux 2.2.14 with the PPA driver. My Zip drive is a parallel
zip 100.
I'm running a Celeron 450, my printer port is set to ECP+EPP in the
BIOS.
When I start copying files from the zip drive to a hard disk, it usually
hangs after a few dozens of megs : 
the application reports an IO error , the zip drive "read" light and the
motor won't stop, and the eject button doesn't work. I can unmount it
and unload ppa, but I have to power cycle the zip drive for things to
return normal.
This is not a problem with the zip disks, as it occurs on any file and
on any disk.
It seems to occur more under high load, and the whole system slows down
1 or 2 seconds before the I/O error occurs
