This is really a trademark related labelling issue.  The
trademark allows Linus or his assignee to specify in what
way Linux(tm) may be used in labelling and advertising.
Linux is just like other products with third-party parts and
supplies.  If Linus's assignee (Linux international?) where
to specify explicit guidelines then people would know what
to expect.  Something like:
Linux certified:
	Mainline kernel has driver and it has been certified
	as functioning with this hardware by OSDL or some
	other officially sanctioned lab.
Linux supported:
	Mainline kernel has driver.
Linux compatible:
	Source code driver available as a patch.
Runs on Linux:
	Binary only driver available that can be used with
	mainline kernel.
Supports Linux:
	Portion of the purchase price will be donated to
	Linux International.
You will notice this all relates to mainline kernels (Linus
and Marcello).  If the product requires a vendor kernel they
need to negotiate with the vendor to say so.
These are just suggestions.  Many other products (including
MS windows) have similar labelling restrictions, often with
logos.  Use of the term "Linux" in packaging or advertising
or products inconsistent with the official designations would
be trademark infringement.  Different rules would apply to
products that exist strictly in user-space.
