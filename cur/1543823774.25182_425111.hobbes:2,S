This can be cut out, along with gpio_irq in the bttv_sub_driver struct
at bttv.h. 
It was originally used by bttv's remote-control sub-driver, which ceased
to exist a few months ago (the functionality was merged into the main
driver for consistency with other v4l modules).
Mauro, this is change 30d12f67fd01 at my repo. Pull at will.
