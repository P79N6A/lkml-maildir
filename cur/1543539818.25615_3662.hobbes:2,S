Correct, however unless their own source includes GPL they don't
need to provide THEIR source.  Only source of GPL and any
modifications.  Providing source can be as simple as saying
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/
 in an email...
I doubt that they have a stock kernel though in an embedded
device so it likely has kernel modifications, and the above
doesn't make much difference.
