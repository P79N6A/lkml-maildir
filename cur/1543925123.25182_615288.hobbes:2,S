Yes, that's one way. But we need somewhere to stash the old flags.
Expanding the task struct sucks. Jamming another bit in the preempt
count sucks.
But I think we'd be best off stashing a single bit somewhere and
checking it at migrate time (relatively infrequent) rather than
copying and zeroing out a potentially enormous affinity mask every
time we disable migration (often, and in fast paths). Perhaps adding
TASK_PINNED to the task state flags would do it?

Some users of get_cpu might be relying on it to avoid actual
preemption. In other words, we should have introduced a
migrate_disable() when we first discovered the preempt/per_cpu
conflict.
