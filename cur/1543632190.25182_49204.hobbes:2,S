Are there any cases except oopses when decoding of addresses in kernel logs
is needed? The reason is I'd like to switch from klogd+syslogd to other
logging system and I was adviced to forget klogd and just get logs from
/proc/kmsg and decode them with ksymoops. While I have no problem with it
actually, my concern is - is it possible that some information in kernel
logs can be decoded by klogd but not by ksymoops?
Thank you
