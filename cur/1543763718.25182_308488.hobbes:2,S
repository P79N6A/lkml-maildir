You can define an inline function that is marked __deprecated and calls
the exported function:
extern void __synchronize_kernel(void);
static inline __deprecated synchronize_kernel(void)
{
        __synchronize_kernel();
}
===
void __synchronize_kernel(void)
{
        synchronize_rcu();
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__synchronize_kernel);
You could even make __synchronize_kernel() static to let it only be used
by modules, but that might create some confusion about the interface.
