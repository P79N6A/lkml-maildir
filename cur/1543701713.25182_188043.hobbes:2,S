AFAIK the definition of jump scrolling is that if xterm is falling
behind, it jumps. Jump scrolling is enabled by default.
What this slowness means is that xterm is getting CPU at just the
right moments that it isn't falling behind, so it doesn't jump - which
means X gets all the CPU to redraw, which means your ls/dmesg anything
else that reads from disk[1] doesn't get any CPU. 
Xterm is already functioning as designed - you can't force jump
scrolling to jump more - it is at the mercy of how it gets
scheduled. If there is nothing more in the pipe to draw, it has to
draw.
These bloody interactive changes to make X more responsive are at the
expense of anything that does *real* work.
[1] Others say that it only affects them first time through - after
something is cached, it goes back to normal speed. For me - it is slow
*all* the time. If I pipe it to cat or tail or something, it is a
*lot* quicker.
