Thanks very much for your insight.  I do appreciate it.
I do agree that the next step will be to write a kernel module.  However, I would like to see if it is feasible to do this with inb(), since I see no very easy way around the fact that I do not want the program to work remotely.
Really, the question boils down to this: Is the keyboard status port on AMD systems 0x64, or is it something else?  If so, what is it?
Thank you!
Brett
