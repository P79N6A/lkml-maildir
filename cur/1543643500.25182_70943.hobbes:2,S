the attached patch (ontop of the previous exit.c patches), fixes one more
exit-time resource accounting issue - and it's also a speedup and a
thread-tree (to-be thread-aware pstree) visual improvement.
in the current code we reparent detached threads to the init thread. This
worked but was not very nice in ps output: threads showed up as being
related to init. There was also a resource-accounting issue, upon exit
they update their parent's (ie. init's) rusage fields - effectively losing
these statistics. Eg. 'time' under-reports CPU usage if the threaded app
is Ctrl-C-ed prematurely.
the solution is to reparent threads to the group leader - this is now very
easy since we have p->group_leader cached and it's also valid all the
time. It's also somewhat faster for applications that use CLONE_THREAD but
do not use the CLONE_DETACHED feature.
