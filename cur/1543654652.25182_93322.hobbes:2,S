One could argue that a "important new hook" would provide a sane dummy
operation, or that if the module doesn't need it, why would it want to
provide it?  :)
Anyway, there's no way to resolve both this percieved problem, and the
"smaller and easier" patch that I proposed, right?  Unless we want to
export all dummy operation functions for all modules to use?  I could do
that, but it's pretty messy...
