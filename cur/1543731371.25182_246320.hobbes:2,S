Not just the different architectures: also different CONFIG options (e.g. SMP
vs. UP).
Open Source drivers with binary firmware are `automatically'[*] supported on
whatever Linux kernel you want.
Binary-only drivers are supported on one architecture, for one specific kernel
version, for one combination of config options.
Although Open Source firmware would be very nice, hardware + firmware can more
or less be considered equivalent to ordinary hardware, i.e. the manufacturer
_could_ have done everything in hardware. That's similar to CPUs with hardwired
logic and CPUs with (programmable) microcode. The firmware has the advantage
that you can fix `hardware' bugs without running a new generation of the actual
hardware.

[*] Within reasonable constraints.
P.S. Perhaps I sound a bit more permissive than usual, but it's getting late
     ;-)
