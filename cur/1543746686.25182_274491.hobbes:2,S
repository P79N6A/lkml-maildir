So instead of waiting a moment for the ED to finish
its normal processing and move from state ED_UNLINK
into ED_IDLE, you want to always clobber the whole
USB device tree attached to that bus?  That'd happen
quite routinely.
This isn't a good patch either... maybe your best
bet would be to find out why the IRQs stopped getting
delivered.
