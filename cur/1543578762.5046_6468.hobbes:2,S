And the fact that it doesn't work if you turn module support off, which
you'd want to do on an embedded kernel.  Unfortunately, this is one of
the times when you do want the MTD stuff.  You either have to put up
with no MTD support, write your own, or put up with the extra space of
module symbols.
Therefore, get_module_symbol() as it stood was the wrong interface to
use, and I completely agree with Keiths decision to remove it.  However,
I'm not sure that the inter_* stuff that replaced it is much better for
the reasons David has highlighted previously wrt link ordering.
