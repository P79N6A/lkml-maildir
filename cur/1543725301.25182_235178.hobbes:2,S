Hello,
Can I set up a ramdisk and use loopback encryption to encrypt it?
As far as I understand, the OS will keep data encrypted on the hard 
disk at all times and decrypts it in RAM only as it's read. So an encrypted 
executable on physical hard disk will be decrypted page by page upon
reading to RAM. But what happens to an executable sitting in ramdisk?
Can I also encrypt it? Since the code is in RAM, it should be running in place,
how do kernel deal with encrypted code and run? 
Any comments?
Thanks in advance!
Lei
