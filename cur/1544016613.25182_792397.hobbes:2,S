I agree with that.

All I am saying is that let rmdir() fail if there are tasks or
children, which I suspect cgroup takes care of. The second thing to do would
be to add a mem_cgroup_get_hierarchical() and _put_hierarchical() API's so
that we can get references all the way up to the parents. My concern
is that not calling res_counter_uncharge() can lead to dangling
references and bad behaviour.

That might be a good idea and also a good idea to maintain the
hierarchy (since we will walk up when we do uncharge) until we know
that css reference count is down to 0.
