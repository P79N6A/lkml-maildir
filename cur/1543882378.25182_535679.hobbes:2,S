Hmmm.. hmmm... serious hackery here. Isnt there some way to simplify the 
core impact and make the arch select a strategy? A boot option would be
less impact (I am a bit concerned about switching zonelist mid stream).
The arch should be able to specify a default zone order. So the best thing 
would be to make the zone orders configurable in the page allocator and 
then have the arch code determine a default order depending on the 
hardware that we are running on.
Make sure that the !CONFIG_ZONE_DMA case works.
What about ZONE_DMA32 support?
