Subject: 2.6.24-git2: Oracle 11g VKTM process enters R state on startup and is unkillable

I finally had a bit of time to try out different kernel versions to find
 out where this began... and it's in 2.6.24-git2.
What happens: Oracle 11g starts up and forks a number of so
 called background processes. Starting in  2.6.24-git2 the VKTM
 process never fully completes its initialization but gets in R state,
 never accumulating CPU, and can't be straced/gdb'd/killed.
Sysrq-T reports for VKTM looks like this

2.6.24-git1 is okay
2.6.24-git2 is bad
...
2.6.24-git20 is bad
Only differences in kernel .config between -git1 and -git2 are

Symptom is similar to what Rafael reported here
  
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0801.3/4114.html
 and similarly VKTM attempts to run at elevated priority as normal
 user process (Oracle kernel binary is not setuid root).
Peter Zijlstra's patches mentioned in the above thread, at
 
http://programming.kicks-ass.net/kernel-patches/sched-rt-group
 ,
 do not appear to be in -git20 yet.
I'm available for further testing. Thanks, ciao,
