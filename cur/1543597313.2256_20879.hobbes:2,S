It's not a requirement in the sense that you can't run a system where swap < 
2 * RAM. It's afaik merely a strong suggestion, both for servers and 
workstations. About the difference between 2.4 and 2.2: IIRC Rik van Riel 
(maybe it was Alan Cox or some other person, I'm not sure) wrote some time 
ago to the list, telling that the requirement is not here to stay. Current 
VM is balanced around the 2*RAM-idea, but much work is being done on the 
memory-subsystem, so it shouldn't take too long (as in: before the release 
of 2.6/3.0...) before it's better. For some discussion about this subject, 
take a look at 
http://gathering.tweakers.net/showtopic.php/172437
 or 
http://gathering.tweakers.net/showtopic.php/161652
 (both in dutch, My nick 
there is 'odysseus', as you'll see).
