    I am afraid that large, proprietary companies with intrest in the
    Linux market will lead to the death of GNU/Linux. 
There is certainly a danger, but we are not entirely helpless against
it.  We can reduce the danger, if we teach the millions of new
GNU/Linux users to value freedom--not just convenience and high tech.
Each additional user who starts to insist on freedom
makes us stronger, so if we reach just a fraction of the users,
we are still doing a considerable amount of good for our community.
