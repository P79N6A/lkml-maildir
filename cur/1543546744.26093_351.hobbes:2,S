The patch on 
http://www.rhdv.cistron.nl/sigqueue.html
 does something like 
this.
It has a linked list with all the threads in the thread group. There is no 
thread group ID. The existing kill() system call does the "right thing" when 
a signal is sent to a process with a thread group (i.e. send it to the shared 
signal queue).
Of course then you need a separate system call to send a signal to an 
individual thread, this one I call kill_thread(). This call is used by 
pthread_kill().
It needs some more work. It doesn't handle SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, etc. correctly 
for instance.
However it is actual tested code, so shoot.
