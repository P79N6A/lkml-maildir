I think this trace was taken while java was doing exactly what it was
doing before.  I actually restarted java many, many times with
2.6.16.9 and watched in amazement as it failed each and every time,
with the exact same error message.  This is tomcat, specifically, and
it would die immediately after startup and it was started the exact
same way with the init script.  So, yeah, I think this trace is
representative.  I have no idea why it doesn't contain what you would
consider relevant.  I'm no programmer, unfortunately.  However, I
would like to help out any way that I can.

bizaar.  I must say that this patch 'fixing' the problem just cannot
be coincidental.  Tomcat will never start without it, and never fails
with it.

well, this is just a test box for a system we deploy on a dual-cpu
server with 4GB of ram.
can you describe the CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G_OPT and how I might find it in
'make menuconfig'?  is it the second option (3G/1G user/kernel)?  I"ve
got the first option selected which is 3G/1G user/kernel as well, but
different somehow.  As this is new to 2.6.16, I'm not familiar with
the options.  Perhaps my 1GB workstations would benefit from this
second 3G/1G option?

Unfortunately I cannot speculate as to the cause, but experimentally
(anecdotally anyway) the patch is 100% effective.

I'd never accuse you of nonsense, but I cannot refute the evidence. ; )
if there is anything else you would like me todo to try to squeeze
more data from this thing, please let me know.
