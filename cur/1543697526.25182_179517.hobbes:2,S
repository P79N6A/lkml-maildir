As the kernel would need to communicate with userspace anyway, I believe
getting the file name directly from the kernel shouldn't be too much to
ask for. The kernel already knows it and we save the lookup operation in
userspace that is needed each time we receive an event.
However getting inode and event type would still be a huge improvement, 
because right now we have to stat all files in a directory and compare
it with a stored version, to find out what happend.
