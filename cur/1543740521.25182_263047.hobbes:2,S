I have done some experiments with this video post stuff.
I think this should be done using x86 emulator rather than doing 
in real mode. The reason being, with an userlevel emulator we can call
it at different times during resume. The current real mode videopost
does 
it before the driver has restored the PCI config space. Some systems 
(mostly the ones with Radeon card) requires this to be done after 
PCI config space is restored. With a userspace emulator, we can 
call it at various places during the driver restore.
I have seen the SciTech's x86 emulator in X.org. I could seperate it out
from X into a stand alone application that does x86 emulation. I use it
to get 
the video back on my laptop (which has radeon card), by calling this
user level 
emulator using usermodehelper call. I hope we will have x86 emulator
sitting in 
a standard place in userspace. That way we can use it in driver restore
and 
solve the S3 video restore problem in a more generic way.
Thanks,
Venki
