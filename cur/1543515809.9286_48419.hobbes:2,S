There is a mechanism in the patch to pass AS_KERNEL to map_user_kiobuf()
so that the kernel pages are tagged appropriately for raw I/O.  Given
that, when sd_raw_rw() is called, if the f_reada flag of the file
pointer is DUMP_KIOBUF_NUMBER, we automatically set AS_KERNEL.

If you have the appropriate patch, this should all work correctly.
