concerning kernel panic on poweroff
keywords:
kernel panic, ATX poweroff feature, EPOX mainboard
description of my problem:
dear linux-kernel-developer,
a few weeks ago I compiled my linux-kernel so that it supports the
poweroff-function; so
I decided to mark both apm-support and poweroff on shutdown support in
the make
menuconfig program; after that I compiled my kernel and also changed the
/sbin/init.d/halt file so that my computer runs halt with the p -option
(halt -p) now;
and since then my computer has always been getting a kernel panic when
powering off;
what you see here is the output of my /usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux
file
Kernel modules         2.2.2-pre6
Gnu C                  egcs-2.91.66
Binutils               2.9.1.0.22

Sh-utils               1.12
Modules Loaded         serial memstat nls_iso8859-1
the problem is that my computer tells me oops 0000 and after that quite
a few numbers
which I don´t understand; I think it dumps the registers of my prozessor
which is an 350
MHz AMD; but it does not poweroff; it remains at the point where the
registers are dumped
and that´s all; by the way, this error is probably due to my hardware,
so I will tell you
about my mainboard:
manufacturer: EPOX 
model:        EP-MVP3G
specification:
supports ATX power supply connector for a remote off
supports cpu hardware sleep, APM and ACPI (advanced configuration power
interface)
VIAv Apollo MPV3 AGP/PCI chipset
ZIF socket 7;
furthermore I read the instructions given in the oops-tracing.txt file
coming along
with the documentation; but since that did not help I am asking you; 
moreover I must mention that this poweroff function works fine under
win98; but as I
think linux should be much better than windows this bug should be fixed;
finally I will add the my /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/defconfig file as an
attachment to
this email; nevertheless I think this bug comes from my hardware;
can you please tell me
where the source code for this poweroff function normally is and what I
have to change 
in order to make my system work fine
thanx
