Yes, and we have discussed that already, but frankly I'm still unconvinced. ;-)

I don't think there's a bug as such.  The refrigerator is just very simple
and apparently does not cover all possible cases.
I think the problems with freezing tasks are generally related to
uninterruptible processes waiting for events that never happen.
IMHO we can try to defer calling freeze() for kernel threads until all of the
user space processes are frozen.  If that doesn't help, we'll need to treat
uninterruptible tasks in a special way, I'm afraid.
Greetings,
Rafael
