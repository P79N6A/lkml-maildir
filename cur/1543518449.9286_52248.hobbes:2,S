Hi!
With 2.3.30/31 and probably quite a number of earlier versions I get the
following:
/lib/modules/2.3.30/misc/matroxfb.o: unresolved symbol(s)
	fb_alloc_cmap_Rsmp_07a890c8
	fb_default_cmap_Rsmp_a56557ea
	fb_get_cmap_Rsmp_23fd4c45
	fb_copy_cmap_Rsmp_3d68266c
	fb_set_cmap_Rsmp_351aa8f5
(all defined in drivers/video/fbcmap.c)
The reason is I have matroxfb compiled as module and as apparently only
matroxfb has any references to symbols defined in fbcmap.o, the linker
won't include the fbcmap.o portions of video.a into vmlinux. I guess it's
not for the first time this sort of problem arises, so what's the usual
way to work around it? Changing the Makefile from using LX_OBJS, L_OBJS,
L_TARGET to OX_OBJS and friends comes to mind, but I'm uncertain whether
this is really desirable? 
For completeness, here's the relevant section of my .config:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX=m
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB8=m
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB16=m
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB24=m
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB32=m
CONFIG_FONT_8x8=y
CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
Regards,
Daniel.
