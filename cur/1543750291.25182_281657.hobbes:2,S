Not necessarily.  I am sure many of Nvidia's potential customers want to
do high end simulation and that requires an RT capable OS and good
graphics hardware.  If many people end up using RT preempt for high end
simulator applications, like several who have posted on this list, then
it seems like it would a good fit.
