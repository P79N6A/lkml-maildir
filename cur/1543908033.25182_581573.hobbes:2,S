What about the statement at the top of COPYING in the top level kernel source 
directory?
I know, you've got examples in mind where a kernel module and a userspace
program are dependent on each other and none of them can be used without the 
other. Of course, we've got such a case for a UIO kernel module and userspace
driver. But if the degree of dependency between kernel and userspace can
constitute a different legal situation, then we have a _very_ large legal
grayzone.

OK, I agree. But in comparison to using /dev/mem for these tasks, I still 
consider UIO an improvement. 
Thanks,
