If you move the flags you still break drivers since there is no literals
other than the PCI_XXX ones or hard-coded values grabbed from PCI spec  
that allow to deal with the flags. Breaking several times drivers by doing
incomplete changes looks way stupid to me.
The PCI stuff seems to me far from being stable and for now the flags are
just the PCI BAR flags. On the other hand I want the both drivers to also
work for 2.0, 2.2 and 2.3. For these reasons I do prefer for the moment a
very short patch that just adds the flags to the tampered BARs returned in
the pci_dev, and leave unchanged the code that deals with the base|flags 
things as if they were real PCI BARs.

But it does not care at all about other linux versions, and there is still 
some work-around for PPC it also does not care about.
COULD THE MAINTAINER OF THE PCI CODE MAKE AVAILABLE THE FINAL
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE CHANGES HE INTENDS TO APPLY TO THE pci_dev 
STRUCTURE AND THAT MAY IMPACT PCI DEVICE DRIVERS ?
