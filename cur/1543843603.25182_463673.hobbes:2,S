this is being worked on actively: there's the "djprobes" patchset, which 
includes a simplified disassembler to analyze common target code and can 
thus insert much faster, call-a-trampoline-function based tracepoints 
that are just as fast as (or faster than) compile-time, static 
tracepoints.
there's no fundamental reason why INT3 should be the primary model of 
inserting kprobes. Sometimes we are unlucky and the code which we target 
is too complex - then we take a few hundred cycles of a penalty. If that 
piece of code is a really common destination then we can add a static 
marker in the source which both prepares parameters and inserts a 
sufficiently sized NOP (or a function call) to prepare things for fast 
dynamic tracing - but it should only be an optional performance helper 
that we have the freedom to zap.
(kprobes can be thought of as a special "JIT", and there's no 
fundamental reason why it couldnt do almost arbitrary transformations on 
kernel code.)
and there's alot more that kprobes/systemtap can do: it can be a method 
of extending the kernel along a 'plugin' model - without having to 
impact the kernel source! That way people can experiment with kernel 
extensions on live kernels, without the barrier of recompile/reboot.
