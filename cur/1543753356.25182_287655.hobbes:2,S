Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Remove input_call_hotplug

Hi all,
the input subsystem is using call_usermodehelper directly, which breaks 
all sorts of assertions especially when using udev.
And it's definitely going to fail once someone is trying to use netlink 
messages for hotplug event delivery.
To remedy this I've implemented a new sysfs class 'input_device' which 
is a representation of 'struct input_dev'. So each device listed in 
'/proc/bus/input/devices' gets a class device associated with it.
And we'll get proper hotplug events for each input_device which can be 
handled by udev accordingly.
Drawback is that a new event type (the said 'input_device') is added, so 
that hotplug scripts and udev might need to be adapted to handle it 
properly. And each device driver needs to be touched to write something 
meaningful as the class_id. A fallback is provided, but by neccessity is 
not very informative.
Patch 1/2 implements the core changes to drivers/input/input.c
Patch 2/2 provides proper device names for input drivers.
Patches are relative to bk://kernel.bkbits.net/vojtech/input
Comments are welcome.
Please CC me directly as I'm not on this list.
Cheers,
Hannes
