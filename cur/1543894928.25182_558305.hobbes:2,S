I don't know whether schedule_delayed_work() requeues event_work, or if
it adds more work, but both seem to give wrong behaviour: In the first case
event_work can be postponed forever if atkbd_schedule_event_work() is
called repeatedly each time within 50 ms, and for the second case there's a
delay added, but the number of times the LED is switched stays the same,
so it's not being throttled.
