If anything, that would make *him* slightly confused, because no sane  
person can doubt that the ANSI C standard *does*, indeed, cover the  
library. And "Programming language C" happens to be the name of that  
standard.

So does every other language I've run across, and I've seen many.

Only when you define Pascal as exclusively the version that Wirth defined.  
Well, I guess even that is still used for the original purpose (teaching  
programming).
OTOH, I certainly currently earn most of my income by programming a  
language *I* call Pascal. And the guys who sold us those compilers seem to  
think of this as one of their more important products.
And there's certainly active development on gpc.
I don't know what definition of "dead language" you're using, but it's  
certainly not one I'm familiar with.

That's probably why I've never seen a book about M2 (including from Wirth)  
that didn't define at least some parts of the library.

*What* strawman? I don't see any.
