For the context of the problem that we are dealing with, I think this fact
that writes are made "visible" to other CPUs (before smp_mb() finishes and 
before other reads are started) is good enough.
Oleg, with all these inputs, I consider the patch I had sent to be correct.
Let me know if you still have some lingering doubts!
P.S :- Thanks to everybody who reponded clarifying this subject.
