JG,
This is the right move after months of debating ideas.
Migrating the contents of ./drivers/ide/pci to scsi is reasonable too.
This will allow the legacy drivers to die.
Taskfile came to late to be really useful, it is now best used as a model
to tackle FIS/FPDMA mapping for SATA II.
Linus, my professional opinion is to follow Jeff's direction for 2.5/2.6.
This will allow Linux to push open source to the hardware vendors.
There are several bastardized scsi-ide drivers in ./scsi.
pci2000.c,h :: pci2220i.c,h :: psi240i.c,h + psi_*.h :: eata*
ATAPI is nothing more than Bastardized SCSI beaten with an ugly stick.
Packet-Taskfile is more than painful, and I am not in the fighting mood.
Cheers,
Andre
