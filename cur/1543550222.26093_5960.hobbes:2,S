Hmm. I double click on the ps output and single click to paste.
The number of digits does not play a role.

I never give such commands, but just tried:
aeb      119876    1   426   236  0 23:32 tty1     00:00:00 xterm
aeb      119877 119876 119877 119877  0 23:32 pts/9 00:00:00 -bash
aeb      119884 119877 119884 119877  0 23:33 pts/9 00:00:00 ps -efj
as you see, the ps program here fails to align the columns,
but otherwise all is well.

There are a few weaknesses that can be exploited using a wraparound.
With 100 processes/sec that takes 497 days with a 32-bit pid
and 5 minutes with a 16-bit pid.
