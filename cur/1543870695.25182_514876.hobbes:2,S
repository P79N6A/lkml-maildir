Tim, it's possible that the problem you're seeing is completely
different to the one Pavel is looking for. Given that you're down to
looking in console write code, I wonder if it's related to the changes
to console suspending that were done around that time. I'd suggest
either looking in LKML or Linux-PM archives for a commit related to
suspending the console, or doing your git bisect.
