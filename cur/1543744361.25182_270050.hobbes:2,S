No, you're not.  While I sent out all the patches to make the first
patch useful, the stacker patch was the same one I've been using with
several other approaches to sharing the void * security arrays.  If
the first patch turned out to be acceptable, the stacker patch would
have been tweaked quite a bit.  As Chris Wright pointed out, the list
of stacked modules would no longer need to be a linked list, and so
the semaphore guarding that list could be dropped.  And of course
your points are valid.
I am working on a new implementation, which I will send first to the
lsm list and lsm and selinux maintainers.  Lmbench numbers from this
morning show that with this approach, a kernel with selinux +
capabilities shows no performance degradation.
thanks,
