Absolutely not. 
You have a corrupted pack somewhere. I suspect that you may have 
interrupted a "rsync" transfer, and have a partial pack-file (or, in this 
case, the index file _descibing_ that pack-file) in your repository as a 
result.
Did you perhaps do a ^C in frustration when you first did the rsync: pull, 
and noticed that it was going to pull the whole big new pack-file?
It's kind of as if you had copied a CVS archive by doing a "cp -r" on 
CVSROOT, and interrupted it half-way. 
You can run
	git fsck-objects --full
which will do a full fsck and warn about anything it finds.
(and any pack it complains about you should just remove: if it turns out 
that the pack actually contained some data you need, at worst you can then 
use "rsync" to repopulate the .git object database, and while some object 
damage can be repaired, it's simply not _worth_ repairing it).
