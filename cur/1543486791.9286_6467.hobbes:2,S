cdrecord uses the sg device to talk to your CDR and tries to get a 32k
physically continuous buffer (SG_BIG_BUF). After your system is up and
running for a while, this allocation is likely to fail because of memory
fragmentation. It might help to compile sg into the kernel or to manually
load sg right after booting. You could also try some tricks, such as running
a memory hog program, having your machine swap a lot, finishing it and
loading sg then.

Seems to agree with my theory with failing allocation of SG_BIG_BUF
Hope this helps,
