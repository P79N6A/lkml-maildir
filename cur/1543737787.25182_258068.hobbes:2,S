It doesn't work for me:
# ps aux | grep [t]hread
michich   7447  0.0  0.0     0    0 pts/1    Zl+  09:43   0:00 [threadbug] <defunct>
# ps auwxH | grep [t]hread
#
And I can't inspect /proc directly:
# cd /proc/7447
# ls -l
ls: cannot read symbolic link cwd: No such file or directory
ls: cannot read symbolic link root: No such file or directory
ls: cannot read symbolic link exe: No such file or directory

Isn't it strange?
