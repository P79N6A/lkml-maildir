You should update your firmware regardless of using TCQ because the errors 
you experienced have nothing to do with TCQ but a lot to do with buggy 
firmware. See what I found written about the firmware update on this 
webpage (Phil Randal posted this URL earlier on in this thread):
         
http://www.geocities.com/dtla_update/
---snip---
While S.M.A.R.T. offline scan running in background, a read error could
cause a potential failure. This is corrected with current microcode.
(A5AA/A6AA) will detect and prevent application specific usage patterns
that cause excessive dwell times in particular areas.
