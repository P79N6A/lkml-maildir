That's an alternative, of course.
But that _is_ a branch, and does need active forward- and (mainly)
backward-porting work.
There's nothing wrong with it per-se, but it becomes a "stabilised version
of the kernel.org tree" or even a "production version of the kernel.org
tree".  In other words it's somewhere on the line between the mainline
kernel.org tree and a distribution.  How far along that line should it
be positioned?
