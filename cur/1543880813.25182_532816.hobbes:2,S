I'm looking for some testers for a revamp of the initio driver. No real
code changes other than to hopefully stop it exploding on load on 64bit,
but a major reorganisation, commenting and "de-windowsification" so the
code is actually readable and I can do the pci_find_device to
pci_get_device transitions.
