Subject: [PATCH 0/4] ppc64: Introduce BPA platform
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This series of patches add support for a fifth platform type in the
ppc64 architecture tree. The Broadband Processor Architecture (BPA)
is currently used in a single machine from IBM, with others likely
to be added at a later point.
I already sent preparation patches before, these need to be applied
on top of them.
The first three patches add the actual platform code, which should
be usable for any BPA compatible implementation.
The final patch introduces a new file system to make use of the
SPUs inside the processors. This patch is still in a prototype stage
and not intended for merging yet.
