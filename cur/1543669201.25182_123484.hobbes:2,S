no, SET_MODULE_OWNER is quite intentionally independent of the struct. 
It only requires a consisnent naming in the source, between structures 
that may use the macro.
That's a feature.

no, farther back than that, to infinity and beyond :)  The idea of the 
macro is that on earlier kernels, it is simply a no-op, and module 
refcounting is handled by other means.

demonstrate?  grep for it.  It's used quite a bit.  Removal of 
SET_MODULE_OWNER looks to me to be pointless churn for negative gain. 
If if you wish to pointedly ignore the old-source compatibility angle, 
it is a nice convenience macro.
