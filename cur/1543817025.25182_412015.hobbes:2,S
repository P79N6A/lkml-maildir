The overlapping is important if you want to pretend that the
namespace-able resources are allowed to be specified per-process, when
really they are specified per-family.
In this way, a process family is merely a grouping of processes with
like namespaces, and depending on which way they overlap you get the
same behaviour as when processes only have one resource different, and
therefore remove the overhead on fork().
