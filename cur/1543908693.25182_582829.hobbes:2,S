Already done:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-doc&m=118671778606001&w=2
It checks the index.html files so you have to run 
http://kernel.org/doc/make/docdiridx.py
 and then run 
http://kernel.org/doc/make/doclinkcheck.py
 afterwards.  It shows you the 
files 00-index links to which aren't there (the 404 errors), and then the 
files that nothing links to.
I notice that I'm not filtering out the generated index.html files, but oh 
well.  I'll fix that... :)
