Hi all,
Can please someone let me know what is criteria for default kernel
configuration .
Is it based upon some survey or requested by Fedora or others.
By default configuration size of vmlinux is 41 MB and it includes
approx 75% of useless stuff for me.
what is the idea behind 'default kernel configuration'. Is it made for
developers's PC  or for someone else.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
