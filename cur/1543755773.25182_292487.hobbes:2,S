Here it is, with the suggestions from Pete and Dmitry included. The
patch does the following:
* Compensates for the lack of floating point arithmetic by keeping
  track of remainders from the integer divisions.
* Removes the xres/yres scaling so that you get the same speed in the
  X and Y directions even if your screen is not square.
* Sets scale factors to make the speed for synaptics and alps equal to
  each other and equal to the synaptics speed from 2.6.10.
