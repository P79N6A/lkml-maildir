The other reason we need a separate critical pool is to satifsy critical 
GFP_KERNEL allocations
when we are in emergency. These are made in the send side and we cannot 
block/sleep.

Yes, it is true that sizing the critical pool may be difficult if we use 
it for all incoming allocations.
May be as an initial solution we could just depend on dropping 
non-critical incoming packets
and use the critical pool only for outgoing allocations. We could 
definitely size the pool if we use
it only for allocations for critical outgoing packets.
