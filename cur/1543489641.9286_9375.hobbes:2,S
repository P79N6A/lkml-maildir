And having all Glide-using apps setuid root isn't?  Granted it isn't a
perfect solution, but it's the lesser of two evils because it allow
finer control over who gets access.  Running an unstable app like Wine
as root to get Glide access doesn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling.  And
at least with the module, the app doesn't get blanket root privileges.
I don't think it should go into the mainstream kernel, but your argument
doesn't consider the alternative.
