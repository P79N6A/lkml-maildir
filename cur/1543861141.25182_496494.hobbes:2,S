Hi,
   unfortunately it is not everything :-(
I cannot get MSI to work on IDE interface under any circumstances - in 
legacy mode it always uses IRQ14/15 regardless of whether MSI is enabled 
or not (that's probably correct), but in native mode as soon as I enable 
MSI it either does not deliver interrupts at all (definitely not through 
IRQ14/15, and, if I got routing right, also not through its INTA#), or 
it delivers them somewhere else than where programmed.  As my boot 
device is connected to this adapter, and it is a notebook, it is not 
easy to debug what's really going on :-(
