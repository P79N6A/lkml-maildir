Subject: Binary files in the kernel sources?

Are there now, or have there at any point in time been any binary
files in the kernel tar.gz files?  Anything at all from png's,
bmp's to binary only firmware stored in a raw binary file, and
not embedded in C source.  Anything?  I've briefly looked, and
did a few rgreps, etc.. but haven't turned up anything.  This is
just a single kernel tree though...
The reason isn't important.. I just want to know.
TIA
