Please stop the Bullshit.  You have to update _something_.  It makes a
lot of sense to update the thing you need to udpate anyway for new
hardware support, and not some piece of junk library like libperfmon.

Of course it is.  And on many of my systems it's much easier to update a
kernel than a library.  A kernel I can build myself, for libraries I'm
more or less reliant on the distro or hacking fugly rpm or debian
packagging bits.
Having HW support in the kernel is a lot easier than in weird libraries.
