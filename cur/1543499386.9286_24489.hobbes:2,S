I'm not supprised it paniced, I would.  You've built ide support as a

Attempt to find our root filesystem on 0x03:0x08 (/dev/hda8).
No driver, so request_mod() for it.
> request_module[block-major-3]: Root fs not mounted
request_mod sanity check failed (/ not mounted), complain we can't load
modules yet.
> VFS: Cannot open root device 03:08
still no driver for rootfs dev, can't usfully continue.
> Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:08
so panic and stop here (actually for(;;) {} loop).
