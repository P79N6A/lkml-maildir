Subject: acpi shutdown problem on SMP (tyan tiger mp, athlon)

this problem first appeared in vanilla-2.6.2 and is still present in
vanilla-2.6.8-rc4 (vanilla-2.6.1 worked fine)
on shutdown the disks spin down, the VGA switches to powersave, but the
cpu-fans and the power-supply won't power down.
Anyone has a hint for me?
Thanks,
Alexander
