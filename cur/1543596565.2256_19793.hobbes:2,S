another bug triggers when the tasklet is re-enabled by another cpu in
this point:
			if (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state))
				goto repeat;
		}
		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
		tasklet_unlock(t);
		if (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state))
			tasklet_schedule(t);
then the check for test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state) will
trigger, but the tasklet_schedule won't queue the tasklet because
TASKLET_STATE_SCHED is just set in t->state.
This is fixed in my ksoftirqd patch. However one thing I'd like to
change in my patch is to add the BUG() that triggers in the case
mentioned yesterday.
