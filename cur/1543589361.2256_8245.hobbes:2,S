Hmm. I just checked Intel's web site (should've done so earlier), and it
appears that Intel still dubs the new revision as "Celeron", although I'm
sure it was introduced as CeleronII in some sources (try
http://www.google.com/search?q=CeleronII
). So I'll just have admit that your
first patch was technically correct, and I was wrong. Sorry for the
inconvenience.
I still think "Celeron II" is clearer, but heaven knows what Intel will sell
by that name three years from now (just think of i860).
