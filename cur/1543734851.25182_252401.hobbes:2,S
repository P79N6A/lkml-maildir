Thanks Judith,
That is awesome. I see the warnings were for different .c files than the ones my patches touched.
Warning List:
drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c:421: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c:428: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
RESULT: PASS
RESULT-DETAIL: 2 warnings, 0 errors
So it appears all is good with my patches. Thanks a lot!
Hanna
