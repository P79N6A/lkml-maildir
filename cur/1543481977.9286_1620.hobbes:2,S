> Abstract
> ========
>
> A problem has been identified which allows remote attackers to wedge
> many TCP services running on 4.4BSD-derived systems, including X
> servers and all services run from inetd.  Other (non-BSD) systems are
> believed to be affected as well.
>
>
> Technical Details
> =================
>
> Many TCP servers open a TCP socket in the default blocking mode, use
> select(2) to wait for connections, and then accept(2) connections in
> blocking mode.  Under some circumstances, the accept(2) may hang
> waiting for another connection, denying service to clients trying to
> connect to other ports.
>
> The scenario which causes this is:
>
> * Connection is initiated by client; 3WHS completes.
> * Server process is awakened and select(2) succeeds.
> * Connection is closed by client (e.g. by sending a RST).  Connection
>   is removed from accept(2) queue on server.
> * Server process does an accept(2), which hangs waiting for a
>   connection.
>
> This scenario is sometimes difficult to reproduce, particularly if the
> server is very fast and the network is relatively slow.  It is most
> effective if the server is slow and/or must do a lot of work between
> the select(2) and accept(2).
>
>
> Solutions and Workarounds
> =========================
>
> Two solutions are possible:
>
> 1) Modify all TCP servers to use non-blocking listening sockets.
>    Unfortunately, this requires changing a large amount of code, much
>    of it maintained by third parties.
>
> 2) Modify the kernel to not remove sockets from the accept(2) queue
>    when they are closed.  A change that implements this has been added
>    to NetBSD-current, and is available at:
>
