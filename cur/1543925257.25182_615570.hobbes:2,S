Us too! We're stuck trying to build a disk server with several disks
in a raid5 array, and the rsync from the old machine stops writing to
the new filesystem. It only happens under heavy IO. We can make it
lock without rsync, using 8 simultaneous dd's to the array. All IO
stops, including the resync after a newly created raid or after an
unclean reboot.
We could not trigger the problem with ext3 or reiser3; it only happens
with xfs.
