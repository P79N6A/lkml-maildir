Just after remounting /tmp as read-only, this error message appeared in the 
kernel log:
Sep 17 20:59:32 laptop kernel: EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,10)) in 
start_transaction: Readonly filesystem
Sep 17 20:59:32 laptop kernel: EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,10)) in 
ext3_delete_inode: Readonly filesystem
When I tried to mount it read-write a little later, this error message 
appeared:
Sep 17 21:08:18 laptop kernel: EXT3-fs warning: mounting fs with errors, 
running e2fsck is recommended
Sep 17 21:08:18 laptop kernel: EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on 
ide0(3,10), internal journal
I ran e2fsck on /dev/hda10 (the /tmp fs), it found some problem (inode fixed?) 
and fixed it.
It's like EXT3 forgotten to write some data back to the file system when I 
mounted it read-only :-), but remembered about it straight after mounting the 
file system read-only.
I'm still trying to reproduce the error messages, but I had no luck so far 
(both in 2.4.22-aa1 and in 2.4.23-pre4).
The file system is mounted with these options: noatime,defaults
Thank you
