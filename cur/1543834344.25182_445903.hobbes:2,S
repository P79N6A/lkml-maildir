Well, it's because the 2.4 mainline receives only bug fixes now. You can 
imagine that since 2.5 was started, new data types were added in 2.5/2.6 
but never backported to 2.4, especially if they were tied to 
infrastructural changes or new features.
Of course there may be downstream projects who maintain 2.4 drivers to 
further extent than the 2.4 mainline. But this doesn't imply a 
requirement to put compatibility code into 2.6.
