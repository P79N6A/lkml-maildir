?! I thought we are talking about linux here ?!
It should be multiuser fs and should be safe as it is. I know putting
users on different partition is good idea, but it is more like
"additional safeguard". What do you mean with much more
straightforward f*ckups?

PS: Filling partition does not work as 5% is reserved for root.
