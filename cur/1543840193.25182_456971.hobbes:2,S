If you are considering this infrastructure for generic resource
management, I have few concerns:
 - There is no CPU controller under this framework
 - There is no I/O controller under this framework
 - Minimum of 3 parameters need to be used to manage memory.
   (in other words, usage is not simple. In order to provide a minimum 
    guarantee of a resource, one needs to define a new parameter)

Here are some of other infrastructure related issues I have raised.

Yes, it does.
IMHO (as mentioned in a different email), a group with a resource
constraint should behave no different than a kernel with a specified
amount of memory. i.e it should do reclamation before it starts failing
allocation requests. It could even do it preemptively.
