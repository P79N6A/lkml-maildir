I'm now hitting exactly the same problem with 2.6.28-rc9 (I had
it with 2.6.27 too but thought it might go away on its own :)
I've made a small program to attempt to reproduce this based on
the asterisk code.  Unfortunately it doesn't work on its own.
However, if you run it under strace then it does hang in the
same away as asterisk (which seems to happen after the setuid
call, as strace shows it before hanging and the printk after
it in asterisk gets executed).
Note that the hang goes away if either setscheduler or setuid
is removed.
#include <sched.h>
int main(void)
{
	struct sched_param sched = {.sched_priority = 10};
	sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_RR, &sched);
	setuid(106);
	return 0;
}
Cheers,
