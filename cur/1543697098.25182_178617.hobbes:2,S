the obvious point that this leaves unneeded modules in kernel aside ...
that won't work that easy. You have to build name to match line from 
modules.alias. But to match you have to put exact values for `dl' and `dh'. 
Those values are simply not available when hotplug agent is called.
i.e. for the above line to match you have to supply exact values for vendor, 
product, device low, device high. Any other values are not important but 
these must be exact. But neither device low nor device high are known.
apparently the only way is to remove them and hope that usually the same 
vendor/product combination is handled by single driver.

that won't match, sorry. wildcards can be in aliases; they can't be in module 
names.
