The idea is to get equivalent performance to SCHED_FIFO. The results 
show that much, and it is 100 times better than unprivileged 
SCHED_NORMAL. The fact that this is an unoptimised normal desktop 
environment means that the conclusion we _can_ draw is that SCHED_ISO is 
as good as SCHED_FIFO for audio on the average desktop. I need someone 
with optimised hardware setup to see if it's as good as SCHED_FIFO in 
the critical setup.
I'm actually not an audio person and have no need for such a setup, but 
I can see how linux would benefit from such support... ;)
