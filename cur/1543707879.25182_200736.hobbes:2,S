Sorry, I know next to nothing about dm-crypt or crypt loop so far.
But I wonder: will it be possible to store some generic data in that place?
Password+Hash mechanism+Salt seemt to be pretty tied to passwords.
I would like it very much, if some rsa encrypted data could be stored instead,
so I can use a smart card with an rsa key to decrypt it.
Regards, Andreas
