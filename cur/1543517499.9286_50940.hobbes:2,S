Actually swapping a page out does not matter, because it will be swapped in
on behalf of *copy_*, but what you can worry about is that other thread
unmaps the page the pointer points to.
The difference between __copy* and copy* is in that copy* does verify_area
first.
verify_area does full checking on i386 AFAIK, checks whether the passed
address is valid on most other archs (i486+, non-ia32) and is a nop on sparc64.
You should not worry about i386 though because there would be issues just
everywhere with i386 SMP if somebody ran it, on other archs verify_area
can be done just once for each address interval (addr + size), it is not
influenced by anything else than the address value and size.
Cheers,
