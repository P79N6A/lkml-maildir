Let me try this again... To do the normal "reasonable" things associated 
with raw read, the standard SCSI command set includes commands in the 
read and seek sets which seem to be what is needed. These are standard, 
and I fail to see how allowing them, and only them, could be so 
complicated in the case where only read access is allowed. There is no 
need to allow vendor commands or any kind to permit programs such as 
checks and backups of various kinds to be used.
I think the same is true of write, filtering out anything but the set of 
write commands in the common SCSI command set is fine, and in the rare 
case where it isn't, I'm happy to say that raw write capability is the 
answer.
   read does not imply write
   write does not imply anything but data
firmware reload, low level format, spin in the other direction, all 
would require capability.
If you disagree with the above in some technical way, please clarify. If 
you just are opposing filtration on general principles because you run 
everything as root or don't believe in levels of security, I sure can't 
change your mind if you're willing to disagree with Alan.
