Hello everybody,
Up to now, nobody seems to have noticed it.
Running depmod -a -e, I get the following output :
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.19/fs/hfs.o
depmod: 	update_vm_cache
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.19/fs/smbfs.o
depmod: 	get_cached_page
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.19/fs/hpfs.o
depmod: 	hpfs_writepage
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.19/scsi/scsi_mod.o
depmod: 	init_task_union
Of course, these modules can not be used.
Maybe many other modules are also affected, I've only tested the ones
that can be used on my machine.
An 'artificical' module devfs.o has also been generated during
"make modules_install". It is just the normal object file, that
is used in the kernel, it has only accidently been copied to
/lib/modules/2.3.19/misc .
Greetings,
Andreas
