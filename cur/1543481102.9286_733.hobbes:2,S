The biggest problem is that p->counter is essentially a
random value because of the gross recalculation done in
the schedule() function.
If we were to use a more smoothed out recalculation
[p->counter = (((p->counter * 7) + p->priority + 7) / 8);]
then we could just use p->counter without ever having to
do any expensive recalculations.
