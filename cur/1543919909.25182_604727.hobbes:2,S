Greetings,
This is not the proper forum for compilation help (if nothing is broken of course). You would probably get good help asking on fedora forum (or simply do a search there). Looking at your log it seems to more reflect headers missing than anything wrong with the kernel in it self.
If you fail to find anything useful, I can help you but please send me mail directly so we don't put additional weight on 
this mailinglist.
Best wishes
