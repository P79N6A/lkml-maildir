<blockquote TYPE=CITE>IF OPERATING SYSTEMS RAN THE AIRLINES - by J. Hovind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______________________________________
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNIX Airways
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone brings one piece of the plane along
when they come to the
<br>airport. They all go out on the runway and put
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the plane together piece by piece, arguing
non-stop about what kind
<br>of plane they are supposed to be building.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air DOS
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides,
then they jump on
<br>and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they push again, jump on again, and so
on ...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mac Airlines
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers,
and ticket agents
<br>look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; questions about details, you are gently but
firmly told that you
<br>don't need to know, don't want to know, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything will be done for you without your
ever having to know,
<br>so just shut up.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Air
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terminal is pretty and colorful, with friendly
stewards, easy
<br>baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane
explodes with no
<br>warning whatsoever.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows NT Air
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses
much bigger planes, and
<br>takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radius when it explodes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linux Air
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines
decide to start
<br>their own airline. They build the planes, ticket
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counters, and pave the runways themselves.
They charge a small fee
<br>to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can also download and print the ticket yourself.
When you board the
<br>plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled,
the fully
<br>adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plan leaves and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrives on time without a single problem,
the in-flight meal is
<br>wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about the great trip, but all they can say
is, "You had to do what
<br>with the seat?"

<p>It has some good comments about it.
<p>Webbsidan har f&ouml;rutom tunna argument flera rena faktafel, till
exempel att Linux skulle ha n&aring;gon slags begr&auml;nsning p&aring;
swapfiler till 128MB, och att filstorleken &auml;r max 2GB.
<p>The Microsoft's webpage about NT is better than Linux has, besides very
thin arguments,
<br>many faulty facts.
<br>For example.. They say that the size of the swapfile on Linux is limited
to 128 Mb.. That's wrong.
<br>They say that the filesize is limited to a maximum of 2GB.. Also wrong...
<p>If Linux happened to be commercial, I bet MS would be suied for thoose
arguments! I bet you!
<p>Well.. MS can play along with their NT, whilst we other Pro's use Unix!
