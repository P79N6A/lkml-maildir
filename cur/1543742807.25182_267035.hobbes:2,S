Hi Ingo,
I finally got to test your patch again. Now I've been running -V0.6.2 
for almost two hours and have not yet encountered a single deadlock.
So it seems that the netfilter deadlock, that I could easily reproduce 
in -V0.4.1, is solved.
There is one strange thing, though:
michich@k4-912b:~$ uptime
  00:09:17 up  1:49,  7 users,  load average: 707.72, 706.40, 682.16
In fact my computer is mostly idle.
ps shows no zombies nor any D-state processes. The system runs fine.
Michal
