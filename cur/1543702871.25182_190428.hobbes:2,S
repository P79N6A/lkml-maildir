Hi,
is there a way to merge all (or at least the common denominator) of
Redhat's and SuSE's changes into the vanilla 2.4 SCSI stack?
The SCSI part of Marcelo's kernel seems to be rather backlevel,
considering all those fixes and enhancements added by the mentioned
distributors and their SCSI experts. As this discussion underlines,
there are a lot of common problems and sometimes even common
approaches.  I am convinced that a number of patches ought to be
incorporated into the mainline kernel. Though, I must admit
that I am at a loss with how this could be achieved given the
unresolved question of 2.4 SCSI maintenance
(which has certainly played a part in building up those piles
of SCSI patches).
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / with kind regards

But in RHEL3 the bug is fixed already (not in a released kernel, but the
fix went into our internal kernel some time back and will be in our next
update kernel).  From my internal bk tree for this stuff:
[dledford@compaq RHEL3-scsi]$ bk changes -r1.23
ChangeSet@1.23, 2003-11-10 17:19:54-05:00, dledford@compaq.xsintricity.com
  drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c
      Don't panic if the eh thread is dead, instead do the same thing that
      scsi_softirq_handler does and just complete the command as a failed
      command.
      Change when we wake the eh thread in scsi_times_out to accomodate
      the changes to the mlqueue operations.
      Clear blocked status on the host and all devices in
scsi_restart_operations
->    Don't grab the host_lock in scsi_restart_operations, we aren't doing
      anything that needs it.  Just goose the queues unconditionally,
      scsi_request_fn() will know to not send commands if they shouldn't
      go for some reason.
      Make sure we account SCSI_STATE_MLQUEUE commands as not being failed
      commands in scsi_unjam_host.
But, Jens is right, it's a real bug.  I just fixed it in a different
way.  And my fix is dependent on other changes in our scsi stack as
well.
