If the override boot option failed, its most likely your system doesn't
have an ACPI PM time source.  Instead it seems your system is having
trouble using the PIT as a time source (which seems not all that
uncommon unfortunately). 
I guess we can just re-call select_timer() without an override if the
override fails, that way you'll fall back to the default time source on
your system. Try the (compile tested) patch below and see if that helps.
Thanks for the feedback!
