I didn't dig into any patch and also not into related drafts/RFCs, but one
scenario should be catched I think - or to be discussed:
Scenario:
Address was already added by autoconfiguration on receiving advertisement
(limited lifetime). Now the same address would be added manually (unlimited
lifetime).
What (should) happen?
Mho: manual add is allowed, both addresses need to be listed.
