I've seen a lot of posts about the P4B533's recently with 2.4.1[89], so I
thought I'd post a success story.
2,4.20, using the intel ethernet driver(e100.c)
Both onboard IDE controllers work in DMA mode properly at full speed
without having to do any hdparm magic.
Onboard ethernet is detected and works at 100/FD.
I don't use the RAID function of the onboard HPT, so no idea on that, I
would expect that to work though.
No -VM boards here, so no video status.
Mike
