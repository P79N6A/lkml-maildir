This is a completely different problem having to do with the build for
the aicasm utility missing an explicit dependency regarding the generated,
but certainly not shipped, y.tab.h file.  The grammer recently changed
(a new token was added), so those with stale y.tab.h files were bitten.
Its on my list of things to fix.
