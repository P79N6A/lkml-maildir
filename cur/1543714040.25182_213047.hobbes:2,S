Yes, dropping and regaining the lock is asking for trouble.  Thank you for
catching this.  I don't have an issue with changing the interface name.
I guess the only question I have is if it's better to leave the setuid
handling in the core, and move the newly named hook under the task_lock()?
thanks,
