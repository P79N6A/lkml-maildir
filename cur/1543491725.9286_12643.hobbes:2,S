This is where you really don't understand.
If I said "special enabler flag" instead of setuid-root, would you like
the system better? I choose the old (now useless) setuid-root setting
to be my special enabler flag.
In other words, setuid-root gets overloaded for compatibility reasons.
You can still disable the setuid feature; in that case it would only
act as a special enabler flag.

Your admin (well, security officer) can set up the script as needed,
assuming the perl interpreter supports such operation.
(perl must be modified for either system -- scripts don't get privs)
What, you don't want the admin to know if your script suddenly grows
a network-aware password scanning feature? Hmmm...

No, the existing setuid policy is enough protection. It is the other
system which needs new enforcement code.

Actually, it does and it must. Try inserting a kernel module as a
normal user, without any setuid help.

Who said anything about glibc? I propose a simple tool to change
existing binary executables, used with plain old chmod and chown.

Such as?

Capabilities are not at all part of the Unix model. At least I don't
break tar, cpio, taper, bru, NFS (including non-Linux servers), and
really basic UNIX tools like /bin/mv and /bin/cp. You'd break them all.
