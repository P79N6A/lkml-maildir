Don't forget the low end of the scale too...
An interface of this type even has applicability in the absence of a
clock. Research in the Amulet group at Manchester University (home of
the Amulet processors - self-timed ARM cores) and elsewhere is looking
at management of /maximum/ power consumption (instantaneous power
consumption is a function of the work to be done) by constraining the
maximum number of instructions in flight, rather than the clocked
equivalent of capping the clock frequency. This might be done where
the power supply's capability is very limited (solar, wireless
induction, smartcard, wind, etc).  
This number can be managed by the processor if you build the right
peripheral into the system, and this would need an equivalent
interface for control - it wouldn't be a clock frequency, but it would
be a number controlling the /maximum/ speed of the processor.
