  i would think the obvious solution is to move the entire contents of
the s390-specific crypto/Kconfig into the generic one.  obviously,
everything would still work since all of those config options would
still depend on S390.
  i'm betting the S390 folks would *really* hate that idea but, if you
look closely, the generic Kconfig file *already* has some
arch-dependent content:
...
config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
        tristate "Support for VIA PadLock ACE"
        depends on X86_32     <-----
...
  i think it's a matter of deciding how to be consistent.  either you
allow individual architectures to define their own additional Kconfig
files or you don't.  mixing the two approaches is a recipe for
confusion.
