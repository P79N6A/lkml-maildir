*ace->data_ptr++ = le16_to_cpu((in_8(r)<<8) | (in_8(r+1)));
could help.

First, a () pair is lacking, it should - for safety - be
	(ace)->reg_ops->dataout(ace)
and since it may be evaluated twice too, inlines are a definite yes.

And const please :) IOW,
static const char *const ace_statenames
Btw, ACE_FSM_NUM_STATES is defines as 11 above, but I only see 10
elements in that array. Intentional?
Also, should this be unintentional, and the number state names
matches ACE_FSM_NUM_STATES, an array of unspecified size may do
the trick.

Check out loop.c, it gives some hints who owns that. :)
