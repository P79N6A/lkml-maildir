Yes. Works every time for me (on NUMA-Q), with huge corrections:
checking TSC synchronization across CPUs:
BIOS BUG: CPU#0 improperly initialized, has 6571 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#1 improperly initialized, has 6571 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#2 improperly initialized, has 6571 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#3 improperly initialized, has 6571 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#4 improperly initialized, has 20664 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#5 improperly initialized, has 20664 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#6 improperly initialized, has 20665 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#7 improperly initialized, has 20664 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#8 improperly initialized, has -4424 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#9 improperly initialized, has -4424 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#10 improperly initialized, has -4424 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#11 improperly initialized, has -4424 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#12 improperly initialized, has -22812 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#13 improperly initialized, has -22812 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#14 improperly initialized, has -22812 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
BIOS BUG: CPU#15 improperly initialized, has -22811 usecs TSC skew! FIXED.
I did try disabling it once, which stopped the system booting.
I never looked at it any further.
If you are crashing near the wait_init_idle fix, you might
try Ingo's scheduler patch - it has a different way of
fixing this race condition.
