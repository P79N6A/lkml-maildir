If even sparse can't handle these things, it's no surprise
how many gcc bogus warning problems we've run into because
of this hairy if() macro.
I don't think it's a good precedence to do this.  It's giving
up on trying to implement the branch tracer in a way that
results in a kernel build that produces useful warnings.
