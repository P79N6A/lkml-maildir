How about the cpusets approach, where once a cpuset has no children
and no processes, a usermode helper can be executed - this could
immediately remove the container/bean-counter if that's what the user
wants. My generic containers patch copies this from cpusets.

How about a small custom filesystem as part of the containers support,
then? I'm not wedded to using configfs itself, but I do think that a
filesystem interface is much more debuggable and extensible than a
system call interface, and the simple filesystem is only a couple of
hundred lines.
