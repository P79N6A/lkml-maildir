Listen to yourself, and understand why 2.5 failed.
"When a specification impedes usefulness, sometimes it's the right

"Gee there is no traffic in the on coming lanes, maybe I should use them."
There are rules for how the hardware works, and if everything out there
comes up in 4 seconds great.  If everything returns faster than the worst
case great.  You start assuming everything behaves that way and you repeat
history.
You guys in 2.5 walked away from the rules because you thought you knew
better, where did it get you?  Lost interrupts, PIO command block
exectution failures, dropping EOT on PRD's because reading something into
the published documents which is not there, etc ...

It is a means for probing signatures w/o identify to test for presence.
It to has a 31 second rule.  Break the worst case and device get lost.
We already have a problem with PPC and loosing devices.
This is where JG's hard work and my time with him explaining it will help
most.  Also case where RMK's ARM toys do fun things and the assumption by
the driver that POST is valid is DEAD WRONG.  I will repeat the assumption
of my code about POST is DEAD WRONG!  POST like events happen at different
times for various archs.

So if we were in the network stack and decided to chuck the "D-gram"
because it got in the way is that cool?
Better if we were in the scsi stack and blew off the queue list and
rammed an immediate SCB down the pipes that wastes the device queue tags
internal, is that okay.  The rules got in the way for this command I
wanted to beat down the controller.

Please do not take this personal, because it is a technical arguemnet.
We do it by the books and then we cheat when we can, but only after we
have all the proper stuff in place for compliance.
