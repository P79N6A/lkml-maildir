IMVHO, this is a bug in older versions of gcc and egcs.  These compilers
seem to run into trouble when too much restriction is placed upon their
register selection choices.
The very same thing happens if you use raid-0.90 in 2.3.x for the very
same group of compilers.. xor.c bombs.  [matters not to me.. haven't
been able to make raid-5 (hobby) work right in 2.3.>6 anyway.. yet:]
gcc-2.7.2.3 -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/tmp/linux-2.3.30-6.ikd.raid.fpumemcpy/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer  -D__SMP__  -pipe
  -DCPU=586    -c -o drivers/block/xor.o drivers/block/xor.c
  drivers/block/xor.c: In function `xor_block_pII_mmx':
  drivers/block/xor.c:586: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
  This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
  statements or clauses.
  cpp: output pipe has been closed
  make: *** [drivers/block/xor.o] Error 1
This compiles fine with newer compilers. (and works)

Dunno.. I suspect that sometimes its grey-cc -fuse-all-wrinkles ;-)
