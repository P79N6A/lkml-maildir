I currently have three Xircom RealPort Carbus modem/fast ethernet cards.
The current driver blows major chunks (it has very poor performance, and
stops working under load).  I'm told the driver issues are because of
hardware issues. The really nice feature of this card is the form factor
though.
3COM has a new card that has a form factor like the Xircom RealPort.  It
is the 3C3FEM656C card.  You and find information about it here:

I've been unable to find information about Linux support for this 3COM
card.
Is the modem a win modem, or a regular modem?  Is there any planned
support for this 3COM card?
