Subject: [PATCH] __VMALLOC_RESERVE export
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/27/132

__VMALLOC_RESERVE itself is not exported but is used by something that
is. This patch is against 2.6.9-rc2-bk11
This is required by the nvidia binary driver 1.0.6111
(2 long lines are being wrapped by my emailer)
