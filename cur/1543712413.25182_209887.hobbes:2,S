For me this is a policy issue.
I agree that huge requst hurt latency.  I just disagree that the 
_driver_ should artificially lower its maximums to fit a guess about 
what the best request size should be.
If there needs to be an overall limit on per-size size, do it at the 
block layer.  It's not scalable to hardcode that limit into every 
driver.  That's not the driver's job.  The driver just exports the 
hardware limits, nothing more.
A limit is fine.  I support that.  An artificial limit in the driver is not.
