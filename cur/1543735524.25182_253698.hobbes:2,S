I read it as "Let's bloat initscripts instead of the kernel". We 
probably have to bloat something, but we don't want to bloat our 
favourite kernel.
Maybe we should create a bash file with functions that implement it "the 
right way" and distribute this file with udev as an example?

We should probably avoid code duplication and put this functionality 
into a library (maybe even glibc?)
What we currently see is that distros either ignore the race or (like 
LFS) say something like:
"Because of all those compilcations with Hotplug, Udev and modules, we 
strongly recommend you to start with a completely non-modular kernel 
configuration, especially if this is the first time you use Udev."
