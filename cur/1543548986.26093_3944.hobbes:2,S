Some of the fields recently added to /proc/meminfo are very dependent on the
internal of the memory management of the kernel, I don't think it's good idea
to make them part of the user<->kernel API because there are alteratvive
algorithms that won't generate those numbers and that can generate different
ones. I understand the interest in collecting the new data for debugging
the behaviour of the MM but a few line of perl are enough to do that.
