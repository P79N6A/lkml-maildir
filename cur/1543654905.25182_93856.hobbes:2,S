I updated the BIOS to the latest (non-Beta) flash provided by
Fujitsu/Siemens but the BIOS offers no way to dsiable power-save stuff,
just the type of suspend it does (S1 or S3).

Funnily enough Gigabyte no longer carry the motherboard manual for the
GA-8STXCFS, only some of the other variants. Maybe I should take the
radical step and put LinuxBIOS on it but seeing as this is my works PC
maybe I should save that for a day when I don't have deadlines :-)
