There is still no new and definitely stable interface that allows me to
asume that it makes sense to put effort in implementing support for it.
The natural way to access SCSI is the method I use, ASPI uses and FreeBSD
uses..... If Linux likes to implement things differntly, they are free
to do so but the Linux authors need to learn that I don't like to spend my
time on somethign that might be useless next week. Also note that the fact that
the Linux kernel by intention hides information I like to see from interfaces that 
the Linux kernel authors like me to use makes it obvious that there is
no mind on a useful cooperation with me.
For me it makes sense to wait until I see that this attitide did change.
I am still interested in cooperation, but this needs to be done in a way that
does not start with calling me a novice programmer....
