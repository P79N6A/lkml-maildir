Ok, I see.
The taskstats's code is very clean and understandable, the only thing
I can't get is: why these listeners are per-cpu? It is very easy to add
'int exited_on_this_cpu' to struct taskstats.
Probaly this was done to filter out unneeded events (cpusets) ? In that
case it seems better to add cpumask_t to 'struct listener' but have a
single listener_array list.
Thanks!
Oleg.
