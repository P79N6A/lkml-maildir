Per user limits do not have to overcommit unless the total resources specified
is greater that what really exist.
Better to starve each other at the user level. If the user wants to overload
the system, at least the user is limited to his/her own processes.
And that is still better than crashing the system. (Besides, if you are
charging for usage, then you can make a case for more resources to upper
management, or the user must justify the load to upper management)
