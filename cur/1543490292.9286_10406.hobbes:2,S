STB has released a new card, called the STB Desktop TV.  It appears to be
a replacement for the STB TV PCI.
The card is a combo TV/FM card (Although it appears a TV only version is
available).  It is BT878 based (Which is weird, since the BT specs seem to
say that only 879 will handle the FM output).
It it based on a Phillips tuner (In my case, NTSC).
Getting the card to work with BTTV has thus far not been a problem.
Except sound.  The driver detects a TDA9850 sound chip, which I cannot
seem to locate on the board, and it never initilizes the sound.
Any plans to support this card with sound?  I'm more then willing to
provide information I can on the card and help, although my expierence
with kernel drivers is very limited.
