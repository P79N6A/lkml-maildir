Correct. And doing kfree(x); x=NULL; is not hiding that. These issues can still be debugged by
using the slab debugging options. One other benefit of doing this is that if someone tries to
access the same memory again using the variable 'x', then he will get an immediate crash. And the
problem can be solved immediately, without using the slab debugging options. I do not yet
understand how doing this hides the bugs, obfuscates the code, etc. because I haven't seen an
example yet, but only blanket statements.
But now I know better, since I haven't heard anything in support of this case, I have concluded
that doing kfree(x); x=NULL; is _not_needed_ in the "linux kernel". I hope that no one does it in
the future. And since people vehemently opposed this, I think its better to add another item on
the kernel janitor's list to remove all the (x=NULL) statements where people are doing "kfree(x);
x=NULL".
