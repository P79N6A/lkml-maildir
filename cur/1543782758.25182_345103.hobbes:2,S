Hi,
I will check code in several days, but I cannot re-produce a problem in a moment
because I am away from home for business trip.
In my understand, the driver recognize the CPU properly.

Can you try to check also follows?
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
With this driver, it will significantly slow down by setting powersave mode.
It seems some bus in the driver.
Thank you for report.
Hiroshi
