To be honest, we're not sure. See below.

MPS - Multiprocessor Specification? SMP? Yes, it'd be good to use the 
IOAPIC again.

Indeed, we skipped quite a few options. As mentioned before, the boxes 
are in production already so we don't have much time to play around and
we were just happy when they survived a few hours :(
But yes, we'll try booting with "acpi=off" and enabled IOAPIC again.
@Malte: when will we be able to do so?
Len et al., do you even suggest to use ACPI on a server system at all? I 
myself always thought of ACPI being evil and to avoid when possible 
(thus switching it off completely on a serversystem).
Since these NETDEV WATCHDOG issues seems to be a "known issue" (kinda, 
since the many postings on the lists in the past), is there something 
else we should look into? Would more debug .config options help to find 
out why they lock up?
Thanks for your comments,
Christian.
