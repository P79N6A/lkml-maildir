Exactly!
It seems to me that many drivers do not need a specific interrupt
handler, they simply use interrupts to wait until an event occurs.  I
think a simple, generic interrupt handler that simply lets you know that
an event occurred would be very useful.
Specifically in video drivers, one can do
	do {
		status = read_fifo_register() & mask;
	} while (!status); /* poll for fifo */
or....
	interruptible_sleep_on_irq (video_irq);
	/* FIFO is ready, proceed... */
Now I _could_ write an interrupt handler to do this sort of thing, but a
generic method seems much more useful, and keeps the code much, much
cleaner.  There might be a generic "register_generic_irq_handler()" step
at video driver init, if needed.
I hadn't thought about IRQ handling from userland, that _is_ an added
bonus.
Regards,
