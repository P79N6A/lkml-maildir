Dmitry's point is well founded.  Greg, I want to retract that klist patch 
(as536).  I'll send in a revised version before long.
It looks like the best approach will simply be to eliminate the driver's
list of bound devices altogether.  That should make Christoph happy -- no
klist, no list, no nothing!  :-)  The list hardly ever gets used, mainly
when the driver is unloaded.  We can already get the same effect by
iterating over the bus's list of devices and skipping everything not bound
to the driver.
This will eliminate a whole set of races and make the code more 
transparent (I hope).
