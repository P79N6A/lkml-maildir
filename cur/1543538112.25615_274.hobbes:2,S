You make sure to have a big box and run it in soft realtime mode -
it's still a lot cheaper than doing it hard realtime. And you are
actually likely to get more performance this way.
The places where I want to see HRT is mainly in control systems where
you cannot afford to ever skip a frame (ie. I don't want to sit on a
747 that suddenly does the BSOD or a powerplant blowing up).
