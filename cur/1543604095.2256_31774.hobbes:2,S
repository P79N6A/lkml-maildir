Hi folks
I recompiled my kernel with GCC 3.0.1 (was 2.95.x)
and guess what - it got bigger...
Somehow, I hoped in linux world software gets better
with time, not worse...
Maybe that's my fault (misconfigured GCC etc) ?
What do you see?
Being curious, I looked into vmlinux (uncompressed kernel).
I saw swatches of zero bytes in places, large repeateable
patterns etc. You may look there too in your spare time.
Especially informative are two pages (my console:100x40)
filled with "GCC: (GNU) 3.0.1". Does this gets into
unswappable memory when kernel loads?
