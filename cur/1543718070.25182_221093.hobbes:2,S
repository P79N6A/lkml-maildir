I believe kernel should userspace "button was pressed", and let
userspace ask it for suspend.

User should not manually do "echo something > /proc/acpi/sleep". For
embedded platforms, it should be rather easy to ensure user does not
do that, right?
OTOH, it might make sense to define that /etc/rc.d/suspend/* has to be
run before suspend and /etc/rc.d/resume/* has to be run after suspend;
by whoever who does suspend.
suspend-vetoing is pretty bad idea if your battery is running down. I
believe shutdown does it right: kill -15 -1; sleep 1; kill -9
-1. I.e. let apps know one second before suspend, but do not let them
veto it.
