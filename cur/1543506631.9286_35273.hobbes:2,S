I am developing a || device for linux.  I need to poll the status pins to
figure out if the device is ready to recieve data.  How do I wait in a
multitasking friendly method?  Right now I could
while ((count<3000) and (data!=BUSY)){
parport_read_status(parport,data);
}
but that is really nasty obviously.  From looking around I have seen
udelay() and mdelay() whats the diff and how do I use them.  Is there a
good source for this info that I missed.  What units are these in?  I
think I need around 1/200th of a second delay
