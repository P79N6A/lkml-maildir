Hmm.  I'm conflicted.
rename(2) manpage:
	Any other hard links to the file (as created using
	link(2)) are unaffected.
A change to ctime would affect the other links.
stat(2) manpage:
	The field st_ctime is changed by writing or by
	setting inode information (i.e., owner, group, link
	count, mode, etc.).
I am not aware of any field in the inode structure that must
be changed by an atomic rename.  Per documentation the only
reason rename should update st_ctime is if it does a
link+unlink sequence which would alter st_nlink briefly.
On the other hand it does seem to me there ought to be some
record that something about the inode changed.  st_ctime would
be the only appropriate indicator.
rename() SUSv3:
	Some implementations mark for update the st_ctime
	field of renamed files and some do not. Applications
	which make use of the st_ctime field may behave
	differently with respect to renamed files unless
	they are designed to allow for either behavior.
So reiserfs is on this point definitely standards conformant
already.  A change could at best be seen as an enhancement.
