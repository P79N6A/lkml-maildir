Right, I should have used the term "heartbeat" instead :)

OK, but still, if it is expected to expire, which this one is, then it
should be converted to a hrtimer, instead of a normal timer.  The hrtimers
were introduced to make it more efficient for expiring timers.  Well, they
really were introduced for high resolution, but in order to do that the
expiring timer implementation needed to be improved.  The timer wheel is
most efficient for those timers that are not expected to time out
(probably what a watchdog timer would actually do, so my terminology was
really incorrect).
The timer wheel is O(1) in removing and adding a timer, but can be O(n)
if the timers cascade (which would happen when a timer moves to expire).
The hrtimers are O(1) in expiring but O(log n) on adding and removing. So
they are better to use when you know that the timer will expire.
This also help's Ted's case for the -rt patch since the hrtimers there
have a dynamic priority.
