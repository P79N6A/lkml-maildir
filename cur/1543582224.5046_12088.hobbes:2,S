Dan,
No, I didn't say I approved of the patent.  I merely reported a bit of the 
when and what of the patent and said that that is no longer relevant, i.e. 
it's not a concern.
I don't approve of software patents.  I think the idea of granting software 
patents is a bad idea.  As programmers solving problems everyday, we are 
constantly developing techniques for dealing with new problems or finding 
new and better solutions for old problems.  This is a process of continuous 
invention carried out simultaneously and independently in many 
places.  Putting patent restrictions on this process is a bad idea.
