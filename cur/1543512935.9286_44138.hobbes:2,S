In 2.3, we can avoid a lot of the overhead by taking advantage of the
lazy-TLB features in the scheduler.  Basically you just put the thread
into lazy-TLB mode inside the sendfile syscall, and there will be no
hardware context switches when the scheduler runs that process until the
end of the syscall.

Yes, and in principle it would be possible to make the sendfile
completely asynchronous, essentially by doing the disk IO asynchronously
from a dedicated kernel thread.

A kernel-based async sendfile would be able to use that optimisation
automatically.
