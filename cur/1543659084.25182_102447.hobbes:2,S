Should I take it that 2.5.54 works? Or you haven't tested?

Ho humm.. Sounds like the non-PSE case is broken. Which should probably
mean that even newer CPU's should show the same thing if we boot with
"mem=nopentium". Can you verify that with your other machine that
otherwise boots the same kernel fine?

That's bizarre. Especially the fact that a _smaller_ kernel has problems, 
but a biger one does not.

That looks like a perfectly fine memory map, even if 28MB or memory sounds
a bit strange.
