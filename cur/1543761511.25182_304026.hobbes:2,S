Yes, you are missing something. The dm9000 is definetly
not an ne2k compatible, for a start it only uses two ports
(address and data), manages it's own transmit/receive queues, etc.
As the person who did the updates to Sacha's
original driver port, he should have really checked
with me for up-to-date version first, and to collect
a Signed-off-by: line.
