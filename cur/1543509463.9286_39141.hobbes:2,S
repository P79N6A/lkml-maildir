The rt signal queues default to 1024 and can be tuned by
/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max. This appears to be a system-wide limit and not a
per-process limit. 
The default system FD limit of 4096 and user FD limit of 1024 probably make
this just about enough for socket handling. If you are going to be using
15,000 connections, raise the queue size when you raise the fd size.
Now my question is, is setting si_band and si_value to the type of operation &
FD for RT signals portable? Unfortunatly, I can't find anything related to
this online (you'd think standards bodies would publish these things openly).
