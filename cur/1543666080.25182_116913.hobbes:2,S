I need the NetFlow data format, not something else.

NetFlow is not based on ASN.1.  It's a completely different format (an
industry standard which is implemented by quite a few vendors).

I fear the performance impact of copying all packet headers to user
space.

I'd like to see something which has virtually no impact on forwarding,
so that it's a no-brainer to enable it.  I doubt copying all the
packet headers to user space falls into this category.
