Subject: I'm really confused by kernel nfsd

I've been using user level nfsd for years (in addition to 10+ years
nfs experience on suns).
I recently upgraded to redhat 6.0 (2.2.5) and it wants to use
kernel nfsd...so I gave it a shot...
I haven't been able to find a good explanation of this nfs (the 
NFS server HOWTO in LDP covers user-level nfs...).  Also, there is
no docs in the kernel I've seen (in Documentation or the nfsd source).
Unless I've missed it badly, this is a major hole...
While the man pages and linuxconf supports link_relative, it seems
the kernel does not.
One of the most useful aspects of linux user-level nfsd is I could
export / in one shot...now, it seems I can only export one file
system per line...how do I export a tree of filesystems (if I can't, I'm
going to go back to user level nfs since this is too big a win...)
