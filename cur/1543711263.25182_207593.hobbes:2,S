I have connected two nics in the same machine with a null modem cable...
I have configured nic 1 to be 156.15.16.1 and nic 2 to be 156.15.16.2
I have adjusted the routes so that nic 1 routes to nic 2 and vice versa...
how come when I ping 156.15.16.1 it does not go out nic 2...
am I missing something?
Regards,
Mike
