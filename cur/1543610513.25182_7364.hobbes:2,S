Yes, it's good - no more symbol problems.
Currently running 2.4.15 plus the following:
 - the al viro fs patches
 - tux2-full-2.4.15-pre9-B2
 - 2.4.15-pre7-1-low latency.patch
 - preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.15-pre9-1.patch
tux is still insanely fast, I'll give it the dbench
test and the xmms and wolfenstein tests later -
;-)
