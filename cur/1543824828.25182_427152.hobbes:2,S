The killer problem I see with this approach is that it doesn't address
the divide and conquer problem.  If a task is capped, and forks off
workers, each worker inherits the total cap, effectively extending same.
IMHO, per task resource management is too severely limited in it's
usefulness, because jobs are what need managing, and they're seldom
single threaded.  In order to use per task limits to manage any given
job, you have to both know the number of components, and manually
distribute resources to each component of the job.  If a job has a
dynamic number of components, it becomes impossible to manage.
