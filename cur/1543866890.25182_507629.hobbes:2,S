Subject: [PATCH 3/7] cleanup: Make hvc_console.c compile on non-PowerPC

There's a really nice console helper (esp. for virtual console
drivers) in drivers/char/hvc_console.c.  It has only ever been used
for PowerPC, though, so it uses NO_IRQ which is only defined there.
Let's fix that so it's more widely useful.  By, say, lguest.
