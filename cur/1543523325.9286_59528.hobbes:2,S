With NFSv3 yes. v3 has some very nice ideas. One of these is that write
is a two phase operation. You do a write() you keep the data cached locally
and send it off to the server, later you commit old data and the commit is
allowed to fail forcing a client resend of the write. 
The benchmark numbers are probably bogus for real world situations as I suspect
either both or neither would cache normally
