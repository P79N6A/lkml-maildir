No there isn't.
The thing is, you should keep those "file-per-OS" files as small as 
possible, and only contain the things that are literally different. 
Because:

If the files only contain the actual differences, this just isn't an 
issue. Those files are per-OS _anyway_, so regardless of how you do it 
(with #ifdef's inside our outside the code etc), you'd have several 
versions.
And having separate files means that you don't uglify the code for another 
OS or another version and hide the _real_ issues.
But yes, it assumes that you can cleanly abstract out the differences.
