You ignore the fact these two NICs work as expected on 2.6.15 
and on 2.4.32 when e100 driver is compiled in, for the same 
hardware and test.

What further testing would you like?  Also, you ignore the all 
zeroes ifconfig accounting for the second NIC, and that the 
accounting was also accumulated to the first e100 along with 
interrupts.
Anyway the solution is simple: modular e100 is borked on 2.4, 
compiled in is okay.
Grant.
