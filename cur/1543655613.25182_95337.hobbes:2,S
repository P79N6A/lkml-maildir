	This is not due to the change that I submitted removing
driver_data from struct pci_dev, although it looks like a similar change
for isapnp devices.  I started to make a change to convert
the references to driver_data to
dev_set_drvdata(&isapnpdev->dev,...) and dev_get_drvdata(&isapnpdev->dev),
but got a little confused by the multiple classes of isapnp drivers:
	Driver structure	Device structure	ID structure
include/linux/isapnp.h:
	isapnp_driver		pci_dev			isapnp_device_id
	(none)			pci_bus			isapnp_card_id
include/linux/pnp.h:
	pnpc_driver		pnp_card		pnp_card_id
	pnp_driver		pnp_dev			pnp_id
	From ChangeLog-2.5.51, I see mention of isapnp changes
associated with Adam Belay.  So, I'm cc'ing him as he is probably
much better qualified to explain.
