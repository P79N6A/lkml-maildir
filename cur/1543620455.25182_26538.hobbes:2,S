Pfui! Think patches 1, 2, 3 in this order; with 2a later superseeding 2...

They do it in RPM's spec files, listing the patches (and saying if, and
perhaps when, in what order) they have to be applied. A source RPM is not
that much more than a cpio(1)-ball of the sources, patches, and .spec, very
handy a  _single_ file.
