The inability to prevent events from coming in faster than one can
process them does create an escape hatch so one doesn't have to handle
this case because it doesn't specify that minimum. Perhaps the
criterion for merging should be if some application is negatively
affected?
But I'm not convinced this would harm anything if merged beforehand.
It's also nice to exert explicit control over competition for memory.
