We were seeing this on a firewall a week or so ago -- it was actually
coming from some sort of arp flood/loop on the uplink not being caused by
us, and the speed of the incoming arp packets would cause these messages
to occur.
We tried ifconfig up/down, warm reboot, cold reboot, power cycle, card
swapping, and the messages continued.  We stopped the card with a 3c905
and the messages stopped, but "ifconfig" showed Rx overruns at about the
same frequency as the messages used to occur.  This is probably another
way to trigger this error than what most people are seeing.
