Conveniently, my alpha hit 48 days uptime a day after you guys found this.
Unfortunately, it seems the problem is more complicated than just the TCP
code.  I suspect that in many places in the kernel, time (in ms) is taken as
a 32-bit integer.  I experienced the following symptoms (kernel 2.2.2-ac7)
when I hit 48 days:
1) No network connections succeeded.
2) processes that I "visited" (i.e. went to xterm, typed something...)
spammed the CPU.  Load hit 10 very quickly, and it took about 10 minutes for
'shutdown -r now' to succeed.
I'll install 2.2.7 with your patch today, but in 48 days I'll be out of the
country and away from my computer.  I hope someone else can investigate this
further sometime around the middle of June.  ;)
Maybe some greps of the source tree for time calls?
