There is no way for userspace to do this. I thank you for your kneejerk 'it
is a userspace problem' report though - somebody has to do it.
Not very productive however. The kernel does not perform minimal services,
and gets confused to boot.
Now I'm all for offloading hotplug &c to userspace but when a device is
gone, people expect the associated devices to vanish as well, not linger
around generating invisible errors in dmesg.

Pray tell how I can do this from 'higher in the stack'. At least something
needs to happen, because now there is the possibility of lingering devices,
and I'm pretty sure we could get un-umountable mounts pointing there.
Thanks.
