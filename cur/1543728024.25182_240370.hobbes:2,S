I finally managed to boot the 2.6 kernel on top of FC1, but I can't run
jack with realtime priority, somehow the kernel is not happy with
something in the system, some jack client applications just hang. 
Anyway, running under 2.6 without realtime makes the numbers fluctuate a
lot more but I see the same effect. After a while freqtweak samples
decay to close to zero and it starts using a lot of cpu. Starting
hydrogen again (the drum machine feeding freqtweak in my tests)
immediately solves the problem. 
[some time later]
_BUT_ 
[frantically trying to find a big brown bag to hide in... sigh...]
I retested with 2.4.x under FC1 yet again and I do see the same
effect... argh... [*]

So, this is good in a way. I've been trying to find some code snippet
that would enable me to change the DAZ flag in MXCSR, without luck so
far... I know this is probably OT but would anyone out there know how to
do this, or where to find useful information?

[*] the test conditions in my two systems were not _exactly_ the same (I
should know by now that is bad), so that in the FC1 case the decay into
denormals was taking a lot longer. I have to learn to be more patient.
