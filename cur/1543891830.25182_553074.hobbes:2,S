I sent you the stats for:
- both lguest processes
- the bash which started lguest (which I suspect you don't actually
  want)
- the gnome-terminal that lguest was running inside of
  (keystrokes to the shell in lguest go through that terminal)
The last is probably not very interesting either, as gnome-terminal is
a single process with multiple windows and none of the other windows
were affected.
So I sent you everything but the stats for the CPU hog.
I suggest you try this yourself - lguest is incredibly easy to get up
and running. It's also quite useful: I can test-boot kernels with it
in less than a second, or about 10x faster than basic qemu, and 100x
faster than a real boot. And as it uses a pty as console, you can do
things like pipe it through grep.
You'll need the following tab-damaged patch for rc3-mm1:
