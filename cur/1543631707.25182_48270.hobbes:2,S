There is no garantee that this is precisely what will happen in the future.
What if MS threw a couple of millions at Victor to buy his patent (that's
not that far-fetched since Victor has shown a very clear intent to make
money off of his patent and since MS is clearly intent on crushing Linux)
and then said that all GPL uses of this patent are prohibited? What then?
