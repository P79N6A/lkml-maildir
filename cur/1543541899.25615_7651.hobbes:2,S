The last time I looked at XFS, it did not. It has the ability to hold
extended attributes, but no streams, no resource forks. Each attribute had a
limited size entry (64 bit value + name, I think). It also had a maximum
number of entries (256 or 512).
It DID have a user definable set of attributes, and a system defined
list (the user could NOT modify that list). The user set included
ACL entries.
Unfortunately, none of the backup tools would save anything EXECEPT the
ACL entries. see xfs_dump/xfs_restore for details.
