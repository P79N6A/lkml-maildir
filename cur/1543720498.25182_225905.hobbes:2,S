chroot_fs_refs() is OK - it's a part of pivot_root(2) and it's just as
"if process looks like the have root and/or cwd in old root, we assume
they want to have those flipped to new one; if they are not, assume
that they know what they are doing and wouldn't like us to pull anything
on them".  IOW, here we don't really care.
selinux open_devnull(), OTOH, is bogus - they already have an fs of their
own that is not going away; so why not put the damn device node on it and
be done with that?
In any case, BKL is irrelevant - that comment should've been dropped a long
time ago.
