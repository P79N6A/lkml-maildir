That particular convention only works if you have network namespaces and
UTS namespaces tightly bound.  We plan to have them separate - so for
that to work, each network namespace could have an arbitrary "prefix"
that determines what the interface name will look like from the outside
when combined.  We'd have to be careful about length limits.
And guest0-eth0 doesn't necessarily make sense; it's not really an
ethernet interface, more like a tun or something.
So, an equally good convention might be to use sequential prefixes on
the host, like "tun", "dummy", or a new prefix - then a property of that
is what the name of the interface is perceived to be to those who are in
the corresponding network namespace.
Then the pragmatic question becomes how to correlate what you see from
`ip addr list' to guests.
