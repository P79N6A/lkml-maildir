I'm trying to write a device driver (module) for one of my customers and 
have the following problem.
kernel veraion 2.4.18...
Memory is allocated (kmalloc) in the "open" call.
The above memory is used in copy_from/to in the "ioctl" (and possibly 
the read/write) call.
I understand that the copy_from/to may wait for pages to be swapped in, 
If the waiting process is killed at this point, is it safe to free the 
memory in the "close/release" call? If not, when is it safe to call  kfree?
