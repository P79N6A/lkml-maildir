What I found in the kernel code is that scheduler_tick is called from
two locations in the kernel (2.6.14-mm1) code (i386).
1) from kernel/timer.c in update_process_times which is called from
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c and its calling depends on the CONFIG_SMP
defined or not (see
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/arch/i386/kernel/apic.c#L1160
)
and as you don't have CONFIG_SMP enabled so its won't be called from
here.
2) from sched_fork function in kernel/sched.c
(
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/kernel/sched.c#L1414
) and I
think its called when newly forked process setup is going to be
performed, and I think as from here scheduler_tick is called in your
case, so you are getting different value for your variable tick_count
scheduler_tick might be called from somewhere else which I am missing
so please CMIIW !
