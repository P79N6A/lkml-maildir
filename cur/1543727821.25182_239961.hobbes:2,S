O E M (Original Equipment Manufacturer) software includes all essential
components of Microsoft Retail products excluding support from Microsoft.
Retail version comes in a fancy box, O E M does not. You will receive
installation CDs only (no original retail packing).
Although O E M software does not come with a box or a manual, it is the
typical and actual software, no trial or demo versions.
