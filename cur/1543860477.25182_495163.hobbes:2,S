I've seen some problems like this with kernels <= 2.6.19. But it is now
fixed since the following commit (merged in rc1 IIRC). The symptoms were
that it the interface was getting a strange name (something like
"eth0_tmp") when udev was renaming it with DRIVERS=="?*" in the rule.
See 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=389250.
 I removed
DRIVERS from the rule to avoid the problem, but the following commit was
definitely fixing the problem at this point. I didn't check again recently.

    Driver core: fix "driver" symlink timing
    Create the "driver" link before the child device may be created by
    the probing logic. This makes it possible for userspace (udev), to
    determine the driver property of the parent device, at the time the
    child device is created.
