Ah, silly me, I should have stated that this was a simulation burn on an
otherwise rather blank disc ;)

Yup, already was quite sure of that after having written the previous mail.
I'll try to verify this by simply removing all ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL calls ;)

HAL is /dev/host0/.../cd
cdrecord is -dev=0,0,0 (whatever Linux device file this translates into)
or a similar device ID as returned by -scanbus.
Probably (stating the obvious here, I'm afraid) we should only send
non-ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL for the *very first* device open,
and then send ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL after the *very last* device close only.
So you think that with sr and sg drivers both talking to the device,
proper inter-driver device tracking is not doable or quite difficult
to implement?

[OOPS output of a *different* issue]
Right, it's a rather incomplete OOPS. Let me try to get one with a nice
long-line VGA mode soon...
Thanks!
