I still need this anyway for I2O btw - I need to go from bus, slot, func to
pci_dev then to grab its resources.

It solves the problem for some devices, and makes them a lot cleaner
in their resource handling. It certainly cleans up code and tidies up
a lot of the potential for resource leaks in error cases.
Legacy resources need direct handling, special cases do too. No big deal
