Erm... the hoax "virus" was about writing to the first sector of the disk,
overriding the partition table. If "write data" is an "unknown command",

Hrm. I like the idea of being able to filter out dodgy commands from
hitting the drive: there's a difference between the Unix philosophy of
"enough rope" and the NT approach of everything having a landmine on top
with a big red button marked "press this and see!" :)
