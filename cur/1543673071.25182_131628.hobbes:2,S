I've used devfs for years.  A few people here and there gripe about it, 
my only gripe about it are drivers that don't [haven't yet] been updated 
to use it.  In 2.5 those are rare.  As to 2.4 vs 2.5, there aren't too 
many user visible changes and I think most of the new things for devfs 
(user visible) in 2.5 are also in 2.4.
My vote: devfs is _great_
