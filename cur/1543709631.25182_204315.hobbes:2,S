Yes.  But that a pretty low traffic mailing list anyway, and if really
you have to touch to cpufreq, even only for a single driver, you should
subscribe so that you know already of changes of cpufreq core which may
impact your driver.
For example, you may have a trouble with the new 'sticky bit' feature
with powernow-k8, especially if you want ACPI perflib included in your
driver.
