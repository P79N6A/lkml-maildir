You must only set PG_reserved or only increment the page count. If you
increment the page count, the kernel will try to free memory by removing
the page from the process and reread the page later by calling the
nopage function again.
If you have the pages allocated all the time anyway, it's better to set
PG_reserved, but these pages can only be freed again when all files are
closed. You probably also want to set VM_RESERVED in vma->vm_flags, so
the kernel won't even look at these pages, while scanning the process
for freeable memory.

Currently this lock isn't needed, since noone will remove or change this
mapping until you call vfree().
