I'm in the process of bringing my new Tyan Tiger MP machine online.
I compiled 2.4.18-pre9 (Athlon, SMP), and it seemed to go ok.  However, I get
lots of unknown symbol errors when booting.
insmod eepro100 gives:
unresolved symbol del_timer_sync
unresolved symbol synchronize_irq
The USB stuff didn't load either.
Is this a known problem, or do I need to give more details?
Thanks,
Ben
