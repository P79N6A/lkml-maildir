HID: Do not discard truncated input reports
Truncated reports should not be discarded since it prevents buggy
devices from communicating with userspace.
Prior to the regession introduced in 2.6.20, a shorter-than-expected
report in hid_input_report() was passed thru after having the missing
bytes cleared. This behavior was established over a few patches in the
2.6.early-teens days, including commit
cd6104572bca9e4afe0dcdb8ecd65ef90b01297b.
This patch restores the previous behavior and fixes the regression.
