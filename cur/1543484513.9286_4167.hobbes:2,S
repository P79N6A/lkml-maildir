The following kills XF86 3.3.3 xserver. 
I tried 3.3.3.1 version and it works, but x11perf locks it up - don't 
know whether it should be like this (bc of the load) or not.
Note that gimp and Mesa work ok in 3.3.3.1. 
I have a reproducible bug that kills Xserver (XF86 3.3.3). 
2.1.131: no bug
2.1.132: bug
2.2.1: bug
How to test - run any program that uses shm to access Xserver - it will
crash. Example:
x11perf -shm
Programs that won't work:  screensaver, gimp, MesaGL
  Xserver: 3.3.3 , Mach64
  cpu: AMD-K6-233
