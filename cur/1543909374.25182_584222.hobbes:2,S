-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Badari Pulavarty <pbadari@us.ibm.com>
Need to initialize map_bh.b_state to zero.  Otherwise, in case of a faulty
user-buffer its possible to go into dio_zero_block() and submit a page by
mistake - since it checks for buffer_new().

akpm: Linus had a (better) patch to just do a kzalloc() in there, but it got
lost.  Probably this version is better for -stable anwyay.
