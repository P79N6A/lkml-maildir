Subject: Promise fasttrack raid, changed disk, unable to boot.

Hello,
For the previos year i have been using the promise fasttrack 100 to controll 4 
disks. I mirrored 2 75gig drives and 2 80gig drives. Recently one of the 75 
gig drives died on me. This particular mirroring array was the system array. 
So i replaced the disk with an 80 gig one and duplicated it. Now i an unable 
to boot with the previos kernel 2.4.19. But i can boot with the 2.4.18 kernel 
which was provided to be by my distrabution. I have comiled 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 
on the machine itself and another machine to see if i could get one of them 
to work, but i can not. During boot up something like this is listed
ataraid/d0  then the partitions are listed. such as ataraid/d0p1
then the drives are listed
drive0 is 733XXX mb
raid0 consists of 1 drive.
That is how it looks with the new disk plugged in. But if i unplug it.
it will look like this:
drive0 is 733xxx mb
drive1 is 733xxx mb  <--- this tells me that there is something either in the 
kernel or in the system that is telling the kernel what the old disk used to 
be.         
I am completly lost and hope that someone else has an idea of what i should 
do. BTW I have compiled my kernel statically, while the distos 2.4.18 was 
modules, if that makes any difference.
Thank you,
Paul
