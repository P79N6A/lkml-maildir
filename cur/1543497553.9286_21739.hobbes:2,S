We've got a perfectly good and tiny romfs for initrd partitions if you
can cope with read-only.  That should be enough to get the XFS module
loaded.
It wouldn't be too hard to free the entire romfs code after you've
mounted the real partition, if you really care about the tiny amount of
space it takes.
