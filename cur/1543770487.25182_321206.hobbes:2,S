Porcelains and gitweb should play with each other nicely, but
the core should _not_ care by default.
An extra option ("--text", perhaps) to git-commit-tree is
acceptable to me, and it may be even a good thing to have.  It
would make life a bit easiear for Porcelain writers if nothing
else.  If that is to happen, I would say we could do more than
just leading blank line removal.  We can also remove trailing
blanks before each LF, tabify indented log message contents, and
remove empty lines before EOF.
