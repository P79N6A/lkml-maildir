  In the typical case where <256 pts devices are allocated, you're right that
there will be no benefit over the first-fit-from-zero implementation.  However 
when there are a lot of pts devices in use, the algorithm used for searching 
the high ranges ought to generally find a new pts in fewer iterations than
just linearly searching from 0 to the maximum pts number.  For example, if a 
system allocates 5000 ptses in a row, when it goes to look for a new one with 
first-fit-from-zero, that's 5001 iterations to find an available pts.  Using
the patch though, it will only take 257 iterations.  As time goes on and 
ptses get allocated and freed the situation becomes a bit murkier, but 
the patch should still cut down the number of iterations required to find
a free pts.
  Thanks,
  Steve.
