Hi Kristen,
I'm sorry for my late reply.
I understood the issue which you are encountered. When the
_STA is not defined, acpi assumes that the device is always
there. But actually, the device is not connected. So, when
the device is added, acpi_device structure has already exist.
Is my understanding right?
I've tried to solve this issue. But I could not find better
solution, unfortunately. So I think your idea is good now,
Thanks,
MUNE
