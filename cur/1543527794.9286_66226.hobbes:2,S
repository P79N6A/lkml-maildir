You may be right. The heuristic I described is a "first guess", but I hope
the idea (vary the "wait-time" based on behavior) is still feasible.

If the original timeout is exactly the time it takes to schedule(), this
might even be the wanted behavior: no overhead for "semaphore" behavior, and
sinlock-like behavior where possible....

The fast path (no contention) should, of course, never have anything to do
with this. I will keep thinking about a better heuristic....
