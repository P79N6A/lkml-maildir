-rmap is 2.5 stuff. 
I would really like to integrate -aa stuff as soon as I can understand
_why_ Andrea is doing those changes.
Note that people will _always_ complain about VM: It will always be
possible to optimize it to some case and cause harm to other cases.
I'm not saying that VM is perfect right now: It for sure has problems.

AFAIK Andrew's code simply adds schedule points around the kernel, right? 
If so, nope, I do not plan to integrate it.
