The only way a motherboard BIOS would know if the PCI BIOS used polling
methods instead of interrupt methods is if it was a built in device.  For all
non-built in devices, it can't assume it won't need an interrupt if the card
uses interrupts at all.  I find it extremely unlikely that there exists a
motherboard BIOS that *doesn't* at least assign the I/O space area and the IRQ
for all bootable devices on the system, regardless of PnPOS settings.  Name
one concrete example of a motherboard BIOS that doesn't and I'll recant.
