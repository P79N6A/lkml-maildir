|    cgroups: fix invalid cgrp->dentry before cgroup has been completely removed
|
|    This fixes an oops when reading /proc/sched_debug.
The above commit fixed a race that reading /proc/sched_debug may access
NULL cgrp->dentry if a cgroup is being removed.
But I found there's another different race, in that reading sched_debug
may access a cgroup which hasn't been completed created, and thus
dereference NULL cgrp->dentry!
cgroup_create()
  cpu_cgroup_create()
    register_fair_sched_group()
      list_add_rcu(...)
				print_cfs_stats()
				  for_each_leaf_cfs_rq()
				    print_cfs_rq()
				      cgroup_path()
  cgroup->dentry = dentry;
task_group is added to the global list before the cgroup has been created
completely, if at this time print_cfs_stats() is called, it will access
the half-created cgroup.
This patch fixes the bug by holding cgroup_lock() to wait the cgroup to
be created completely before calling cgroup_path().

The patch is based on linus's git tree, and should go into 2.6.28,
but it conflicts with the cleanup patch in sched/core:
