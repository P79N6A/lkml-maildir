Subject: [PATCH] i386: For debugging, make the initial page table setup less forgiving.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We just discovered that the accounting for initial memory usage
(head.S: INIT_MAP_BEYOND_END) has been way, way off for a very long
time.  This patch makes the initial page table not round up to the
nearest 4M boundary, but instead stop dead (and zero the rest of the
final page table) as soon as it hits the configured limit.
This patch is intended as a debugging aid.  If it goes into the
kernel, it should go in at the very beginning of a review cycle, as it
may very well expose real failures (without Jeremy's patch to fix the
accounting, it *will* crash.)
