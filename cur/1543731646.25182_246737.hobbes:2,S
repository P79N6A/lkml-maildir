Surely not - there is only 1 way to get to page_not_up_to_date,
and through that path you have already done that calculation and
none of the variables involved have been changed.
I think. Put a printk before your goto out, and if it triggers
then I am wrong.
What errors were you seeing with my patch? (If you applied my patch
to an -mm kernel without first backing out the others then it will
break).
