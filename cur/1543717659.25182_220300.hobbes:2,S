I'm the responsible party on that one.  do_cable_magic() was a direct
result of a significant amount of work with National's engineers to
root-cause some major problems we had had.
If I recall, the problem we experienced was when the cable was "short"
(where short was < 30m, I think).  What can you tell me about your cabling
setup?
Willing to test?  Ping me back.
