it appears that quirk is not even applied because PnP tells us device is not 
active:
[  571.118483] pnp: PnP ACPI init
[  571.118611] ACPI: bus type pnp registered
[  571.158828] quirk_smc_enable: active = 0
[  571.182090] pnp: PnP ACPI: found 12 devices
so this patch effectively did not change anything.
well, that's correct so far, it really is not active after system boot. May 
be, quirk should be applied when device is being activated, not when device 
is being enumerated?
