At least in theory an unclean shutdown is not going to cause any
problems, unless the hardware is screwy, in which case even a single
hard shutdown is going to cause problems.  I'm not sure that it really
makes sense to arbitrarily state that a hard shutdown is 5 times more
likely to cause problems.  We could make it be configurable, I
suppose, but I'm not sure it's worth it to add all that extra
complexity.  (Heck, we could also argue using a similar reasoning that
software suspends also increases the chances of filesystem corruption
"if something bad happens".  :-)
