Unfortunately, I respectfully disagree with Andries.  Until 
drivers/pci/pci.ids list is removed from the kernel source, I think we 
are best served by modelling EISA on PCI as much as is reasonable.

Well, I'm in favor of the patch.  Did Alan Cox have any special 
comments?  There isn't any special reason for the following, but I just 
have a general feeling that a thumbs up/thumbs down from him would be 
nice.  Alan?  Matthew Wilcox might be another good opinion to ping, 
because IIRC he occasionally runs into EISA in his rumblings too...
	Jeff, who would also like to see "sysfs stuff for MCA" too :)
