The converse is that pthreads are:
 - Very easy to use from C at a reasonable runtime overhead
It is very convenient for a userspace coder to be able to just start a
function in a different thread. Now it might be so that a kernel is not
there to provide ease of use for userspace coders but it is a factor.
I see lots of people only using:
	pthread_create()/pthread_join()
	mutex_lock/unlock
	sem_post/sem_wait
	no signals
My gut feeling is that you could implement this subset in a way that is both
fast and right - although it would not be 'pthreads compliant'. Can anybody
confirm this feeling?
