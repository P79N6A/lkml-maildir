Hugh,
I thought in a prior discussion with Andrea that there was a generic VM
i_mmap loop that can take rather a long time, and thus we didn't want a
spinlock for this, but a rwlock.  Since our critical regions in the
cache flushing are read only, only i_mmap updates (which are short
critical regions) take the write lock with irqsave, all the rest take
the shared read lock with irq.
Unless you've eliminated this long scan from the generic VM, I think the
idea is still better than a simple spinlock.
