No, this would cause a compile error if CONFIG_NET and CONFIG_SYSCTL is
enabled (because sysctl_net.c needs that declaration).
So the correct solution is apparently either one of
 - always declare an empty "struct ctl_table" regardless of whether SYSCTL 
   is enabled or not.
   This might be a good idea, since it probably allows more code to be 
   compiled without checking for CONFIG_SYSCTL.
 - put the ether_table[] declaration inside a #ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL.
Maybe somebody else has a stronger opinion than I do about which of these 
is the right solution.
