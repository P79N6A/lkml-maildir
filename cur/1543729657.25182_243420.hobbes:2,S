I receive the following errors on compile, after make has gotten through
building all config options:
-- SNIP --
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x398e): In function `do_nmi':

make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
-P2 and -P3 gave me the same errors except for
`smp_apic_timer_interrupt'.
I have tried my .config, default, allyes, and allno, and I get the same
result regardless of config.  Tree is fresh, patch applied with -Np1
<../[patchname].  I also get fuzz and offsets, but they don't seem to
bear on the problem directly.  I'm currently running -P1, which doesn't
have this problem.  gcc is 3.3.4.
With thanks for a smoother system feel,
