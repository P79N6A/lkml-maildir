The kernel will not wake up twice - once for 1.5 second and other for 3 second - it will wake up once at expiry of 3 second timer and execute both the 1.5 second and 3 second timers.

Quit top-posting!
If this is the case then the whole usage of round_jiffies() is bogus. All users of round_jiffies()
should just be converted to deferrable??  I am a bit concerned that if deferrable gets used everywhere
then a strange situation would occur where all timers were waiting for some other timer to finally
happen, kind of a wierd timelock situation. Like the old chip/dale cartoon:
 "you first, no you first, after you mister chip, no after you mister dale,..."
