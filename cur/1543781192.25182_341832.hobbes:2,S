And those of us who are Mac OS X oriented have patched our console and X
keycodes to match the mac way of generating symbols:
Alt-\        = «
Alt-Shift-\  = »
Alt-Shift-+  = ±
If only someone could come up with a good character palette like exists
on that OS, something that could generate a wide variety of keysyms,
preferably all of UTF-8, and send them to the topmost window.
