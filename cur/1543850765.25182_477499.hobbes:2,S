Umm...  What the hell for?  Both for struct initializer and for
compound literals all named fields that had not been mentioned
get initialized as they would for static objects.  So that's
simply adding more work to parser for no reason whatsoever.
There are only two cases when something is left uninitialized:
	* auto variable with no initializer whatsoever
	* padding and unnamed members
That's it.
