Hi,
when you request an IO port region, or an IRQ, you do it through a
specific function, which then logs the information in /proc.
This is very good, for example to add a new card without conflicts.
Now, is the same also happening with memory regions ?  For example
the RAM on an ISA card at 0xC8000 ?  Or BIOSes ?  Can we list
them all ?
Thank you for any idea.
