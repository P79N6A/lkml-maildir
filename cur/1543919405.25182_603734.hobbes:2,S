Hello,
my Kobil KAAN Professional (USB variant) smartcard reader stopped
working when upgrading from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22 (and 2.6.23). Not working
means that the latest libct.so supplied from Kobil is segfaulting when
trying to access the device. But as far as I can see the kobil_sct
driver itself didn't change from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22. Any ideas what is
going on here?
Thanks in advance. I will provide additional information if needed.
