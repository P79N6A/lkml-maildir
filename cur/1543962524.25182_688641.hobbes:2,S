The old method printed every value from stack which was in the text
range (you didn't get modules AFAIK). This might be the caller as well a
function pointer as argument as well something else. I tried to find to
find a pattern without frame pointers but I had no luck. I thing the
caller fixed the stack frame or something.
Greg did not complain about removing it. If you or others want the old
method in case of no frame pointers I can send a patch.

You mean by slightly that the first caller ORed the address with
something? In that case we don't return safely. I don't know how I could
find out the right time for a fallback (in case of slightly corrupted
stack).
