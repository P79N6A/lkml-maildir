Basically vma-based ptov resolution needs to be implemented for private
anonymous pages, which will require much less ZONE_NORMAL space overhead
as pte_chains may then be chucked.
Dropping physical scanning altogether would be a mistake esp. for boxen
of any appreciable amount of physical locality (NUMA, big highmem
penalties, etc.) or wishing to support any significant number of tasks.
