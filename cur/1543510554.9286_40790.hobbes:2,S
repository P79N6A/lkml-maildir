HI!
On my toshiba 4030cdt, bad things happen.
emacs images get corrupted in memory, c files get corrupted in memory,
and similar funny stuff.
cp emacs emacs-working
<flush in memory buffers>
diff emacs emacs-working
1740801 310 M-H    4 ^D
1740802 300 M-@   40  
It tends to happen when I play mp3's from internal ide cd on
background. [Grr, ray_cs radio cards somehow interfere with my
speakers. Perhaps toshiba's power supply is not stable enough? But it
happened even without ray_cs.]
I'm using maestro driver, which is marked experimental. Does it ring
any bells?
