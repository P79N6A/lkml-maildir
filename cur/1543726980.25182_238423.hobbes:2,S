Maybe I'm missing something, but in the 2.6 series, wasn't the ability
to mount subdirectories with different options, also, added?  Would
it be possible to export and mount /dev with rw options to a specific
client?
Or, more radical, if the roots of the clients end up being mounted RW
eventually anyway, why not specify 'rw' in the lilo option?  It's not
like it is a local filesystem that may be corrupt where one should
boot from it RO until it is checked...
But I've never tried either approach, so it's really only an 
idea/possibility.
Hope something works....the booting with a local initrd seems like it
would be a pain...
good luck,
Linda
