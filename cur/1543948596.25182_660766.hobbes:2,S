Yes, it can be made to work with even more extended VM changes than to
only allow invalidate_range to schedule. Those core VM changes should
only be done "by default" (w/o CONFIG_XPMEM=y), if they're doing good
to the VM regardless of xpmem requirements. And I'm not really sure of
that. I think they don't do any good or they would be a mutex
already...

I'm not suggesting not to address the issues, just that those issues
requires VM core changes, and likely those changes should be
switchable under a CONFIG_XPMEM, so I see no reason to delay the mmu
notifier until those changes are done and merged too. It's kind of a
separate problem.

DRI also wants invalidate_page by (mm,addr).
