True SATA drives ignore the "transfer speed",
as it really is meaningless and does not apply.
But most (all?) first-gen SATA drives are really
PATA drives with a SATA bridge built-in.
Some of those drives require that Linux set the
DMA transfer speed for them to work reliably.
Last I looked, the highest valid PATA transfer
speed was still "UDMA/133".  150 just plain
doesn't exist for PATA (and the whole concept
doesn't exist for SATA, so ..)
