IMO the latter makes much more sense (also for "net" case), but I doubt
you're willing to change current schema.
If you want to keep top level cleaner and avoid proliferation of entries
we might have:
subsys/sound
subsys/sound/drivers
subsys/net
subsys/net/drivers
and so on.
Clean and without ambiguities about stuff location. Unfortunately it's a
*big* change.
