Hello all,
I'm doing a project in linux, and I'm changing the driver of sym53c8xx (a 
SCSI board) to support Target mode. 
To receive data, we need 2 interrupts. One is for initializing all of the 
structures needed, and the second to send the data to the SCSI layer. What 
happens is that bettwen that two interrupts i can't start sending data, but 
in some cases that happen, and is beyond my control. To start sending data I 
set a bit in a certain register of the chip. 
What i would like to know is how can i to a kind of lock so that I set a 
variable in the first interrupt, and unset it in the second. If the SCSI 
layer trys to send data, I whant to stop before I set the bit of the chip. 
But I don't know how...
Can anybody tel me how to do it?
