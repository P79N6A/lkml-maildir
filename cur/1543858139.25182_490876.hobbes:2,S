No, as you have a specific type for this state, never test it against
"zero".  That just defeats the whole issue of having a special type for
this state.
So you should not have to change the values of the enumerated type for
the code to work properly.  In fact, I would argue that we should not
change it for this very reason :)
So, care to respin these without the enum changes to provide the new
function and use it?
thanks,
