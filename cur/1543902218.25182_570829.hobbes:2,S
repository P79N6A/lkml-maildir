I thought it was you who was saying that the restore operation requried 
ACPI if you used ACPI at all.

it has sounded like you are saying that if you support ACPI S4 sleep then 
it's incompatible with powering off.

yes there are limits. the fact that you can't remove the battery in S4 
mode without messing things up is a limit, the fact that it's against ACPI 
specs to boot another OS before resume is a limit. you seem to keep 
pointing out requirements of ACPI that limit what can be done. I do not 
disagree about these being requirements _if you are useing ACPI_, but if 
you don't need ACPI they should not limit you.

I wish I understood how you are saying this, becouse it does not match 
what I thought I have been reading for the last few days.
