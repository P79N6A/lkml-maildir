the 'compile in one place and export the product via nfs' mentality
really kicks in under *bsd, where you may have a server farm and want to
upgrade all at once...the tarball idea works for one machine, but for
multiples, its all about exporting it... just my 2 cents. --gabe

| The way I've always managed this sort of thing is to tar up your kernel source,

| steps except the "make modules_install" and the copying of the kernel image.

| skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete."

| had to do that stuff again. ;)
