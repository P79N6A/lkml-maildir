Suppose that the root of a iso9660 has entries such as '/', '.' and '..'
all with inode 2 and maybe that there are  some other indications that
the creator applied UNIX style inode numbering, wouldn't it be reasonable
to assume that inode numbers should be trusted?
In which case any wrong inode should be declared a bug in the program
that created the image?
A mount option to handle this could be useful as well.

No need to change that part, well, except maybe for knfsd if we cannot
safely export a CD-ROM but that's something I don't know.
It is annoying that wonderful zisofs backups need fixup scripts for the
hard links after a restore.
