Would it make sense for the subarchs to use the generic code where possible,
and only reimplement it's own (for eg) apic.c as and when it actually
*needs* to be different ?
For the most part, I'd expect the existing subarchs we know about
(sgi visws, voyager, numaq), the amount of "own version" copies of
files would be quite low.
The big advantage of doing it this way, is that it reduces the overhead
of having to update every subarch when someone changes function
parameters. The downside is possibly slightly ickier Makefile's.

Sounds quite logical. What does the current patches you have do ?
I've not had chance to look at them yet.
