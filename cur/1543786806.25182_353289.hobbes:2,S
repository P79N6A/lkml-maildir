Subject: [PATCH 00/21] mm: page fault scalability prep
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here comes the preparatory batch for my page fault scalability patches.
This batch makes a few fixes - I suggest 01 and 02 should go in 2.6.14 -
and a lot of tidyups, clearing some undergrowth for the real patches.
Just occasionally there's a hint of where we shall be heading: as in the
prototype posted to linux-mm a month ago, narrowing the scope of the mm
page_table_lock, so we can descend pgd,pud,pmd without it; and then, on
machines with more cpus, using a lock per page-table page for the ptes.
Thanks to Christoph Lameter for his generous endorsement of that approach.
This first batch is one half to one third of the work.  The next batch
should follow in a few days' time.  The long delay, mainly an odyssey
through the architectures to satisfy myself of safety, should be over -
though I still need to clarify some issues with maintainers, perhaps
by posting a few dubious arch patches.
This batch is against 2.6.14-rc2-mm1 plus Hirofumi's msync patch;
or against 2.6.14-rc2-git5 plus that and Nick's move_pte patch.
21/21 unfairly weights the deletions in the diffstat, without it we're
