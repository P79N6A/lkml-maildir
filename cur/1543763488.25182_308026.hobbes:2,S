Yes.  Bear in mind, however, that if these application threads are doing 
I/O over USB then they will be forced to wait for the bottom half to 
execute, regardless of its priority.

For most of the USB work it will be necessary only to insure that no more
than one copy of the bottom-half handler is running at a time, which I 
think the kernel does automatically for tasklets.  There are a few places 
where all IRQs will have to be disabled, but those places are relatively 
small and short.
Right now, of course, everything runs with IRQs disabled.

Okay.  It will be a while before the new code is ready and the changes on 
which it depends have gotten into -rc.
