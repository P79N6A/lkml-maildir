I really think this is the wrong way to go. Much better would be to fix
the X driver (are you using evtouch or something else?) to notice the
disconnect of the device (it'll get -ENODEV) and connect of the device
(a hotplug event is issued, a select() on /proc/bus/input/devices
returns as readable) and re-open the device.
It's not really possible to mix the events from all devices together,
namely touchscreens, since mixing of ABS_* events is undefined.
