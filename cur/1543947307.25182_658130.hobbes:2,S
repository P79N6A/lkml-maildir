If you are doing SG_IO to the sg device, then I know of one regression 
(well not regression exactly, but I fixed a bug but the patch got 
partially overwritten by another patch and that caused a new bug). Both 
bugs are fixed in 2.6.25-rc2. Could you try that out if you are doing 
SG_IO to the sg device.
