The first one, for the top50 was a normal config for a qemu machine, not
sure right now if there was debugging, it may well be the case, the
second one, for a top100, as said in the message was with 'make
allyesconfig', as I was testing how scalable was the thing in the
current state, and as David Woodhouse and Adrian Bunk said it is
unrealistic, best thing is to built it with the config distros ship +
debug info, which I'll do in the next few days.
