I'm not subscribed
( tried that once, and couldn't use that e-mail account again, due to swamping )
so please cc me to replies, if you feel I might help further. . .
circumstance:
openSUSE 10.3 x86_64 ( on an X2 ), 4GB RAM, 4GB swap ( some apps do go bonkers, sometimes ) on /dev/md0 ( raid-1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 )
/boot/grub/menu.lst

I couldn't get swap to activate on /dev/md0
when the "resume=..." bit was in there, and
I couldn't get mdadm to stop /dev/md0
( btw, the manpage for mdadm is wrong, at least in syntax, on opensuse 10.3 )
it complained that the thing was still in use, but nothing in /etc/fstab was identified as being on it
( I'd commented-out the swap line, to minimize complexity ), and I couldn't find anything else that seemed to be using it.
lsof | grep md0
md0_raid1 2283 root cwd DIR 9,2 4096 2 /
md0_raid1 2283 root rtd DIR 9,2 4096 2 /
md0_raid1 2283 root txt unknown /proc/2283/exe
Then removing that "resume=..." from grub's menu.lst bit fixed swap.
/dev/md0 /could/ be activated as swap, then, and /dev/md0 behaved as a normal raid device, being stoppable & runnable.
I *need* this machine to be redundant-everything, very-very-reliable, because it's going to someone who can't geek, and they need it to work.
( which is the reason I'm not permitting MS-Windows anywhere near the metal )
Presumeably the resume stuff wasn't /intended/ to require a non-raid-1 partition if it is to co-exist with swap, 
I think it was an oversight, 
but maybe it's impossible?
My current "solution" is to rip all suspend/hibernate system/sw from this machine, to prevent any problems with the system "assuming" that the resume-data exists.
Please get the fixers to perceive the problem, if youse can, & thanks in advance, eh?
