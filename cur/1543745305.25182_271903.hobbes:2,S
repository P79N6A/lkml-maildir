Hi!
please send netfilter/iptables related questions to the respective
lists:
	netfilter@lists.netfilter.org (for user questions)
	netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org (for development issues)

This is correct.  iptables is a IPv4 packet filter.  It is part of the
IPv4 stack.  tcpdump uses PF_PACKET which attaches right above the
NIC driver, therefore you capture packets way before they enter the IPv4
stack.
