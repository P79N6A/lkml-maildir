Subject: [PATCH] Remove all register pops before sysexit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch, which depends on the previous %ebx -> %ebp patch, removes
all pop instruction in the sysenter return path.
This leaks the thread_info address to user mode but this shouldn't be
a security problem.
This is what happens to the various registers:
%eax: return value from system call: already in place
%ebx, %esi, %edi: saved by the C compiler
%ecx, %edx, %ebp: restored by user mode
%esp, eip: copied to %ecx/%edx and restored by sysexit
%ds, %es: initialized to __USER_DS on kernel entry
%cs, %ss: restored by sysexit based on msr
%fs, %gs: not modified by the kernel (saved around context switch)
eflags: not preserved
FP, XMM: any code that modifies them must save/restore them
Note that while it is possible to change %ebx, %esi, %edi, %ecx, %edx
or %ebp via struct pt_regs, anything that does should set TIF_IRET or
another work flag (and it hopefully already does).
