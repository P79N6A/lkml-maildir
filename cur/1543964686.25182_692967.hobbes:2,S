I assumed here that idr_remove_all() was called in the "typical cleanup 
sequence" mentioned in the comment describing the routine.
And actually, that's how it is called in drivers/char/drm.

I didn't use rcu_dereference here since the caller should anyway 
serialize with other writers. So the tree should remain unchanged during 
the replace operation.

That would be kind, indeed (hope I didn't break anything).
