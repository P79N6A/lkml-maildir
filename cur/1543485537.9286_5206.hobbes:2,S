	I know Windows98 (I don't know about Win95) has an option to
use digital transfers to play CD music.  With the digital option
enabled, the sound data goes through your IDE/SCSI ribbon cable, and
not through the CD audio cable, as it does in Linux.  Therefore it
COULD be a cable and/or CD-ROM fault.
