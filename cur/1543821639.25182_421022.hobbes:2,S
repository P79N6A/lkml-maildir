Bad wording there.  Last September I submitted patches to split out
the driver core and the hardware-specific parts into separate source
and object modules ... the core was always separate from the parts
applying to specific hardware.  (As you know, since you adopted that
approach for your ASIX code.)  What changed was the "one big file"
model, which had stopped making sense.
