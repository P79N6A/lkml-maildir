Some SPI flash chips are rated at 60 MHz ... there's no "official"
standard placing such limits on SPI.
The various IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) transceivers seem to take up
to 10 MHz clocks, FWIW.  USB controllers, 12 MHz (surprise!  they
are of course full speed, 12 MHz).
Sensors with A-to-D converters are often lower rate; only 100K
samples per second, say, at maybe 12 bits each; more like 2 MHz.
