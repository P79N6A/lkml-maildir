yes.. just tested on my emulation box with some patterns, including patterns in
hot-add-failure report.(very small chunks in one section, and very big contiguous
memory hot add and unaligned memory hot-add.)

I think this patch fixes serious problems. This patch can enlarge memory-hot-add
supported hardware. And fast-track paths sounds attractiveto me.
But I want more tests and reviews.
