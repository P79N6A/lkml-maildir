I'm generally skeptical to the kind of "cleanups" that you seem to be 
referring to.  More often then not they reduce legibility instead of the 
opposite.

If checkpatch considered that line to be a problem, I would consider 
checkpatch to be utterly broken.  That line is perfectly legible, and 
padding in a bunch of spaces would make it LESS so, especially since it 
would have to be split between lines.
