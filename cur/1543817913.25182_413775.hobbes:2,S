If I thought your change was appropriate for 2.6.16 I would have put
it into that tree back then.  Instead, I did not consider it
appropriate, that's why we decided to put it into 2.6.17
Nothing since then has changed the situation.

I think it's too risky.  It fixes a panic for infiniband.
I think you should not have submitted such a core networking change to
-stable without passing it by netdev CC:'ing me first.
