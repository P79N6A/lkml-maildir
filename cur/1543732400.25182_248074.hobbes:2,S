Yep.

Right now no, because when Samba refuses the stream open, Word falls
back into a "tar"-like mode where it linearises the streams into the
data (it's a legacy mode for storing data on a FAT drive, not an NTFS
drive). However, the problem is that no currently supported Microsoft
OS doesn't have streams-capable NTFS support. 
This means that in a future MS-Office revision, this backwards support
may be broken by accident or by design (less likely, Microsoft really
don't do that kind of thing without very high level requests :-) and no
testers at Microsoft will notice (because they only test against MS servers).
