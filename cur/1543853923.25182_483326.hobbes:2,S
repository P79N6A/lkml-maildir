There are two ways of capturing branches on the Intel processors (I have not
looked at AMD): Last Branch Record (LBR) and Branch Trace Store (BTS). The former
stores from/to information into MSRs and is very small (4 branches). The later could
be as big as you want. On recent processors LBR and BTS can be constrained by priv level.
The issue is that they capture ALL taken branches, not just taken function call or return.

Yes, I think it could be used for debugging, you'd need to reserve a few pages
and initialize a single MSR (32_DEBUGCTL).
