Thanks.

It looks reasonable to me, from a ten-minute-scan.
Well.  All architecture ports suck.  Yours sucks averagely ;)
The todo list of which I'm aware is
- use serial core in that driver
- Fix up that ioctl so it a) doesn't sleep in spinlock and b) compiles
- Use generic IRQ framework
- Review all the volatiles, consolidate them in some helper-in-header-file.
- Sort out maintainance issues, gather signed-off-bys. (Done, it appears)
More things might come out once people start paying more attention, but if
that's the extent of things, I'd be OK with a merge when you're ready.
