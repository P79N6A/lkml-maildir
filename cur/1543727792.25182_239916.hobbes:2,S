This is not the first report of an rmap.c:407,
Denis reported one a week ago (on 2.6.7-bk20).
I don't know what's behind it, but I am wondering if PageReserved
might be getting cleared while page is still mapped into userspace.
You both have sound modules in, are you using audio?
Could you mail me (privately) your /var/log/messages, Oskar, I don't
have a clear picture of the relation between your page_alloc.c:792s,
your rmap.c:407s and your other oopses.
Thanks,
Hugh
