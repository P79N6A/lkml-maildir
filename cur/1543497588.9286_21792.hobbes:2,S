ISAPnP isn't really related. There is btw some very nice clean ISA PnP
handling code in the ALSA sound project. It just does ISAPnP, and it just
does what it needs to.

You need to be able to ask "is anyone on this IRQ line". The current code
answers "is anyone currently listening to this IRQ". That isn't the same
