Thanks, this one looks good. I have this nagging feeling that the test for 
"every second" should be doable by using a multiply (ie do a
secs_to_cputime(secs) and see if it's smaller than "total - cputime") 
rather than doing the divide that is implied by "cputime_to_secs()", but I 
can't really bring myself to care, and if anything, that test for "did we 
go into the next whole second" really is pretty obscure anyway.
So I can't see anything wrong with this. Anybody else? Going, going..
