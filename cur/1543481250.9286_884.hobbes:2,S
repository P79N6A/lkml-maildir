Have you tried to compile, profile and then recompile with the profile info fed
back to the compiler ?  I think such a 3-step process is what Philipp Rumpf
had in mind when he said:
    I think a lot of the goto's could be removed as soon as there is a decent
    possibility to tell the compiler to optimize for a certain case. This was
    discussed on the egcs lists some time ago IIRC.

MIPS and Alpha don't have `flags'.  But I still agree that it's most of the
time cheaper to check against 0 than against any other value.

I believe the problem of stack allocating such loop variables is fairly
specific to register-starved machines such as the i386.  And the `extra code'
is also fairly architecture dependent.
