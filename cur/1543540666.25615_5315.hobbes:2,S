Folks,
Yesterday morning I posted a message that I was not being able to put ADS
Cadet Radio card working on 2.2.16 and also 2.4.0-test5. Yesterday night,
Russell Kroll e-mailed me a patch for 2.3.x/2.4.x which has detected the
card perfectly. I think it worth to be applied on 2.4.0-test6 (I've tested
on 2.4.0-test5).
Here is the URL

Thanks Russell!
