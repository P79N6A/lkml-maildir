The idea is _not_ to register them on boards that only have a
single RS232 connector.  The fix was just having the 8250 code

That is, there's no third way which (a) doesn't waste that memory,
and (b) doesn't produce annoying messages about non-error cases?
ISTR that having NR_UARTS bigger just produced different messages...
