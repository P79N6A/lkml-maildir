I forgot to include a url in my last email. Sorry about that. 
Here is the document I was working from:
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/solrhe/Securing-Optimizing-Linux-RH-Edition-v1.3/chap6sec72.html
one point about this in particular is the fact that this document
recommends 256 FDs for every 4M ram. I'm running a Dell 6650 with 8GB
RAM, and well, adhering to this would mean I must allocate ~500M FDs. 
That seems too high for *proper* operation to me. Is there a better
method to use?
