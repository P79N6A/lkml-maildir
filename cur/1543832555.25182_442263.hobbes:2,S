Perfect, this is exactly how I hoped it will be done in the end.  Very
nice massaging of the generic code without runtime impact on older filesystems
or code duplication.  Thanks a lot Vladimir!
Now before we can put this into mainline we'd need some in-tree filesystems
to make use of it.  I've cc'ed the usual suspects for this..
p.s. you mail setup seems a little odd.  any chance you could just inline
the patch normally instead of using mime?
