udev rc script reads:
# chkconfig: 2345 20 80
If it is supposed to create device nodes on an empty /dev, I think it should
be run at runlevel 1, or even run apart from normal initscripts, from rc or
the like ?
For example, on a Mandrake cooker box, rc2.d looks like
K05portsentry@  K35dhcpd@       K80gmond@                   S12syslog@

This means that it will try to run, for example, gpm before the device for
the mouse is created (as I said, if you booted with an empty /dev you want
to populate with device nodes).
And a couple questions.
a) Should not ordering be reversed here:
  start)
    if [ ! -d $udev_dir ]; then
        mkdir $udev_dir
    fi
    if [ ! -d $sysfs_dir ]; then
        exit 1
    fi
  If we have not /sys, there's no sense on creating /udev, so I would check first
  for /sys.
b) What is the sense of removing devices when udev is stopped ? As I understand
  it, udev is not 'running', it is just a command to create device nodes, called 
  by hotplug. What is more logical, chkconfig --level 12345 or --level 1 ?
  One more reason to split it from normal init scripts. 
TIA
