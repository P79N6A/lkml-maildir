The original dos case was timeout based.  They sat down and changed the disk 
as fast as they could, and worked out it took something like two and a half 
seconds to swap disks.  So if subsequent accesses were within two and a half 
seconds and got valid data on the first attempt, they decided it had to be 
the same disk... 
These days with the button it's probably more like a second and a half, but 
the principle's the same.
Also, enough drives do it right (the vast majority), that a 
"broken_disk_change" module/boot option seems more sensible as a non-default 
thing for those that really are hosed...
