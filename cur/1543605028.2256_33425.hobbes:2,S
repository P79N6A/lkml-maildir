I've not reached any final conclusions on the VM - there are things that
Rik's VM shows up that look like the VM algorithm is right but it triggers
other stuff, and there are a couple of hackish bits left in still.
Smart is often good - especially given how slow disk seeks are. But smart is
not always best for any algorithm.
