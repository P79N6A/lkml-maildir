Thanks to everyone who replied.  Holding down the Alt key instead of the 
SysRq key does indeed make everything work well.

In this case it's not all that bad, because Alt-SysRq is used only by a 
relatively small community of developers (it is a debugging tool, after 
all).
Changing well documented behavior wouldn't be so bad if the changes were
also well documented and easily available for perusal.  Perhaps there
should be an area on www.kernel.org devoted to listing the new features
and changes added by each kernel release.
