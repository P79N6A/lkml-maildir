Hi,
 I am writing a device driver:
 In the probe function i have to give a parameter struct
platform_device * pdev.
 when is the probe function called?. It is not called at
initialisation time (module loading)
 suppose i have a situation where in i need to probe when the module
is inserted how do i do it?
 is it possible to get a struct platform * in the init function of the
driver?.
 Is there any call to get a struct platform * ?
 Also i want to know if it is possible to get a struct device * frtom
any call. i need a struct device * call some functions.
 How do i get it?.
 I know if the upper layer (could be kernel generic code) calls my
driver probe function - it passes a struct platform * or struct device
*.
But, is there any call to get it calling from the init function.
If so, how ?
Please advice,
Regards,
sriram
