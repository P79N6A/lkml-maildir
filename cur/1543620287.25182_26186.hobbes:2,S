It's only a problem if this is the final put_page().  In the
case of sendfile(), process-context code can be taught to take
a temporary reference on the page, and only release it after the network
stack is known to have finished with the page. sendfile is synchronous, yes?
And in the case of all other skb frees, the underlying page
won't be on the LRU.  I hope.
