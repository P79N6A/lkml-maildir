Instead of all this gymnastics, how about:
1. If using Px states, state is unknown until first "set" event.
2. Implement priorities for time source selection and a generic timer API.
This gets around the need to get the clock rate correct to have system
timers work.  On FreeBSD, this is /sys/kern/kern_tc.c
