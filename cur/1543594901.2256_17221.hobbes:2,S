I think your mail is offtopic for linux-kernel: it doesn't mention Microsoft or user space
java programming or pointer to random unrelated web pages, but an actual kernel bug.

I think it would be better if the low level module stays locked also while the 
control fd is open. That would match the semantics of most other devices.
Right fix probably is to call ->lock twice in loop_set_status()
[Also the locking is not SMP safe, but that's a different issue, for the e.g. ->lock
would need to be replaced with a struct module *owner and also some other locking]
