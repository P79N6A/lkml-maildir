Ok, somebody make an executive decision then.  As it stands, the driver
_does_ work.  Everyone understands it needs the cleanups that Christoph
has mentioned, and those of us who work on it certainly will keep
cleaning it up to hopefully match Christoph's expectations.  Some of
that has already been done in upstream git.
So, either we push it off until 2.6.23, or it gets merged as-is and we
clean it up as we go along, which we'll certainly do.
