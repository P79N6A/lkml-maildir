Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: why does kconfig hate?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is the obvious fix attempt for people updating their .configs and not
getting the i915 driver any more, or people not selecting FB and not finding
it as an option.  We want to just enable the code needed to build the driver,
not force the user to go find the option to enable it, because they really
don't care.
However, with this patch, the build results in:
drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:8:error: found recursive dependency: DRM -> <choice> -> DRM_I915 -> FB -> FB_I810 -> AGP -> DRM
and I need some help interpreting this.  In particular, how do these two
dependencies get produced:
FB -> FB_I810
AGP -> DRM
as they seem to be backwards (DRM results in AGP being required, FB_I810
results in FB being required).  If I remove this wonky bit from DRM:
 menuconfig DRM
        tristate "Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support
-       depends on (AGP || AGP=n) && PCI && !EMULATED_CMPXCHG && MMU
+       depends on PCI && !EMULATED_CMPXCHG && MMU
then it still produces:
drivers/video/Kconfig:23:error: found recursive dependency: FB -> FB_I810 -> AGP -> <choice> -> DRM_I915 -> FB
