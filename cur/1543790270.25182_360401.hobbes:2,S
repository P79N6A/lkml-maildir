I haven't responded yet, because I didn't have the time to verify and test 
the problem yet. It's not "seriously borked", it doesn't crash, it still 
works and the problem is easily fixed by fsck, so it wasn't on the top of 
my todo list.
The patch looks fine, although I'd probably prefered to move this kind of 
initialization into a separate function, as it's duplicated right now.
bye, Roman
