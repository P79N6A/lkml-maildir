OK, let assume your perspective of the history is the valid and real one, 
then, ¿where are all lawsits against other big GPL only projects? For example 
libqt/kdelibs. You can hardly provide any example where the GPL wasn't hold 
in court.

"Fair use: The right set forth in Section 107 of the United States Copyright 
Act, to use copyrighted materials for certain purposes, such as criticism, 
comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. The Copyright

determined by balancing these factors: ..."
According to the law, I don't see how FSF tries to avoid or to reject the fair 
use rights.
It seems to me you provides us with a copyright law interpretation supported 
only by the very [narrow] exceptions of the copyright law, a logical fallacy.
