Seems to be the same or at least related.
On comment about my first mail: this is the correct code of condvars, 
despite what I wrote before.  I wasn't thinking clear.  The internal 
futex is a normal futex.  It is the job of the CMP_REQUEUE_PI call to 
figure this out, select the waiter with the highest priority, and boost 
the priority if necessary based on the targer futex which always is a PI 
futex.
