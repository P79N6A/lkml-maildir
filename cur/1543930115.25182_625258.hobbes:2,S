It's just that the only device driver with XIP support for the moment is
s390 (and an obscure powerpc one).
Now with my ramdisk patch, anybody can use it. That's just using regular
RAM, but there is nothing preventing XIP backed by more exotic storage,
provided the CPU can natively address and execute from it.
