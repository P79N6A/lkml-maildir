Hello Linus,
Linus, Ingo, I've got one strange CPU bug leading to oopses, reboots and 
so on. This bug can be reproduced with a little bit modified 4gb split 
and is probably related to CPU speculative execution. I'll post more 
information about this bug later, but I would like to ask you for Intel 
guys contacts who maybe interested in this information, so I could CC 
them as well.
Thank you,
Kirill
