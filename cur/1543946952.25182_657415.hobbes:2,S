Ingo,
I was looking through nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/pthread_yield.c in the glibc
sources and it looks like pthread_yield() calls sched_yield(). Applications
using compat_sched_yield and pthread_yield() are also going to be impacted.
I searched for pthread_yield and sched_yield using google codesearch to look at
the applications that use these routines, the search list is too big for me to
mark applications as candidates for potential improvement.
