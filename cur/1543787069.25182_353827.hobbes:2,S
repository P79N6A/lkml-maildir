Summary for Andrew Morton:
ondemand's ignore_nice attribute has a reversed meaning, and fixing this 
requires changing the API for the user playing with sysfs. Thus, it should be 
fixed ASAP, i.e. 2.6.14.
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice
Then ondemand ignores nice tasks when calculating CPU load.
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice
Then ondemand considers nice tasks when calculating CPU load.
It's the reverse of the expected behaviour, even Alexander Clouter got 
confused on it when I first reported this bug.
So I suggest:
*) to flip the flag's behaviour, as discussed with Alexander
*) to rename the flag to ignore_nice_load or ignore_nice_tasks, to avoid 
burning the user too much. Very few people use it now, but let's help them.
*) Alexander had a piece of doc he wrote about all this and sent me, it'd be 
nice to have this merged too.
Alexander (quoted near the end) said to have rolled the patches, but they're 
lost somewhere, don't know if he forgot or they're in some staging tree 
in-the-middle. I guess I could roll up the patches if needed, but this week 
I'm really busy, so probably not. I've also forwarded the original docco 
patch to Andrew Morton and LKML (which didn't receive them in first place).
