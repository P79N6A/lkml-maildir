Indeed. And also misses the point - the point being that we don't actually 
need to freeze anything at all most of the time. There's nothing wrong 
with making memory allocations etc.
And yes, suspend is different from hibernate. I can see how hibernate 
people are worried about people writing to things after doing the 
snapshot, but those concerns don't exist with suspend. With suspend, the 
biggest concern is accessing a device after it has been suspended, but on 
the other hand, also the fact that we end up having driver writers used 
to the system being "runnable", so they do things that really do require a 
full-fledged system (and sometimes that means just some delayed action 
using a kernel thread, other times it seems to rely on more complex 
behaviour like firmware loading :^p )
