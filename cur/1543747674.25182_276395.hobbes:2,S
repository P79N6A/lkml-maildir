It's all over the map:
Large-systems performance & scalability.
Embedded.  Desktop issues.
Journaling + extents-based filesystems.
Drivers (new development in Infiniband and iscsi).
VM fixes.  Processor scheduling improvements.
IO scheduler improvements.
Fixing bugs.  :)

There are by some projects, others are more informal and
just discuss TODO on a mailing list.

a. scratch your favorite itch
or
b. what someone pays for
What do you want to work on?

Of course.  But part of the Linux culture is that
ideas/suggestions don't carry much weight.  It's
sometimes phrased as:
   Shut up and code.
or
   Show us the code.
so send patches too.  :)
