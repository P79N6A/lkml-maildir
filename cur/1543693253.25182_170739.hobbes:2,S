Hi,
In previous message you pointed out that the help for CONFIG_SHAPER
mentions 
ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/
 as the location for the
configuration utilities. 
CONFIG_NET_RADIO section also mentions it as a place for "Some user-level
drivers for scarab devices which don't require special kernel support".
That host does not exist anymore though.
Anyone knows the new location, if there is one?
