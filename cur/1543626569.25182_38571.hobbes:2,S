It has been discussed on this list several times.  In fact every time
this has come up.  There are a lot of policy decisions the in kernel
dhcp/bootpc code that are generally best left to user space.  
Al Viro has gone so far as proposed moving a lot of other parts into
user space as well.  But initramfs needs to be in the kernel for that.
