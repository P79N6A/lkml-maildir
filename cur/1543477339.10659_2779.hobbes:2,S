   My experience with ALL lists hosted on vger suggests that 36 hours is
   the standard...
I must admit that this is becoming a pain, but it's a circular
problem.  This list seems to be getting bogged down by about 10 people
reporting each compilation failure (for example, when a #define is
accidentally omitted).  If there weren't such a huge lag with the
list, people would see the first report and not bother to report it
again. 
So, we get more traffic on the list because it has a slow turnaround.
And yes, I do realise that this list has some very special problems
due to the quantity of traffic and number of subscribers.  Maybe we
need a separate "it doesn't compile" list hosted elsewhere to deal
with this specific type of problem.
*Please* reply direct to me, and not the list.  There's enough junk on
the list already that doesn't belong.

400 mails from linux-kernel so far today, and I'm getting very behind.)
