Yes. What I've meant by "always" is "at each caracter received". It equals
zero for everyone of them.

Do you mean that it's impossible for the tty_ldisc to know the size of what
the serial port received ? As I've told before, I've got no other way to know
it, so it's necessary to me (moreover, I'm trying to port an existing driver
from Windows to Linux, and the Windows serial driver gives accurately the
size of each PDU, so there must be a way).
