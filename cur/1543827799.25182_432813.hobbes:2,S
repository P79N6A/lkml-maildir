AIUI, many modern webcams export their data as jpeg streams.
Existing userspace expects the kernel to feed it raw data.
To keep existing userspace working, the out-of-tree drivers (such as ov5xx)
are doing format conversion in kernelspace so that the stream now goes..
camera -> jpeg -> kernel -> raw -> userspace
in-kernel format conversion is somewhat nasty however, so the
out-of-tree drivers seem to be staying that way.
