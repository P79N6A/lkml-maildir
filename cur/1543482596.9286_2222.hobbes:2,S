If you just upgraded from 2.0. be warned that the ordering of /dev/lp*
has changed.  This is documented in Documentation/Changes.  It used to
be based on the io address of the port.  Now it's based on the order
that the ports are detected.  I'm guessing you were using /dev/lp1, and
the printer is now showing up on /dev/lp0.
