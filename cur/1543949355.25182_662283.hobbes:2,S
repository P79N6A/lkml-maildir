Merging patches together would cause increased complexity.
The best solution would be to move this hunk to the patch which removes
IDETAPE_FLAG_PIPELINE_ACTIVE flag.

We want to keep the driver functional in between the patches, especially
given that it shouldn't be much more difficult to do so.

We always want fully bisectable patches:
- if the patch series accidentaly completely breaks the code we want to be
  able narrow it down to the guilty change
- if the patch series causes some regressions (ie. worse performance) we
  also want to see which exact change caused it
[ Nothing changes here and removal of pipeline functionality can't be an
  excuse for not sticking to the standard procedure. ]

idetape_empty_write_pipeline() which is called for _reads_ calls
idetape_add_chrdev_write_request() - could you tell if there are none
hidden interactions caused by not waiting for the active request to
finish?
[ I don't know and it is really not obvious from looking at ide-tape.c
  (it is quite complicated code) - that is why I want to play it safe. ]
