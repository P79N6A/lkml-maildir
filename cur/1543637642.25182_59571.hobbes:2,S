ok, then it turns out that we agree, Solaris does "the right thing" in this
respect.

right, solaris share everything!
it maps text, data, etc... MAP_PRIVATE (COW) and uses the segmap to unify
access between read, write and mmaped MAP_SHARED pages so that
only a single page exists for any single filesystem page. You can see proof
of this by writing a little C program and then while it's running modify it
(say it prints for instance changes from "this is a test" to "this xx a
xxxx" ) and overwrite the new file with mmap MAP_SHARED type access or with
write(), the programs output will change on the fly while it's running.
When I differentiate between filesystem pages and executable, I should have
been specific in saying that executable pages almost always have a named
file as thier backing store, but for this discussion executable means that
the page has the execute bit set.
For priority paging they actually warn that standard files that are mmapped
will be incorrectly treated like executables if they have the execute bits
set. This probably happens quite often so it's not perfect.
