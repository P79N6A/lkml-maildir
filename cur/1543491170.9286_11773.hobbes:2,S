Ok, this is with the PASSWD env. variable set:
Mar 27 14:16:37 reliant kernel: smb_trans2_request: result=-32, setting invalid
Mar 27 14:16:37 reliant kernel: smb_retry: new pid=16508, generation=3
Mar 27 16:53:27 reliant kernel: smb_trans2_request: result=-32, setting invalid
:: 	The error=-3 is telling me that the smbmount daemon is gone, or didn't
:: get registered right, or blew a core ball, or something.  The smbfs module
:: is trying to signal it to rebuild the connection and it's not there.  When
:: this happens, can you do a "ps ax" and check if there is an smbmount process
:: running?
:: 
:: 	If there is not, then the problem is to determine what happened to it.
:: 
:: 	What you might want to do is to do the mount and then find the process
:: id of the smbmount daemon.  Once you have that, run gdb on the smbmount
:: binary and "attach {PID}" from the gdb prompt and then "continue".  If
:: smbmount exits for some reason, you'll get a gdb prompt back with the exit
:: reason.  If it's some error, you can type "where" and get a traceback.
:: That will tell me a lot, if this thing is exiting prematurely.
Here is the output from gdb:

I'll try it again with the password on the command line and see what
