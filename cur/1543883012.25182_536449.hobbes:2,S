Oh, and also ptrace! I think I was almost fooled by that attempt to flush
the cache in copy_to_user_page.
But that also fails if you map the underlying page with multiple virtual
addresses (or processes, if the icache is not flushed on ctxsw), because
those others won't have their caches flushed, right?
