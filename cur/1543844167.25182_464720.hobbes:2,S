Subject: Buffer I/O error on Sony Ericsson W810i (writing/sync to memory stick duo via phone's USB)

Running 2.6.17 (Debian unstable 2.6.17-2-k7).
When after a copy operation I unmount the phone's smart card, the 
unmount stalls, and gives these errors in syslog
Buffer I/O error on device sdg1, logical block 960472

udi is '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_uuid_4511_4C30').
The card is a 512MB SanDisk Memory Stick PRO Dudo (labelled MagicGate).
After the start of the umount, 'df' starts reporting the device as much 
larger than it is:
/dev/sdg1             4,6G  4,3G  143M  97% /media/PHONE CARD
Before the unmount it reports it correctly.
The unmount operation never stops, and the files are not successfully 
copied.
I also tried to manually run 'sync' manually, and after a long, long 
while -- like 4-5 minutes, it exited, and I could unmount it gracefully.
The copy operation seems to have worked fine in this case.
Anyone using the same device with greater success? How can I easily 
debug this?
Cheers.
