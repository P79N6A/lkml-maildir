Hmm. The basics of the SLAB allocator are rather simple. 
I'd be interested in seeing an alternate approach. There is the danger
that you will end up end up with the same complexity as before.

Quite a long list of unsupported features. These academic papers
usually only focus on one thing. The SLAB allocator has to work
for a variety of situations though.
It would help to explain what ultimately will be better in the new slab 
allocator. The complexity could be taken care of by reorganizing the code.
