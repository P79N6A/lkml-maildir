Surely a better option would be to have rmmod remove modules in
sequence, and not consider any module until it has already considered
all modules that module is used by. That would implicitly result in
the removal of the whole chain of modules rather than just the one at
the top as currently appears to be the case.
Best wishes from Riley.
