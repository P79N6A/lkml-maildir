	The usual implementation is you have a 'permanent' fd_set and a 'temporary'
fd_set. Before each call to select, you memcpy the permanent fd_set into the
temporary and pass the temporary to select. If you wish to stop selecting
for read or write on a given socket, you remove it from the appropriate
permanent set. This way you don't have to twiddle too many bits.
