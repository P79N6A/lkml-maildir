Subject: exiting X kills 2.2.5 and 2.2.9

I posted this to c.o.l.d.s and Patrick LoPresti suggested that I post
to the linux mailing list as well.  He thought this might be related
to a problem you are trying to track down.  I am not subscribed, so if
you want me to supply any more information, please CC me.
Here's the post:
Does anyone else have this problem?  I have a fresh RH 6.0 system.
Almost every time I try to exit X the system hangs.  No warnings in
the syslog file, no nothing, it just stops dead with a blank screen
after the X server goes down.  It doesn't answer pings, so I think it
is more than just the X server crashing.
I discovered that I can get X to shut down cleanly if I first kill
esd.  (I've been trying the default GNOME setup on 6.0).  Does anyone
else have this problem?
I've got an ATI All in Wonder Pro, a celeron 333 and a soundblaster
audio card, if that makes any difference.
Here's some additional info:
The 2.2.5 kernel was the one supplied with RedHat 6.0.  I upgraded to
2.2.9 using clean kernel sources (tar-ball, not rpm) and compiling it
myself.  
Kernel: 2.2.5 and 2.2.9
OS: RedHat Linux 6.0
CPU: Intel Celeron 333 (not overclocked)
MB: Abit BH6 
Desktop: Gnome 1.0.  I am using it right off the CD which appears to
	 be a variety of releases from 1.0.1 to 1.0.8
ESD: 0.2.12 (off CD)
Enlightenment: 0.15.5 (off CD)
Soundcard:  ESS ES1869 Plug and Play AudioDrive  (not soundblaster, I
	    guess.  This is detected by sndconfig and works well.)
Symptom: When I quit X with either CTRL-ALT-Backspace, or loggin out
	 of gnome the system hangs.  The machine is not pingable and
	 does not respond to keyboard input.  This also happens when I
	 switch to a VC from X.
Workaround: Kill the sound daemon, first.  If I kill esd then it doesn't
	    hang.  I have no idea why.
I noticed that on the vmware web site they say there is an X server
bug that a commmbination of enlightenment and vmware in full screen
mode manage to tickle causing a hang.  I wonder if that is related to
this?  
Thanks for all of your work.  Please let me know if there is any way I
can help.
