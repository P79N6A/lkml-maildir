No, they do not. Numlock is not responding. The CD-RW drives were not locked up.
I already experienced drive lockups earlier, the eject button does not respond,
the LED on one of the drives changes to red (instead of green -> normal operation
or orange -> writing)
In the meantime I was busy compiling libcddb-0.9.4, libcdio-0.66
and vcdimager-0.7.20. I am trying to read the CDs back with it,
the changelog mentions memleak fixes.
(several minutes later) Hm, it finished now, the overburned
SVCD is read back, it's about 20MB shorter than the original mpeg.
I got this error:
$ vcdxrip -C /dev/cdrom -p -v
!ASSERT: file mpeg.c: line 509 (_analyze_pes_header): assertion failed: (vcd_bitvec_peek_bits (buf, pos2, 8) == 0x0f)
Terminated
Somehow I expected that. So vcdimager-0.7.14 is faulty, the machine
lockup was in fact an OOM. Sorry for the noise.
