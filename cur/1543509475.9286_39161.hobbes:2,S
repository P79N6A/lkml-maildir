When you F_SETSIG an RT signal, as you probably know it'll fill in si_fd with
the file descriptor. Stephen's patches also fill in si_band to tell you what
kind of operation the signal is for, that way you don't have to poll() or
select() on the FD to see what kind of operation should be performed (at least
that's my understanding).
Hopefully these will be integrated into the stable tree soon since without it,
SIGIO doesn't do much for you.
