And umount?  Anything that umounts or remountes a filesystem
has to modify /etc/mtab to remove or alter the relevant
line.
I traced a umount and it did the write-to-temp+rename 
routine.  I wouldn't expect that to work to well in proc.
And you should have seen the ugly fstat64,_llseek,write
loop it used.
To put this in kernel means changing how it is updated.
Once we do that we might as well go all the way.

#2 with warnings i like better than keeping a deprecated mount
syscall until 2038.
