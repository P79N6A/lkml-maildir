It would actually be better to use two floating IP numbers. That way during
normal operation, both servers would be functioning simultaneously
(based on the shared storage on two nodes).
Then during failover, the floating IP of the failed node is activated on the
remaining node (total of 3 IP numbers now, one real, two floating). The NFS
recovery cycle should then cause the clients to remount the filesystem from
the backup server.
When the failed node is recovered, the active server should then disable the
floating IP associated with the recovered server, causing only the mounts
using that IP number to fall back to the proper node, balancing the load
again.
