In the reality I'm familiar with, the defense contractor's secure
projects building had one entrance, guarded by security guards who were
not cheap $10/hr guys, with strict instructions.  No computers or
computer media were allowed to leave the building except with written
authorization of a corporate officer.  The building was shielded against
Tempest attacks and verified by the NSA.  Any computer hardware or media
brought into the building for the project was physically destroyed at
the end.
Secure nets _are_ possible.
