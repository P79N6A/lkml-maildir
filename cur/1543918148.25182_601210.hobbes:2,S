Very interesting. I had agreed with these patches being pulled but it
was simply on the grounds that there was no agreement it was the right
thing to do. It was best to have mainline and -mm behave the same from a
fragmentation perspective and revisit this idea from scratch. That it
affects swapping loads is news so thanks for that.

My belief is that SLUB can still use the higher orders if configured to
do so at boot-time. The loss of these patches means it won't try and do
it automatically. Christoph will chime in I'm sure.
