Subject: [PATCH] HZ: 300Hz support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Fix two things. Firstly the unit is "Hz" not "HZ". Secondly it is useful
to have 300Hz support when doing multimedia work. 250 is fine for us in
Europe but the US frame rate is 30fps (29.99 blah for pedants). 300
gives us a tick divisible by both 25 and 30, and for interlace work 50
and 60. It's also giving similar performance to 250Hz.
I'd argue we should remove 250 and add 300, but that might be excess
disruption for now.
