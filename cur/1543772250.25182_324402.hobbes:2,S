[PATCH] PCI: MSI functionality broken on Serverworks GC chipset
MSI functionality is broken on the GC_LE x86 chipset that Serverworks
developed and that is being used in various platforms today. Broadcom is
going to push out to the kernel MSI enabled Gigabit drivers (in the very
near future), and we would like to make sure that MSI does not get
enabled on any platforms using the GC_LE chipset (device id 0x17).
Following the AMD 8131 example, I am including a patch to disable MSI
functionality when a GCNB_LE is detected. Please let me know if there
are any issues with this. This is a permanent fix for this chipset, as
the hardware will not be updated.
