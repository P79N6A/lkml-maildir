Unfortunately, this isn't easy to do, while keeping stuff like serial
consoles working from early at bootup.  Alan Cox definitely does not
want to see the serial console initialised any later than it is today,
and he's not the only one.
In addition, the "legacy" devices are part of the 8250.c module - they
have to be for serial console.  The PNP devices are probed as part of
the 8250_pnp.c module, and since 8250_pnp.c depends on 8250.c, the
serial PNP ports will _always_ be initialised after the ISA probes.
