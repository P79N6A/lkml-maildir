There isn't such a thing as a small race. Either there is a race or there
is no race. 'Should usually work' is not enough, especially when security
is concerned.

Yes.
This is a serious problem. Your scheme has very nasty failure modes.
By implementing this in user space you are introducing additional
failure modes.
- You need disk access -> EIO
- You have no control over memory allocation -> ENOMEM, EIO in swap space
Usually I'd not care about EIO, but here security is threatened. EIO crashing
the system under some circumstances is inevitable, EIO opening a security
hole is not acceptable however.

4000 spawnings is 32MB for kernel stacks alone.
You cannot assume that resources will be sufficient for that.
That again is a serious problem, because you cannot resync.
If you lose a 'remove' event you're screwed.
And of course, what do you do if the driver is not yet loaded?
