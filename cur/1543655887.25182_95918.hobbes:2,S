Same here. I also have a MSI KT3 Ultra2 and the same problem with 2.4.20
The -ac1 patch helped because it booted just fine and I had dma on my 
harddisk. But then I had problems mounting my dvd drive ... I'll try 
the new -ac2 patch today, let's see if it makes any difference.
Btw: I think it depends what cd/dvd drive you have. I've heard from 
other people with MSI KT3 Ultra2 who have no problem with 2.4.20 
(without ac1 patch) and dma on disks plus dvd/cd/cdrw.
