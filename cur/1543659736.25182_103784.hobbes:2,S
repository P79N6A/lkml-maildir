Guys, is this normal?

This is on a PC with no swap and no disk, booting off an initrd stored 
on a compact flash.  I can understand that while sleep is running, the 
amount of free memory is reduced.  Why does the number stay reduced even 
after it is done running?  No matter how long you wait, the number never 
comes back up.  Is the memory really gone or is there something I don't 
understand about /proc/meminfo?  Or does this have something to do with 
the ramdisk?  Thanks.
