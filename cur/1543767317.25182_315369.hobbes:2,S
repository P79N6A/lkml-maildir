For user mounts, there should be no practical way of maintaining mtab,
especially if the users are using private namespaces (as suggested in 
another thread) or if they are supposed to be able to unmount using
a non-suid generic umount.

The drawback of /proc/mounts is not showing the -oloop information.
Either it's easy to implement showing that extra information, or you'll
need a ~/.etc/mtab
