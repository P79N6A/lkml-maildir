Well, the math for teh very worst case is something like: 
100,000,000  bits/sec
/8 
= 12500000  bytes/sec
/64  bytes/ping
= 195312.5  ping/sec
/100
= 1953 ping/jiffy
rounded to 2048
/2 = 1024 rx buffers per 1/2 jiffie.  
1024 means you can withstand a wire-speed storm while interrupting twice
per jiffy.
