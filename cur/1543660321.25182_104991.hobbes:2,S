Comments:
Basic idea is good. The x86-64 2.4 tree has a similar solution for the
same problem. Especially with HZ=1000 this is really needed, because
now lost ticks are far more common than with the HZ=100 in 2.4.
I would consider some form of this patch as requirement for 2.6 release.
what happens when 1000000 does not evenly divide HZ? 
I think some ports use HZ=1024
Why is the condition > and not >= ? Eactly two ticks offset is already
one lost. In fact even >= 1.5*HZ would be dubious.
I would like to have some statistics counter somewhere in /proc for lost 
ticks, so that it can be checked for after bug reports. Perhaps even
printk for the first 5 or so.
Could you please add spaces after /* and before */
