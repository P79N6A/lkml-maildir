Yes, I agree that heuristics can be used to determine the coding
system used with a high degree of probability.  I'm just suggesting we
make the coding system explicit, in order to spare other applications
that do visual presentation of Linux source code having to perform
their own heuristics.
But hey, if I'm the only one wanting to see this particular bike shed
