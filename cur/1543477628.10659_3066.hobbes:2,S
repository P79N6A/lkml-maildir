Hi Alan,

I have a minor bug for you to add to your list.  Kernels after 2.1.70
need a newer version of smbmount.  Unfortunatly this is not mentioned in
Documentation/Changes or Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt.  I have no
idea where to get the newer version (thats why I know its not in those files),
or I would send you a patch.
Thanks,
Jim
