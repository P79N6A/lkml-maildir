First, let me say that this message is VASTLY offtopic for the linux-kernel
mailing list.  This mailing list is for discussion of the Linux kernel's
internals - NOT about basic C programming.

My C compiler won't compile that - it claims you're assigning to an invalid
lvalue.  I suspect there's a compiler bug to do with assignments in a
ternary operator as the rvalue of an assignment.  Wrapping the two x='s on
the right-hand side generates the expected output.
