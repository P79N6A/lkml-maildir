I've tried it a few times on 2.6.0-test3 right after the system comes up and I 
log in to text mode, and the sucker spits out exactly one line of text 
(something like "Suspending processes:") and hangs with the cursor right 
after the semicolon.  After about a minute I hit ctrl-scroll lock, but 
everything except the suspend thread (which was waiting in some kind of yield 
for other threads to do something) scrolled off the top and I don't know how 
to cursor up to see it (or get it to not scroll off).
I'd be happy to test someting better.  APM suspend doesn't work on my new 
thinkpad, so it's swsusp or nothing.  Currently, it's "shutdown -h now", 
which has some obvious deficiencies...
