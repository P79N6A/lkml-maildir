Hi,
I tried with the /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory=2 and the system refused to
load the program altogether.
In this scenario is making overcommit_memory=2 a good idea?
Regards,
Abu.

Bad idea - in the configuration you have, the system may need the
out-of-memory killer to free up memory, otherwise the system can
deadlock due to all memory being exhausted.

Please see Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting in the kernel source tree.
