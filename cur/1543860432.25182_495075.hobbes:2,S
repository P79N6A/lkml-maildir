Previously there was only one GCC version (4.1.1 totally replaced 3.4.3, and 
is the system wide GCC), now I have installed 3.4.6 into /opt/gcc-3.4.6 and 
it is only PATH'ed explicitly by me when I wish to compile a kernel using it:
export PATH=/opt/gcc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH
cp /boot/config-2.6.19-test .config
make oldconfig
make

The tree is a pristine 2.6.19.

Crippling the machine, though. Impractical for something that isn't 
immediately reproducible.
