It appears to simply speed up the delay case.
One thing that I noticed though--the patch had the following line:
if ((n == 0) && (inp == NULL) && (outp == NULL) && (exp == NULL)) {
Would it be enought to just do the following?
if (n == 0) {
Given that if any of the fd_set pointers are non-empty, "n" ought to be 
non-zero, would this be a sufficient check?
