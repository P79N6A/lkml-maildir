I have looked into this a bit more. It seems you also need to be writing
to disk to cause processes to be blocked (otherwise they are just very
slow), for example redirecting the output of the above commands to a
file. I also did an strace of processes that I knew would be blocked and
and found two system calls that never return: stat() and mkdir()
Is this normal if the problem was the elevator code?
