Just a data point -
Running 2.4.14-pre6 + preempt + a.m.  low latency
Hardware = PIII-933 on intel mobo, 512 MB
Video = voodoo3 agp
I gave DRI a workout with several hours of
wolfenstein network demo, then ran 40 min or
so of dbench and then let normal services run
through the night. The system remains smooth
and responsive, no incidents in syslog.
So there may be specific driver bugs which
are being invoked in your situation.
