Right now, we don't have a proper userland notification. So far, the
main affected thing is XFree, but this is ok as it will have received
a suspend request via /dev/apm_bios (which we emulate on PowerMacs),
and so won't touch the framebuffer until resumed.
There isn't much we can do against a userland client tapping the
framebuffer that it mmap'ed previously. I don't know how feasible it
would be to sort of "hack" this process mapping on the fly (would
involve some nasty SMP synchronisation issues) so that the userland
process is just put to sleep on fb access while the fb is suspended
(or get a SEGV). We probably want to extend the notification mecanism
to userland in some way, but this isn't something i cover in this
patch.
Ben.
