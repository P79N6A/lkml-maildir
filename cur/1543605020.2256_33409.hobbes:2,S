This has  been the trend throughout the 2.4 series. 2.4.0 was quite
snappish at resyncs and speed has generally dropped from version to
version. I recall seeing a speed halving somewhere early in the series
(2.4.2?).

Not that I have seen. Raid resyncs are throttled via a braking mechanism
in the generic md code (I think it's called fooresyncbar). It attempts
to guage the current resync speed and compares with the min and max values
and either calls for more resyncs or schedules. But even removing this
brake from the code doesnt't spped things up, so I am mystified as to
where the throttling effect comes from. It must be somewhere else in
the structire of the code.
Another problem is that there seem sto be some kind of state .. if the
raid resync starts while the machine is under load, then it runs slowly
and continues at that rate even when the other load is removed.
