The reason I mentioned it is because I've got a keyboard which
physically has a Japanese layout, but emulates a US keyboard in set 2.
Some keys which are shifted on a US keyboard, are not shifted on a
Japanese keyboard, for example, the colon key.  Presing colon on my
keyboard in set 2, causes it to send shift-; on the wire.  In set 3,
it sends the single code for the colon key.
I wondered whether some users in this thread had keyboards like mine,
which seem to produce unusual results when you analyse the scancodes
coming from them.  It looks like mine is rarer than I thought :-).

Agreed.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to use some of the keys in set
2 on mine :-).
