I basically agree.  Most people use precompiled kernel packages though.
For them we add kernel log messages, for example.  We also preemptively
get in touch with user mailinglists and the like, but we reach only a
fraction of affected people there either.
For people who actually compile kernels, especially distributors, it
would indeed be helpful if "make oldconfig" and Co. show a prompt if an
option entered feature removal schedule.  Actually this has been done
before for things like particular sysfs changes, with ad-hoc CONFIG_
variables.
