I post a patch for comment on ext2-devel for the
NFS cookie bug.  Did not get any feedback yet.
As Ted suggested, it set the cookie to -1 on EOF,
even though it is not seek able to there.
I only test it with Stephen's "readdir.c".
Not have chance to run it on a NFS server yet.
Do you have more information about the cache trashing
bug?
Regards,
Chris
