"difficult" is a relative word, nothing is difficult but everything is
difficult, depends the way you feel about it.
but note that even with rmap you don't know the pmd that points to the
pte that you want to relocate and for the anon pages you miss
information about mm and virtual address where those pages are
allocated, so basically rmap is useless for doing it, you need to do the
pagetable walking ala swap_out, in turn it's not easier at all in 2.5
than it could been in 2.4 (but of course this is a 2.5 thing only, I
just want to say that if it's not difficult in 2.5 it wasn't difficult
in 2.4 either).
