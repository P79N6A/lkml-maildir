Hello again,
When i originally posted this, it was _highly_ OT. the machine in question
runs windows ME, but i figured the best place to find hardware gurus was
here.
the topic has rather degraded, and while i enjoy getting mail from alan,
the fact that it has nothing to do with me dampens the enthusiasm =)
if you're going to go changing the subject, at least mention framebuffers,
as that seems to be the common thread.
if you all could de-cc me on these, it'd be appreciated.
