Hi
I just wanted to compile 2.4.0-test3 on my alpha (alcor ) 366 MHz 21164
and on linking the linker creates an error message:
undefined reference to lost_ticks in do_gettimeofday and
do_settimeofday. Where is last_ticks gone. As I´m not (yet) too much
into kernel programming I only submit this report ...
