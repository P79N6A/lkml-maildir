Ack. I already replied to myself that the BIOS update cureed it.

the disable_timer_pin_1  option helps too. But with APIC my box does not reume 
and hangs after the suspend / resume cycle. With noapic I can suspend / 
resume weeks without a hazzle. With acpi_sleep=s3_bios even the text console 
comes back nicely. Though I mostly use X anyway. Only shutdown / reboot does 
not work after resume. I think the BIOS hangs after the associated ACPI call.

Since I'm alergic to binary only stuff I did not gave fglrx much tries - did 
not work well anyway. I use X11R7 since the first release candidates 
accelerated 2D works fine with the radeon driver. No issues even with week 
long suspend resume cycles, that is it replaced my former Apple iBook G3 
completely.
Distribution is T2 (
http://www.t2-project.org
) with mostly trunk:HEAD running 
(that is modular anything).
Yours,
