Ok then do it for all pages that go back not just for those leftover from 
the moving of pages to the inactive list (why would you move those???)

Just trying to figure out what your patch does there and it does not make 
much sense to me so far.
Maybe the hunk does apply in a different location than I thought. If you 
do that in the loop over the pages on active list then it would make 
sense. But in that case you need another piece of it doing the same to the 
pages that are released at the end of shrink_active_list().
