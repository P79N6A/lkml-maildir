Hmmm - problem compiling nfsd (v3) as a module. Compiles fine, but at
modprobe time, complains about missing symbol. If I remember
correctly, it was nfsd_linkage. Sorry, can't post the .config and a
more details report til tomorrow.
I noticed this problem quite a while ago - can't remember when it
started.
