I see. But I wonder if there ever was a real need for these hooks (in
2.4 times?): If I look at bamboo_early_serial_map() e.g., I find it
calling into early_serial_setup() which fills serial8250_ports[] - and
that content is now retrieved via serial8250_get_port_def() when we
parse the runtime or build-time provided parameters (port number &
baudrate).

I think a lot of cruft piled up in the kgdb patches over their long life. :)
Thanks for your feedback!
