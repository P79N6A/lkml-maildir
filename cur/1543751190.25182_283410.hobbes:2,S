Capabilities don't work, because of missing filesystem
capabilities. If you have them, it's a question of setting the
appropriate permitted, inheritable and effective capability sets.
I didn't follow the whole thread. But if you want to grant
capabilities on a per user/group basis, may I suggest accessfs user
based capabilities, for example? :-)
Regards, Olaf.
