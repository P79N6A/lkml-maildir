If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do it too?
I submit to you that the reason The Other OS needs the concept of a object
model from the kernel through to user space is because the architects had a
very fuzzy concept of "boundary".  Yes, you need stuff like that if your GUI
and your IIS (yes, really, Win2003 apparently has IIS on the kernel side of the
boundary now).  If you have a syscall interface, the kernel is free to
implement read() in any way it wants, and the userspace calling read() is able
to use it for pretty much anything.
Ask yourself:  (a) Could I implement .NET in userspace using the supplied syscalls?
(b) If .NET was implemented and enforced kernel-side, could I implement CORBA?
Remember - it's quite possible that the user wants some OTHER GUI, or some
OTHER thread model, or some OTHER.....  We're not the operating system run by
jackboots.
