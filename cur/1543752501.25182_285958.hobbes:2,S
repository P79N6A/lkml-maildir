So, a "classification" of the severity of the bug would cause different
type of disclosures?  That's a good idea in theory, but trying to nail
down specific for bug classifications tends to be difficult.
Although I think both Red Hat and SuSE have a classification system in
place already that might help out here.
Anyway, if so, I like it.  I think that would be a good thing to have,
if for no other reason that I don't want to see security announcements
for every single driver bug that's patched that had caused a user
created oops.
thanks,
