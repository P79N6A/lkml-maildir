Just fui.  There's another 'bounder pointers' project, located here:
http://gcc.gnu.org/proj-bp.html#status
under "Goals":
    Low Overhead
    Space and time overheads for bounded-pointer programs are
    both approx 150%..200% (i.e., 2.5x..3x slowdown and
    2.5x..3x code size increase). A couple years back I
    implemented bounded pointers in gcc-2.7.2 with much hackage
    at the RTL layer, and using a special BP machine mode (akin
    to the complex-number machine modes) that allowed gcc to
    assign BP components individually to registers, and to
    pass/return BPs components in registers. This version had
    space and time overhead of only 75%, and that was without
    any optimizations to eliminate redundant checks.
    This experience leads me to believe that with optimizations
    to eliminate redundant bounds checks, and with the ability
    to assign BP components individually to registers, space
    and time overhead can be brought under 50% (i.e., 1.5x
    slowdown and 1.5x code size increase).
