After reading Ed's drafts, I could not help but interject here.  I'm not
necessarily sure that more is better.  I think something a bit more
brief, with a shorter "background" section but sufficient pointers to
additional information would be much more appropriate.  (Per the
suggestions of the various dumbasses on /., I have also repaired some of
the grammar and spelling.  Although I love that site dearly, someone
should teach most of them some interpersonal etiquette.)
Some notes about the following:
(1) "more than 15 million users" has a quotable reference from
Infoworld.  If anyone has a reference for "nearly 20 million users," let
me know.
(2) Denigrating any other software (including Microsoft's) is
inappropriate and unprofessional.  I included the first Vinod (did
someone check the spelling of his name) comment, because it is
interesting, ironic, and doesn't necessarily say bad things about
Windows.
(3) Much more important than bringing down other software is touting
good "generalities" about Linux.  I don't think we should distribute a
twenty page release with every possible good feature of Linux listed.
 Rather, we should build on the reputation Linux already has: reliable,
stable, and mature.
(4) Don't make the reader sound stupid.  I changed "Advanced technical
users" to "Many pioneering users" to remove the implication that the
reader is not an "advanced technical user."
(5) I tried to clear up the distinction between Linux and the
GNU software as much as possible.  Personally, I refer to the entire
operating system as "Linux," not as "GNU/Linux," and I suspect about
99.9999% of Linux users do the same.  Therefore, I say that "`Linux' is
the common name for a series of operating system distributions based
primarily on the Linux kernel and software from the Free Software
Foundation's GNU Project."  This is factually correct, while at the same
time properly crediting the work of the Free Software Foundation.
(6) I have left open the "features" part of the actual release
statement; I don't really know what's significant enough to include
there, although it would be smart to include the new features that
businesses would find useful.  "Y2K readiness" or some such crap should
be left out, IMO.
Feel free to send me comments of any variety.  Please be aware that all
flames will be directed to /dev/null.

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released

SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- The Linux kernel development team has officially
announced the release of a new version of the Linux kernel.  This
update brings advanced scalability and broad support for newer
hardware, while maintaining the stability and reliability that have
been traditional hallmarks of the Linux kernel.
Among the new features of the 2.2.0 kernel are **BLAH** [Something
needs to be added here that doesn't sound like Microsoft doublespeak.]
Many pioneering users have already installed this update, available
from the Linux Kernel Archive (
http://www.kernel.org/
).  Linux system
vendors will begin shipping systems using the new kernel in March.
Business users will be able to obtain the update from their Linux
distribution vendor.  As always, the Linux kernel is distributed as
Free Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
available for perusal at the web site of the Free Software Foundation
(
http://www.fsf.org/
).
BACKGROUND -- "Linux" is the common name for a series of operating
system distributions based primarily on the Linux kernel and software
from the Free Software Foundation's GNU Project.  Linux is available
for most popular computer architectures, including but not limited to
x86, Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS, and Sparc.
Since the Linux kernel was created in 1991 by then Finnish university
student Linus Torvalds, Linux has grown to an installed base estimated
at more than 15 million users worldwide.  With its 212% growth rate in
1998, it is the fastest growing server operating system.  Among its
advantages attracting new users are:
 * An open development model, which enables any user to modify the
   operating system components and submit patches to the official
   distribution.  This both facilitates the development of new
   features and enables users to repair problems within hours after
   they have been located.  [This is very awkward.  It needs work in
   delineating the concept I have brought out here.]
 * Usability.  Linux has both advanced graphical user interfaces in
   GNOME and KDE and a flexible command line, enabling power users
   and novices alike to work in a comfortable environment. [I'm not
   quite sure this is what I'm trying to say.]
 * Stability and reliability.  Linux machines have been known to run
   for years without rebooting, and in most cases, only kernel
   replacements -- not application installations -- necessitate such
   action.
 * Maturity.  Linux is modelled after UNIX, an operating system with
   proven stability through nearly thirty years of research and
   development.
Microsoft engineers Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a
competitive examination of Linux (Halloween Document,
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), write that "Linux
represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission critical
applications, and - due to its open source code - has a long term
credibility which excedes many other competitive operating systems."
