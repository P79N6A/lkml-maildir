I did not see anything being killed from the run under single user mode.
However, the sysrq does scroll past, so I only see the final 60 lines.
Is there a fool-proof way to check?

The File starts empty (the program creates it).  The box hangs when the file is 5.9GB
(6308233217), or at least this is the file size when the box comes back.

I only see problems when running on nfs.
Other details:
nfs options:
rw,v3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,intr,lock,proto=tcp,addr=x.x.x.x
This is going over a dedicated Gb x-over cable to a clustered NetApp.
