Sure! My proposal is to remove a few more - so we could
transmit this data from mostly not buggy SCSI drivers
really fast!

IMHO admins care far more about infallibility than speed. Every
such "saving" causes the bugs are harder to follow, it takes more 
time and people to find bug's paths and more bugs goes to stable.
I'm sure this admin with SCSI - st problem will next time think
3 times before upgrading to the next "stable" - and it'll be only
because of this one buggy driver. (Of course then we don't get his
next bug report, either - so the next SCSI bug will be diagnosed at
least one kernel version later.)
I think Pekka was right (it looks he changed his mind now) something
should be done here. I think something like this should be a minimum:
BUG_ON(!objp || virt_to_cache(objp) != cachep);
to show distinctly what's going on. (BTW, kfree isn't exceptional 
with NULL treatment - neighbouring slob.c works alike.)
