Subject: mismatching skbuff addresses in 3c59x

I'm using a 3c900 and got the following warnings:
Jan 27 14:14:25 panic kernel: eth0: Warning -- the skbuff addresses do
not match in boomerang_rx: c2508031 vs. c2508012.
Jan 27 14:14:27 panic kernel: eth0: Warning -- the skbuff addresses do
not match in boomerang_rx: c790383c vs. c7903812.
I switched to 2.2.14 nine days ago and don't ever remember seeing this
before. It has only happened once on 2.2.14 after which I seemed to lose
networking. 'panic' is the name of my computer.  It didn't panic.
