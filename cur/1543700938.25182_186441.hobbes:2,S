Well, I can't say I can see why. In snd_pcm_oss_write1 where the change
for whole-frag was, I cannot see a race or such.  The only possible
causes I can see, is that:
1) xmms's scheduling gets screwed due to the short writes
2) some drivers may have issues with getting short writes all the time.
Only problem with 2), is that Zinf works fine for you, so I guess the
only thing to assume is that either Zinf do not use OSS, but ALSA
interface, or that 1) is indeed the correct answer.  What version of
XMMS do you use btw?
