Right.  Which is why I called it speculative rather than asynchronous.  It is 
asynchronous I/O under a synchronous interface.

Check my more expanded writeup (
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/ossf/ossf.html
).  The short answer is that a shadow process would be created to hang on to 
the process state at the time of the request.  If the request ends up failing, 
then this shadow process is activated, the original one is killed, and the 
shadow continues from the return with the correct return value.  This 
complicates things because the original must be prevented from letting any 
indication of its success outside its address space until the request has 
actually succeeded.  There would definitely be costs and I don't know whether 
it would turn out to be worth (and I'm actually somewhat doubtful) but it 
might be worth looking at, and other people might have some clever ideas on 
minimizing those costs.

What I had in mind are things like compilers which go chugging sequentially 
through a file and do expensive stuff on it (like parsing).  It ought to be 
pretty easy for the I/O to stay ahead of the parse, and maybe a useful amount 
of parsing can be done before the data all comes in.

Me neither.

Ditto here too.
