I think it depends on how you use tmpfs. When you use it for read/write
it's a good idea because you likely don't care about a bit of additional
latency and it's better to not fill up your local nodes with temporary
files.
If you use it with mmap then you likely want local policy.
But that's a big ugly to distingush, that is why I suggested the sysctl.
