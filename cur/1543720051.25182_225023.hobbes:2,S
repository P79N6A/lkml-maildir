The essential gain, in my view, of cpumask, is that it encapsulates
the value NR_CPUS.  cpumasks are bitmaps of length NR_CPUS.
Yes, there is an open issue of whether cpumasks are worth it.
I think enough code has taken to them that they are.
The getting at internals (via cpus_addr(), I'm guessing you mean)
was a workaround for some code that messed with cpumasks and simple
unsigned longs as if they were interoperable.  "cpus_addr" should
be marked deprecated, and its use coded out.  Its remaining uses
are in arch-specific areas where I lack the expertise and testing
environment to accomplish such.
I needed some legacy mechanism such as this, in order to avoid
having such existing uses bring the entire cpumask overhaul to
a screeching halt.
