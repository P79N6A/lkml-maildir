 More info on this: I just switched from the k6-233 to a k6-2/300, and
tested with the same results, so it may well be kernel. Here is the
bt of the 61mb core file. It looks like maybe a trashed stack.
Core was generated by `/usr/bin/ld -m elf_i386 -shared -o libraptorhtml.so /usr/lib/crti.o /usr/lib/gc'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
