Subject: 2.5.64-mm8 breaks MASQ

I have been attempting to test the -mm kernels.  I was having problems
with the anticipatory scheduler up causing the machine to hang during
loading of the USB driver.  The recent fixes that went into -mm8 seem to
have corrected this problem, unfortunately I'm now hitting another
issue.
It seems that -mm8 breaks MASQ support in iptables.  Actually I can't
get any MASQ/NAT to work at all.  The same exact config works fine with
vanilla 2.5.64 and 2.5.64-ac4.
Backing out the brlock patches returns everything to normal operation so
there's something happening with those.  I'll try to look at them
individually if I get a chance but I know practically nothing about that
code so somebody will probably spot a problem quicker.
Later,
Tom
