Hmm, this is a possibility but I think it would get complicated quickly.
Just so you know, I'm running into this problem with USB and the new
URBs interface.
I could export a __submit_urb interface which assumes the lock is held,
but it would most likely be UHCI specific and needlessly complicate the
interface.
This would also need to be done for __unlink_urb as well. I'd rather go
with the add/delete queue instead. (option #2)
