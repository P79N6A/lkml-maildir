Roman, it is really not about 'experience', and yes, we all make 
frequent mistakes.
it's about the plain fact that i happened to write _both_ the old and 
the new code you were talking about all along. In this discussion about 
nice levels you were (very) agressively asserting things that were 
untrue, you were suggesting that i dont understand the code, instead of 
simply asking me why the code was written in such a way and what the 
motivation behind it was. I'd be glad to attempt to answer such a 
friendly question, if you are interested in asking it and if you are 
interested in my answer. Thanks,
	Ingo
