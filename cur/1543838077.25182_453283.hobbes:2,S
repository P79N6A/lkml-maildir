radix-trees are nice because you can efficiently traverse them in-order
while the contents are changing (albeit potentially missing newly-added
things, but that's inevitable).
radix-trees are not-nice because they allocate memory at insertion time. 
If that's a problem then rbtrees could perhaps be used.
idr-trees have similar characteristics to the radix-trees, except a) the
idr-tree find-next-above feature could perhaps be used for the core pid
allocation and b) idr-trees don't presently have suitable search functions
for performing the iteration.
At least we have plenty of choices ;)
