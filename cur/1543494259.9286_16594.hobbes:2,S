2.2.6_andrea2 was faster than 2.2.7_andrea2. So before start stabilizing
the code I am reasearching the reasons for this performances-loss. I think
this patch could be the one that will give us again 2.2.6_andrea2
performances. The patch is against 2.2.7_andrea2:

I am not completly sure though. I removed the code above after
2.2.6_andrea2 in order to have a saner VM but it wasn't a bug at all. So
now I reinserted it and I am waiting a feedback from Harvey who is doing a
great work (as you all) in testing my code.
The good thing is that 2.2.7_andrea2 is rock solid while previous kernels
had bugs (swapoff -a was going to corrupt memory... excuse me but I missed
a bit of code in unuse_pte, if just fixed it in 2.2.7_andrea2 though).
If there will be interest in merging my code in 2.2.x I'll be _glad_ ;) to
provide patches for only the relevant/major VM changes for inclusion.
