We've covered this.  Handing pte-dirty pages over to pdflush for prompt
writeback is a perfectly valid, sensible and fast thing to do.
It efficiently solves the single biggest problem with using MAP_SHARED
instead of write().

msync() will write all of the file's dirty pages and it has always has done
