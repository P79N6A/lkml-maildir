Well Rik and I missed it.  Not that this requires much subtlety ;)

Problem is that the rmap VM doesn't perform swapout via pagetables.
It performs it via the LRU.
If someone is sleeping on a pagefault against a mmapped file, and a
truncate happens meanwhile, that page comes back as an anonymous
page.  It's not on the LRU any more so it has become unswappable.
Maybe we can check i_size in filemap_nopage and deliver a SIGBUS
or something.
For now we can go back to the explicit lru_cache_del() in truncate;
the little bit of unswappable memory is preferable to a deadlock
in TCP.  I'll send the patch after a bit of testing.
But (squeaky wheel), longer-term I want to make pagemap_lru_lock
irq safe.  This reduces contention on that lock by 30% (bringing
the total reduction for that patch series to around 98% - wiped off
the map).  And it fixes this problem.  And it allows us to move
pages between LRU lists at IO completion, if we want to do that.
