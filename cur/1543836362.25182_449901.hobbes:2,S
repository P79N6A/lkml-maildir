I think that the issue Zach tried to cover is the current inability to
keep the same binary module across multiple kernel versions. That's why
he compared modules<->kernel to ELF<->glibc. In that sense, he's right.
I'm very happy when I find that old binaries I built with gcc-2.7.2 in
1997 still run under my glibc-2.3.6 without any need to rebuild (and
potentially rebuild gcc-2.7.2 first).
