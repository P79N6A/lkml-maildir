Subject: [PATCH] read EXTRAVERSION from file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The're an very interesting patch in the Debian tree still from the time
where Herbert Xu mentioned it, it allows creating a file .extraversion
in the toplevel kernel directory and the Makefile will set EXTRAVERSION
to it's contents.  This has the nice advantage of keeping an
extraversion pre-tree instead of having to patch the Makefile and
getting rejects everytime you pull a new tree (or BK refuses to touch
the Makefile).
The only thing I'm not fully comfortable is the .extraversion name, I
think I'd prefer a user-visible name.
Any other comments on this one?
