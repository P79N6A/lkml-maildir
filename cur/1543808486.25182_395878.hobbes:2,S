Well in that case in your argument your FADV_WRITE_START is of
the "waits for writeout then starts writeout if dirty" type.
In which case you've just made 3 consecutive  write+wait cycles
to the same page, so it is hardly an optimal IO pattern.

You were saying that your above sequence would be more efficient
if implemented with "always start IO, and just wait for IO", because
"write and wait" would do 2 write+wait cycles.
However "always start IO, and just wait for IO" does 3 write+wait cycles.
