If you have CVS installed, you have RCS merge.

Indeed, you can still have conflicts, which you have to resolve manually.
But it depends on what you want to achieve: do you want to set each config
option in the destination config to max(config1.option, config2.option), or do
you want to apply the recent changes for one config (which may include
disabling options) to another config?
For the latter, merge should work fine.
