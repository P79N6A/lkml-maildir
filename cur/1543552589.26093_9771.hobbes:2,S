It might also/alternatively be generally useful to allow a
filesystem-specific implementation of quotactl itself - through
an additional member in the dquot_operations set of functions?
This would allow ext3 to do that which it needs to do differently
at Q_QUOTAON and would also allow Jan's changes to work in such
a way that both the current form of dquot structure and his new
version of dquots could be used together (his patches currently
change the ondisk dquot definition, which means the existing user
tools get back different structures to what they were expecting,
after issuing certain quotactl commands).
XFS also has its own, different ondisk format for dquots, which
it would like to pass over the quotactl interface - I imagine
filesystems coming from other OSs would too.  The quotactl
syscall is sufficiently generic - its alot like ioctl ;-) -
to allow any size/form of dquot to be passed back to userspace,
so a few new quotactl commands for Jan's new dquot structure
would allow the existing tools to continue to work & new user
tools could take advantage of his extensions (same again for XFS).
Anyway, hope this is useful input.
cheers.
ps: hmm - just realized something... is jank@redhat == jack@suse?
