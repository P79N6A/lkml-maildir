Basically if the setting of 
 * "hdx=flash"          : allows for more than one ata_flash disk to be
 *                              registered. In most cases, only one device
 *                              will be present.
fails then I will look into this but, the breaking of laptops that have
CFA devices that do not come on channels in a pair canb not happen.
If you have a vender unique setting that will follow always the way
I-Opener's are setup then that is better.
Cheers,
