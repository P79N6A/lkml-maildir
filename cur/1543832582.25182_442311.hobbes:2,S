Dependencies happen too, and that was the case with the memhotplug
patches.  Memhotplug, PCI-hotplug, docking -- these things all
have dependencies between multiple sub-systems, and we don't
really have a good process for making things flow smoothly.
Andrew has set himself up to be the clearing house, and he is
so successful that I think that sometimes we tend to
over-use him for that purpose.

Yes, you are right, I was cc'd.  My inbox knew about this issue
and I hadn't noticed it.  It was my mistake to assume a few days later
that the latest driver needed a patch.
So I ask you.  If I fix the Kconfig issue today, will you accept
a push that restores this driver to 2.6.18?
thanks,
