After a very brief look on the relevant part of the patch:
-> Needs to be adapted to CodingStyle all over.
-> The use of AMD specific BUILDNUM etc are not used in-kernel
-> The HAL in lib/cimarron needs to be justified - who are the oter users?
-> There seems to be a _lot_ of specific defines in lib/cimarron - I wonder
   if this is the way used in the rest of the kernel?
But anyway - the patch it not trivially ready for inclusion.
