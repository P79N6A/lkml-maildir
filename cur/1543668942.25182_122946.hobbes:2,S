I keep thinking that it would be nice to have a mechanism for user space
char devices; it would have to have a mechanism to pass all the ioctls
to the process that dealt with it.
(The particular cases which sparked this idea for me were to do user
space SCSI tape drivers to do raid tape and the like, and for emulation
of touch screens or mice on systems that only had the other.).
