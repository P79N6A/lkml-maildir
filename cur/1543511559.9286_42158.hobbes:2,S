Hi
Could someone confirm the process of increasing the maximum number of
processes on a linux system ( Redhat-6.0 / Kernel 2.2.5-22 )
I have a machine which gives out a large number of shares via samba to as
many as 500 workstations and was hitting the maximum number of processes
allowed for root (by default 256) 
I beleive the solution to be the following but would like to know if there
is anything else I need to do. 
Increase the size of the process table from the default 512 processes to
something larger (in include/linux/tasks.h)
change root's ulimit setting in /etc/profile   to allow more than 256
processes.
and use an initscript    for processes started by init to allow them to
also have more than 6 processes. 
This seems to have worked but I would like to know if I have missed
something.
Lee
