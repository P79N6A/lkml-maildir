Tested this on my own system with similar hardware (as far as i2c is
concerned) under 2.6.1-rc2. I did not experience any slowdown.
Could you please provide the following information:
* Output of "lspci -n".
* Can you reproduce the problem with a 2.4.24 kernel and i2c+lm_sensors
  2.8.2?
* Can you reproduce the problem with a 2.6.1-rc2 kernel?
* Can you reproduce the problem without ACPI support enabled into your
  kernel?
* Does the slowdown affect only the hard-disk drive?
* Does the speed come back to normal if you remove i2c-viapro?
* Does the slowdown occur if you load i2c-viapro before w83781d?
Yeah, I know, this is much work, but we need a hint to start digging.
Thanks.
