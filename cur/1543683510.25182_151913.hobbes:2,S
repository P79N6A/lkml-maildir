hi all,
 i have noticed that the processor speed reported by the kernel is different. Here is a list that i have compiled on my notebook:
dmesg.2.4.19:      Detected 999.906 MHz processor.
dmesg.2.4.21:      Detected 1019.778 MHz processor.
dmesg.2.6.0:       Detected 999.927 MHz processor.
dmesg.2.6.0-a3:    Detected 999.903 MHz processor.
ACPI:
dmesg.2.4.21:..... CPU clock speed is 999.9308 MHz.
dmesg.2.6.0:..... CPU clock speed is 1329.0655 MHz.
dmesg.2.6.0-a3:..... CPU clock speed is 1329.0620 MHz.
ACPI:
dmesg.2.4.21:..... host bus clock speed is 133.3240 MHz.
dmesg.2.6.0:..... host bus clock speed is 177.0287 MHz.
dmesg.2.6.0-a3:..... host bus clock speed is 177.0282 MHz.
notebook:
acer tm 620
with
CPU: Intel(R) Pentium(R) III Mobile CPU      1000MHz stepping 01
btw: thx to the ACPI team without the ACPI patch (for 2.4.x)
its not possible to use the nb propperly.
