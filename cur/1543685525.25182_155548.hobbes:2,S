I think the vector allocator code can all be arch specific generic, 
there is no particular reason as to why it has to be MSI specific.

I wish you wouldn't mix up vector and irq like this :( This is really 
beginning to look like IPF. When is an irq an irq and when is a vector a 
vector? This can get very confusing very quickly. I spent a fair 
amount of time debugging this last time due to the confusion in the 
common_interrupt -> do_IRQ path, i'd hate for this to be a permanent 
fixture. If you're going to change things just change everything 
(including variable names) instead of making it conditional.

Is there any locking for msi_desc? Or are you relying on something else?

No need to initialise to 0 it'll be done for you when .bss gets zeroed.

Please just fail and return -ENOSPC or something like that.
Besides my whining thanks for cranking this out.
