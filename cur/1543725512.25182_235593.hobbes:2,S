Part of the reason for dropping cryptoloop is to help dm-crypt mature more 
quickly.
I've had some off-list email on the security of dm-crypt, and it seems
that it does need some work.  We need to get the security right more than 
we need to worry about these other issues.
Let's drop the technically inferior of the two (cryptoloop) and
concentrate on fixing the other (dm-crypt).
There was a thread on redesigning the security a while back (subject:
"dm-crypt, new IV and standards"), but no code came out of it.  Anyone 
interested should probably have a look at that.
