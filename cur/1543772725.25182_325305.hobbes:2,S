Hmm, udev uses it. But, who needs device nodes. :)

I still think we should rename the parent-input device class and keep
the more interesting class named "input", cause this will not break current
setups besides one hotplug-handler and follows the usual style in sysfs.

We don't support childs of class devices until now. Would be nice maybe, but
someone needs to add that to the driver-core first and we would need to make
a bunch of userspace stuff aware of it ...
