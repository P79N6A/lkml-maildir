I suspect that your kernel is compiled with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  Run
$ grep printk /proc/ksyms
and you'll probably see some gobbledegook after it.

You've basically done the right thing.  Your kernel is a little funny,
though.
If you can, rebuild the kernel without module versioning and try again.
Alternatively, adding -DMODVERSIONS after -DMODULE might do the trick.
