Hi!
3ware cards are hardware raidcontrollers, they are supported.
I can get a dawicontrol card here in austria with a silicon image 680
chip on it. I use 3 cards with sil680 chip (because these are not as
expensive as the 3ware cards) with linux-2.4.23 and connected 6 disks as
master holding a raid5 array. Have'nt had any problems till yet (I have
this setup for ~2 month's now).
