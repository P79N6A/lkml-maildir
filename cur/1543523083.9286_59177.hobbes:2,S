My old SCSI-II draft (1993...) says both READ(6) and READ(10) are
mandatory for direct access media (i.e. hard disks).  For CD-ROM drives
READ(6) is optional and READ(10) is mandatory.  Removing all READ(6) code
from sr.c should'nt break anything.
So the only device where you have to use READ(6) are probably pre-scsi2
harddisks (which havn't enouth space for a current unpacked kernel source
tree...)
