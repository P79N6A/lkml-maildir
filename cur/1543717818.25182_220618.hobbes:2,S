Hi,
I have a problem with getting my tv-tuner card to work ... I loaded the 
modules with the right parameters for my card. When I start a tv 
application (be it zapping, xawtv or tvtime) I get video and sound just 
fine. However after a certain time (maybe 10 minutes) video starts 
crashing periodically: first luminance seems to vbe turned up step by 
step and after about 2 minutes video is hardly visible. Then sound 
collapses, video gets heavy distortions and a few seconds later video 
and sound switch back to normal. To illustrate the problem here ( 
http://sarek.webhop.org/tv
 ) are some screenshots - taken each 5 seconds 
approx.
I dont think that this a hardware problem, as the tv-tuner card works 
just fine - even for serveral hours nonstop tv - under windows.
I had this card working several months ago (using kernel 2.4.x or even 
earlier) but now using 2.6.x I can't get it working again
The card is a Typhoon TVCapturer (CPH031, Bt848a, Tuner Temic 4002FH5)
As module params I use card=59 tuner=0 for bttv and type=0 for tuner. 
These settings used to work fine before.
My system is debian/sid running kernel 2.6.5-3
I hope anyone of you can help me.
Thanks in advance
	Christian
