This is a good point. Noone has cared enough about LVM to work on it,
looking at the code in the kernel I cannot blame them. Sistina have
abandoned 2.5 LVM.
Has anyone actually sent patches to Linus removing LVM completely from
2.5 and adding the LVM2 device mapper? If I used LVM, I would have done
exactly that long ago. Linus, what's your oppinion on this?
