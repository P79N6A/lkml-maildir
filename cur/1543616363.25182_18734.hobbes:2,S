The other reason glibc uses mmap() is because your shared libraries
are (usually) mapped smack dab in the middle of your address space.
brk() assumes a contiguous heap, so when it hits your libraries, it
has to stop, even if there is a gig of VM above the libs.  mmap() can
give you an arbitrary chunk of the address space, so glibc uses it for
'large' allocations.
