new exciting result on exactly the same test (4Ganon mem +512m swap,
then started the bench):

I guess I cheated this time though :), see the _only_ change that I did to
speedup from 68/69 seconds to exactly 40 seconds:

I found we were hurted by not being able to use the full I/O pipeline
like we do for writes.
Now it swapouts constantly and regularly at 12.8 Mbyte/sec (still
smooth), the write throttling happens at the PG_launder layer like for
MAP_SHARED.
hdparm -t on the swap partition says 27 Mbyte/sec but that's unreal, at
least with writes, a cp flood at max runs at 17mbyte/sec on such scsi
disk where we also swapout to.  Without the above change it swapouts at
7.5 Mbyte/sec instead of 12.8 Mbyte/sec.  12.8Mbyte/sec seems acceptable
also considering the pagetable walking etc... more costly than a stright
generic_file_write + balance_dirty.
I'm aware of the implications of the above, we may empty the pfmemalloc
pool, but that should mostly cause some sched_yields, it still runs
stable during this test at least. I'd prefer to fix any places to
sched_yield rather than running at 7.5 mbyte/sec.
But my strongest non-cheat (and backwards compatibility, no too risk in
2.4) is that we just don't use the nr_async_pages during pageout to disk
of the MAP_SHARED segments, so why should we use it for pageout of the
anonymous memory that doesn't even need to pass through the fs? (in most
setups with a proper swap partition) As far as MAP_SHARED is just correct,
page_io.c also shouldn't need it. comments?
