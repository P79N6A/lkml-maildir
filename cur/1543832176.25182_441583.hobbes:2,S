As I've said in previous threads, I've had a much higher rate of
sucess with suspend2 than swsusp, much like others who are replying to
this thread. Can anyone tell me, did Suspend2 get veto'd? If not has
there been a clear laid-out plan of what needs to be done to get this
in to the kernel? Is adding new in-kernel suspend code not an option
now? This is not about eye-candy but simply getting computers to
suspend-to-disk. If that part of suspend2 never makes it into the
kernel I couldn't care less.
