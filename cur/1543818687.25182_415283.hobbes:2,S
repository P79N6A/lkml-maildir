OK, simplified rules; if you follow them you should generally be OK:
1. Changes to kernel --> GPL
2. Kernel driver --> GPL
3. Userspace code that uses interfaces that was not exposed to userspace
before you change the kernel --> GPL (but don't do it; there's almost
always a reason why an interface is not exported to userspace)
4. Userspace code that only uses existing interfaces --> choose
license yourself (but of course, GPL would be nice...)
5. Userspace code that depends on interfaces you added to the kernel
--> consult a lawyer (if this interface is something completely new,
you can *probably* use your own license for the userland part; if the
interface is more or less a wrapper of existing functionality, GPL)
And of course, I'm not a lawyer either...
