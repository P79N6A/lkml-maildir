Caps aren't about being fair.  In fact, giving a task a cap is an 
explicit instruction to the scheduler that the task should be treated 
unfairly in some circumstances (namely when it's exceeding that cap).
Similarly, the interactive bonus mechanism is not about fairness either. 
  It's about giving tasks that are thought to be interactive an unfair 
advantage so that the user experiences good responsiveness.
