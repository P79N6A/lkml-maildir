It happened because of 2.5.26, not just 2.5 in general.
Last night I changed a few things in the 2.5.31 configuration and now it
boots OK.
1) switched over to ACPI (was using APM before)
2) enabled CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO (which I didn't do before because I
   wasn't sure about the "VIA V2" warning in relation to my VIA chipset)
3) removed ATA_F_NOADMA from the chipset flags in ide-pci.c (chip id:
   PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_1)
I get the feeling that it is all DMA related, especially with my VIA
chip. I haven't seen any evidence of corruption, if that's what you mean by
'not stable'.

And on 2.5 systems, right?
