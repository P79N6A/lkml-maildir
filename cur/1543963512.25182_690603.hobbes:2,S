I think that's assuming too much?  PATA and SATA are quite different 
here... in PATA the status is mostly the value from the device directly 
off the wires.  in SATA, it may be from the device or from the 
controller.  And "smart" or firmware-based controllers may generate 
their own status, too, apart from the device's status.
So that results in varied status returns, and not all the time is a 
definite "ready" or "not ready" obvious.
