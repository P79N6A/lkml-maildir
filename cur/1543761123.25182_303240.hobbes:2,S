You are correct, it was a step forward in this direction.
But we now have a kref to handle the reference counting for the device,
which make things a whole lot easier than ever before.
But the both of you are correct, there is a real need for the class code
to support trees of devices that are presented to userspace (which is
what the class code is for).  I'm not taking that away, just trying to
make the interface to that code simpler.
I'm also not saying that I'm going to go off and delete those functions
from the kernel today, or tomorrow.  Just that we need to slowly, over
time, make this easier to use, as it's too hard to do so today.  I will
not be removing any functionality, don't worry :)

It will not make the reference counting logic easier to get wrong, or
easier to get right.  It totally takes it away from the user, and makes
them implement it themselves if they so wish (like the USB HCD patch
does.)
Anyway, don't worry, the code isn't going away anytime soon, we just
need to make it easier to use.  Any suggestions that any of you have to
make this that way (as you are the ones who had to use it to start with)
would be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
