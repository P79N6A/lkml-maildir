Ok. There has nothing else changed, that I could think of what could cause this.
The code in udev that prints this message looks like:
   err("symlink(%s, %s) failed: %s", linktarget, filename, strerror(errno));
That doesn't really match what you posted. Are there chars missing?
Can you please recheck?
And what does:
  udevtest /block/sdc
print?
Thanks,
Kay
