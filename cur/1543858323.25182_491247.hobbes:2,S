Btw, the other side of this argument is that if a user-space driver 
infrastructure can _not_ help the DRI kind of situation, then it's largely 
by definition not interesting. Merging something like that would just mean 
that we end up with multiple _different_ user-space helper infrastructure 
shells, which sounds distinctly unpalatable.
