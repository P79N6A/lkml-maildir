We really do need a linux-hotplug mailing list.  Who would be able to
set up such a list on vger.kernel.org (or anywhere else that supports
maillist archives and has decent server loads)?  I've already floated
this idea once, but noone who can make this happen has volunteered.
Why we need this:
There are too many people working on hotplug issues in disjoint corners
of the kernel and utility community.  This work requires coordination
from the various bus developers (USB, SCSI, PCI, IrDA, Firewire,
Wireless, etc.) as well as folks working on the usermode scripts,
utilities and so forth.  There is also the need to sort out all the
PCMCIA/Cardbus issues having to do with migrating the installed base
over time to the new kernel drivers (yenta and friends).
