I, for one, do not see any point in trying to put more and more crap
into one file, when its perfectly easy to just use the "cp" command
to produce the same end result, namely a copy of zImage, System.map
and configuration, thusly:
cp arch/$ARCH/boot/zImage /boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION
cp .config /boot/config-$VERSION
cp System.map /boot/System.map-$VERSION
No hastles with configuration options.  No hastles with bloated zImage
files.  No hastles with adding extra stuff to makefiles to do special
mangling to zImage.
If people are worried about vmlinuz being out of step with config, once
you add the above to the installation target of the kernel makefile,
unless you do things manually, you won't get out of step.
If you're worried about config-* and System.map-* being out of step with
the kernel you're running, exactly the same applies to the "everything
in one file" version as well.
If you need to make a backup of it:
mkdir /boot/old
cp /boot/*-$VERSION /boot/old
Nice.  Simple.  No crap.
