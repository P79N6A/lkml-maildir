ok, maybe the interaction was going the other way: I turned off vesa instead,
and atyfb works fine now. Only problem is that it starts up by default in
640x480 mode.
How does one switch modes properly at run time? I tried fbset, but that blanked
my screen. I have to switch modes _and_ tell the console driver or somebody that
it can change LINES & COLS or whatever it calls them, right?
I finally ended up editing atyfb.c and redefining default_var to be 1024x768. But
this is not The Right Way (tm).
