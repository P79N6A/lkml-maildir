please try sched-devel.git, which has both the latest scheduler fixes, 
and also the new "ftrace" latency tracing framework that can be used to 
trace various latency problems. You can pick up sched-devel.git via:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/sched-devel.git/README
firstly, there's a chance that sched-devel.git solves the problem - in 
that case please report it.
if it doesnt, then you can trace various latencies via these:
 CONFIG_FTRACE=y
 CONFIG_IRQSOFF_TRACER=y
 CONFIG_SCHED_TRACER=y
 CONFIG_CONTEXT_SWITCH_TRACER=y
 CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=y
just enable them, boot into the new kernel and mount debugfs:
   mount -t debugfs nodev /debug
and then you can select one of the tracers (that have been enabled in 
the .config) via /debug/tracing/* files. The usage of these files should 
be self-explaining - if any of them wasnt then please let us know and 
we'll make the "first quick glance experience" better :)
the one interesting to you would be the "wakeup" tracer. Enable it, and 
if you echo 0 into /debug/tracing/tracing_max_latency it starts tracking 
the worst-case delay experienced on your system and should start 
reporting them to the syslog.
if you encounter any problems during these steps then please let us know 
- this code is quite fresh so expect some rough edges.
