But I cannot see that the whole LRU list needs to be scanned during
unmount.
The only thing that does that is shrink_dcache_sb, which is used:
  in do_remount_sb
  in __invalidate_device
  in a few filesystems (autofs, coda, smbfs)
 and not when unmounting the filesystem (despite the comment).
(This is in 2.6.17-ec6-mm2).
I can see that shrink_dcache_sb could take a long time and should be
fixed, which should be as simple as replacing it with
shrink_dcache_parent; shrink_dcache_anon.
But I'm still puzzled as to why a long dcache LRU slows down
unmounting. 
Can you give more details?
Thanks,
NeilBrown
