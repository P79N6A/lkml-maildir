I think this would be cool, too.
I think simplicity is important, but more information is always helper.
I also like Daniel's suggestion of having the sender's _name_ by the
name attributed with the patch (or at least "BK Commit" or something).
But nothing _needs_ to be done.  This works great.  Good job, Dave and
Co.
