That's x86_64.  It turns out the dependency of "install" on "all" in the
project Makefile was causing .tmp_versions to be re-created.  Removing
the dependency on "all" fixes the problem.  This is the original rule:
install: all
        $(MAKE) $(KBUILD_FLAGS) modules_install \
                INSTALL_MOD_DIR=kernel/drivers/net/wireless
        $(DEPMOD) -ae
However, I'd rather keep the dependency of "install" on "all".  It's
better to compile a few files as root than to install out-of-date
modules.  I'm glad that your patch gives me a choice how to write the
project's Makefile.
