[I am cc'ing lkml, Andrew and Jens on this one, because I believe it
is probably a real world example of the oversized bio problem that I
was describing, although from fs/mpage.c, as Andrew Moreton
suggested.]

	I think your kernel panic is proably related to the
same problem that I addressed in ll_rw_kio, but, in fs/mpage.c
as Andrew Moreton suggested:
| Does this not also need to be done in fs/mpage.c? [...]
