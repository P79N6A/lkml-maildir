It is, thanks to modular arithmetic.
Let's imagine we use unsigned char instead of unsigned int (simpler
to explain), and we have a 200 bytes buffer.
At the beginning:
	head = tail = 0
We add 200 bytes:
	head = 0, tail = 200
We extract 200 bytes:
	head = 200, tail = 200
We add 200 bytes more:
	head = 200, tail = (200 + 200) % 256 = 144
Now the buffer length is:
	144 - 200 = (-56) % 256 = 200
Thanks to modular arithmetic magic, we get the correct answer: 200.
Stelian.
