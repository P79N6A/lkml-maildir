I believe that netdump needs to requeue things because dropping the
packet is simply not allowed, and the ->drop callback gives the
netdump code a way to handle things without actually dropping the
packet.  If that's true, you can't just free the SKB on it.
Are you sure your new TX strategy can avoid such drops properly?
Please take a quick peek at the netdump code, it's available, and make
some reasonable effort to determine whether it can still work with
your new code.
