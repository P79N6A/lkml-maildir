I was reaching inside my computer to check something and heared the thing 
click and got the same error message.
Turns out the adaptor that goes between SATA drive and the old style power 
connector was loose on the drive side.  Doesn't seem to me like it was 
very snug fitting to begin with.  I changed it to one of the proper SATA 
connectors comming off the power supply and it doesn't do that anymore.
Sorry for the false alarm, 
	Gerhard
