I'd really suggest just filling in the e820 table from the EFI information 
early at boot.
(Even better would be for the EFI bootloader on x86 to just fill things in 
_as_if_ it was filling in e820 data, but that's outside of the kernel, so 
if you want the _kernel_ to be able to handle native EFI data, do it by 
just translating it once into e820 mode, and you're done).
The translation from EFI to e820 format should be very straightforward 
indeed. I think it's pretty much the same thing with different naming.
