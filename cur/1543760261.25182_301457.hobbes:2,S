The answer is the same: I'd still like to have somebody (preferably Sam)  
who is comfortable with all the build scripts get a revision-control-
specific version at build-time, so that BK users would get the top-of-tree 
key value, and other people could get some CVS revision or something.
I don't want to tag things just randomly, especially as it would be very
error-prone (read: I'd forget). A script that looks at the top revision,
and if it's not a tag, takes the key value and appends it to the build
version seems to be The Right Thing (tm). 
I have this dim memory that Sam might even have had some early trials, but 
maybe thats just wishful thinking.. Sam?
