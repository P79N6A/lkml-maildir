Someone please explain:
(1) why exporting this information from the kernel in the arguably most
    useful form --- a virtual filesystem --- is more evil than exporting it
    as e.g. a /proc file or a generator sysctl();
(2) why devfs detractors all think devfs somehow *has* to be mounted on /dev,
    when clearly it doesn't (and it's IMHO even more useful when mounted on
    /devices, with a devfsd / vold to tend to hot-swappable devices).
(And (2a) I'd like to know why hpa asserted that "devfs is only useful if
everyone uses it and mounts it on /dev" (paraphrased).  Huh?  I missed
something, apparently.)
At this point I'm pretty sure that the devfs boosters and detractors are
arguing past each other and nothing's going to be accomplished until they're
both talking about the same thing.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
