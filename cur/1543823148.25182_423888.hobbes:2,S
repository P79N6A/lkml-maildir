Roland,
What should these patches apply against?
I have tried rc4 and a number of them fail, and I have also
tried one of your gits (though maybe not the right one), and
at least some of the the same patches seem to fail to apply
there.
If I can get an idea what they should apply to I will apply them
against that and see how things look.
I have at least one of the nasty bugs that I know about.
