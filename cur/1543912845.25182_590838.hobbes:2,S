To be fair to Roman, he probably started development off an earlier CFS,
most probably 2.6.23-rc3-git1, if I guess correctly from his original
posting. So it's likely he missed out on some of the tunings/comments(?)
etc code that got merged after that.

Again, it would be interesting to benchmark against 2.6.23-rc3-git1. And
also probably rediff vs 2.6.23-rc3-git1 and compare how the code actually
changed ... but admittedly, doing so would be utterly pointless, because
much water has flowed down the Ganges since -rc3 (misc CFS improvements,
Peter's patches that you mentioned). So a "look, I told you so" kind of
situation wouldn't really be constructive at all.

Absolutely. And if there indeed are net improvements (be it for corner
cases) over latest CFS-rc5, while maintaining performance for the common
cases at the same time, well, that can only be a good thing.
Just my Rs. 0.02,
