Hi all...
I have just remembered that udev mounts /dev as a tmpfs filesystem, _on top_
of the old /dev directory. I have just booted to single user mode,
and checked that the old /dev is wasting around 13000 files (inodes) in my
box. Space is not an issue, that is around 480 Kb.
A couple questions:
- Is it possible to boot with an empty /dev, until udev builds it ?
- If this is not the case, which are the minimal nodes that should be
  present ?
- For any answer to previous question, shouldn't the distro set up minimal
  /dev (empty or with a few nodes) and _delete_ the old /dev tree ?
I don't remember exactly, but there are scripts at initscripts run before
udev. As I understand it, udev should be the very first thing to run, as
anything after it will probably need a /dev/something....
Why my simple logic does not work ?
(As I CC both cooker and LKML, this is a cooker specific question: could anybody
who has installed 10.1 from scratch, ie not an update, boot to runlevel 1 and
list his /dev)
TIA
