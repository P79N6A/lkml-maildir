Hi Alan,
sndconfig still locked up on me with the cs46xx driver in -ac6, but I found 
the culprit. Too lazy to figure out how to officially submit a patch, but the 
body should look like what I attached.
Looks like you're too pessimistic. If everything works OK first time you 
don't believe it. Oh well, looking at your diary, given all those 
contractors I can't blame your mindset ;-)
Grtz,
