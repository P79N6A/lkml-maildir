     I don't know what you're doing with the machine, but these things tend not
to happen to a machine sitting their idle.  But run a million hit/day web
server, or a news server taking a full feed (which is what I'm doing on these
two machines), and race conditions and the like tend to surface much faster.
     It's not impossible that the problem isn't specific to Ross Hypersparc
as opposed to Supersparc (was that Texas Instruments?).
     I also haven't tried 2.2.7, I kept hearing evil things about it, some
security related.  Maybe it would be worth a try.

     As I mentioned, the 4/670's are retired, but the 670 is perhaps 50% again
as wide as the 630 case, they have a 12-slot VME cage with drive bays on top of
that.  They're large, heavy, and suck an enourmous amount of electricity and
kick out a large amount of heat which was the primary incentive for their
retirement.
