 I just read through the reiserfs source again. The only change that occurs to
ANY core functionality is the read_inode2 functionality. Which could easily
have a CONFIG_MAGIC_READ_INODE_COOKIE_OR_SOMETHING put around it. So including
the ReiserFS patch would not affect anyone who disables it, as per JFFS, and
earlier statements. So, the previous arguments about JFFS LEGITIMIZE ReiserFSs
inclusion since it doesn't affect users who don't want it.
The memory pressure issues are non-issues to the people allready using
ReiserFS. Even if ReiserFS is compiled into the kernel, the issues will not
affect a user until they mount a ReiserFS partition. And if they are doing
that, they probably know what they are doing.
So forgive my ignorance what are the missing technical merits here? Writing a
journaling FS on top of Linux's VM without patching it directly is at least a
major technical accomplishment -- I definately know this...
So, in summa, we're changing the VM that affects EVERY subsytem in the kernel
during the 2.4 release, and refuse to integrate a patch that gives people an
optional subsystem. Sounds like a feature freeze to me! Smells like something
else...
