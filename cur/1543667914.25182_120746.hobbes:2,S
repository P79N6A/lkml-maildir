i think we're agreeing on the same thing here!
yes, i believe topology discovery should only belong in userspace.
i believe it should be in userspace for both (a) setup and (b) at 
kernel-boot-time
likewise, i believe policy of deciding what mix of i/o's to put down 
different paths also belongs in userspace.
this could take the form of a daemon that frequently looks up statistics 
from the kernel (e.g. average latency per target), and uses that 
information in conjunction with some 'policy' to tweak what paths are used.
but i definitely don't think that the kernel should make any wide-ranging 
decisions about multiple paths, except beyond something like "deviceA has 
disappeared.  i know that deviceB is an alternate path, so will swing all 
outstanding i/o plugged into A to B".
cheers,
lincoln.
