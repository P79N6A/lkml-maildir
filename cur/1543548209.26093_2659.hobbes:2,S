And here's another sample output for you:
CPU 1: Machine Check Exception: 0000000400000000<0>Bank 0: f200010000000800general protection fault: 0000
CPU:    1
EIP:    0010:[mcheck_fault+263/368]
EFLAGS: 00010246
...
I seldom get a log entry, most of the time I get the first line on all my
xterms and then a hard lock.
And Alan, in case you don't know about it, there's a kernel module
that reports RAM ECC errors at 
http://www.anime.net/~goemon/linux-ecc/
It seems related, maybe you will find some of the code useful.
Thanks again
Andrew
