Looks interesting for saving debug info between re-boots, but I was thinking more of reserving an area at the top of system memory, (say 4 megs), and putting a root filesystem, and some kernel images there.
The theory being that if you haven't got a hard disk, (e.g. nodes of a beowulf cluster), doing a warm boot to change kernels is 'expensive', because you're either booting from a floppy over the LAN.
Alternatively, you could preserve the in-memory filesystem cache between re-boots, (although why anyone should be re-booting that much, I don't know).
