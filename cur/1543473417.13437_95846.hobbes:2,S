Hi,
Since 2.2.0-pre1 is still quite hard to get hold of and
a 10Mbit connection is a shame to waste, I decided to put
a copy up for grabs at this address:
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/pub/mirror/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/
ftp://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/pub/mirror/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/
It's a 10 Mbit connection on a university where everybody
is still taking their Christmas and New Year's days off so
it should be reasonably fast to people in this part of the
world...
cheers,
