	This patch makes the comments match for icache,dcache,dqcache   shrink 
functions.  Initially the comment stated that a priority of 0 could be used, 
but after looking into mm/vmscan.c::shrink_caches this cannot be true.  So 
the comment now states that 1 is the highest priority.  This appears __really 
true as at priority 1 all of the cache possible is removed.
	Also shrink_dqcache_memory now uses the count variable like everyone else.
	Possibly incorrect __GFP_FS check added to the dqcache function.  but again 
consistancy is my goal.  
	Another dqcache issue in that the dqcache was being shrunk at priority+1 
rather than at priority, this looked suspect, and with no comment around the 
code, it to has been remanded to consistancy.
Well, here goes.    Any comments and/or b#$chslaps welcome.  This is my first 
attempted patch after studying the VFS layer for a while, so please be 
(fairly) kind.
	Craig.
