First of all, asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h is there to share common code 
where possible, so if it's not possible, you still have the option of 
having your own special code in arch/$(ARCH)/vmlinux.lds.S
Having said that, you could add
	#define TEXT_MEM > flash
at the beginning of arch/m68knommu/vmlinux.lds.S
and
	#ifndef TEXT_MEM
	#define TEXT_MEM
	#endif
at the beginning of include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h and then change
	.text : {
		*(.text)
-	}
+	} TEXT_MEM
Would that work for you?
