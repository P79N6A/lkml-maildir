One of the things which previous changes have done is to move us away
from "port types" towards "capabilities" for serial ports, so things
like the FIFO, hardware flow control and so forth can be individually
controlled, rather than having to rely on a table of features.
So, it appears that OMAP ports are like a TI752 port, but with a couple
of extra features.  Can we use the existing TI75x feature support code
for these ports?
Also, these ports seem to use extra address space which isn't covered by
a request_region/request_mem_region... that's something which should be
fixed.

The set of UART_FCR6_xxx definitions are only left here for compatibility -
there are others which use this file.  Because the trigger levels is very
dependent on the chip and sometimes which other features are enabled, I
decided to provide new definitions:
#define UART_FCR_R_TRIG_00      0x00
#define UART_FCR_R_TRIG_01      0x40
#define UART_FCR_R_TRIG_10      0x80
#define UART_FCR_R_TRIG_11      0xc0
#define UART_FCR_T_TRIG_00      0x00
#define UART_FCR_T_TRIG_01      0x10
#define UART_FCR_T_TRIG_10      0x20
#define UART_FCR_T_TRIG_11      0x30
with a table above which detail their effects.  I think it's silly creating
lots of definitions for these bits, and then ending up with lots of macros
definiting the same sort of thing.  Please use the above only.
