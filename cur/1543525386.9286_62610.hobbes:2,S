I was looking at 2.3.43-pre8 but that is history now, so assume I was
talking about 2.3.44-pre3. 
Anyway, I put a printk() in kswapd() just before it goes to sleep
and before it does the work showing the jiffies value and proved that it
does *NOT* go to sleep every second so the comments are wrong. Here is the
patch (and cc:Linus)
