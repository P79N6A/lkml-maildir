 Hello Stephan,
 I'm sorry but I don't have much idea.  That looks like a deadlock on
io_request_lock, which I think is very unlikely, or maybe another cpu
got io_request_lock and hung.  I've also found out that the bh race I
thought I found didn't exist due to the order of spin_trylock() and
hardirq_trylock() tests in bh_action().  So, only the first
irq_enter() related race is valid.  I've been trying to reproduce your
kernel hang condition with reiserfs and nfs from yesterday without
success.
