So those clients can use helper functions to use their own namespaces. 
If they happen to group things in the same way they they'll all end up
using the same nsproxy.

I don't necessarily agree with the 'heirarchy' bit.  It doesn't have to
be so segregated.  But I think we already covered that in this thread.
I agree with the comment on the abuse of the term "namespace", though
consider that it has already been abused with the term IPC namespaces. 
We have for some time been using it to refer to groupable entities
within the kernel that are associated with tasks, even if they don't
involve named entities that clash within a particular domain.  But there
is always an entity and a domain, and that is the key point I'm trying
to make - the features you are putting forward are no different to the
examples that we made specifically for the purpose of setting the
standard for further features to follow.
We talked about naming a bit before, see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/21/403
 and possibly other threads.  So,
anyway, feel free to flog this old dead horse and suggest different
terms.  We've all had long enough to think about it since so maybe it's
worth it, but with any new term it should be really darned clear that
they're essentially the same thing as namespaces, or otherwise be really
likable.
