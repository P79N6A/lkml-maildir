Hi,
Firstly, please cc me into any any replies - I'm not subscribed.
In 2.6.25 kernels, my wireless LAN dies after even the smallest amount
of network activity. The following screen cut shows what I typically
see:

As you can see, after a few packets, the ping application hangs and
after that point, all network accesses fail. There are no error
messages written to the logs when the network dies. I can restart the
network by simply unloading and reloading the driver. This hang does
not occur with a different wireless card that uses the rtl8180 driver.
My config and the output from dmesg (after reloading the driver) are
attached. I have Ralink debugfs enabled so can provide any additional
diagnostics that may be helpful from that source.
(I should perhaps add that I am sure that this is not the same problem
I reported tthrough bugzilla (bug 9860) a few weeks ago, which it
seems was a problem with my AP/router. Since resetting my AP/Router, I
can reboot to 2.6.24.2 and the wireless network works reliably with
the same hardware.)
The hardware is a Belkin F5D7010 802.11g Notebook card communicating
with a Draytek Vigor 2600 802.11b combined AP/Router/Broadband Modem.
I will be more than happy to provide additional diagnostics, but
please bear in mind that I am not a git user, so cannot do bisects. I
am, however, perfectly capable of applying or reverting patches,
rebuilding and re-testing, so I am quite happy to do that.
Thanks in advance.
Chris
