The 32bit PIO support is already queued up and went to Jeff a while ago
so thats all in hand - its btw a big win on some suprising chipset cases
including Intel ICH chipsets.

Its still broken. You cannot use the version check for versions below 3.
I remain unconvinced we should be looking at it anywhere except specific
pure ISA cycle pass through hardware and thus it belongs as a helper for
those drivers not as ata_has_mumble stuff as its not ATA - eide_* maybe.
Doubly complicating it is the small detail that ATA1 devices don't
all respond to IDENTIFY in the first place....
