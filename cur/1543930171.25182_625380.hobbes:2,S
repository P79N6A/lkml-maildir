I don't see any PT_TRACED flag in current kernel HEAD ?
Hrm, let's see. If we share TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE with ptrace, we would then
have to figure out how to get this working :
- kernel tracing activated
- ptracing some random processes
- kernel tracing deactivated
- stop ptracing those processes
It means that we would have to keep some state information about the
ptrace status of each process. This is currently kept by
TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE, but since we would be overloading it, it would be
lost when we deactivate kernel tracing. Adding a supplementary field to
the thread_info structure is out of question here : we have to keep it
as small as possible. So where do you propose to keep this information
other than... another thread flag ?
