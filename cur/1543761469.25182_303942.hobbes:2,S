well, I don't specially wan't to be immediate.
My hardware has "auto flow control" and a 8 bytes
fifo...So *whatever* the trigger level is for RTS
(actually I can't tune it), I will overrun because 
the end *driver*, which should be aware of the lack of
its "hw auto flow control", decides to fill up its tx
fifo to 8 bytes when transmiting...
One other solution may be to give the possibility of
the user to tune the size of tx fifo ?
thanks
