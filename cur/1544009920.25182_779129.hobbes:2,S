Oops, didn't finish that sentence.
I agree that you'd need some kind of hierarchical-restart. But I'd
like to play with / look at your cgroup-id patch more closely and see
if we can come up with something simpler that still does what you
want.
One particular problem with the patch as it stands is that the ids
should be per-css, not per-cgroup, since a css can move between
hierarchies and hence between cgroups. (Currently only at bind/unbind
time, but it still results in a cgroup change).
