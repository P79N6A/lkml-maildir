Subject: Getting very high CPU-load with new acpi

I own a fujitsu-siemens lifebook C6155.
With several linux-kernels containing the new acpi (2.5.x, 2.4.21+patch,
2.4.21-ac1), I get very high CPU-load every few seconds. It's even
impossible to listen mp3s.
top shows me that it's the process events on 2.5-kernels and keventd on
2.4-kernels. This does not happen with 2.4.21-vanilla (without
acpi-patch, but with acpi enabled and working).
So the bug seems to be in the new acpi-system.
