Subject: bug in 2.6.22-rc2: loop mount limited to one single iso image

Hi,
I am running Debian Etch 4.0 stable in connection with udev.
In kernel 2.6.22-rc2 the number of available loop mounts is reduced from 8 (conventional standard of preceding 2.6 kernels) to 1.
Symptom: If you try to mount more than one single iso-image with
the loop parameter you are receiving the following message during system boot:
"mount: could not find any free loop device"
Kernel 2.6.20.11 does not show that problem.
Question: Can someone reading this confirm and reproduce that problem?
If yes: Are there any fixes available?
Thanks and Regards
Uwe
