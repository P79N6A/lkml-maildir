Subject: question on accessing device nodes for drivers that are not loaded

I'm working on 2.6.9.  I wrote a driver as a module that binds in as a misc char 
device.
I created the node for it manually, tested loading/unloading, running, etc.
Then I unloaded the driver, and tried running my little test app.  It appears to 
have hung on the call to open the device node (for which there was no driver 
loaded).  Top shows it in D state.  Then I went to load the driver module, and 
the insmod command hung with a refcount of 1.
Is this expected behaviour?
