That is great to hear.  Hopefully the reiserfs people will clean
it up for 2.3.x soon.  If it is not ready in time for 2.4
inclusion, would it be possible for inclusion in 2.4.x for some
low number of x so long as it doesn't muck with many kernel
internals?
A journalled fs would be great indeed, but not at risk of kernel
stability.
I'm glad to see that you're considering it though.
