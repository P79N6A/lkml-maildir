A compile-standalone test is a necessary condition but not a sufficient
one. There can be many reasons why the includes might still be needed:
 - the compile-test might depend on the specific configuration.
 - the included header might be needed when the macros are used, not when
   they are defined.
 - indirect includes
 - ...
As you probably know, I tried to clean up sched.h, and it was extremely
complicated to get right. So this definitely is 2.7 material.
