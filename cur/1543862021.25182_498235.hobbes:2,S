Hi all,
Opening file with O_DIRECT flag can do the un-buffered read/write access.
So if I need un-buffered access, I have to change all of my
applications to add this flag. What's more, Some scripts like "cp
oldfile newfile" still use pagecache and buffer.
Now, my question is, is there a existing way to mount a filesystem
with O_DIRECT flag? so that I don't need to change anything in my
system. If there is no option so far, What is the right way to achieve
my purpose?
Thanks a lot.
