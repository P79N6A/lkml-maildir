Can you test this patch? It turns out that "get_cpu()/put_cpu()" are not 
enough - on UP they don't actually disable preemption, since the CPU 
number itself is perfectly stable at 0, of course.
But we need to disable preemption while we re-load esp0, since if we
schedule at that point our esp0 cache in the TSS structures will become
out-of-sync with the actual value of the CPU esp0.
You'd obviously have to re-enable preemption to test this, please..
