Those are not really random, the list of IO regions available is given
in the ACPI SPIC device specification. The list is hardcoded here
because the driver does not (yet ?) use the ACPI services for
initializing the device, and experience has shown that the list does not
vary with different models.

this cannot be done, because the regions are already defined, and are
not in the legacy area.

sure, but the SPIC device is not really tied to a specific PCI device
(it is for the 'type1' models, but not for the 'type2' ones). That's why
the sonypi driver is not a PCI driver but relies on a DMI ident to
detect each and every Vaio laptop out there.
