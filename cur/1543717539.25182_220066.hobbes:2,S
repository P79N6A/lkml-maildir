Set CPU affinity to route IRQ to a specific CPU? :)

I looked through the USB and unless I miss something it does not use
tasklets there. Also, even if I save the registers in IRQ context and
pass it to tasklet I do not see how I can reconstruct the call trace -
tasklet execution can be passed to ksoftirqd and executed with
completely different stack. The output would lie horribly.
Also, while I was looking at USB implementation - it also drags pt_regs
pointer everywhere for SysRq handling only and no other benefits. The
data is foreign and unneeded for both input and USB systems.
What is the objection to printing the trace at do_IRQ time and having
SysRq merely post a request instead of executing it?
Thank you,
Dmitry
