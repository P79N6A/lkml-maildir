You've probably not seen the AIX VM architecture.  Good for you as it's
not good for your stomache.  I did when I still was SCAldera and although
my NDAs don't allow me to go into details I can tell you that the AIX
VM architecture is deeply tied into the segment architecture of the Power
CPU and signicicantly different from any other UNIX variant.
So porting code from AIX that touches anything VM related is a complete
rewrite.
Nice argumentation though, for everything but AIX it might actually have
worked :)
