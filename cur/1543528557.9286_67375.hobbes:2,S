I was wrong about OSS/Commercial. You can still use it even when you
enable sound support in the kernel, but you have to compile soundcore
as a module AND make sure it's not loaded when you load OSS AND alias
char-major-14 off in conf.modules. It's a pain :-)

Have you tried it? It doesn't! Here are my modules in 2.2.14 (after
editing .config and manually adding CONFIG_VIDEO_MSP3400):
Module                  Size  Used by
lockd                  32200   1  (autoclean)
sunrpc                 54628   1  (autoclean) [lockd]
tuner                   2340   1 
msp3400                 8976   1 
bttv                   33664   0  (unused)
i2c                     3904   3  [tuner msp3400 bttv]
videodev                2720   3  [bttv]
The kernel is compiled without sound support.
Of course you won't get any sound _through_ your sound card without
sound support, but the tv card _does_ work, including msp3400. You can
plug your headphones in or connect it to your stereo if you don't have
any sound card at all.
As Gerd said, msp3400 depends on soundcore _if you enable sound
support in the kernel_. But if you leave it out it does not.

Have you tried to compile the kernel _with no sound support at all_?
Try it, you'll see it works.
