If we envision a need of it in the future, we'd better put it in
today. It would be nice to have the revision number at beginning of
the struct. Shailabh's instruction says to add new field after existing
fields.

I am sorry that i did not make myself clear. My suggestion of using
the bitmask payload info is to be combined with #ifdef CONFIG_* to
eliminate unnecessary fields from the traffic. I am concerned about
losing data due to application not reading data fast enough.
Well, we can revisit this suggestion when we start losing data
though. ;-)
