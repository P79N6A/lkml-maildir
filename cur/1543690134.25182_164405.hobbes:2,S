That is probably the right model. We do something similar with dual
function parallel/serial cards and of course on a huge scale with USB
where a USB hub means loading many other drivers to use the devices 
attached to it.

Yes. request_module() and the hotplug interface let you do that in
various kernels. Right now for example the USB layer goes back to the
userspace /sbin/hotplug and says "I need a driver for one of these" and
the hotplug layer figures out what to do.

Syncppp is pretty basic and obsoleted by the hdlc driver stuff.

Take a look at the Zaptel stuff, thats basically the T1 version of a
winmodem but might have some interesting ideas in it.

I've seen people do this in user space (just interleaving the disk in
big chunks in the app and driving it with O_DIRECT raw access) but not
in kernel file system space.
