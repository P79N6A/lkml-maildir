Oh, right. Sorry, I should have said 'init()' or 'setup()' rather than 
'start()'. 
In many drivers there are two discrete operations that happen in the 
probe() method: verifying the device can be claimed, and registering the 
interfaces. By breaking it into two calls, you can conceptually separate 
the actions. It would also give the bus a chance to intercept the call and 
perform whatever housekeeping it needed to do at that point, giving James 
what he wanted.
However, I don't see a great benefit of doing this, besides making it 
_blatantly_ obvious what each call is supposed to do. The driver can call 
the bus to perform housekeeping duties during the setup (probe()) period, 
and everything should be happy.
