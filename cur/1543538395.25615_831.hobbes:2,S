Subject: test3-pre5: compile error in LVM (unused function)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
The following function in include/linux/blk.h (line 437) is unused with
my .config:
#ifndef LOCAL_END_REQUEST	/* If we have our own end_request, we do not want to include this mess */
#if ! SCSI_BLK_MAJOR(MAJOR_NR) && (MAJOR_NR != COMPAQ_SMART2_MAJOR)
static void end_request(int uptodate) {
	struct request *req = CURRENT;
	if (end_that_request_first(req, uptodate, DEVICE_NAME))
		return;
#ifndef DEVICE_NO_RANDOM
	add_blkdev_randomness(MAJOR(req->rq_dev));
#endif
	DEVICE_OFF(req->rq_dev);
	blkdev_dequeue_request(req);
	end_that_request_last(req);
}
#endif /* ! SCSI_BLK_MAJOR(MAJOR_NR) */
#endif /* LOCAL_END_REQUEST */
#endif /* (MAJOR_NR != SCSI_TAPE_MAJOR) */
#endif /* defined(MAJOR_NR) || defined(IDE_DRIVER) */
Due to -Werror, this gives an error during compilation.
My .config is:
