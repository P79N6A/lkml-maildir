Hi Joe.

That accounts for about 99% of the models out there...
 > 2. Easy to configure under both Linux and NT
Linux:	1. Install UPS driver.
	2. Edit /etc/inittab to add relevant lines.
Win9x:	1. Follow instructions from "Add new hardware" dialog.
WinNT:	No idea so no comment.

The usual specification is 20 minutes of reserve power, although
some more upmarket models specify 30 minutes.

Most UPS provide an 'on reserve power' signal, and the usual
configuration is for the assertion of that signal to cause the
computer to prepare for shutdown. Something like the following
being run when it gets asserted...
 Q> shutdown -h -t 15 +15 'PowerFail: System Shutdown.'
...with the following if the said signal gets de-asserted during
that time...
 Q> shutdown -c 'PowerBack: Shutdown cancelled.'
...to make sure that the shutdown only completes if the power-out is
an extended one.
 > 5. Must be SMP friendly (shouldn't make a difference)
It doesn't.
 > 6. Around $100..
Not sure about dollars, but they're around UKP 130 - that translates
to around US $200 at current exchange rates, but all too often, that
translation does not apply.
Best wishes from Riley.
