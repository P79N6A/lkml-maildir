He of course has an ADSL USB modem (sice he uses uEagle-ATM driver)...
So one obvious test that Arkadiusz can make is to try to crash 2.6.18
without using his modem: just detach the USB cable before boot so the
driver isn't loaded (and even if it's loaded by a "modprobe" in
init scripts, it can't do much).
