A follow-up to my previous report about 2.2.18 bttv's new (worse) behavior:
Replacing 2.2.18's bttv.c with 2.2.17's fixes the problems.
- The green and purple fuzzy flash on a screen capture or channel change is
  gone.
- The screen works after loading the module without TV->Composite->TV in
  XawTV. (Especially important with automatic module loading.)

I can try to narrow it down further if someone has ideas or I'll just try
whatever I can in the large chunks changed.
