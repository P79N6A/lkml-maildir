Are you sure this is actually a problem?  Can you really exec these
files, or is it just a matter of the flag?  Some changes were made
to mount flags by Al Viro.  If you really want the flags gone, you
should use a different umask (e.g. umask=111).  The noexec flag
means (for filesystems that actually have permissions) that _even if_
the "x" bit is set, it cannot be executed.
Cheers, Andreas
