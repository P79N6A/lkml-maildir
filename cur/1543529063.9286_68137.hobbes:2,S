Hmm. It does (as you yourself said below).

It does. When you link statically you are creating "binary blob" out of
library and program and you can not replace library with other version
later. With dynamic linking you are creating just references to library
in your programs and components are still chnageable afterwards (you can
replace glibc 2.1 instead of glibc 2.0 or you can replace program binary
without replacing library). So static linking and dynamic linking are two
VERY different acts legally: statically linked library is part of you product,
dynamically linked library is merely requirement. That's why StarOffice consist
basically of one (ONE!) huge binary and separately distributed glibc's binary
AFAIK (is there any other reason?).

Effectively this means what I've said: you can link dynamically but not
statically :-) If you REALLY need static link then yes, you can provide
all object files. For any free software (not only GPL'ed one) this mean
that static linking with LGPL'ed library is legal though so I painted
picture with little too wide brush initially :-/
AB> IANAL, but you can look it up in section 6 of the LGPL for yourself.
Exactly.
