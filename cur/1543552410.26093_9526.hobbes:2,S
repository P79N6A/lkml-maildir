A phyical address is the address the CPU uses to talk to memory.  It is not
necessarily the same kind of address a device uses to see memory: they use
bus addresses.  The simple case is bus address == physical address, but 
there are many variations.  Systems with an IOMMU (or equiv) present devices
with a completely different view of system memory.
