There's one _practical_ thing you need to keep in mind: you'll either
need 'C++'-clean kernel headers (to interface low-level kernel
functions) or a separate set of headers.
For separate headers, I see the problem of keeping them synchronized
with the kernel. The clean-up-kernel-headers-for-userspce-consumption
guys already took that bullet once and up to now, there's no "real"
result. (That's while we all know that kernel values *are* somewhat
for the userspace guys:-)  I see an even smaller user-base for
separate C++ kernel headers (and thus more work per person)--and I
think that the current in-kernel headers just won't be C++ compatible,
ever[*].
