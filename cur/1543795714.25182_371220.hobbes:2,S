Subject: Too many disks in system? (RAID5)

Hello,
I have system with attached SATA array which contains 24 disks. I wanted to run
software RAID 5, but 24 disks means, that I would need /dev/sda to /dev/sdx
devices with major 8 and last minor 384. Minor seems to be limited to 8 bits.
Is there any chance to run software array using all 24 disks?
My test was with mknod v. 5.2.1 and kernel 2.6.14.3
