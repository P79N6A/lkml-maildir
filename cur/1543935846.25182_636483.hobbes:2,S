These emails again are getting really long, but I think the gist of
Indan's suggestion can be concisely summarized:
	"To confine process P3 to /dev/hda2 being 'b 3 2', create
	/dev/p3, launch P3 in a new mounts namespace, mount --bind
	/dev/p3 /dev, exec what you want p3 running, and have
	MAC prevent umount /dev/p3."
This is a neat idea, but Tetsuo's rebutall is
	"P3 may be legacy code needing to create or delete
	/dev/floppy, where -EPERM confuses P3 and prevents
	it working correctly."
Indan's idea is interesting and I like it, but is there an answer to
Tetsuo's problem with it?
thanks,
-serge
PS - Indan, you also said in essence "if P3 can be trusted to create
/dev/floppy why can't it be trusted to create /dev/hda1".  I trust that,
phrased that way, the question answers itself?
