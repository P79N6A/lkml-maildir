Mmm.. definite regression with -final versus -rc6.
My Latitude-X1 notebook loses video on resume-from-ram
with -final.  Worked fine with all versions from 2.6.16
through 2.6.18-rc6.  So something at the last moment broke it.
I'm travelling with it all this month, with only occasional
access here.  But any suggestions of *specific* patches to
try reverting would be welcome.  git-bisect is a non-starter.
Cheers
