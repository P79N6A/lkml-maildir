With six gigs of memory, it looks like the VM has gone nuts
trying to locate some reclaimable lowmem.
Suggest you send the contents of /proc/meminfo and /proc/slabinfo,
captured during a period of misbehaviour.
Then please apply 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1.bz2
and send a report on the outcome.
