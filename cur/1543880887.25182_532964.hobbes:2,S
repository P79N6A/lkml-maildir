We can map arbitrary 4k chunks of larger pages.

We are not doing superpages in any form. The filesystem determines it page 
cache size thereby managing pages of arbitrary order. The usual VM 
mmap will work using PAGE_SIZEd mappings as now (once that is working 
right). There is no need to tie the page cache order to the page sizes 
used by mmap or the sizes used by the fault handling of the VM.
