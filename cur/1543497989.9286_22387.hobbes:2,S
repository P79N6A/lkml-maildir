I2O controllers have two resource needs not currently handled
1.	The want to be able to allocate physical address space that is free.
	This isn't used by any I2O 1.5 controller I know of, but I2O 2.0
	requires it for hot-plug (for the same reason the host OS will)
2.	The i2o controller can claim devices it can access from its bus
	(normally just PCI devices). For MCA bus we have the notion of
	claiming a device (mark_as_used/mark_as_unused), we need the
	equivalent for PCI etc too. A good API would probably be
	mark_as_used_by(struct bus_host *) or similar.

Intel Xeon - 32bit void* 36 bit addressing for one. If we want to support
this lets not dig a hole now. physaddr_t as was suggested by JJ seems smart

Ok so we want the option for ioremap_be and ioremap_le if supported.
