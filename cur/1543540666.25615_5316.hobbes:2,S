Hi!
While I was going through the Linux Device Drivers book by Allessandro
Rubini, I came to know that at the time of 286 computers, ISA memory was
mapped between 15 and 16MB for RAM. Since at that time nobody had more than
1-2 MB of RAM, people had no problems accessing the ISA memory. 
But now, as everybody has around 64MB RAM, so when we access that memory
between 15 and 16MB (the ISA memory hole), are we referring to physical RAM
or to ISA card's memory?
Where can I get more details on this?
PS: Since I am not a member of this mailing list, please CC me the reply.
Thanks & Regards,
