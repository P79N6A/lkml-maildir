Grr, I just shouldn't do last minute changes without testing. Anyway, 
I just put a fixed version into the same place 
(patch-2.5.24-kg2.{gz,bz2}).
(It still has some rough edges which need work, but it should at least 
get the job done)
However, I don't see why you get a failed hunk it applies cleanly against 
a bitkeeper v2.5.24 tree here. (Could you mail me the .rej file, 
privately).
Thanks for testing.
