Subject: Spam with vger.kernel.org return address

I've received at least two unsolicited e-mails (possibly more, but I get so much crap, I generally send it straight to /dev/null), both relating to sex, with
vger.kernel.org return addresses. Who is the best person to contact about it?
It's really bad to click on an e-mail I think is from this list, find an image of a naked woman, and hope to God my boss doesn't come by before I can delete it.
