There are several Linux on microkernel implementations around, thankfully 
using something that can really be called a microkernel. With the "we
want to run 10,000 copies of Linux on a box" market boom it may well prove
to have a practical use one day - as well as the security partitioning one
which some people overlook (and paranoid security people often do not mind
a small performance hit)
