Nice to see again a two cutting-edge-killing opinions.
Every time I really wonder, how such brilliant hackers can be that stupid
that they can not have cake and eat it the same time, and have to scratch
each-others eyes every time.
Use macros.
Kernel has become so big that it really needs universal  debugging macros
instead of comments. Comments are waste of brain&fingerpower, if the same
can be explained by long variable names and debug macros.
static Subsystem_module_LocalVariableForThisPurpose;
int Subsytem_module_function_this_and_that(){
	DEBUG_ASSERT( Subsystem_module_LocalVariableForThisPurpose  == 0 );
	DEBUG_ASSERT(MOST_OF_TIME,FS_AREA,MYFS_MODULE, somethingaboutIndodes->node != NULL )
}
Those macros would be acceptable if they are unified and taken to
kernel configuration level, so it would be easy to switch them in/out 
not only as boolean option but systematically for different levels,
subsystems and modules.
