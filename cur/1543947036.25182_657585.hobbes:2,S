Heh, yes, I've been reading this.
It sounds like an old version of a Novell product is making a newer
kernel spit out a warning message.  Odds are this is fixed in a newer
one, as well as the basic issue that Novell doesn't even ship anything
based on the 2.6.24 kernel yet, so perhaps the Zenworks developers don't
even know of the issue, that's what bugzilla.novell.com is for :)
