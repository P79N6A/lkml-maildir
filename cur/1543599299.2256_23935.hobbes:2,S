Here's a patch that allows you to compile the kernel with APIC enabled
always. Some machines need it, but others barf, when they find out that
there is an MP table and an IOAPIC but no APIC on the CPU is found.
(Plug a K6 in a dual Pentium board, e.g.)
Then you may pass the disableapic boot parameter, so you bypass APIC setup
completely and the APIC compiled kernel works like compiled without.
(For people who compile their own kernels, this is irrelevant, except for
 testing. That's not the majority of Linux users anymore, though.)
Another possibility might be to make apic.c:221 fail gracefully instead of
BUG(), BTW.
Linus, Alan, please apply to your trees!
In theory, the compile time option could be removed now, but some people
probably want to be able to save a few bytes.
Regards,
