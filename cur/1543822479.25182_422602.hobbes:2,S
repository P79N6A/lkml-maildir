Subject: [PATCH 00/14] Permit filesystem local caching and NFS superblock sharing  [try #8]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/10/167

These patches make it possible to share NFS superblocks between related
mounts, where "related" means on the same server and FSID. Inodes and dentries
will be shared where the NFS filehandles are the same (for example if two NFS3
files come from the same export but from different mounts, such as is not
uncommon with autofs on /home).
These patches also add local caching for network filesystems such as NFS and
AFS.
The first six patches (NFS superblock sharing) can be applied without the
remaining patches (filesystem local caching).
