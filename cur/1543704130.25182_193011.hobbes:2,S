Well, I've just checked rivafb under 2.6.1 and I didn't notice this mistake - 
there are good colours in Midnight Commander. Probably this bug was repaired 
somewhere in 2.5.
But I have no idea which options should I send to kernel to get different 
resolution (video=riva:800x600-16@85 don't work) and I have very ugly Linux 
logo while booting ;)
