The following problem occured on an Athlon64 X2 under 2.6.20-rc4-mm1,
but not 2.6.20-rc3-mm1.
I'm using two D-Link DUB-E100 USB ethernet adapters, using the 'asix'
driver. When I upgraded to 2.6.20-rc4-mm1, they were still recognized,
but various ifconfig operations on them (up/down, changing IP) caused
a system freeze (including caps lock/num lock lights) for many seconds.
I do not believe there was anything new in dmesg when the system
resumed. USB debugging was not turned on at the time, though the
problem is repeatable.
Also, no packets actually made it out of the adapters (watching from
other systems on the network).
Since this is a system we need running and networked, I can't do
extensive testing on it, but I might be to bring it down for a few
quick tests if that would help.
