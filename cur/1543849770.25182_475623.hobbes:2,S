But I don't have to upgrade all my software to 64 bit [but 32-bit 
emulation solves that].
Still, an upgrade to the next 32-bit kernel could be seen as less 
threatening.

One of my motivations was to get testers who run 32-bit for historical 
or flash plugin reasons.
If there is a consensus that it should be dropped, though, I'll drop 
it.  I certainly didn't have any fun getting it to run.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
