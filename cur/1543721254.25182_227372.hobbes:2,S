Hello
I am having hp omnibook xe4500 which has an integrated keyboard and I am
having also external USB mouse. There is an internal mouse inside.
What should I tick up in 2.4.25 in "Input core" and "USB HID" so that
1) keyboard works upon bootup
2) USB mouse works
I have determined these things are dependent on almost everything in the
kernel configuration, for example CONFIG_AGP and CONFIG_DRM.
