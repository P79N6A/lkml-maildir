We don't necessarily need to keep the ASCII strings around at all, and in 
the case in which CONFIG_PCI_NAMES=n, they are completely irrelevant. They 
are pretty, but we could just export the vendor/device IDs and have a 
userspace tool (e.g. sysutils from IBM) look up the name in a userspace 
database.
