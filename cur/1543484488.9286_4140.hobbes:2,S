Hi all,
My employer is in the process of setting up an SMP kernel (2.2.1) on a
Network Engines P6000 dual processor (450Mhz PII) machine. It's a
multi-blade machine. (5)
We're having a problem where the kernel recognizes the first processor, but
refuses to recognize the second. Does anyone here have any experience with
setting these up? Could anyone possibly point us in the right direction?
Please cc: any replies to my email address as well. I suspect this may be a
timing issue, but a bit of input from someone who's used and set these up
before would be REALLY helpful. Thanks in advance...
Eric
