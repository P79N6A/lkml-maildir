In protected mode, the kernel stack. And, regardless of implimentation
details, there can only be one. It's the one whos stack-selector
is being used by the CPU. So, in the case of Linux, with multiple
kernel stacks (!?????), one for each process, whatever process is
running in kernel mode (current) has it's SS active. It's the
one that gets hit with the interrupt.
