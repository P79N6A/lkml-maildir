At the moment kbuild 2.5 ranges from 10% faster on small builds to 100%
slower on a full kernel build.  But that is using slow core code which
I know I can rewrite to make it significantly faster.
>b) what's the eta on 2.5?
kbuild 2.5 is ready now.  I am not even going to start on the core
rewrite until Linus takes the existing kbuild 2.5 code.  The existing
code works and is stable, doing a complete core rewrite just before
includeing in the kernel strikes me as stupid.
