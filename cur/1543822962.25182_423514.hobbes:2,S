No, this is a bug (hardware probably as I cannot find anything in the
specs that can even be remotely related). The chances of getting any
help from the manufacturer are slim at best. I've already contacted all
the major ones and requested erratas, but so far not a single reply.

Not really, no. Since I assume this controller works fine in Windows,
I'm guessing it needs a very particular init sequence. It might have
something to do with the ios calls that are made when the slot is empty.
If you have the time, you could try adding some code that will make the
driver ignore ios calls until a card is inserted.
