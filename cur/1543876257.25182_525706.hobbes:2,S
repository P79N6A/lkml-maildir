You mean that a quoted report talks about 2.6.20-1.3025.fc7 kernel?
These are vagaries of kernel version numbering in Fedora.
Changelogs are not that clear but it appears that
2.6.19-1.2911.6.4.fc6 will be actually closer to 2.6.20.
That kernel from a bug report is really, for all intents and purposes,
2.6.21-rc5 (if I am not misreading something).
I am afraid that I do not have at this moment an easy to way to check
"plain" 2.6.20 on the hardware in question.  It appears that the
essential difference is that a working kernel is using and old IDE
driver, and sees the drive - in this case - as /dev/hdc, while the
current one tries to go through libata and chockes uncontrollably.
