The code I wrote and appended yesterday.  Though, as I realize now in my
post of a few minutes ago, there are perhaps 8 places where instead of
calling various bitmap_ops() unconditionally ('and', 'or', ...) it would
be better to peel off the one-word case and inline it.

Don't we have quite a few places with one, two, even three local variables
of type cpumask_t?  Which live on the stack?  For all mask implementations?
Grep around for "cpumask_t.*,.*," and many of the lines you see appear to
be declarations of such local cpumask_t variables.
And we need to be careful of converting pass by value semantics for small
cpumasks into pass by reference semantics for large cpumasks, as a hidden
feature of the implementation.  One could code some cute bugs that way.
Better, I think, to provide a reasonably rich set of mask ops, so that the
using code need not have anymore than the essential number of distinctly
different masks hanging around at once in order to write clear code.
