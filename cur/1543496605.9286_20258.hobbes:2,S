[Assumption: we are talking about United States law]
There are (at least) three things it appears your attorneys have overlooked.
(1) The major goal in such a suit would be to stop the infringement, not to
squeeze money out of the infringer.
(2) The copyright owner could elect statutory damages instead of actual
damages.
(3) Damages include the infringer's profits from the infringement.  If the
infringer is not giving the infringing code away for free, this could be
a substantial sum.
