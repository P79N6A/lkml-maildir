To get the data sent to disk in a reasonable amount of time - don't leave it
floating about in memory for hours or days.

Because delaying the writeback to permit combining is a good optimisation.
The alternative of not starting new writeout of a dirty page if that page
happens to be under writeout at the time is neither one nor the other. 
With that proposal, if the application really wants IO started right now,
then it's going to have to use msync(MS_SYNC).

That's what MS_ASYNC already does.  We're agreed that something needs to
change and we're just discussing what that is.  I'm proposing something
which is complete and flexible.
Another point here is that msync(MS_SYNC) starts writeout of _all_ dirty
pages in the file (as MS_ASYNC used to do) and it waits upon writeback of
the whole file.  That's quite inefficient for an app which has lots of
threads writing to and msync()ing the same MAP_SHARED file.
We could easily enough convert msync() to only operate on the affected
region of the (non-linearly-mapped) file.  But I don't think we can do that
now, because people might be relying upon the side-effects.
The fadvise() extensions allow us to fix this.  And we've needed them for
some time for regular write()s anyway.
