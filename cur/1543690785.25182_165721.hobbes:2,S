Mrs.Amina Bare Mainassara 
16, Rue of the gardens Cocody 
Abidjan Cote d'ivoire. 
Attn:Sir/Madam, 
I sincerely apologize for inconveniencing you with 
this mail even if we never met before, I firmly 
believe that a true confidence can be born from our 
communication and thus support a true partnership 
between us two. 
As it is with a real pleasure as I contact you from 
ABIDJAN the economic capital of Cote d'IVOIRE(AFRIQUE 
of the West) where I live for some time with my two 
children, Moussa and Samira. 
In fact I am Mrs Amina Bare Mainassara, the legitimate 
wife of the former president of the republic of NIGER 
(WEST AFRICA) assassinated by a young soldier in April 
1999. During the exercise of his presidential mandate, 
my husband had lodged a box with a security company in 
Europe containing the sum of Ten Million Umited States 
Dollars to allow him to conceive a project of 
investment at the end of his presidential mandate. 
Unfortunately fate decided differently. few months 
after his death, I discovered in the will, this 
information and I automatically made contacts with the 
security company to assert this important legacy in my 
position as the legitimate wife and in comparison with 
the testamentary stipulations. Now my major concern is 
to ensure that the money is invested properly. 
Considering my condition and that of my children, we 
have suffered seriously from the hands of my late 
husband's political adversaries. 
It is from this point of view that I contact you so 
that you can help me to withdraw this consignment from 
the security company Because I believe that you can 
help me in this transaction. 
I can thus reassure you that at the end of the 
operation I will authorize 20% of the total amount to 
you as your reward for your good effort. 
while another 5% of this amount will be set aside 
forany expenditure that may be incured during the 
course of this transaction. 
As soon as you express the desire to help us I will 
deliver you more details, find attached copies of my 
picture and that of my children. 
Receive my most sincere greetings. 
Waitng to hear your positive response and ensure you send me your 
telephone and fax numbers. 
Faithfully yours, 
Mrs Amina Bare Mainassara.
