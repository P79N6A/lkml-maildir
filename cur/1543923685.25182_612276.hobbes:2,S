OK, I forwarded these with some more checkpatch.pl fixes.
But as I commented elsewhere, please work harder to make sure
that your patch comments actually match the patches!!
And also, pay closer attention to when you may be making
changes that make device drivers work differently over
your spi_master controller driver than anyone elses ...
such platform-specific behaviors are undesirable, and when
they go against specified behavior they are also bugs.
