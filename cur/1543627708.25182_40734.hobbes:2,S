I think I tried the pentium stuff, but that would freeze up the computer 
too (the HD light comes on, and nothing else works, not even ping(!)) 
But I think that was for a <=2.4.14. I should try it again.
Here's the output of lspci:

New news, I got up this morning and the computer was frozen again. This 
time, I compiled in the kernel (not as modules) SCSI, SCSI CD, SCSI 
Disk, PPA, completely removed ide-scsi stuff, compiled in ide-cdrom. So 
I took ide-scsi out of the loop altogether.
