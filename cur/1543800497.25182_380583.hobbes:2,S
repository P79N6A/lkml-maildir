I did not read (and find) your original posting, but it appears to me
that your problem is similar to mine. I upgraded to 4GB RAM on X86_64
and after that my Intel Gigabit card stopped working.

Perhaps the higher class Gigabit cards need some memory area that is
(once) overwritten with 4GB main memory? I have no clue, actually :)

Did you try the ethtool tests? They show more information, at least with
my card.

Does the problem still occur with 2GB (less)? Did you try running
Knoppix? The latter solves the problem here, but obviously Knoppix is no
final solution.

Wow.
