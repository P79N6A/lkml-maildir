Sure. Those architectures don't need to drag down the rest.
Plenty of headers are only exported for some architectures.
(Well actually, such architectures could just give apps a
writable flag to disable the scheduler -- this is acceptable
for the embedded things these architectures are used for.
I've seen it done for user-space spinlocks. It works great.)
It's not as if the app developers would care to support
those architectures anyway. They don't even support all
the non-defective ones: I use the second or third most
popular architecture (ppc), and the app developers have
made it very clear that they don't give a damn. Something
else will get you: char being unsigned by default, wrong
endianness, stack growing the HP way, etc.
