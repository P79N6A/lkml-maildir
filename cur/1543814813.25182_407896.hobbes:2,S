Andrew,
Tom Rini pointed out a LTP test failure in the preempt-rt tree.
I verified against mainline and following fixups are needed.
The setitimer values from userspace are not validated. Non canonical
values were silently converted by the pre hrtimer code. 
This silent conversion also happened for the unsigned to signed 
conversion for sys_alarm.
This should go into 2.6.16
