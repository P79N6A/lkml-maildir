the grep faults in the pagecache, and depending on which job is active 
first, the placement of the pages will either be spread out or local, 
depending on the timing of those jobs. How do you expect this to behave 
deterministically?

nondeterministic placement of pagecache pages sure looks nasty. In most 
cases i suspect what matters are project-specific data files - which 
will be allocated deterministically because they are mostly private to 
the cpuset. But e.g. /usr files want to be local in most cases, even for 
a 'spread out' cpuset. Why would you want to allocate them globally?

but a single object cannot be allocated both locally and globally!  
(well, it could be, for read-mostly workloads, but lets ignore that 
possibility) So instead of letting chance determine it, it is the most 
natural thing to let the object (or its container) determine which 
strategy to use - not the workload. This avoids the ambiguity at its 
core.
so if two projects want to use the same file in two different ways at 
the same time then there is no solution either under the VFS-based or 
under the cpuset-based approach - but at least the VFS-based method is 
fully predictable, and wont depend on which science department starts 
its simulation job first ...
if two projects want to use the same file in two different ways but not 
at the same time, then again the VFS-based method is better: each 
project, when it starts to run, could/should set the policy of that 
shared data. (which setting of policy would also flush all pagecache 
pages of the affected file[s], flushing any prior incorrect placement of 
pages)
