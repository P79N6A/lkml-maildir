As a side note, I believe that this is the upstream code and does not include
the latest multicast changes.
I'm not sure if anything calls into the sa_query interfaces from interrupt
context, but I doubt it.  From my brief look at the initially reported issue, I
can't determine if there's an actual problem without studying the ipoib code
more.
