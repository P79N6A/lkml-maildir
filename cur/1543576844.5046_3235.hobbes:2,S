  Checking test11 (which I'm running here), even with waitq debugging
turned off, on 32-bit (IA32) the struct page is 68bytes (since
the "age" member was re-introduced a while back).
  For my development testing, I'm running a _heavily_ hacked kernel.  One
of these hacks is to pull the wait_queue_head out of struct page; the
waitq-heads are in a separate allocated area of memory, with a waitq-head
pointer embedded in the page structure (allocated/initialised in
free_area_init_core()).  This gives a page structure of 60bytes, giving me
one free double-word to play with (which I'm using as a pointer to a
release function).
  Infact, there doesn't need to be a waitq-head allocated for each page
structure - they can share; with a performance overhead on a false
wakeup in __wait_on_page().
  Note, for those of us running on 32bit with lots of physical memory, the
available virtual address-space is of major consideration.  Reducing the
size of the page structure is more than just reducing cache misses - it
gives us more virtual to play with...
