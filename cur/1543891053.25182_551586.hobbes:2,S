Good question. To be precise, I think the problem doesn't exist here but
after the exit_mm() because there's a VMA that holds a reference to the
same file.
The existing code appears to solve the race between
reading/following /proc/tsk->pid/exe and exit_mm() in the exit path by
returning -ENOENT for the case where there is no executable VMA with a
reference to the file backing it.
So I need to put NULL in the exe_file field and adjust the return value
to be -ENOENT instead of -ENOSYS.
Thanks for the review!
Cheers,
