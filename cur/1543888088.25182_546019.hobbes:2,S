Of course it is likely to be in the same cacheline, however if your L1
cache latency or throughput simply isn't up to it, FLATMEM systems
definitely could just not use ->virtual, but still add the extra padding
in the struct page for performance reasons... then they get to use
power-of-2 arithmetic to boot.
The page->virtual thing is just a bonus (although have you seen what
sort of hoops SPARSEMEM has to go through to find page_address?! It
will definitely be a win on those architectures).

0.2% of memory, or 2MB per GB. But considering we already use 14MB per
GB for the page structures, it isn't like I'm introducing an order of
magnitude problem.
The real benefit I see comes from cache footprint reduction of operations
on struct page. Consider with a 64 byte cacheline and 56 byte struct page,
then every 8 struct pages, 6 span 2 cachelines (75%). If you consider an
operation like reclaim that uses first and last fields, and assume that
pages are going to end up being random, then you're going to touch 75%
more cachelines.  Ditto for allocating and freeing pages.
