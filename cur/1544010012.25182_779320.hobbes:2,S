If it is your intention to submit this for a mainline merge then I
would encourage you to stop feature work at the earliest reasonable
stage and then move into the document, submit, review, merge, fixfixfix
phase.  That might take as long as several months.
Once things have stabilised and it's usable and performs respectably,
start thinking about features again.
Do NOT fall into the trap of adding more and more and more stuff to an
out-of-tree project.  It just makes it harder and harder to get it
merged.  There are many examples of this.
Also, don't feel that a merge would lock you into the current on-disk
layout.  I think it would be acceptable to emit a big printk("the
format of this fs will change without notice.  Do not yet store any
data on a tux3 fs") during mount().   For a while.
