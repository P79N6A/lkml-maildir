ah - nice :-)
/me checks the linux-sparse archive
Al's patch is:
+                       if (op == '&' && expr->left->type == EXPR_PREOP &&
+                           expr->left->op == '!')
+                               warning(expr->pos, "dubious: !x & y");
i think there might be similar patterns: "x & !y", "!x | y", "x | !y" ?
