Yeah, it's not pretty. I also hope this division to be very
transitional, that's why I didn't bother to do anything nicer.

Struct names ? I'd rather not duplicate everything. Or did you mean
initialization function names, e.g. INIT_RAW_PRIO_TREE_ROOT ?
Or, for just the flag, maybe something like
#define PRIO_TREE_RAW		1
#define PRIO_TREE_NORMAL	0
?
