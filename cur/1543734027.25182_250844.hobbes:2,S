Yuck. I don't like things like this to depend on NR_CPUS, because your
kernel may behave quite differently depending on the value. But in this
case I guess "quite differently" is probably "a little bit differently",
and practical reality may dictate that you need to do something like
this at compile time, and NR_CPUS is your best approximation.
That said, I *don't* think this should go in hastily.
First reason is that the lru lock is per zone, so the premise that
zone->lru_lock aquisitions increases O(cpus) is wrong for anything large
enough to care (ie. it will be NUMA). It is possible that a 512 CPU Altix
will see less lru_lock contention than an 8-way Intel box.
Secondly is that you'll might really start putting pressure on small L1
caches (eg. Itanium 2) if you bite off too much in one go. If you blow
it, you'll have to pull all the pages into cache again as you process
the pagevec.
I don't think the smallish loop overhead constant (mainly pulling a lock
and a couple of hot cachelines off another CPU) would gain much from
increasing these a lot, either. The overhead should already at least an
order of magnitude smaller than the actual work cost.
Lock contention isn't a good argument either, because it shouldn't
significantly change as you tradeoff hold vs frequency if we assume
that the lock transfer and other overheads aren't significant (which
should be a safe assumption at PAGEVEC_SIZE of >= 16, I think).
Probably a PAGEVEC_SIZE of 4 on UP would be an interesting test, because
your loop overheads get a bit smaller.
