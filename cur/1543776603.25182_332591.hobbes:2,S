hello,
i have two disjunct networks with only one computer connected to both
of them. I did the following setup:
eth0: 192.168.111.13/24
eth1: 158.195.100.248/22
later i added eth0:0 158.195.101.13/22
i did ssh user@158.195.101.13 from the eth1's network, but notice the
eth0:0's address.
ip_forward was 0, rp_filter was 1.
i suppose this behaviour is incorrect. is it ?
