I thought you might find this helpful.  (I brought this issue up with
the Slackware folks once, and they told me basically this.)

:Security:Forkbomb
I was also told that the ability to spawn such rampant forks/processes
is controlled by default in Debian.  Is this the case?
Here is an LQ thread where I brought it up:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-security-4/how-can-i-prevent-forkbombs-338560/
I would like to see something done about this, with Ubuntu as popular as
it is, even as a server in some cases.  Is there a way that in the
future, one could simply download a package or click a box or something
and have a limit set, like the links suggest?  That would make things
just "that much" more convenient for system administrators (and might
help them/us to remember to set these limits, too...).
Thanks.
