Hello all,
    I noticed the discussion about linux kernel modules that happened 
last week. I was wondering about something with regards to the linux 
kernel and Section 2c of the GPL. Why doesn't the kernel on booting 
print something about the kernel being free software licensed under the 
GPL, and shouldn't it?
please CC responses to hamilton@sedsystems.ca
