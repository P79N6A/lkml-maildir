Hello, kernel-ites:
	I mentioned this in an earlier message titled "kernel blocks too
long with SO_LINGER", and since that time I did some investigation, and
have come to the conclusion that there is an error in the 2.2 kernel.
In particular, this code is just broken:
===============================
linux-2.2.13/net/ipv4/af_inet.c:485
	timeout = 0;
	if (sk->linger && !(current->flags & PF_EXITING)) {
		timeout = HZ * sk->lingertime;
		if (!timeout)
			timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
	}
	sock->sk = NULL;
	sk->socket = NULL;
	sk->prot->close(sk, timeout);
===============================
Unless anyone has a compelling reason for this behavior, I'd like to
propose the following patch.  I hope that Alan and Dave can agree to put
this into the next 2.2 release:

 			timeout = HZ * sk->lingertime;
-			if (!timeout)

 				timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;

===============================================
Personally, I would probably just remove the conditional and assignment
altogether, and not give any way to get MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT, but since
negative values are undefined anyways it basically only costs the 
conditional to allow that behavior.
