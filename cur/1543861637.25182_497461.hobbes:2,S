Most memorable issues:
* "don<decimal-180>t" (standalone accent aigu) rather than "don't" (apostrophe)
* "<decimal-160>", non breaking spaces
* cp437 encoding in some files (heh, heh, DOS!)
* iso8859-1/utf-8 mixed in some files
My compose key is hot now...
None of you people screw that patch with your buggy MUAs! I'll pack
it up into a .bz2 to get it marked as application/octet-stream to
not even give your MUA the chance to. ;-) [and because it's 221 K 
uncompressed and I am not sure if splitting it up makes much sense for 
such 'trivial' changes, or not?]
