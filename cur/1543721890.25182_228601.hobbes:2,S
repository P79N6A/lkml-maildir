Maybe. And even that's a sad thing. Work has been done, and (without
knowing the exact state of the fb development) I'm sure James did a good
job on them. Caring for patches (so they make their way upstream) can
take as long as doing the programming. If this work could be layed off,
that would be nice:)
So we need Rusty's "Not-so-trivial patch monkey(s)"...
