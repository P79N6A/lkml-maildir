Where is this list of SMI functions?  I looked through your library
documentation and it wasn't clear.  Is this it?

Not really.  You've just created a little interface so you can diddle
hardware directly from userspace.  That's about as far from a proper
abstraction as you can get.
There appears to be no validation of any of the data that your library
attempts to poke into the hardware.  Is it possible to crash or
irrepairably confuse the hardware from userspace using this interface?
If so, you're circumventing one of the basic functions of the
kernel/application separation.

Being that Linux isn't a microkernel, that's not the way we go about
things.  If we were trying to move as much as possible to userspace,
every USB driver would be implemented as a library talking to usbfs, and
ACPI tables would be interpreted by a little app run at boot.
Your interface between userspace and the kernel needs to expose to
userspace only the functionality it provides while hiding the details of
actually twiddling the hardware.  Preferably, the sysfs files you need
can be structured so that the same type of management interface can be
implemented by other vendors and it will look roughly the same to
userspace.  (Creating standard interfaces to similar but different
hardware is what sysfs is all about.)

Actually, that's what the new hwmon class is for.  Your kernel driver
should provide access to the (raw) fan status values through hwmon
files, and the lm_sensors library will read it from there just like
every other fan sensor device.
If the hwmon class doesn't provide the functionality you need for this,
bring it up for discussion here, rather than going off and inventing
your own proprietary interface.

Adding 60 more files isn't going to horribly bloat sysfs, and your
implementation cost is probably lower than adding functions to your
library.

That's kind of the point of sysfs--exposing system and hardware knobs
and gauges in a safe manner.  Again, if you're not able to validate what
userspace gives you before stuffing it into the hardware, you need to
rethink your interface.

How is this different from requiring everyone to download a new version
of your library?

I suspect that saying, "I don't have time to do this properly so please
merge this anyway" is not a very good way to get your patch accepted.

Maybe this could be helped by working more closely with vendors to get
your changes integrated into their kernel packages?

That's why we have modules.  Red Hat and SuSE ship support for a lot
more network cards, for example, than most people own, but that doesn't
mean they're all compiled into the kernel all the time.
I really like what you're trying to do here, but please rethink your
kernel API.  It makes much more sense to have a standard interface for
providing system management functions than for each vendor to create
their own proprietary libraries.  -Nathan
