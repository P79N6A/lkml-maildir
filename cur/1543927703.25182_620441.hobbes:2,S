Hi,
I like this concept in general; I have one minor comment; right now
your namespace argument is like
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(foo, some_symbol);
from a language-like pov I kinda wonder if it's nicer to do
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS("foo", some_symbol);
because foo isn't something in C scope, but more a string-like
identifier...
