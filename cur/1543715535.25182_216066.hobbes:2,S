Well, since he only seems to have one patch available at any given time,
this doesn't seem like that big a deal to me, personally..  I was,
however, thinking of suggesting that it might be easier to keep track of
things if there were some sort of version numbers or datestamps or
something in the filename so somebody can tell that this "neofb.diff.gz"
is actually a different patch from the "neofb.diff.gz" that was in exactly
the same place yesterday..
