Hi,
I apologize whether this question has been asked already, however I
performed a check on the archives and didn't find anything suitable to
my case.
I would like some enlightenment about dev_queue_xmit use:
The man page explains that the buffer is being 'consumed', however I
can increase the reference count value in order to attempt a resend.
Does this mean that I should proceed this way (see code below) in case
I am willing to send the same skb more than once (ie, multiple times)?
***********************************************************************
...
...
while(i want to send this skb)
{
       skb_get(skb)
       skb->dev = output_device;
       skb->packet_type = PACKET_OUTGOING;
        xmit_rvalue = dev_queue_xmit(skb)
        if(xmit_rvalue) /* != 0 not successful send */
                goto error;
}
       return (0);
error:
     dev_kfree_skb(skb);
     return (-1);
***********************************************************************
So, is it okay or this piece of code and technique should be used only
in case of skb transmission error?
In short, what I would like to obtain is avoiding a (p)skb_copy
overhead before the dev_queue_xmit call.
Thank you in advance :)
