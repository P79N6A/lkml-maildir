OK, one problem is most likely something I added a month or so ago: a
new process is now assumed to be not a good anticipate candidate. This
solved some guy's obscure problem, but a lot of programs that benefit from
anticipation (ls, gcc, vi startup, cat, etc) are only going to submit a
few requests in their life, so they lose most of the gains. I have some
automatic thingy I'm testing at the moment.
The other problem could well be a big TCQ depth. AS helps with this, but
it can't do a really good job. Try a TCQ depth of max 4.
