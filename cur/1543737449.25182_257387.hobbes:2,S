I have an Itox G4C600 motherboard with on board Highpoint HPT366/370 ide
controller. I am trying to use the 4 available IDE channels separately
(i.e. not as raid). The hpt366 driver sees drives on the 1st channel but 
not on the 2nd. The Highpoint bios sees all drives.
I tried Highpoint's driver and it sees all drives work (although they 
used the scsi interface which is not good for me).
I had also tried a different board (same model) and this had the odd 
problem of seeing different combinations of the disks depending on how
the SATA was configured in the BIOS.
Kernel is 2.4.28-pre3. Ideas welcome. Thanks.
