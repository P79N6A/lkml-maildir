I'll defer to you since you know more about x86 than me, but I don't
see why it's necessary to do any of the setup.S sequence in real
mode.  Especially since the BSDs seem to manage it in protected mode
fine.  
With the possible exception of the video probe, I think we ought to be
able to query the hardware directly for the information we currently
get from the BIOS - and I think it would *reduce* the number of
problems if for example we never paid any attention to what it has to
say about hard drives.
