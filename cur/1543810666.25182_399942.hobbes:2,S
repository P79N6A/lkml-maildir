If it's all that fragile, surely it just means that someone picked the
wrong point at which to try to form the API abstraction?
Frankly, that seems to be the issue behind a lot of these problems -
people decide to shove stuff into userspace for some religions reason, 
without thinking about the API implications at all.
We don't have a sane way to package all the userspace crud together
with the microkernel that people are turning Linux into. Either people
quit pretending that divesting things to userspace is a solution to all
hard problems, or we create a packaging / bundling mechanism for all
this shite. Frankly, I prefer the former, but whichever ... it's
getting insane.
