Hmm.  Ok.
How do you propose to handle the following case:
Mobility Electronics supply a Cardbus to PCI bridged "docking station"
which has a PCI-PCI bridge on with vendor stuff above 0x40.  It appears
as a standard PCI-PCI bridge; the only specific identifying information
are the device and vendor IDs.  How can I guarantee that a driver I
write for this device will be picked up in preference to your driver.
(Given that your driver would probably be always loaded, and my driver
could well be a loadable module.)
I'm not saying that I will need to do this, but this is something which
needs to be carefully thought about if we're going to provide a generic
driver.
