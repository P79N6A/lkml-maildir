Yes, but by what criteria?  You want to log on a per host basis.
Someone else wants to log by service (www, ftp, mail, news), or
any number of other criteria.

If there really is a performance issue with a few hundred rules, then
it can be overcome by grouping rules in separate custom chains.  F.e.
if you have 1024 rules create 32 custom chains with 32 rules each.
Then have 32 rules in your main table which jump to the appropriate
custom chain --> maximum rules traversed by each packet = 64.
There is another issue with logging in general:
                *COUNTERS MUST NOT BE RESETABLE!!!*
Resetable counters guarantee that no two programs can co-exists if
they happen to reset the same counters.
All logging counters should be implemented with 32bit or 64bit
unsigned integers.  Any software using correct unsigned integer
arithmetic can then simply subtract a previous value from the current
value to get the difference.  This works reliably across counter
wrap-arounds.  There is absolutely *no need for reset* !
