I almost killed my USB 128mb flash (it's an mp3 player also).
I also noticed a strange partition and "fixed" it. And file transfers
where ok (VFAT, formatted), but suddenly it stopped playing audio. When I
redid the formatting as a plain DOS partition using fdisk command.
   o   create a new empty DOS partition table
MP3 started playing right.
It seems that many manufacturers rely on undocumented (yes, I haven't
found any pointers about partition table format, etc.) nuances
and settings.
Like your USB BAR's starting sector's data, that seemed to be garbage.
Maybe a message of caution should be displayed in usb-storage
configure help about attemtping to change partitions and/or filesystems on
USB storage devices.

Maciej
