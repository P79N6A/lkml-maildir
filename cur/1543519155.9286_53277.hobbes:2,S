Linus, change in fs/nfsd/vfs.c is bogus - it breaks mkdir() semantics over
NFS. mkdir("foo", 0x1777); should not strip the sticky bit. With the new
code it does. Please, revert it.
Question: will you object against switching /dev/loop over regular files 
to pagecache? Current variant uses bmap()+getblk() for IO and write() for
plugging the holes if backing file is sparse - definitely Bad Thing(tm).
