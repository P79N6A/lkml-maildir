Not entirely correct. If TiVO is making a change to the binary to include the 
signature, then it *could* be considered a derivative work. If the signature 
is stored in another place - say a bit of Flash or a separate file on the 
disc - then there is no way for it to be considered a derivative work. (Under 
US law, IIRC and I I've interpreted it (and the related cases) properly then 
the change would have to be to the source of the program for it to be 
considered a "derivative". But, as you say often and I should make clear 
myself, IANAL)

And this is relevant to a software license in which way? In particular how is 
this relevant to the GPL, which has always *only* guaranteed access to the 
source if you have access to the binary, the right to distribute your own 
versions and the right to modify the code.
Since the "right to run code" was never guaranteed it *cannot* be a violation. 
It might be in conflict with what RMS intended when he wrote the first 
version of the GPL and in conflict with the intent of the people that 
contributed to GPLv2 but that doesn't matter. However, I will not use (or 
recommend) the GPLv3 in its current form because I feel it makes unnecessary 
restrictions. The fact that you have to "allow additional rights" to make it 
equal to the GPLv2 makes a functional (and spiritual) difference to me.
(Why? Because I'm opposed to "In order to protect freedom X we have to 
restrict freedom Y. Its happening in the US *RIGHT* *NOW* and I have been 
doing what I can to fight that. Now the same faulty logic is being applied by 
the FSF with GPLv3)

Why isn't it in the US? Because the binary form of a program does not and 
cannot have a separate copyright than the source code. Since it is the 
*SOURCE* that is actually copyright (mechanical translation cannot create a 
new work, only a new form of an already copyrighted work) guaranteeing 
the "right to run" is pointless.
And you are wrong about that "Nobody thought of it" thing - what you mean is 
that "Nobody that had a hand in drafting and ratifying the GPLv2 thought of 
it". The "NSA Guidelines for Trusted Systems" (aka "The Orange Book") talks 
about methods of preventing the execution of code.
What you and the rest of the FSF is doing in response to "tivoization" is 
saying "we don't care if it wasn't designed to do X, we want to be able to 
make it do that anyway *AND* the manufacturer has to help us do it". There is 
no legal way for you to make that demand of a hardware manufacturer. Instead 
you've gone with the only legal recourse - saying "If you want to use my 
copyrighted work under license X, you have to do Y".  I have no problem with 
that, and if the FSF wants that, it's fine by me. But, as I said, I could 
care less where and/or if something I release under the GPL is used. This 
makes the GPLv2 perfect for me.

Yes, it is. But your argument about the TiVO is "they can modify the copy on 
it but I can't". Hence it is your main argument. And remember, replace != 
modify.

No. He was making a distinction that I have seen made a number of times. That 
is, a copy of a copyright work in a computers RAM is a *distinct* copy, 
separate from the file on disc it started as. (And that has actually been 
argued in a court case. I don't recall the specifics, but I do recall that 
the argument was held as valid)
