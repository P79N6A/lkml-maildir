Don't forget that embedded devices boot much more often than their desktop 
counterparts, and they are most often used by people who definitely fall into 
the non-linux savvy demographic (like my grandmother).
We use the Linux Progress Patch (
http://lpp.FreeLords.org/
) for our 
solutions.  Despite the size that it adds to the kernel (a 240 x 320 image is 
a pretty big linux_logo.h file), I feel that it makes the kernel booting 
procedure more painless for the average user (and the hackers can always use 
dmesg to find out what happened).
