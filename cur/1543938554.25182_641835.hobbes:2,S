Currently I don't have a SMTP server configured. As soon as my system is 
trustworthy, again, I'll do that.

... that may be possible...
I have all PCI slots filled with cards, two big IDE hard drives and one 
DVD RAM writer. I already disconnected the DVD drive, as this was nearly 
unusable with all those IDE errors. The power supply is (AFAIR) a 200 
watt one.
But may the power supply cause corrupted data? Shouldn't that crash down 
the PC completely?
