This was included into 2.4.17, I think, so this is not exactly new feature.
On the real new features list we have:
 - Relocated/nonstandard size journal support (actually was included in 2.4.22-pre3, too)
 - Support for writes larger than 4k in size (get speedup on large file writes, esp. in append mode,
                                              should be more SMP friendly, too)
 - Variable blocksize support (i.e. you can choose any blocksize in range of 1024 .. PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, must be power of 2)
Bye,
    Oleg
