The driver that ships with 2.4.19 isn't the most recent, though I doubt
there's anything in the up-to-date driver that should make a difference.
You can download the newest driver from www.3ware.com - just drop its
3w-xxxx.[ch] over the ones in your kernel source tree, recompile,
install, and reboot.
The error message you report is replicated in several spots within the
driver, so it's not useful in itself.
