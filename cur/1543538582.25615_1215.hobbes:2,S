for all who are interested...
the problem with the amd duron was the cooling fan.
in fact there is NO fan for the duron cpu so i had to use a socket 7
fan. i thought that should be ok but the duron has a different design
(outside) and gets overheated->solution cooling paste until a original
fan is available :)
