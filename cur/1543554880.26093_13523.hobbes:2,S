No, it wasn't a bug!  It was a demonstration.  The above code is
executed not by the application but by the *attacker* who has managed
to 0wn the existing jail.
Doing the additional chroot("foo") without already being in "foo"
basically replaces the chroot jail you *were* in, so you are now out.
The sequence I posted is just the simplest un-chroot procedure I know,
to explain why chroot cannot sandbox the superuser.
