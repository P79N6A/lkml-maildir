Hi!
I have problems in getting my soundcard SB128PCI running under
a 2.2.7 Kernel (SuSE 6.1 system). I have made a kernel with
support for my soundcard (Ensoniq AudioPCI (rev. 01) with an
ES1370, I suppose). I can activate the "sound" module:
>modprobe sound
>lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
sound                  59000   0 
soundlow                 304   0  [sound]
soundcore               2788   3  [sound]
But I cannot activate the "sb" module:
>modprobe sb
/lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/sb.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
/lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/sb.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/sb.o failed
/lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/sb.o: insmod sb failed
The message file gives another hint:
May  7 16:34:00 rzpc kernel: Soundblaster audio driver ...
May  7 16:34:00 rzpc kernel: sb: dsp reset failed.
I guess (hope) it's just a problem of proper setting
the "I/O, IRQ, and DMA" parameters for the module. But
how do I find them? I don't have a windows system
installed and really wouldn't like to install one
just to find the parameters! The default setting
for a SB in /etc/conf.modules is:
options sb io=0x220 irq=7 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330
This apparently does not work. During bootup I see
irq being 11 for the soundcard. Is this, what I have
to enter here? What about the remaining parameters?
Thanks,
Ruben
PS. I have checked /proc/interrupts, /proc/ioports
    and /proc/dma but cannot find my soundcard
    there. Also pnpdump does not find anything use-
    full since the soundcard is PCI based.
