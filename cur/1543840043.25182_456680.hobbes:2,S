Yes, but it can't move pre-empted threads out of a particularly 
dangerous EIP (like a piece of code we're about to patch over).  Or 
perhaps I am misunderstanding how it deals with preemption, and what it 
really does is make sure all threads are in userspace or sleep state...  
which in that case is perfectly fine.

But with paravirt-ops, that global state may include local CPU state, in 
which paravirt-ops is intimately involved.  So they could interrupt in 
the middle of the patching code, then attempt a paravirt_ops call, which 
is in an undefined state until the patching is complete.  And I would 
highly expect the debugger to  mess with debug registers, which is a 
paravirt op.  NMIs can do plenty of dangerous things to local state as 
well - reading and writing MSRs or performance counters I would imagine 
to be quite useful.
