Your comments are highly relevant! Almost everything said in this
thread, apart from "where should we put battery readouts", is
applicable to hwmon.
The problem we're trying to solve is minimizing system load and timer
interrupts caused by apps that track kernel-issued readouts (e.g.,
hwmon's), without the application making unnecessary assumptions about
the driver or vice versa.

The equivlent phrasing using "and" is s follows:
"as soon as the current time is at least T+min_wait *and* you have a
readout that was received from the hardware at  time at least
T+min_fresh."

Here's an example illustrating all parameters.
Suppose the app does a DELAYED_UPDATE with min_wait=700 and
min_fresh=1000 at time T, and then poll()s with a timeout of 9999.
At time T+600 the driver receives update events (yeah, it' that kind
of driver). If this is all that happens, the app will remain blocked
for 9999ms -- the requirement for a readout fresher than T+700 is
never fulfilled.
If the driver get a second event at time T+800, the app will be
unblocked at time T+1000. If, instead, the driver gets the second
event at time T+1200, the app will be unblocked immediately.

Yes. All those should be told to use O_NONBLOCK, or be delayed by one
readout cycle whenever they poll an attribute. How serious is this?
The essential problem is that we don't want drivers to query the
hardware and cause timer interrups when nobody's listening, so cached
values can get arbitrarily stale. Thus, an out-of-the-blue read by a
*must* wait for a refresh (i.e., hardware query). I don't see a
non-kludgy way out of it.

Yes, but the driver doesn't know how frequently apps *need* it to read
from the chip.
Take the hdaps driver, for example. The hardware can provide fresh
readouts at a rate of 500Hz. Some apps (e.g., hdapsd) actually need a
high poll rate. Others (e.g., joystick emulation and hdaps-gl) work
nicely with 20Hz. And the tp-theft app will be useful even with 1Hz,
and may change its poll rate depending on circumstances. So, what is
the driver supposed to do?
In my proposal, the the driver and all app (implicitly) negotiate a
poll rate which makes sense for all parties involved.

Yes, this may not be relevant for traditional hwmon chips, but we're
trying to handle event-based data sources too. You might get an ACPI
event on temperature change, or a "critical temperature" interrupt
(which flips a boolean sysfs attr) , etc. I can't think of a really
convincing example, but we certainly want an interface that will
support such drivers transparently to userspace.

Only on average. If you use min_wait=1000 and min_fresh=0, you might
be seeing cached readouts that were obtained at times
999,1001,2999,3001,4999,5001,...
which is probably not what you want.

Yes, for sysfs there's a seek(fd, ..., 0). There isn't one if you use
the input infrastructure's approach, where read()s return a stream of
event records.
