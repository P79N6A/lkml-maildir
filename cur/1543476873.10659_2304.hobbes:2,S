Hi again,
Here is a patch for NFS over TCP (which fixes write and reconnect
problems) it is against 2.2.0-pre6.
it contains the previous write only fix and the credits patch I sent out
earlier,
the write bug was a problem with a callback handler setting another
callback handler,
and the disconnect problem I fixed by moving a check out of xprt_recvmsg
and allowing it to return 0 indication an empty packet (which works for me
but may not be exactly the right thing .. it seems to be the right thing
however .. )
So NFS over TCP should be fixed now...
one for the Irish :-) (who said all we did was drink ?)
Dave.
