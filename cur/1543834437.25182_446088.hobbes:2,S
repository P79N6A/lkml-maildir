Dearest Beloved one,
I write to intimate you of a matter that requires an urgent 
attention. But briefly, I am Morin Mado, i am 20yrs old the 
Daughter of late Dr John D Mado he was thechairman/CEO of the 
SIERERRA LEONE.national Gold & Diamond Mining Corporation. 
It is my pleasure communicating with you for the first time and 
believing that it will lead to a better relationship between us. I 
also hope you will not impede this trust and confidence I repose 
in you. 
I am sending this letter from Senegal where I have an official 
refugee status with my younger Brother Adama After leaving our 
country due to an event that took place on Febuary 2004 which led 
to the arrest and detention of my father and six other men after a 
faceoff with the SIERERRA LEONE government on allegation of subversive 
activities and treasonable offences which was nothing but a mere 
political persecution. 
After fivemonths in the military detention camp my father was 
announced dead by the government special press release. Though I 
do not know to what extent you are familiar with the event and 
crisis in SIERERRA LEONE, however during the disturbance and prior to my 
father's death he gave me all the documents for the secret loged 
he made in a fidiciary company in ERUOPE. he loged in ?10.2 
Million dollar, as personal effect . 
However I have gone to the bank to confirm the deposit and 
establish ownership, please I need your assistance urgently in 
moving this fund abroad for investment,when the fund is properly 
secured we will jointly invest in any business you consider 
profitable. 
I will be glad for your resolved assistance, I will kindly 
appreciate if we can talk and emerge words with action. With all 
honesty to the stated data in my message,i assure you of the 
genuity of this proposal. 
I will particularly be happy if you can handle this transactionin 
the most confidential manner since the rest of my life solely 
depends on this fund. 
It is the fear of betrayal from anyone around us here that 
confirms my decision to contact a neutral individual like you, and 
I want you to educate me on investment potential in your country 
since I would not like to invest or stay in any of the African 
country,except otherwise. 
I will not hesitate to give you 25% or negotiable of the total sum 
for your assistance. So if you will be able to assist me, please 
do urgently reply me for further clarification and confirmation . 
Thank for your anticipated co-operation, May God bless you. pls contact me and my brother here;(morinmado3@myway.com <
