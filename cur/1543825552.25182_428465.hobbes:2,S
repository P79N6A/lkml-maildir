To put this in perspective all of those numbers are drawing screens
way faster than your monitor refresh rate so the text isn't visible.
Highest speed where you could actually see the data, assuming that you
can read at 70 FPS...
3229 lines / 25 lines per screen / 70Hz refresh = 1.85s
3229 lines / 50 lines per screen / 70Hz refresh = 0.92s
But faster code in fbdev is good since it lowers the overall CPU load.
I would like to see fbdev acceleration unified with the other drivers
(DRM/X) so that a single state is maintained in the hardware.
