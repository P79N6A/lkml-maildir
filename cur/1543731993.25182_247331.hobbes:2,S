Thanks.
The #include <asm/io.h> comes from bk-ia64.patch time
interpolation logic patch from Cristoph Lameter.
I've checked that at least for the embedded port I'm
working on the linux/mm.h is *not* a must on ppc
asm/io.h so we can get rid of it (commented out).
Maybe this is also true for the rest of ppc platforms.
Now 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 builds fine.
Cheers,
Albert
