extern struct address_space swapper_space;
static inline struct address_space *page_mapping(struct page *page)
{
        struct address_space *mapping = NULL;
 
        if (unlikely(PageSwapCache(page)))
                mapping = &swapper_space;
        else if (likely(!PageAnon(page)))
                mapping = page->mapping;
        return mapping;
}
I'll leave that for someone else to sort out.
