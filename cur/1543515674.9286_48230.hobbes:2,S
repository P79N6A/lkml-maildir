That would be nice.  However, there is a workaround.  You change fork (or 
vfork) to a clone which starts off on a trampoline, which stops itself and 
allows strace to get the pid and ptrace it.
I had to do this for the user-mode port.  If anyone wants the code, let me 
know, and I'll send it over.
