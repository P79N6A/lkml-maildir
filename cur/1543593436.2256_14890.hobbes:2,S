If that were the only thing missing... At least I was able to catch it by 
simply being tidy -- I was going over the control bits to see which of 
them need to be/make sense to be set. 
But what about setting the hash (the imperfect filter)? The 21143 docs say
the *upper* 9 bits of the crc32 should be used; the Xircom docs are
completely silent, and the driver currently uses the *lower* 9 bits of the
crc32.
Oh, and for that matter, the hash is currently broken on the Xircom: 
unlike the 21143, the Xircom has 4 perfect filter slots in hash mode, not
one, but the driver ignores this fact. The hash layout is also severely
brain-damaged... I'll look into fixing it tomorrow -- by simply copying 
the fix from the patch I wrote for the other xircom driver (xircom_cb). :-)
Thanks,
Ion
