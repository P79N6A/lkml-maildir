Subject: [PATCH] getname() buffer overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The pathname slab cache size was "reduced" from PAGE_SIZE to
PATH_MAX + 1 during the 2.4.0-test series, and len similarly
adjusted in do_getname().  But its "are we near top of task space?"
test should have been adjusted too: could overflow if page size >4KB.
Patch below against 2.4.2-ac9, applies equally to 2.4.[012].
