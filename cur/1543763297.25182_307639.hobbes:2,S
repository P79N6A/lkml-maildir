It seems logical to be there, but in practicality, it's not. 
The problem is that the flags represent a state of the task with respect
to a single lock.  When the task loses ownership of a lock, the state of
the task changes. But the the lock has a different state at that moment
(it has a new onwner).  Now when it releases the lock, it might give the
lock to another task, and that becomes the pending owner. Now the state
of the lock is the same as in the beginning. But the first task needs to
see this change.
You can still pull this off by testing the state of the lock and compare
it to the current owner, but I too like the fact that you don't increase
the size of the kernel statically.  There are a lot more locks in the
kernel than tasks on most systems. And those systems that will have more
tasks than locks, need a lot of memory anyway.  So we only punish the
big systems (that expect to be punished) and keep the little guys safe.
