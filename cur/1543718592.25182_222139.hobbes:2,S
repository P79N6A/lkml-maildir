The PCI specs explicitly allow the cards to use a single address decoder for
both the ROM address and one of the BARs and there really are cards which make
use of this silliness.
Probably the only reasonable way how to do that reliably is to make a copy of
the ROM before the device is enabled.
OTOH, it might be sensible to add a sysfs-based interface for reading the ROMs
which would be available only to root and which would work only on cards
without the shared decoders :-)
				Have a nice fortnight
