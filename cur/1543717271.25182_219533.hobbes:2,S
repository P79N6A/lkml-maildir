Subject: [PATCH] efivars: check enabled {2.6.6 doesn't boot with 4k stacks}
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

| Perhaps I missed some readme, but just in case. One of my computer, P4HT[*]
| dies during booting. There is no log because nothing is still mounted, 
| but I took a photograph of the stack dump in the screen.

Yes, easy to reproduce...
| The .config file:

| I unchecked the 4K stack option and it's working nice.
drivers/firmware/efivars.c::efivars_init & efivars_exit
need to check for efi_enabled before doing anything.
or you could disable CONFIG_EFI_VARS, but the kernel shouldn't
crash like that.
// linux-266
// efivars_init and efivars_exit need to check efi_enabled
// instead of assuming that the system is using EFI;
