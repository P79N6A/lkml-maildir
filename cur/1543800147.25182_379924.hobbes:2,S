btw this caught one bug that the forced attribute was hiding: there was
a function which was "inline" and which uses a variable sized array.
normally gcc refuses to inline that (rightfully; esp relative addressing
gets rather really complex in that scenario), but the force attribute
causes it to be inlined anyway. No idea if the result is sane in that
case...
