There are many distributions, and all arrange such things
a bit different again. If you want to assign to these keys,
probably using loadkeys, then the ./sk command must precede
the loadkeys command. Maybe such stuff lives in /etc/rc.d/kbd
or maybe in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, or some such place.
There will be a default keymap somewhere that you will want to adapt.
