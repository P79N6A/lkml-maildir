Subject: missing last symbol in /proc/kallsyms

(2.6.5)
I want to see _einittext as the last (non-module) symbol in
/proc/kallsyms.
_einittext should be the last kernel image symbol listed in
/proc/kallsyms AFAICT (just before module symbols begin).
It (_einittext) is the last symbol listed in my
.tmp_kallsyms2.S file, but for some reason, it's not listed
in /proc/kallsyms.  I've beat my head on it for a little
while, so I'm hoping that someone else can see the problem.
(Zwane has also looked at it a bit.)
I modified scripts/kallsyms.c to print one more symbol at the
end of its list and to increase kallsyms_num_syms by 1, and
that does enable _einittext to be printed in /proc/kallsyms
(and the added symbol is not printed).
Without that change, the end of my /proc/kallsyms file contains:
c04e71d0 t af_unix_init
c04e7260 t packet_init
and the end of the corresponding .tmp_kallsyms2.S file contains:
        .byte 0x00
        .asciz  "af_unix_init"
        .byte 0x00
        .asciz  "packet_init"
        .byte 0x00
        .asciz  "_einittext"
Where is the off-by-1?  I want my _einittext.
