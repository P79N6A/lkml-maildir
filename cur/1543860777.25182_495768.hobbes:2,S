Yes, the 7 second timeout is fine.  It actually takes about 6.7 seconds.
I guess if "another popular OS" has a 7 second timeout that we won't find
multimedia devices out there that take longer than that.  :-)
My 15 seconds assumed that the observed case wasn't the worst case, but
it probably is.
This patch looks good.
Thanks
