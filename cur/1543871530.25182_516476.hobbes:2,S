Problem:
http://test.kernel.org/functional/index.html
lots of builds fell over because their binutils versions don't understand
rdtscp.
I don't know how recently rdtscp support was added to binutils, but
this is likely to be a problem.  Perhaps we can change this patch to
embed the hex code for that opcode instead?
