Could you CC the driver maintainer ? (ajoshi@unixbox.com) and me
on further updates please ? radeonfb is an important driver on PPC
boxes and some parts of it has to be handled with care ;)

Sounds fine

Good ;)

Yah, that never worked

What was wrong ? I'm not sure what you mean, we have been using fbset
and UseFBDev for ages on PPC

I don't agree here ! The palette _do_ make sense in 15/16/32, in which
case it's called gamma table. Don't break that, some apps do use it
(like MacOnLinux).

I'll give it a try and let you know.

Can't harm ;)
