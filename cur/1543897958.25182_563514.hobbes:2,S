In the case of S/PDIF output on ice1724 (and probably other cards), it 
would be nice if ALSA defaulted to routing default audio to both the 
S/PDIF and analog ports, as this is what most users would normally 
expect.. The Windows drivers work like that, but on Linux you have to 
pick one or the other (at least without a bunch of mucking with the 
config file).
