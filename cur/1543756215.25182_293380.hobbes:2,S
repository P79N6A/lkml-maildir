Sure, applied.  I would appreciated tests, however: you can download the
testsuite from the same place you get module-init-tools.  I don't expect
you to be able to compile for all endian/size combinations, but I can do
that for you.
You should also put the logic into the kernel's scripts/mod/file2alias,
which is where this is supposed to go these days (I haven't removed the
modules.XXX files, since hotplug has enough deployment problems without
me making things worse).
Thanks,
Rusty.
