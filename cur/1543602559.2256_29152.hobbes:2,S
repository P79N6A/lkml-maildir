That is an issue to take up with the glibc authors, not me.  If
something like this bothers you, then use a libc that does not include
kernel header files (which has been pointed out by the kernel authors
that they should not be doing.)  dietLibc [1] works for me quite well
and does not contain any kernel header files.

As Alan stated, to reduce confusion as to the wishes of the copyright
holders of the file.  3 out of the 4 current holders agree to this
wording, and as the dissenting party, you are free to disagree and keep
that wording from the file (however a small note in it detailing this
disagreement might be a nice thing to do.)
