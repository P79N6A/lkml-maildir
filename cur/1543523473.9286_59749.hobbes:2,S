All very true...

My suggestion would be to use the following rule set:
 1. Where a function accepts a 32-bit signed offset as a parameter,
    it should just sign extend that offset to 64-bit internally and
    use the resulting value. This can't cause any problems.
 2. Where a function returns a 32-bit signed offset, either as a
    parameter or as the return value of the function, and the value
    to be returned fits therein, it should return the value in the
    usual way. This applies irrespective of the actual size of the
    file in question.
 3. THE PROBLEM CASE: Where a function returns a 32-bit signed offset,
    either as a parameter or as the return value of the function, and
    the value to be returned does not fit therein, what happens?
    One thing to note is that in many programs, the actual value
    returned is never used, and we should not break those programs
    with whatever behaviour we choose. I would therefore suggest that
    the correct response would be to return -1 and set errno to
    ETOOBIG (or whatever it's called), and expect the program to
    respond to that with...
		signed u64 posn;
		posn = lseek(fp,0,SEEK_CUR);
		if (posn == -1 && errno == ETOOBIG)
		    posn = llseek(fp,0,SEEK_CUR);
    ...or the like.
Best wishes from Riley.
