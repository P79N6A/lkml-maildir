I too like to shell program.  Such potentially long vectors can
be worked in the shell, just not placed in a single command line
argument or environment variable.
Constructs that do work (using the list of process id's in the
file /dev/cpuset/tasks for these examples) include:
  1.  while read pid
      do
	  ... do something with each $pid ...
      done < /dev/cpuset/tasks
  2.  < /dev/cpuset/tasks xargs ps -flp
  3.  sed -un p < /dev/cpuset/foo/tasks > /dev/cpuset/tasks
Such shell constructs for dealing with vectors that might be longer
than argument or environment length limits have been needed and known
for decades.

Yes - what I call above a "vector."
