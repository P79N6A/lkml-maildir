Ok, I can take a look at that. I believe Arjan's been looking at the
upper end side of the equation.
On the small end, I think we need to take account for the fact
that:
- a bunch of stuff gets effectively pinned post-init
- there are fewer pages total so paging granularity is bad
- the desired size/performance ratio is heavily skewed towards size
..so I think the head of this curve is squeezing most of these hashes
down to order 0 or 1 for the first 16MB of RAM or so. 
On the large end, we obviously have diminishing returns for larger
hashes and lots of dirty cachelines for hash misses. We almost
certainly want sublinear growth here, but sqrt might be too
aggressive. Arjan?
For 2.7, I've been thinking about pulling out a generic lookup API,
which would allow replacing hashing with something like rbtree, etc.,
depending on space and performance criterion.
