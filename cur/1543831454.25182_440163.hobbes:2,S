The proposed patch does not modify that logic.

If pdflush sets current->backing_dev_info it means to ignore congested
device state.
It will not help to get reclaimed memory for pdflush but will increase
congestion, and pdflush will be dependent from swapping out process
using congested queue. The queue may be just congested because of memory
for queue. Other page could be better candidate for memory reclamation.
So, pdflush should not set this field.
