Please do not remove do_div though, I just went through XFS and made all
the
implicit 64 bit divides into explicit ones using do_div. Yes we really
do
have these in the code, fortunately not that many, and they are not just
things
which can be replaced by shifts, but they do all have the 64-by-32
property.
