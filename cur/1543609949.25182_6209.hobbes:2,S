There was however a general consensus that for small bugs that are found in a 'stable' release there should be fixes for just the bug as the next release.  I.E. 2.2.15 should be released with just the one fix.  Linus didn't seem to go for that as well as some other developers .

Well, Linus could post a 'errata' patch...
Layout now in ftp space is (reverse date order):
	test-kernels
	ChangeLog-2.4.14
	LATEST-IS-2.4.14
	linux-2.4.14.tar.bz2
A couple files could be posted, named Errata-2.4.14 and linux-2.4.14-errata.bz2,
first being a description of what the second (the patchs) cures...with names like
that so the listing gets them visible near the main tarball...
