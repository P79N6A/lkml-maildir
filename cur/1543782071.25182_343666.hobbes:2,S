Not terribly likely as the reboot does occur.  It looks more
like one of the drivers is leaving hardware in a state that
the BIOS cannot deal with it.
My gut feel says kexec one linux kernel from another would
be a quick way to check for the move obvious driver problems
in this area.
More simply might be to boot a minimal kernel with just
your root filesystem drivers and then keep adding drivers
until you have a kernel that fails.
The SMP reboot path did change in 2.6.10 but only very slightly.
