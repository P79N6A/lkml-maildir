both look good... I'd be in favor of this.
Maybe also add a part about using GFP_KERNEL whenever possible, GFP_NOFS
from filesystem writeout code and GFP_NOIO from block writeout code
(and never doing   in_interrupt()?GFP_ATOMIC:GFP_KERNEL !)

this.. does not really. GFP_DMA is an ancient artifact from the ISA
days. Better to describe the dma mapping interface (well give a pointer
to the doc that already exists about that), that one is REALLY for
allocating dma pages in this century.
