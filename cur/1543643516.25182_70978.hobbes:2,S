whoops, you're right.
That follows along with my suggestion in another email, then :)  use a 
semaphore.  The timeout can be handled with a kernel timer.  The timeout 
is clearly multiple seconds, so there's no fine grain involved.
AND, since the timeout is multiple seconds, the code should not be 
disable interrupts for that long anyway.
