Hi,
I'm using 2.4.21-rc6 with MSI MS-6378 rev3 mainboard and DURON.
When transmitting packets to on-board-ether-chip ADMtek AN938B over 2GB,
communication with other terminal via ethrnet  was stopped :-(
And,I ifconfig eth0 down and ifconfig eth0 up to reset ether,communication 
was restarted.
On board controller (ADMtek) displayed by lspci is below:
>00:0f.0 Ethernet controller: Linksys: Unknown device 9511 (rev 11)
Please....
Ohta
