Or to have some way of forcing the driver to check for a mouse after boot time 
- like you can tell SCSI controllers to check for new devices.
Or even better, to have the driver automatically notice when a mouse is 
plugged in, without intervention from the user at all. P'raps it should scan 
for a mouse whenever /dev/psaux is opened when a mouse isn't currently thought 
to be attached?
