What wonders me about the behaviour is that it is not consistent.
When I have the following situation: a box with twon nics, one 192.168.1.1,
ethernet adr aa , the other 192.168.1.2 ethernet adr bb
When I do an ARP request for 192.168.1.2, both respond. aa as wel as bb
But if I do another request for 192.168.1.2, and I direct it to the aa NIC,
it does not respond. Unless I turn on packet_forwarding (i.e. routing).
Remember, ARP is not routable, or shouldn't be, yet it is treated as such.
Regards,
Bas
