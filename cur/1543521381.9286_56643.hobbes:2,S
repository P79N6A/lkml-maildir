Well, it's up to the maintainer of the driver to decide whether the
driver should be surrounded with if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y"] ...
clauses and flagged (EXPERIMENTAL), or not. There might be problems for
other combinations of hardware than yours, for instance. But if you
feel it's working fine, try to contact the author/maintainer, and maybe
he'll change the status.
