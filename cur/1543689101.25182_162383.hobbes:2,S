	I agree with you, except for the one place where you've contradicted
yourself:

	In other words, you cannot release something under the GPL and
simultaneously restrict its use.

	So no, the kernel does not have the ability to reject closed source. That
would be an additional restriction upon use that the GPL does not allow you
to impose.
