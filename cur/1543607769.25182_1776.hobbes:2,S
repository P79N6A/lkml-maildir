  OK. I've seen the code and I agree it's not real problem.

  I just don't like the idea that when you do lookup you can suddenly get
Disk quota exceeded... I'd concern this behaviour a bit nonintuitive. I agree
that if root makes lookup of every file after moving directories then this
doesn't happen but still I don't like the design :).
