Subject: ioremap alignment question (kernel 2.2.13)

Greetings,
In working with a driver, I've discovered that if I ioremap() two
addresses which are not page aligned and within the same 4k block of
memory, doing a writel() to the remapped addresses generates a kernel
"Unable to handle kernel paging request."  I'm using kernel 2.2.13 for
ARM, though "slightly" ;) modified.
Questions:
- are there alignment requirements for ioremap()?
- can you ioremap() the same location more than once?
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt didn't address this.
Pointers to documentation, comments, questions, etc. welcomed.
TIA,
Eli
