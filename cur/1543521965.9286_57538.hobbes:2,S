If the page is not dirtied after we swapped it out last time,
it won't matter one bit for performance. If the page is dirtied
continuously we won't swap out that page either.
All the swap-everything, free later thing means is that we'll
incur a little extra I/O (in the background) and that it might
be easier/faster to free pages in the foreground, when we really
need them.

I don't think there will be that many side effects, except
perhaps a bit higher swap usage...
Of course, under certain workloads the two different tactics
will make a difference, but that can swing either way.
