Will you argue that people do things like
num = epoll_wait()
for (i=0; i<num; ++i) {
	process(event[i])?
}
Will you spawn thread per IO?
Stop writing the same again and again - I perfectly understand that not
everything can be easily covered by events, but covering everything with
threads is more stupid idea.
High-performance IO requires as small as possible overhead, dispatching
events from ring buffer or queue from each cpu is the smallest one, but
not spawning a thread per read.
