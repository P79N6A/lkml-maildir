Todays score:
7 days continuous test
one file data corruption on day 1
one file data corruption on day 4
two file data corruptions on day 6
Test is performed as follows:
around 70-100 GB of data is transferred to a nfs-server with rc8 onto a RAID5
on 3ware-controller.
The data is then copied via tar onto a SDLT drive connected to an aic
controller.
Afterwards the data is verified by tar.
Since rc8 this runs stable (froze before during the first day).
Whats left is that the verify done failes sometimes (see above). It does not
look like a write error to tape, because retrying the verify cycle the errors
occur in other files most of the time (or even none at all). It seems reading
back is the problem. I doubt the problem lies on the 3ware side, because this
would mean you cannot use it at all (there should be errors all over other
actions as well then).
Most of the several files tar'ed are beyond the 2 GB file size. They vary from
around 100MB upto about 15 GB per file, around 70 GB minimum summed up.
Of course I exchanged the tapes and the drive. Didn't get better.
Regards,
Stephan
