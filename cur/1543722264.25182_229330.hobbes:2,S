Hi Denis,
You'd be surprised how many people are still running Redhat 7.3 or howmany 
people are still running some version of Linux 2.4.2x. Sometimes its not easy 
telling the customer to upgrade to the latest Linux kernel from www.kernel.org 
because they don't have the expertise to compile kernels - heck some 
distributions don't even install gcc/make unless you select "Development System" 
during installation. (FreeBSD is more sane in that regard that they install 
gcc/make with the base system).
best regards
Dev Mazumdar
