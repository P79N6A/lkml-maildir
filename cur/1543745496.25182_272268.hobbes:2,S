Andi, Zwane
I will send in the following by evening -
1) dmidecode output
2) normal dmesg output (No Timer override, with ACPI with thermal stuff) - This gives me many lost ticks 
3) dmesg output with NV Timer override with apic - This gives me NMI errors and IDE DMA timeouts 
4) dmesg output with NV Timer override with noapic - Not tried yet
5) lspci output
Let me know if anything else is needed.
Thanks!
Parry
