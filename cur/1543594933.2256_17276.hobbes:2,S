Hello!

If I remember correctly, it has threaded timer pool, but timers still acquire
global bh lock, so that the things become only worse. Apparently,
it is invisible at first sight because bulk work typical for tux and triggered
by timers, is moved to cpu local tasklets (garbage collection: time wait etc.).

Sort of.

In generic server case, yes.
But also add BH_IMMEDIATE and BHs, used by hordes of devices.

Yes.
But, in any case, global BHs are not a pathalogy: they were handy tool,
allowing to hide lots of spinlocks. And not plain spinlocks, but
asynchronous ones. It was pretty light, but had latency up to 1/HZ
in the worst case. Now they have unreasonably strict latency
(useless, as rule) but eat cpu instead.
