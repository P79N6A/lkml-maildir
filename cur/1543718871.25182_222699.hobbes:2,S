That's taken care of already; the stack frames are linked together on
ppc64, and show_stack follows those links.  The change to validate_sp
means that we treat stack addresses as valid if they are on the
process stack or on the hardirq or softirq stack for the cpu that the
process is on.
We have in fact been using this patch in some pretty intensive testing
and we have seen stack traces (from other bugs :) that do hop from one
stack to another.  So I am confident that it does work.
Regards,
Paul.
