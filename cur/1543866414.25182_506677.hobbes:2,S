Maybe you should read my first post, we're talking about gcc's behavior 
here, not the C standard.  My criticism was that any compiler that makes 
a_variable.flag unsigned is brain-dead and I was arguing in favor of gcc 
treating plain int bitfields as signed ints (6.7.2, 6.7.2.1).  This has 
_nothing_ to do with the fact that the standard leaves it implementation 
defined.
Naturally you should define it's signness explicitly in your code since it 
is implementation defined.  That's not the point.
Just because a compiler CAN consider a_variable.flag as unsigned doesn't 
mean it makes sense.  It makes no sense, and thus is brain-dead.
