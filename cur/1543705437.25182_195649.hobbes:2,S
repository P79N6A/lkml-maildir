Well just run something that uses a lot of memory and doesn't
do much else. Run a few of these if you like:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define MEMSZ (64 * 1024 * 1024)
int main(void)
{
    int i;
    char *mem = malloc(MEMSZ);
    for (i = 0; i < MEMSZ; i+=4096)
       mem[i] = i;
    sleep(60);
    return 0;
}

Thanks. Much the same, isn't it?
Can you try booting with the kernel argument: elevator=deadline
and see how 2.6 goes?
Andrew, any other ideas?
