Although the keyboard (keyboard.c) and terminal (vt.c) both have "UTF-8
modes", there are still a couple of short-comings at the kernel level.
  * compose tables use 8-bit characters,
  * selection doesn't copy/paste UTF-8.
(OK, so there are many more, but these two are the ones that make
it inconvenient to even use extended Latin characters.)
Here is a patch against 2.5.70 that fixes selection.  It uses the
existing Unicode font information (ushorts) to create an inverse mapping.
