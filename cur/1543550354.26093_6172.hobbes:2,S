Can someone explain why core dumping can't be done in userspace?
Probably a deficiency in my binary file format education but I don't
get it.  It seems as though libpthreads could install a SEGV handler by
default that would increment a shared got-core-signal variable and
re-send the SEGV to all other threads, then each dump out its own stack
and register context and have one of them dump the memory.  (This
collapses to a much simpler handler in libc for non-threaded code.)
Sure it means libc gets a nifty new complex function perhaps linked
against libbfd, but in terms of memory footprint you don't pay that
price until something crashes.
There must be a good reason Unix and Linux don't do this ... but I
haven't thought of it yet.  Anyone care to enlighten me?
