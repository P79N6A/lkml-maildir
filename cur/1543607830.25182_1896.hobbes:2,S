i had something like that in mind.

what about changing doing
	spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
	sigfillset(&current->blocked);	/* block all sig's */
	recalc_sigpending(current);
	spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
instead of 
	spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
	sigemptyset(&current->blocked);  
	recalc_sigpending(current);
	spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
and replacing the signal_pending() stuff in the loops of
rtl8139_thread() with checks for tp->diediedie?
