Guy... .
I KNOW what the patch above does.
What do you think does the following line?
	err = request_module("rfkill-input");
Does it load the "rfkill-input" or the "rfkill" module.
That's the million dollar question. You only have one try.
This patch is NOT about the "rfkill" module. I don't know how
often I have to say that. It is _obvious_.
Let's also quote Larry's sevenths point here, that you referred to
now for the second time:
" (7) If rfkill-input is built as a module, it is not automatically loaded."
I am not sure how I can make this any more clear.
It does load the "rfkill-input" module from within b43.
It does NOT load "rfkill"
It does NOT load "rfkill-input" BEFORE b43 was loaded.
This patch does exactly ONE thing. It does make sure a LED does blink.
Nothing more.
I signed this patch off. So you can be 100% sure I know what it does.
I do NOT sign off patches for which I don't know what they do.

Did you try that?
How can b43 load get fixed by a patch that adds a request_module()
to the b43 module? That is a chicken and egg problem!

yes properly written userspace.

I am running wireless-2.6 on feisty. So the kernel does _not_ require
an update of the distribution.

You are telling me that I don't understand patches that I sign off
and I should not take this personally?
That is challenging.
