uh, this will be unpleasantly familiar to anyone who
was reading the linux-usb mailing list in Dec 99,
when George said, roughly "you are all so full of shit
that you're not worth working with, so on Monday we will begin 
designing our own USB for Linux".
Linux USB has survived quite nicely in spite of this,
which bodes quite well for ARM-linux ;)
