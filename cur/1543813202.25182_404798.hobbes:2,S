Subject: [PATCH 000 of 14] knfsd: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following series of patches changes the code for lookup up
authentication/authorisation caches in sunrpc as used by nfsd.  That
than having a delightful macro that defines a function of a particular
type of cache, the functions are coded on a more traditional manner
using library routines.
This will hopefully make the code more maintainable.
This series should not effect the functionality at all -- except maybe
to fix some very minor bugs
This is against 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 and is NOT suitable for 2.6.16, but maybe for .17
(though holding it back to .18 wouldn't be a big problem if any issues came up).
Thanks,
NeilBrown
