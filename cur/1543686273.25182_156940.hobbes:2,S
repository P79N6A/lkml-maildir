Why don't you try using an LVM2 stripe? That's the same as raid0 does.
And I'm sure it doesn't suffer from such problems because it's handling
bios in a very generic and flexible manner.
Looking at the code:
chunk_size = mddev->chunk_size >> 10;
block = bio->bi_sector >> 1;
if (unlikely(chunk_size < (block & (chunk_size - 1)) + (bio->bi_size >>
10))) { ...
/* Sanity check -- queue functions should prevent this happening */
if (bio->bi_vcnt != 1 ||
    bio->bi_idx != 0)
        goto bad_map; /* -> error message */
So, it looks like queue functions don't prevent this from happening.
md.c:
blk_queue_max_sectors(mddev->queue, chunk_size >> 9);
blk_queue_segment_boundary(mddev->queue, (chunk_size>>1) - 1);
I'm wondering, why can't there be more than one bvec?
