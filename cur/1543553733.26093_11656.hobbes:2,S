   Because this will add a Fallback (non ECN) packet to every denied
   target. I think this is bad policy at least. It might violate the
   RFCs, too. Keep in mind, we cannot recognice a rejection due to
   ECN.
It does in fact violate RFCs because the fallback has to handle the
case where ECN rejection comes in the form of a (perfectly valid)
TCP reset.
Any workaround which ignores TCP resets is broken from the start and
is not to be implemented.
