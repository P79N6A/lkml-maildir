urgh.  It was ages ago.  I shouldn't have stuck my head up ;)
I guess it was 256 megs:
Kernel command line: ...  mem=256m
Page-cache hash table entries: 65536 (order: 6, 262144 bytes)
And that's one entry per page, yes?
I ended up concluding that
a) The hash is sucky and
b) Except for certain specialised workloads, a lookup is usually
   associated with a big memory copy, so none of it matters and
c) given b), the page cache hashtable is on the wrong side of the
   size/space tradeoff :)
