It's always very critical if a userspace program can modify some
data in the kernel. Be it function pointers or plain data.
Also consider something like:
if (task->uid == 0)
	allow_access_to_time_machine();
else
	return -EPERM;
Now if "task" may be a NULL pointer (due to a bug) it
can be exploited.
