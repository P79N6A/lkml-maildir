It flushes icache at fault time, I know. What I don't know is why we
leave them to drift out of sync afterwards.

No, I mean places that set PG_arch_1. flush_dcache_page. This can
happen for mapped pages in write, splice, install_arg_page looks
questionable, direct IO...
Actually there are various windows where mapped pages can be !uptodate,
so there is technically most of the filesystem code as well, but I'm
trying to stamp those out, so let's ignore that for now.
What if you were to say remove all the PG_arch_1 code, and do something
really simple like flush icache in flush_dcache_page? Would performance
suffer horribly?
