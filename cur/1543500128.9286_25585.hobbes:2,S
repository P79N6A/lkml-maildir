Steven,
I believe they have switched to the posix stuff.  The include file GLOBALS.H
pulls in the includes for the entire build, so you only have to conditional
it in one place.  If you can figure out the vodoo sequence of includes files
for GLOBALS.H that will work with my build, and send it to me, I'll post a
new version on the site, and add you as a contributor.  I am trying to get
the NetWare specific stuff finished or I would do this for you, but I would
love some help with 2.2 and 2.3 as well as the other linux versions if you
want to pitch in.  If you get it fixed, just upload it to the incoming
directory on my ftp server (you have rights to do so).  and I'll post it to
the world as a new release.
Your friend,
Jeff
