Not really a kernel question, but anyhow..
'man 2 link' and 'man 2 symlink' will tell you that the system calls only make
one link at a time.  What /bin/ln does is a userspace question, but Kerhnigan
and Pike would likely say the Right Answer is:
% for i in target1 target2 target3; do ln link-name $i; done
If you're asking something else, such as "How do I hardlink a directory to more
than one parent?", that *is* a kernel question, but the generic answer is "You
don't, unless you have a novel way to identify the Right Answer for 'where does
../ point?'".  Check the archives, it was beaten to death a few weeks ago....
