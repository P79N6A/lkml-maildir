He's trying to use gcc 3.3.2 which isn't packaged in toolchain-source
yet.  And he's running on a RedHat-like system.
And there's currently a problem:  To build gcc you need access to an
appropriate libc6 header package; dpkg-cross refuses to install one
without linux-kernel-headers-cross-ia64; but will also not install
linux-kernel-headers.  You need the patch at
