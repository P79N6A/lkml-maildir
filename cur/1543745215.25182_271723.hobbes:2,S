Ignoring the referenced bit should also make the system
"immune" from the "fake" references that the swap token
holding task will show.
However, since it also ignores real referenced bits, it
might mess up VM balancing a bit, which is what Andrew
was worried about.

Actually, because Andrew's patch makes the real referenced
bit stand, but ignores the "fake" reference that the swap
token gives, I suspect it'll make this swap token corner
case a lot "softer" than my patch.
