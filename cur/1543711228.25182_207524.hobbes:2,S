| No it wasn't NET_POLL_CONTROLLER (I didn't enable it).
| 
| I split the bk2->bk3 patch in pieces, and traced the bug to the
| netdev_priv() change in in loopback.c. The bug is that loopback's
| dev is static and its ->priv actually points to kmalloc:d space.
| The netdev_priv() transformation is invalid for anything not
| allocated with alloc_etherdev or alloc_netdev, so the patch
| to loopback caused it to access and clobber static memory just
| after its own dev.
| 
| It was my bad luck that tulip was the victim of that clobber.
| 
| Reverting the patch below solves the problem.

Thanks for checking, and sorry about the trouble.
BTW, the loopback patch has already been reverted.
