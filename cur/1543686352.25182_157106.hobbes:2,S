You can use the same workaround as x86-64. add an exception handler and
just jump back. Advantage is that it is completely outside the fast path.
But note you also have to add runtime sorting of __ex_table when you
do this, otherwise the __ex_table becomes unsorted when someone uses
list_for_each (which does prefetch) in a __init function
(all code is available in x86-64, just needs to be ported over)
