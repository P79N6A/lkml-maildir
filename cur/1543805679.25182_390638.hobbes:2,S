It is done inside the crypto/ framework. crypto/dsa.c implements the DSA 
signing as a hash crypto algorithm (since a DSA signature is two 160-bit 
integers, the result has a fixed size).
The above patch just adds the syscall to tell the in-kernel system that 
you wish to encrypt/sign something with a given key. In the case that 
the type of the given key is a DSA key, security/keys/dsa_key.c uses the 
dsa crypto alg from crypto/dsa.c to satisfy that request.
