One problem is that there is no explanation how it happened.
The other problem is that in the Apple driver or tools I haven't found an 
equivalent (unless you disable journaling completely), there is simply no 
special handling of a zero in this field.
I find it more likely that some repair tool simply sets this field to 
zero, so it forces the OS X driver to reinitialize the journal file. It 
might help to look at the last_mount field to have some idea who accessed 
the volume last.
So your first patch is kinda trivial, although most of comment isn't 
needed and is irrelevant to the patch itself, however I don't see a reason
to apply the second patch.
bye, Roman
