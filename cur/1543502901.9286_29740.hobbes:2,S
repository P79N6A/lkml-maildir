You can't query section alignment.  I'm somewhat surprised
you care.  My guess is that you are disecting assembly files
and re-assembling them somehow?

Well it isn't the compilers that are wrong.  It is clearly
their perogative to align loop labels and such as they desire.
Recall that you can use the -mfunction-alignment and whatnot
command-line options, though I'd recommend not.
