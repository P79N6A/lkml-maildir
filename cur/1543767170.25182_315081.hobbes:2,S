I patched it to 2.6.11, and it compiles okey.  On boot, it prints
    "Waiting for root device to wake us up."
then it waits for my USB key to register.  After USB partition info
prints to screen, above message is printed
    "Waiting for root device to wake us up."
again.  Then, it just hangs forever.
