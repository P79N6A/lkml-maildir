Hans,
I would call stack use like this a bug fix. Let me explain why: in the
2.4 kernel you ALREADY have effectively a 4Kb stack (it's 8Kb but when
you subtract 1.6Kb for the task struct and about 2Kb for soft/hardirq
context about 4Kb is left). It's just more of a lottery there about
if/when you get hit by an irq or not, while with 4KSTACKS in 2.6 the
odds of the lottery changed. I'm sure that as maintainer of a filesystem
that, as you say, is critical and holds peoples email an other critical
data, you rather not play odds at all, regardless of what they are, and
want to play for certainty.
