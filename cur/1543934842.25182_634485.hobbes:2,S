sysfs_get_dentry(),
                mutex_lock(&parent->d_inode->i_mutex);
hitting parent->d_inode either NULL or very close to it, depending on your
.config; most likely NULL, if offset of i_mutex is 0xb8 in your build.
That's plausible - 0xb8 is what you'd get on UP build without spinlock
debugging, lockdep, etc.
Assuming that this is what we get, everything looks explainable - we
have sysfs_rename_dir() calling sysfs_get_dentry() while the parent
gets evicted.  We don't have any exclusion, so while we are playing
silly buggers with lookups in sysfs_get_dentry() we have parent become
negative; the rest is obvious...
AFAICS, the locking here is quite broken and frankly, sysfs_get_dentry()
and the way it plays with fs/namei.c are ucking fugly.
Could you stick
	if (!parent->d_inode)
		printk(KERN_WARNING "sysfs locking blows: %s",
			parent->d_name.name);
right before
                mutex_lock(&parent->d_inode->i_mutex);
                dentry = lookup_one_noperm(cur->s_name, parent);
                mutex_unlock(&parent->d_inode->i_mutex);
in sysfs_get_dentry() (fs/sysfs/dir.c) and verify that it does, indeed,
trigger?
