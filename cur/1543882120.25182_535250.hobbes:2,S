Hmm...sounds reasonable. 
I have 2 idea for automatic way..
(1)Use new zonelist ordering always and move init_task's tied cpu to a
  cpu on the best node. 
  Child processes will start in good nodes even if Node 0 has small memory.
(2) Set Node's local highest zone to the top of zonelist.
I like (1). Does anyone have an idea ?
