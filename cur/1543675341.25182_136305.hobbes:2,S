I also didn't like them too much and where they looked like they could
hurt I resorted to the verify_area trick instead (which didn't work 
for you...) 
I believe the remaining limits are harmless, but of course it's cleaner
to not have them.
If you use the function that extensively it would be better to allow
it to nest (e.g. add a field for the current offset in  task struct). 
Otherwise someone will get it wrong sooner or later.
(like the sock/tw_bucket ;)

Ok thanks. I will port it to my 2.4 code.
Did you test them all?
