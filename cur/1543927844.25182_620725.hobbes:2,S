Then on each kick, all queues have to be checked for processing?  What 
devices do you expect this would help?

I would have to look, but since rx/tx are rather independent actions, 
I'm not sure that you would really save that much.  You still end up 
doing the same number of kicks unless I'm missing something.

I'm wary of introducing the notion of hypercalls to this device because 
it makes the device VMM specific.  Maybe we could have the device 
provide an option ROM that was treated as the device "BIOS" that we 
could use for kicking and interrupt acking?  Any idea of how that would 
map to Windows?  Are there real PCI devices that use the option ROM 
space to provide what's essentially firmware?  Unfortunately, I don't 
think an option ROM BIOS would map well to other architectures.

If you're doing restore by passing the PCI config blob to a registered 
routine, then sure, but that doesn't seem much better to me than just 
having the device generate that blob in the first place (which is what 
we have today).  I was assuming that you would want to use the existing 
PIO/MMIO handlers to do restore by rewriting the config as if the guest was.

We may run out of PCI slots though :-/

I don't think they're really any worse :-)
