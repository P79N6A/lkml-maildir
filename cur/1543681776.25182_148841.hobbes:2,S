hmm, I really wonder why I don't see any difference for my box.
1. "make -j2 bzImage modules" slows down my box alot.
2. kmail is slow like a dog while make -j2
3. xterm needs ~5seconds while make -j2 to open up
4. xmms does not skip
5. I've tried Felipe's suggestions, they are:
	#define PRIO_BONUS_RATIO        45
	#define INTERACTIVE_DELTA       4
	#define MAX_SLEEP_AVG           (HZ)
	#define STARVATION_LIMIT        (HZ)
   At least with these changes kmail is much much faster but still not
   as fast as w/o the compilation. Xterm needs ~5seconds to open up.
6. Xterm: "ls -lsa" in a directory with ~1200 files
	2.6.0-test1-mm1 + O6int:
	------------------------
	real    0m12.468s
	user    0m0.170s
	sys     0m0.057s
	2.4.20-wolk4.4: O(1) from latest -aa tree
	-----------------------------------------
	real    0m0.689s
	user    0m0.031s
	sys     0m0.011s
7. playing an mpeg with mplayer while "make -j2 bzImage modules" let the movie
   skip some frames every ~10 seconds.
8. I've also tried min_timeslice == max_timeslice (10) w/o much difference :-(
   I remember that this helped alot in earlier 2.5 kernels.
I have to say that the XMMS issue is really less important for me. I want a 
kernel where I can "make -j<huge number> bzImage modules" and don't notice 
that compilation w/o renicing all the gcc instances.
Machine:
--------
Celeron 1,3GHz
512MB RAM
2x IDE (UDMA100) 60/40 GB
1GB SWAP, 512MB on each disk (same priority)
ext3fs (data=ordered)
anticipatory I/O scheduler
XFree 4.3
WindowMaker 0.82-CVS
Is my box the only one on earth which don't like the scheduler fixups? ;)
ciao, Marc
