  Umm. I think this change does not help much - you solve the problem
for the first page but then you unlock that page and you'd like to lock
the next one and you're again in trouble (trying to acquire PageLock
wile holding transaction open).
  I can see three solutions of the problem:
Either do ext3_journal_start/stop for each page - you should be actually
getting the handle of the same transaction until the transaction gets
filled. But still you'll have some overhead of the calls in JBD. I
actually don't see much difference to the approach we used before your
patch but probably there's some.
  Or rewrite __mpage_writepages() to lock a page range (e.g. lock pages
until we find some on which we'd block) and then call some filesystem
routine to write-out all the locked pages (which would start a
transaction and so on). But this is more work.
  Finally there's the theoretical ;) possibility to rewrite all the
write-out code and change the lock ordering to journal->PageLock...
