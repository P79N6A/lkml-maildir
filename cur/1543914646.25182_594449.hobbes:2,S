fsblock is restricted to the page cache and cannot be used in other 
contexts where subsystems can benefit from larger linear memory.

That is again pretty undifferentiated. Are we talking about low page 
orders? There we will reclaim the all of reclaimable memory before getting 
an -ENOMEM. Given the quantities of pages on todays machine--a 1 G machine 
has 256 milllion 4k pages--and the unmovable ratios we see today it 
would require a very strange setup to get an allocation failure while 
still be able to allocate order 0 pages.
With the ZONE_MOVABLE you can remove the unmovable objects into a defined 
pool then higher order success rates become reasonable.

Yes sure. You code could not live without these approaches. Without the 
antifragmentation measures your fsblock code would not be very successful 
in getting the larger contiguous segments you need to improve performance.
(There is no new mmap layer, the higher order pagecache is simply the old 
API with set_blocksize expanded).

Well then I guess that you have not read the requirements...

Thats not me. I am working on this because many of the filesystem people 
have repeatedly asked me to do this. I am no expert on filesystems.

Therefore it is not a generic change but special to the block layer. So 
other subsystems still have to deal with the single page issues on 
their own.

Why: It is the same approach that you use. If it is barely ever used and 
satisfies your concern then I am fine with it.

The largeblock changes are generic. They improve general handling of 
compound pages, they make the existing APIs work for large units of 
memory, they are not adding additional new API layers.
