I'm not familiar with the internals of the module unloading code.
However, my understanding of the discussion so far is that the kernel
will refuse to unload a module while any of its kobjects still have
nonzero reference counts (either by waiting for the reference counts
to hit 0 or returning -EBUSY).
If this is the case, then I don't see any harm in declaring kobjects
statically.  Declaring a kobject statically is simpler than
dynamically allocating and freeing it.  Am I still missing something?
