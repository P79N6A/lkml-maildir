what if the people administering the container are different from the 
people administering the host?
in that case the people working in the container want to be able to 
implement and change their own policy, and the people working on the host 
don't want to have to implement changes to their main policy config (wtih 
all the auditing that would be involved with it) every time a container 
wants to change it's internal policy.
I can definantly see where a container aware policy on the master would be 
useful, but I can also see where the ability to nest seperate policies 
would be useful.
