Yeah... unfortunately, in chip design, you can't really avoid that. 
VHDL has structures which allow you to aggregate different signals, but 
Verilog doesn't have that feature, so you end up with hundreds of module 
parameters sometimes.  That's when pass-by-name really pays off.
But then again, everything you know about software development is 
completely goes out the window when doing chip design.  (i.e. in C, less 
code usually produces better results.  The opposite is true in Verilog.)
