When I attempt to write a CD-R, I get the following:
cdrecord: Input/output error. write_g1: scsi sendcmd: retryable error

cdrecord: fifo had 128 puts and 1 gets.
cdrecord: fifo was 0 times empty and 0 times full, min fill was 100%.
Can somebody possbly shed some light on this?  I am unsure where to look
for further information.
Thanks,
Mike.
