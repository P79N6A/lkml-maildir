Ok, so I grabbed a 128Mb PentiumII 266MHz and tested on it.
The results are:
(still kernel compile, suggest something else and I'll try too)
    kernel:           memory (code,reserved,data,init):  compile time:
stock 2.2.0-pre7         768k,404k,1744k,28k              5m 29s 75
2.2.0-pre7 + my patch    768k,404k,1488k,28k              5m 29s 25
So I really say there is no visible performance change,
I just gained 256k of RAM.

P.S. I also looked at the way gcc optimizes this:
mem_map_t *a, *b;
unsigned long map_nr = a - b;
It uses the multiplication trick Colin Plumb explained to divide by
sizeof(mem_map_t), but combines a few leal, addl, sarl, sall instaed
of using an imull.
I checked on a 386 manual (yep, not a pentium or pentiumII manual, true)
for the cycles they need, and they resulted quite faster both than
imull and idivl.
P.S. The memory usage peak during compile was 60Mb.
