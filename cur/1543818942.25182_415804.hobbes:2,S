I agree that O_APPEND is important to get correct. However, would that also 
handle the specific case of stdout redirection to a file? (ie "a.out > 
result", not just "a.out >> result" - the latter incidentally does not 
currently seem to fail, at least with my tests)

The POSIX 1003.1-2001 spec seems to provide a very clear guarantee of 
thread-safety behavior wrt threads:
2.9.1 Thread-Safety
All functions defined by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 shall be 
thread-safe, except that the following functions need not be thread-safe.
    <omitted list of functions, which does not include write>
Implementations shall provide internal synchronization as necessary in order 
to satisfy this
requirement.
...
2.9.7 Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations
All of the functions chmod( ), close( ), fchmod( ), fcntl( ), fstat( ), 
ftruncate( ), lseek( ), open( ), read( ), readlink( ), stat( ), symlink( ), 
and write( ) shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects 
specified in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 when they operate on regular files. If two 
threads each call one of these functions, each call shall either see all of 
the specified effects of the other call, or none of them.
Unless I'm missing something, that doesn't leave much ambiguity regarding 
what's required for POSIX compliance on this issue (although I'm not sure 
POSIX compliance is the right metric).
