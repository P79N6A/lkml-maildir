Hi:
   I'm using 2.4.17-pre5 on an Atlhon 1000 Gz & Nvidia Gforce 2 Pro, when I
load Rivafb the computers freeze.... If I put rivafb in modules when I do
insmod rivafb I can change to another tty and lsmod shows " rivafb
(inizializating) " forever.... I tried this without using NVIDIA kernel
modules. My .config is attached. Rivafb works fine with this card or is a
bug in the module?
