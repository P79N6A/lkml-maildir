I have this same problem on my Compaq Presario. I think that this
is because the BIOS was shadowed and used some writable-RAM somewhere.
Linux seems to do a 'warm-boot'. The result being that some of the
stuff that the BIOS counts on was wiped out by Linux, i.e.,
stuff from E000:0000 -> E000:FFFF (the BIOS is normally at F000:0000).
My 'fix' is to cold-boot, i.e., processor reset during the shutdown.
Cheers,
