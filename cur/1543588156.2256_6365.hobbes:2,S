First one gets a mail saying that the mail sent is queued for moderator
approval, since I'm not on the list. Then later a second mail arrives,
saying the mail has been rejected by the moderator.
I then reply to the admin mail listed, in not-so-kind words (yes I was
pissed off). Haven't heard anything.
