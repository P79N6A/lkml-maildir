Hi,
I'm looking for a way to access 64 or 128 bit of device space in a single 
access. For smaller accesses I use ioread32() and friends. But which way 
should I do it for the next bigger accesses? Casting the iospace to something 
like u64* looks very suspicious to me. Any better ideas?
Greetings,
Eike
