Okay, thanks, I know nothing of that, and must defer to those who do.
But it sounds broken to me, in the way that you have described.
And the fix would not be to change the kernel's semantics for private
mappings, but for the app to use a shared mapping instead of a private.
Which would indeed be more work for the app than just using malloc,
since it needs some memory object (e.g. tmpfs file?) to map shared.
