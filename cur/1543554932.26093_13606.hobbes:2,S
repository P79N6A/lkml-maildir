The program would be broken if it executed CPUID itself, because it has no way to guarantee
that the CPUID is executed on all CPUs the scheduler may later move the task too.
I think it is also nasty to break non broken programs this way, looking for 
flags in /proc/cpuinfo is the only reliable way to do the checks on 2.2.
