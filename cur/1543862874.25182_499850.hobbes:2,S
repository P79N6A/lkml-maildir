Ok I tried it but this wont work unless I also pass the page struct pointer to 
__mark_inode_dirty() since the dirty_node pointer could be freed 
when the inode_lock is droppped. So I cannot dereference the 
dirty_nodes pointer outside of __mark_inode_dirty. 
If I expand __mark_inode_dirty then all variations of mark_inode_dirty() 
need to be changed and we need to pass a page struct everywhere. This 
result in extensive changes.
I think I need to stick with the tree_lock. This also makes more sense 
since we modify dirty information in the address_space structure and the 
radix tree is already protected by that lock.
