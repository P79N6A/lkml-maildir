The correct address for glibc problems is either bug-glibc@gnu.org or
libc-alpha@sourceware.cygnus.com.  Sorry, that you heard nothing.

;-)

Have a look at Andries' email and also at the glibc FAQ 3.5.  Linus
asked us to reduce the usage of kernel headers to a minimum.  The old
scsi.h and sg.h were not usable since they've got internal kernel data
and also external information.  Therefore glibc comes with its own
headers.

Nope - you should strive to work with us so that this doesn't happen.
The information in scsi.h and sg.h should be independend of the kernel
version and therefore can live in glibc.
This leads to duplication but that's the way Linus likes to have it.
For most of the information that's duplicated, we (glibc developers)
try to get changes into the glibc sources asap.  Sorry, that we've
missed to update the scsi headers so far.
I'm taking the scsi headers from 2.3.26 as reference and will try to
come up with a patch for glibc that I will send to for reviewing.
Andreas
P.S. Let's discuss this further privatly, I've set a reply-to.
