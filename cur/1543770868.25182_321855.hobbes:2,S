Thank you, James. Now please tell that to Bill. It would seem
that I haven't written enough "RT media apps" for him to take
me seriously ;)

No, I clarified the point that the direction the RT people want
to go in is hard-realtime in the Linux kernel.
I'm very well aware of what the actual current PREEMPT_RT patch is,
and I was never talking about that particular patch.

Yes, Jack is more of a soft realtime application, and in that case
Linux supports it already today (although perhaps not very well -
something the RT patch aims to improve).

It seems that you do understand my position now, yes.
I'll try to refrain from posting further, too.
