I'm just gonna ack Alan's patch.
* ATA_FLAG_NO_LEGACY is not really used widely (and thus LLDs don't set
it rigorously).  I think it should be removed once we get initialization
model right.
* I'm really reluctant to add more LLD-specific knowledge into libata
core.  We're already carrying too much due to the current init model
(libata should initialize host according to probe_ent, so many
weirdities should be represented in probe_ent in a form libata core
understands).
* The idea of clearing simplex for unknown controllers scares the hell
out of me.  where's mummy...
So, I'll ask bug reporter of #7590 to test it.
