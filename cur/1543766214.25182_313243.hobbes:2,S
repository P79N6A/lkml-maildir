On newer kernels with the posix timers (I think 2.6 - not sure though)
there's clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...).

I bet most users of gettimeofday actually want a strictly monotonic
increasing clock where the actual base time is irrelevant.  Just strace
some apps - those issuing hundreds and thousands of gettimeofday calls
are most likely in this class.  Those who only call gettimeofday once
or twice or the ones that really want the wall clock time.
How often does the kernel use jiffies (the monotonic clock) and how often
xtime (the wall clock)?
Ciao, ET.
