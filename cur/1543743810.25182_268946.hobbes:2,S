Running 2.6.9 32bit here on a Tyan Thunder K8W with BIOS 2.02.
Is a new system, started with BIOS 1.02, built the kernel with CONFIG_HPET
and CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ enabled.  No issues, but no messages about HPET
during boot.
Updated to current BIOS (that among other things adds an enable/disable
HPET option) and I have the same issues, system hang on HPET calabration,
with an opps several minutes later.  Disable the HPET in BIOS and the
system boots just fine (but no HPET).
