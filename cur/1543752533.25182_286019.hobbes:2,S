Apart from the fact that someone writing mail as root can't be
taken seriously I would suggest that you
a) take the discussion elsewhere because it is more than off-topic
b) stop smoking the pipe
c) consider renaming your project to balla-balla because that one
    is easier to remember and somewhat fits the description of your
    goals
Servus,
