- input prompt: "prompt" <prompt> ["if" <expr>]
  Every menu entry can have at most one prompt, which is used to display
  to the user. Optionally dependencies only for this prompt can be added
  with "if".
---
This is misleading, since the "if" will not affect only the prompt, but 
also the config option. 
Therefore I can't use
config SGI_IOC4
    tristate
    prompt "SGI IOC4 Base IO support" if PROMPT_FOR_UNUSED_CORES
    depends on (IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_SN2) && MMTIMER
    default n
to hide this option unless PROMPT_FOR_UNUSED_CORES is selected.
Since the "if" is useless, misleading and redundand with this behaviour, I 
suggest stripping it out.
