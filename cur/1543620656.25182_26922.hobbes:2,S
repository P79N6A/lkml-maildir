The discussion was about pci_alloc_consistent. The free case seems to be
explicitly disallowed in all cases.
(from DMA-mapping.txt)
To unmap and free such a DMA region, you call:
        pci_free_consistent(dev, size, cpu_addr, dma_handle);
where dev, size are the same as in the above call and cpu_addr and
dma_handle are the values pci_alloc_consistent returned to you.
This function may not be called in interrupt context.
