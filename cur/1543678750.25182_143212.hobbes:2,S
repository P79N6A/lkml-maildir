Maybe I'm low on caffeine and therefor misreading it, but isn't this just an
example of "file rename/remove requires write permission on the *parent*
dirctory, since that's what's being changed", which often surprises novice (and
not-so-novice) sysadmins?  See also the reason for the sticky bit on directories..
In any case, I didn't notice that any behavior (other than the 'chown giveaway')
was different than other filesystems?
