If you only get such a message occasionally, it probably indicates
some race in the swapin code; probably not a new problem, but one now
made more visible by Rik's vm_swap_full swap deletion (as Alan hinted).
The race may well be benign.
But I'm guessing: I ought to understand this, but I don't.
The message I would expect you to get occasionally is the equivalent
message from swap_duplicate(), but that would be differently worded
("Unused swap offset entry in swap_dup 0044cb00").  The one you see
either comes from __swap_free() or from get_swaphandle_info():
I wonder which?
If you're still getting such messages, please let me know and
I'll send a test patch to make the message more informative.
Is this an SMP machine?
Hugh
