Looking at that whole commit, it looks bogus.
The rule about ACPI memory (whether NVS or not) according to what I have 
seen is that the OS is _not_ supposed to touch that memory except through 
ACPI routines.
So saving and restoring those pages sounds really really wrong in the 
first place. We have no idea what current state it could screw up.
Shaohua?
