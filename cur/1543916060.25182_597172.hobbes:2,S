I don't think it's silly.  Read/write get passed the file descriptor,
and it makes a lot of sense, if the filesystem has stateful opens.
Similarly for any fs operation that gets a file descriptor, it makes
sense to pass the relevant open file down into the filesystem.
If you look carefully, the ftrunacate() already does this, becuse
without that it's impossible to implement correct semantics in the
filesystem in some cases.
For other operations it's not impossible, but it would mean more hacks
in the filesystem itself (such as sillyrenaming) that are entirely
unneeded if the file info is available.
I agree, that the xattr API is quite ugly already, but adding one more
argument won't make it all that much worse.
