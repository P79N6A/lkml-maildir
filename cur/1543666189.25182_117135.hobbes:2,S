In 2.3 and beyond (current is 2.3.2 I think), there are a few 2.5
changes.  Nothing required, though.
The biggest is NPTL, which takes advantage of all the threading stuff.
There is also sysenter support.
And support for new 2.5 system calls - most, but not all, of them are
there.  I know the affinity calls are.  And the new posix_fadvise().

libc-alpha is the public glibc list.  It is hosted at
sources.redhat.com.
