Not his politics. These no-competition clauses quickly extend to where
you don't expect them, unintentionally.

I'd translate it to the old "have a GP/BSD-licensed tool to just check
out the stuff" (and leave modifications to some party that is entitled

that's for local uncompressed repositories only.
