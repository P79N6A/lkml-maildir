FIrst off, so we're all clear, the problem with vt/X switching was definitely a
pm2fb bug exposed by chages in fbcon, and is definitely fixed by the above
patch. Please apply.
As to Guennadi's problem with colours and images, I've been trying to
reproduce locally without success, hence silence. My pm2fb-on-Sparc
correspondent hasn't seen this either, and I've had no other reports.
I have one possible clue, which I'll pursue with Guennadi off-list.
