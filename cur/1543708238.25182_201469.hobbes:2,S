Here is a partial tree for the first tree (nearly identical entries from 
the middle trimmed):
/sys/class/scsi_tape/
|-- st0m0
|   |-- default_blksize
|   |-- default_compression
|   |-- default_density
|   |-- defined
|   |-- dev
|   |-- device -> 
../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:01.1/host1/1:0:5:0
|   `-- driver -> ../../../bus/scsi/drivers/st
|-- st0m0n
|   |-- default_blksize
|   |-- default_compression
|   |-- default_density
|   |-- defined
|   |-- dev
|   |-- device -> 
../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:01.1/host1/1:0:5:0

The link is from the SCSI device to one of the scsi_tape directories:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:01.1/host1/1:0:5:0
|-- delete
|-- detach_state
|-- device_blocked
|-- generic -> ../../../../../../class/scsi_generic/sg1
|-- model
|-- online
|-- power
|   `-- state
|-- queue_depth
|-- rescan
|-- rev
|-- scsi_level
|-- tape -> ../../../../../../class/scsi_tape/st0m0
|-- type
`-- vendor
The idea is to be able to follow the links from a generic scsi device to 
the tape device. The link 'generic' created by sg enables associating a 
tape with the corresponding sg device.

Thanks for the review.
