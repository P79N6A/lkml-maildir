Well - it works.
I have both patches runnig here (installed the xfs-patches and after 
that the preempt-2.4.14-2 - only 2 or 3 minor offsets while patching).
System "feels" fluid now - but my UT crashes hard while using that 
kernel :( Seems it doesn't like it. But while normal work no problems 
detected until now...
ciao
