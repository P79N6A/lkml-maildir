yeap it is an old redhat (5.0)
I reply it to all of you because the source of the message is the fact that
the kernel does not recognize the 10/100VG boards and I compiled the support
for the ether boards directly into the kernel, so, I suppose it is a 2.0.36
problem
i'll try a 2.2 as soon as it compiles (DX266 :-) )
