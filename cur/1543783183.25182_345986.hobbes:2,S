I performed the following tests with this command:
    dd if=/dev/sd?1 of=/dev/null bs=256k count=78125
Single disk tests:
    /dev/sdc1 74.954715 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 74.973417 MB/s
Following disks in parallel:
    2 disks on same channel
    /dev/sdc1 75.034191 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 74.984643 MB/s
    3 disks on same channel
    /dev/sdc1 75.027850 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 74.976583 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 75.278276 MB/s
    4 disks on same channel
    /dev/sdc1 58.343166 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 62.993059 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 66.940569 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 70.986072 MB/s
    2 disks on different channels
    /dev/sdc1 74.954715 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 74.973417 MB/s
    4 disks on different channels
    /dev/sdc1 74.959030 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 74.877703 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 75.009697 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 75.028138 MB/s
    6 disks on different channels
    /dev/sdc1 49.640743 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 55.935419 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 58.795241 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 50.280864 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 54.210705 MB/s
    /dev/sdi1 59.413176 MB/s
So this looks different from writting, only as of four disks does the
performance begin to drop.
I just noticed, did you want me to do these test with the oread program?
Thanks,
Holger
