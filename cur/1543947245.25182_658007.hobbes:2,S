My concern with all the points you mentioned is that this solution might need to
change again, depending on the factors you've mentioned. vmalloc() is good and
straightforward, but it has these dependencies which could call for another
rewrite of the code.

vmalloc_node() would need to work much the same way as mem_map does. I am
tempted to try the mem_map and radix tree approaches. I think KAMEZAWA is
already working and has a first draft of the radix tree changes ready.
