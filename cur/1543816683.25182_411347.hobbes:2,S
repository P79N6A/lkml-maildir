what is the purpose of this patch?  what bug is it solving?  Are we
trying to achieve some goal?  A comment at the very least is
necessary.  I don't like changing timing stuff unless we have some
clear reason.  In fact I sent a patch a while back to a guy who was
complaining about latency in a -RT kernel with e100 and he said this
kind of change made things worse: see the end of:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113808831932769&w=2
The problem in this case is the mii library calling back into our
mdio_read.  eepro100's mdio read hard spins with no delay besides the
ioread32 delay created by reading from an i/o port.  This could
explain the glitching in an RT kernel.
Is this the kind of problem this patch tries to solve?
Thanks,
  Jesse
