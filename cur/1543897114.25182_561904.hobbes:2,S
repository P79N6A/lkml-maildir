On what CPU?  The effect of different optimisations varies
hugely between different CPUs (and architectures).

-Os is "as fast as you can without bloating the code size",
so that is the expected result for CPUs that don't need
special hand-holding around certain performance pitfalls.

Well you better report those!  <

There are much better ways to achieve that.
