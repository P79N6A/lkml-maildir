well NO_HZ as is is incompatible with any machine which has support for
the C3 state (at least if they have an Intel CPU) since the local apic
timer just plain stops in C3 unfortunately.
We really need to think about using HPET for this, and potentially on a
single socket system, not do per core timer queues but just 1 global
timer queue.
