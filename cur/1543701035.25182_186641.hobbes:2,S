   The DPT I2O driver was never converted to the new driver model.  The 
driver from what I can see is a mess.  It doesn't even compile in 2.4 
for a number of archs like amd64.
   A while back  a bunch of people (including myself) raised the concern 
through various channels with adaptec.  In theroy someone at adaptec is 
working on it, but there was not an ETA.
