I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like the PF_SYNCWRITE process flag
should be set on the nfsd's while they're doing that, which doesn't
seem to be happening atm.  Looks like a couple of the IO schedulers
will make use of that knowledge now.  All the more reason for a VFS
helper here I guess. ;)
cheers.
