That's due to the original BSD networking code, that believed 'all the world's
a vax' (which has now been replaced by 'all the world's an x86').  I believe
that has been cleaned up.

No, the ISO standard mandates that char be at least 8 bits, short and int be at
least 16 bits, and long be at least 32 bits.  Additionally each of the types
bit size must be a multiple of the char bit size (ie, outlawing 7 or 8 bit
chars on PDP-10 systems, which were used in some cases).  Additionally,
positive integers must be represented internally as binary, but one's
complement and sign magnitude are allowed for signed integer representations
(for those of you who slept through your computer architecture classes, two's
complement is the normal representation these days, but some of the computers
first designed in the 60's used one's complement and signed magnitude).
Tieing in another thread, there is no guarantee in the current standard that
there be an integer large enough to hold a pointer.  The PR1ME computers, and
other word oriented machines typically had char * pointers larger than a long.
BTW, I've written a C compiler for a machine that had different pointer formats
for char/void pointers and for other pointers.  Great fun when dealing with
typical user code :-(
