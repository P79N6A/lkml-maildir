not really. In many ways it's the same space.

the spec simply doesn't allow it. Sure it may work on your machine today,
but that doesn't make it a good idea ;)

it's unlikely to be many machines though.

I'm all in favor of a more detailed test; just we HAVE to have a test
for this since it's simply broken too often. What the test needs to do
is check if the MCFG entry actually points to a working mmconfig area,
so 1) that it actually points to an mmconfig area and not to garbage, and 2)
that accesses to it actually work ;)
the current approach doesn't test 2) realistically, only 1), but if you weaken
the 1) test as you propose you really ought to substitute it with a 2) test...
