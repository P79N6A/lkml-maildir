Hmm, so you're predicting problems if user space includes something
that uses uint32_t ? Wouldn't either of these work (descriptive file
names for clarity):
 1) include/linux-user/foo.h:
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <linux-kernel-and-user-common/foo.h>
    include/linux/foo.h:
    #include <linux/stdint.h>
    #include <linux-kernel-and-user-common/foo.h>
    (And document that anything under linux-user may pull in a
    certain set of standard headers, such as stdint.h, maybe
    sys/types.h, etc.)
 2) include/linux-user/foo.h:
    #ifndef __KERNEL__
    #include <stdint.h>
    #else
    #include <linux/stdint.h>  /* if we want this */
    #endif
    ...
    foo stuff (or some include)
    ...
    Idem. (Sort of the opposite of what we have today.)
 3) just require that some stdint.h has been included before
    including linux-user/foo.h
For user space that absolutely insists on doing its own uint32_t,
a refined variant of case 3 (i.e. detailing of what exactly is
expected to be defined) or, in case 1, direct use of
linux-kernel-and-user-common/foo.h along with the definition from
case 3 should work.
There are other cases where a header file may pull in other
definitions, e.g. for fcntl.h, POSIX decrees
| Inclusion of the <fcntl.h> header may also make visible all
| symbols from <sys/stat.h> and <unistd.h>.
So the semantics of for cases 1 and 2 would be consistent with
current POSIX practice.
What am I missing ?
