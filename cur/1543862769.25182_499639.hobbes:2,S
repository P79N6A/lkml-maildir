There can be always NUMA policy without cpusets for once.

Ok.

Yes we should actually. Every node should be able to supply
memory (unless extreme circumstances like mlock) and that much dirty 
memory on a node will make that hard.

No actually people are fairly unhappy when one node is filled with 
file data and then they don't get local memory from it anymore.
I get regular complaints about that for Opteron.
Dirty limit wouldn't be a full solution, but a good step.

That is another concern. I haven't checked recently, but it used
to be fairly simple to put a system to its knees by oversubscribing
a single node with a strict memory policy. Fixing that would be good.
