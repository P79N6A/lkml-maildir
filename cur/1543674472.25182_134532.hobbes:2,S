_Do_ look it up.  Neither ->unlink() nor ->rename() need to do anything with
any sort of dentry locking or modifications.
Illustrates the point rather nicely, doesn't it?  What was that about

Unfortunately, that group is nowhere near that select - look up the
Sturgeon's Law somewhere.  90% of anything and all such...
