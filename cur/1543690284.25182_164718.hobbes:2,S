I've run some tests on a 4p P4 HT machine.  Some heavy futex using
benchmark code runs about 6% faster with the patch.  So, despite the
reduced time the futex lock is actually taken after Jamie's patch the
separate locks still add benefits.
Plus, currently we do not allocate locks so that the futexes fall in
different buckets.  To some extend this is possible and would be a
possible optimization if this patch goes in.
