I can generate the error using the following procedure:
1. Boot in 2.6.10. Remove /etc/asound.conf and store the current mixer
settings.
2. Boot in 2.6.11 and let alsactl restore the mixer.
Provided the machine is powered down between each attempt this gives the
same result. 'Headphone Jack Sense' ends up not muted (which means that
the built-in speakers are dead).
I fail to find where FC saves/restores the mixer settings so I can't
test without it. There are commands in modprobe.conf but asound.conf
still gets updated when I remove these lines. So there must be some more
place[s] where alsactl gets called.
