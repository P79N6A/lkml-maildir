Yes, if you change the normal io paths to properly support playing 
vmsplice games ( which have a number of corner cases ) to get the zero 
copy, and support madvise() and O_SYNC to control caching behavior, and 
fix all the error handling corner cases, then you may be able to do away 
with O_DIRECT.
I believe that doing all that will be much more complex than O_DIRECT 
however.
