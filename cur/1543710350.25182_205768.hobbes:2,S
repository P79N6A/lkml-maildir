Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2004-03-11 release of hotplug scripts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2004_03_11.tar.gz
or for those who like bz2 packages:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2004_03_11.tar.bz2
This is a snapshot of the recent development in the scripts, and should
be used by anyone who has reported a bug or sent me a patch against the
last release, to check if your fix is in or not.
If I have missed any changes, please let me know and send the patch to
me and the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list.  I'll collect them all and
make a "official" release afterwards.
Sorry for delaying so long since the last hotplug release.
A changelog of all the stuff in this release is below.
thanks,
greg k-h

        - 2004_03_11 release
        - From Dmitry Torokhov <dtor_core@ameritech.net>:
                add evbug to the blacklist of modules
        - From Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>:
                We should mention the DEVPATH in the hotplug man page too,
                as someone missed it and got confused.
        - 5 patches from Marco d'Itri <md@Linux.IT>:
                - 000_small_fixes: fixed some small bugs.
                - 001_no_bashisms: removed bashisms from all scripts.
                - 003_no_useless_includes: removed some unused code.
                - 004_2.6_pci_synthesis: added sysfs support to pci.rc,
                  enabling boot time events synthesis on lacking the
                  pcimodules program.
                - 004_2.6_usb_sysfs: improved sysfs support in the USB
                  scripts. Please review the changes marked with the FIXME
                  comment: this works on my system and others, but I'm not
                  sure that it's the proper way.

        - scsi.agent waits for /sys$DEVPATH/type to appear before
          modprobing higher level drivers.  Patch from Patrick
          Mansfield <patmans@us.ibm.com>
