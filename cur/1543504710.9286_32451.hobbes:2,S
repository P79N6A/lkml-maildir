The big problem I have with NASM is the license, if it hasn't been
updated lately there is still a problem with it being shipped with a
distribution such as RedHat:
    Charging a fee for the Software is prohibited, although a fee 
    may be charged for the act of transferring a copy, and you can 
    offer warranty protection and charge a fee for that.
Other than that, for me the as86/ld86 combo works and the code is
almost never changed, adding a dependency on a new tool (i.e. NASM or
a newer binutils) seems like a lot of trouble for almost no gain.
BTW, yes, I have been hacking the as86 sources, porting the Linux-2.0
kernel to an embedded 486 so I am aware that the as86 code is kind
of brittle and the error/warning messages leave a _lot_ to be desired,
but still, it's such a small amount of code that I can live with it.
