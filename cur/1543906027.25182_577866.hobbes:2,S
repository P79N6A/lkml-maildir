Yeah please do a fixup for the boot wrapper.
Or, if you have trouble, go into the firmware and type "nvedit", add
these lines;
" /isa/8042" find-device
" 8042" encode-string device-type
(then ctrl-c to exit and nvstore to run it on next reboot. Try it without
the patch first, on the firmware console, just to be sure I got it right,
because I can't test it here)
You don't need to patch Linux at all. In fact for silly things like this
I would recommend against it :)
