Interesting, will try. I've a whole bunch of more pressing problems with
my new baby, though. X is completely broken, no matter which X modelines
I configure I get nothing but sizzle on the screen, it seems that the
mode setup for the LVDS with the 9600 Mobility is bork.
The clock scaling of the CPU also doesn't work; interestingly at 867 MHz
it's not much faster the my old Ti PB 500 in dnetc RC-5 though the
overall system has a lot faster design.
Also I cannot boot it automatically from network because holding down N
at bootup will not pick up a DHCP address, so I have to type quite a bit
in OF. :(
If you need any info about the system I'd be glad to help you out.
