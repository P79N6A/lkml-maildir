Subject: [2.4] current bk ipmi build fix

Hello!
   Not that I really have the hardware, but it breaks my "allyesconfig" build.
   So here is this compile fix for ipmi driver in current 2.4 bk tree.
   (I see that Alan have some similarly named fix in his tree and
    actually there is whole new version of the driver on the net somewhere,
    but it is unclear when it is planned to be pushed to 2.4 tree,
    so I'd better post this now ;) ).
Bye,
    Oleg
