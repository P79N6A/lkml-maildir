That's because no assembly code in x86-64 knows anything about frame pointers.
You will always get truncated traces if anything assembler is in trace.
That's just dangerous.

Some hack in (3) would be probably best, otherwise (1).
At some point I hope we can get the dwarf2 unwinder back, then
the problem should be also solved. But then you would need to force
the dwarf2 unwinder with fault injection on, but that shouldn't
be a problem.
