Hi all,
I'm not sure how many are aware that I keep current CD-ROM
patches at 
http://www.kernel.dk
? Enough plugging...  The
current patch against 2.3.18 contains: 
- Partition based multisession mounting. For instance,
  mount /dev/hdc2 /mnt/cdrom would mount the second
  session on the CD. Two notes - a) it only works on
  ATAPI drives, since SCSI drives use minors differently...
  b) mounting /dev/hdc2 overrides a specified session=
  option to mount.
- Uniform CD Changer support. This was largely done by
  Richard Sharman and tested by Erik Andersen (a bit,
  at least!). Now both ATAPI and SCSI changers should
  work. This also gets rid of the awful CONFIG_BLK_
  DEV_IDECD config option.
- Video CD / CDi fixes.
- Fixes a couple of leaks in cdrom.c
- The obligatory cleanups. Note that pcd.c is untested,
  Grant is looking into what needs to be done to get this
  in complete working order.
