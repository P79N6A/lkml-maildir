1) How will this work in the face of CONFIG options that change the
list of symbols present in your kernel?  E.g. my hot oprofile list
might well contain a bunch of symbols from my NIC driver and whatever
filesystem I'm pounding on.
2) If you add enough lists from enough people, perhaps you'll get enough
coverage of the kernel with all their different workloads, that you'll have
too much to fit into the 2M page.

single mapping, so we don't have any TLB misses at all :)
