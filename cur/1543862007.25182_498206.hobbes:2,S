on file close reiserfs tries to "pack" content of last incomplete page of file into metadata blocks.
It should not if that page is still mapped somewhere. 
It does not actually truncate, it calls the same function which does truncate, but file size does not change.
Please consider the below patch.
From: Vladimir Saveliev <vs@namesys.com>
This patch fixes a confusion reiserfs has for a long time.
On release file operation reiserfs used to try to pack file data stored in last incomplete page of some files
into metadata blocks. After packing the page got cleared with clear_page_dirty.
It did not take into account that the page may be mmaped into
other process's address space. Recent replacement for clear_page_dirty cancel_dirty_page found the confusion
with sanity check that page has to be not mapped.
The patch fixes the confusion by making reiserfs to avoid tail packing if an inode was ever mmapped.
reiserfs_mmap and reiserfs_file_release are serialized with mutex in reiserfs specific inode.
reiserfs_mmap locks the mutex and sets a bit in reiserfs specific inode flags.
reiserfs_file_release checks the bit having the mutex locked. If bit is set - tail packing is avoided.
This eliminates a possibility that mmapped page gets cancel_page_dirty-ed.
