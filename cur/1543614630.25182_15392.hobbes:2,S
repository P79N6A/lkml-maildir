Merging is much easier.
Tracking of patches is much easier.
Access control is much easier.
Etc.

Actually, BK can definitely do that.  In fact, that's basically exactly what
we have on the hosting service for the PPC tree.  There are a list of people
who are administrators, a list of committers, as well as read only access.
The admins are also committers if they want to be, the admins also get to
control who is and is not a committer.
And you dream up as complicated an access control model as you want.  We
can do pretty much any model you can describe.  Try me, describe a work
flow that you think would be useful, I'll write up how to do it and stick
it on a web page and you can throw stones at it and see if it breaks.
