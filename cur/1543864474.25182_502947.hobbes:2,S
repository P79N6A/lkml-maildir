Subject: slow module build--what am I doing wrong?

When I modify a source file or two that belong to a particular
module, and then rebuild just that module with "make
dir1/dir/module.ko" (e.g.), the build system spends a couple of
minutes grinding away on "MODPOST" operations.  Am I doing
something wrong?  Is there a way to avoid this?  It slows down my
build-and-test cycle quite a bit.
Thanks!
