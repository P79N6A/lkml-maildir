Subject: [BUG] reiserfs/super.c commit breaks boot process in stable and HEAD

Hi,
I'm observing an instant reboot while booting current stable or HEAD
kernels since a recent ReiserFS commit. Details and temporary fix below.
Kind regards,
 Horst Schirmeier
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
reiserfs change leads to instant reboot while in boot process
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
The mainline commit d35c602870ece3166cff3d25fbc687a7f707acf3
("[PATCH] Someone broke reiserfs v3 mount options and this fixes it")
breaks the boot process for me and leads to an instant reboot.
Unfortunately this commit was backported to Greg KH's stable tree
(d1753372c3c16c9cfb88bed7f0278091187053f3), so 2.6.15.2 and .3 show the
same behaviour.
Reverting this commit (though it looks sane at first glance) makes both
the stable and HEAD kernels boot again.
The "Warning: unable to open an initial console." message is emitted
after sys_open((const char __user *) "/dev/console", O_RDWR, 0)) in
init/main.c fails; adding some debugging code revealed that sys_open
actually returns -13 as an error code, which I can't make very much of.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
instant reboot, reiserfs, fs/reiserfs/super.c
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.6.16-rc2-gc03296a8-dirty (root@nexus) (gcc version 3.4.4
(Gentoo 3.4.4-r1, ssp-3.4.4-1.0, pie-8.7.8)) #3 PREEMPT Tue Feb 7
15:15:56 CET 2006
(-dirty is only due to the reverted commit)
[5.] Most recent kernel version which did not have the bug:
2.6.15.1, 2.6.16-rc2
[6.] Output of Oops (copied by hand from analog screenshot)
