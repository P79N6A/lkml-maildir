Yeah, it should not be a big problem.

E.g. RAID stride size, and the max_sectors_kb.
Typically they are power-of-two.

I'm also OK with the scaling up scheme. It's reasonable.

Sadly mmap read-around reuses the same readahead size.
- for read-around, VM_MAX_READAHEAD is the _real_ readahead size
- for readahead, VM_MAX_READAHEAD is the _max_ readahead size
If we simply increasing VM_MAX_READAHEAD, tiny systems can be
immediately hurt by large read-arounds. That's the problem.
