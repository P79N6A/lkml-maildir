No.  The popper (__rwsem_do_wake) runs in the context of up_xxxx(), not
down_xxxx().  Remember: up() may need to wake up several processes if there's
a batch of readers at the front of the queue.
Remember also: rwsems, unlike mutexes, are completely fair.

Currently interruptible rwsems are not available, but that may change, and
whilst I agree making it slower probably isn't a problem, it's still a point
that has to be considered.
