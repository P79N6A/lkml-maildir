When you get a device handle (ie pointer to a device) the reference count
is also bumped since this is now running without a single lock. dev_put is
just handing back your reference. Its basically SMP safe garbage collection,
a driver wont evaporate on you.

Whenever you have two paths through your code you don't wish to execute
in parallel - eg updating a table and routing a packet via it

Take a look at the source listed. It normally means you called a routine
when it thinks you should have a lock held.

Take the lock, do all the shutdown then drop it.
