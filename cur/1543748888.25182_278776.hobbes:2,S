Hi
Thanks for your comments and thanks for the patch.  I also received 
reports that the kernel patches didn't build with gcc < 3.  This is 
because I used unamed structures and unions which are not supported by 
gcc < 3.  The "fun" of dealing with all the differing gcc versions in 
use out there :-)  I'll do another release with the code changes.
