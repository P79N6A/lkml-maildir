Ingo, do you plan to maintain the voluntary preempt patch against the
-mm series?  From looking at Andrew's announcement yesterday it looks
like many latency issues fixed in the voluntary preemption patches are
also fixed in -mm, so it seems like the patch would be much smaller. 
One thing that might be useful is breaking out the irq threading code as
a patch against -mm.  Judging from all the -mm latency fixes it seems
like this would work as well as the vanilla kernel+voluntary preempt.
This would also make it easier to identify which are the important
latency fixes from -mm enabling them to be pushed into mainline sooner. 
On some of my tests I got 10-20% better results using vol-preempt+mm vs
vol-preempt+vanilla, it would be nice to identify what changes are
responsible.
