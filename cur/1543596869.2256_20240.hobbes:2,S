A moronic attempt as using this funny qwerty layout thing.  It should
read SW (ServerWorks).
    They must be the Unisys OEM machines.  They are based on some
    crossbar-architecture called CMP that allows logical partioning,
    etc..
Yup, turns out they are.
    I have talked to Unisys engineers on last Cebit who said that the
    NT (now W2k) port required a huge amount of work.  Also I noticed
    that UnixWare^H^H^H^H^HOpenUnix needed work to run on it.
Well, I guess NetBSD is a good candidate, it has a nice portable MM
system, linux might not be so bad either, but without knowledge of how
this works, I am just guessing and probably still talking shit.
