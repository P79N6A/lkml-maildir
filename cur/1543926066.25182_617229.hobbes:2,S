You missed the following in my email:
"we slowly scare them away due to the many bug reports without any 
 reaction."
The problem is that bug reports take time. If you go away from easy 
things like compile errors then even things like describing what does
no longer work, ideally producing a scenario where you can reproduce it 
and verifying whether it was present in previous kernels can easily take 
many hours that are spent before the initial bug report.
If the bug report then gets ignored we discourage the person who sent 
the bug report to do any work related to the kernel again.
