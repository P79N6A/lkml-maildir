Hello all!
I was just wondering, do you have to do something magical to get the 2.5
series booting, or is it just my debian thats fubar? :)
I've tried 2.5.66 and 2.5.67 and they both halt on the initial line of
booting - 'Booting Linux, Uncompressing something...' or something like
that.
My system is Debian SID
Athlon 2800+
1gb mem and so forth and so forth although that shouldn't really matter
that much
Ohhh, and another question - Is it generally a good idea to use
make-kpkg to compile the 2.5 series?
