Oh, cool.  Perhaps the server should send these automatically, when
I/O operations are taking a little bit too long?

Yes, it often is.  I seek 32k reads taking several seconds, when the
disk is busy with other tasks.

Yes, exactly.  Though I saw the tail due to normal disk seek + access
time is quite significant, compared with cached access time.

That would be a big improvement.  I take it you have effectively
clamped the retransmit time at a minimum of 1/10 second, then?  (I
didn't understand what you meant earlier).
Last time I used a soft mount, I was seeing the first retransmit after
some time smaller than a millisecond.  (I don't remember, but 0.1ms
sounds about right).  If that is the retransmit time, then retrans=6
won't be enough - retrans=16 would be needed.  I don't think a good
correct retrans=xxx setting should depend on the network like that.
Setting a minimum retransmit time is one way to fix that.
