Lots of BIOSes (a million monkeys bashing on typewriters will write
something that passes some BIOS vendor QA in about 2 seconds) illegally
assume that 0040: points at the BIOS data segment 0040 when making APM32

corrected.

PnPBIOS has to rewrite segments as it goes for data passing. It doesnt
really matter where you stuff them though.
