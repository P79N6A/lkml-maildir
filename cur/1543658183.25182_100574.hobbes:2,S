The declaration of `module_frob_arch_sections' in moduleloader.h (and
the definitions in most of the module.c files) are inconsistent with the
definition in the PPC's module.c -- in the latter the first two
arguments are not declared `const', whereas everyplace else they are.
I copied the PPC version of module_frob_arch_sections for the v850, and
couldn't compile without changing the type-signature to match.  Making
all args const to agree with the declaration results in these warnings:
   arch/v850/kernel/module.c: In function `module_frob_arch_sections':
   arch/v850/kernel/module.c:124: warning: assignment of read-only member `sh_size'arch/v850/kernel/module.c:126: warning: assignment of read-only member `sh_size'
Since the purpose of module_frob_arch_sections is to frob, perhaps it
makes sense to have the frobable arguments be non-const (in this case
only sechdrs needs it, I guess)... :-)
