The main linux-mips git tree is derived of Linus' kernel.org tree and
I usually update it daily.  Patch scheduled for the next kernel release or
later go into a special tree from which akpm pulls.  For significant
patch submissions that means patches should be generated either against
the linux-queue tree from linux-mips.org (which only contains the MIPS
specific stuff) or possibly akpm's -mm tree.
