Interesting patch. Do seekdir and telldir still work? I think you must 
detect lseek calls and invalidate the cookie - either by hooking lseek 
or by looking at f_version.
I think my solution for proc_pid_readdir() is better: You must fall back 
to the old algorithm if the pid number stored in f_private got invalid 
between two syscalls. I've modified the hash table slightly and search 
for the next pid value directly, which works even if the current 
position disappeared.
