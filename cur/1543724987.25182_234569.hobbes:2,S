I guess I don't understand then, from my looking over it I didn't see
where the time_interpolator_get_offset() is scaled back when NTP is
slewing the clock. It seems that while the time-interpolator code does
keep time from going backwards, it also inadvertently ends up
compensating for NTP slow down. Thus the slewing is not visible to
userspace. 
In order for this to happen, time_interpolator_get_offset() would need
to be scaled or capped as to that it would not return more then the
length of the *NTP adjusted tick* during an actual tick interval.
I may be missing something, so please let me know if I'm wrong.
thanks
