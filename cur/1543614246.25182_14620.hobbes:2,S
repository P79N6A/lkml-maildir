Hi,
I am also looking for stuff NBD related, my first intention is studying 
on nfsswap, but I've heard NBD is more efficient, is there any port of 
nbd swap in the recent 2.4.1x kernels?  I may do an up port is the code 
is old, but hopefully something in 2.4 not 2.0 and 2.2 . Thanks.
regards,
David
