What I'd really like to see:
 - get rid of __NO_VERSION__ entirely
 - get rid of the silly EXPORT_SYMTAB requirements entirely.
 - every single file should be able to do EXPORT(), and let's use
   something like "make checkconfig" to make sure that they are correctly
   marked in the makefiles as requireing the module treatment, instead of
   the current EXPORT_SYMTAB thing that causes errors if you want to make
   individual .s or .o files with "make drivers/xxxx/yyyy.s"
The versioning flags could equally easily be handled by a very simple
macro, so that an independent module would usually end with the magic
incantation
	module_version();
	module_init(init_xxxx);
	module_exit(exit_xxxx);
and it would magically do the right thing in all cases (and a
non-independent object file that gets linked into a bigger module would
just not have these lines - no need for the __NO_VERSION__ stuff).
With those two cleanups, a module would look very clean indeed. Just
include <linux/module.h> and don't worry about things..
