well, if you _really_ want people who are interested in this to do weekly 
"why isn't it merged yet you $%#$%# developers" threads that can be 
arranged.
the people who want this have been trying to be patient and let the system 
work. if it takes people being pests to get something implemented it can 
be done, but I don't think other people on the list will appriciate this.

the kernel, no matter what?
