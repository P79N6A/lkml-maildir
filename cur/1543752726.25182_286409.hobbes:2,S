This is just a hack. Realtime scheduling is pretty rigidly specified,
and we satisfy that. Thus it is useful for systems that need to make
use of it. The way SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduling is specified is
inherently insecure/incompatible with a multi user machine; I don't
understand why people are getting heated with this debate. You literally
can't run more than one realtime system on the same CPU(s) if they don't
have a knowledge of one another.
SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR are definitely privileged operations and you
can't really change them without making them useless to legitimate
users, I think.
