Stuff shows up in /sys whether or not Linux has a driver loaded for it.
ls -l /sys/bus/*/devices
Hotplug insertion events are for when the _device_ shows up, not for when the 
driver is loaded.

I think it was a polite way of saying "udev doesn't suck, have unfixable 
races, randomly crash your system..."

On an unrelated note, the proposed file format for busybox's mdev looks 
something like:
hd[a-z]  0:3 700
hd[a-z][0-9]* 0:3 740
.* 0:0 700
There's a little more to it than that, but really, specifying ownership and 
permissions is all we _really_ care about.  (We're not trying to obsolete 
udev.)
The point is, 90% of the complexity of udev is optional.  This _can_ be a lot 
simpler if you're not trying to tackle strange persistent naming issues 
resulting in dynamically generated symlinks, and similar fun.  (Which we may 
add the ability to do as compile-time config options later, but perhaps not 
until somebody actually misses them...)
We really don't forsee having to update mdev for deal with new kernel 
versions...  ever, if we can help it.
And a dynamic module loader hanging off of /sbin/hotplug is probably 
(conceptually) a different tool from mdev...
