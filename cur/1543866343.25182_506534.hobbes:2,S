Why can't I build a running Kernel?
I have in the past, but since some time in the 2.6.19 series,
I have got the following series of errors. 
Same thing now with 2.6.20.
I build with:
    make xconfig
changing only the Processor type to Pentium4,
then I
    make bzImage
    make modules
    make modules_install
    make install
Fine everything builds, no errors.
I then try booting, and I get 4 or 5 lines and then
    Unable to access resume device (/dev/sda5)
    mount: could not find filesystem '/dev/root'
    < 4 more lines with setuproot and switchroot >
and then
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to kill init!
Sigh.
What has changed, what do I need to do to get this thing to boot?
