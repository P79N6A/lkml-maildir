In some real sense, the code is perfect documentation. It _is_ complete,
accurate, and uptodate. The problem we have is that it's sometimes not
lucid. Documentation isn't the fix - documentation isn't necessarily any
more clear and doesn't really address the problem. The fix is making the
code more readable, either through restructuring, rewriting, or comments.
You'll note that Linus loves to get 'cleanups'. If the goal is code that
people understand, write understandable code. Code is the soul of a
project, everything else is dead weight.

I don't think it's the goal either, but it is a major side-effect.

The basic level of knowledge stuff can already be bought at your book
store. Linux Kernel Internals, Linux Device Drivers, Design of The Unix
Operating System, etc.

They already have inertia in the form of the work it takes to fix code
that breaks when an interface changes. Why add to that? 
Obviously, external interfaces (syscalls, ioctls, /proc) are a different
story. But what we're arguing about now is the internals. Or should the
whole underside of the kernel that modules talk to be declared an external
interface and written in stone? Next you'll want binary compatibility and
we'll be one short step away from having a microkernel.

This is a straightforward consequence of the investment in documentation.
"Hey, I just wrote this nifty new subsystem and all these docs. Oh look,
there's a nifty way I could improve it by doing <foo> everywhere. But then
I'd have to change the docs. Hell with it."

Umm, yes. Unreadable code is hard to maintain. Documented unreadable code
is not much better - you still have to read the code to fix it and maybe
just to use it.  Systematically documenting everything with man pages,
etc., including the readable code (which a lot of the kernel is, happily),
is a step in the wrong direction. Effort is better spent on making the
code comprehensible.

So next time you spend a couple hours trying to understand something, take
a few notes. Put them inline. Put them in Documentation/. Make a few
simplifying changes. If you see a better way to do it, do it.
