Hi Dimitri,
  I have observed similar problems on my opensuse 11.0 box (2.6.25
based) when doing kernel builds.  Often times other apps will get
starved (like firefox, etc).  I was talking to peterz about it and he
pointed me at a commit that went into 28-rcx that fixes this (the sha
escapes me at the moment).  I've been meaning to pull the patch into our
2.6.25 and 2.6.27 trees to verify if it fixes it, but I have fairly high
confidence it will.  Perhaps Peter can point you at the same patch and
you can give it a whirl.  For the time being, can you see if 28 is fixed?
