Ever tried to find the attached devices with rescan-scsi-bus.sh [1]?

Could you try with the latest 2.4.19pre tree, please? I remember some 
scsi related fixes from Alan and some other which went into that tree. 
Besides that the 2.4.18 is _really_ old with regard to certain subsystems.

I reckon some sbp2 problem together with the currect scsi interface. If 
you can, you should try it with a 2.4.19pre tree even if it is simply to 
show people that something is still heavily broken and to have a decent 
starting point for debugging purposes.

Always enable SysRq for such test cases, so you can at least emergency 
sync and remount,ro.

I don't know either, we might also need an ieee1394 specialist to solve 
that problem, but only after you tested it with a more recent kernel 
tree ;).
