Hi Suresh,
   Unfortunately, this patch will introduce its own set of bugs. 
However, your analysis was spot-on.  I think I see the problem now.  It 
was introduced when I put a hack in to "fix" s2ram problems in -mm as a 
result of the new root-domain logic.  I think the following patch will 
fix both issues:
(I verified that I could take a cpu offline/online, but I don't have an
s2ram compatible machine handy.  Andrew, I believe you could reproduce
the s2ram problem a few months ago when that issue popped up.  So if you
could, please verify that s2ram also works with this patch applied, in
addition to the hotplug problem.
Regards,
-Greg
-------------------------------------------------
adjust root-domain->online span in response to hotplug event
We currently set the root-domain online span automatically when the domain
is added to the cpu if the cpu is already a member of cpu_online_map.
This was done as a hack/bug-fix for s2ram, but it also causes a problem
with hotplug CPU_DOWN transitioning.  The right way to fix the original
problem is to actually respond to CPU_UP events, instead of CPU_ONLINE,
which is already too late.
