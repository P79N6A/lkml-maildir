Perhaps I'm missing something, but this seems a little odd.
If I understand correctly: with the stated goal of addressing cronyism, a 
mechanism is implemented where only people who are selected by a committee 
or who pay are able to vote, in an election for candidates who only 
represent themselves, and where the vast majority of the community is 
excluded from voting.
The TAB is described on the LF site as:
 "The Technical Advisory Board (TAB) provides the Linux kernel community a 
  direct voice into The Linux Foundation's activities..."
which certainly suggests to me a representative role on behalf of the 
community.
