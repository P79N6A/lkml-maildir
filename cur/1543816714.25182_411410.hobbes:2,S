Hi,
Hmm might even do that, but apart from it not being just a redhat/fedora
issue, I replaced the fedora with gentoo and I wouldn't replace it with
fedora again for paying for redhat support, with no guarantee that this
would help.
Though if there was one that it would make the world a better place, so
to speak, it maybe consider it.
Anyway thanks for the quick reply.
Cheers,
Friedrich Göpel
