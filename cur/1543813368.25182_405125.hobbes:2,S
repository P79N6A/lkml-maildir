mine did the same exact thing on test 2., hung at cfq scheduler, but
this is on a Abit KU8 motherboard with a sempron 64 processor, and it
did it on every distro using a 2.6.15 kernel that I tried, yet 2.6.14
and below were fine, I think there is a problem with the 2.6.15 series
of kernel rather than a media issue, because when gentoo moved to
2.6.15, it stopped on cfq and that was an install over a year old, not
coming off the cd, plus thier new installer,,,, based on .*.15 kerel
wont start for me either, stopping at cfq or right after "loading
kernel....done"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Try these boot options at startup:
noapic acpi=off nofb
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It Worked!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It stops right at:
"io scheduler cfq registered".
opensuse 10 has been giving me a similar problem
And for details, this was an x86_64 version on a abit KU8 motherboard
(died two weeks after I got it) using an AMD 64 3700.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am having the same issue with my ku8 board w/3700amd64, possible
connection? it is giving me the same freezup at cfq scheduler, and it
started when I upgraded to 2.6.15 in core 4/ and on the dvd iso of fc5
test 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I get exactly the same problem. I'm using a shuttle stg205 with ati 2000
xpress chipset and AMD 64 3200. I have had this problem ever since the
2.6.15 kernels.
