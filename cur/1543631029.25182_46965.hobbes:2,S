I have never been able to get ALSA sound working with linux 2.5...
sound works perfectly with the OSS YMFPCI driver enabled, and though I
have been told that the code is the same across both ALSA and OSS I have 
never been able to get ALSA working.
I have unmuted (of course), I have OSS API emulation enabled, I see 
interrupts being fired, apparently the ALSA subsystem can see the card 
(some /proc/asound/* output below).  I have also looked at the settings 
with the ALSA utilities, to double-check that ALSA is in fact 
recognizing... everything YMF744, AC97, etc checks out.
My applications just look like they are playing sound, while only a 
crack comes out of my speakers every once in a while.
Can anyone give me some pointers on how best to debug my problem?  I 
have enabled sound debug and verbose printk in the kernel, but I'm not 
clear on how to use the debug facility.
