As Andre said, do hardware raid.
I just built a box using Mylex DAC AcceleRaid 250 and 3*18GB disk in RAID-5
config
Distro is Debian potato, installing it took some manual fiddling cause older
boot
disks did not support Mylex.  New bootdisks on debian potato 'frozen' distro
should support Mylex DAC.
