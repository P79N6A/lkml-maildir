Greetings;
I've not seen a forcedeth mention go by on this list for quite some
time unless I made it.  It has been quite bulletproof here so I don't 
feel the need for it to remain dependent on the experimental status in 
the main .config.
Hence this patch to remove that requirement from the appropriate 
Kconfig.
