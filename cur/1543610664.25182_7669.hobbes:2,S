I've seen tmpfs problems with 2.4.13+xfs, BTW: As soon as /tmp grows
so large that something has to be swapped out, the machine essentially
locks.  Known problem?
(I'm going to debug this some day and provide more details, but
currently, I'm busy setting up a new machine, and this one can't be
used for such testing any longer.)
