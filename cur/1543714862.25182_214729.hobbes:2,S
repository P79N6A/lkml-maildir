swappiness is pretty arbitrary and unfortunately it means
different things to machines with different sized memory.
Also, once you *have* gone past the reclaim_mapped threshold,
mapped pages aren't really given any preference above
unmapped pages.
I have a small patchset which splits the active list roughly
into mapped and unmapped pages. It might hopefully solve your
problem. Would you give it a try? It is pretty stable here.
