Let me say that this is not a kernel question, but a networking
question, there's no bug, you just have several configuration issues.
However, having been beaten to death and the corpe dragged through the
street, hopefully this might help.
The primary issue is that you are responding to arp and sending out the
wrong MAC address. Don't wait for the router to ask, tell it where the
MAC is for that IP.
  ifconfig eth0 10.8.0.5
  ifconfig eth1 10.8.0.6
  route add www.favorite.com dev eth1
  ping -c2 www.favorite.com
The last two lines are the charm... force the route to any host which
goes via the router to use the "other" IP address. Good, now the router
knows that the IP amd MAC belong together. BTW: if you do an IP takeover
(add an alias IP for a server which fails) you also want to do this, or
the router will send packets to the old MAC until the ARP tables
timeout.
This takes care of incoming connections, the traffic should go to the
right NIC and be sent back through the right NIC. To balance outgoing
connections you can try this instead of defining a default route:
  route add -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.1 dev eth0
  route add -net 0.0.0.1 netmask 0.0.0.1 dev eth1
which used to work to send odd IP destinations out one NIC and even out
the other. If that fails and you care, just get iproute2 and claw your
way up the learning curve.
If you just want to use this for backup, when the machine detects that
the NIC has failed (blessedly unusual, I have 15 dual NIC machines in
four timezones) it can just ifconfig the first down, the second up, and
send out a ping, or better yet use one which allows the MAC address to
be set.
Some of this should get you going, or at least looking in the right
place.
