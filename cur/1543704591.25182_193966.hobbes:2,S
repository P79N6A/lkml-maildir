I think others in the thread have adequately explained the details
you're missing.

That does not change anything at all. The same problems apply and the
same pool of solutions is still available. The easy cases are still easy
and the hard cases are still *really* hard.

Hello? 2.4, etc. support removing modules. Linus was speaking from
experience. One of the reasons module removal is perpetually broken in
subtle ways on those kernels is that it simply does not receive enough
testing. Having some new implementation on 2.6 doesn't change that.

As I pointed out above, it does exist.

Think a little harder and you'll see why that's a ridiculous conclusion.
Hint #1: Distributions. Hint #2: SILO.

No one yet has claimed this is "impossible" to solve, only that it's not
worth solving. Clearly it's important to you, so have at it. Further
discussion of how you "see the answer so clearly" and the rest of us are
"not trying hard enough" should come in the form of patches.
