You have lots of false positives (or something) for arch/powerpc.  Seems
your script picked up #define names and comments that happen to match a
Kconfig variable?  And you have false positives on several CPU
variables, as they are used within Kconfig files themselves to select
different sets of options.
For arch/ppc, the WANT_EARLY_SERIAL stuff was added by Al to fix those
boards that unconditionally called early_serial_setup by selecting
SERIAL_8250 in commit f08243a491f3e21feabbb04476a03fb0cbc975ff.  Al,
couldn't we just select SERIAL_8250 right in the board config
instead?  
Of course, arch/ppc is dying soon-ish anyway so we might not even
bother.
