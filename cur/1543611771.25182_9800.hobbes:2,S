This isn't the complete kernel messages! You've edited it. These first
two lines should be related, yet the devfs entries are different. If I
had the complete kernel messages, I could see what devfs_entry
c14d0a94 is supposed to be. And there might be other clues related to
the dentry values. Also, please changed the second printk() in
devfs_d_delete() to this:
    if (devfs_debug & DEBUG_D_DELETE)
	printk ("%s: d_delete(%s): dentry: %p  inode: %p  devfs_entry: %p pp: %p \"%s\"\n",
		DEVFS_NAME, de->name, dentry, inode, de, de->parent, de->parent->name);
Please, edit nothing. If the output is big, just send it to me so you
don't spam the list.
Also, please send me the output of lsmod prior to the Oops.
