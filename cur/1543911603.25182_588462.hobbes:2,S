FWIW, in the mm kernel, I've actually already removed them when one
configures without capabilities.
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.23-rc3/2.6.23-rc3-mm1/broken-out/v3-file-capabilities-alter-behavior-of-cap_setpcap.patch
Other than writing a custom module, so far as I can tell, there is/was
no way to set them anyway.
I'd obviously prefer to wait for the mm-merge process to complete and
minimize the churn in this area, but I basically agree that the bits as
implemented are pretty useless in their current form. In a per-process
mode (with filesystem capability support) they are much more useful...
Cheers
Andrew
