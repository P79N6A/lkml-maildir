Yeah.  It sure would be fantastic if some ext3 expert could stop this
from happening somehow.  But that hasn't happened in.. uh.. Badari, for
how many years has this been on the radar? :)

Oops.  That's too bad.  So maybe we should fix it by not stomping on
that return code?
	ret2 = do_launder()
	if (ret2 == 0)
		ret2 = invalidate()
	if (ret == 0)
		ret = ret2
I'd be surprised if we ever wanted to mask an -EIO when later pages
laundered successfully.

Yeah.

Well, I like the idea of more intelligently dealing with the known
problem between dio and ext3.  I'm not sure that falling back to
buffered is right.
If dio can tell that it only failed because jbd held the buffer, should
we have waited for the transaction to complete before trying to
invalidate again?
If we could do that, we'd avoid performing the IO twice.

I'm not sure duplicating the invalidation loop into a new function is
the right thing.  Maybe we'd just tweak inode_pages2 to indicate to the
caller the specific failing circumstances somehow.  Maybe.
