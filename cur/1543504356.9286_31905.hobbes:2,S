yep.

those background tasks are _not_ non-essential  (so solution #1 is not;).
they are only non-essential iff other (more important) tasks are running.
these tasks may be so important (or their users think they are;) that
you don't want to spend 5% for the not-so-important tasks.

not an option in a multi user system where different users
run `idle' tasks and more-important tasks.

using a deamon to watch is not an option if your more-important tasks
have pretty short life time, but are started very frequently (or sleep
relatuvely long time pretty often, e.g. in parallel processing).
the deamon would have to check (poll, ugh;) so often that it wasts
(too much) time itself.

not an option (and even worse: CPU and disk space requests are like 
an ideal gas, they will use up all free/new resources;)

the first good one;-))  wish you could tell this our users who complain
about those 5% (it's not me, it's the dear l.user...)

yep:(
