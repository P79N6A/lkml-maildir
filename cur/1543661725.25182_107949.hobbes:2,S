I had a bunch of problems with the in kernel and vendor qlogic drivers
on my ppc64 box. Matt Jacob's driver worked out of the box. Davem
sounded positive last time I asked him about it.
I did a quick forward port to 2.5 a month or two ago, sounds like we
should work to get it in the kernel. There are some rough edges but
Mike kindly offered to lend a hand here.
