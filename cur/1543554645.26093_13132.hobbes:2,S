Nope: /dev/audio, /dev/cdrom, /dev/floppy, fonts, etc.
Also one would want a local window manager for performance,
but this tends to interfere with starting apps on the other
system.

Now we want it distributed, with version control, with
mirroring onto N of M machines and migration toward usage...

It would have been nice to have just put 2 entries right
in the inode years ago. With the KISS method, we'd be using
ACLs right now. Even just a list of UIDs that would share
permission bits with the file's GID would be very useful.
I just want to share a file with one other person!
