No you did not...
{dig, dig, dig}  Ah, here we go:
I stated in the original announcement with message id
<20060803204921.GA10935@kroah.com>:
	He will still be following the same -stable rules that are
	documented in the Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt file,
	but just doing this for the 2.6.16 kernel tree for a much longer
	time than the current stable team is willing to do (we have
	moved on to the 2.6.17 kernel now.)
And I said that based on a message you wrote to stable@kernel.org where
you stated:
	My primary goal is to follow these rules.
	But there will also be cases like "adding a PCI id to a driver"
	that wouldn't fit the wording of the your -stable release rules.
	OTOH, I remember e.g. releases/2.6.12.3/smp-fix-for-6pack.patch
	being added despite me disagreeing with this - and this did
	equally not match the -stable rules.
	Especially if the tree will be accepted and used for a long
	time, there will be a need for moderate hardware updates. But
	2.4 and 2.6 have different rules, people quickly learned that
	-rc is Linus' newspeak for -pre ;-) and similar things, so I
	doubt the confusion will be that big (people will either use the
	current stable kernel or the 2.6.16 branch - and people using
	the latter will know the difference (otherwise they wouldn't use
	an older branch instead of the latest stable kernel)).
Hm, ok, I guess you did say this in the beginning, but only to a small
subset of us.  And I misinterpreted it too in my original announcement.
Ok, I withdraw my objection, only to note that this is going to cause
your tree to diverge even more than expected, which might cause bigger
problems in the end.
good luck,
greg k-h
