Could I get a little more information about this function please.
I've read through the code, and there isn't much in the way of
examples to follow: only reiserfs uses it, only scsi-disk and ide-disk
supports it (I think).
It would seem that this is for write requests where b_end_io has already
been called, indicating that the data is safe, but that maybe the data
isn't really safe after-all, and blk_issue_flush needs to be called.
I would have thought that after b_end_io is called, that data should
be safe anyway.  Not so?
How do you tell a device: it is OK to just leave the data is cache,
I'll call blk_issue_flush when I want it safe.
Is this related to barriers are all??
