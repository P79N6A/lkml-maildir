Never. However, since the time-slice is 'time', the very instant that
the hardware interrupt executes it's "iret", the hardware-timer may
interrupt and the CPU gets taken away from the task.
Suppose that the preemption timer ticked at 1 HZ intervals. Suppose
that an awful interrupt service routine (one that loops inside) took 1
second to be serviced. What would happen if a task was 3/4 of a second
into its time-slice and then a hardware interrupt occurred?
The CPU would be taken away at 3/4 second, given to the bad ISR, then
the CPU would not be returned until (1) the one-second execution time
had occurred, and (2), all other higher priority tasks had gotten their
time-slices. Each of those higher-priority tasks, could further get
interrupted by the rogue ISR. The result may be that you get the CPU
back next Tuesday.

The scheduler does not preempt a task until its time has expired.
However time is a constantly-expiring thing so interrupts can
eat up a processes' time.
The usual way for a process (task) to lose it's allocated CPU time-
slice is to perform some I/O. When waiting for I/O, the kernel may
give the CPU to somebody else.
If, the scheduler worked on task-CPU time, rather than hardware-clock
"wall time", maybe it would be more "fair" during periods of high
interrupt activity. However, since interrupts occur anytime, they
tend to attack all competing processes equally, therefore becoming
"fair" unless it's one task that's generating all that interrupt
activity, like network I/O, or some kinds of screen-interactivity.
