OK, well I've rather lost the plot with all the patches flying around.
I now have one single patch against epoll.c, below.  Please confirm that
this is what was intended.   If not, I'll drop it and let's start again.
From: Davide Libenzi <davidel@xmailserver.org>
The sys_epoll_wait() function was not handling correctly negative timeouts
(besides -1), and like sys_poll(), was comparing millisec to secs in
testing the upper timeout limit.
