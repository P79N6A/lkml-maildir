Consider what happens when the exiting process is scheduled for the
last time (when it is still runnable, not when it has changed its state
to zombie).  The wmb() in __schedule_tail() should make all CPUs see
that has_cpu=1 for this process.  This is before the process becomes a
zombie, so when a process sees that p->state= TASK_ZOMBIE it cannot
have a stale p->has_cpu=0.  I don't see the need for a barrier in this
piece of code.  It appears to me that 
        while (p->has_cpu)
                ;
should be enough.
