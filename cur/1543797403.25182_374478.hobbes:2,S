With the nlkd patches I actually submitted code that does deal with the
calculation when significant amounts of ticks have been missed. However,
this is only part of the problem. What is more important first is for
the resume code to tell the timer interrupt handlers that it shouldn't
consider the last TSC (or other time stamp) value read prior to suspend,
but rather start anew.

It doesn't only change the HPET code, the TSC code was suffering from
overflow problems, too, which the patch also tries to address. I can't,
however, see where or how it would cause softlockup reports. Do the
printed call stacks provide any useful information?

For the simple reason that there is no way to know whether the entire
interconnect from CPU to HPET is (at least) 64 bits wide. At least
theoretically implementations are permitted to use 32-bit components;
the HPET spec specifically warns about that.

What cleanups are you referring to here?
