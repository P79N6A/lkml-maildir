Thanks Keith,
I don't get any errors if I add these lines to my .config
file:
	CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
	CONFIG_SOUND_ACI_MIXER=m
Ruurd, are you maintaining this driver?
If not, is anyone else willing to hack the config scripts
to enforce this dependency?  This is not my area of
competency.
Thanks,
	Miles
