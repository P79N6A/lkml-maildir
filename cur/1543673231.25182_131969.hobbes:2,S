           Summary: using xmodmap to reverse mouse buttons, causes button 3
                    to behave as though 1 & 3 both pressed
    Kernel Version: 2.5.69
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: tonyagee@earthlink.net
Distribution: RH9
Hardware Environment:
  Machine A: Athlon 1.2, via686b/8233, IMPS/2 mouse (MS Optical)
  Machine B: Duron 650, via586a, IMPS/2 (MS wheel mouse)
Software Environment: XFree86 4.3.0 (RedHat dist.)
Problem Description: I have an xmodmap command in my .Xclients-default, to
reverse my mouse buttons. Works fine anywhere but in 2.5.69 from kernel.org. 
With 2.5.69 running,  button 3 both invokes desktop menus and executes items
from them, while button 1  seems not to work at all. If I run xmodmap -e
"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5" then the mouse behaves normally for a right-handed mouse.
Which doesn't suit me at all :-(
Steps to reproduce:
xmodmap  -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5"
click button 3 on desktop
 <context menu appears>
