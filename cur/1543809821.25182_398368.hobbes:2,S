It would be nice to have one place to go to find burners, and to have 
the model information in that place. I would logically think that place 
is sysfs, and I know the kernel has the information because if I root 
through /proc/bus/usb and /proc/scsi/scsi, and /proc/ide/hd?/model I can 
eventually find out what the system has connected.
I not entirely sure about having classes other than cdrom, just because 
we already have CD, DVD, DVD-DL, and are about to add blue-ray and 
HD-DVD, so if I can tell that it's a removable device which can read 
CDs, the applications have a fighting chance to looking at the device to 
see what it is. As a human I would like the model information because 
the kernel has done the work, why should people have to chase it when it 
could be in one place?
