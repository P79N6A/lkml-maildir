#define __GFP_REPEAT	0x400	/* Retry the allocation.  Might fail */
#define __GFP_NOFAIL	0x800	/* Retry for ever.  Cannot fail */
__GFP_REPEAT is mainly for higher-order allocations which would otherwise
have given up too early.
__GFP_NOFAIL means "the caller is lame and cannot handle a failure".
Yes, they're the same thing at present.  But if someone chooses to change
the page allocator so that it returns 0 on exhaustion rather than
oom-killing, these two things become different - the altered page allocator
should continue to loop-until-success on __GFP_NOFAIL allocations.
I guess this means that __GFP_NOFAIL allocators shouldn't be oom-killed.
