Dear Trond,
Thank you very very much, that is it! rpc.statd was running on the server
but not the client. I have started it and it now works.
The stupid thing is I was really close to seeing this weeks ago, but got
confused by various ancient pieces of documentation and by the fact
that you don't need rpc.lockd any more because lockd is now part of the
kernel.
And the high-level message is: starting SuSE 8.1 you need to type
   chkconfig nfslock on
if you want NFS locking to work on the client. And probably on the server
too.
