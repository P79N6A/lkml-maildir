Hi!
 I just compiled 2.3.51 installed it and boot.
 After starting XFree, it turns out, that the ptys under devfs are
 not accesible or something that way, cause rxvt/xterm could not 
 be started ("not ptys available")...
 Extra pty support was not configured as it was said in the Readmes und
 Documentation/filesystems/devfs...
 Any idea what I done wrong ?
 KEEP HACKING!
