We might also want to flag non-cached and dma areas too.
That way we can hand cached, non-dma memory to the kernel,
use non-cached stuff for buffer memory and page tables,
keeping dma-able memory relatively clean and keeping the
kernel (and critical pages) fast.
Maybe the execute bit should also have some influence on
placement. Having executable text in uncached memory may
well give a larger performance penalty than putting user
data there...
In my zone allocator design I have outlined 5 or 7 (depending
on how you look at it) different memory usages for the Linux
kernel. You might want to check that out to see if you've
overlooked something:

It's very well possible to keep separate free memory stats
and free memory from the different area's as needed.
