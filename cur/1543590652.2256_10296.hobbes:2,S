In theory, and for just ip configuration, nothing.
I should have given more information though.  My goal is actually to
NFSRoot the machine being booted.  I could not determine a way to get
the "root path" attribute given by the dhcp/bootp server from
userspace back to the kernel so that it can
"change_root()/mount_root()" with it.  I seem to recall there was a
proc interface for doing this at one time (in the 2.2 kernel) but it
seemed to have went away.

If there were a way to tell the kernel, from userspace, for
change_root()/mount_root() where the nfsroot path was, yes.  I have
been hunting through all of the (nfs) root mount code and I don't see
it.  It looks like it can be set either on the command line, or by the
kernel implementation of bootp.  Am I missing it somewhere?
