The problem has been one of time. I've spent the last few weeks first
at a conference, then travelling, then came back and promptly caught
the flu (misery for a week). And then bring my main machine up to date
after an extended absence. So soon I should be able to start tackling
that mountain of devfs email I've got in my inbox :-( Oh. And I need
to write a better HOWTO :-(
I need a clone.
