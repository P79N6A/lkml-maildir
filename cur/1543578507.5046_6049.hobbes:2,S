I just noticed another strange effect:
ps uxa misses a couple dozen processes. Effectively I'm seeing
only the kernel processes, all gettys, rpc.portmap, bash and ps.
All other processes, all daemons etc. are invisible. If I kill
portmap another process becomes visible.
I've checked a couple of other machines, different setups etc.
all with -ac6 and all show this behavior - also the umount stuff.
