I sometimes have keyboard and mouse problems after changing machines
using a mechanical KVM, on a Logitech mouse.  This script fixes it for
me.
/usr/local/bin/switched
#!/bin/sh
/etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm restart
/sbin/kbdrate -r 30
I run gpm in redirect -R mode as
  daemon gpm -t $MOUSETYPE -R -m /dev/ttyS0
and tell X11 to read from /dev/gpmdata as
   Protocol        "MouseSystems"
   Device          "/dev/gpmdata"
not directly from the mouse; the redirect protocol is always
MouseSystems, no matter what the underlying mouse type is.  Restarting
gpm after KVM switch then fixes everything else.
