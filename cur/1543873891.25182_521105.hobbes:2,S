Yes, it's an X problem.
There's two issues, really -- smooth pointer movement or the lack
thereof and the servicing of clients at varying priorities. There's
vague plans floating around about moving all input processing off into a
separate high-priority thread and pretty much no ideas how to deal with
mixed priority clients.
So, the current scheduler works around this brain damage using
heuristics that sort of do the job and sometimes screw things up.

RSDL is, above all else, fair. Predictably so.
Hacking around X's stupidity makes it no longer *be* RSDL.
Until they catch up to the early-90s technology-wise, we can just nice
-19 X.
