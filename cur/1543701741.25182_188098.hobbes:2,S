P-M is not a P4 core, it's an enhanced PIII core.
SSE2 was added, but compiler support for SSE2 f.p.
math shouldn't matter for the kernel.
Using P4 optimisations on a P-M may actually reduce
performance, due to the different micro-architectures.
(P4 made shifts and some leas more expensive, and
simple add/and/sub/etc less expensive.)
IOW, don't lie to the compiler and pretend P-M == P4
with that -march=pentium4.
And since P-M doesn't do SMP, does cache line size even
matter? There are no locks to protect from ping-ponging.
