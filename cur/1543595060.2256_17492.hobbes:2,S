No, I remember that.  But if I don't remind lkml periodically that there is
work not done on this, I fear it will slide to the bottom of peoples'
to-do lists and fall off.  That's how we got to the distressing state where
about 1/4 of the configuration symbols weren't documented.  
I solved this problem by (a) working like a dog at writing help
entries myself, and (b) using a combination of supplication and
irritation on configuration maintainers to get them to hold up their
end.  This was effective; we've gone from 537 undocumented symbols to 2.
In any situation like this, supplication tends to work well initially;
you catch the cooperative people who would almost have done what you
needed anyway, which is usually 60% or more of them.  As you get
towards the bottom of the barrel, (subtle) irritation becomes more
important.  While it isn't *necessarily* the case that the last few
holdouts won't move unless you're a persistent pain in the butt about
it, that's the smart way to bet.
(I've done jobs like this before.  Couldn't you tell?  :-))

That's very good, and I thank you for that policy.   From *you*, I don't
want anything else.  From the person(s) reponsible for the missing symbols,
I want documentation.  The problem is that, lacking a detailed database
of who is responsible for what, I don't know how to prod each of the
people I really want to supplicate/irritate without having you see it
also.

weak.
