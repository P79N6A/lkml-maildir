hello,
i have big problem with my nfs-mounts.
sometimes, the nfs-mount is stalled an i can only reaktivate it, when i umount and 
mount it again.
when a program is accessing this mount, and i can't kill it,i  must reboot the pc.
the most time, i have this problem with this pc's:
the server is a p3-550 :
Linux linux-p3 2.2.20 #20 SMP Mon Apr 29 18:17:06 CEST 2002 i686 unknown
the client is a p2-350 dual-system:
Linux p2-350 2.4.18-SMP #1 SMP Sat Jul 20 01:52:33 CEST 2002 i686 unknown
i have the problem with stalled nfs-mounts also on a 486dx66:
Linux 486dx 2.2.19 #1 Sun Apr 21 10:39:32 CEST 2002 i486 unknown
the network have no problems, the problem comes from the nfs-connection.
when i only have a chance to kill the hanging processed and the stalled mount, i can 
reaktivate it, without reboot.
but the mount is busy by the hanging program and i can't kill the program, because 
the nfs is stalled and i can't umount the nfs, because it is busy by the program.
there is not posibility to break this ring, also i reboot the pc.
goodby
