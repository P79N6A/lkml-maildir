Greetings,
 I'm reporting of the first port of new architecture(armnommu) for 2.6
kernel is done.
 I planning the patch against recent kernel version will be announced in
this month, after some test and addition of 1~2 more chips. The current
port include support of only one (Samsung S5C7375 SoC) for test.
 As you know, the official 2.6 linux kernel merged uClinux, but the
ARM(w/o mmu) was not included.
 You'll find more detail on 
http://www.ucdot.org
 , soon. Any comment is
welcomed.
PS: I worked on toolchain for linux kernel compile, too. it works for
now, of course.^^  However, there is some toolchain trouble yet for user
program compile, and think there will, too. Is there anyone who're
interested on that work?
