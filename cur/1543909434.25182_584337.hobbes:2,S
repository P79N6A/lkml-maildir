Hm... I've got a 0.95.  I'll try to get a Via EHCI 1.00 controller and
make sure it's the same problem.

That kernel parameter sounds like a reasonable idea to me.  The problem
that the patch is trying to work around is that, while the CPUs are
changing frequency, the EHCI controller gets delayed trying to read main
memory (because CPU cache snoops have to wait until the CPU is
finished)... if this happens in the middle of a split transaction to a
low/full speed device, the transaction won't complete in time, and you
get an error and possible data loss.
If the EHCI controller caches ahead enough, it shouldn't need to read
main memory to be able to complete the split transaction... but, while
the controller does say how much ahead it may cache, it isn't clear to
me that it will always be able to cache that much, so I thought it would
be safe to go ahead and inactivate split transactions during CPU
frequency transitions regardless.
