Hi Scott,
I've taken a quick look and I noticed a few things: first of all I 
recommend making a patch against the v4l-dvb repository as there have 
been a few changes compared to 2.6.16 that are relevant. In particular 
your device should start supporting VIDIOC_INT_G/S_AUDIO_ROUTING 
commands instead of VIDIOC_G/S_AUDIO. See the definition of these 
commands in v4l2-common.h for more info. This also implies that a 
media/tlv320aic23b.h header should be added (look at the existing 
headers such as wm8775.h).
I also noticed what seems to be a superfluous TODO in the 
VIDIOC_INT_AUDIO_CLOCK_FREQ implementation.
The enum (R7, R11, etc) isn't used and can be removed.
The input field of struct tlv320aic23b_state doesn't seem to be used, so 
that too can be removed.
You probably do not have to implement the VIDIOC_S_FREQUENCY command, 
that was wm8775 specific. I doubt it is necessary for this driver.
It is also a good idea to add support for older kernels to this driver 
(again, see the #if lines in the wm8775.c driver).
Hmm, well that seems to be it.
Thanks!
	Hans
