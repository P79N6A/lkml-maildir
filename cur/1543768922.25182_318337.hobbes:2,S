you already have that anyway!
There are several kernel data structures that have padding in them
ifdef'd on older gcc versions just to work around bugs; gcc2 -> gcc3 as
a result has a major different abi anyway so I don't think your argument
holds.. (and in 2.6, the gcc version is part of the VERMAGIC so the
exact compiler is enforced anyway)
