Hi Andrew,
I tried lilo 22.7.3 with FC6 Test2 with 2.6.19-rc1 and all the relocatable
patches and things work fine for me. Commnand line is also being recognized
properly.
Looks like something specific to your setup. Can you please provide some
more details
- Do you see any failure messages?
- Can you please provide your /etc/lilo.conf file.
- What lilo version are you using?
- Can you please also upload your kernel config file.
Thanks
Vivek
