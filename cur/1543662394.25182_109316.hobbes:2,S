I have an embedded system running a standard 2.4.18-3 Kernel. This system
has to send a message every 100ms via the default gateway to a partner
machine. There was a scenario where the system ARP'ed the gateway for its
address. The response was seen on the sniffer. The system however continued
to send ARP requests. A dump of the ARP cache showed it as incomplete. Any
ideas?
Please CC me directly on any responses.
