Yes indeed, one code path is:
tty_flip_buffer_push()
if (tty->low_latency)
	flush_to_ldisc() {
		tty->ldisc.receive_buf() == n_tty_receive_buf() {
			...
			n_tty_receive_char() {
				...
				start_tty() {
					tty->driver->start() == uart_start()
and that's where we try to grab the uart port lock again.
It seems lots of serial drivers have this bug, even 8250.c :-)
I'll fix up the Sparc drivers meanwhile.
