Please don't send patches as attachments, and please don't send more than
one patch per email.
If you stick to the one-patch-per-email rule, you also get an opportunity
to nicely describe each patch within its email.
Coding style nit:
	if (foo)
		bar();
is preferable to
	if (foo) {
		bar();
	}
More broadly: Help!
I am 100% not in a position to judge whether Linux needs Comprehensive
System Accounting, nor am I able to define what the requirements for such a
thing should be.  All I can tell from your patch is the quality of its
implementation, and that's leaping far, far ahead of where we should be.
We're going to need help from you, and from all the other stakeholders in
judging how useful this feature is to Linux implementors and how well this
implementation meets the (unknown) requirements.  See my problem?
I've cc'ed lse-tech, where enterprise folks hang out.  I would request that
the people who are stakeholders in this feature
a) stick their hands up
b) let us know how important this kind of feature is for their users
c) review the offered feature set against their requirements
d) let us know how well the implementation fits that requirement and
e) inform us of any competing implementations.  Compare and contrast.
Thanks.
