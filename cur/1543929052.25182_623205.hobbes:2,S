Subject: [RFC] kobject: add kobject_init_ng, kobject_add_ng, and kobject_init_and_add functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/30/345

This is what the kobject_init function is going to become.  Add it to
the kernel and then we can convert over the current kobject_init() users
before renaming it.
Also add a kobject_init_and_add function which bundles up what a lot of
the current callers want to do all at once, and it properly handles the
memory usages, unlike kobject_register();
