Hi,
I have integrated a couple of kgdb features from TimeSys Linux distribution.
1.  Automatic loading of module files in gdb:
A special version of gdb is provided with this feature. It can detect loading 
and unloading of modules in a kernel. Whenever a module is loaded, gdb loads 
the module object file and makes it available for debugging. loadmodule.sh 
script is no longer needed.
2. Better kernel stack traces:
Kernel stack traces stop at entry points into the kernel and few invalid stack 
frames appear in gdb kernel backtraces, if any.
These features are available in kgdb-1.9 at 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net
