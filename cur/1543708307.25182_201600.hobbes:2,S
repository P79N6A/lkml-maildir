This one sounds a bit scary. I think it could hurt the 
asm-x86_64/bitops.h:find_first_zero_bit if there is a race that 
changes the value in memory between the last scasl and the bsfl
and the inliner assumes the edx output argument is zero extended.
Hopefully that case should be unlikely enough. I guess best would
be to change the function to use 64bit accesses to avoid this completely.
