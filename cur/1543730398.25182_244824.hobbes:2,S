... Why spinlock?
Are rwlocks not smart way to decrease the impact on I/O performance?

What I can only imagine is... passing somthing like a identifier of
looking bridge to driver as cookie, functionally, it's sounds good.
... Are there any other useful usages of the cookie?

Sure.
So taking a spinlock between this pair clearly means long time locking on
I/O, this will block all other I/O under same bridge, I think this isn't
good situation.  Still do we take a spinlock?
