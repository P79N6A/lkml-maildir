Subject: knfs quota fix, and some locking ramblings.

First, as maintainer of the Debian knfs tools, I got a report that
chown() from an nfs client didn't properly update quotas on the server.
A quick look in nfsd/vfs.c revealed that setattr didn't do
DQUOT_TRANSFER() if the owner changed. The first patch fixes that.
Note! I haven't been able to test it since I couldn't get quotas
working (alpha problem perhaps?), but it seems simple enough. The
patch is relative 2.2.5 + patches in knfsd-1.2.2 tarball. (Scott, can
you try it please?)
Then, I was also told that files marked for mandatory locking were
not openable via NFS (even if they weren't regular files). The first
fix was pretty obvious, make sure the file is a regular file before
deciding it is marked for mandatory locking. I also noted that the
nfs server always clears the setgid bit of a file when it is written
to (this should not occur if the file is marked for mandatory locking).
The question is, should they be openable via NFS? And if so, under
what circumstances? The current NFS client refuses to lock files
marked for mandatory locking (is there a reason other than that
locking doesn't work well over NFS for this?). I tentatively changed
things to allow opens unless the file is already locked on the
server... This patch is relative 2.2.5 + knfsd-1.2.2 + quota patch.
Also, in playing around with the locking I noted that locks on the
server are independent from locks on the clients. That is, if one
NFS client locks a file, the lock is seen by other NFS clients.
However, locks on the server are not seen on the clients, and the
server doesn't see client locks, so trying to lock a file on
a client and the server, both obtain a lock! I haven't been able
to figure out why this is happening though...
