For the record, I used console=lp0 quite recently (stock 2.6.19 according to 
the printout, running on i386) [to find out what was causing a panic that 
immediately vanished off the top of the screen because of "atkbd.c: Spurious 
ACK..."s from the flashing kb LEDs] and it worked just fine.
The parport-related lines went:
lp: driver loaded but no devices found
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
parport0: Printer, EPSON Stylus COLOR 600
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven)
lp0: console ready
... then the kernel continued booting until the panic occurred (it was a silly 
storage-related misconfig on my part).
If anyone wants me to try anything (newer kernel or different parport-related 
BIOS settings, perhaps, to see if I can duplicate the problem?) and report 
back, let me know.
