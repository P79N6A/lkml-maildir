Which -mm patch? If that patch contains the error, the bk8 contains it 
as well and the bk7 doesn't, that might already make serching a bit
easier. Or maybe 2.6.6, if you want a stable release. Not tested yet.

You might try the last working one, 2.6.7 with bk7. You might as well
have to replace the drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c with on from a later virsion
(>bk15), as the cdrom device is generally marked write-protected with
bk2 to bk14.
But instead of just trying those kernel versions, I think we might try
and find the changes that might have had the unfortunate side effect. I
am admittedly not too good at that, as I do not even know C (shame on
me).

This is what I did.

I've been after this for months now, before finally posting here...
