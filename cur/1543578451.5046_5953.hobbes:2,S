mm..  An `alias 3c575_cb 3c59x' in modules.conf works, but
screws things up when you boot back into 2.2.  Alternative
is to go into the modules directory and symlink 3c575_cb->3c59x
The other problem is that in 2.4 cardmgr isn't told the
name of the interface which was bound to the newly-inserted NIC.
I don't know why more people aren't getting bitten by this
with pcmcia-cs+2.4.
I have a rude patch against the pcmcia-cs scripts at
	
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/3c59x-2.3-changelog.txt
which works around this.
