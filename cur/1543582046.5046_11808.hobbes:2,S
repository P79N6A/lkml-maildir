Seriously though folks, look at who's doing this!
They've already tried once to sue 'Linux', were told they couldn't because
Linux is a non-entity (or at least one that they can not effectively sue
due to the classification Linux holds), and now they can't use their
second favorite tactic for stifling NON-M$ product lines.
How? They can't BUY the linux code base OR any GPL's software to the point
that they can bury it by buying and freezing the code from public use.
We sort HAD to expect something like THIS to come. Though what DOES
concern me is how effective this current ploy may be if they get ANY sort
of backing from the government. (I doubt they will, but What If?)
Let's hope EFF and FSF stay on their toes for this one. M$ doesn't have to
win to really wipe our nose in stuff. They got the cash whereas we don't.
ALTHOUGH, spending money to fight an idea or concept has never proven
successful. And since the RESULTS of that idea or concept (in this case
source code) are not suable AFAIK. So we got the upper hand there.
