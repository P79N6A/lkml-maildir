First off, congratulations to Linus, Alan, and the countless hackers on
the fine new kernel.  Long live Linux!
Now for the questions, just two of them related to 2.2.0.
1.  What's the 2.2 way of writing
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, xxx);
without the "deprecated call" warning in the logs.
and
2.  Can someone direct me to information on how to use the Linux Socket
Filter?
Thanks.
Gerard
