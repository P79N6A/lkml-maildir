I have installed a second hard drive in my system in the second
channel of my controller.But when I try to enable DMA I get:
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
I thought that there were problems only with Via VT82C686B.
Can anyone please help me?
My motherbord is an ASUS K7V with KX133 chipset.
