Yes, this can be implemented in userspace by setting init's filter
before init forks any other processes.
I can understand the practical problems with that form of implementation
however :(
Or does the patch change other behaviour?  Say, when mm_init() is
called by a kernel thread (current->mm==NULL)?  call_usermodehelper(),
for example?
If so, then setting init's filter doesn't cover that case.
