I forgot to note that there is a correctness dependence on an my
kill switch_exec_pids patch.  Without that task_refs will
stop being able to track a pid when we pass it on to
a new process in de_thread.
I built this patchset against Linus latest kernel and not -mm so I think
I may have one or two trivial conflicts with Olegs changes as
well.  In particular I have some changes to unhash_process() that Oleg
has removed, but simply removing that hunch should be all the resolution
that is needed.  Hopefully that won't be a problem..
