The Solaris /etc/path_to_inst method works 99.9% as expected. And important,
it is very stable in special for novice users. If you really have the problems 
as described, you could alwas edit /etc/path_to_inst manually and reboot.
Please note: If you install two systems with te same hardware configuration the 
same way _and_ in the same _order_, the will have an identical 
/etc/path_to_inst.
If I have to decide between a mostly rock solid system and a system that always 
behaves in a way that is not predictable, I would take the first one.

The author of this driver lacks the needed experience in writing DLPI drivers.
Although this lack of knowledge seems to be not uncommon (the FORE ATM driver 
is broken too), it is possible to do it right. The ATM DLPI driver I did write 
in 1995 did work correctly after I did educate me about the correct interface.
You simply need to be able to deal with the fact that instance #0 os a driver 
is not present while one or more instances with instance # > 0 _are_ present.

Looks like a similar problem as above.
