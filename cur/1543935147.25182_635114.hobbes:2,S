Hi,
when booting kernel 2.6.24-rc{4,5,6,7} top reports up to 100% iowait, even if 
no program accesses the disc on my Thinkpad T40p. Kernel 2.6.23.12 does not 
suffer from this. Is there anything I can do to find out which process or 
which part of the kernel is responsible for this? I can try to bisect it, but 
maybe there are other possibilities to debug this, since I cannot boot this 
computer frequently. I discovered, that there is no iowait within the first 
few seconds after waking up from suspend to ram...
regards,
Jörg
