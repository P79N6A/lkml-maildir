Okay, now I think I understood this part of the code correctly. The 
reason why I observe a continous migration of the _lower_ priority tasks 
is most probably due to the fact that the higher priority one is 
currently running, according to:
	can_migrate_task() in move_tasks(), and therein:
	if (task_running(rq, p))
		return 0;
I tracked down via an extended /proc/schedstats that my tasks fall 
frequently into this pitfall. I basically solved it by making use of the 
more active push-strategy which is called later by load_balance() once 
the move_tasks() function did not succeed. So in case I need the higher 
priority tasks, I return immediately from move_tasks().
Thanks for your help,
Martin
