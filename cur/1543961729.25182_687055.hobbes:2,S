This patch reminded me that I should update the CPUSETS maintainers,
which I will be sending in a separate patch shortly.
However, that in turn highlights one problem with updating several
MAINTAINERS entries at once; it will almost surely collide with
other ongoing updates to the MAINTAINERS file.  On that account,
your proposal might not be worth the extra effort it would take to
get merged ... I'm not sure.
