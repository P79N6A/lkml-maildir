No. The point is that they're not *there* and have to be modified
for every kernel version. And do you mean with or without the markers
in the code to tell the dynamic probes where to hook in, and what data
to fetch? that makes a huge difference.
Suppose, as a very real example, I want to instrument shrink_list.
There are 20 or so places where it can switch what we're doing with
a page for different reasons. Potentially we're scanning through many
thousands of pages. If I can keep counters as I go through the function,
and then do one trace entry at the end, that's fairly efficient. If I
have to create 20 separate hooks that all jump out of line, it's going
to be a lot slower. If I log a tracepoint at every damned page every
time it switches, it's going to be a nightmare.
Most things can be done with dynamic probes. Some things will require
markers in the code to tell us sustainably over time where to attatch
them. A few things (like the above) probably require some explicit
code.

As long as they all use the same infrastructure, that's an improvement.

In the absence of the markers, I don't think that's true - there's the
maintenance of exactly where they go, plus access to local data. If you
mean with markers, then yes, that's fine. The markers + dynamic probes
seems to be a reasonable compromise between the two. Exactly what we
call that combo, static or dynamic, I don't really care ;-)

You're thinking of one situation where you can't recompile. I'm thinking
of a situation where it's trivial to recompile. Both exist, neither is
invalid. Of course, where possible, we'd like to be able to add stuff
on the fly, but it's not a panacea.
Without the markers, maintaining a usable set of dynamic probe points
that's always available for every kernel version seems infeasible.
With them, I think it'll cover 99% of the cases, and would be pretty
useful. If people agree on putting tags in there, perhaps we can
discuss things like the logging mechanism, format, and readout.
If not, I suppose we have to drag this debate out even longer.
