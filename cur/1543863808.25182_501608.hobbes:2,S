Cool ... two of those (#1, #5) seem ok to merge right now, and
I expect that #2 can go in with only minor tweaks.
#3 needs more attention (see my response) and I'll have to look
at #4 soon.
Thanks for looking at this.  I know various folk have needed to
have MMC/SD working over SPI for some time, and was hoping that
someone else would make time to take that code the next few steps
on the way.  Just like you did!
So to summarize ... you now have MMC-over-SPI working on CRIS
hardware, with these patches?   Can you yet run filesystem
stress tests with ext3 on such an MMC card, or is this more at
the level of everything working with light/early test loads,
so it's time to see if other folk can reproduce your results?
