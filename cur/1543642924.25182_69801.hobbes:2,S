Ok, the problem is that ide-scsi builds a request which eventually ends
up going through the ide code dma mapping. ide_build_sglist() does a
rq_data_dir() on the request, which BUG()'s if the command isn't an fs
read or write. This actually went undetected before, because the ide
code did:
	if (rq->cmd == READ)
		direction is dma from device
	else
		direction is to device
and rq->cmd is IDESCSI_PC_RQ in this case. So we always mapped for dma
to the device, even if that wasn't the case.
Hmm, maybe just adding a single direction bit to struct request is the
easy way out for 2.4. Or... I'll cook something up.
