Maybe what is needed here is this:
T1 - T2 .. Tn .. Tp
  \         \      \
   \         M1     M2
    \       /      /
     B1 .. Bm .. Bo
where T1..Tp are the upstream commits, B1..Bo are the local commits, and
M1.. are the test merges just to make sure nothing breaks?
As long as the Mx commits resolve automatically, no need for an explicit 
merge in the Bx commits, since a pull from B into T will just recreate an 
Mx as next commit in T.
Kind of "throw away merge".
Ciao,
Dscho
