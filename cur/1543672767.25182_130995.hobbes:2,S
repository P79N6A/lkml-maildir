As a 'me too' the same is true on inspiron 8500, under 2.4 and 2.5. 
I've got a fixed-up DSDT installed (see the guide at
http://www.cpqlinux.com/acpi-howto.html
 and
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/bios_override.htm
 ..)
and that drops some of the noise (and fixes some of the missing bits)
but acpid and others (basically any acpi call) results in similar
messages.
Its not a kernel issue (well, its a warning from the kernel.. but the
kernel can't fix this directly.)  Turning off ACPI debugging will
probably make it stop, but the underlying issue is Dell (and many other
vendors) don't test their ACPI firmware under anything except windows.
>From Intel's ACPI site (and this applies to many acpi issues):
Q16. What is the "implicit return" issue, and why hasn't it been fixed?
A16. {cut} Due to an errata, this bug does not manifest itself on
Windows' ACPI implementations, and therefore was not detected when OEMs
tested their systems using that OS.
 
 We've made the decision for now to not be bug-for-bug compatible with
existing ACPI OS implementations. We are implementing according to the
ACPI specification's requirements, and hopefully this may drive better
compliance on all operating systems.
