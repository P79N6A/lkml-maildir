I think I may be seeing something odd here, maybe a possible memory leak.
The only problem I have is wondering whether I'm actually comparing like
with like.  Maybe some networking people can provide a hint?
Below is gathered from 2.6.11-rc1.
bash-2.05a# head -n2 /proc/slabinfo

I'm fairly positive when I rebooted the machine a couple of days ago,
ip_dst_cache was significantly smaller for the same number of lines in
/proc/net/rt_cache.
