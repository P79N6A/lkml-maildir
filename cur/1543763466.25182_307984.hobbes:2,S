Hi Herbert,

I've explored the issue a bit. According RFC-1950 and RFC-1951, zlib 
stream is:
2bytes zstream header, block1, block2, ... 4bytes adler32.
Each block has one 1-byte "end-of-block" marker and a prefix of max len = 
1 byte.
In our code we do zlib_deflate(stream, Z_SYNC_FLUSH), so we always flush 
the output. So the final zlib_deflate(stream, Z_FINISH) requires 1 byte 
for the EOB marker and 4 bytes for adler32 (5 bytes total). Thats all. If 
we compress a huge buffer, then we still need to output those 5 bytes as 
well. I.e, the overhead of each block *is not accumulated* ! I even need 
to make the reserved space less then 12 bytes!
Anyway, don't apply that patch please, I'll send a new one.
