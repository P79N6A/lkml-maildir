Well, err, I guess I'm pretty stupid, but how about this?  If the lxr guy
is listening to all this, he could download a copy of BK, clone the FSMlabs
tree, then I'll do a null pull from him, and we'll have an apples to apples
comparison, now won't we?
I think it's a pointless thing to do, I already know that CVS transfers way
more data to do the same operation so it's a foregone conclusion it will be
slower.  But I'm very happy to do it if the lxr guy (sorry, I've forgotten
your name, I apologize) is willing.  Send me private mail, it shouldn't take
very long at all to get you set up.
