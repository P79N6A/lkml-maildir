Since you did such a fine job of describing the problem,
I can actually tell what the trouble is and how to fix 
it even though I'm not currently using that driver.  
The problem begins with the fact that <all> ioctls are
vectored to the ioctl entry point of the atmdev that is registered
on the interface in question.  In this case, all 
are vectored to ia_ioctl().  Right near the
beginning of that ia_ioctl() you will see: 
   if (!dev->phy->ioctl) return(-EINVAL);
In "theory" the dev->phy pointer was set in suni_init()
to point to the suni ioctl handler. 
However, in reality, if you look around line 2528 in iphase.c
you will see that suni_init is NOT called if the phy is
25mbps, DS3, or E3 (as yours is).  
Thus phy = 0 at the time of the call and the attempt to
evaluate dev->phy->ioctl causes the seg fault shown below.
(eax is holding what should be phy).

The obvious simple solution is to insert
   if (!dev->phy) return(-EINVAL)
(or I suppose you could also add a phy driver for your interface)
