The problem seems to be surprisingly old.
In -mm, I was able to reproduce it in 2.6.8.1-mm1 (several older -mm 
kernels don't boot on my machine due to the floppy issues already 
discussed).
In Linus' tree, 2.6.9-rc1 is OK, but both 2.6.9-rc2 and 2.6.9-rc4 show 
this problem.
What else might matter? Userspace? I'm using a Debian unstable.
