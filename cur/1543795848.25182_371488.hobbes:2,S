Well, the batch size of a list ( + the high mark) are integral part of
per_cpu_pagelist infrastructure.  Tuning is always required.  I don't
think though one fixed set of values is fixing all the cases.  
Can you please comment on the performance delta on the MPI workload
because of this change in batch values.  And what were the numbers
before per_cpu_pagelists were introduced.
thanks,
