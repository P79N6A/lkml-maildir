Reboot and fsck should fix that sort of problem, assuming there's nothing
wrong with the physical disk where that inode is.  You will probably lose
the mailbox file though.
If you just delete it, e2fs may notice that the inode doesn't make sense
and panic or remount the filesystem read-write.  Either way, the mounted
filesystem will quickly become useless anyway until you umount/fsck/mount
it again.
