This fixes a SMP race condition in the non atomic version of the
br_read_lock (at least with the alpha semantics of rmb()) and removes a
rmb() not necessary in the slow path. If we want to flush the write queue
as soon as possible after the (*ctr)-- then we'd better use wmb() instead
of rmb() ;-). I didn't replaced the second rmb() with an wmb() because
that's code that never runs and I'd rather prefer to save icache.
