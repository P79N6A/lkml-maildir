I didn't know we still routed IRQs to isolated CPUs. I guess I need to
look deeper into the code on this one. But I agree that isolated CPUs
should not have IRQs routed to them.
>   [PATCH] [CPUISOL] Support for workqueue isolation
The thing about workqueues is that they should only be woken on a CPU if
something on that CPU accessed them. IOW, the workqueue on a CPU handles
work that was called by something on that CPU. Which means that
something that high prio task did triggered a workqueue to do some work.
But this can also be triggered by interrupts, so by keeping interrupts
off the CPU no workqueue should be activated.

This I find very dangerous. We are making an assumption that tasks on an
isolated CPU wont be doing things that stopmachine requires. What stops
a task on an isolated CPU from calling something into the kernel that
stop_machine requires to halt?
