Hi,
since ~ 2.3.40 the linux kernel hangs on a SIS5591/5592 when enabling
the second port.
Disabling it either in bios or with the kernel options makes him work on
the first port.
My Board is an Asus SP98AGP-X
Primary master: IBM-DHEA-36481
Primary slave: iomaga zip 100 ATAPI
-----------------------------------
Secondary Master: Mitsumi 2801TE
Secondry Slave: LiteOn 24X
On the other site, bus mastering would be greatful (I know, its no
common chipset)
I never got any ide probs on NT or OS/2. On linux, sometimes the cdrom
lost interrupt during initialisation.
Thanks,
werner Hager
