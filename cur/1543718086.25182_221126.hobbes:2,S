Speaking as somebody who's had stuff rejected for doing this sort of ifdef'ing,
the *right* fix is to go back and look at the definitions of everything, and
see if there's a reason why the compiler is tossing the warning.
Canonical example is, of course the userland:
	char c;
	if ((c=getc()) != EOF) {....
(I don't have a 2.4 tree handy to double-check, but maybe the variable 's'
should be something wider?  It's *quite* possible that there is/will be some
keyboard of the Chinese/Japanese/Korean persuasion which actually ends up with
more than 256 keymap entries.....
