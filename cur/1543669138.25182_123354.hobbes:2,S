Oooo... I want this OS! :-)

I think it could be useful, but is probably much more complicated in the
details... Like, for example, how would you know whether a file page in
memory had been used by only one process, or many, and what priority it
should have? What happens if the scheme conflicts with the LRU scheme?
What happens if the memory page is really a shared memory segment used
by both the application and X to double-buffer display the window?
Implementation of this is beyond my imagination today... I only see perils.
