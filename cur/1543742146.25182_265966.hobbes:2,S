Yes, those are generic concerns I had for a while :)

Proably not a problem in 99% of the cases, but sounds saner to do (oh,
and did I tell you that Darwin does this ? :) I think it may even be
better to 1) turn IO & MEM off in the command reg, 2) restore the stuff,
3) restore the command reg.

Well, some cards will have side effects, whatever you write there (like
going offline for a while, remember that thread about those nasty IBM
scsi controllers needing special workaround for this ? :)

Yes, which is why, in the meantime, just knowing about them in
save/restore and just saving/restoring a bit more is an acceptable
solution I think ....
