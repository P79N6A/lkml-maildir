I'd guess that a 32 byte alignment is much better here, 64 byte sounds
excessive. It should have the same effect with the current dentry layout
and default config options, but would keep the d_iname length in the
16-44 byte range instead of 16-76 byte as your patch does.
Since all important fields are supposed to be kept in 32 bytes anyway,
they are still either at the start or the end of a given cache line,
but never cross two.
