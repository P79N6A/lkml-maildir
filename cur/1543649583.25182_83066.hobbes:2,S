Because the zlib code option CONFIG_ZLIB_DEFLATE won't be set
to 'n' if the option isn't reset properly.  That means if you
set CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP_COMPRESS_GZIP and then not set it back
explicitly, the CONFIG_ZLIB_DEFLATE option doesn't get set to
'n' properly.
We explored a number of options, but this guarantees that the
zlib code doesn't get built if it doesn't have to.
