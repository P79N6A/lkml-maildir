Indeed.  To me the only value of random PIDs (as with random IP ids, and
random DNS query ids, and...) is not security through obscurity, but
obscurity through obscurity.  But this _is_ of value.  Why does anyone on
my box (or talking to my box) have to know how busy it is?  They don't need
to know, therefore I'd prefer not to tell them (although yes, I realize
there is a variety of other ways they could 'ask').
