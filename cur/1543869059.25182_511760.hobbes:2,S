I agree that it is a hack.

It is intended for reallocation of a buffer. The code in lookup.c allocates
some memory, and it may have to reallocate the buffer. The code tries to
prevent some unneeded allocations by looking at what the smallest object the
slabcache gives you is.
I hope this explains it better. There's some discussion about this in the
threads by Pekka Enberg.
