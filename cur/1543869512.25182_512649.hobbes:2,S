I believe I might have misunderstood the intention of this patch.
Assuming the user is smart enough not to queue packets destined
to a SOCK_VMIO socket, are you worried about unrelated packets
allocated from the emergency reserve not getting freed fast
enough because they're sitting in a queue? In that case simply
dropping the packets would be fine I guess.
