   Sorry I wasn't clear: I'm saying *replace*, not add,
I don't understand what you are proposing then.  There are some
instances that do want to know how many bytes did make it before
the -EFAULT event.
You have to add a new version of the interface to handle both
the case that cares about the length copied successfully and
the case that only cares about -EFAULT vs. !-EFAULT
