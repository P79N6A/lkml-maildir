Designing last changes in the infrastructure, shaking out bugs in said
design, completing cutover to new ways of doing things, migrating drivers,
integrating changes to non-ia32 architectures. Then getting it real stable
(perhaps a month or two). Then 2.4, let's say two to three months of 2.4
shakedown, then start 2.5.

Calling the current 2.3 2.4 won't make it stable. And nobody wants the 2.0
fiasko again: Let 2.3 mature before it gets to be 2.4, and let's hope for
at most 2.4.12 or so (like we are getting with 2.2).
Besides the problem with not enough hackers for the developement work, if
you fragment the development you are also fragmenting the testers, and this
definitely has negative impact on the kernel too.

Junk PCI, ISA; drop TCP/IP and firewalls. Many network drivers are broken
too, so kill a bunch of them. SCSI needs work... but that went out the
window with ISA and PCI, no further loss. PCMCIA won't go, no RAID, no
USB. Maybe salvage a filesystem or two, get rid of memory management. Plus
distributions are screwed as initrd and RAMdisks don't work either... Not
much left, is there?

That "short time" is what you will have to wait for 2.4, the development
_is_ in flux. No new features, just fixing what is in now. Ripping it out
for your proposal is probably more work than finishing it up, and the
result would be a 2.2 plus a few features that could be backported if
really needed.

Why wait? What your proposal would give is plain 2.2 + a few features -
stability. Go for 2.2!

The changes people have been developing in the wings that did not go into
2.3 now (and so probably won't ever be in 2.4) are being developed in
parallel (as private patches, whatever), they will surface when 2.5 comes
out, and hopefully be integrated in due time. No slowdown there, just the
visible head hackers slaving away at the _massive_ work of stabilizing and
cleaning up the mess.

But it is a lot of work. Not exactly sexy, but it has to be done.

This is not "porting", it is designing the right infrastructure and putting
it in place so that stuff like journalled filesystems can be integrated
seamlessly. Work that has been postponed for 2.5, with the agreement of the
respective authors.
