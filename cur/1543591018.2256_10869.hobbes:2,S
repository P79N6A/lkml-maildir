Guys,
I'm working on a network device that will forward some packets before 
they get to netif_rx and thus net_rx_action.  Thus, the forwarded 
packets handled by my device/protocol would not be traced by the 
existing trace utility (AF_PACKET etc.), correct?  Am I correct in 
assuming that there is no existing way to trace such fast-forwarded packets?
Mmy proposed solution to the problem is to implement a socket type for 
my (new) protocol family that will allow such packets to be traced.  
Simply open a socket eg socket(AF_MINE, SOCK_RAW, MYPROTO_TRACE) and you 
get a copy of the packets from the driver.  Is this an acceptable 
solution or are people cringing at the thought?
I came across the ethertap driver and it seems to do something along the 
lines of what I want to do, but I need to look at it more closely.
Comments?
Thanks,
Dave
