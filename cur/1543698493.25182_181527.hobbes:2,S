Oh, so it does; I was looking at the older version I wrote.

The issue is that validate_mem() doesn't need to use read_cis_mem's
functionality directly (so it can't just be modified to use the __*
form).  It calls other stuff, which calls other stuff, which
eventually calls read_cis_mem(), and all that other stuff is used by
other callers.  So there isn't an obvious place to insert this
bifurcation.

inv_probe() is pretty comprehensible, it calls itself directly, in
order to traverse a short linked list from tail to head.
