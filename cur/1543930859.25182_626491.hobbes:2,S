His driver is probably buggy.  When we had two drivers beginning
with e100 we often forgot to apply fixes to the both of them.  Now
that we have three it's even more confusing.
I just checked and indeed e1000e seems to be missing the NAPI fix
that was applied to e1000.  Of course it doesn't rule out the
possibility of another NAPI bug in e1000.
Cheers,
