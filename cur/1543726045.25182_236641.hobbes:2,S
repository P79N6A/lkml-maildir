A number of things in 2.4 were left alone until 2.6, other than getting 
lots of people to stay with old kernels why do you object to waiting to 
remove this feature in 2.7?
"mount ~/mycrypt" is simple enough for a user to use, dm-crypt is not 
remotely easy to use, not to mention that the tools all need to be added 
  to the install on every machine.
