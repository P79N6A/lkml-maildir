The justification is performance and a little on the simplicity side.
My personal feel is still that layer 3 is something easier done
as a new kind of table in an iptables type infrastructure.  And in
fact I believe if done that way would capture do what 90%+ of what
all of the iptables rules do.  So it might be a nice firewalling speed up.
I don't think the layer 3 idea where you just do bind filter fits
the namespace concept very well.
