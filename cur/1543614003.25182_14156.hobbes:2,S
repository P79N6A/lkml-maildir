I agree that the code complexity issue could be show stopper.  And since
it can be done from user space, that is where I'll go.   I did preface it
with a "0.1% issue"
As concerns the intersection between SMP and low-power user base, I
could imagine a lot of uses if the person or company gave a hoot about
not polluting.    A lot of companies buy dual CPU systems just in case
they might need the extra horse power.  And with new CPUs approaching
100 Watts or more.
Quoting aceshardware.com.:
" the EV7 is designed to run at roughly 1.2 GHz and dissipate 155W in an
0.18-micron process."
I could see this as a big selling point.    "Our OS uses less power, but
stick kicks M$ @$$.   That is how Transmeta's Linux is marketed, and
how the Via C3 and the Transmeta Crusoe CPUS are marketed.
Alas, further research shows that DeepSleep mode doesn't save much
over HALT mode assuming that you're correct when you say that

Example: PIII at 1 GHz
Normal Mode: 26-30 Watts
StopGrant: 6.9 A * 1.75 VCC = 12.08 W
Deep Sleep: 6.6 A * 1.75 VCC = 11.55 W
Difference = ~ 0.5 Watts
Example: Via C3
Normal Mode: 6-12 Watts
Halt: 1 Watt
Deep Sleep: 0.5 Watts
Difference = ~ 0.5 Watts
