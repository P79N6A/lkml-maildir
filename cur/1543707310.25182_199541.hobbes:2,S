Normally this would mean that somebody is trying to "kfree" a pointer that 
wasn't allocated with "kmalloc()". That seems unlikely in this case, so it 
might be a double free or some other internal corruption..
That "sys_delete_module()" thing seems like some stale kernel stack 
contents, so it's possible that that is the thing that messed up and left 
something in an inconsistent state.
Do you know what module it was?
