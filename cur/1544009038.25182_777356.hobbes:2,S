The MSI IRQ number is a pure software detail that was already non-stable 
due to device detection ordering, etc. It's counted back from NR_IRQS, 
and the sizing of NR_IRQS changed (upwards) in 2.6.28 - that's what you 
see.
The fact that MSI numbers goes back from NR_IRQs i consider a (minor) 
misbehavior: it should not count down but should count up - and it should 
not go to unreasonably high numbers if possible - that is confusing to 
users when the sizing of NR_IRQS changes to to a higher NR_CPUS for 
example.
A better (because more human-compatible) numbering scheme is to start 
counting upwards from the high end of physical interrupt lines. We've 
done that in the for-.29 sparseirq tree - there we'll start counting from 
256 upwards in essence. (the first 256 IRQs are GSI interrupts)
Maybe it should be counted starting at 1000? That might be an even more 
human-friendly numbering scheme.
