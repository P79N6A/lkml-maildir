The following in your .isyncrc file will do the trick:
Mailbox thunk
Box Inbox
Host thunk.org
Tunnel "socat SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:thunk.org:143 STDIO"
You can also do this via secure IMAP, but then ssh's compression won't
be able to do much.  Nevertheless, I do this when synchronizing
against an IMAP server where I don't have ssh access, and where I want
the connection between the thunk.org and po14.mit.edu to be secured.
So I use the following syntax in .isyncrc to achieve to do this:
Mailbox Inbox
Box Inbox
Host imaps:po14.mit.edu
Tunnel "socat SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:po14.mit.edu:993 STDIO"
UseSSLv2 yes
UseSSLv3 yes
UseTLSv1 yes
