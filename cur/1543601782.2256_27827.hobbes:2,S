I don't exclude it's a vm problem (and I know where to put the hands in
such case) but could you compare also with 2.4.10pre10 or anyways
something more recent than a 2.4.5 based kernel.  There are been changes
in the I/O subsystem as well meanwhile (ask Jens). I will also need to
check what pgbench is doing, where can I get it?
