There must be a way.  The key thing the VM needs to provide, and doesn't
now, is a function callable by the rpciod that will report to the caller
whether it was able to complete the invalidation without blocking.  (I
think I'm just rephrasing someone's earlier suggestion here.)
I'm now thinking in general terms about how to concoct a mechanism
that lets rpciod retry the invalidation later, for all those that turn
out to be blocking.  For example, rpciod could just keep a list of
all pending invalidates and retry each inode on the list every time
it has nothing to do.  This is crude and n-squarish, but it would
work.  Maybe it's efficient enough for the time being.  At least it's
correct, which would be a step forward.
Did you have some specific mechanism in mind?
