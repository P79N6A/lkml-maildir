The README file says one of its goals is to "explain how to install the
kernel".  The header files are part of the kernel (maybe it should be
called a "header/kernel system" ;) ).  To quote the Documentation/Changes
file, "some software still works, but needs to be compiled against 2.2
headers for complete functionality".
I agree that nearly everyone uses distributions, and that if a stable
environment is important one only should update anything with a good
reason, but someone who is reading the README file has probably already
found such a reason.  A bit of documentation like this seems like a good
thing:

+-  Some userland programs are compiled against the headers that come with the
+   kernel.  Customarily, the headers are installed in /usr/src/linux/include/

    You should now have the sources correctly installed.
 
 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The FAQ file that comes with glibc 2.1 has this to say: 
2.17.  I have /usr/include/net and /usr/include/scsi as symlinks
        into my Linux source tree.  Is that wrong?
{PB} This was necessary for libc5, but is not correct when using glibc. 
Including the kernel header files directly in user programs usually does
not work (see question 3.5).  glibc provides its own <net/*> and <scsi/*>
header files to replace them, and you may have to remove any symlink that
you have in place before you install glibc.  However, /usr/include/asm and
/usr/include/linux should remain as they were.
