Who said it wasn't distributable?  The license in the 2.4.5 file doesn't say
you cannot distribute it.  It doesn't even prevent you from sell it.  You have
to leave the notice intact and not use it as a means to attach the Qlogic
mark to any derived product.
Other than it's age, I see *zero* reason to remove it from the tree.
