Where does /usr/local/include/ come from, what is it linked to,... ???
/usr/include contains a copy of kernel headers shipped by your glibc.
/path/to/your/kernel/sources/include contains a copy of kernel headers 
shipped with the kernel you are trying to compile.
But where do these kernel headers under /usr/local/include/ come from?
