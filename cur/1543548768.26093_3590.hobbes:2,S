How about a simple "cost metric" for each request? (Each individual
request gets X "points", plus Y per block. Make Y almost zero for HDDs and
tape drives etc., make X and Y equal for solid state storage, say.)
In terms of latency, I'd suggest we aim to keep the device in use all the
time we have outstanding requests: every time the device is ready to
accept a request, we feed it the "next" one in the queue; until it is free
again, requests pile up in the queue, being sorted, merged etc.
This should perform very well under light loads - requests just get passed
to the device as fast as they can be handled - and under very heavy loads
- we have a large queue in play, with plenty of scope for reordering,
merges etc.

With the metrics above, you should be able to calculate appropriate values
for X and Y to make the "cost" figures roughly correspond to actual times,
I think? The big question, of course, is what do you do when the queue
reaches the maximum - block the next process to make a request? Better,
block all but the highest "I/O priority" process? Then, I can go copying,
moving and deleting files left, right and centre without my MP3 player
ever skipping, which is nice :-)
