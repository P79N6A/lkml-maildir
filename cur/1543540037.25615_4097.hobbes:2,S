It would be good to include more kernel messages (specifically the
startup messages from the PCMCIA drivers).  Also since the PCMCIA
support in the 2.4test kernels is experimental, it would be good to
compare this with the standalone PCMCIA driver modules, either running
on a stable kernel or on this same kernel.

I'd agree that this looks like an interrupt configuration problem.  It
is unlikely to be a problem with interrupt sharing, though.
