I am one of the heavy users of the kernel CVS repository on kernel.org 
(using rsync) and I also find cvsps a very valuable tool to bring order in 
the CVS caos. Since the operations that I find myself doing on such data 
are extremely repetitive, and CVS doesn't quite cut it, I put together a 
simple hack to help me in the automation of the process:

Because of its use of caches, it can build custom configuration pretty 
quickly. For example, in my machine when used together with the 
--hard-links option, it can build a configuration in less than 5 seconds.
