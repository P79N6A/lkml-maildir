Its hitting a bug - specifically (from bootmem.c:125):
BUG_ON(PFN_DOWN(addr) >= bdata->node_low_pfn);
I hit this problem on a db800 last week.  It went away with a newer
version of the BIOS, which doesn't help Joerg any, since its a different
board (though I think it is the same BIOS vendor).  Other BIOSes work
just fine with the same kernel image (including known troublemakers like
LinuxBIOS).  I believe that 2.6.22 was good, so some change must
have come along in 2.6.23-pre to cause the pain.  Or, it may have exposed
old breakage in the BIOS that was later repaired.
I'll do the math to figure out whats happening - and I'll check the release
notes to see what changed in the BIOS between the failing and working
version.  If anybody familiar with arch/i386 can think of something
new in the kernel that may have precipitated this, do let me know. :)
