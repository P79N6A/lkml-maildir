I already know that, but this is not the point. The point is that
more and more boxes have no serial (or paralel) ports. 
But even on those boxes, sometimes I'd just love to be able to use
kgdb. And I can't.
Ok, it will have to be at a higher level than the inb/outb serial
transport implementation (with possible bad effects on what can
and what cannot be debugged), but still, I feel there is a need
for that.
USB (with USB-to-serial adapter), network, ieee1394 would be 
acceptable replacements for me.
Stelian.
