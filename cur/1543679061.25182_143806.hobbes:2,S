This address is really messy since it's purely ASCII : "SEC 92:8"

ASCII here : "am( " and here "37.5"
> t2 = 000000006920676e  t3 = 5345432039323a34
and here : "i gn" and here too "SEC 92:4"
So it may result from some garbage being used as a pointer, or a char * being
jumped to.
Just my .02 euros,
