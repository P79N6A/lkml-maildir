The code as called from .c files should indeed be consistent.
However, since we never need to scan the non-reclaimable list,
we could use the inline functions in the .h files to have an
mlock count instead of a .lru list head in the non-reclaimable
pages.
At least, I think so.  I'm going to have to think about the
details a lot more.  I have no idea yet if there will be any
impact from batching the pages on pagevecs, vs. an atomic
mlock count...
