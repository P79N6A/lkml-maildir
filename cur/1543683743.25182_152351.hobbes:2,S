Please see if the patch below fixes this one.

Hm, appears to be on NEW_TO_OLD_UID(server->mnt->mounted_uid)
to me.  mounted_uid is of type __kernel_uid_t, which is unsigned short
on i386, so NEW_TO_OLD_UID() is rather useless on it.
Should mounted_uid be __kernel_uid32_t instead?

Yes, line 85 is useless as it is.
What -W (?) options are you compiling with?  I'm not seeing these.

Another unsigned char compared to value > 255.

Right, same as above.

Interesting.  How do I make this happen on my system?
Are you using some old (or new) version of gcc/gas or what?
