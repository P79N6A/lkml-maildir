I always thought x86 is becoming a really dirty architecture. I now think it 
is even uglier. :-p Thank you for the thorough explanation.

What the kernel selects by default is udma4 (66MB/s). I tried forcing udma5 
(100MB/s) with hdparm even though I think my chipset doesn't support it, and 
indeed there was a difference! After repetitive tests udma4 gives 20MB/s, 
udma5 gives 22MB/s. I'm mostly surprised however that I could even set this 
option.

I'm now trying to use the new libata driver and see what happens... 
Thanks,
