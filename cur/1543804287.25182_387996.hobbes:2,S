Hi there!
My kernel panics at every boot, see screenshot[1].
I upgraded my CPU to an Opteron 175 (Dual Core) and enabled SMP in the
kernel. With "nosmp" the kernel boots (but has problems finding one hard
disk later on, some IRQ timeout?). The kernel version is 2.6.15.1,
config see here[2].
With my current non-SMP-kernel (2.6.14.4) everything works.
Please tell me what that BUG message means and how I can get my system
running.
Addition information regarding the hardware can be found here[3].
Thanks a lot,
Carsten
