Does the compiler CSE these two calls to page_waitqueue()?
All versions?   I'd be inclined to do CSE-by-hand here.
Also, why wake_up_all()?  That will wake all tasks which are sleeping
in __lock_page(), even though they've asked for exclusive wakeup
semantics.  Will a bare wake_up() here not suffice?
