Subject: [PATCH 0/3] cgroup id and scanning without cgroup_lock

This is a series of patches againse mmotm-Nov29
(passed easy test)
Now, memcg supports hierarhcy. But walking cgroup tree in intellegent way
with lock/unlock cgroup_mutex seems to have troubles rather than expected.
And, I want to reduce the memory usage of swap_cgroup, which uses array of
pointers.
This patch series provides
	- cgroup_id per cgroup object.
	- lookup struct cgroup by cgroup_id
	- scan all cgroup under tree by cgroup_id. without mutex.
	- css_tryget() function.
	- fixes semantics of notify_on_release. (I think this is valid fix.)
Many changes since v1. (But I wonder some more work may be neeeded.)
BTW, I know there are some amount of patches against memcg are posted recently.
If necessary, I'll prepare Weekly-update queue again (Wednesday) and
picks all patches to linux-mm in my queue.
Thanks,
-Kame
