Subject: change to the ia64 GIT trees

Now that GIT is smarter, and I'm more aware of what it can do
(and how to make it do it), I'm making a small change to how
I export GIT trees on kernel.org.
Instead of having separate trees for test and release, there
is now just one tree which contains "test" and "release" branches.
[or there will be soon when my deletion of the old test tree
is reflected on the kernel.org mirrors].
You can pull each of the branches separately with:
 $ git pull rsync://rsync.kernel.org/..../aegl/linux-2.6 test
or
 $ git pull rsync://rsync.kernel.org/..../aegl/linux-2.6 release
I wrote a "howto" for GIT about using branches as a Linux
subsystem maintainer that was included in the GIT sources
yesterday.  You can read a copy at
