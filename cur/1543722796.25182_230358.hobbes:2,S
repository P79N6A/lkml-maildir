Subject: [PATCH] anon_vma list locking bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Vladimir Saveliev reported anon_vma_unlink list_del BUG (LKML 24 June).
His testing is still in progress, but we believe it comes from a nasty
locking deficiency I introduced in 2.6.7's anon_vma_prepare.
Andrea's original anon_vma_prepare was fine, it needed no anon_vma lock
because it was always linking a freshly allocated structure; but my
find_mergeable enhancement let it adopt a neighbouring anon_vma, which
of course needs locking against a racing linkage from another mm -
which the earlier adjust_vma fix seems to have made more likely.
Does anon_vma->lock nest inside or outside page_table_lock?  Inside, but
that's not obvious without a lock ordering list: instead of listing the
order here, update the list in filemap.c; but a separate patch because
that's less urgent and more likely to get wrong or provoke controversy.
(Could do it with anon_vma lock after dropping page_table_lock, but
a long comment explaining why some code is safe suggests it's not.)
