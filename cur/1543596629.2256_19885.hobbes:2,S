Subject: [PATCH] fix compile error in imsttfb.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As it currently stands, drivers/video/imsttfb.c will give a compile
error if FBCON_HAS_CFB32 is defined.  This patch fixes that.
There used to be a declaration of `i' which was only used if
FBCON_HAS_CFB32 was defined.  I suspect that somebody was compiling
without FBCON_HAS_CFB32 and saw an unused variable warning from gcc
and decided to take out the declaration.  This patch will avoid that
warning.
Linus, please apply.
Paul.
