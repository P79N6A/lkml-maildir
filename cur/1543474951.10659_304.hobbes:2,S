Hi folks,
Just had a crack compiling pre4. Compiling ntfs either as a module or
within the kernel causes it to choke. The error compiling as a module is
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 
-fomit-f
rame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -m
align-functions=2 -DCPU=686 -DMODULE -DNTFS_IN_LINUX_KERNEL
-DNTFS_VERSION=\"990
102\"  -c -o inode.o inode.c
inode.c: In function `ntfs_decompress_run':
inode.c:421: `ntfs_s16' undeclared (first use this function)
inode.c:421: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
inode.c:421: for each function it appears in.)
inode.c:423: `ntfs_s32' undeclared (first use this function)
make[2]: *** [inode.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/fs/ntfs'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_ntfs] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/fs'
make: *** [_mod_fs] Error 2
Also has anyone managed to get the console drivers page in the make 
xconfig to allow them to select the Mach64 display - it is blackened to
suggest it is selectable, however, I am unable to select either yes or no.
Seems when the make xconfig is completed, a number of WARNING - broken
Config.in! CONFIG_xxxxxx was not declared! - not being much of a hacker, I
am not sure how relevant this is.
Hope that's of some help
Simeon
