Subject: hotmail not dealing with ECN

Just curious if others have noticed that hotmail is unable to deal with
ECN and wondering if this is a standard that should be encouraged, as in
should I tell hotmail that perhaps they should look into supporting it, or
should I not waste my breath and echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn?
thanks
