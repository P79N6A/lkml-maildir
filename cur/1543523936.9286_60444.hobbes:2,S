This is true, he is off on the octet issue. But since his subnet was on octet
boundary so it got things confused. The rules he refered to is valid however
for the examples he gave _GIVEN_ that you do not run CIDR in your network
(that is, on your routers).

RFC 1122 may feel obsolete, but it is still labeled standard.
RFC 1518 is labeled proposed standard
RFC 2050 is BCP, but covers INTERNET REGISTRY IP ALLOCATION GUIDELINES and only
         suggest CIDR, not specify it as standard. It does not replace
	 RFC 1518.
BCP was invented to supply a way of endorsed practice while keeping it out of
the standard process. The CIDR spec is in for the standard track and has yeat
to become standard, until that is the case RFC 1122 does apply and actually is
standard. So, RFC 2050 provides the BCP for IP Allocation guidelines and is
using the framework set up by the CIDR RFC's but the CIDR RFC's does not yeat
overshadows the statements in RFC 1122 if you read things strictly.
You are however correct in that everyone is using CIDR and everyone should be
using CIDR. So, for the applicability to the Linux kernel you are infact
correct.
Cheers,
Magnus
