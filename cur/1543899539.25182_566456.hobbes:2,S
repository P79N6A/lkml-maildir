I understand there's no guaranteed scheduling with either timers or
workqueues, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the quantitative
difference when it's so relevant.
Are there any hard numbers on this?

Yes, because you'll now need 4-5 samples to reasonably estimate
something like angular velocity, and 100ms are no longer negligible.

Sounds good, then. It's a bit of a hack, but the benefits are well
worth it (if we can resolve the scheduling issue).
