I had thought Andrew asked people to do it at one point.  Could have
been someone else, I suppose.  Ah, it was Andrea Arcangeli.
At the time, it seemed more people were doing it.  I guess not though.
Or there really aren't many people running the latest -mm.  It *is*
quite a hassle.  I only do it because I'm crazy. :)
I think klive is a good idea for tracking kernel testing.  Perhaps
mentioning it here again will get more people running it.
I suppose that someone could try to estimate usage by counting patch
downloads off kernel.org.
