You mean the code DOESN'T normalize the signal to the total energy 
first?!?!? YEEP!
The very FIRST thing you do is compute the total signal energy in the 
sample period, trivially reject if Etotal < MinETotal, then normalize 
all other signal energies to Etotal - that is a basic tenant of DSP.

I think we may have the test cases as WAVs at work, and I think they are 
freely distributable - I'll kick a reminder to my work account off to 
check later today.
