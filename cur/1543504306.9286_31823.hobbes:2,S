Hi folks,
Thanks for the help with my last problem.  The book "Linux Device Drivers"
is in the mail and shall become my bible shortly :)
I have another short question -- is there ANY way to open/read/write
to a file from a kernel routine?  Again, excuse my lack of knowledge
on the subject.  What I mean to ask is that I will have a
buffer kmalloc'd in the kernel and I will want to read some data into
it from a file from, say, inside a system call routine.  Can this be done
at all?
sys_read calls the the filesystem's read function, which uses
copy_to_user (since it assumes it is invoked from user space through
a system call).  There may be other problems, as well.
Thank you.
Stan
