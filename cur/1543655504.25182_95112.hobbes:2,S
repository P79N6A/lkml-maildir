 HAVE A ECS K7VMM motherboard with a Geforce
4 mx 420. pctel modem. 
I just got Redhat linux 8.0 from the redhat linux 8 bible 
book. I booted off the cd and I have tried all the install 
types with no go.
When I boot up of the cd to the installer

Then it stop anf hangs.
Here is the last three lines.
