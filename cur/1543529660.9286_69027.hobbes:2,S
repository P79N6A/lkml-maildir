Hi Tim, Alan.
 >>>	alias ls='ls -F'

 >> alias make='echo banana'
 >> make bzImage
 >> That doesnt work either ..
Is that really a fair comparison? I know quite a few people who
use the alias I quoted, along with several others. Quite a common
alias for the above command on Linux systems is...
	alias ls='ls --color=auto -FG'
...but it's only the -F option that appears to cause any
problems.
 >> Perhaps we should use /bin/ls ?
My reading of that file is that it tries to use whichever version
of each command is nearest in the path, and unless I'm wrong, the
`make` command does not respect aliases, but does respect the
PATH variable, and it was for this reason that none of the
commands therein use paths. I tried to keep that behaviour.
Personally, I'd strip out the PATH= line therein and use the one
in the environment precicely to deal with this point, as most
people will be using the same path for everything else as for
compiling.

I've checked now, and indeed it can't work as written, but the
following alternative diff does exactly what was intended and has
been verified through long years of use. This is the variant I
was actually using:

The key to it doing what is required are the brackets, which
cause the enclosed to be run in a separate subshell and thus
insulate it from the calling environment.
I wasn't on my development box when I wrote the first quoted
version, and was writing from memory, for which I sincerely
apologise...

Probably a better idea would be to provide both.

It could also prevent the script from producing the correct
answers in some cases, so I would suggest basing a replacement
on the application of the above diff to the original version.

Very true.
Best wishes from Riley.
