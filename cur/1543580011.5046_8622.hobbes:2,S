What is the difference?
I can't think of any difference between:
  #define printk(format, args...) ((int) 0)
and:
  static inline int printk_inline (void) { return 0; }
  #define printk(format, args...) (printk_inline ())
If you wanted to be fully compatible in the sense of evaluating the
printk arguments, in case those have side effects, there would be:
  #define printk(format, args...) ((0 , ## args), (int) 0)
By the way, CONFIG_NO_PRINTK or CONFIG_DISABLE_PRINTK would be better
names.  CONFIG_PRINTK suggests that enabling that option enabled printk.
enjoy,
