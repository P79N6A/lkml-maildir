note that the scenario you describe is not possible, because
set_cpus_allowed() will wait for the migration thread to do its work - so
the put_task_struct can never come before the last use of the task
structure. See the 'down(&req.sem)' in set_cpus_allowed(), and the
up(&req->sem) in migration_thread().
