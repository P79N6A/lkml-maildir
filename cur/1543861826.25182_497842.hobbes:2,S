  Nope. I just say that unionfs should do some reasonable precautions so
that it's not easy to screw it (especially not in a DOS way). If I have
a device, then it is usually accessible only to admin and so user cannot
usually do anything bad to e.g. ext3. On the other hand part of
namespace (that unionfs takes instead of a device) is often accessible to
user and so I'd expect it wouldn't be uncommon for a user to be able to
screw unionfs. Of course, you can say: In a reasonable setup, unioned
trees should not be accessible to ordinary user (e.g. their topmost
directory should have 000 permissions). I'm just not sure whether
an average admin will setup his union trees in this way...
