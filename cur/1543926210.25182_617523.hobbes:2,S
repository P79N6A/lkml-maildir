The above suggestion is actually not exactly the best way to do it...
First the naming..
A quick grep shows following usage today (in Kconfig files)
ARCH_HAS	51
ARCH_SUPPORTS	4
HAVE_ARCH	7
ARCH_HAS is the clear winner.
In the common Kconfig file do:
config FOO
	depends on ARCH_HAS_FOO
	bool "bla bla" 
config ARCH_HAS_FOO
	def_bool n
In the arch specific Kconfig file in a suitable place do:
config SUITABLE_OPTION
	select ARCH_HAS_FOO
The naming of ARCH_HAS_ is fixed and shall be:
ARCH_HAS_<config option it will enable>
Only a single line added pr. architecture.
And we will end up with a (maybe even commented) list of trivial selects.
Sorry for providing late feedback on this!
