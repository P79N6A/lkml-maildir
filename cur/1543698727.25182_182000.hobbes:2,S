Yeah, the same reason that XFS, NUMA, etc are derived works from Unix
since they must include Unix header files.
What, maybe there are no inline functions there? No problem. SCO could
make stuff like spinlocks inline. And suddenly you are derived works
now.
I just don't see how this actually works as you said.
