A new version of plugsched is available for 2.6.10-rc1-mm4
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/plugsched/2.6.10-rc1-mm4/
Mainly this is a resync and cleanup.
The only new feature is the addition of the first in a family of 
minimalist schedulers: minisched
Minisched is a uniprocessor only scheduler that has support for the real 
time scheduling policies SCHED_RR, and SCHED_FIFO, with only very simple 
RR scheduling for SCHED_NORMAL. It is designed for use in an environment 
that mainly uses real time scheduling and wishes minimum overhead.
Microsched and nanosched are also planned. Microsched will have no 
support for real time tasks and have simple RR scheduling for 
SCHED_NORMAL. Nanosched will have no priority support at all.
A non-mm version is planned in the not too distant future...
After a hint from Peter I've trimmed the version number to only 7 digits 
(datestamp + release that date) :P
Cheers,
Con
