You know we're far from consensus on that one. Yes, the lookup part is
cleaner, no argument there. But it's also cleaner to manage persistence of
permissions, etc., on a real file system. You'll have a hard time arguing
that. Sure, you can do it, but we can also do cached lookups. Both are
hacks. However the lookup hack is invisible to the user and probably a bit
less complicated than managing a virtual filesystem.
The third and final piece, dealing with dynamic device creation is
solvable with a user-space component. Which, if all other things were
equal, would be the preferred approach simply because it's that much less
code in the kernel.
Personally, I think devpts and procfs should be replaced with userfs-type
drivers wrapping sysctl for pretty much the same reasons.
