Part of the motivation here is to fix heisenbugs.  If I knew where they 
were, I'd be posting patches for them.  Unlike most bugs, where we want 
to expose them as obviously as possible, these can be extremely 
difficult to track down, and are often due to people assuming that the 
atomic_* operations have the same semantics they've historically had. 
Remember that until recently, all SMP architectures except s390 (which 
very few kernel developers outside of IBM, Red Hat, and SuSE do much 
work on) had volatile declarations for atomic_t.  Removing the volatile 
declarations from i386 and x86_64 may have created heisenbugs that won't 
manifest themselves until GCC 6.0 comes out and people start compiling 
kernels with -O5.  We should have consistent semantics for atomic_* 
operations.
The other motivation is to reduce the need for the barriers used to 
prevent/fix such problems which clobber all your registers, and instead 
force atomic_* operations to behave in the way they're actually used. 
After the (resubmitted) patchset is merged, we'll be able to remove a 
whole bunch of barriers, shrinking our source and our binaries, and 
improving performance.
