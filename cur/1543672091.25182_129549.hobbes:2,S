I don't really get it, but I could be a bit braindead now.  I still don't
understand how the 0-16MB addresses are considered 'unjumpable' using the
ASCII string stack-smashing exploit.
IIRC, x86 ints have the high-order byte _last_ (ie the fourth byte).
What's to stop someone from, say, smashing a buffer (and consequently
return-address) on the stack using something like {0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00}
which is really address '65793' in base-10.  The above is a valid ASCII
string (3 1's followed by a NUL) which could conceivably end up on the
stack as the result of an errant strcpy() or gets() or whatever...
Clearly this address is less than 16MB, so then it must be possible to
jump to memory below 16MB.
Am I missing something??
