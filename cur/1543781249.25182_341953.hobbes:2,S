Latest version of linux vserver source: 100K bzipped
Latest version of linux-jail: 34K uncompressed
To build a virtual network device requires code for the device, code
for routing the device
in the kernel, some way to tell the router that this machine is hosted
through the host
machine's ethernet card, and control of which processes use which
network devices.
Way too much work for something intended to be simple and have essentially no
overhead.  All this work only gets jailed processes the ability to use
127.0.0.1.
The rest I can already do with eth0:1 and the specs for jail(2) from BSD.
