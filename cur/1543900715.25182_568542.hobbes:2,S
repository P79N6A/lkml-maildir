Thanks for the analysis.
I guess at some point it would make sense to model the whole thing in spin or 
similar and find even the last race. Anyone interested? @)

I suspect the right fix is to get rid of collect_tscs(). 
One possible way would be to get the TSCs from the mce_log table
before the synchronization instead of asking the CPUs.
Or switch it over to the NMI supporting RCU that was recently posted.

The problem with a ring buffer is that it would lose old entries; but 
for machine checks you really want the first entries because
the later ones might be just junk.
