  It can be just declared to be valid -- that additional forks can be
placed anywhere in the file after the first segment.

  This is why to deal with that kind of data it should be opened as forks
only -- this can't be made backward-compatible.

  Probably this is what it will end up with -- that files that contain
forks will have very limited backward compatibility (if read directly they
start from what is supposed to be the first fork/stream, and by reading
the whole file one can precisely find where the first fork ends), and
everything else is guaranteed to work only if all files that contain forks
opened separately for all forks. I assumed that the goal to preserve all
forks in often used trivial operations that are now nondestructive or
round-trip-safe (copying, cinpressing/uncompressing, archiving, accessing
over NFS, transferring files over ftp/http/...) is primary, and allowing
various kinds of messing with file content is less important.
