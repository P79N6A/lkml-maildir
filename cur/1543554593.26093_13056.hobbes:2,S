Each driver's entry in Config.in should be dependent on its
CONFIG_{ISA,EISA,PCI,SBUS,...} defines that indicate what buses are
defined on this particular architecture.  Eventually, DaveM and other
Sparc users will be able to directly source drivers/net/Config.in, and
be presented with the correct list of net drivers given their selected
bus(es).  Ditto for ARM.  Ditto for x86.  Etc.
Disabling code by making global var 'EISA_bus' unconditionally zero was
just an added bonus.  Helps a tiny bit with embedded platforms.

Agreed, for the most part.  If you know for sure you don't have an EISA
machine, you can now disable CONFIG_EISA.  IMHO ideally one should be
able to eliminate code that is useless on all but a small subset of
working machines.
