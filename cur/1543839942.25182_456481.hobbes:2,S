RT - yes, multithreaded - unsure. Witness how squid manages to
serve hundreds of simultaneous streams using just a single process.
Multithreading seems cool on the first glance and it is easier to code
than clever O_NONBLOCK/select/poll/etc stuff. However,
on single-CPU boxes, which are still a majority, multithreading
just incurs context switching penalty. It cannot magically
make CPU do more work in a unit of time.
