Sorry, Firmware is also 7.5.2 per the web page (try to keep driver and
firmware in sync so I forget to specify that sometimes).  The
configuration is 8 drives being software raid'd into 2 4drive raid5's.
When this was built we went this route as we were told that the raid5
implementation for the 3ware was slower than the software.  We didn't
have alot of time to test this theory and prove it wrong unfortunately.
We need the space of raid5 more than the reduancancy of mirroring.  
What else can I tell you?
