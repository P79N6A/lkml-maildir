Subject: [patch 0/9] Shared ia32 syscall table
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch series updates i386 and x86_64 so they share
the same ia32 syscall table.  UML already uses the i386
table and is updated to use the new shared table as well.
This series does not convert unistd.h.
Tested by building and booting UML, i386 and x86_64
(x86_64 was booted with 32-bit userspace.)
All three archs should work at all intermediate steps but
that was not tested.
