     This doesn't affect your main question, but you are using the
wrong syntax for sudo.  The -u option takes a username/uid argument.
Your command is telling sudo to run bash as user man, who doesn't
exist.  sudo is normally run by a user (not root) who is listed in the
file /etc/sudoers.
     Your sudo problems don't appear to be related to your suid
problems.
Bob
