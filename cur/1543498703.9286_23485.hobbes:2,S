I'm not sure you do need to know which RAID mode you're in.  All you
need to do is know where to load a block from, and what to do with it
when you get it (in the case of RAID-[2345]).
The point you make about `how does the boot loader know that one of the
disks has failed' is well taken though -- how can it know that disc
3 has failed and has been replaced by a new disc with no data on it,
so it should not load any blocks from disc 3?

how much space is left?  Recovering from a dud disc should only be a
matter of performing an XOR over a block.  It's up to the kernel to
recreate the missing disc, of course.

that would work.

So do you approve of the idea of adding an index to the call to allow the
application to find out about all possible real blocks which contain
this data?

I think people would prefer to just make their root partition a raid-1
device and have lilo do the right thing.  I don't think it adds too
much complexity to support raid-1.  As I indicated, I thought the
raid-[2345] support might be a little over the top :-)

Hehe.  I once developed on a machine with 8 IDE drives...
