What's new:
Kernel profiling with gprof now works.  See 
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/um
l/profiling.html for details.
I implemented a network device, so networking now works.  I've tested ping, 
ftp, and telnet in both directions (although telnetting in loses output pretty 
quickly), and http going out (with lynx).  Among other things, this makes it 
possible to set up and test network services virtually before inflicting them 
on real machines.
Kernel test coverage with gcov works as well.  See 
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/uml/gcov.html
 for details.  If anyone is 
interested in starting up a coverage test suite project for the kernel, this 
would be a good place to start.
As usual, everything is available at

tml.
