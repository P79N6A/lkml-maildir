HI!
Is there any hints to get this UDMA133 chip to work. Currently it seems to 
reported work over WIP (WorkInProgress), but on my onboard ABIT KR7A-RAID i 
get DMA disabled message and all hardisks on HPT372 IDE channel are "lost" 
after that.
Kernel is 2.4.19-pre3
PS. Hints like "Download binary linux drivers from HighPoint homepage" are 
not hints for me :P
