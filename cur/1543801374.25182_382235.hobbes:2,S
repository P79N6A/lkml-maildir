Hi Wu,
What is the purpose of scanning large chunks at a time?
Some drawbacks that I can think of by doing that:
- zone->lru_lock will be held for much longer periods, resulting in
decreased responsiveness and possibly slowdowns.
- if the task doing the scan is uncapable of certain operations, for
instance IO, dirty pages will be moved back to the head of the inactive
list in much larger batches then they were before. This could hurt
reclaim in general.
What were the results of this change? Particularly contention on the
lru_lock on medium-large SMP systems.
Thanks!
