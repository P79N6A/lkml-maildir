Well, I observed the hanging select with SuSE kernel 2.6.8-24.11, so it is
fairly current. I'm seeing this problem with an Option Wireless UMTS data
card. This card is interesting. It is a CardBus card that presents a USB
OHCI hub to the system. Internally it claims to plug in a USB serial
connector. If you issue a RESET AT command, the kernel tells me that the
USB device virtually plugged into the hub got disconnected. A few seconds
later the gets plugged in again. At this point I would have to reopen the
tty. Unfortunately the disconnect event does not propagate to the
application. I could poke the tty to see whether it is still really there,
but this seems quite hackish.
Regards
