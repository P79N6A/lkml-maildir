In attacking an application every bit of known data can be used in an
exploit.  Be it something as simple as having a predetermined value at a
certain point in the program since it loaded a file descriptor into a
register.
But what I'm mostly thinking about is the case where I/O could be
redirected.  The intruding program could call dup2() and suddenly the
program wanting to write a password to disk could be directed to send it
over a socket.  One could imagine countless such attacks.
I don't say such an attack exists today.  But this is no reason to not
implement these extra security measures.  The cost of a randomized star
base (offset from 2^30) should be zero.
