I have no opinion about where the bug is (input or leds or elsewhere) - 
my only opinion is that the kernel must not stay build-broken - and the 
discussion with Dmitry was about that.
I'm not interested in trivial patches as those issues are much more 
efficiently handled by the person who maintains that code (i.e. Dmitry) 
and who intimately knows the dependencies and expectations of that code. 
That's why i sent the bugreport and patch to Dmitry.
