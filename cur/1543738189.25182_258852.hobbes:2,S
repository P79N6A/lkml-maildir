Here is the combined patch with Andrew's hunk added.
I guess it doesn't _really_ matter which gets tested, but this
one is probably the preferred way to go because it doesn't even
wake up kswapd for empty zones. Andrew, do you agree?
I guess it should get into -bk pretty soon if it passes testing.
It is fairly easy to see the failure cases that are fixed (and
hopefully it doesn't domino yet another latent bug :P).
