Ok, the *fix* looks real enough, but it seems that you have done your line 
splitting with a word processor rather than with a source code editor:
> +	return ata_host_activate(host, platform_get_irq(pdev, 0),

Please don't do things like this. Splitting up expressions across two 
lines just to make the line length come out "right" is silly.
So do the
	"pp_info ? pp_info->irq_flags : 0"
expression on one line.
And if it means that the line is longe rthan 80 characters, then so be it. 
It's ok. It's still more readable than the alternative.
