Yes, that's my point. The second argument (size) is virtually always
sizeof() whereas the first one (n) is sometimes a variable. GCC
currently does not optimize away the division when n is not a
constant.
Looking at 2.6.13-rc6-mm1, we have roughly 15 callers with the first
parameter being a variable. The compiler would be able to get rid of
one comparison and division instruction for each of these so looks
like we could shave off some more bytes...
