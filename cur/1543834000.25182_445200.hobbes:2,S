Hi,
I think they had to begin sometime earlier in 2.6.17 - I've plenty of them with
every (re)make on ver. 2.6.17.4, but because it is workink I stopped to look at
them. I'm very surprised nobody answered you, as if it was something uncommon.
If I could remember well, they are not present when full kernel is built - only
when some drivers are changed and rebuild. I'll try to look at it again later.
