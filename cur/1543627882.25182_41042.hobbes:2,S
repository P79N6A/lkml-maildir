Could I suggest that this code not be part of EVMS, but that
you implement it as a library within the core kernel?  Lots of
stuff is going to need BIO splitting - software RAID, ataraid,
XFS, etc.  May as well talk with Jens, Martin Petersen, Arjan,
Neil Brown.  Do it once, do it right...

You're not the only one...  That is placeholder code which
Jens plans to complete at a later time.

Makes sense.

Hopefully, once scsi_merge is able to handle the allocation
failure correctly, we won't have a problem any more.
As a temp thing I guess you could increase the size of that
mempool.
