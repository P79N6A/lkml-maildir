That's not a CPU, that's an architecture.  I hope you
understand there are very big differences between different
members of the x86 family and you don't compare 2.95 on a
Pentium class CPU to 3.x on an Opteron or 4.x on a Pentium4
or something like that.

That is not "for size only".  Please read again.
A 70% speed decrease is something that should be at least
investigated, even if then perhaps it is decided GCC already
does the "right thing".

A few percent points slower is expected, 20% would be
explainable, but 70%?
-O2 and -Os are supposed to differ in _minor_ ways.  Such
a huge performance drop is unexpected.  If you file the PR,
feel free to blame me for reporting it at all.

Yes of course.  I'm just saying -Os is a pretty minor step
in the overall making-things-smaller game.  Leaving out XFS
helps a whole megabyte on my default target, for example.

Sure.  I don't think making -Os mean "as small as possible
in all cases" (or, rather, introducing a new option for that)
would help terribly much over the current -Os meaning -- a
few percent at most.  That's not to say that no such optimisations
are added anymore, but mostly they turn out not to decrease
speed at all and so are enabled at any -O level :-)
