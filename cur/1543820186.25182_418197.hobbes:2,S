Subject: Q: Why decreased performance on 2.6.17-rc2-gitX with dual cpu vs single cpu ?

tyan amd64 box with dual opteron 250
4GB ram
debian 64 bit os
It's running as a usenet gateway (2TB in & out roughly each day)
I recently installed munin to track more information.
I run 2.6.17-rc2-git4 in UP mode for 29 hours and then
switched to 2.6.17-rc2-git5 and enabled both cpu's (smp)
irqbalance is installed :
# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      55171    2161605    IO-APIC-edge  timer

Kernel config's, kern.log output of both kernels can
be found at: 
http://newsgate.newsserver.nl/kernel/
munin graphics:

I see in the munin graphics some idle time for the first 
time when both cpu's are enabled. But IO-Wait is also much
higher then in UP mode.
Any brilliant mind can explain to me what is happening here ?
i certainly don't get it !
