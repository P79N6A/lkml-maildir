I did a cvs up -D 2005-12-1, about 1.5 hours ago and it hadn't been
applied yet.

I'll resuck the whole thing.

Ok, that I can probably do.  Unforch, there is a miss-cue in that
file, rc4 says:
struct cx88_board cx88_boards[] = {
        [CX88_BOARD_UNKNOWN] = {
                .name           = "UNKNOWN/GENERIC",
                .tuner_type     = UNSET,
                .radio_type     = UNSET,
                .tuner_addr     = ADDR_UNSET,
                .radio_addr     = ADDR_UNSET,
                .input          = {{
                        .type   = CX88_VMUX_COMPOSITE1,
Note also that the .type = label has been changed.  I'm going to change
that line back to CX88_VMUX_TELEVISION, just for grins.
While the patch says:
@@ -569,6 +569,7 @@ struct cx88_board cx88_boards[] = {
                .radio_type     = UNSET,
                .tuner_addr     = ADDR_UNSET,
                .radio_addr     = ADDR_UNSET,
                .tda9887_conf   = TDA9887_PRESENT,
                .input          = {{
                        .type   = CX88_VMUX_TELEVISION,
                        .vmux   = 0,
And I've added that line from the patch to just above the ".input"
line, its rebuilding now.  And a cold reboot will test it, so I'll send
this first just to let you know not all is well in tv land.
