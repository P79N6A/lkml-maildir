I think this particular problem is fixed by the following patch to the
X driver:
--- synaptics.c.old	2005-07-10 00:09:02.000000000 +0200
+++ synaptics.c	2005-07-10 00:09:12.000000000 +0200

I think this CodingStyle violation is quite annoying, because it
prevents emacs from finding the beginning of the function. It should
be written like this:
static int atp_calculate_abs(int *xy_sensors, int nb_sensors, int fact)
