This assumes the implementation uses queues, one per 
priority level.
And even if it does, the process may be the only one with that
priority, making this a useless way of giving up "some time".
It'll still get rescheduled over and over and prevent
lower-priority processes from running.

The way I understand it, the scheduler doesn't "break".  You just
get a lot of useless busy waiting.
