Subject: [PATCH 3/4] ptrace: reintroduce __ptrace_detach() as a callee of ptrace_exit()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/686

No functional changes, preparation for the next patch.
Move the "should we release this child" logic into the separate handler,
__ptrace_detach().
