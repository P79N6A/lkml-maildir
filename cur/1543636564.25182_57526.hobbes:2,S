CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE works other way around. If you set CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE,
/dev/console can be displayed on your VTs (on your screen).
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE/CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE determines whether your VT can
be created at all - maybe _CONSOLE suffix is misleading - without
having at least one displaying device virtual terminals cannot be build.
I always thought that CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE cannot be unset, but
apparently it can...
And BTW, when such configuration worked for you last time? It does not
look to me like that it should ever work.
