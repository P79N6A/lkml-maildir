BSD's write ordering doesn't quite cut it because it doesn't preserve a
complete filesystem state.  But the following do:
  Auragen (ask Victor Yodaiken)
  Nirvana db (my previous work)

It's nice to know we're doing other people's work for them.  Oh, wait,
that's what we're supposed to do!  Just so long as they remember to put
some cookies back in the jar after they've munched on the ones they
like.

Soon, all of us will be having these brushes.  Patents are a fence
around Linux, trying to hold us in, keep us from using techniques newer
than 17 years old.  Of course, we can't accept that - it would be death
for us.  Um, I seem to recall Microsoft's Halloween II memo made special
note of exactly that point.

Yes, absolutely I am:
  
http://innominate.org/~phillips/tux2/
Tux2 coding is temporarily suspended until after I come back from
Atlanta (ALS) and Miami (Storage conference).  After that I'm raring to
go.  There are plenty of design notes to read in the tux2-dev mailing
list archives:
  
http://innominate.org/mailman/listinfo/tux2-dev
We *will* get through this NetApp thing in a satisfactory way, one way
or another.  In the meantime I'm really looking forward to fixing up
Tux2 for 2.4.0.  I have in mind a really great way to map the metadata
into the page cache - and even into linear memory - using Al Viro's
address_mapping machinery.  This will actually make the 2.4.0 code
cleaner than the 2.2.13 version and way more efficient.
