I have a 4 port Vista KVM from Rose Electronics, where hot key is a
single left control. That doesn't interfere as much.
I'm running 2.6.x on 2 machines, windows XP on a third.

Does your KVM also have keys on the kvm to switch? If so, does the
problem go away if you use those?
Otherwise, perhaps hack drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c (dunno if that is
the correct path) to log when a scroll-lock is received) and then throw
away that keypress?
Good luck,
Jurriaan
