the flip pointer method could be made to work if we had a NR_CPUS array
of 'current RCU pointer' values attached to the task - and that array
would be cleared if the task exits the read section. But this has memory
usage worries with large NR_CPUS. (full clearing of the array can be
avoided by using some sort of 'read section generation' counter attached
to each pointer)
