Let me state this once more: he is interested in _rough approximation_. It 
makes no sense to me to add this kind of fuzzy logic in the slab. Now, as 
the slab clearly cannot give a _precise number_ either, it shouldn't be 
added there.
But, if both of you really want to stick it in mm/slab.c, I guess I won't 
be too violently opposed to it. It just doesn't make any sense to me.
