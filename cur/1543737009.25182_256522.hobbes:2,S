They already had that, with the integer cookie representing the
directory ("/etc", in the example), as was a bit obvious, or else
returning the relative path ("hosts" in the example) wouldn't have
worked either.
That is, I was suggesting returning:
	{cookie-of-/etc,EVENT_MODIFY,inode-number-of-hosts-file}
instead of:
	{cookie-of-/etc,EVENT_MODIFY,"hosts"}
