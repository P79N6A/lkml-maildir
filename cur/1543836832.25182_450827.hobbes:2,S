It seems that the command line on x86_64 is being truncated during boot:
Bootdata ok (command line is root=/dev/sda1 ro profile=2 console=tty0 
console=ttyS0,57600 autobench_args: root=/dev/sda1 ABAT:1154470592 
profile=2)
[...]
Kernel command line: root=/dev/sda1 ro profile=2 console=tty0 
console=ttyS0,57600 autobench_args: root=/dev/sda1 ABAT:1154470592 profile=2
[...]
elm3b6:~# cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/sda1
This seems to be occuring around the parse_args area.
Will try and track it down.
