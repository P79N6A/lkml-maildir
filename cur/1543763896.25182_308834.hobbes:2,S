yes, it cures both problems (death on reboot and ALPS), in fact.  But I
must have *both* params.  nomux without usb-handoff causes all input
devices to fail.  Thanks goodness for ssh.  Anyway - I'm now running a
clean 2.6.11.6 kernel that *works*.

Yes, this should fix the death-on-reboot (why oh why can't the BIOS just
"do the right thing"), it still won't get me alps though.  For that I
need the nomux option - ie, a total different codepath than what that
patch attends to.  And it probably won't fix the keyboard problem.  This
sucks (don't get me wrong - I appreciate that my hardware is now
functioning properly - only things afaik that doesn't work now is the SD
card reader and suspend/hibernate and with ati-drivers there is not a
chance in hell that that'll ever work, neither of which is of critical
importance for me).

No external PS/2 port :).

Anything else that you would like me to try?

My thoughts exactly.  The same goes for gpm.
Thanks a lot for your time, patience and knowledge.
