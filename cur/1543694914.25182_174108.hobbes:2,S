| Changes since 2.6.0-test7-mm1:
| +devfs-initrd-fix.patch
| 
|  Fix initrd when devfs is in use
I casually followed the thread on this, is this a band-aid or a magic
spell of healing? Do you consider this a "real fix" for the various
problems people reported?
| +export-system_running.patch
| +might_sleep-early-bogons.patch
| 
|  Stomp all the early might_sleep() warnings.
Sort of the same question, were the warnings really bogus, or were
people just not doing the things which might cause a real error?
| +slab-leak-detector.patch
| +slab-leak-detector-tweaks.patch
| 
|  A slab debugging tool for finding memory leaks: do
| 
| 	echo "slab-name 0 0 0" > /proc/slabinfo
| 
|  and the kernel will inspect each live object in that cache and will print
|  out the code address from which the allocation was performed.
Neat!
| +parport_pc-resource-release-fix.patch
| 
|  Fix an oopsable resource leak in parport_pc.
I'll try my old parport ZIP drive (ppa) again this weekend.
| +ext3-latency-fix.patch
| 
|  Improved scheduling latency in ext3.
Did someone have measurements on this?
Compiling as I type.
