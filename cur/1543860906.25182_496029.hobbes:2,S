This is not supported, neither by radeonfb (patches or not) nor by
X.org. X1xxx cards have a new display engine and ATI refuses to provide
any specs for it.
Note: I wonder how much of that is related to M$ new Vista DRM that
basically forbids video or sound card vendors from providing specs or
doing open source or they get "revoked" and never get to see "HD"
content...
