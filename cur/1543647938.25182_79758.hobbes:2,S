Can you clarify the usage of the above?  Assuming the console cursor is
monochrome, half-height, and fontsize is 8x16, how would the structure
be filled up?
We will also need a field for the bit operation (xor, solid, trans, etc)
as suggested by Petr, at least for monochrome.
Finally, another field for the font bitmap that is overlying the cursor
may be needed.  Only for the console and a monochrome cursor.  This way,
the driver can manually do the bit operation if the hardware is
incapable of doing so.
If I'm to guess at the structure usage (in console):
set - which of the fbcursor fields have changed
enable - make cursor visible/invisible
hot - how will this be used?  
size - is this fontsize or the actual cursor size?
image - bitmap where all bits are set to 1?
mask - does this correlate with the shape of the cursor or with the
underlying font bitmap?
image and mask has the same dimensions (fbcursor.size)?
