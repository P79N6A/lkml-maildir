I don't see how it's any worse than giving them a choice of 3-4 preset
values.  Especially with the current defaults being given as the
if-in-doubt option :)
This is would also be a good reason to have a CONFIG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS
globally, ala what's in arch/ppc/Kconfig now.  If selected, you can pick
some 'user-unfriendly' options, and otherwise a default is picked for
you.
This is also a good argument for the TWEAKS stuff I talked about a while
ago, but haven't found the time yet to finish the dependancy stuff (it
works ala CONFIG stuff now, _except_ for a new TWEAK key).
