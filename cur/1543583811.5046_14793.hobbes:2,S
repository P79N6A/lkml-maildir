Hi,
I have recently started to use an USB cd toaster and have a little problem.
Writer is driven by usb-storage and scsi-cdrom and scsi-generic drivers.
Burning works fine.
The problem is that the usb-storage module spits so many info-debug
messages (even if I configured no debug in kernel config) that after
a cd burn I end up with a 25 MB file in /var/log/messages and other 25MB
in /var/log/kernel/info, so it fills my / partition.
If someone know a fast way to shut up usb-storage, I'll be gratefull.
If not, I will try to make a patch to enclose all that printk's into
#ifdef CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DEBUG.
