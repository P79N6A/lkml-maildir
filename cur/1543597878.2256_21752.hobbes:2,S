Yes, exactly, did you read my mind?  Page units are the natural quantum
of the time base for the whole mm.  When we clock all mm events according
to the (__alloc_page << order) timebase then lots of memory spikes are
magically transformed into smooth curves and it becomes immediately
obvious how much scanning we need to do at each instant.  Now, warning,
this is a major shift in viewpoint and I'll wager, unwelcome on this side
of the 2.5 split.  I'd be happy to work with you doing a skunkworks-type
proof-of-concept though.

I'll supply a cute, efficient filter that does what you're doing with the
rubberband with a little stronger theoretical basis, as soon as I wake up
again.  Or you can look for my earlier "Early flush with bandwidth
estimation" post.  (Try to ignore the incorrect volatile handling please.)
BTW, you left out an interesting detail: any performance measurements
you've already done.
