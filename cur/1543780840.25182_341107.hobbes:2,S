Huh? That's the problem.
X^16 + X^12 + X^5 + X^0 = 0x1021, not 0xa001
Also,
X^16 + X^15 + X^2 + X^0 = 0x8005, not 0x8408
Attached is a program that will generate a table of polynomials
for the conventional CRC lookup-table code. If you look at
the table in the kernel code, offset 1, you will see that
the polynomial is 0x1189. This corresponds to the CRC of
the value 1. It does not correspond to either your polynomials
or the ones documented on numerous web pages.

I think somebody just guessed and came up with "magic" because the

Right, but the hardware did that. I have no control over that. I
have to figure out if:
(1) It started with 0xffff or something else.
(2) It was inverted after.
(3) The result was byte-swapped.
With the "usual" CRC-16 that I used before, using the lookup-
table that is for the 0x1021 polynomial, hardware was found
to have inverted and byte-swapped, but started with 0xefde
(0x1021 inverted). Trying to use the in-kernel CRC, I was
unable to find anything that made sense.
