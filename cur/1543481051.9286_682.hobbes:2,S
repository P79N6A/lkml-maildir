I agree on most of your comments. Just to comment on two of them:

I don't know if the author wanted to stress, that Linux, unlike NT, is able
to properly support 64bit processors or if he refered to SMP capabilities.

From linux/fs/Config.in:
tristate 'NTFS filesystem support (read only)' CONFIG_NTFS_FS
if [ "$CONFIG_NTFS_FS" != "n" -a "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
  bool '   NTFS read-write support (experimental)' CONFIG_NTFS_RW
fi         
AFAIK, it really works, so the "experimental" rather means that it's not
tested to a degree we want filesystems to be tested and that it was not made
by studying internal NTFS docu, as it was not provided by M$.
