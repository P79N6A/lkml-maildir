With respect to your kernel-userspace API for xc3028, you made something
that seemed to be a dream: there's a consensus: not a single developer
believed that this is the better way; nobody seems that this is the
better approach.
So, or you are the only media developer with good sense in the face of
the Earth, or you're incapable of understand the obvious: you're wrong
with this approach. IMO, the answer is quite obvious.
