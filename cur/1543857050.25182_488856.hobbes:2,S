Following 3 patches try to implement the above.
Tested on a UP only after this incantation:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/wakeup_timing
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_user_triggered
and for half of tests:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_freerunning
or
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_freerunning
.
