	I have the same problem, I've only tried 2.2.0pre1-ac2 and -ac3. I
	wonder if it's SCSI related, though both machines here have SCSI
	compiled in, only one has a card, HD (sda) and MO (sdb).
SCSI related only in the sense that the patches 2.2.0pre1
does things intended for IDE disks and meaningless for SCSI disks.
(In fact also meaningless for IDE, but that is another story.
At least for IDE there is no Oops.)
Revert ide.c changes to avoid the Oops.
