Right, so what I was saying was: if you reset all regular caps on sgid
exec, anyone can trivially reset all regular caps by creating a sgid
program (users are always members of a great many groups so "finding
another gid to hijack" is trivial).  So CAP_REG_SXID needs to be off
all the time, so we lose again.
But I'll make this a securebit ("unsanitized sxid"), with the behavior
you advertise as default (0).

I am now completely convinced the patch will never be merged. :-(
Linux will have useless caps forever...
