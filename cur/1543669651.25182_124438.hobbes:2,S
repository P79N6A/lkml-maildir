Well, if you're going to do this, at least make it possible to tie all
the sd devices to a single major (i.e. the numeric compatibility layer
simply maps to the new single major scheme internally).  It would also
be nice for numeric compatibility to be a compile time option too...
It's also possible that SCSI may not be the only consumer of such a
compatibility layer (IDE also has multiple majors), so it may be
worthwhile putting it somewhere more globally useful (like
fs/block_dev.c)
