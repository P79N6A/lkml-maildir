Karsten,
so today I added 4 more drives to my hpt374, tried 2.5.47-ac6 and works 
flawlessy...
Sorry, but I can't try 2.4-ac-latest, cause of missing xfs support.
There are some things you could be bitten with:
My Distribution (Debian) only ships with device names up to /dev/hdh ...
So, by default, you'll see the drives attached to ide4(hdi,j) and to 
ide5(hdk,l) in the kernel messages, but you can't use 'em...
You have to make device nodes yourself:
mknod /dev/hd* b MAJOR MINOR
where:
hdi : 56 0
hdi1: 56 1
...
hdj : 56 64
hdj1: 56 65
...
hdk : 57 0
hdk1: 57 1
...
hdl : 57 64
hdl1: 57 65
...
see Documentation/devices.txt in the linux kernel sources.
hope this helps for ya!
Good Luck
CHristian
