You have roughly 2 GB of dynamic address-space avaliable to each
task (stuff that's not the kernel and not the runtime libraries).
You can easily have 500 tasks, even RedHat out-of-the-box creates
about 60 tasks. That's 1,000 GB of potential swap-space required
to support this. This is not beyond the capabilites of a 32-bit
machine with a fast front-side bus and fast I/O (like wide SCSI).
Some persons tend to forget that 32-bit address space is available
to every user, some is shared, some is not. A reasonable rule-of-
thumb is to provide enough swap-space to duplicate the address-
space of every potential task.
Cheers,
