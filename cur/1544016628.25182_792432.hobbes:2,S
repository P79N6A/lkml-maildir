Subject: [patch 2.6.29-rc] regulator: add get_status()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/15/40

From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Based on previous LKML discussions:
 * Update docs for regulator sysfs class attributes to highlight
   the fact that all current attributes are intended to be control
   inputs, including notably "state" and "opmode" which previously
   implied otherwise.
 * Define a new regulator driver get_status() method, which is the
   first method reporting regulator outputs instead of inputs.
   It can report on/off and error status; or instead of simply
   "on", report the actual operating mode.
For the moment, this is a sysfs-only interface, not accessible to 
regulator clients.  Such clients can use the current notification
interfaces to detect errors, if the regulator reports them.
