IIRC, that patch was to force a SCHED_RR (or SCHED_FIFO) process to
give up the CPU if it calls sched_yield(), and allow a SCHED_OTHER
process to run.
If this is the same patch, then it should be rejected. The premise is
flawed. POSIX.4 states that RT processes will always run in preference
to SCHED_OTHER. A RT process which does sched_yield() *should not*
give up it's CPU to a SCHED_OTHER process.
