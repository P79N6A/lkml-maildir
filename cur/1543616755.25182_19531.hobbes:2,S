Ingo,
I like the new scheduler. It seems like the timeslice macros in sched.h 
could be more straighforward - i.e. instead of
#define PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
((( (MAX_USER_PRIO-1-USER_PRIO(p))*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE) + \
MAX_USER_PRIO-1) / MAX_USER_PRIO) + MIN_TIMESLICE)
#define RT_PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
((( (MAX_RT_PRIO-(p)-1)*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE) + \
MAX_RT_PRIO-1) / MAX_RT_PRIO) + MIN_TIMESLICE)
why not
#define PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
(MAX_TIMESLICE - 
(USER_PRIO(p)/(MAX_USER_PRIO-1))*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE))
#define RT_PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
(MAX_TIMESLICE - (p/(MAX_RT_PRIO-1))*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE))
The second way seems simpler to me, and really illustrates what you are 
doing in a more straightforward manner.
I also cleaned up some of the comments. The sched.h diff between the H6 
version of the scheduler applied to 2.4.18-pre3 and vanilla 2.4.18-pre3 
follows: (Note that I changed the min and max timeslices to 20 and 100 
for my own use.)
