As said even if all the above is audited, it _can_ break over time,
while it wouldn't break with RTAI/rtlinux even if you infinite loop and
hang in there.

The "case by case" appoach is the problem, so that you plug an usb
gadget in, and your robot breaks and damages stuff. That would never
happen with RTAI/rtlinux. (ok, a bad driver could corrupt memory anyway,
but introducing a latency problem is much easier than introducing a
memory corruption)

Don't change topic, you said local_irq_disable isn't smp safe in
drivers...

You're the one spreading FUD that preempt-RT is as good as RTAI, and
even worse than local_irq_disable isn't used in drivers or not safe to
use in smp.
