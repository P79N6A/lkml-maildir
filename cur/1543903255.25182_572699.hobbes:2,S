Sure, I don't mind doing that at all.
Hm, it looks like Randy added this back in September last year with:
	commit d8c7649e99e4b081b624aefe1e77caa30b53cb18
	Author: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
	Date:   Fri Sep 29 01:58:55 2006 -0700
	    [PATCH] kernel/params: driver layer error checking
	    Check driver layer return values in kernel/params.c
	    Signed-off-by: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
	    Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
	    Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
(wow, I love git and the signed-off-tree for things like this, it's
trivial to find this information out.)
So I'm guessing he was trying to catch something specific here.
Randy, any objection to changing that BUG_ON to a printk warning instead
telling the user exactly what needs to be fixed and that the system is
now going to be unstable when any module is unloaded?
thanks,
