Actually, Herbert, it turns out this case should be OK.
Look a level or two higher, at __splice_segment(), it even has a
comment :-)
--------------------
	do {
		unsigned int flen = min(*len, plen);
		/* the linear region may spread across several pages  */
		flen = min_t(unsigned int, flen, PAGE_SIZE - poff);
		if (spd_fill_page(spd, page, flen, poff, skb, linear))
			return 1;
		__segment_seek(&page, &poff, &plen, flen);
		*len -= flen;
	} while (*len && plen);
--------------------
That code should work and do what we need.
