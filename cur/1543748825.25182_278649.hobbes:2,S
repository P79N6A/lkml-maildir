These patches are obsoleted by the new patchset by Jeff Mahoney that
adds a S_PRIVATE flag to i_flags, changes reiserfs to use this flag,
changes the security framework to not call the security modules on such
private inodes, and makes one change to SELinux to deal with its
handling of inodes allocated prior to initial policy load and superblock
security setup.  So I believe that you can drop all of these patches.
