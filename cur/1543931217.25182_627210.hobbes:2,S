The difference between blk_end_request() and __blk_end_request() is
whether the queue lock is held or not when end_that_request_last()
is called.
It's not relevant to the status of the request (error or not).
I'm using __blk_end_request() here and I think it's sufficient, because:
  o end_that_request_last() must be called with the queue lock held
  o ub_end_rq() calls end_that_request_last() without taking
    the queue lock in itself.
    So the queue lock must have been taken outside ub_end_rq().
But, if ub is calling end_that_request_last() without the queue lock,
it is a bug in the original code and we should use blk_end_request()
to fix that.
Does that answer satisfy you?
Thanks,
