Lots of things aren't doable with the current timer API, hence all the
recent work on dynamic tick.  This driver would actually be a perfect
test for the dynamic tick system as your PC speaker driver basically
implements its own dynamic tick mechanism.  Just replace all the PIT
reprogramming with itimers.
