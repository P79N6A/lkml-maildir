That's it's own task, it must make sure not to commit suicide. I forgot
about that.

It may not be blocked by a random RT task iff the RT task is supposed to
be OOM-killed. Therefore it *MUST* run at the highest priority and be
locked into the RAM.
It *SHOULD* be run at boot time, too, just in case it's needed early.

You're trying to avoid it in order to let admins try other ranking
algorhithms (at least that's what I read). The module approach seems to be
flexible enough to do that, and it avoids the mentioned issues. If you
really want a userspace daemon, it can be controled by a module.-)
I 'm thinking of something like that:
[X] support stacking of OOM killer ranking algorhythms
[X] Task blessing OOM filter
[X] Userspace OOM ranking daemon
[X] Default OOM killer ranking
-vs-
[ ] support stacking of OOM killer ranking algorhythms
( ) Userspace OOM ranking daemon
(o) Default OOM killer ranking

Exceptions prove the rule, and destroy the battle plan.
