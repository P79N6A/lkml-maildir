Indeed, but that's a good thing because people often want/need
more features or bugfixes than what's in the standard kernel.

ext3 has been in Alan's kernels for a while now, you can
always upgrade to a new -ac kernel and keep using ext3.
Also, the fact that ext3 isn't available in 2.4 -linus
doesn't sound like a good reason to not make this useful
feature available to the users of Linux distributions ;)
