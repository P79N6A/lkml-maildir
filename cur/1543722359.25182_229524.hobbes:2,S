I think this structure should be defined in a header in include/linux,
probably <linux/pci.h>.  We could create a new <linux/msi.h> include
but I don't think it's worth it at this point.  Also I don't see any
reason to use bitfields or userspace types like __u32 (since no
userspace code is going to use this include file).  I would just
declare the type as
struct msix_entry {
       u16 vector;
       u16 entry;
};
  > +int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev *dev, u32 *entries, int nvec)
Since this function takes an array of struct msix_entry in its entries
parameter, I think entries should be declared as struct msix_entry *
rather than just u32 *.  That is, I would write the prototype as
int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev *dev, struct msix_entry *entries,
		    int nvec);
  > +		j = (entries + i)->entry;
  > +		(entries + i)->vector = vector;
Finally, this is a nitpick, but this just looks odd to me.  Why not
write this as
                j = entries[i].entry;
                entries[i].vector = vector;
By the way, I have MSI working with my device with this patch
applied.  I am getting ready to test MSI-X, which is why I have
comments about the MSI-X API now.
