We really should find a way to fix that.  Especially if we want all the
distributors to enable the connector in their builds (we do).
What happened to the idea of sending an on/off message down the netlink
socket?

This can be static const, which will save some stack and cycles.

Do we really need to memset the whole thing?

`seq' needs a lock to protect it.  Or use atomic_add_return(), maybe.

scnprintf() would be more appropriate here, even though it should be a "can't
happen".

`msg' is only 84 bytes and do_fork() has a shallow call graph.  Make `msg'
a local?
