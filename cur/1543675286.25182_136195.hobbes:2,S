This is a bit like "arch/foo/kernel/irq.c should be common code".  The
patch exists, but is late, intrusive and only a cleanup.
However I think experience teaches us that we should push ahead with
changes like this because not doing it creates more aggregate pain than
doing it.
So yes, please send me your latest and we'll try to get it underway.
