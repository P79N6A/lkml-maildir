yeah, randconfig generated this:
  CONFIG_PCI=y
  CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS=y
  # CONFIG_PCI_GOMMCONFIG is not set
  # CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT is not set
  # CONFIG_PCI_GOANY is not set
  CONFIG_PCI_BIOS=y
which forced the PCI code into the BIOS access method on this otherwise 
modern system. I disable some of the really-known-to-be-broken .config 
options in randconfig - but i still bravely keept CONFIG_GO_PCIBIOS in 
the randomized space, which triggered this.
On another box, which has a different BIOS, this bug never happened, in 
tens of thousands of bootup tests.
