I've now ran 2.4.0test3+your ll-patches for a couple of days without any
problems. The test machine is a dual-466celeron dedicated for audio work.  
Benno's latencytest gives excellent results, but I guess this doesn't say
that much on a SMP box.
Also, I've done some audio work with my ecasound software (recording,
mixing, realtime effects processing) and with good results. When running
SCHED_FIFO, I can do pretty much all tasks with very small buffersizes
(32-128 samples, 0,7-3,0ms). I've tried to keep the machine busy with at
least 2-3 running processes all the time. One thing I noted was that when
doing intensive streaming from disk, my 2.2.12 kernel seems to sometimes
perform better (UDMA IDE disks, no patches, standard kernel). This is
probably a disk-i/o issue. All in all, looks good, but this really
should be tested on a uniprocessor machine. Keep up the good work! :)
