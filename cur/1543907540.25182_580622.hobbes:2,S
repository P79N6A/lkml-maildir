I just tried this with GCC 4.2 on x86_64 because I was curious.
struct counter_t { volatile int counter; } test;
struct counter_t *tptr = &test;
int main() {
        int i;
        tptr->counter = 0;
        i = 0;
        while(tptr->counter < 100) {
                i++;
        }
        return 0;
}
$ gcc -O3 -S t.c
a snippet of t.s:
main:
.LFB2:
        movq    tptr(%rip), %rdx
        movl    $0, (%rdx)
        .p2align 4,,7
.L2:
        movl    (%rdx), %eax
        cmpl    $99, %eax
        jle     .L2
Now with the volatile removed:
main:
.LFB2:
        movq    tptr(%rip), %rax
        movl    $0, (%rax)
.L2:
        jmp     .L2
If the compiler can see it clearly, it will optimize out the load
without the volatile.
