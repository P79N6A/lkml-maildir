Why not?  I can set bdi->memory_backed to 1 just like ramfs, implement
my own writeback thread, and voila, no deadlock.
Of course I believe, that it's probably easier to tweak the page cache
to teach it that fuse pages _can_ be written back, but not reliably
like a disk filesystem.  And there's the small problem of limiting the
number of writable pages allocated to FUSE.
