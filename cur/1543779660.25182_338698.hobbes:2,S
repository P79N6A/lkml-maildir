GFS has had proper endian handling for many years, it's still correct as
far as we've been able to test.  I ran bitwise-sparse yesterday and didn't
find anything alarming.

Quite, particular attention has been paid to aligning the structure
fields, you'll find "pad" fields throughout.  We'll write a quick test to
verify that packing doesn't change anything.

The point is you can define GFS2_ENDIAN_BIG to compile gfs to be BE
on-disk instead of LE which is another useful way to verify endian
correctness.
You should be able to use gfs in mixed architecture and mixed endian
clusters.  We don't have a mixed endian cluster to test, though.

We'll try them, they'll probably do fine.

Here's an analysis of three approaches to cluster-fs journaling and their
pros/cons (including using jbd):

I don't know why we'd be interested in signals here.

When unmounting we really appreciate waking up more often than the
timeout, otherwise the unmount sits and waits for the longest daemon's
msleep to complete.  I converted this to msleep recently but it was too
painful and had to go back.
We'll get to your other comments, thanks.
