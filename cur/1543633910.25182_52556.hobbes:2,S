Side note: the other approach to screaming devices is to pray that they
don't happen.
Which is actually the approach Linux takes, and which tends to work
reasonably well. All PCI devices reset without pending interrupts, and
probably windows doesn't react well to the bios doing something stupid.
But it's actually happened for pcmcia depending on init order (and right
now linux pcmcia is just fairly careful about the ordering).
