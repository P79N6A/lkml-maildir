NO !!!
As far as my Toshiba T2110 is concerned, kernels made with your
favoured "make bzImage" will NOT boot! Period!
When somebody manages to fix bzImage so it ALWAYS works, then one can
consider making it the default, but not otherwise...

I would tend to be cautious about "I think" on something like that, as
some configuration changes WILL result in faulty compiles if that
"make clean" is omitted.

No comment...

I've always thought that the stable series should have a LATER number
than the development one for precicely this reason...
