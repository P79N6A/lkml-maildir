I was mostly speaking with the example system in mind (4-node 4-cpu
box), but yes, node-level domain does look for imbalance across max 16
nodes as you mention.
Both node and all-node domains don't have SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE set, which
means idle_balance() will stop looking for imbalance beyonds its own
node. Based on the observed balance within its own node, IMO,
idle_balance() should not cause ->next_balance to be reset.
