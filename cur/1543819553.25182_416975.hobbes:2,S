I don't think it needs to be formally defined, but it happens by default with
e.g. drivers/acpi/utils.c. But, they don't do any translation per se; they 
keep the same semantics that the CA exposes. Over time, these can be converted
to provide a stronger barrier between the CA and the Linuxy stuff, but I
don't think we much formality beyond a few rules of guidance. 
Besides the error namespace and the debug functions, what are other things
off the top of your head that should be contained within the CA and the OSL
layers?
Thanks,
