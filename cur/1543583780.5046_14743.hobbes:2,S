Would this be in any way different from just `hdparm -d0 /dev/hda'?

Sure I can try this, although it's hard to safely say if the problem is
fixed or not, as it's not reliably reproduceable.
BTW, the Inspiron seemed to work just fine with DMA turned on, before the
drive was replaced, with the 2.2.16 kernel that Red Hat ships.  (I always
had DMA turned on, and that was for about six months, without any problems
ever.)
Also, I have some friends using T20s with the same drive without any
problems, with DMA turned on.
Is there any kind of IDE DMA test I could run to see if it works reliably?
