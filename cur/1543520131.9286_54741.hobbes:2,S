Why?  I think it would be much better to have user space check the
watermarks and flush the buffer as it reaches each water mark.  Or at
its option, some other policy.  (Timer signals, optimal icache points
between major rendering units, that sort of thing).
I recall experiments with functional language memory allocators.  They
allocated memory from a large region by simply incrementing the
address.  Something they had to test was when the allocation reached the
end of the region, to trigger a garbage collection.
Two approaches were tried.  One using a pages fault at the end and
trapping the SIGSEGV, the other explicitly comparing the address on each
allocation.  The explicit compare won.
That was just one fault every <insert large block of memory>.  You are
proposing faults much more often.
One obvious complaint about using page faults is the overhead of
updating mappings.  Inter-CPU TLB flushes are particularly expensive.
OTOH, I just realised that if you use carefully crafted assembly
language in the user space writer, you can just wrap around in a buffer
without having to change any page mappings.  The kernel would modify the
user space pointer register.  Ugly, dubious but possible.

I don't see why user space cannot handle this watermarking itself, but
you may be right.
