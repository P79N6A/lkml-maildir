I personally hope one of the patchbot projects (patches-only lists, 
filtered/moderated) gets mature enough to use soon.
Optimizing the bandwidth of Linus and optimizing for the rest of the 
developer community are two seperate problems which may require two seperate 
toolchains.  Posting a patch to the list already isn't enough to get it to 
Linus.  Hasn't been for a while...
