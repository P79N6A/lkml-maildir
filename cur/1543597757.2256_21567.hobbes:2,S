Do you have a cs46xx chip or a cs4232 on that motherboard? I think that we
took care of most of the pops with the cs46xx driver, but I haven't ever
looked at the cs4232 driver (ISA part).

I'm using the cs4232 sound driver, in Linux 2.4.8 (or
2.4.7) for my motherboard's onboard chip.  (The
motherboard is the Intel SE440BX.)  Whenever the sound
device is opened, it makes a loud "pop."  Does this in
all kernels.  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks.
