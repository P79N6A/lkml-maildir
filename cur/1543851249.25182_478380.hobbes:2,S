As I see it, ClearPageError in the try_to_unuse path is the correct
thing to do as once we've marked the swap page as bad, it can't retry to
the same swap page. There is nothing special about the failed pages
beyond that point so we don't need them marked.
Also, if we remove the error flag, the page is still probably on the
inactive list so other existing code is likely to take care of trying a
new write to a another swap entry? I didn't add code for this case for
that reason.

Richard
