Just a fair warning: besides the fact that RawHide RPMs are in no way
guaranteed to work or be at all tested, they are built against glibc
2.1, so they may or may not work on your glibc 2.0 system.  If you have
trouble, try getting the srpm and rebuilding it on your machine.
Just a note FYI that YMMV.  :-)
