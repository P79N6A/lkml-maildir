Hi,
Here it is: ppc kgdb from timesys kernel is available at
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/kgdb-2/linux-2.6.1-kgdb-2.1.0.tar.bz2
This is my attempt at extracting kgdb from TimeSys kernel. It works well in 
TimeSys kernel, so blame me if above patch doesn't work.
ChangeLog:
2004-01-21 TimeSys Corporation
	* kgdb on powerpc.
2004-01-21 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Changes for coding conventions
2004-01-21 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Added a prototype for kgdb8250_add_port.
