hm, a small (and mostly harmless) buglet sneaked into it: the wakeup 
granularity and the runtime limit is now dependent on sched_latency - 
while it should be dependent on min_granularity and latency. To pick up 
that fix please pull from:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
(ontop of your very latest git tree)
the effect of this bug was too high wakeup latency that could cause 
audio skipping on small-audio-buffer setups. (didnt happen on mine, they 
have large enough buffers.)
