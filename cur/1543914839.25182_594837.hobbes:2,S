A summary of what is planned to be submitted in next merge window for kbuild.
The shortlog below have additional details but the headlines are:
o Make the kernel buildable on a cygwin box (but not without a few glitches)
o detect unterminated device id list
o add export_report as a valid top-level make target
o add script to find unused kconfig symbols (try it!)
o allow a user to specify additional flags on the commandline with
  CFLAGS, AFLAGS or CPPFLAGS. The flags will be appended to the kernel defiend flags
The CFLAGS change will conflict with Andi's x86 patches and I fix it
before pushing if Andi's patches are pushed first.
Otherwise no conflicts.
The vmlinux.lds changes that I have sent to a number of arch maintainers
lately are not included.
I expect them to be applied by the respective arch maintainers.
The --gc-section cleanup from Denys Vlasenko will be included in
kbuild after the merge window so we can try it out in -mm before
hitting mainline.
Jan Beulich kconfig patch will most likely be included.
Need to test it first.
Marej menuconfig improvement may also be included.
Last patch looked good but have not made up my mind if it
really help people.
Patched referred below are available at git.kernel.org at kbuild.git
in an hour or so.
