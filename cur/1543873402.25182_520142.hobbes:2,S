My first instinct was to agree with Andi, or maybe have a "shared"
directory a-la x86/.  But I had a fruitful discussion with the PowerPC
people, who went through (and are still completing) the transition to
one directory.
Their verdict, surprisingly, was definitely positive.  They started with
a single powerpc dir which simply included ppc64/ or ppc/, then pulled
parts into that directory until ppc64/ was gone.  The things left in
ppc/ are being slowly merged, and some may be dropped entirely.
They can obviously speak for themselves, but the cleanup caused by the
movement was seen as a net win.
Rusty.
