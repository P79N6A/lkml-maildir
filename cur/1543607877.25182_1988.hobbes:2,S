It is not only ugly over belief but also unportable.
For example the mips port does not have a sys_call_table array at all,
on IA64 funktion pointer do _NOT_ fit into an unsigned long so at least
the prototype is wrong if it works at all.

This is not only racy (no locking!) but also a loophole for binary
modules to do all kinds of crap (see 
http://www.sysinternals.com/linux/
utilities/filemon.shtml for details).  In early 2.5 I will submit a patch
to remove the export, let's see wether it will be accepted.

"Because we did it all the time it's right".
Of course it worked - that doesn't mean it's a good idea.
Arjan might want to comment on how gcc 2.96+ liked the old concept..

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
