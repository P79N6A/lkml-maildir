One more thing, this patch works for the case that memory device "PNP0C80" appears
in container device"ACPI0004,PNP0A05,PNP0A06". In this case, ACPI's notify just comes
to container device (not to memory device in it). This patch is necessary to deal with it.
I heared  that some of firmwares (will?) use this kind of design, memory in a container,
even if it's not NUMA.
