(That's cond_resched())

ah-hah.
It's odd that we'll run initrds in a !SYSTEM_RUNNING state.
It's not an oops - it's sort-of a warning.  Did the system actually
continue to run and boot up OK?
If so, I'd assume that the ext3 filesystem was mounted on a very slow
device - perhaps an IDE disk in PIO mode?
Perhaps we should poke the softlockup detector if someone called
cond_resched() when in a reschedulable state.
