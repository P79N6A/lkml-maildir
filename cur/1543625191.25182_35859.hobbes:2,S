Hmm, at my former job (office in Santa Fe, NM) I found that everything
was considerably more expensive than here in Calgary, Canada.  The worst
was high-speed internet - DSL from Qwest is absurdly expensive (i.e.
U$1000 setup + U$100 or more monthly) and takes a long time to get.
In Calgary there is both high speed cable and ADSL for C$40 a month,
has free setup, and one month free to start.  The lousy Canadian dollar
is finally good for _something_.
Cheers, Andreas
