Aehm, excuse my ignorance, but why is a "regular memory user" effectively _consuming_ the memory? I mean how does CD reading and NFS writing _consume_ memory (to such an extent)? Where _is_ this memory gone? If I stop I/O the memory is still gone. I can make at least quite a bit appear again as free, if I delete all the files I have copied via NFS before. After that I receive lots of free mem right away. Why? I would not expect the memory as validly consumed by knfsd during writing files. I mean what for? I guess from "Inact_dirty" list being _huge_, that the mem is in fact already freed again by the original allocator, but the vm holds it, until ... well I don't know. Or am I wrong?

Uh, I would not do that. To a shared memory pool system this is really contra-productive (is this english?). You simply let the mem vanish in some private pools, so only _one_ process (or whatever) can use it. To tell the full truth, you do not even know, if he really uses it. If he allocated it in a heavy load situation and does not give it back (or has his own weird strategy of returning it) you run out of mem only because of one flaky driver. It will not be easy as external spectator of a driver to find out if it performs well or has some memory leakage inside. You simply can't tell.
In fact I do trust kernel mem management more :-), even if it isn't performing very well currently.

Well, I will try. But must honestly mention, that the whole idea looks like a patch to patch a patch. Especially because nobody can tell what the right reserve may be. I guess this may very much depend on host layout. How do you want to make an acceptable kernel-patch for all the world out of this idea? The idea sounds obvious, but looks not very helpful for solving the basic problem.
