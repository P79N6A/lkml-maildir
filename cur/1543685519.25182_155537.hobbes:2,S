Well, they're not *all* zero.....
I can reproduce this easily with various configurations of ext3 over
raid5, and get a similar problem with ext2 over raid5 (corrupt inodes
rather than directory entries) but ext3 over raid0 is rock-solid.
So I guess the finger points generally in the direction of raid5.
Now I've just got to figure if it is a bug in r5, or some assumption
that it makes that is no longer valid (I was briefly suspicious of
PF_READAHEAD which could have made a real mess of raid5, but that
wouldn't have this symptom)
