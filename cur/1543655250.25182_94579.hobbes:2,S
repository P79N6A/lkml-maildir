I too, think the original parameters are very useful.  I
keep wondering if we could simplify all this by just
restarting the SAME system call.  Keep the restart block to
save stuff in AND let deliver_signal clear a word in it if
it is not restarting the call.  This way the system call
knows it is being restarted, but it has all the parameters
it need PLUS the restart arguments.  The only hole I see
here is making sure the restart block is cleared after use. 
This could be done by bumping it each system call so exactly
1 means this is a restart.  OR, we could trust the users to
always clear it after using (better I think, no code on the
fast path).
Oh, on thinking on this, we can get this behavior with what
we have if we just change the -ERESTARTNOHAND to clear the
first word or the restart block on the handler call.  This
way you can have your cake and eat it too :)
