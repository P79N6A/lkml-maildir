Nothing. Both are good finer-grained alternatives, but only control the 
basic bell tones (ascii 7 sent to stdout, etc...). My patch is a little more 
forceful, since someone could still (regardless of xset and setterm's 
actions) use ioctl() calls to /dev/console to ligitimately make sound. One 
of this patch's aims to be a software equivalent of removing the internal 
speaker from the machine altogether...which results in a slightly smaller 
kernel, to boot.  :)
Also, at bootup, if I have a pcmcia card in my machine, the card detecting 
code likes to beep a few times. Which is fine if you like that sort of 
thing, but this patch prevents squeaking at bootup time before your init 
scripts can issue a setterm command.
That's my thinking on the matter. Again, I hope these patches can be of use 
to someone.
