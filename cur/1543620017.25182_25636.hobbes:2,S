Greetings,
I have  2.4.7-10smp (RedHat 7.2 install) running on a dell on a dell 2550, 
the systems runs a mysql/apache applicaton (blackboard). Several times a 
day, as the load increases I get the following error:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Tx hung
The system pauses for 3-5 seconds during this error and then continues 
happily.
dmesg info:
Jan 20 17:14:40 dewey kernel: eth0: Broadcom BCM5700 found at mem feb00000,

Jan 21 09:04:36 dewey kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Jan 21 09:04:36 dewey kernel: eth0: Tx hung
Is this a hardware error? Should I upgrade to the 2.4.9.13 kernel? Any 
advice appreciated!
