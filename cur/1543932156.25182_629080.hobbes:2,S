Attached is a patch that changes the outs to ins on port 0x80.
I did NOT let gcc decide what to do about modified registers.
Instead, the code saves/restores EAX itself so that all of the
times (whatever they are) are the same.
The code works and is running here. I also patched a very early
version (2.4.26) running on  a 400 MHz i486 with an real ISA
bus (Adaptec AHA1453). It works too.
David, will you please try it on your machine. Maybe reading
from the port is less harmful than writing.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
