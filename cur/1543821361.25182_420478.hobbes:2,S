Dear ,
    I have written a framebuffer driver for my OMAP850 platform LCD
controller.linux logo and kernel debug message can show now.But screen
is "shaking".Just like,for every pixel,black and white,black and
white........at high frequency.Is there any kernel thread refresh
console?? Or I have some error in my driver?
   Thank you
