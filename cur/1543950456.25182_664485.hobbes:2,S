The original Deathstar ailment had nothing to do with firmware or cooling.
But rather, a bad batch of chips that IBM had the misfortune to use a lot of.
The chips would grow tiny internal whiskers over a period of 2+ years,
and eventually short circuit themselves.
My last one died here just a few weeks ago, after sitting on the shelf
for nearly all of it's life.  Never more than perhaps 40 power-on hours total,
and never enough to get very warm.
Cheers
