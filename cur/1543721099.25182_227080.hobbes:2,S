Hmmm, I guess my posting was a bit ambigious in this regard. I started  
out with 2.4.18, upgraded to 2.4.19, later 2.4.21. As the fcdsl-crashes  
(triggered by disconnection) didn't cease, I googled and found other  
reports of the same bug on kernels 2.4.18 and higher, so I decided to  
give it a try and downgrade to 2.4.17. From there, I went right up to  
2.4.24. At that time I learned of a patch to the module which allowed  
to run it without the problems previously encountered. However, there  
still remained the system freezes from the second bug (buffer.c/ 
transaction.c), so I decided to upgrade to 2.4.25 and, ultimately,  
2.4.26.
Best regards,
Andreas
