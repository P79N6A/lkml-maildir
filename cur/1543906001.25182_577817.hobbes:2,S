Umm. The WARN_ON() might actually get a "long long" value for all we know. 
Ie it's perfectly possible that the WARN_ON might look like
	/* Must not have high bits on */
	WARN_ON(offset & 0xffffffff00000000);
which on a 32-bit pcc would apparently do the wrong thing entirely as it 
stands now. No?
I think I'll commit the !!(x) version, and you guys can try to figure out 
what the right thing is long-term. For all I know, the proper solution is 
to just revert the whole mess, and *not* make WARN_ON() return a value at 
all, since that seems to be the fundamental mistake here.
