True.

Sadly things like this will continue as long as there is a single OS that has 
more than a 70% market share of the common desktop market.

Yes, but if the hardware *ISN'T* broken, then claiming it is and closing out a 
bug is the wrong thing to do. The right thing to do would be to find out why 
the hardware isn't working correctly for the OS/driver combination in 
question and, if possible, fix the driver.

Look to the bug-report posted (cleaned of evidence that would incriminate any 
single person) by (IIRC) Adrian. The guy says "It worked with X and works in 
Windows, but it now fails with message Z."
Maintainer says "Your hardware is broken", closes the bug and then goes on to 
say "If the hardware isn't broken, talk to the people in charge of A and B 
because my code isn't buggy."
That is idiotic and immature.
