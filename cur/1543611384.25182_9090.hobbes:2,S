i recently got some of these messages about "attempt to access beyond
end of device" when running badblocks on a partition, on 2.4.15-pre1.
i got two of them, and in the end badblocks said it found 2 bad blocks.
partitions were made with fdisk.
i don't know if it's normal or not, but bothers a little still. mke2fs
went through without errors and haven't noticed any corruption so far.
