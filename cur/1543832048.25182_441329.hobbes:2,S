Am I staring at this crooked, or not looking deep enough? My manual page for 
prctl says 2 is valid there. Specifically:
              Since  kernel 2.6.13, the value 2 is also permitted; this causes
              any binary which normally would not be dumped to be dumped read-
              able   by   root   only.    (See   also   the   description   of
              /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable in proc(5).)
...has something changed, and my manpages don't reflect it? Did I miss a 
conversation about this?
Thanks,
Chase
