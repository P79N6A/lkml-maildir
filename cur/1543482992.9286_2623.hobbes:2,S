This has been asserted by a few. It has not yet been demonstrated
(either experimentally or theoretically) to be true. I've seen various
hypotheses float by, but all have proved bogus when considered. In the
end, all the security concerns are based on faith that exposing
physical pages must be "bad".
The same goes for denial of service attacks.

It's a powerful debugging tool. Even on a kernel with page colouring,
that doesn't mean you *get* page colouring. An application that is not
behaving as expected can start probing the foundations upon which it
resides.

See above. So far every proposed "example" of security/DoS attacks
have been bogus.

Nope. Think about it. These attacks are possible anyway.
