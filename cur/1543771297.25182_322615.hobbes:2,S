There is a workaround.  Get an UPS just for the disks.  It don't have to be
big, just enough to keep the disks going long enough to commit their
caches after the rest of the machine died from a power loss.  Such a small
unit could possibly fit inside the cabinet, avoiding the trouble with
people stepping on the power cord.
With this in place, any write that makes it from the controller to the
disk is safely stored for all practical purposes.
