sched-devel.git has new mechanisms against runaway RT tasks. There's a 
new RLIMIT_RTTIME rlimit - if an RT task exceeds that rlimit then it is 
sent SIGXCPU.
there's also a new group scheduling extension that is driven via a 
sysctl:
  /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_ratio
this way if a user has a runaway RT task, other users (and root) will 
still have some CPU time left. (in Peter's latest patchset that is 
replaced via rt_runtime_ns - but this is a detail)
so instead of the never-ending arms race of kernel thread priorities 
against RT task priorities, we are going towards making RT tasks safer 
on a policy level.
