I doubt it's related to pump: a few times I've seen the 3c59x driver drop
the first few transmit packets.  Try loading the driver as a module and
putting the whole modprobe ; ifconfig ; ping <somehost> set of commands
into a script and watch what happens.  This goes for all ethernet driver
writers.
