hfs cds are fine for me at work, on 2.4.0-test1-ac18. (!)
miscellaneous info:
$ mount -V
mount: mount-2.10f
cdrom drives:
(home)
sg0 scsi0 ch0 ID0 Lun0 ansi2 CD-ROM(5) PIONEER CD-ROM DR-U03S 1.01
sg10 scsi0 ch0 ID6 Lun0 ansi2 CD-ROM(5) MATSHITA CD-R   CW-7502 4.17
(work)
hdd: CD-ROM 50X L, ATAPI CDROM drive
i'm fairly sure i've used them on 2.4.0-test4 (home).
will verify tomorrow if i can remember to bring the cds home.
in fact, i can't remember ever using a kernel where they *didn't* work.
am i just weird? :)  i guess if they are broke, it was a fairly recent
breakage.
