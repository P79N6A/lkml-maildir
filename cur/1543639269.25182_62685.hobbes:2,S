Hello,
here's a patch against 2.4.19 / 2.4.20-pre1 that brings support for 
UltraDMA on newest SiS chipsets. This brings the main tree SiS IDE 
support to AC tree level.
As always, any failure/success report is welcomed.
Note: I'm already aware of a minor bug with 630ET and 630ST chipsets 
that clamps udma modes to UDMA4 instead of UDMA5.
