Ok, will try the latest kernel to see if that fixes it. 2.6.20.1 was
actually the latest kernel when I rolled it out to these machines. The
IRQ Lockup messages have never caused any problems to the the
application, but only recently I caught the stack trace. Of course I
may have missed catching these stack traces in the past, but they are
rare.
Thanks again for your input.
