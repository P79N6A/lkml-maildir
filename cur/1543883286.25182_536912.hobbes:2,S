This is a fully funded regular full-time position @google's Mountain View
HQ, sitting within nagging range of myself, doing precisely what you
describe.
Unfortunately the recruiting has been a bit tricky - this is not a typical
job and it's a funny mixture of bureaucracy/politics/social engineering
and programming.  People who are skilled in both areas, are, ah, uncommon.
But it will happen eventually.
Meanwhile I
- ensure that all bugzilla reports are routed to the relevant maintainer
- ensure that all those who reported bugs via email are later asked to
  raise bugzilla reports if it didn't get fixed (but I only monitor one list!)
- continue to file away all the real-looking bugzillas with the intention
  of generating aggregated reports, but you know how it is.
