I was just doing the math for 1k ext2 filesystems, and the numbers aren't
nearly as nice.  We get:
	(1024 / 16) * 127 * .75 = 6096		# 1 level
	(1024 / 16) * 128 * 127 * .75 = 780288	# 2 levels
Basically (IMHO) we will not really get any noticable benefit with 1 level
index blocks for a 1k filesystem - my estimates at least are that the break
even point is about 5k files.  We _should_ be OK with 780k files in a single
directory for a while.  Looks like we will need 2-level indexes sooner than
you would think though.  Note that tests on my workstation showed an average
filename length of 10 characters (excluding MP3s at 78 characters), so this
would give 20-byte (or 88-byte) dirents for ext3, reducing the files count
to 4857 and 621792 (or 78183 and 40029696 for 4k filesystems) at 75% full.
Cheers, Andreas
