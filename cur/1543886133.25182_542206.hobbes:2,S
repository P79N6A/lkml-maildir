Hi Jeff,
	Thanks for your review.  Questions below.

	I realize your continual battle with this, but adding a layer of
indirection doesn't seem like it will add clarity.  The issues with
__pa() are reasonably known (don't hand it a vmalloc address, for
example).  Any wrapper I create would be another hurdle to jump 8(

I'm not so convinced: scheduling tends to give us pretty good interrupt
mitigation.  However, if you wish to send a patch, I'd be happy to
benchmark the two 8)

Because it's not implemented: our MAC is advertised in the device page
and we'd have to change it there too.
Trivial to do, but is there a compelling reason to implement it?

You meant to type "useful and accurate", I think?  They show up in
ifconfig, so you can see what the underlying devices are using.  They're
as useful for virtual hardware as they are for physical hardware.

That seems... odd.  My driver can do SG, and may or may not need csums.
The current Linux code turns SG off if I need csums and that's fine, but
it hardly seems like my device should be making that decision.

OK, thanks.

Erk, good catch!

What is it about me and iomap... will fix that too.

Yes.  It is never built as a module currently (though it should work).
Thanks!
Rusty.
