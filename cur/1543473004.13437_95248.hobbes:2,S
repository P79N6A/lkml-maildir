Hello,
        first of all, this isn't supposed to have anything to do with the
kernel. When you get an unresolved symbol, it is because the application
is linked to a dynamic library and ld cannot find it anymore. This could 
mean sevral things:
1- You unistalled a library.
2- The ld cannot find one of the libraries netscape is linked to.
Solution:
try ldd `which netscape` and then try to locate all of them (make shure that
your database is updated...). Then, look in your /etc/ld.so.conf and your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to see if it is there. If it is just in your LD_LIBRARY
_PATH, try adding the directory in /etc/ld.so.conf and running ldconfig after 
that. I heared that the 2.1.* kernels get in the way of ld some times (just
a rumor), but if this works, who cares why.
        I hope this is of some help
                Papi
