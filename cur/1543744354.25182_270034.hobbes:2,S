Can flash be treated as a swap device at the moment? If so, it might
simply be a matter of specifying the same parameter used in swapon for
the resume2= boot parameter.
If more work is required, I'd happily help, although I might be a little
slow: I'm only work on this on a voluntary basis at the moment (looking
for full time work, from next month though).
