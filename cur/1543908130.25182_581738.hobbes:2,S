Just checked. i386 and x86-64 seems to be sane - udelay() and ndelay()
are not inlined.
Several arches are still frantically try to make udelay faster. Many have
the same comment:
/*
 * Use only for very small delays ( < 1 msec).  Should probably use a
 * lookup table, really, as the multiplications take much too long with
 * short delays.  This is a "reasonable" implementation, though (and the
 * first constant multiplications gets optimized away if the delay is
 * a constant)
 */
and thus seem to be a cut-n-paste code.
BTW, almost all arched have __const_udelay(N) which obviously
does not delay for N usecs:
#define udelay(n) (__builtin_constant_p(n) ? \
        ((n) > 20000 ? __bad_udelay() : __const_udelay((n) * 0x10c7ul)) : \
        __udelay(n))
Bad name.
Are patches which de-inline udelay and do s/__const_udelay/__const_delay/g
be accepted?
Arches with udelay's still inlined are below. mips is especially big.
frv has totally bogus ndelay().
