Thanks, I'll look through that when preparing my next patch set.
Will take some time through as I've just pushed updates and also
will be offline for a week soon.

Yes, it could.

I don't care, the lirc people should, I already have to many projects
for my time.
Last time I checked the code was in a pretty bad state, it needs a
major overhaul IMHO before it can be included.  Lots of historical
cruft (dates back to 2.2 days), parts are not SMP save, ...
At least for the TV cards I prefeare to use the linux input layer
instead, see the ir-kbd-* drivers.  They didn't catch up yet with
lirc on supported hardware through, so I don't want break lirc now.
But the stuff in bttv-if.c is obsolete and I plan to drop that
altogether some day, see the comment about that in bttv.h.  Given that
there will be no 2.7 in near future due to the new devel model I maybe
should make that a time bomb instead ...
