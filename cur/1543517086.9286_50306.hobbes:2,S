You compiled with kernel symbols (genksyms) active but testfoo was not
resolved correctly.  At a guess you did not run make dep after adding
testfoo, the make dep step builds the genksym data for the later
compile to use.  Compiling alone does not work for external symbols
when genksyms is used, you have to run make dep as well.
