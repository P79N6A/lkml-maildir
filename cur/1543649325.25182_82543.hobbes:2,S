Ok.  I'd be inclined to leave the high-usage things where they are, 
although it would be nice to be able to make the NMI watchdog a module. 
 oprofile should probably stay where it is.  Do you have an alternate 
implementation that would be more efficient?

Registered NMI users in procfs.

Yes.  But I don't understand why they would be used in the notifier code.

I'm not worried about kernel versions so much as processor capability. 
 Some processors may not have NMIs, or may not be capable of doing this. 
 A few of these exist (like __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG).  The name's probably 
bad, maybe it should be "__HAVE_ARCH_NMI_HANDLER"?

I looked, and the rcu code relys on turning off interrupts to avoid 
preemption.  So it won't work.
Thanks again,
