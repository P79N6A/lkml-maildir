Reprise; This is a system with a TNT2 video card,scsi and 2 cpus.
It locks up with acpi on, when switching vc's.(as described on lkml)
I have now established that no problem occurs when compiled as UP system.
This is true if acpi is modules or compiled in.
Trying a different compiler isn't feasible for me.
Any other ideas?
Regards
John
