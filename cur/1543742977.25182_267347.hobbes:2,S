Why testing for signals? Do you expect any?

That's the main problem here, isn't it. Serial communications are slow.
Tying up a shared thread just because of this just does not look right.
And in such CPU intensive way, too.
Looking at pl2303 in 2.4, I do not see any difference between its ->write
method and generic_write which would be specific to pl2303. The key
difference is that generic_write participates in the protocol governed by
port->write_busy. So why don't you simply drop pl2303_write?
