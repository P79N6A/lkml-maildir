 Hmm, I can repeatedly test by linking against candidate libraries by
converting the current if...else test to nested if..else (adding
-lcurses while I'm at it), but I can't crack setting HOST_LOADLIBES from
that - if the link succeeded, I'm into the shell code to tidy up and
from there I can't set a variable in the Makefile .
 I don't want to attempt to build a configure script in a Makefile -
even if it's possible, I think it would be nasty.  So unless I've
misunderstood your question, no, I can't specify both libraries.
 Note that I originally asked why on a system that doesn't use utf8, I
should rebuild ncurses.  A sufficiently compelling reason would make me
rebuild.
