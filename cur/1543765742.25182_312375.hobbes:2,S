*Why* do they need this is what I asked.  A sensible real world
example would be useful.

I used to work in telco space, we had some such systems and similar
things.  Some from Nortel even.
None of the things I saw did anything that I can image really need a
complicated kernel patch for.
In fact, I'm not convinced *any* of these uses really needed
live-patching at all.
I would just like some examples of real-world needs and an explanation
of why it's needed.  Not handy-waving.
