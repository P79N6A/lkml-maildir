I am not sure what you intend this application for. If it is mission
critical in any way shape or form, I would still recommend using something
like Veritas (which unfortunately is not ported to Linux yet). I have
heard good things about XFS although I have not had the chance to use it
yet.

Have fun and do post your findings back to l-k. I would be interested in
hearing what you end up with.
