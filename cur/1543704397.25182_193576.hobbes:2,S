I have had exactly the same problem with 2.6.{0,1} kernels:
"NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out"
where eth0 is:
"03:07.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82546EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) (rev 01)".
The only difference is that my eth0 is at 100 Mbps Full Duplex.
And yes, in my case this problem was solved by `ethtool -K eth0 tso off`.
