Hi Linus, is possible plan something to make faster and easier the way
to loking for a specific bug?
E.g:
<
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/linux/+bug/110784>
In this bug, I think that it appear after ~2.6.22, so is necessary do a
git-bisect more than 13 times!
I need more than 20min to compile each kernel, so is necessary ~260min.
My wife will kill me if I says: Hey baby, wait 260min to me compile a
lot of kernel here.
Best regards,
Renato
