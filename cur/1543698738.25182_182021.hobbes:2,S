So what? By the same argument they are derived work of Linux too.
This is exactly the flaw of "once you include my code, you are derived
work of mine".

This is not a matter of copyright. This is a matter of "being derived or
not".

I disagree. 
It all depends on how significant the inlined code is compared to the
whole work of the module. For inline functions, I don't see why using
them would be a significant part - by definition "inline" means
"small/trivial", otherwise you would not have inlined them.
Otherwise, since SCO found a few lines of code copied from Unix in Linux
source, are we saying the whole million lines of code is derived from
Unix?
