  Well, the standard way is:
1 - the code program header, to be write protected if possible
2 - the (initialised) data program header, to be able to restart the program by just reload/re-entry,
    and after that (memsiz - filesz) of BSS
 Anything after is non standard. The number of program header is written in the ELF header,
but anything over 2 probably need a special loader for the extra treatment.
 That isn't usual to have something near zero, because it is better not to map
any memory there to catch null pointer dereference (in virtual memory system).
 I assume you care about this ELF header because you are also a user of
the ELF file vmlinux, aren't you?

 And you do not want to write protect the kernel code (if the CPU write protection
is not working, the hardware is not working so debug will be difficult, and a simple
CRC32 can tell kernel memory failure) and use twice the same code memory
(with different data area or saving kernel data elsewhere before reload).
 Is that related to module loading or instruction set detection/patch or multiprocessor?

  So here you are not really using the initial ELF program header of vmlinux,
but more the section header and my PT_LOAD section bother you, I better
understand. You cannot really claim you are only doing standard/usual
ELF treatment.
 Thanks,
 Etienne.
