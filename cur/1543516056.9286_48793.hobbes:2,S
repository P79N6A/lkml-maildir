I've tested this. Unfortunately, it adds 6 bytes of code to
the boot sector code. With my binutils (2.9.1.0.24, which is
Ok according to Documentation/Changes), the boot sector code
becomes 498 bytes, which is exactly one byte too many (due
to the `.org 497' near the end of bootsect.S).
There are several workarounds. One is to remove the redundant
`pushw %dx'/`popw %dx' instructions from kill_motor. Another is
to use my patch which shifts the burden to the Makefile.
