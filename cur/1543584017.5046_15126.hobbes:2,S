Just a note -- the change in ac4 and beyond to the new aic7xxx scsi driver and
move Doug Ledford's now non-supported driver to aic7xxx-old breaks the pcmcia
3.1.24 release if you configure scsi device support into the kernel.  The
aic7xxx driver is used to support the Adpatec 1480 scsi card.  I have a 1460
scsi card, so I build my laptop release with scsi support included.
I'll post this also to the pcmcia support pages.
