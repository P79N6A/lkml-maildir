Regardless of whatever verifications your application is doing
on the data, it is not checksumming the ports and that's what
the pseudo-header is helping with.
You cannot disable checksums in ipv6/UDP, they are not optional and
with %99.9999999 of cards doing the checksum in hardware, and even if
we do have to compute it it's free during the copy during recvmsg().
