Hmm.. 
I don't think it is used in spinlocks ever. At least it SHOUDLN'T be used. 
The spinlock code uses "local_irq_save()" and "local_irq_restore()", both
of which should be fine in all the contexts you're talking about (they'll
never end up re-enabling interrupts).
The "unlock_irq()" version is basically almost never used, so yes, while
it woul dget slightly longer it shouldn't much matter.
