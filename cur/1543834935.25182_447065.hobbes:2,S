Is there some reason this code:
                for (i = 0; i < loops_per_jiffy * HZ; i++) {
                        if (__raw_spin_trylock(&lock->raw_lock))
                                return;
                        __delay(1);
                }
needs to continuously try to update the spinlock?  Shouldn't it just
read it first, like this, to avoid the bus update traffic?
                        if (spin_can_lock(&lock->raw_lock) &&
                            __raw_spin_trylock(&lock->raw_lock))
                                return;
Also, looking at __delay(), I foresee problems on i386 with the HPET timer.
Every call to __delay() causes at least two HPET timer reads and it looks
like they're slow (using readl() on ioremapped memory, anyway.)
