No, the problem with preempt_disable/enable is that they go away if 
preemption is not enabled. So you really do have to do it by hand with the 
"inc_preempt_count".

True. I guess we should have a "preempt_check_resched()" there too. That's 
what "kunmap_atomic()" does too (which is what we rely on in the other 
case we do this..)
