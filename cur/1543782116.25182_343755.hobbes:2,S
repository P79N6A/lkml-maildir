In fact, we need that for the G5 thermal driver too. I wonder why/how
this export got removed ... Some over-zealous janitors ?
Hrm... /me plays with gitk
Ahhh, ok, so that is this patch:
<<
machine_restart, machine_halt and machine_power_off are machine
    specific hooks deep into the reboot logic, that modules
    have no business messing with.  Usually code should be calling
    kernel_restart, kernel_halt, kernel_power_off, or
    emergency_restart. So don't export machine_restart,
    machine_halt, and machine_power_off so we can catch buggy users.

Well, I think for now, it's safe for therm_pm72 to call
machine_power_off() in case of critical overtemp. I'll have a look at
kernel_* equivalents later.
Can you still slip that patch into 2.6.13 ?
Ben.
