Oh, I missed one case: When calling cdrecord with no cd in the plextor
for the first time after booting, i.e., when /etc/hotplug/block.agent
(on SuSE 9.1) jumps in, I see a 0x1 additionally:
Aug 18 10:27:00 zassenhaus /etc/hotplug/block.agent[8396]: new block device /block/hdc
Aug 18 10:27:00 zassenhaus /etc/hotplug/block.agent[8397]: new block device /block/hdd
Aug 18 10:27:56 zassenhaus kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x1e not allowed with read-mode
Aug 18 10:28:01 zassenhaus kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x1 not allowed with read-mode
Aug 18 10:28:02 zassenhaus kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x1e not allowed with read-mode
Aug 18 10:28:02 zassenhaus kernel: SCSI-CMD Filter: 0xe9 not allowed with read-mode
...
The 0x1 does not appear afterwors anymore...
Does it, by the way, make any sense that I report this here? Or will the
security model have to be desgined first like you discussed it, before
such tests are helpful? Just to avoid that I flood you with a list of
blocked commands when you can't make any use of it now :-)
cu,
Frank
