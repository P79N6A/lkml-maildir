Yes, very much.  IDE is broken in this regard - you can only do I/O
to one device on the IDE channel at the same time.  Either you need
to get additional IDE controllers (about $35 or so) or you split your
devices so that they are on separate IDE channels (i.e. DVD and ZIP
together, HD on the other channel if copying HD <-> DVD and HD <-> ZIP).
Of course with 2 HDs, you should probably keep them on separate channels
also.
Cheers, Andreas
