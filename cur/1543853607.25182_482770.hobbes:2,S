I don't think anyone likes the HAL-based architecture.  I don't think
we will accept a HAL-based driver into the upstream kernel.
The point is that the ar5k is now safe to be used as a reference and
source of information (and code, as appropriate) without copyright FUD.
Distilling that information into a proper Linux driver is work that
remains to be done.
