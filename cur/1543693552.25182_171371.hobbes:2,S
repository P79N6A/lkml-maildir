Hi,
	Some thoughts for 2.7.Someone has other ideas, comments ?
*	slab allocation limit
*	complete user quota centralization 
*	Add _responsibilities_ for virtual process tree and possible
relation in oops cases 
*	Does the whole proc vm stuff root/box relevant ?I don't think
so....Hence, those proc entries deserve security relevant attributes 
*	Devices should be limited as well against bad usage(floppy defect),
viral activity(netcard rush)... 
*	All this guides me to a more global conclusion in which all that
stuff should be kobject registration relevant 
*	Meanwhile, we don't have a kobject <-> security bridge :( 
Regards,
Fabian
