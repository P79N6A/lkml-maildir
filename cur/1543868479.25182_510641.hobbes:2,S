Alan,
The SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE ioctl is also defined in
the block layer, see block/scsi_ioctl.c .
I suspect it is just a kludge to fool cdrecord that it
is talking to a sg device. [One of many kludges in the
block SG_IO ioctl implementation to that end.]
So perhaps the block layer versions of SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE
and SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE need to be similarly capped.
Actually I think that I would default SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE to
request_queue->max_sectors * 512 in the block layer
implementation (as there is no "reserve buffer" associated
with a block device).
<aside>
The idea of a reserved buffer may live on in bsg as experience
with sg has shown that it is the fastest way to do (mmap-ed) IO.
Having one reserved buffer per file descriptor means not
having to create and tear down a scatter gather list
per IO. [Having a pool of such lists would be even better.]
Until optical storage needs 10 times its current datarates
then cdrecord will not need this mechanism.
