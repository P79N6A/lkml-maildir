strip also has other problems - it violates the layering of the kernel
subsystems and drivers in the get_baud() function:
        if ((tty->termios->c_cflag & CBAUD) == B38400 && tty->driver_data) {
                struct async_struct *info =
                    (struct async_struct *) tty->driver_data;	/* XXX */
                if ((info->flags & ASYNC_SPD_MASK) == ASYNC_SPD_HI)
                        return (B57600);
                if ((info->flags & ASYNC_SPD_MASK) == ASYNC_SPD_VHI)
                        return (B115200);
There is no guarantee what tty->driver_data points at, and in fact
today the above code will be broken.
The best thing to happen here is to ignore the B38400 "hack" for fast
baud rates, and use the helper functions in the tty layer to get the
_numeric_ baud rate, which seems to be what the driver wants anyway:
        /* If the user has selected a baud rate above 38.4 see what magic we have to do */
        if (strip_info->user_baud > B38400) {
So, I don't think that this patch will be sufficient to resurect strip,
but I also don't think that it's an impossible task.  I'm just wondering
if it's really worth the effort given that we now have the vastly more
popular 802.11.
