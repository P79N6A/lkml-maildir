Mr. Brian Bacon Evans  (Agent)
Representing Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky 
Yukos Oil Company in Russia. 
Dear Friend,
I am Mr. Brian Bacon Evans and I represent Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky the 
former C.E.O of Yukos Oil Company and Mentap bank (Russia).
I have a very sensitive and confidential brief from him to ask for your 
partnership in liquidating funds in Gibraltar.
I will give the details, but in summary, the funds are coming via private 
security investment in Gibraltar. This is a legitimate transaction. You will 
be paid 30% of the portfolio investment value as your "management fees". If 
you are interested, please write back to me via my private E-
mail.bryanans1965@satellite-email.com.
Kindly, provide me with your confidential telephone number, fax number and 
email address and I will provide further details and if you are satisfied I 
can proceed with the instructions.
Please we cannot afford any political problems because of recent events in 
Russia. So I will advice you keep this to your self.
Finally, please note that this must be concluded within reasonable time 
frame therefore your prompt reply is essential.
Write me back. I look forward to it.
Wishing   you a prosperous New Year,
Best Regards
Mr. Brian Bacon Evans
