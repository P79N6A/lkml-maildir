Yup ... LOL.  One sick piece of code.
I didn't return the actual return from sched_getaffinity() because (1)
it's ok to estimate the mask size too high, and (2) given that the man
page and kernel don't agree on the return value of sched_getaffinity(),
I figured that the less I relied on it, the longer my user code would
continue functioning in a useful manner.  As always, the key to robust
code (code that withstands the perils of time) is minimizing risky
assumptions.
