WTF are you smoking?
You said yourself that your feature has currently exactly 121 users.
And why should anyone have to contact you before disabling your feature?
Everyone enables the subset of features he considers useful, and there's
no reason to contact anyone when disabling a feature in the kernel
(or would you consider it a morally bad thing that I disabled kernel 
preemption in my kernel without asking anyone for permission?).
And it was you who said just a few days ago [1]:

If I've to keep reading these threads about CONFIG_SECCOMP every few
months then set it to N (even if I disagree with that setting). Like
Alan said, what really matters is what distro will choose in their
config, not the default (and I doubt fedora ships with cifs=Y like the
default where only the required stuff is set to Y, please focus on the
big stuff first ;).
