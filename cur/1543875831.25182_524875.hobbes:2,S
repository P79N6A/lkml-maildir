yeah, I did a couple hours testing with rc5, rc5+quicklists,
rc5+quicklists+qlhack, where "qlhack" is my patch which removes the
quicklists and mysteriously causes i386 to crash.
I was testing 8-way x86_64 with patch-scripts (wildly fork-intensive),
kernel build and lmbench.
Basically I was unable to observe any statistically meaningful-looking
differences between any of them.
I would like to test qlhack on ia64, because ia64 puts pte-pages into the
quicklists as well, but my ia64 machine is presently indisposed.
My (much) preferred way to handle all this is to remove the quicklists from
all architectures: just use alloc_page() and free_page() for pte pages, pmd
pages, etc.  I remain unaware of any testing whcih indicates that this
would be a bad change.
