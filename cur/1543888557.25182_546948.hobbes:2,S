The real solution is to have the user space tool to create these
device nodes in advance.
The original loop patch was coded such that when we open a loop device
N, the immediate adjacent device "N + 1" is created.  This will keep
"mount -o loop" happy because it typically does a linear scan to find
a free device.  This might be somewhat hackary, but certainly will be
backward compatible before user space solution is deployed.
However, the code was removed by Al in this commit:
