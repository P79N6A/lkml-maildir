At LAC we discovered that with 2.6.16-rt*, CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE,
CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS=y, and CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS=y with x86_64 is
a valid combination, but the machine immediately shuts down on boot
(before Uncompressing Linux even appears).
Are these likely to be related, or is the problem likely to be somewhere
else?
