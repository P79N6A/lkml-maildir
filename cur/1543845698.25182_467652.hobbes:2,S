Sorry, Replying to myself.  I forgot to mention in my last note why specifically
I was calling for this change, and why it was necessecary.  In addition to being
the standard in the script for executable sections, kexec also appears to rely
on PT_LOAD sections being on page boundaries.  With vmlinux.ld.s as it is, that
isn't the case, and so we can't load any kernels with kexec at the moment.  I've
seen this on the most recent fedora kernels (which have the latest version of
this linker script), and this patch corrects that.
Please look at the file in its entirety, and if you still feel that modifying
the script so all the ALIGN(4096) directives to be ALIGN(PAGE_SIZE) instead is
the direction to go, I'll implement the change and test it out.
Regards
Neil
