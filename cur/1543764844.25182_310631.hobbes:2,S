OK, you _may_ be out of memory here (depending on what the lower zone
protection for DMA ends up as), however you are well above all the
"emergency watermarks" in ZONE_NORMAL. Also:

This one shows plenty of memory. The allocation failure messages are
actually a good thing, and show that my patch is sort of working. I
have reworked it a bit so they won't show up though.
So probably not your common or garden memory deadlock.
The common theme seems to be: try_to_free_pages, swap_writepage,
mempool_alloc, down/down_failed in .text.lock.md. Next I would suspect
md/raid1 - maybe some deadlock in an uncommon memory allocation
failure path?
I'll see if I can reproduce it here.
