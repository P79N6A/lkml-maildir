I use a very similar setup; I now have a static IP, but I used the same
technique when I had a dynamic IP;
    demand
    192.168.88.1:192.168.99.1
    ipcp-accept-local
    ipcp-accept-remote
This sets up a dummy address on the ppp0 interface when it first boots,
but allows the address to change when the connection is established.
I think the kernel is choking on your 0.0.0.0 choice for a dummy
address.  Choose another.
This setting also seems to help:
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr
