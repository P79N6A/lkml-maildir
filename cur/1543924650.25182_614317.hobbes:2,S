Well, we *could* do a 16-bit PM segment (and do two far jumps), but that 
seems rather silly.  We'd have to patch the GDT for the base in that 
case, anyway.
This is more or less the same code I had for the first version of the 
patch, modulo moving the short jump of course.  I do like making the 
32-bit code a separate function, but it really should be "movl %ecx,..." 
in the 32-bit code.
I have to admit I agree with Eric that this is probably overkill, but 
hey, there is nothing like a bit of overkill to make sure something is 
really and truly dead.
Cooking up a tree now.
