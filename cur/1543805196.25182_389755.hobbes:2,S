Yeah the new tty code assumed the same locking rules as the old tty code
and nobody on the planet followed them since 2.2.

I think you've been reading my mind, only you've actually come up with a
slightly neater variant than I have half coded here.

This seems unrelated and also not useful. 0 space is such a special case
that it isn't worth the check - and it works fine anyway with 0.

Should die as a duplicate by the look of it, and the tty one probably
should cease to be inline.
Looks good to me.
