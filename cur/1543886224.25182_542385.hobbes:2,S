Um, I've picked up the tinycc baton (in my copious free time) and am slowly 
trying to get it to build a bootable linux kernel.  There's a ways to go, and 
I really have no idea what I'm doing, but I have help and even made a release 
recently (which is already significantly out of date, largely thanks to David 
Wheeler):

Admittedly, a lot of this involves implementing gcc extensions, but gratuitous 
use of them when there's a perfectly good c99 way of doing it isn't 
necessarily a plus.  Fabrice got it as far as tccboot before QEMU ate his 
life, we've improved a bit since then, and there's presumably a finite amount 
of work left to be done...
