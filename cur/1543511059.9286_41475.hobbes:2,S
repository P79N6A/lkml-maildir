I've reported this on this list, I guess your kernel parameters are 
something like this:
append="console=ttyS1 console=tty0" 
change it to just:
append="console=ttyS1"
and all messages will go to the serial console, but you won't get the
console messages in tty0, as usual (this is the bug).

And if this helps, my machine is a dual PII, SMP enabled, hummm,
lemme try with smp disabled...
