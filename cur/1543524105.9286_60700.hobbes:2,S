FWIW, I chose the gcc syntax since it was already very prevelant
in the kernel... my patch simply finishes conversion for file_ops :)
1) I'd hate adding a #define to each file or create another .h dep
2) it's a simple perl script to make this change later on if it
   proves to be desirable.
As it stands, gcc 2.7.2.3 is still our baseline compiler so I'd rather
keep things compatible with that my design, not by #ifdef.  While I
personally like the C99 syntax better, I think it's important to at
least get named initilizers in place first, and we can either change
or abstract out the interface later on.  First thing's first :)
