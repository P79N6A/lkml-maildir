That's *precisely* the case in question.  The whole design of the page
cache involves reading entire pages at a time, in fact.  We _could_
read in only partial pages, but in that case we end up wasting a lot
of the page.

Agreed.  The only case where blockdev-in-pagecache really results in
significantly more IO is partial writes followed by partial reads.
Reads from totally-uncached pages ought to just fill the entire page
from disk; it's only when there is something already present
in the cache for that page that we want to look for partial buffers.
