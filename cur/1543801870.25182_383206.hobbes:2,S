MPTABLE in LinuxBIOS is put from 0x20, if the system has too many cpu
and devices (slots)  the mptable will get bigger than 0x464, so it
will use 0x40:67....
We need to put mptable to [0xf0000:0x100000] together with acpi tables.
and if it is bigger than 64k, then we have to put it on special
postion ...from 1K, and pass the posstion of mptable to the kernel via
command line.
I will update the code in LinuxBIOS.
Thanks
YH
