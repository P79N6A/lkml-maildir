There's also that OTG patch to merge ...
After I see this in mainline, I'll send any build fixes needed.
If musb-on-DaVinci can't make 2.6.27, it should be able to finally
make it in 2.6.29 ... :(
What would really suck is if the OMAP3 support manages to work
in mainline but DaVinci is still broken.  At the time the driver
was submitted (for 2.6.27), DaVinci was the only platform to
have a set of "everything works" patches submitted ...
