Are the crashes associated with any particular workload or device?  My
M6000 works perfectly.
The one big problem I had with is is the VIA Unichrome XAA driver had a
FIFO related bug that caused it to stall the PCI bus, delaying
interrupts for tens of ms unless "Option NoAccel" was used.
This bug was fixed over 6 months ago though.
