It is also similar to the experimental BSD vpath. There is a paper somewhere on 
this. Vpaths were stored in the kernel per-user as a stack. They then worked
rather like the makefile VPATH directive, indeed this is probably what inspired 
it.
A per-user vpath affected namei lookups. Apparently the kernel mods required
were small.
