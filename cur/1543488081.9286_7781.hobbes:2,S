Alan,
I'm still experiencing intermittant paging "storms" with 2.2.2-ac1. 
Anecdotally, it appears to be triggered by nfsd activity, however it's so
infrequent that I can't swear that's the cause.  The system churns away
for several minutes, with vmstat showing ~2500 si/sec.  Interactive
response goes to hell in a handbasket during this time.  When it settles
down, everything is just fine.
Anyone else seeing this?
Steve
