Always an option.  If elvtune didn't exist at all I'd say proc was a
better choice.  But I do want to be able to tune things on a per device
basis, which probably means a new directory tree somewhere in proc.  Our
chances are only 50/50 of getting that patch in without a long thread
about the one true way to access kernel tunables through an fs 
interface visible to userland ;-)
For the most part I'm only visiting drivers/block/*.c right now, so I'll
code whatever interface the long term maintainers hate the least.
