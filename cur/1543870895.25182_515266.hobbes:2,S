Getting the refault distance out of such a radix tree would be tricky.
One solution I can think of would entail keeping a global fault count
and storing the current fault count in the radix node and on refault
subtract from the global count. The downside however is this global
thing, perhaps we could do some smart percpu count aggregate to fix it.
The other point you mention is when to we reap these radix tree nodes,
normally nonresident information gets dropped once the distance is
further than our memory is big, but these nodes don´t have explicit
order.
The collapsing idea is interesting, esp. if we could delay the collapse
so that the avg refault distance would be in some relation to the error.
