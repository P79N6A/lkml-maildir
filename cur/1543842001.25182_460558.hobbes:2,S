Udev fixes this for most filesystems - except / which is cruical.
With / on raid-1 this is not a problem, as md autodetect will
assemble the arrays whether they are on ide or scsi.
But anyone with / on a partition can't easily switch
between sda/hda unless they also use an initrd.  The kernel
itself does not seem to support partition by label. :-(
