The netfilter hooks are placed in the network layer, therefore skb->h.th
is not set in the input path since the packet did not reach the
transport layer yet (prerouting/input), but it is set in the output path
because it already passed by the transport layer (output/postrouting).
BTW, I'm unsure that this can be of interest in the linux-kernel list,
please there's no need to cc everyone. Use netfilter or linux-net
instead next time.
