klogd maps the kernel messages from <n>text to syslog levels and does
some fiddling with kernel log levels at start up.  It needs to be more
than a simple 'cat'.  When symbol handling was added to klogd, ksymoops
was built into the kernel and very unreliable.  Since then ksymoops has
been moved to a separate package and is now reliable.  Alas oops
handling in sysklogd has not kept up to date and is now the problem
area.
