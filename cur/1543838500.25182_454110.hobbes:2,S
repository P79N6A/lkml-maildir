Are you saying that drivers/ide is binding to the NVIDIA SATA 
controller? That seems odd, at least in the Fedora Core 5 kernel 
configuration, drivers/ide would never try to bind to the SATA 
controllers for me, only sata_nv would. Maybe you have some 
configuration option turned on to make drivers/ide grab anything that 
looks like an IDE controller, which probably shouldn't be turned on.
