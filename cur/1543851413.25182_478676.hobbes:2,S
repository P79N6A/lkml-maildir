It's documented in Documentation/scsi/scsi_mid_low_api.txt:
    unchecked_isa_dma - 1=>only use bottom 16 MB of ram (ISA DMA addressing
                   restriction), 0=>can use full 32 bit (or better) DMA
                   address space

maybe ask on linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org (cc-ed)

Does anyone know that controller hardware and its limitations?
If the driver can't handle highmem addresses, you could just change
it so that
(a) it does not set unchecked_isa_dma
(b) it sets .slave_alloc in the host template and then does
like the <slave_alloc> function in ppa.c or imm.c:
call blk_queue_bounce_limit() to set an address for which bounce
buffers (from highmem to lowmem) will be used.
[I don't guarantee that to work for BusLogic.]
