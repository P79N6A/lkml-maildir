From a mathematical point of view this is a ceil(v)+1, so this is wrong.
It should be :
t = (t * HZ + 999) / 1000;
The +999 already gives you the round up. Different is if we want to be
sure to sleep at least that amount of jiffies ( the rounded up ), in that
case since the timer tick might arrive immediately after we go to sleep by
making us to lose immediately a jiffie, we need another +1. Anyway I'll do
the round up. Same for the overflow check.

I don't see why. The poll(2) timeout is an int.

True, I'll change it.
