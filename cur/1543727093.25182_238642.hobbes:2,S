Hi Neil,
it still occurs in 2.6.8rc3 in some way:
Server and client both running 2.6.8rc3. The client mounts the /dev
directory from the server *read-only always*:
- when the server exports its /dev ro, the client cannot echo sth.
   to the mounted dev/console
- when the server exports its /dev rw, the client can echo to dev/console,
   although it has mounted it ro.
A client running kernel 2.4 can echo to dev/console in both cases,
even with the server exporting /dev ro.
So I'm not sure if this is a client or server issue, but I guess that
Trond is reading NFS stuff here, too...
cu,
Frank
