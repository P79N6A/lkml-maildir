ROTFL! Most people need a debugger to analyse a core file.
If you just want the core file:
   dd if=/dev/null or=/core bs=1k count=42

Most people don't know what tool to use, wouldn't be able to use
the tool anyway, wouldn't know what a core file is, and wouldn't
even know that a core file gets dumped.
Developers don't get very good bug reports from such people.
With a user-oriented crash info tool, normal humans could provide
decent bug reports. Obviously a serious developer would start ddd
instead of the crash info tool. Tech support would want a tool that
sends email.
Core files are just not good. Once a program cores, all the file
descriptors are closed. All the interprocess relationships are
destroyed. You can't debug as well after all the connections
are severed.
