Actually I was wrong to think the patch wasn't in there just because it
didn't produce any output.

No, don't do that.  Keep USB_SUSPEND=n, and try only the most recent patch
I sent to Rafael:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115825076000987&w=2
I know for certain that some of Rafael's problems are different from 
yours, because his involve ehci-hcd and ohci-hcd whereas you have only 
UHCI controllers.
