In general, I like this.  However, I have to ask one question: how much
of the i386-centrism of this patch is actually necessary?  What
information does GDB _use_ from this, and is there some way we can
expose it that will be useful in other places?
Eventually most or all targets will have thread-specific data
implemented; I don't want to have to redo this for each one.
Your choice of numbers is fine if this remains i386-centric; if we
expect there to be a common interface then it should go in
<linux/ptrace.h> and the 0x4200 range instead.
