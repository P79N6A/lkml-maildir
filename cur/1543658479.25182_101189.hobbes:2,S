Linux itself, yes, it's definitely a special project in the context of
GNU and deserve to have it's identity preserved even outside of the
main core of GNU/GPL. It's special case all around.

Those folks were on the forefront of this and have special historical
status as a result of this.

Yes, but they were on the forefront of this and have special status and
should be held seperate from GNU/GPL itself.

The difference that respect about this project is that, although it's
has GPL roots, it has been a refactoring foundation for the entire
open source community. The rules were rewritten after the success of
this project. It's not ment to be a disrespect to you and what you've
done certainly, but it's definitely smashed the scale and scope
of free software projects.
Like when Metallica hit the Metal scene in 1984, it was a bit sterile
prior to that. :)

I'll read it again. :)
