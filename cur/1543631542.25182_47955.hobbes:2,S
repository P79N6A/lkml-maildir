Looks OK to me.  But I wonder if it should be inside some config
option - I don't think machines with saner memory architectures
would want this?

Can anyone actually write to an inode which is on the unused
list?

It seems that a call to try_to_free_buffers() has snuck into
invalidate_inode_pages().  That means that clean ext3 pages
which are on the checkpoint list won't be released.  Could you
please change that to try_to_release_page()?
