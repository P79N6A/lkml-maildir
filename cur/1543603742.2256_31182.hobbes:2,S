   The argument for supplying this functionality in the PCI DMA code
   would be that if it was done there it could be done once, and in a
   sophisticated and efficient (and SMP-safe :) fashion, rather than
   ad-hoc in each driver.
The argument against it is that if you provide such an easy way out,
people will just blindly transform bus_to_virt/virt_to_bus without
considering more straightforward methods when they exist.
I can not even count on one hand how many people I've helped
converting, who wanted a bus_to_virt() and when I showed them
how to do it with information the device provided already they
said "oh wow, I never would have thought of that".  That process
won't happen as often with the suggested feature.
I am adamently against generic infrastructure to do this.  Yes, it's
social engineering, tough cookies... it's social engineering that I
know is working :-)
Franks a lot,
