That's bogus on UP (spin_is_locked always returns 0).
I think it would be reasonably nice to have something like
spin_lock_held(spinlock_t *lock);
that returns 1 for UP and spin_is_locked(lock) for SMP - basically 
foo() 
{
	if (!spin_lock_held(&foo_lock))
		BUG();
	...
}
looks to me like it'll avoid errors more effectively than
/* Call with foo_lock held */
foo()
{
	...
}
