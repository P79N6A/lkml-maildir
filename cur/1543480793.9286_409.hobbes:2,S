Besides quotes, I would like to hear what these two fine gentlemen think of
the press release so far, and the idea in general.  Linus in particular seems
to have been silent so far.
Remaining quibbles with the press release follow.

Too colloquial.  How about "To cope with the expected demand for this upgrade,
the Linux Kernel Archive has established a worldwide network of mirror servers
from which the upgrade can be obtained."

Unclear.  How about "Another benefit of Linux and its open source nature is that
support contracts are available from vendors and numerous third parties."

Who?  Also, the quote contains poor grammar, and "superior to any OS created
across the earth" sounds less than professional.  I would lose this paragraph.

This paragraph is just about perfect; however what is meant by editing quotes?
If what is between the quotation marks differs at all from the original
document, this is legally dangerous.  At minimum you have to mark removed
material, etc.

I would lose this.  Too much paraphrasing for too little benefit.  Doesn't
add much.  If you need it, just keep the last sentence.
