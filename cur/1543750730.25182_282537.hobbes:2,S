But that cannot be. Splitting the developer base is guaranteed to
reduce the amount of critical examination and testing given to both
series of kernel versions.
Also, .com's have finite horizons and slow response times; dev kernels
are almost universally beyond them. A dedicated dev kernel with a short
development cycle guarantees that the entire corporate side will be
left out of the development cycle. And this is not speculation; even
the long dev cycles do similar, or are only given attention after their
huge freezes. If they're always too late for a slow-moving dev cycle a
fast-moving dev cycle is guaranteed to outrun them completely.
