Also, ia64 has a tendency to print an ugly message in the kernel log
for unaligned accesses.  Has anyone tried AoE on ia64?
It might be better to change the AoE code to use get_unaligned(), just
to document what's going on.  Although clearly the sparc64 patch is
correct as well -- we should never silently return the wrong data.
