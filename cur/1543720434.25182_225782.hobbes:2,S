There are a couple issues I was thinking of when
I wrote "clean it up, pull the bits together...":
	1) Tony Luck's question about what happens when
	   "shr.u r30 = r13, 12" yields zero in the 32-bit
	   lock value.  I'm not the 2.6 maintainer, but I'd
	   sure like to see some solution for this.  It would
	   be a nightmare to debug a system where one random
	   task didn't release locks correctly.  Since other
	   arches use a trick like this, I'm hoping they've
	   figured out something we can copy (I haven't looked).
	2) A nit-pick, but for things like this:
-                     "  mov r30 = 1;;\n\t"
+                     /* "  mov r30 = 1;;\n\t" */
+                     "  shr.u r30 = r13, 12;;\n\t"     /* Current task pointer */
	   just remove the old line, don't comment it out.
Thanks for collecting the bits.  I looked at it last week, got
derailed trying to figure out how the pre-gcc-3.3 lock contention
code worked (a comment there would have been helpful), and got
distracted.
