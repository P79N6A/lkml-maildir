I don't think there has been such a discussion. The Mission Critical
hackers were hired by RedHat and Dave Anderson continues to work on
crash and making it available at:
	
ftp://people.redhat.com/anderson
He's had about a release per month. I thought MCLX crash has some
strong points also. After I enhanced LKCD to support the ia64 I
fixed MCLX crash so it could read the new LKCD crash dumps which
are no longer monotonically increasing in memory. I did this to
support NUMA systems which can have more memory than swap space.
This way the most important memory can be saved first. 
If you read the lkcd-devel mailing list you can read our discussion
on maintaining MLCX crash on the lkcd cvs tree.

	 level is the way to do it."
