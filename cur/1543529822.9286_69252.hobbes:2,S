Subject: Fwd: PATCH: Linux locks when you try to mount volume and NFS server is down

If you do
/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop
/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs restart
and then some computer tries to mount a volume of the server, it locks.
Tracking down the problem, we could see that it happens if all the following
conditions are true:
- NFS server daemons [nfsd] are down;
- rpc.mountd is up;
- you run exportfs -a or exportfs -r; and of course
- if you try to mount some volume.
When a client tries to mount a NFS volume, it provokes the following function
calls in knfsd:
exp_rootfh -> fh_put -> add_to_fhcache -> find_fhe
find_fhe must return a file handle that already lies in the cache, OR an empty
space so add_to_fhcache can put the file handle in the cache. But, if NFS
server is down, the cache size becomes zero, and find_fhe does not return any
file handle nor an empty cache entry.
So add_to_fhcache tries to invalidade some old file handle (it will fail
because cache size is zero anyway) and will call find_fhe again, that will fail,
so it will try to invalidate something again and... we have an infinite loop
that locks the server.
The following patch makes add_to_fhcache test if nfsd_nservers is zero; if it
is, it will not loop because it knows the allocation will be unsucessfull
anyway. (It applies for kernel 2.2.14)
