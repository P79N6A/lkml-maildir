Maybe. Still the issue has been aggravated between 2.6.17 and 2.6.18.
Right now (running 2.6.17.13) I can backup and do whatever I want, even
with high memory pressure because of mysql (which is consumming right
now about 3.8GB of 4GB).
Under 2.6.18 and later it is simply impossible to perform that (except
with the dd directIO trick).
This makes me think that something else has joined the party on
2.6.18...

Yes, I already did this, and it helped, see:

I'll test the vfs_cache_pressure (I was already using those dirty_*
settings) whenever I'll reboot the server to 2.6.20.

Thanks for the tips.
