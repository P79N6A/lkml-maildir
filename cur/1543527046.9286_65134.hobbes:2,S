Yeah, but each Unix has it's own specialised tools which use these
files. We could (if we wanted) have a planned migration.

Yeah, as long as the "one-of-a-kind" devices don't proliferate. Which
has been known to happen (one look a /dev reveals this). Well, at
least now we can stop the rot. In my role as "gatekeeper", I won't
allow any new (non-directory) entries in the top-level of devfs unless
there's an awfully compelling reason for it.
