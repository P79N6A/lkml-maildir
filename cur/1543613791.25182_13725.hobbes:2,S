Thank you! I applied the patch and did a first quick and dirty test. 
After 20 restarts of X I coludn't detect any problem :-).
I will do a long term test from now on in order to see, if the problem 
appears again.
Is there a chance to get this patch in in vanilla kernel (maybe with 
some changes), if it really fixes the VIA timer bug?
Regards,
Andreas
