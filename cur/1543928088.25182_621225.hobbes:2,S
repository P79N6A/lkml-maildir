Quoting Casey Schaufler (casey@schaufler-ca.com):
> From: Casey Schaufler <casey@schaufler-ca.com>
> 
> This patch takes advantage of the increase in capability bits
> to allocate capabilities for Mandatory Access Control. Whereas
> Smack was overloading a previously allocated capability it is
> now using a pair, one for overriding access control checks and
> the other for changes to the MAC configuration.
> 
> The two capabilities allocated should be obvious in their intent.
> The comments in capability.h are intended to make it clear that
> there is no intention that implementations of MAC LSM modules
> be any more constrained by the presence of these capabilities
> than an implementation of DAC LSM modules are by the analogous
> DAC capabilities.

I do like the descriptions.
(Will wait for Andrew's comments to be addressed before reviewing the
rest)
