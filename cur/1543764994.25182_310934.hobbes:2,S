I've been thinking about this too. (I won't have time to implement this
however. If I do have time in the near future to do anything involving
git, it probably won't have anything to do with version control of
config files.)

I was thinking that the GIT checkin should actually be done by the
distro configuration tools, and not as a cronjob. And maybe the config
tools could do two checkins if there were any manual changes since the
last checkin, or something. (That is, one checkin to check in the manual
changes since the last checkin, and another to check in whatever the
config tool just did.)
Now that I think about it, it would be really good to have a simple tool
for doing a manual checkin after manual editing of config files, but I
think something like the dual-checkin scheme would be needed as a safety
net in case root forgets to do the checkin.
