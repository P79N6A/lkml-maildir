And all of this with tiff2bin being the obvious `guilty

I have an (old) patch that does try to find the `guilty
party' and get rid of that, and only that. I'll soon move
house and have a test machine (at the office); then I'll
port the patch to 2.2.14 and 2.3.<new> and will fix the
last few bugs in it.
People without that patience are welcome to take a look at
my patches page, grab the (old) OOM killer patch and do the
obvious things (compiling, reading it, sending me comments,
etc)...
