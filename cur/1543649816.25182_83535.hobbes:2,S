Test results on some PC-9800 (including not CS4232 chip),
snd-cs4232 driver works fine with snd_isapnp=0 snd_cport=-1 options.
Thanks for your advice.
Another problem, I'm tring to separate mpu401 driver for PC-9800.
To do this, I need to patch many files. So I think previus patch is
better than separated driver. How do you think?
