   rsync torvalds@penguin.transmeta.com:/home/torvalds/src/linux \
	   ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/LIVE/linux
   would be the real helper for people like me whose only real issue
   now is bothering Linus all the time to make pre-patches so I can send
   him known clean diffs.
This is orthogonal to the patch management system, but I agree this
would be highly useful.  Would Linus be willing to have an hourly cron
job that rsync'ed his live kernel sources to ftp.kernel.org?  (I suspect
a number of patch submitters would then have rsync jobs that would sync
from kernel.org to their local directories.  I know I would.)
It would certainly make it easier to send clean patches to Linus.
