This works on a HP Compaq nc4000 which previously never comes back
from resume (except for one time in which case the kernel oopsed in a
strange way, as posted by Matthew the other day).  I see a yellow
'Linu' on the screen, then I hear the hard drive spinning up, the
screen comes back and I see 'Restarting tasks... done' on the serial
console.  (this is with init=/bin/bash console=ttyS0)
