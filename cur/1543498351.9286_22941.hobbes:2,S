"persistent" as in connections that are re-used for multiple requests?
Yes, I think it should work even for a socket that has already been used
for another transfer: the kernel can do one (or more) static content
transfers over the same socket, and then when it gets a request it cannot
handle it just passes the socket to user space as if it was new. 
Sure, it's not really a new socket, but there isn't any way user space can
know, so a standard apache or any other server would just never have seen
the original requests on that socket. We may have to "fake" a header or
similar on it, but at least it doesn't sound conecptually all that hard. 
There may be implementation issues that make it impossible, of course. I
have by no means looked very deply at the problem set.
