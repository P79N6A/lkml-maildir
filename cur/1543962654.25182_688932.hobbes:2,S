Hi all ,
I'm testing current git on 3 boxes and all got these annoying messages so far on 32bit kernels on all 3 ..
( After a quick scan on LKML posted dmesg's from current git I see a lot such messages too )
Could someone please explain why my HW is broken and why this 'BIOS bug' message is only
relevant on 32bit ? 
generic_processor_info() in apic_64.c does not have such an check. If is a HW bug then why not ?
Assuming my HW is really broken , why is this message displayed 4 times when it should be there just once for CPU#0 ?
Thx,
Gabriel C
