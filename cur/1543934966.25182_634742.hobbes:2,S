this holds a series of problems, we've applied everything we wanted to 
2.6.24 already we'll do the full stack of fixes for this in 2.6.25. 
(changing printk was deemed inappropriate so late in the -rc cycle) So 
perhaps mark this as WILL_FIX_LATER and unmark it as a regression? 
Stefano, do you agree? b43 works fine for you in the latest .24-rc 
kernel, correct?
