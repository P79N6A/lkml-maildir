Well I guess you must have missed where I asked him if he would be happy if I 
changed +5 metrics to do whatever he wanted and he refused to answer me. That 
would easily fit within that scheme. Any percentage of nice value he chose. I 
suggest 50% of nice 0. Heck I can even increase it if he likes. All I asked 
for was an answer as to whether that would satisfy his criterion.

I have been civil. Only one email crossed the line on my part and I apologise.
