Arch code. Arch code. Arch code ;-) Or at least base it of nr_cpus or 
numnodes. Seriously ... a 2x or 4x opteron obviously needs different
parameters from a 16x x440 or a 512x SGI box ... why we have a flexible
infrastructure that can stand on its head and do backflips, and then
we don't use it at all is a mystery to me ;-)
I'd even go so far as to suggest there should be NO default settings for
NUMA, only in arch code - that'd make people actually think about it.
If there are, they should be based off the topo infrastructure, not static
values.

Nick would know better than I, but I think so ... it seems to cope with
arbitrary levels, groupings, ... gravitational dimensions, etc ;-)
