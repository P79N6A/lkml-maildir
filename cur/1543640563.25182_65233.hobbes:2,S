My apologies if you meant 30%
<rant>
Arrgh!  Please explain the math.  How can something be more
than 100% smaller than something else.
I know it is OT but this marketing math really bugs me.
i've yet to see anyone explain how y = x - (3x) where x < 0
and y <= 0 can yield a positive number without first proving
-1 == 1.
