You can poll or IPI. An IPI has the problem that IPI's are horribly slow
on Pentium II/III. On the other hand the Athlon and PIV seem to both have
that bit sorted.
Its really an implementation detail as to whether you poll for work or
someone kicks you. Since we know what the other processors are doing and
who is idle we know when we need to kick them.
