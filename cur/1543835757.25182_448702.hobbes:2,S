Hi!
Rafael has patches to add bdev freezing to swsusp. I'd like to know if
they are neccessary (and why).
1) Is sync() enough to guarantee that all the data written before sync
actually reach the platters?
(Or is it that data only reach the journal? OTOH that would be okay, too).
2) If we stop all the user proceses and all the kernel threads, is
that enough to prevent XFS from writing to disk?
