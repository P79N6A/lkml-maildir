See, the thing Larry didn't hear was Garloff _actually_ said:
   "Sorry Larry, I can't [*in good conscience*] control Pavel [*like that*]."
No to mention that it _isn't_ Garloff's problem.
I wonder who are the "leading kernel developers" that Larry mentions.
Probably giggling in the background after their practical joke
actually worked :)
On a more straight-faced note, perhaps Larry thought a BK clone was being
developed _at SuSE_?  That would make it a less stupid request.
