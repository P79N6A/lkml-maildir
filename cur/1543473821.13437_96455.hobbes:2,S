I sent in one of those reports. Some testing I did over Christmas revealed that
the problem exists ONLY when I use the Accelerated X server (v. 4.1.2) combined
with the matroxfb framebuffer console. 
matroxbf and the XFree86 SVGA server (v 3.3.3) get along just fine, it seems.
So that's what I'm running now :-)
All of this on a Matrox G200 AGP card, running 1024x768.
