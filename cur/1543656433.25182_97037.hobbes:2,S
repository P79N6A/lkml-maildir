First thing, can you split this into much smaller pieces, each of
which perform one code change ... then it might be more feasible 
to read it.

You seem to have lost turning on CONFIG_X86_NUMA.

Errrm ... on by default?

Don't use those arrays directly, use the macros.
And that was off before for NUMA-Q ... you seem to have turned it on.
Unless you've inverted the meaning of clustered_apic_mode, which is
going to confuse the hell out of everyone?

OK, what exactly are your switching rules here? Before:
if (clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_NUMAQ)   -> numaq only
if (clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_XAPIC)   -> x440
if (clustered_apic_mode)                           -> numaq or x440
Make sure you match that switching logic in whatever you do.
For instance, this whole section gets skipped for NUMA-Q, but not
other NUMA machines.

If that's the direct substitution you're trying to make, don't misname
NUMAQ stuff as NUMA - very confusing ...
OK ... I give up trying to read the rest of it until you explain the
switching rules you're trying to use ... perhaps they're just confusingly
named, but it looks all wrong to me ...
