Just to let people know there's a new version of Petr's ongoing work
with the matrox framebuffer available:
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/
the file is called mga-2.5.65.gz, and it works wonderfully.
As far as I know, this patch was only announced on the fbdev-developers
mailing-list. I assume there are more matrox-users here.
Good luck,
Jurriaan
