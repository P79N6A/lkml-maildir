A possible compromise would be to limit the set of commands that you can
send to a known good set that's common among all drives unless you've got
CAP_SYS_RAWIO (or whatever's appropriate). That way, if I've got a server
where I know I'm only going to need to send drive-specific commands
occasionally, I can drop that capability from the default set when I'm
running multiuser, and reboot into single-user mode if I need to do drive
maintenance.

Exactly. It's just that it would be nice to have a way of permanently
revoking _just_ that permission when we know we won't need it any more.
Just out of interest, does anyone know what OpenBSD does about checking raw
IDE/SCSI commands? It sounds like the sort of thing that they might be
interested in.
