Probably acked-by was more appropriate.
James, is this considered needed-for-2.6.22?

ot: all the unlikely()s are irksome.  I wonder if there was some way of
doing this in security_file_permission() instead.  eg:
static inline int security_file_permission (struct file *file, int mask)
{
	int ret = security_ops->file_permission (file, mask);
	if (likely(ret == 0))
		return 0;
	return ret;
}
