How do you tell to kernel how to switch pixclock? It is done by non-vga
registers...

Look into linux-2.1.125 package... I believe that it was in...

Through non-VGA registers only. And you must change it when you change
pixclock. And if every console has different size, you must change
pixclock...

Type of card is not interesting. How to program such beast is interesting
thing...

Yes. But it is not up to date with latest hardware.

I have to go to to train station and left Prague just now, unfortunately.
If you will not find it before Monday, ask me again and I dig through
my archives.
