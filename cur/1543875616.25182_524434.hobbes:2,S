Hi,
since some weeks i try to get my new hardware running:
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU          6300  @ 1.86GHz
Intel DP965LT Mainboard
Seagate SATA-Harddisk in AHCI-Mode
After some hours of running or after some heavy file-i/o
(find / | cpio -padm /test) I always get a corrupted
XFS-filesystem.
I used already the following Kernels:
2.6.19.2
2.6.19.7
2.6.20.2
2.6.20.4
After xfs_repair I get damaged files in lost+found.
I read in newsgroups that the write-cache of the harddisk
should be turned of, but the messages are all very old.
Is it still true, that it should be switched of? At startup
I get the following line:
[    6.820776] SCSI device sda: write cache: enabled, read cache: 
enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
So I wonder if it should be on or off.
I also often get a sata-bus-reset with the kernels 2.6.19.2
and 2.6.20.2.
What can I do to find the problem? I think about to change
from xfs to ext2 but the filesystemcheck every 30 mounts lasts
a long time.
Do you have any Idea?
Which kernel is at the moment a so called stable? Stable enough
for my hardware?
Thanks a lot
Oliver Joa
