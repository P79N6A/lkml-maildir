A significant bugfix for forking tasks was just posted, so here is an updated 
version of the staircase deadline cpu scheduler. This may cause noticeable
behavioural improvements under certain workloads (such as compiling software 
with make).
Thanks to Al Boldi for making me check the fork code!

Renicing X to -10, while not essential, is preferable.
See the patch just posted called 'sched: implement staircase scheduler yaf 
fix' for full changelog.
