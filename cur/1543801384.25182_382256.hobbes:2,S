Do you have the patch to filter bad values? I submitted one. You
rejected it, because it does not support D1. Never mind that original
code does not support D1, either. [Should I retransmit the patch?]
If you suggest to just add check for == 0 or == 2... I think I can do
that, but that's going to break userspace, anyway (it passes _3_
there) and have no reasonable path to sane interface.

There may be more than "D1" and "D2" between "D0" and "D3". There may
be two different ways to put particular device into D1 sleep. This
means buses and devices contributing states, and all this is
complexity noone really wants.

Exporting multiple states is quite a lot of code, and it needs driver
changes. There's no clear benefit.

Ok, now we have a concrete example. So Radeon supports D1. But putting
radeon into D1 means you probably want to blank your screen and turn
the backlight off; that takes *long* time anyway. So you can simply
put your radeon into D3 and save a bit more power.
So yes, Radeon supports D1, but we probably do not want to use it.
[You may still want to do D1 on radeon for
debugging/testing/something. Fine, but we are trying to build
power-management infrastructure, not debugging one.]
