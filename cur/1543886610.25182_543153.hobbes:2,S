Here's what I have so far, I cache the mount point of the container
and add the container path to it. I'm now stuck examining tasks,
while walking through a bunch of tasks, there is no easy way of
knowing the container path of the task without walking all subsystems
and then extracting the containers absolute path.

I was planning on using a hierarchical scheme, top 8  bits for
the container hierarchy and bottom 24 for a unique id. The id
is automatically selected. Once we know the container id, we'll
need a more efficient mechanism to map the id to the container.

Sure, the plan is to build a containerstats interface like taskstats.
In taskstats, we exchange data between user space and kernel space
using genetlink sockets. We have a push and pull mechanism for statistics.
