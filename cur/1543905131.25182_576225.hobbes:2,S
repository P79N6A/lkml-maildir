Yup, I think so too ...

I think we could get rid of the !dev check itself. Actually, the IFF_UP
check /also/ looks suspect to me for two reasons: (1) I remember Stephen
Hemminger once telling me dev->flags is legacy and unsafe, and one of
the netif_xxx() functions be used instead, and, (2) I wonder if we really
require the interface to be up and *running* when we do this ioctl.
