Thanks for your report.
A git-bisect might be a bit of overkill considering that there were only 
two patches applied beween 2.6.16.4 and 2.6.16.5:
Andi Kleen (2):
      x86_64: Clean up execve
      x86_64: When user could have changed RIP always force IRET (CVE-2006-0744)
I've attached both patches.
Could you manually bisect first applying "x86_64: Clean up execve" 
(patch-2.6.16.4-5-1) against 2.6.16.4?
Then we'll know which of Andi's pacthes caused this bug.

    [PATCH] x86_64: When user could have changed RIP always force IRET (CVE-2006-0744)
    Intel EM64T CPUs handle uncanonical return addresses differently from
    AMD CPUs.
    The exception is reported in the SYSRET, not the next instruction.
    Thgis leads to the kernel exception handler running on the user stack
    with the wrong GS because the kernel didn't expect exceptions on this
    instruction.
    This version of the patch has the teething problems that plagued an
    earlier version fixed.
    This is CVE-2006-0744
    Thanks to Ernie Petrides and Asit B. Mallick for analysis and initial
    patches.
