I can confirm the behavior you are seeing -- does seem to be a leak
somewhere.  Below from a heavily used gateway with 26 days uptime:
# wc -l /proc/net/rt_cache ; grep ip_dst /proc/slabinfo
  12870 /proc/net/rt_cache
ip_dst_cache       53327  57855
Eventually I get the dst_cache overflow errors and have to reboot.
