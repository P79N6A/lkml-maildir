IMHO ...
the main reason is that ext4 would be treated as a new generation
fs which will be used for lots of new features probably. and it
will take long to get into production-ready state. at the same
time, proposed patches (at least extents itself) are heavily
tested in production and could be made available for our users
very soon.
thanks, Alex
