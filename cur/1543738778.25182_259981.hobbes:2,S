Yeah but this is quite different.
We already have device mapper "like" functionality in v2.4 with RAID/LVM. 
I dont think that mergin device mapper is an option really, not in my opinion.
It seems the general consensus is to merge iswraid, so I'm fine with it.
Martins, we are approaching -rc stage, I would prefer the merge to happen 
at the beginning of 2.4.29-pre. Is that fine for you?
