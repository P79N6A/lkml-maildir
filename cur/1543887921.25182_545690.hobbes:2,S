I guess I'm not seeing the race with rmmod that you're talking
about? In XPC's case, rmmod calls xpc_exit() which currently does a
wait_for_completion() on the discovery thread and on the other thread
mentioned above. These will be changed to kthread_stop() calls.  And if
the discovery thread has already exited the kthread_stop() will return
immediately and if not it will wait until the discovery thread has
exited. rmmod won't return from xpc_exit() until both threads have exited.
Any thought as to when the changes to kthread_stop() that allow it to be
called for a kthread that has already exited will get into the -mm tree?

Again, when xpc_exit() is called by rmmod it waits for XPC's pool of
threads to exit before it returns, so not a problem.
Any thought as to when kthread_orphan() will get into the -mm tree? Once
kthread_stop() is changed and kthread_orphan() added I can proceed with
a patch to change XPC to use the kthread API.

Robin has changed his mind about tieing in the management of a pool
of threads with the kthread API, so there won't be the fore mentioned
proposal.
Thanks,
