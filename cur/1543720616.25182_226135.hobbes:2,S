Current fs/binfmt_elf.c creates at most one ".bss" area, regardless of
how many PT_LOAD have .p_filesz < .p_memsz.  The .bss area always
has PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ page protection, regardless of .p_flags.
Thus "Linux doesn't" do as faithful a job as it could with ELF.
I submitted "elfdiet" and "bssprot" patches a couple months ago
to address these issues.  The bssprot patch appeared briefly in -mm
for 2.6.[56], but was dropped because of ARCH pain, particularly
with the sn2 variant of ia64.  The hardware is scarce, and the topic
was not sufficiently interesting for those with access to such a box.
