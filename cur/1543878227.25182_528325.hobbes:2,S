That's not what CodingStyle is trying to control.  Not "what the
code looks like" at all.
Think why this line is here at the end of Chapter 1.
    Get a decent editor and don't leave whitespace at the end of lines.
By the way, "git show --color 0aa599c -- drivers/usb/net/usbnet.h"
would catch this kind of breakage if you have git.
