Hi, Andrew,
I've added a definition of containerstats_build() even when CONFIG_CONTAINERS
is turned off, it simply returns -EINVAL. That's why taskstats.c compiles,
I could add an #ifdef and move the containers commands under CONFIG_CONTAINERS,
but I felt taskstats.c could be clean without any #ifdef's hanging around
(as much as possible).
In the next iteration, I could move out all the code to containerstats.c
and make containerstats.c depend on CONFIG_CONTAINERS
