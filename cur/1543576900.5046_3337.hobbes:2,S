Yes, we need to add one field to the in-core superblock to do this accounting.

Yes, I was thinking at this callback too. Such a callback is nearly the only
support we need from the filesystem to provide allocate on flush. Allocate on
flush is a pagecache issue, not really a filesystem issue. When a filesystem
doesn't implement such callback we can simply get_block(create) at pagecache
creation time as usual.
