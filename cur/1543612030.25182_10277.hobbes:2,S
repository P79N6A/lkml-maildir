ok, i'm learning here ;)
it seems i guessed wrong, and schedule() wakes up on a wait queue which 
has been added by poll_wait; poll_wait doesn't actually do any sleeping 
so no loop is necessary in i810_poll; it will be called again by do_poll 
or do_select after the call to schedule. so no latency and no problem.
right?
