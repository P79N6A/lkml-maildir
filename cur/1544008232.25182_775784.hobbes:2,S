Yes. If we have SIGKILL in ->shared_pending, we must have it in
in ->pending too.
The only exception is when we send SIGKILL to the already dying task
which has already dequeued SIGKILL from ->pending. And we do have a
special case: coredumping. elf_core_dump() does get_user_pages()
when the process is "almost" dead, it has SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT.
So, if get_user_pages() calls sigkill_pending() instead of
fatal_signal_pending(), this can help. But:
	- this relies on the fact that we always queue SIGKILL
	  even if the task is dead. This behaviour can be changed.
	- this doesn't stop the coredumping, it will continue
	  with DUMP_SEEK(). Yes, this is better if we want to
	  stop this thread to populate the memory, but I think
	  we should just fix the coredumping - it should be
	  interruptible.
Actually, the patch exists:
