Unfortunately, on bus 0, which is always the main bus of a system, there
is no such thing as normal.  The BIOS knows how the mainboard is wired
and hence knows how to assign IRQs.  It is only ones you get past bus 0
and onto secondary busses behind bridges that fixed rules apply since
that is when things have to work universally.  So in your case, via can
do whatever they want with IRQs for each DN, since they know the layout
of the mainboard.  The problem with riser cards without a pci bridge
chip, is that they try to modify bus 0 without the knowledge of the
board maker, which means the bios won't have a clue how it is wired.
Use of any riser card not explicitly supported by the board is hence
unsupported and really not recommended.
