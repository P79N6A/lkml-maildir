Knowing whether a translation is current or not would be useful ... perhaps
the translated files could include the GIT blob SHA1 of the version they
were translated from (and some human readable version string too :-)
This would allow someone reading the documentation to know whether
is really was current.  If it isn't, it provides an easy path to see what
changed in the source document since the translation was made. This
same diff should lighten the load for people maintaining the translation.
