I don't see how git could tell you to Cc net patches to 
netdev@vger.kernel.org.

Auke suggestion of an additional field in MAINTAINERS makes sense - and 
it leaves it to the maintainers to maintain it similar to the other 
information there.
Independent of whatever software Dan wants to write it would also solve 
problems like the one that MAINTAINERS currently isn't really good in 
telling e.g. who is maintaining drivers/net/wireless/.

It might depend on what use cases you think of and whom you expect to 
use it.
For me, a tool that simply tells me whom to Cc for a patch would be a 
great tool.
What you suggest would be something completely different.
