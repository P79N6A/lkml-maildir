It's really just a represent the community type of role.  The LF uses
the TAB to get a sense of the community for various things they and
their members are thinking.  Conversely, the TAB was initially formed to
get a set of specific objectives out of the then OSDL (Doc Fellowship,
Travel Fund, NDA programme and HW lending library plus a few other
things).  The TAB takes proposals from the community for things it needs
that require an organisation to sort out (a good example of this is the
currently being acted on PCI sig membership, which will give us access
to the PCI specs plus a vendor ID that the virtualisation people asked
for to help with virtual device recognition).

The procedure is to read statements before the election in a BOF at the
Kernel Summit, so the order is statements first then voting.

The base requirement is just someone you trust to look after the
interests of the community and correctly reflect them back to the LF.  I
think someone who had concrete proposals to make the LF better or to
come up with new ways it could help the community would be on to a
winner ... but then I'm a bit naïve when it comes to trusting democracy.
