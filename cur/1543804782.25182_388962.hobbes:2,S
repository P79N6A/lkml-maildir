That's why there's a maintenance/stable branch of most every single 
project, commercial or otherwise, and a development branch.  Development 
for new hardware continues, and for people who need these pieces of 
hardware which require major changes to work, then this much more limited 
set of users can take the rest of the issues that follow with using a dev 
kernel, until the stable branch moves up to/off/after the point at which 
the development branch got support for their new hardware.
A *lot* of us are using Linux for servers or other things that don't change 
every month.
And I'm not seeing/saying this sort of thing would stick forever, but a '6 
month cycle' or something of that nature.  Partly because of this I don't 
forsee myself having time to really start work on this for another month or 
two since I have to go into devel/bunker and get things working now at the 
demand of other entities than myself.
This thread has shown that there is desire for such a thing atleast by a 
few.  I'm just sure it's not a one man job, I've also been given a pointer 
that there is a stable team and I've yet to have time to go in that 
direction (really stirred the ants nest with this one).
