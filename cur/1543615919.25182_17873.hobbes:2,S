Hi Ingo...
	Reading through 2.5.2-C1, couple of comments/questions:
sched.c line 402:
	/*
	 * Current runqueue is empty, try to find work on
	 * other runqueues.
	 *
	 * We call this with the current runqueue locked,
	 * irqs disabled.
	 */
	static void load_balance(runqueue_t *this_rq)
This first comment doesn't seem to be true: it also seems to be called
from idle_tick and expire task.  Perhaps it'd be nicer too, to split
load_balance into "if (is_unbalanced(cpu())) pull_task(cpu())".  (I
like "pull_" and "push_" nomenclature for the scheduler).
sched.c load_balance() line 435:
		if ((load > max_load) && (load < prev_max_load) &&
						(rq_tmp != this_rq)) {
Why are you ignoring a CPU with more than the previous maximum load
(prev_max_load is incremented earlier)?
sched.c expire_task line 552:
	if (p->array != rq->active) {
		p->need_resched = 1;
		return;
	}
I'm not clear how this can happen??
Finally, I gather you want to change smp_processor_id() to cpu()?
That's fine (smp_num_cpus => num_cpus() too please), but it'd be nice
to have that as a separate patch, rather than getting stuck with BOTH
cpu() and smp_processor_id().
Patch below (untested) corrects SMP_CACHE_BYTES alignment, minor
comment, and rebalance tick for HZ < 100 (ie. User Mode Linux).
Rusty.
PS. Awesome work.
