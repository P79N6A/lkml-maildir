Subject: 2.2.20-pre11 fails to compile (still)

I sent a similar report to the list earlier. I've had some more time to look at
the problem myself, but 2.2.20-pre11 still fails to compile for me, as it stops
in the changes in process.c, signal.c and traps.c. Examples of the errors are:
-------
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.20/arch/i386/kernel'
cc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.20/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer  -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586   -c -o process.o process.c
process.c: In function `sys_execve':
process.c:812: structure has no member named `ptrace'
process.c:812: `PT_DTRACE' undeclared (first use this function)
process.c:812: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
process.c:812: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [process.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.20/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
-------
I reverted the change:
-               current->flags &= ~PF_DTRACE;
+               current->ptrace &= ~PT_DTRACE;
and process.c then compiled. However, signals.c then hit a problem with the
following change:
-              if ((current->flags & PF_PTRACED) && signr != SIGKILL) {
+              if ((current->ptrace & PT_PTRACED) && signr != SIGKILL) {
After reverting that, the compile then stops in traps.c:
-------
cc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.20/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer  -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586   -c -o traps.o traps.c
traps.c: In function `do_debug':
traps.c:383: structure has no member named `ptrace'
traps.c:383: `PT_DTRACE' undeclared (first use this function)
traps.c:383: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
traps.c:383: for each function it appears in.)
traps.c:383: `PT_PTRACED' undeclared (first use this function)
make[1]: *** [traps.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.20/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
-------
I believe these changes are related to the SUID ptrace fixes, but why am I
missing the definitions for these symbols? I can keep on reverting the changes
to get it compiled, but I'd rather figure out what's going wrong.
The system is an old Slackware 3.6 box with libc5 (ver 5.4.46).
