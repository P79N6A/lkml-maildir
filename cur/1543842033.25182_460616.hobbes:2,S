I was playing around with the bc patches and found that to make
use of bc's, I had to actually call set_bcid() and then exec() a
task/shell so that the id would stick around. Would you consider
changing sys_set_bcid to sys_set_task_bcid() or adding a new
system call sys_set_task_bcid()? We could pass the pid that we
intend to associate with the new id. This also means we'll need
locking around to protect task->task_bc.
