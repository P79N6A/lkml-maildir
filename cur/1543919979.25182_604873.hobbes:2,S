Yes, but continuing as before keeping it aside of everything also
hurts. I'm convinced that the roadmap which I aim at is fine there is
code which works and which is valueable for other projects.
What's the idea behind a forced separation? - One and the same code is
also used as it is in Windows drivers. If someone wants to commit his
free time in fixing or improving that work he's welcome to do so by
touching it once 3 targets are affected. The roadmap also includes OSX
which would be the 4th target.
What's the value of having those shareable components which have a
full implementation limited to linux which only supports a limited
subset of those features (and it requires a rewrite to get it fit into
the kernel, so those features will very likely get stripped off - this
is the current way how it's done)?
