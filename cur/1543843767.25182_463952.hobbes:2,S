Hi!

Basically looks good to me.

This should go to Documentation/, somewhere.
Why the cuppability name?

This is reverted from normal meaning, now?

Yep, it seems so.

Now this is what I'd call a hack...

                      ~
		      \- you should avoid this space.

Hmm, meaning is really inverted CUP_NONE means "forbid nothing".. not
forbid everything... right?

Hmm, probably not...
