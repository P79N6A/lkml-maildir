What bleeding edge system support MPS and does not support ACPI?

I belive we don't touch the IO_APICS in either MPS or ACPI mode before
setup_IO_APIC.

If the goal of this patch is to restore the hardware to the state
that it was before Linux scribbed on it, then it might be a better
ideal to save/restore the actual register values the BIOS gave us rather
than writing hard-coded values, no?
