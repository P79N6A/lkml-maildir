I'm having a problem booting 2.6.0-test6-mm(2-4) when using an initrd.
Seems that the initrd never gets loaded, and the root filesystem never
gets mounted as a result. Reverting RD0-initrd-B6.patch allows initrd to
work again, and my machine to boot. I'm using a standard non-initramfs
initrd and a devfs enabled SMP kernel. I don't see any of the printk's
regarding ramdisk/initrd in any boot messages prior to panic. Let me
know if you need anything else. Thanks,
-Walt
