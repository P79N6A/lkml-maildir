On the good run, I don't get any message, which is good.
On the bad run, I got the following message ...
boston kernel: nf_ct_tcp: invalid packed ignored IN= OUT=

This message is displayed repeatedly after the job got "stuck", once
ever 3 seconds coinciding with every 3 seconds of the print job sent.
Hope this helps.
Jeff.
