Subject: [2.6.0] autonegotiation broken with 3c905C
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

On Linux 2.6.0 (and earler -test versions), the card is stuck in
10-BaseT half-duplex mode, at least according to mii-tool.  The abysmal
TCP performance for bulk transfers *from* that host suggests that it's
true. 8-(
Boot messages are:
kernel: 3c59x: Donald Becker and others. www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
kernel: 0000:00:08.0: 3Com PCI 3c905C Tornado at 0xd000. Vers LK1.1.19
"lspci -v" shows the following output:
00:08.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905C-TX/TX-M [Tornado] (rev 30)
        Subsystem: 3Com Corporation 3C905C-TX Fast Etherlink for PC Management NIC
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        I/O ports at d000 [size=128]
        Memory at e3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=128K]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
Any suggestions?
(The card is fine with 2.4.21.)
