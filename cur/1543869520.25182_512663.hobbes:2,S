For this set_up_list3s() case, it is not a fatal since it is only
called during early bootstrap phase.  But anyway I think we should
detect these case at compile time.
I found refenrence_*.pl was removed on these commits at 2.6.17:

Reviving these perl scripts looks overkill for me.
This is a dirty hack to check all built-in.o just after linking
vmlinux.  But this can not detect mismatches in libs.a files, and
modpost fails with "... is truncated" message on empty built-in.o
files.
Maybe checking at each $(LD) invocation should detect all mismatches,
but I'm not familer with kbuild to do it by myself.  Could someone
make perfect solution?
