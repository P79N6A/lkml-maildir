I reversed only the irq.c part of my new bh_atomic patch. This way I think
that disable_bh() could race only if it's run from an irq handler
(probably unlikly to happens), but otherwise it' s safe... The console.c
case is still fixed this way.
The synchronize_bh doesn't synchronize if it's run from an irq handler so
we could consider the irq case a special not bh_atomic_safe case? Or
should we go always safe using a spinlock and do many __cli()?
