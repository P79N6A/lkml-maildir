Most programs suck: they're written by programmers who, due to ignorance
or lack of time, don't check for errors they should.  The fact that brk(),
sbrk(), and malloc() all can return errors is irrelevent- they aren't
checked.  Is this an excuse to not return an error value?  Even something
as simple as popping up a dialog box (which CAN be done- WindowMaker does
it) instead of simply dying quietly (and leaving a core file behind- the
default behavior of SIGSEGV) improves the user experience enormously.
