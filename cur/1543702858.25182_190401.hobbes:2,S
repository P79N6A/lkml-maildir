As you don't say if you have checked it, here goes my suggestion:
First of all, you should assure there's no process doing reads [*] that
cause a cache miss (eg. daemons like postfix that check the queue every
few seconds). You can tell this running vmstat 1 and see that bi and bo
[**] stay at 0.
For example, I've observed that fetchmail (using imaps protocol, with
exim as mta) triggers a disk read that spins up the disk _always_
(regardless of what's in the cache). However, I must confess I have'nt
tracked it down (or even looked at any source code).
[*] Processes making disk writes are supposed to be "harmless", because
laptop-mode will delay those writes to disk (that's what it's supposed
to do! ;).
[**] And that's why vmstat's bo is supposed to stay at 0.
