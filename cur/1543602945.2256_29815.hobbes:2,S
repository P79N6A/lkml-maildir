          Hello there, time has come i think to update the link for
    the lkml web archive. Since uwsg one is somewhat too laggy for me
    i switched quite long ago to http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel
       The strong side of this archive is the intelligent sorting scheme
    (it places updated threads to the top), and the fact that it lags
    for around 5 minutes, while uwsg one once lagged for a week...
Cheers, Samium Gromoff
