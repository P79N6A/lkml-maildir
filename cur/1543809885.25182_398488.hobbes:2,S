It's a bit unusual to add boot-time tunables via module_param, but there's
no law against it.
But you do get arrested for not adding them to
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt.  That's if you think they're permanent
(I hope they aren't).  If they are, they'll probably need a more extensive
description than kernel-parameters.txt entries normally provide.
