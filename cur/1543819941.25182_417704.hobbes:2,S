Thank you for your reply.

Sorry, to post it multiple times. Actually, two places netfilter and 
then kernel bugzilla. I made the second report after it appeared 
there'd would be no feedback to the first one and another kernel 
revision had been issued with the problem still evident. (The first 
feedback on the netfilter report crossed in the mail with the kernel 
report.)

Yep, that's it. How could one know that there is such a module called 
xt_tcpudp.ko, especially since there is no corresponding config 
option? Wouldn't up-to-date and complete documentation explain how to 
set up the kernel config and indicate which modules should be loaded?
On the other hand, shouldn't this module be loading automatically?
