IMO...  Tejun is an excellent counter-example.  He showed up as an 
independent developer, put a bunch of his own spare time and energy into 
the codebase, and is probably libata's main engineer (in terms of code 
output) today.  If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I think the Linux 
community would be quite happy with him as the libata maintainer.

I think Tejun is a counter-example here too :)  Everyone's experience is 
different, but from my perspective, Tejun "appeared out of nowhere" 
producing good code, and so, it got merged rapidly.
Personally, for merging code, I tend to trust people who are most in 
tune with "the Linux Way(tm)."  It is hard to quantify, but quite often, 
independent developers "get it" when enterprise developers do not.

Indeed...
