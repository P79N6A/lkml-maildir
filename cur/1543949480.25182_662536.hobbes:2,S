Oh.. you killed sg list manipulation.  Many controllers do allow odd
bytes as the last sg entry but not all.  Also, if you append drain
buffer after it, it ends up with unaligned sg entry in the middle and
rq->data_len + rq->extra_len will overrun the sg entry after the drain
page which is really dangerous.
