There are benefits to macros too.  One that I like for debuggin is that
the C parser will unravel a macro within the context of the execution:
#ifdef DEBUG
#define KMALLOC(x,y) \
  printk(__FILE__ ":%d: kmalloc(%d,%d")\n", __LINE__,x,y); \
  kmalloc(x,y);
#else
#define KMALLOC(x,y) \
  kmalloc(x,y);
#endif
I think the benefit of a macro here is quite visible... you cannot do this
with an inline.
You may also look at some better reasons:

[btw I found this by looking for 'macros vs inline' on google/linux]
