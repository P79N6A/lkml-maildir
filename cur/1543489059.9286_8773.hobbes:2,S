I believe console switching is done with interrupts disabled.  This is
a high-overhead operation (especially with a graphic console) with
obvious consequences.
However, something I don't seem to understand is why at least not
machines with a TSC are taught to handle missing ticks.  On non-TSC
machines this information is typically not available, but TSC machines
should be able to see missing ticks by examining the TSC.
