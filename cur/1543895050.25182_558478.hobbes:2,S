I ended up owning a piece of &*@( I rented from rent-a-center on a trip
because I wiped Windows and installed Debian.

I think you could be right. You (in 99% of all cases) agree to not
modify the machine anyway upon accepting it. Since you sign your rights
away at the minimum it would cost big time to enforce the license,
especially against a giant franchise.
That doesn't stop you from just letting people do what they want. If it
were me, I'd let people and that has nothing to do with the spirit of
the GPL, Windows is annoying and I wouldn't force someone to use it.
Probably, I'd just let them pick what they wanted and install it for
them.
I don't think they rent law degrees to go with computers however, you
have to get the blender or juicer to get that special.
Best,
