Hi,
	I have an application that uses an USB camera. This app is bit buggy and 
when it crashes (segmentation fault) it locks the devices so that the app 
always gets the message "Device or Resource Busy"(Thats error EBUSY). Note 
that app, mmaps device to memory.
        Now that app has crashed how do I release the device? rmmod on 
camera driver (or uhci) does not work.
Jatin
PS: Please cc me the response.
