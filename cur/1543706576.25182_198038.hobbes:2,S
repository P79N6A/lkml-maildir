No, it is adding an operation that previously was impossible to
make occur.

What I am proposing, is to keep pci_dma_sync_*() with it's current definition
which is to transfer control of the buffer from DEVICE to CPU.  It has always
been defined this way.
I am also adding a new operation, pci_dma_sync_device_*() which transfers control
of the buffer from CPU back to DEVICE.  This operation was not possible previously.
Therefore we will merge this into both 2.6.x and 2.4.x as soon as a suitable full
and reviewed patch exists.
If you flush the cache on ARM for pci_dma_sync_*(), so what?  If the cpu writes to
the buffer then asks the device to DMA from the area it's going to see garbage.
To be honest there aren't many pci_dma_sync_*() users, and thus it is relatively
easy to audit them all for problems in this area.  Yes, updates and clarifications
in the docs will be necessary as well.
