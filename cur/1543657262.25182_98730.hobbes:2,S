When I try 2.4.21-pre2 with your patch and the IEEE 1394 options you 
mention in your mail _nothing_ gets built inside the drivers/ieee1394 
directory and the error message at the final linking is:
<--  snip  -->
...
        -o vmlinux
ld: cannot open drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394.o: No such file or directory
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
How did you manage to get a kernel that actually compiles?
