It would be interesting to see that capture.
- The client is clearly finding the server (via NBT lookup or DNS
  lookup--doesn't matter, it's being found).
- The client is creating the TCP connection.
- The server (W9x) is closing the connection.  Why?
  + The most likely reason is 0x82: Called Name Not Present
That's my guess, anyway.  My bet is that W9x is being picky about the case
of the CALLED NAME.
It would not surprise me that the NBT name resolution code *does* convert
the case as part of the NBT encoding (that weird string that reads
EDEMDACACACACACACACACACACACACACA).  It would also not surprise me if the NBT
Session Request code *doesn't* convert the case.  The Session Request uses
the un-encoded string (in this case, "cl0").
The Windows 9x implementation of the NBT layer tends to be much more
"correct" than the NT family and its descendants.  As a result, W9x is
pickier about things like exact matches to the CALLED NAME.
That's all a guess, mind you, but it's something more to go on.
Again, the capture would hold the answer.
