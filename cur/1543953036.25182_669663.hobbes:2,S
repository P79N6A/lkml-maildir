I'm describing your use of it!  I'm sitting here trying to work out why on
earth this code is using the highly unusual (and highly suspicious) trylock
idiom and this is far from clear.
And I assume that if I can't work out why code is doing unusual-looking
things, then other readers will not be able to do so either.  Hence for
maintainability, that code of yours needs documenting.  I think.
Now it's true that I am unfamilar witht he arcanery of the maple driver and
the interfaces which it calls into.  But an experienced kernel developer
should be able to pick up a piece of code and have a decent shot at
understanding it.  And being able to review it...
