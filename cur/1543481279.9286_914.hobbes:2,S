(I'm not subscribed to the list, as my quota can't handle the load. :)
Please reply to me as well as to the list, if possible.)
I've just noticed a bug with having my scheduler set to 1000Hz (by editing
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/param.h, of course).  Although scheduling does,
in fact, seem smoother, ps returns that a process has been running longer
than it really has; in fact, it's by exactly a factor of 10, go figure.
Just to prove this, I ran the following simple script (PID 1097 is,
obviously, rc5des):
while (1)
	ps 1097 | tail -1
	sleep 1
end
I get results like this:
 1097  p0 R N517:34 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N517:44 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N517:54 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:04 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:14 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:24 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:34 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:44 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N518:54 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N519:04 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N519:14 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N519:24 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N519:34 ./rc5des 
 1097  p0 R N519:44 ./rc5des 
Now, just in case it matters (though I seriously doubt it), I *am* running
my system (a Celeron 300A) overclocked to 450.  Also, I'm still running
2.2.0-pre7, so if this bug has been fixed since then, my apologies;
however, I didn't see any mention of this in my quick perusal of the last
couple weeks' worth of the list archives at linuxhq.com.
This isn't really a fatal problem, but it is a bit annoying to have to
worry about, and it dosen't seem like the kind of thing that would take
long to fix.
