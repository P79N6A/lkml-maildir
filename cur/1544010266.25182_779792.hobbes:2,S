Sure, that's fine too.

Yeah, John and I discussed this before. What we really want it to move
the failing clocksource out of the list of available clocksources.
That type of change is pretty intrusive though, and I rather see it as
a separate topic.

Right. I guess most clocksource drivers for embedded platforms will
tie in the clock framework and use clk_enable() and clk_disable().
clk_enable() returns an int.

That's good! I hope we can sort out the details then!
