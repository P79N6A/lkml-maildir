Reading the gcc documentation (gcc-2.7.2 and egcs-1.1.2) I found:
<<`-fno-builtin'
<<     Don't recognize builtin functions that do not begin with two
<<     leading underscores.  Currently, the functions affected include
<<     `abort', `abs', `alloca', `cos', `exit', `fabs', `ffs', `labs',
<<     `memcmp', `memcpy', `sin', `sqrt', `strcmp', `strcpy', and
<<     `strlen'.
<<
<<     GCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin
<<     functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca' may
<<     become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and
<<     calls to `memcpy' may become inline copy loops.  The resulting
<<     code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function
<<     calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on
<<     those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by
<<     linking with a different library.
<<
<<     The `-ansi' option prevents `alloca' and `ffs' from being builtin
<<     functions, since these functions do not have an ANSI standard
<<     meaning. >>
And compiler make really this!
Also some of the optimized code in linux/include/asm*/string.h are never
used!
Possible work-around:
  1) use the option -fno-builtin in arch/*/Makefile
     
  2) use at top of include/asm*/string.h:
	#define strcmp linux_strcmp
	...
     This allows to mix the compiler/kernel optimized functions
I prefer the second work-around
Notes:
  1) We must carefully check if linux string functions work,
     before to make any change.
  2) The compiler handles the code better on constant arguments
  3) For each arch/processor we must choice the better code
  4) Extra notes:  
     - Remove include/asm-i386/string-486.h
     - Splits the file libs/string.c, so that linker can discard
       some functions.  
     - On libs/string.c:
	gcc allow to link 'void' files (void=without external/global
	symbols), also the "char * ___strtok = NULL;" can be moved
	within the "#ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_STRTOK" block.
