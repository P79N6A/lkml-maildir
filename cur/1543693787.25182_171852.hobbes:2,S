Just FYI: you can get at the useful bits of all of this without agreeing
to any license (which I haven't even seen; I don't have a Windows system
handy right now). I assumed the .img file was just a raw image of a floppy,
so a quick:
    mkdir /tmp/foo
    mount -o loop,ro easyRDP_v3_0.img /tmp/foo
does the trick for getting at the contents.
