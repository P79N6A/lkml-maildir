Tomasz,
I'm glad that 'acpi=force pci=noacpi' got your system up and running.
Andrew is right, needing acpi=force is intentional due to the age of the
system --
we're running away from aging broken BIOS's that vendors
refuse to update, and we need to draw the line someplace.
Some say that the 2001 should really be 2002...
But, needing pci=noacpi if you successfully ran with ACPI enabled before
would be a regression.
Thanks for sending the acpidmp output.
The DSDT shows Award's "VT86" PIRQ mapping code that we've been
struggling with recently.
Indeed, the lastest ACPI patch seems to help the modern descendents of
your machine.
But I don't see any obvious errors in the AML for the interrupt part on
your box.
Using IASL to re-build your disassembled DSDT showed some static errors
that will kill you if you hit them them at run time.  If you really want
to use ACPI for run-time features on this box you'd probably need to
modify your DSDT and over-ride it for starters.  There are a number of
web pages devoted to that hobby.
I'm more interested in the interrupt issue.  If you'd like to help us
debug it, then please file a bug at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
Category: power management, componenet: ACPI and attach your dmidecode
and acpidmp output.  The next piece to get would be the console messages
from the failing case -- you'd need a serial console to capture them.
Thanks,
-Len
