I complained very early on that it makes my workstation basically just
hang doing disk writes when I do big git tree operations on my sparc64
workstation.
Restoring the old values makes that go away.
It's an arbitrary number because the correct setting is dependant
upon what you're doing and how fast your disks are.
So I really think the "only benchmarks like the old settings"
argument doesn't really apply.
