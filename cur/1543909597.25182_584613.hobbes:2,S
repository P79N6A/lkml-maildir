    [x86 setup] Don't use EDD to get the MBR signature
    
    At least one machine has been identified in the field which advertises
    EDD for all drives but locks up if one attempts an extended read from
    a non-primary drive.
    
    The MBR is always at CHS 0-0-1, so there is no reason to use an
    extended read, other than the possibility that the BIOS cannot handle
    it.
    
    Although this might break as many machines as it fixes (a small number
    either way), the current state is a regression but the reverse is not.
    Therefore revert to the previous state of not using extended read.
    
    Quite probably the Right Thing to do is to read using plain (CHS) read
    and extended read on failure, but that change would definitely have to
    go through -mm first.

    [x86 setup] The current display page is returned in %bh, not %bl
    The current display page is an 8-bit number, even though struct
    screen_info gives it a 16-bit number.  The number is returned in %bh,
    so it needs to be >> 8 before storing.
    Special thanks to Jeff Chua for detailed bug reporting.
