Umm, that's enough of this thread ok?
Take it to gnu.misc.discuss or whipme.beatme.i.like.it
And this is a one time warning, open defiance and continuing this
thread will cost anyone their access to vger.  This kind of
"let's abuse people" threads cannot continue unchecked, and Andre
you are on terribly thin ice ok?
