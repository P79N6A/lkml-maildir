Hi,
     I have linux v2.2.15pre10 and the following problem is occuring
on a Dell optiplex GX1 333mhz intel platform.
      I've compiled both with and without the CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF 
option set in General Setup "Advanced Power Management BIOS Support" and
the problem is the same. When I run "halt" from root, the power on the
computer *is not* turned off. I must manually do it.
      This wasn't a problem in the linux 2.2.13 and linux 2.2.15pre7 kenels.
I have a linux 2.2.15pre9 which won't shut power off either, but then 
I don't recall if I selected the option. The option names changed
somewhere between 2.2.15pre7 and 2.2.15pre10.
