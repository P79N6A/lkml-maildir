IMO it's a bad idea.  In many cases we have ->permission() but it's
perfectly OK with being called under dcache_lock - either always or
in (fs-specific) "fast case".
I would prefer ->permission_light() that would always be called
under dcache_lock and besides the usual values could return -EAGAIN.
In that case ->permission() would be called in a normal way.
Corresponding permission_light(9) and permission(9) would be used
in obvious way.
vfs_permission() is just a default value of ->permission() - in effect
you are doing an equivalent of
	if (inode->i_op->permission == vfs_permission)
		/* we know it's OK to call under dcache_lock */
- just that we represent vfs_permission as NULL in i_op.  The reason
why it's Not Nice(tm) should be obvious...
