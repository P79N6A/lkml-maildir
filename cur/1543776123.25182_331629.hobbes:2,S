yes, that's the 10 second softlockup timeout.
does the patch below help? We initialized the timestamps to 0, but with 
jiffies starting out negative, that means a ~5 minutes gap until we 
first reach a value of 0. That would explain the messages. The only 
thing it doesnt explain, why did this only trigger on your box?
