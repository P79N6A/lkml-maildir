It's also available via an ioctl() and in sysfs. This allows you to
specify in an application that you want a device plugged into a specific
port of the machine. Not many applications can use it at the moment, but
udev can use it to assign a name of the device node.
"pinpad/input0" doesn't sound right. What port is your pinpad connected
to?
