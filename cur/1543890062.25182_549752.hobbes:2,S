 	  Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
 	  directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
 	  core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.
 
 	  These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
-	  information about USB interfaces must be available. One device contains
-	  the device node, the other device contains the interface data. Both
-	  devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one can't access
-	  the other. The device node created directly by the usbdev is the parent
-	  device of the interface and therefore easily accessible from the interface
-	  event.
