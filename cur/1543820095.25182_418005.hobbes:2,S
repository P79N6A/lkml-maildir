It was said that we need _incremental_ changes, and this is an attempt
to satisfy that request.

Indeed they aren't.

After the _first_ stage of the cleanups I propose, the export step will
still be necessary. You'll need to pick those headers which are intended
to be user-visible, and leave behind those which are not. 
If we actually go on to abolish __KERNEL__ and move the public headers
to a separate directory, you're right -- as I said, one day hopefully
it'll just be 'cp -a'. But that is not the _first_ stage. We need to do
this incrementally.

The stated plan is to start with a simple export mechanism which lets us
see the mess we have at the moment and work on the _real_ problem -- the
actual contents of the headers. Then to proceed towards the goal you
stated, which is what we wanted all along.
Who would be working in a different direction?
