Linus, could you apply the following bunch of fixes (split into separate
emails):
	* dentry leak upon the attempt of cross-device link().
	* recovery after get_block() failure in block_prepare_write()
	* ext2_update_inode() missing some cases when it should mark
	* bogus return values of truncate() and ftruncate().
fs as having large files
	* fix to ext2_get_block() - it should return -EFBIG if the block
number is too large, not -EIO.
All of these are real bugs and the first 3 are pretty bad.
The first one (not my catch) - sys_link() should do path_release() if
it decides to fail with -EXDEV. It doesn't. Result: exploitable dentry
leak. Please, apply.
