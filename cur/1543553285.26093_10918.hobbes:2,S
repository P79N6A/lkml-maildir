Subject: 2.2.18p18 eepro100 issues (packets per irq, shared irqs)

First of all I would like to say that 2.2.18p18 does not have the 'card 
reports no resources' messages when I saturate the 100mbit network anymore.
But I was wondering about two things:
I have a 815EE board, which has an onboard eepro100 and a pci eepro100.  
They share an irq, no matter if I'm using intels e100.o driver or the stock 
linux one.  For performance reasons, can I make them each have a different 
irq?  Doing it from ifconfig gives me a notsupported error, with either 
driver.
Also: VMSTAT output, comparing stock linux driver with intel.  Heres the 
stock linux:
1  0  0      0  31836  67632  13240   0   0     0     0 24015 47215  20  15  
65
1  0  0      0  31836  67632  13240   0   0     0     1 24016 47016  21  16  
64
The card is recv'ng 24k packets per second, and seeing that many irqs.  The 
intel driver does 6 per irq, and vmstat from that driver (not posted, but I 
remember what it was) shows 6 times less irq/sec and cs/sec.  Even though, 
it appears the stock linux driver is supposed to do 20 things per irq?  I am 
no kernel hacker...can I get the stock linux driver to do multiple packets 
per irq with some config settings?
Thanks,
Karl Pickett
