It's less work to add all this overhead back into my subsystem than to
argue about it's worthiness. It seemed obviously in-line with the
driver-model's purpose to have a remove callback, but maybe my way of
thinking is expecting too much from the driver core, and I should do the
work myself in the subsystem.
thanks
