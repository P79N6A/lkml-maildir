connect() in 2.2.10-ac11 (UP) for in-bound and out-bound TCP
connections occasionally yields EADDRNOTAVAIL for no appearent
reason. This seems to be fixed in 2.2.11-ac3 and 2.2.13.
Condition: a process is repeatedly creating and closing
connections. Interval is not less than 1 second. There are
about 600 connections because of this, mostly in TIME_WAIT.
Any confirmation that this bug is really gone?
or might it still be lurking somewhere in 2.2.13.
