So how did you generate the new .config?  Did you start with a defconfig
of some sort and then alter to personal taste?
I ask because if we have other users our there that have working system
with BLK_DEV_IDE=m it'd be nice to have make oldconfig fix them.  If
it's just a matter of not letting people get into that state then
something like the patch below will probably help.
Ensure that BLK_DEV_IDE is built-in befoer allowing BLK_DEV_IDE_PMAC to
be selected.
