That might be a problem with your toolchain.
Other mentions of that error message on Google
suggest that it's due to a kernel header problem.
I bet your toolchain uses kernel headers from 2.4.21 or earlier...
check includes/asm-ppc64/unistd.h to see if it's got the
line
   /* On powerpc a system call basically clobbers the same registers like a
in it.  If not, it may be missing the patch mentioned below.
