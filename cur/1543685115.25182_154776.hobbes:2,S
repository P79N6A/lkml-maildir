Thank you for your commentary which I agree with. With respect to these 
potential issues I have always worked on a fix for where I thought real world 
applications might cause these rather than try and fix it for just that program.
It was actually the opposite reason that my patch prevented thud from working; 
it is idle tasks that become suddenly cpu hogs that in the real world are 
potential starvers,  and I made a useful fix for that issue. Thud just happened 
to simulate those conditions and I only tested for it after I heard of thud. So 
just a (hopefully reassuring) reminder; I'm not making an xmms interactivity 
estimator, nor an X estimator, nor a "fix this exploit" one and so on.
