Anton,
You'd better go check this again.  On W2K partitions, there's a reserved
area for the volume manager stuff.  Your earlier version did step on
this info.  Also, the volume information attribute is probably where we
are getting into trouble since the current driver does not appear to be
setting the UPGRADE_ON_MOUNT bits after you modify a W2K NTFS volume. 
You probably need to experiment with these bits to see if W2K can mount
the volumes after you've written them.
