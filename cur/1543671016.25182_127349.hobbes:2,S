Good points.

I don't quite see how this would make user space any less
fancy:
# insmod audio_driver volume=`retrieve_volume`
versus
# insmod audio_driver
# aumix -L >/dev/null
only that the latter can do a lot more, so you may want it even
if the module lets you set the volume. And the module solution
doesn't help with monolithic kernels. (And I doubt you'd want
this to be a kernel command line parameter. Talk about fancy.)

echo 'aumix -L >/dev/null' >>/etc/rc.d/rc.local
Wow, that was hard :-) (Okay, things get a tad more complex if
you have more than one mixer.)
