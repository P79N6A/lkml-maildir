Hello,
After compiling files "ttime.c" and "ttime.h", I try to load them into
the kernel using the command /sbin/insmod ttime.o. However, the
following message suggests that a version conflict  has prevented the
loading to be performed correctly:
"kernel-module version mismatch. ttime.o was compiled for kernel
2.4.0-0.26 while this kernel is version 2.2.16-22".
My question is: since the source has been compiled on the same kernel as
it is going to be loaded into, how come this message ? What do I have to
do in order to avoid such problem ? Change the source code ? Where did
it learn about 2.4.0-0.26 if I am using 2.2.16-22 (Red Hat 7.0) ?
Thanks in advance,
Marcus.
