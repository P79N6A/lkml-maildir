Thanks for the fix. :-)
Now, (using the fact that Pavel already is in the CC list ;-)) there's another
issue I have with swsusp, which is broken in a funny way.  Namely, after
resuming from disk the box immediately goes into standby from which it
can be woken up by pressing the power button, but then it oopses,
goes into standby (or something similar) again, and hangs solid (unfortunately
I can't get the traces right now).
Greetings,
Rafael
