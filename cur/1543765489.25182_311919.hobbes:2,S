If I understand swsusp correctly, we can simply set a bit in the pbe
struct to indicate that it's a locked page. 
This can be done by walking the vma list attached to the page's
address space with vma_prio_tree_foreach() and checking the
vma->vm_flags with VM_LOCKED. Analogous to what the swapout code does.
We can either do this in data_write() or preferably higher
(copy_data?) when we have the pfn handy. The lock bit can be stashed
in bit 0 of pbe->address, among other places. Then in data_read, we
check the bit and zero the source.
As I'm not about to actually use swsusp any time soon, someone else is
invited to implement the above. Should take about 10-20 lines.
