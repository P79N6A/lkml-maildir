The thing is, I think even my version is wrong.
Why? Because this whole case _should_ have been handled by mprotect 
already.
The way we handle VM_WRITE getting set in mprotect() etc is not by 
checking that the file is writable, but checking that VM_MAYWRITE is set.
And that's what we did with VM_EXEC too.
So I think that the _real_ bug is that VM_MAYEXEC is set, even though it 
clearly should not be.
In other words, I think the _real_ fix is actually to do this at mmap() 
time, something like the following..
This is equally untested as the previous version, but I think this is 
really conceptually the Right Thing(tm).
