Subject: CPU detection broken in 2.5.27?

Hi all,
I just noticed that my /proc/cpuinfo states wrong or incomplete 
information about my processor. My PIII-1000M Processor is reported as 
00/0B (Stepping?) and with only 32 KB of cache (which obviously is the 
L1d and L1i value). I think this happened during the split of the CPU 
detection code... I found nothing about that in archives or similar 
(i.e. on the list).
Perhaps someone who knows how to do it can look into that as i would 
need hours just to understand just what they are doing there and to read 
the specs of the CPUID instruction etc
Thanks in advance
Markus
