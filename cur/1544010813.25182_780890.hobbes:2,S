Hi Bart,
here's a first attempt at removing all references to ide_atapi_pc in the ATAPI
IRQ handler. I've moved some of the members to the drive struct and will deal
with them later :). The next step is to add an ide_atapi_queue_pc() routine
similar to ide_cd_queue_pc() and then rewrite all functions in the drivers to
use struct requests and local buffers instead of pc->buf and then, after that
works reliably, finally get rid of ide_atapi_pc completely.
This has been tested with ide-floppy.
