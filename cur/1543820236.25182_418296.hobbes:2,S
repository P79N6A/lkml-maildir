SELinux kernel support can _almost_ do what AA does; with notable
exception of labels for new files. That can probably be fixed with
patch of reasonable size (or maybe even with LD_PRELOAD library, glibc
modification, or stuff like that). (There was post showing that in
this long flamewar).
That way you can have SELinux that works on AA config files.
(I still dislike path-based security, but labeling patch can probably
be useful for other stuff, too.)
