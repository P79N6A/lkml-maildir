I stand with Shem on this one.  The people behind the SBS specification
seems to agree... that specification is aimed at *engineers* and still
avoids the obvious trap of using "charge" due to its high potential for
confusion.
I don't even want to know how much of a mess the people writing applets
woudl make of it...

The way things are going, it should be feasible for small embedded systems
quite soon.  Refer to the previous thread.
