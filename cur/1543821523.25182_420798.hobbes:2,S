Was it you who removed the copyrights from the "usbnet" driver and
changed the author assertion to one "M Subrahmanya Srihdar" ??
I'm guessing the latter; the www.moschip.com site implies that
its engineering HW is in India.
Either way, blatant plagiarism and theft of copyright is unlikely
to get into upstream kernels.
Likewise, that is NOT the way to integrate with the "usbnet" driver
framework.  See how it's done by the "asix.c" driver module.
In fact, I'm very tempted to ask them to withdraw their distribution,
since they have clearly violated pretty basic terms of the GPL.  How
long have they been doing that?  How much money have they made by
this theft?
That stuff is correctible ... but until they correct their problems,
I'm not inclined to let them continue distributing stolen software.
