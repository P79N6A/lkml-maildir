It seems to have added one more complexity that isn't standard on other
systems, however. So now when users manually upgrade their kernel, and things
break, we will have to ask them, "are you using that redhat > 6.1? did you
upgrade your kernel headers in /usr/include/{linux,scsi,asm}?"
Not everyone wants to have to upgrade their headers, especially for a quick
two line patch that fixes the problem well before RedHat releases a new
kernel version that does the same thing. Sounds like extra support on RedHat's,
but it eventually filters down to the public forums.
