(Not tested but something like this ought to split them neatly out of
 a master tree into the 2.4 format)
for i in $(find . -name "[Cc]onfig.in" -print)
do
	grep CONFIG_ '$i'
done | sort -u |
while read x
do
	grep -B1 -A200 '$x' MasterConfigHelpFile |
	( 
		read A
		read B
		cat > frob
	)
	ed frob << 'FOO'
	/^$
	.,$d
	wq
	'FOO' >/dev/null
	cat frob
done
