Still not cheap enough to throw away, unless you are Boeing.

It is slower, because of the extra overhead you have imposed on every
memory allocation. And it is no more reliable, except in OOM
situations - which your draconian resource quotas make MUCH more
frequent for the users.

Point to a system which has never passed 50% of VM in use, and your
request will be laughed out of purchasing.

Overcommit does not cause system crashes; nor is it related in any way
to user resource quotas.

You should be, if you do so by disabling legitimate use of the system.

If users are unable to perform legitimate tasks due to a "lack of
resources", when the machine has ample resources to spare, I would
consider the system down. I would then fire the sysadmin who
configured it that inefficiently.
However, if you REALLY insist on setting the system up so people can
login and display all sorts of nice OOM error messages on an idle
system, go ahead. I'm not stopping you.

No, the system never gets as far as crashing, because the inept
sysadmin has already disabled it.

Except people continually retrying operations which are failing due to
a non-existent lack of resources.

The customers have already gone somewhere they can actually run
software without OOM errors.

So what? 0 Gb of swap is still cheaper.
