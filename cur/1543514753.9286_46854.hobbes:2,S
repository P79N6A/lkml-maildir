    "hda: FUJITSU MPB3032ATU, 3093MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=785/128/63, UDMA"
    my kernel says at boot time.
    I have the same problem since years (in 2.0.xx too), but I blindly trust
    in Linux (the salesman didn't told me that the disk had some cache and he
    told my that it was UDMA), so I thought that I got a bad hard disk drive
    (it was really cheap, maybe too much cheap and anyway it works).
    But it seems to me that your reply maybe it's a bit too much "political":
Political?
The kernel sends an identify drive command, the drive reports, and the kernel
prints what the drive reports. In this particular case this field is zero.
No politics involved.
