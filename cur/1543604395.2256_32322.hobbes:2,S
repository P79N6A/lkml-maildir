Following the last USB changes, the uhci modules emits a lot of
messages:
kernel: usb: raced timeout, pipe 0x80000180 status 0 time left 0
kernel: usb: raced timeout, pipe 0x80000100 status 0 time left 0
approx 50 on one box, and around 20 on another.
This message does not occur with the usb-uhci module.
Someone disconcerting. Systems still talk to the camera ...
