glibc 2.1.x has minimal support for 64bit file size handling. You probably
need to build 64bit aware tools. You might also be hitting a device bug that
seems to be in Linus kernel where devices are inheriting the file size limit
of the underlying fs the /dev node is on. However I thought that was long
fixed.
