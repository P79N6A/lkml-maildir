What he said was,
"After 2.6.9-ac its clear that the long 2.6.9 process worked very badly. 
While 2.6.10 is looking much better its long period meant the allegedly 
"official" base kernel was a complete pile of insecure donkey turd for 
months. That doesn't hurt most vendor users but it does hurt those 
trying to do stuff on the base kernels very badly."
