To elaborate, for most LFS implementations:
  Block offsets are 32 bits.
  The block size is 2^10 or 2^12.
  Thus total file size is limited to 2^42 or 2^44.

The LFS kernel patches for 2.2 change the file offset to 64 bits, and add
new syscalls to the kernels with 64 bit offsets.
The LFS patches I've seen (including Scyld's) don't change the block index,
which is still a 32 bit value.  Changing the block index to 64 bits would be
a much bigger change.  While many people will soon need 5GB files, very few
people need a over 1TB file.
The kernel was a small fraction of the LFS work.  More effort went into
library changes, and the bulk of the time was spent testing (and
occasionally fixing) utilities and applications.  I know that people on this
mailing list focus on kernel issues, just keep in mind that adding LFS is a
whole-system issue.

We provide a distribution with LFS and commercial support.  It includes a
kernel with LFS and 'bproc' (Beowulf cluster process management) support,
libraries with LFS support, and utilities modified and tested with both
sparse and dense large files on ext2.
It's not a low-cost, mass-market distribution that can be bought at the
corner computer store, but it is available.

Part of the LFS enhancement is FTP client, FTP server, and 'scp' modication.
As you stated, NFS version 2 and Samba will not work with e.g. 5GB file, and
we don't yet support NFS version 3.
