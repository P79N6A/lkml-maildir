Using kernel 2.4.0-test10...
It seems to detect the controller card and the drives, but
they are not assigned to any devices after boot up.
I know that the RAID won't work, but I guess I thought 
it would setup the 2 drives I have connected.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,

Here is some info:

          This line is interesting I thought...
