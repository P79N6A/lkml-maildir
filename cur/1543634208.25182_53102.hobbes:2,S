are you sure we want one generic, process-based affinity interface?
i think the affinity to certain memory regions might need to be more
finegrained than this. Eg. it could be useful to define a per-file
(per-inode) 'backing store memory node' that the file is affine to. This
will eg. cause the pagecache to be allocated in the memory node.
Process-based affinity does not describe this in a natural way. Another
example, memory maps: we might want to have a certain memory map (vma)  
allocated in a given memory node, independently of where the process that
is faulting a given pages resides.
and it might certainly make sense to have some sort of 'default memory
affinity' for a process as well, but this should be a different syscall -
it really does a much different thing than CPU affinity. The CPU resource
is 'used' only temporarily with little footprint, while memory usage is
often for a very long timespan, and the affinity strategies differ
greatly. Also, memory as a resource is much more complex than CPU, eg. it
must handle things like over-allocation, fallback to 'nearby' nodes if a
node is full, etc.
so i'd suggest to actually create a good memory-affinity syscall interface
instead of trying to generalize it into the simple, robust, finite
CPU-affinity syscalls.
