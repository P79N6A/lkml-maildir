FYI:
I suspect that: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104619727013220&w=2
is related to my problem.
Anyhow, I'm using a UDMA5 WesternDigital drive on a ASUS 
K7M266-D motherboard.  With a plain, stock 2.4.20 kernel, 
the viper driver properly recognizes which channel has the 
80 wire cable (in my case ide0).  The hard disk is the 
primary master, a cd-r drive is the primary slave, and a zip 
drive is the secondary slave.  I can successfully set UDMA5 
with hdparm without any problems.  However, after upgrading 
to 2.4.21-pre4-ac7, I noticed that the drive was stuck at 
UDMA2.  Checking /proc/ide/amd74XX yeilds some unexpected 
results:

It appears that the driver has got it backwards, identifying 
my 80 wire cable as a 40 wire cable and visa-versa.  As I 
mentioned, this is completely opposite to the behavior of 
2.4.20.  I've poked around the source, but I can't come up 
with anything new to what the other person discovered. 
Trying to pass ide0=ata66 doesn't seem to have any effect on 
the situation.  I can provide further information upon 
request, but I don't think it will be necessary at this point.
Cheers,
Nicholas
