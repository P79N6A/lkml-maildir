Looks like you are running out of memory.  You will need more memory
to be able to hold all the receive rings data, as well as data in flight.
Rough estimate:
	R8169 := 4 * 256 (ringsize) * 2K  
	Tulip := 4 * 128  * 2K
That comes out to 3 Meg in use just being idle. Once you get going
it could easily be 3x that.
And that is for standard 1500 byte MTU. If you use large packets, you
will have problems with memory fragmentation and will probably have
to go to a bigger 64 bit machine and even more memory.
