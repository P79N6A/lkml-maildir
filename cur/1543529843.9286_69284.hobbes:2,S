No. That's the requirement if they all "dirty" every single page of their
own image. Shall we try including the RAM required to lock all the
mmap()ed pages into physical RAM at once, too? How about requiring
physical RAM to be bigger than physical RAM + swap space + filesystems?
Besides, this is all wrong anyway - see below.

No. Those theoretical conditions you speak of would require Apache and
mod_perl to be self-modifying code on an appalling scale.

Since neither is really a possibility, though, this is just silly.
If you REALLY want to allow for the worst case: Each process has an
address space of 3 Gb (+1Gb kernel). Your method would require, for a
sytem with a hard limit of 1024 processes, a minimum of 3Tb swap+RAM. You
can try this if you want, but I don't think many people will follow this.
