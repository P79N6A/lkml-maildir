The 
http://www.hardrock.org/HT-results/
 output is with and without
hyper threading.
The balancing patch was applied to both sets of tests.  
The system is now in production, therefore I can't do the same tests on it
without the routing patches (note there are 2, one for
everything but the timer, and one for the timer).
We will be receiving several new Dell systems (1650, 2650, and
6650 models) and I know that at least the 2650 and 6650 are P4
with the server works GC chipset, so I may be able to run some tests
on those, given I have the time to do it.
