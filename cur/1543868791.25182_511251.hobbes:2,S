-mm's have been failing since some time after .19-rc6-mm1. I believe
I've tried 2.6.19-mm? with the same luck

I didn't mention 2.6.20-mm1 and got to see -mm2 so it is the one which
Iv'e tried, but, once again, I experienced the same issue with 19-mm?
kernels.
I built 2.6.20-mm2 without backlight support
$> grep BACKLIGH /boot/config-2.6.20-mm2 
# CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_BACKLIGHT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_RIVA_BACKLIGHT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT is not set
that "eliminated" the problem. Also I can see the screen with pure
2.6.20 with backlight support (whatever it does since after
loading lcd, backlight modules, my /sys/class/{lcd,backlight} are empty):
*$> grep BACKLIGH /boot/config-2.6.20 
# CONFIG_FB_BACKLIGHT is not set
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT=y
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=m
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_DEVICE=y
> Also, do you normally see files under /sys/class/lcd?
nope... after I load lcd module, no files under :-/ regardless either it
is mm or not. But there are files under /sys/class/backlight/ for mm2
compiled with backlight support (whenever the screen is dark as per my
original email)
