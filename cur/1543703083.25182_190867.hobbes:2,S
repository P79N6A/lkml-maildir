I have strange notebook here, and that one only works reasonably with
APM (with ACPI: no network IRQs, random mouse problems, random
shutdowns due to bad temperature readings).
I'd suggest to leave old driver there (possibly let me clean it up
;-)))), and create new powernow-k8-acpi, or powernow-acpi or something
like that.
