I did nobh option only for writeback mode + only if PAGE_SIZE == 
blocksize case :(
I guess I could enhance it for PAGE_SIZE > blocksize case also.
Doing it for ordered mode, journal mode is hard - due to transactions & 
ordering.
As you suggested while ago, we need a new mode. I hate to add new modes 
since
no one will be using it (unless we decide to make it default). Thats the 
reason why
I spent little time doing nobh option for writeback mode.

Can be added easily. I will send out a patch for this.
