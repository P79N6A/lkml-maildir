	Just to add a datapoint to the discussion, I'm using a VIA
	chipset here (in fact, it's an Asus A7V board with a Duron), a
	2.2.18 kernel with André's patches and I'm only using IDE
	(UDMA/66 and UDMA/33 here) and I'm *not* seeing any problems.
	Perhaps this may be a problem with some revisions of the
	chipset (or, perhaps, I'm not stressing my system enough for
	the bugs to show their heads).
	I'm attaching the output of lspci of my machine to this
	message.
	I also used a 2.4.0 kernel with all support for everything
	here enabled, but the HD where I had that kernel died. :-( So,
	I'm back using a 2.2.0 kernel.

	This may be a possibility, since I'm using this very same
	chipset and I'm not seeing any problems...

	I'm using these (but I don't have anything in my Promise
	controller yet, since I couldn't find UDMA/100 drives when I
	bought my machine).

	But I'm not using SMP nor SCSI here.
	Hope this helps, Roger...
