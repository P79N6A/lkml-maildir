===8<=== Large list of kernel tarballs cut ===>8===
Unfortunately, they're all ones I've already found...
If you can help with any of the following, which are still missing, it
would be very much appreciated...
	0.02
	0.03
	0.95a.1
	0.95a.2
	0.96a.1
	0.96a.2		*
	0.96a.3		*
	0.96a.4		*
	0.99.13a
	0.99.13b
	0.99.13c
	0.99.13d
	0.99.13e
	0.99.13f
	0.99.13g
	0.99.13h
	0.99.13i
	0.99.13j
	0.99.13l
	0.99.13m
	0.99.13n
	0.99.13o
	0.99.13p
	0.99.13q
	0.99.13r
	0.99.13s
	0.99.13t
The three marked with an asterisk are ones I have patch files for.
Unfortunately, I need either the patch file of kernel tarball for
0.96a.1 before I can make use of those patch files...
Best wishes from Riley.
