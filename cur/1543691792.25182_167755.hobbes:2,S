If multiple threads do reads to the same socket, one using
MSG_PEEK and one without, there is a race because the thread
doing MSG_PEEK doesn't expect the bytes it is "peeking" at
to be removed from the receive queue from the socket, but that
is exactly what the other thread will do.
When using URG data, the kernel becomes the "other thread doing
non-MSG_PEEK reads" on the socket.  So if you use MSG_PEEK and
URG data at the same time, you will likely trigger the race and
that printk() alerting you to this fact.
