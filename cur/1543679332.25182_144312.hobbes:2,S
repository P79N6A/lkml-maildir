Well, I guess it's cross binutils? What about native binutils
installed on alpha? The package shipped with suse 8.1
(binutils-2.12.90.0.15-27) doesn't work for 2.5 kernels.

Code generated by gcc-2.95 is obviously bogus. Which is not surprising -
2.95 is known to be broken for 32-bit host -> 64-bit target
cross-compilation. Try something more recent. ;-)
