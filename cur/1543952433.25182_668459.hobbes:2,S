It is in 2.6.25-rc4 and later.  ;-)

S390's memory model is quite strong, so it might not be needed.  In any
case, if needed, it goes -before- the cpu_set(), because the problems
would arise if prior RCU read-side critical sections were to be reordered
to follow this cpu_set(), right?
Let's see...  In S390, a store cannot be reordered to precede any prior
load or store, so any preceding RCU read-side critical section would be
seen by all CPUs as preceding the shift to nohz mode.  Might be trouble
for the opposite transition...
But last I heard, the s390 guys were thinking in terms of moving to the
generic dynticks model.  If they really are doing so, then the above
code goes away in any case.
