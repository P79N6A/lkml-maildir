The "regression" was your original problem, no sound on rc7, which was
fixed by reverting the patch.  Now I'd like to know that my new patch
doesn't break after reverting the broken patch.
In short, try my patch on the latest Linus git tree.  Check whether
the sound still works.

Yeah, I know that it doesn't fix the rc7.

Hm.  Looks like the problem appearing only with IDT STAC codecs.
The symptom indicates that it's not about the EAPD for the speaker but
in the deeper core initialization part...

It's simply a delay.  Basically Ingo's patch changed msleep() to
udelay() to reduce *unneeded* delays.  The function waits until the
all pending commands are processed.  The delay is simply to reduce the
system load.  And, now, changing this delay causes a problem
surprisingly.

No.  You'd better to clone Linus git tree, then pull from alsa.git mm
branch.
  % git-clone $LINUS/linux-2.6.git
  % cd linux-2.6
  % git-pull $ALSA/alsa.git mm
