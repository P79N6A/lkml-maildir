e2fsck froze up (waited 10 minutes before rebooting) after checking
70.0% of a 63Gb scsi partition (41Gb used) under 2.4.0test9.
This was repeatable.
fsck'd fine when booting from 2.2.17pre19.
Both kernels are PIII SMP, compiled with up-to-date Debian stable,
machine has 1Gb Ram, Adaptec AIC-7860.
The fsck was during bootup; the partition was the /var/home, and not
mounted at the time.
It's a heavily-used server, so I can't experiment much on it, but if
anyone wants me to try something, I could conceivably do so one evening.
