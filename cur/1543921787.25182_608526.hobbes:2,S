I don't think this data corruption problem w/ sil3114 is related to
m15w.  m15w workaround slows down things quite a bit and is likely to
hide problems on PCI bus side.  There are reports of data corruption
with 3114 on nvidia (most common), via and now amd chipsets.  There's
one on intel too but IIRC wasn't too definite.
According to a user, freebsd didn't have data corruption problem on the
same hardware.  I copied PCI FIFO setup code (ours is broken BTW) but it
didn't fix the problem.
I'll try to reproduce the problem locally and hunt it down.
Thanks.
