"LCD display" is wrong and, excuse me, dumb in *all* languages. The fact
that it is common doesn't make it a smart thing to say or write. :-)
If you find "LCD" or "LC display" ugly to look at or hard to understand
(IMO it is not hard to understand if it appears in a computer technology
related context), you could write "liquid crystal display". I suppose
you could also just write "cfag12864b display".
I am not sure which looks prettiest. But I know that "LCD display" looks
really bad to everybody who knows what the D stands for. :-)
