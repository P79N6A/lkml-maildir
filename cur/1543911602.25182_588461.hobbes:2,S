That should be changed, yes. But we should not reach the end of the
buffer.

Because nobody added these checks, most of the callers check, some
don't. We should fix that step by step, sure.

Yeah, before these changes it was the environment buffer which got
corrupted, but seems nobody noticed it. Now it triggers BUG() if we run
into problems.
This needs a fix. It may be the reason for the too small buffer, you are
