I prefer the former, which is how it's already implemented in CML1.
But the discussion of this is entirely unrelated to the discussion of CML2, 
and changes along these lines must not be forced into the kernel with the 
CML2 patch.
If ESR is going to sneak policy changes into the kernel with the CML2 
mechanism patch, I'm sure we all have patches we'd like him to add to it 
too, because we don't want to have to justify them on their own. :)
