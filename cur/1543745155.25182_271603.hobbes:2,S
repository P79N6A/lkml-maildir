I would like to request that the realtime LSM be included in the next
-mm release.
Here is the current patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/diff/2004/11/9/288/1
Here is Jack's announcement:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/9/288
No objections were raised to the patch in its current form.
This applies cleanly against 2.6.10-rc2-mm1.  The short version of what
it does is "enables selected non-root users to run RT apps (ie use
SCHED_FIFO and mlock)".
