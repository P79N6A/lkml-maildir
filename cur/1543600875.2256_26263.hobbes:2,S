I've just gotten 3 of these while building gcc (UP ev67):
  kernel BUG at /home/rth/work/linux/linux/include/linux/file.h:93!
  sh(19121): Kernel Bug 1
  [Oops report]
  Call trace:
	fffffc000085421c	do_pipe+2ac
	fffffc000081313c	sys_pipe
Given that we've called get_unused_fd, it seems highly suspect
that we'd have a descriptor installed already.  
Is anyone else seeing this, or should I start looking for compiler bugs?
