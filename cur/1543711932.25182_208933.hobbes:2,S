This subtlety in try_to_unmap_nonlinear_pte:
	page_map_lock(page);
	/* check that we're not in between set_pte and page_add_rmap */
	if (page_mapped(page)) {
		unmap_pte_page(page, vma, address + offset, ptep);
Harmless, but isn't our acquisition of the page_table_lock guaranteeing
that it cannot be in between set_pte and page_add_rmap?
