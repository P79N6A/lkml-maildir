Not really.  The whole point is to have the adapter DMA the data directly from memory to 
the network.  That's why it's called RDMA - remote DMA.

Yes, and if it turns out that the same MPI application dies on Linux but not on Solaris 
because Linux doesn't really care if the memory stays pinned, then we're going to see a 
lot of MPI customers transitioning away from Linux.

True, but I'm not going to waste my time adding this support if the consensus I get from 
the kernel developers that they don't want Linux to behave this way.

A little more nasty.  I raise RLIMIT_MEMLOCK in the driver to "unlimited" and also set 
cap_raise(IPC_LOCK).  I do this because I need to support all 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions 
with the same driver, but only 2.6.10 and later have any support for non-root mlock().
If and when our driver is submitted to the official kernel, that nastiness will be removed 
of course.
