Yes, of course. I was just saying that when the filesystem is in an operation,
	`df` -> sys_statvfs() -> [fuse magic] -> my_fuse_fs_statfs()
I cannot cancel that operation in a way such that df (or /proc/mounts if you
like) does not show the mount anymore when the peer is dead. I have to return
something. I am fine with that.

poll() alone seems to do just what I want, thank you very much.
When the socket breaks, poll raises POLLIN, POLLHUP and POLLRDHUP, but not
POLLERR. What exactly is the difference between HUP and RDHUP? The manpage is
not too verbose on that. (A guess would be that RDHUP is only for sockets,
not pipes.)
thanks,
