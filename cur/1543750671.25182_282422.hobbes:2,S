The presumption is that these changes are frivolous. This is false.
The removals of these features are motivated by their unsoundness,
and those removals resolve real problems. If they did not do so, they
would not pass peer review.

I can't speak for anyone during the times of more ancient Linux history;
however, developers' dissatisfaction with the development model has been
aired numerous times in certain fora. It has not satisfactorily served
developers or users. Users are locked into distro kernels for
incompatible extensions, and developers are torn between multiple
codebases.
This fragmentation of programmer effort is trivially recognizable as
counterproductive. A single focal point for programmer effort is far
superior for a development model. If the standard of stability is not
passed then the code is not ready to be included in any kernel. Then
the distinction is lost, and each of the fragmented codebases gets a
third-class effort, and a spurious expenditure of effort is wasted on
porting fixes and features across numerous different codebases.
Your estimate of the impact of the feature set upon applications is
also somewhat exaggerated. The system call ABI has remained backward
compatible for extended periods of time covering major releases. In
fact, it would be my personal preference for the next major release to
signify nothing more than a system call ABI change involving the purging
of several older, deprecated system call conventions.
