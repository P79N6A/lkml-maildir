i'm sorry, i'm not sure what you're getting at here.  all this patch
does is allow memparse to accept a NULL second argument if the caller
has no interest in what is normally passed back in that argument.
and there are certainly *numerous* places in the source where callers
are passing a bogus second argument just because they have to pass
*something*.
allowing NULL as a second arg just makes it more visually obvious that
the caller isn't interested in that return value.  or is there
something more subtle going on here that i'm not understanding?
