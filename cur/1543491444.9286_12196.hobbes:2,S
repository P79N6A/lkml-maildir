How do you define "a Linux-based version of the GNU operating system."?
Correct me if I'm wrong here:
Linux is a POSiX compliant (or nearly so) OS written in C and built
using GNU tools.  It is not "the" GNU OS, now or ever.
"The GNU operating system" is the as-yet incomplete HURD, which had
little or no connection to Linux.
If the above are correct, I missed the point.  Forgive my newness here -
I have only been involved in Linux for a very short time, with GNU tools
only a little longer.
Please reply to the list - I'm on it and need no extra copies of the
replies.  Thanks.begin:vcard
