I'm trying to upgrade an old AMD K6-2 machine (aladdin bios/gigabyte GA-5AX
motherboard, latest version of the bios) to 2.6.11. Unfortunately kernels later 
than 2.6.9 hang very early in the boot process just after the vga= mode selection, 
but before the kernel announces "uncompressing linux".
I have narrowed the problem down to the store_edid function in
arch/i386/boot/video.S where the edid block is obtained and stored before
entering protected mode.  The exact patch which seems to cause me problems
is 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.3/1786.html
Storing the edid block at 0x140 causes this machine to hang, whereas backing
this patch out and instead using 0x440 (or even 0x160) seems to work fine.
Is this problem just because of an old and buggy bios or is there another
reason?
Thanks for your help
