Promise are clearly being less than helpful here and that is not your fault.
However as far as I can see everyone who has a FastTrak which is "stuck"
in RAID mode[1] would be happy if it worked as a normal IDE controller
in Linux, which is (usually?) not the case - eg on the MSI board where
only the first channel is seen.
[1] generally because it is integrated with the motherboard and RAID
is the only thing that the BIOS understands
