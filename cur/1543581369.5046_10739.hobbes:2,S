Your unlikely to get 1 MB of contigous ram unless you grab it very early 
in the boot process.  This means your driver needs to be built into the 
kernel, it can't be a module.

No.

If we had reverse page tables we could perhaps do this sort of 
remapping.  Currently there is no way to detrimine which physical page 
maps to which userland page without scanning every processes page 
tables.  There is also the possibility that the memory is used by the 
kernel, in which case your basically out of luck.
