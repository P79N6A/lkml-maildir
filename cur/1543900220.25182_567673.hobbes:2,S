Suspend failing due to ordering requirements from fuse, I think you
documented this one.
Suspend failing due to malicious/buggy fuse filesystem.
Suspend failing if network filesystem is mounted, and network or
server is down.  This is one of those "we can live with it" things
that only happen rarely, and it's annoying then, but soon forgotten.
Freezing of tasks is slowing down suspend.  Don't know how serious
this is, suspend is pretty fast, but could possibly be even faster.
Don't know what the OLPC guys do to make suspending extremely quick,
are they freezing any tasks?

OK, if you elimitate all of the above problems with the freezer, I'll
say no more against it.
