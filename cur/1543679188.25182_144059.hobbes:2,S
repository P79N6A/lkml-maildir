Custom devices certainly have done that, with drivers that keep
everything busy.  Last fall, one person reported 38+ MB/sec
from a VT8235.  The theoretical peak bandwidth for bulk traffic
(what most folk want) is 52 MByte/sec.
A Western Digital drive I tried gave me 27 MByte/sec with USB.
And I hate to say that the FireWire mode didn't work at all,
since I was curious how they'd compare!  (2.5.71 or so.)

Some combinations of EHCI silicon, USB-to-IDE adapter, and IDE
work better than others ... I once switched a drive from one
EHCI controller to another (same host and OS, didn't reboot),
and went from 5 MB/s to 19 MB/sec.  That was on 2.4; with the
2.5 usb-storage, both controllers gave the higher speed.

The key difference in 2.5 is that usb-storage queues requests,
no more slow page-at-a-time I/O.  It's the same EHCI driver
underneath, lately -- much improved since last September (or so)
when it first started to generate real user feedback.
