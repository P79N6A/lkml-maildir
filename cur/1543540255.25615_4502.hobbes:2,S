Whatever support there now is, i've been able to do this without
that stuff so far.
Just mounting /tmp/disk.img4 doesnt' work: you have to setup
the loopdev yourself.
I do:
losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop0 /tmp/disk.img 
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/d1
to mount the first partition on a full-disk image that has been
formatted with Microsoft tools. (I'm afraid you'll have to parse the
partition table and do the math to find the offset in bytes yourself.)
