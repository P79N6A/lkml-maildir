The only way to actually know if it really makes a difference or not
would be to run a double-blind test, with people not knowing if
they're running a RT kernel or not, and then reporting their
experience re. desktop smoothness. But I doubt such a test could
actually be taken into consideration, unless distributions start
shipping with different kernels without the user knowing, and then ask
about how it feels ...
This all being said, esp. concerning the next point you rise

IIRC, there have been (I'm not sure if there still are) some issues
with IRQs being lost on the input devices, missing keys, missing
events or misbehaving of mice and similar ... would these problems
(and the underlying issues in the codepaths) be more easy or harder to
happen and to trace if they happened?
