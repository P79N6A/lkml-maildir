I dont think its a question of editing "THEM" but more a question of editing
/etc/sysconfig/network
I belive its that file which sets /etc/HOSTNAME at boot time
As a tempory measure, you can use 'hostname' to change the hostname of your
machine without rebooting.
BTW;
A Linux machine should really never be rebooted, its only windows that
needs rebooting, as the old saying goes.
Windows has detected that you have moved your mouse, please reboot for the
changes to take effect.
