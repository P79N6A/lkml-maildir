I did not suggest the change-variable-type-from-unsigned-to-signed
thing as a "general" solution to such cases! ... in fact what I said
was that such cases do _not_ have a general solution at all, and
that shutting gcc up might not be a good idea, because a lot of
times such warnings do un-hide bugs. [ BTW when I gave the
change-type-from-unsigned-to-signed example, I had the size_t vs
ssize_t typo/bug in mind, for which changing the type is the proper
fix; and note that similar bugs can occur for non-size_t cases too. ]

Hmmm, but I tend to agree with the sentiment expressed in:
