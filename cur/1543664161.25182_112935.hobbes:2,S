I've reports of people with rev6's who have reported success
with that workaround commented out.  Could be they never
pushed the machine hard enough to trigger a bug, but I'd
have thought this breakage would show up pretty quickly.
My attempts to contact serverworks in the past have fallen on
deaf ears. maybe you have better luck ?
