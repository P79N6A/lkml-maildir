Again another good Idea. Your right;-) Its better. 
But it better getting another way of detecting the
Hardware/Software etc. from the System without using
lspci or the proc-files...? Something that gets all
the Hardware Information directly from the I/O and not
from the Kernel. The good thing about lspci is that it
does both . But it doesnt say if there is  a CDROM or
floppy-disc... I tryed alot to search for something
like that but without any success. I heard about this
Otopia Project. I google after it but I didnt find
anything usefule. I think its dead.
