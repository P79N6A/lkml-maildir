I thought so too and did a similar transformation while moving
some string functions out of line. After that recent misadventure
I would be very very careful with this.
Overall I'm sorry to say, but the risk:gain ratio of this
patch is imho totally out of whack.
It took a long time to get bitops.h correct and as far as we know
it is compiled correctly currently. You risk all at for very dubious
improvements.
