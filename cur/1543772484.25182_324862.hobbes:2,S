No, no output at all on my (serial) console. Nor does sysrq work; except
for powerOff which really doesn't help :-|, nor does it work with my
current 'good' kernel 2.6.12-rc5-git4-RT-V0.7.47-12. Also any process
touching the X process hangs along with it. I tried strace, gdb etc..
I'll try some more tomorrow..
