> Rusty, what would be needed to "hot-add" CPUs ?
The PPC version at the moment simply locks a cpu in the idle loop
with __cli(); while(1); for cpu down and jumps out of it for cpu up.
Good for testing but not very useful. After talking to paulus we
will use the RTAS cpu stop and cpu start.
In order to bring a new cpu up you will need to duplicate a lot of
the stuff in smp_boot_cpus or else just set up all NR_CPUS of these
structures (eg NR_CPUS idle threads etc) at boot time.
