Stock gcc-3.3.3 or from the hammer branch?  There is, I think, a second
problem that was left out.  The problem with gcc-3.4 + binutils-2.14 is
that -many gets passed, which zeros out previous flags.  -many is fine
in binutils-2.15 (and 2.13 and 2.12 and 2.12.1 it seems), but 2.15 does
require -maltivec to be passed in order to handle altivec instructions.
Getting this right was part of the cleanup that conflicted with the
mpc52xx changes (Andrew: trying to take care of getting this into Linus'
tree now).
