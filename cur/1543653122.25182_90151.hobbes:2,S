it most definitely is. Binary compatibility is taken very seriously.
the SETTID change only affects the fork() case. Ie. there are 4 major ways
a context can be started:
  execve(): here we build a process image from scratch. NPTL changes 
            nothing here, except that if a new NPTL binary is started up,
            it will call sys_set_tid_address() to get the 'initial thread'
            set up properly. Old binaries continue to work.
  fork(): here we build a new process image by copying the parent image. 
          NPTL applications are using sys_clone(CLONE_SETTID) internally, 
          to set up the initial thread of the new process image. [the 
          fork() code in glibc also does other cleanup work to get a true
          initial thread going, even if a threaded application forks, but
          this is nothing the kernel should worry about.]
  pthread_create(): here we create a new thread that shares all sharable 
                    state with the parent thread. LinuxThreads (old glibc) 
                    does whatever it always did, NPTL uses all the new 
                    flags.
  raw clone(): share a subset of the parent thread's resources.
there is no change anywhere due to NPTL. You can start and old glibc
application from within a new glibc application and vice versa.
