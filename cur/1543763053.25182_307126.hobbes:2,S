My main issue with winmodems is not so much the software offload, but 
rather that the vendors don't release full specs.
If all winmodem manufacturers released full hardware specs, I doubt 
people would really complain all that much.  There's a fairly large pool 
of talent available to write drivers once the interfaces are known.
