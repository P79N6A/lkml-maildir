As previously mentioned, you have all the diagnostic tools at your 
disposal already:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks
The badness scoring is straight-forward given that information, so you can 
diagnose why a specific task was not killed and another was chosen.  You 
can also use that information to appropriately tune the oom_adj scores to 
identify your oom killer target preferences.
