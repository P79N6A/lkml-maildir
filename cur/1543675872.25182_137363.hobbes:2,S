Some Pentium 4 chips support HT even when they officially "don't". For 
example, my system has an Intel MB and a Pentium 4 2.8GHz processor; it 
boots using HT just fine. From a recent boot:
Tycho kernel: CPU1: Intel Pentium 4 (Northwood) stepping 07
Tycho kernel: Total of 2 processors activated (11042.81 BogoMIPS).
Tycho kernel: cpu_sibling_map[0] = 1
Tycho kernel: cpu_sibling_map[1] = 0
Tycho kernel: ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Tycho kernel: Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
Tycho kernel: ...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
Tycho kernel: ..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
Tycho kernel: testing the IO APIC.......................
Tycho kernel: .................................... done.
Tycho kernel: Using local APIC timer interrupts.
Tycho kernel: calibrating APIC timer ...
Tycho kernel: ..... CPU clock speed is 2783.0819 MHz.
Tycho kernel: ..... host bus clock speed is 132.0562 MHz.
Tycho kernel: checking TSC synchronization across 2 CPUs: passed.
Tycho kernel: Starting migration thread for cpu 0
Tycho kernel: Bringing up 1
Tycho kernel: CPU 1 IS NOW UP!
Tycho kernel: Starting migration thread for cpu 1
Tycho kernel: CPUS done 2
Note the "132.0562" MHz bus speed.
I obtained my system directly from Intel; however, I know of a few 
people who obtained Pentium 4 chips from retailers, and their processors 
support HT with a 4x133 bus.
