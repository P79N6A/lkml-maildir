After having gone nearly a year without Via hardware to test with or
time to mess with it, I'm looking for someone else interested, capable
and willing to take over maintenance of
drivers/sound/via82cxxx_audio.c.  This is for 2.2 and 2.4 only, as
presumeably ALSA will be merged for 2.5 and they already have a
[sometimes more stable] via audio driver.
