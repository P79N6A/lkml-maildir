I believe (b), but bio is attempting to solve some of the underlying
block device issues.  And all of the IDE stuff is trying to make a good
IDE subsystem.  And so on and so forth.

And rmap isn't in 2.4.  And I don't think it will be, nor IMHO some
parts of -aa.

So, in some corner cases it sucks.  The VM has issues for corner cases
as well, which is why distros include lots of other patches in their
kernels.

I don't think the low-latency, preempt or O(1) should make it into 2.4.
And since Ingo, who wrote this, doesn't think it should go into 2.4
right now, it hopefully won't.
Just because some corner cases can be fixed by massive rewrites doesn't
mean the fix should be backported.  It seems I can't stress this enough,
2.4 is supposed to be _stable_.  And by stable I mean doesn't crash,
lock up, or panic.  Less than ideal VM usage or CPU usage generally
isn't solvable in small easily verifiable patches like fixing crashes,
lock ups and panics are.
I'm not saying people shouldn't use O(1) (or preempt or low-latency or a
half dozen other things not in 2.4 proper), just that they shouldn't go
into 2.4.<current>.  Vendors should decide if they want to add them on
top of a stable base.  Users should decide if they want to add them on
top of a stable base.
