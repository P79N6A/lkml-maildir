This build appears to run OK and then in the middle of the real time
tests stops doing useful work (during network test).
 - can move mouse & switch displays
 - script checking latency hangs (no errors, apparently stuck in sleep)
 - ps is OK, but top does not work (no display, Ctrl-C gives prompt again)
 - cannot ping the test system from another system (don't get the "no route
message, just no response)
 - Alt-SysRq keys still work
 - eventually the mouse would not switch displays
Rebooted with Alt-SysRq-B.
Sending serial console results separately.
