Subject: keyword for rivafb in XF86Confige file

Hello All,
 
I am not able to make my X server work on rivafb (framebuffer module) which is loaded as a module on system.
 
Steps followd by me :-
 
# modprobe rivafb.o
modprobe : Can't locate mnodule rivafb.o
 
So, loaded the rivafb module along with other modules using insmod by checking the dependency list in "modules.dep".
 
I get the rivafb specific debug messages when I switch consoles. But I don't get them when I try to open a GUI Application in my X windows.
 
I edited "XF86Config-4" file
Driver "nvidia" . 
Is it the right keyword to invoke the rivafb driver. I got this on same maillists. Where in the system can I find the database for these keyword stuff.
 
Later, when I say
# startx
It says:-
(EE) Failed to load module "nvidia" (module does not exist, 0)
(EE) No devices detected.
 
What is going wrong here? Is there any other way through which I can tell the X server to use Framebuffer.
 
Please help.
 
My system configuration
Os                linux 7.3(kernel - 2.4.18)
Boot loader       lilo
Default runlevel  3
Framebuffer       rivafb
X server version  4.2.0 
 
Regards,
Mukund jampala
