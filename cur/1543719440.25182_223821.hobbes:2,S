Subject: ext3 probem in 2.4.25 with 4 procs?

  I've just built out a new system running 2.4.25.  It's an IBM with 
Dual HT procs, thus showing 4 procs in /proc/cpuinfo.  On /usr which is 
4 Gigs we've got a weird discrepency.  "du -h" and "df -h" report a 1 
Gig difference.
There used to be a problem with 4procs and ext3.  Does that problem
still exist and can it be related to our odd filesystem reports?
:wq!
