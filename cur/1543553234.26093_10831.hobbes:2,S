http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre9/
 does not have -7.

A -7 to apply to 2.2.18pre17 and _previous_ releases is in the directory
patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre17/. An equivalent one against 2.2.18pre18 (and probably
future releases) is in patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre18/.
After applying the patch you should make sure there are no rejects with a `find
-name \*.rej`.  If there aren't rejects all gone right.
