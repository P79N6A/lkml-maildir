Well, there will be a great number of these laptops sold, not just through
dell, but other brands that buy from compal.  But most of them will be
running Windows, and Windows seem to work fine with it.  So these
companies aren't going to see too many requests unless anyone who's even
considering buying a new laptop complain about this.  Compal provides no
communication channel for the consumers, so we have to go through the big
companies like dell.  When I e-mailed dell's tech support I got a response
from a guy who had *no* idea what linux is.

Wherever the fix comes from, I sure hope it comes soon, because it's
getting harder and harder to find cpus for the original 5000 series.  And
this new model's been sitting on my desk for couple of weeks now
collecting dust.
