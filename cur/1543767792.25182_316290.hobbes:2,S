There seem to be a few iSCSI implementations floating around for Linux,
hopefully one will be added to mainline soon.  Most of those
implementations are for the client side though there is at least one
target implementation that allows you to provide local storage to iSCSI
clients.  I don't remember the name of it or if it's still maintained or
not.
