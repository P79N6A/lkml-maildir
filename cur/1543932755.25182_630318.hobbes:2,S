  Hmm, it's hard to formulate precisely. It's nothing particular but all in
all the code is simply hard to read - all those strange names of variables,
unusual sideeffects of functions, ... But one specific problem I'm aware of
is the lack of error handling so in case of IO error or filesystem
corruption results are quite spectacular (kernel crash, etc.).
