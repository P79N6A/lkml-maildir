So, when I do something like
	mv kernel/fs/x.c kernel/fs/y.c
I also have to do:
	sed -i -e s/kernel\/fs\/x.c/kernel\/fs\/y.c/g kernel/fs/y.c
Won't that, in effect, be breaking a defacto userspace API by changing
message paths, even if the semantic meaning, cause and possible
resolutions are all unchanged?
