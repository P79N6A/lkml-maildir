That is a restriction on CML1, particularly when using any of the
config options that rely on shell scripts.  CONFIG_SGI_IP22 is
undefined for i386 and the shell converts $CONFIG_SGI_IP22 to blank,
before CML1 even sees it.  Doing dep_* on options that might be
undefined is unreliable.  This works :-
if [ "$CONFIG_SGI_IP22" = "y" ]; then
   tristate '  Indy/I2 Hardware Watchdog' CONFIG_INDYDOG
fi
