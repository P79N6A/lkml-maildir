It turns out that I was wrong.  The problem seems not to be X, but a
CD player applet (Gnome).  When it runs, any CD burning operation
causes a panic.  When it does not, burning and blanking works fine,
gcombust or not.  I was probably mislead into my former diagnosis by
the fact that I only recently started using that applet, same as I
only recently set up the RAID and moved disks around.
  Anyway, the bug's still there, and I'm still willing to provide more
info on demand.
Roland.
