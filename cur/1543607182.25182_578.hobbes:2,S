Same with the other mainframe systems, using something like SMP (System
Mangling/Management Product) to track the interdependencies.  But that
only works when almost all of the patches come from a single source
which does integration testing before releasing them.  This method does
not work well with multiple sources, look at the hassles third party
vendors have to go through to keep up with IBM patches.
