Hello,
I would like to know which new features are planed to be incorported by
ext4. So far I only read about supporting bigger filesystems to fit
recent hardware developments. So are there any other big goals for ext4?
What I personally would like to see most in ext4 are
        * checksums for data
        * and snapshots on filesystem basis
But I guess that this is way out of scope for ext4.
