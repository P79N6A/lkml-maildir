Both i386 and x86_64 currently need 2 and if other arches start using 
quicklists then they would have the same issues. There may be other 
cases in the future where these may be useful. So I think this is too 
inflexible.

Is there a way of checking if a CONFIG_xxx is set to any value?
Then we could do
config QUICKLISTS
	depends on defined(NR_QUICK)
Alternately we could replace #ifdef CONFIG_QUICKLISTS with
#ifdef CONFIG_NR_QUICK ?
