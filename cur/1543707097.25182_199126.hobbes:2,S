Side note: a UTF-8 program needs to do escape handling _anyway_, because 
even if the filename is 100% UTF-8 compliant, you still can't print out 
all the characters as such. In particular, charcters like '\n' etc are 
obviously perfectly fine UTF-8, yet they need to be escaped when printing 
out filenames in a file selector.
So I claim (and yes, people are free to disagree with me) that a
well-written UTF-8 program won't even have any real extra code to handle
the "broken UTF-8" code. It's just another set of bytes that needs
escaping, and they need escaping for _exactly_ the same reason some 
regular utf-8 characters need escaping: because they can't be printed.
So it's all the same thing - it's just the reasons for "unprintability"  
that are slightly different.
Now, I'll agree that getting the escaping right (whether for things like 
'\n' or for byte sequences that are invalid UTF-8) can be painful. I just 
don't think that the pain is in any way specific for "invalid UTF-8". It's 
just _hard_ to think of all the special cases, and most programs have bugs 
because somebody forgot something.
