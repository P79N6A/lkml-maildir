2.4.22 this time, on Xeon x335, / is raid1+ext3, journal size=128M
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/jama bs=1M count=1000
on other softraid servers I have, this gets load to 3-4 , performance is
bad, the same behaviour is present, but tolerable.
Dual Xeon(exact same HW and conf with 2 cpus) now is about tolerable also
single  Xeon, with or without ht, still gets very stuck, load goes quickly
7-9, ls /directoryNotInCache takes 10 secs, cpu is idle, related processes
are in D state, as / is on same raid,everything sucks like hell..
additionally, something that might give a clue: when I mount the partition
with noatime, load gets quickly to 30...40..50
