There is nothing wrong with sbrk or malloc. The kernel just doesn't
really provide the use of the address range when requested. ANY method
of touching memory after the sbrk call is subject to race conditions.
It just may not occur in a single processor environment very often.
In the SMP world it can easily occur.
Malloc returns null if allocation fails - it can fail only when the kernel
tells the process it will not allocate more via sbrk.
"never page-out my stack" is unreasonable, especially for large jobs
that may need a very large stack. The stack frames may not be referenced
very often. It isn't that often that large buffers are created there.
There are pointers to buffers there, and usually only the current stack
frame is used for these.
