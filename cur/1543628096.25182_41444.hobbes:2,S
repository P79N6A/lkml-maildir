Faster?  BK has no impact on the fundamentals of code development.  Only
on the problem of merging code.  Only when the bottle neck is merge speed
does it really come into play.  
For Linus this is obviously a very important issue.  For some of the
rest of us it is less so.
For myself I find great benefit in reviewing my own patches, and in
having other people look at them and review them.  I may be wrong
but I do not see bitkeeper helping in that regard (except reduce
the noise of renames).
