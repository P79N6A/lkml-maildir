Hi all,
I am trying to understand how skb->csum is used to calculate the
tcp checksum.
My problem is re-calculate the tcp checksum, when i recieve the 
packet at the ip_rcv() function. I am trying to change the destination
IP address and recalculate the tcp checksum for that.
Can any help me out with this.
bye,
prakash
