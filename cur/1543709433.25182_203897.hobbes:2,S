Andrew,
Sorry if I was unclear.  These are suffexes from RH AS 3.0 kernel
namings.  "SMP" corresponds to normal SMP kernel they have,  "hugemem"
is kernel with 4G/4G split.

Huh. The numbers shall be other way around of course :)   "smp" kernel
had better performance of some 7000TPM, compared to  4500TPM with
HugeMem kernel. 
Swap was disable in both cases.
