Yes, I know you patch don't need it (thought you commented the patch vs. 
dgrs.c, not vs. you patch). But to do that, you have to introduce a new 
dgrs-specific pci-layer to compensate. If you don't want to have an 
empty struct, is it not nicer/easier to just #ifdef CONFIG_PCI the 
pci_*-functions? (instead of two inline functions for every used 
pci_*-function?)
Am thinking of removing the #ifdef CONFIG_PCI's in other files, to 
"clean up" the code, but that would introduce this problem again, don't 
you think it is more readable to make an empty struct when !CONFIG_PCI, 
then making new pci_*-functions specific to the driver?
