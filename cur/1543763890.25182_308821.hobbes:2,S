It's a wee bit confusing, but I think it all works out.
Doing ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE=y turns off the FLATMEM option in the
mm/Kconfig prompt because FLATMEM depends on !ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE.
So, if you enable it, it will end up being the default because there's
no other choice.
For configs that *need* both options, you can re-enable FLATMEM with
ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE
