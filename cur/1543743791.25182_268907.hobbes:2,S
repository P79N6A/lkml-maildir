This means breaking all layering and passing mempool pointer all the way
down to the lowest layer allocators (like bio and drivers). The only
practical way to do this, is to put mempool pointer into current
task_struct. At which point it's no different from having per-thread
list of pages that __alloc_pages() looks into before falling back to
per-cpu page-sets and buddy. _Except_ in the latter case, reservation is
handled transparently in __alloc_pages() and code shouldn't be adjusted
to check for mempool in zillion of places.

I think you are confusing "file system" and "ext2". I definitely know
from experience that with some file system types, system can be oommed
without any significant user-level allocation activity. Now, one can say
that either such file-systems are broken, or Linux MM lacks support for
features (like reservation) they need.

I don't see what advantages mempools have over page reservation handled
directly by page allocator, like in
