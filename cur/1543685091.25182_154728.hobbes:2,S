I've been testing AIO using Andrew's -mm kernels which includes
many AIO patches.  I've written some copy tests using AIO.
The libaio-0.3.93.tar ball has source to the library and man pages.
What kind of examples are you looking for?
I do not think AIO supports sockets, yet.  I would ask on the
linux-aio mailing list.
There was an interesting paper from the 2003 Linux Symposium on AIO:
