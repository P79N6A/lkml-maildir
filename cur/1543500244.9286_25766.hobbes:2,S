Subject: [PATCH] interceptors-0.3, kernel 2.3.8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It's very difficult to extend kernel functionality
without recompiling. "Interceptors" can help :-).
description:
             _SAFE_ way to intercept kernel events.
Two exported functions:
             previous = register_interceptor( handler, type );
             unregister_interceptor( handler, type );
Currently supported operations to intercept:
             character device
             block device (in this version file operations only)
             system calls
Goals:
             simple STREAMS replacement (with almost ZERO performance loss!)
             provides new functionality for modules.
             some existing patches may now be distributed as modules.
Tested:
             Slightly, on i386 only.
The patch is against 2.3.8.
                         Best regards.
