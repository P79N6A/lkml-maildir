I found a situation where page->index for a pagetable page can be set
to 0 instead of the correct value.  This means that ptep_to_address
will return the wrong answer.  The problem occurs when remap_pmd_range
calls pte_alloc_map and pte_alloc_map needs to allocate a new pte
page, because remap_pmd_range has masked off the top bits of the
address (to avoid overflow in the computation of `end'), and it passes
the masked address to pte_alloc_map.
Now we presumably don't need to get from the physical pages mapped by
remap_page_range back to the ptes mapping them.  But we could easily
map some normal pages using ptes in that pagetable page subsequently,
and when we call ptep_to_address on their ptes it will give the wrong
answer.
The patch below fixes the problem.
There is a more general question this brings up - some of the
procedures which iterate over ranges of ptes will do the wrong thing
if the end of the address range is too close to ~0UL, while others are
OK.  Is this a problem in practice?  On i386, ppc, and the 64-bit
architectures it isn't since user addresses can't go anywhere near
~0UL, but what about arm or m68k for instance?
And BTW, being able to go from a pte pointer to the mm and virtual
address that that pte maps is an extremely useful thing on ppc, since
it will enable me to do MMU hash-table management at set_pte (and
ptep_*) time and thus avoid the extra traversal of the pagetables that
I am currently doing in flush_tlb_*.  So if you do decide to back out
rmap, please leave in the hooks for setting page->mapping and
page->index on pagetable pages.
Paul.
