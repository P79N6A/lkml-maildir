Fine. Just set it up at boot to the amount of icache you want. 16000 is a
good value for a server (of course it depends how much memory do you have
:).

No. Don't look at inode-nr. You must only verify if the "inode-max limit
reached" message triggers again or not with the new value.
The numbers in inode-nr have nothing to do with the number of inodes
actually in-use. It only say you how much memory is allocated for the
inode cache. It's more an information for developers.

You probably needs lots of inodes for the squid files and for the network
connections, thus increasing inode-max when you get the message from the
kernel is the right thing to do and it's _not_ a sign of an inode leak.
It's instead the way we prevent inodes to leak ;).
