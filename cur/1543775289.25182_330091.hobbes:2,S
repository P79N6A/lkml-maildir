There's always exceptions! ;-)
As Jörn mentioned, you don't just use spin_lock_irqsave just to keep from
thinking, which I totally agree, but most of the time I use spin_locks, it
is better to not let interrupts flow, and for this reason, I try to keep
the places that use spin_locks as short as possible, since I don't want
100ms latencies.
