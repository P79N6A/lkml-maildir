Ok, I know ioctl is bad, but please tell me how to replace them, that's
all I want to know. Did you propose any other mechanism which could
replace ioctl? Or do you think such things (eject the cdrom) are not
meant to be done from applications?
I certainly don't insist on using them, but I don't see (yet) any way
how to replace them. Please enlighten me.
