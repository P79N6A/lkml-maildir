I should probably split the patch in two: One that does that behaviour
change (I already have an Acked-by: Len Brown for that one even :) and
one adding that notifier.

Well... people already use it and go check the bus types :)
Having a notifier queue per bus type is a bit harder though because bus
types are generally allocated statically and thus we would need to find
them all in the kernel to add a proper static initialisation for the
notifier queue... bus_register() is not a good spot to do it because
platform code might want to register for bus types before those bus
types have been registered (it's not always easy to find a place to
"hook" between a bus is registered and things get added to it).
In fact, the whole bus type thing is a mess :) We can't easily register
for bus types that are in modules. 
For example, if I want to use the notifier to catch USB devices in order
to, for example, link them to firmware nodes, I'm lost if the USB
subsystem is modular ... unless I use a global notifier and strcmp the
bus type name in there.
So at this point, I'd rather stay on a global notifier.
Ben.
