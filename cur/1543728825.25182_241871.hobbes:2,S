If I understand correctly, you don't need that. Just don't map the ROM
before somebody explicitly requests it -- be it either some driver
or sysfs. In both cases, the PCI subsystem is already initialized.

Yes, but it's no excuse for writing code which triggers these problems
if there is an easy way how to do that more safely.

BTW, if the card doesn't share decoders, is there any need to create
a copy of the ROM? If not, no memory gets wasted.
				Have a nice fortnight
