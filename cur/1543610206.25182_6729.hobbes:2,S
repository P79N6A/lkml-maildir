Finding filenames by trial and error is hopeless.
It is _much_ easier to find the root
password by trial and error and then change the permissions
and list in the normal way.  
There is only one root password to guess, but you think
having to guess _every_ filename is insecure?
A x-only directory is much safer than user security
will ever be - you effectively have a password per file.

But is that useful?
Sure, I can list filenames.  I can't get at filesize
or permissions.  I can't open the files.  How
is that useful?  Of course locking people
out is useful, but why should they need to read
the filenames?
