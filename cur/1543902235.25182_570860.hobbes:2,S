I haven't been keeping notes quite as studiously as I should have been, 
but this just occurred with 2.6.22.1 + the hrt6 patch + your proposed fix:

I came to the above explanation after failing to find another path that 
clears the SIGQUEUE_PREALLOC flag.  Some form of memory corruption could 
be to blame.

Noticed right after I sent the patch out.  My goal was to validate and 
lock the timer through a single interface, but itimer_delete() and 
posix_timer_fn() currently recieve a k_itimer * instead of a timer_t.  I 
should have reworked them.

Thanks for the reply,
