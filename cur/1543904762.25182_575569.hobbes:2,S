    Fix rmmod/read/write races in /proc entries
Broke ioctl() on /proc/bus/pci/* files for COMPAT platforms.
proc_fops->ioctl() is defined for these PCI device files, and the
COMPAT ioctl is handled via fs/compat_ioctl.c's entries, which makes
it just call the ->ioctl() handler directly.
proc_fops->compat_ioctl is NULL for these files, it isn't needed.
This used to work because we used to jump right to the de->proc_fops,
but now we have these wrappers and proc_reg_compat_ioctl is what
gets called and since proc_fops->compat_ioctl is NULL we return
ENOTTY instead of calling proc_fops->ioctl().
Two ways to fix:
1) Make the PROC wrapper call ->unlocked_ioctl() or ->ioctl()
   as a fallback of ->compat_ioctl is NULL.
2) Make proc_bus_pci_operations provide a .compat_ioctl method,
   but then we'll need to audit the entire tree for cases like
   this and make the same fix.
Because it's easier to validate that all cases are covered,
I think #1 is the preferred fix.
