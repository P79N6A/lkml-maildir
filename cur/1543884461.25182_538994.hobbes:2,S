The usage cases of yours are quite different from mine. We don't use a
single file descriptor to to manage various resources. The worker threads
are _not going_ to have a file descriptor, _only_ the event dispatching 
(poll)
thread. The worker threads are just going to increase the futex value and
call FUTEX_WAKE in case the previous value was 0.
A pollable futex is even more useful for _single_ threaded programs that
don't want to go into lengthy hacks to monitor events coming from the 
outside
world.
I, at least, don't want to port my epoll applications to yet another event
notification facility.

No. 12 patches are for i386/x86_64 obligatory syscall housekeeping. I don't
want to sound rude, but have you actually looked at the patches?
