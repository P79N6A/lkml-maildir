Is this different from the v61b5 stuff? I can test it on my qla2310
and ISP1020 if need be.
The main issue with qlogicisp.c is that it's just not modern enough to
keep up with the rest of the system so testing with it is basically a
stress test for how things hold up with lots of highmem, lots of bounce
buffering and with a severely limited ability to perform disk I/O.
qlogicisp.c is also not very reflective of the hardware used in NUMA-Q
systems in the field, it just happened to be available from the scrap heap.
Thanks,
Bill
