I upgraded from 2.2.5 to 2.2.10-pre-no-way-of-telling-anymore and an out
of memory condition[1] killed init again. It would be nice if this weren't
possible as it's kind of nice to have init around.. I can't see anything
that tries to prevent it anywhere between oom() and send_sig_info(). Can a
simple check be added to oom()? Or is it too messy to recover from not
being able to to put_dirty_page()?
[1] The cause was determined to be a CGI perl script doing an SQL query to
Postgres generating a monster table.
