G'day Linus, mate
Could you pull the dmapool branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git please?
All the patches have been posted to linux-kernel before, and various
comments (and acks) have been taken into account.
It's a fairly nice performance improvement, so would be good to get in.
It's survived a few hours of *mumble* high-stress database benchmark,
so I have high confidence in its stability.
