I still don't like this change. Apart from being harder to read in
my opinion, I don't believe there is a precedent for "consolidating"
simple for loops in the kernel, is there?
More complex loops get helpers, but they're made part of the wider
well-known kernel API.
Why does for_each_priority_reverse blow up when you pass it an unsigned
argument? What range has priority? What direction does the loop go in?
(_reverse postfix doesn't tell me, because it is going from low->high
priority so I would have thought that is going forward, or up)
You had to look in two places each time you wanted to know the answers.
