Subject: [Patch 4/7] 2.4.20-pre4/ext3: Sanity check for Intermezzo/ext3 interactions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

From Andreas Dilger:
Nowhere in journal_start() (or more specifically in start_this_handle()
is any sanity checking on the number of blocks requested for a single
handle done.  If you request more than journal_size/4 blocks for a handle
it will loop endlessly on repeat_locked: trying to "free" enough blocks
to satisfy the request.  The below patch validates the number of blocks
requested is small enough to actually be allocated, otherwise returns
-ENOSPC.
