Sorry,
 I forgot to attach the feature list present in dj2..

Differences between 2.2.2ac7.dj2 and 2.2.2ac7.dj1
o       drivers/pci/quirks.c
        Now pokes the correct chip. The VIA VT82C597AT
o       arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
        CPU stepping no longer prints leading zero.
o       arch/i386/kernel/time.c
        Changed CPU speed reporting from Hz to Mhz.
        How many CPU's have you seen running in Hz ? :)
o       drivers/char/nvram.c
        Removed leading space from hd0 type.
        Added recognition for 2.88M 3.5" drive.
Differences between 2.2.2ac7.dj1 and 2.2.2ac7:
o       lib/vsprintf.c
        Now prints strings with '%%' in them as '%'.
        Should stop strange texts in dmesg output.  
        Could this be 'the longest-living bug in Linux' as mentioned in
	the CREDITS file by Lars Wirzenius ? :-)
o       drivers/pci/quirks.c
        Added bridge optimisation for VIA 82C586 chipset.
        Fullstops added to some strings that had them missing.
o       drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c
        Added support for DLink CT528 (
http://www.dlink.com
)
        This ugly is a clone of a RealTek 8029, which is a clone of an
	NE2k. Most bizarre. Even more bizarre, they used almost the same
	PCI info, so adding code to read the subsystem was necessary.
o       arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
        Removed two unused vars.
o       arch/sparc64/kernel/cpu.c
        Corrected typo "Unknow CPU"
