Two other things to think about:
What happens when the userland program waits too long before flushing? 
It just keeps writing command after command.
Since one of the goals of this conversation was to figure out how to get
away from requiring X for display.  I assume you are leaning towards
frame buffer consoles.  What happens when there is a virtual console
switch before the program flushes its buffer?
