CONFIG_PCMCIA=m works more or less, with the current tree.  At least,
there don't seem to be obvious problems with the build.  The standard
PCMCIA startup script, however, doesn't know how to load the right
modules in the right order.
If you first make sure that PCMCIA is unloaded, then do:
   modprobe pci_socket
   modprobe ds
   cardmgr
I think that may give you a functional setup, if you've selected
CardBus support as a module.
I've verified that a 3CCFE575BT card works with this setup on 2.3.45.
Unloading the modules or ejecting the card does bad things.  16-bit
cards don't currently work for me because of a problem with interrupt
probing in the yenta driver.
