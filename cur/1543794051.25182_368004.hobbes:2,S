We do things like this:
  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM="scsi", SYSFS{type}=="1", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 900 > /sys/$DEVPATH/timeout'"
There are only very few users now, that set values in sysfs. If that is
a common need to change values with udev rules we may integrate that into
udev itself, instead of calling a shell, but that works fine so far.
