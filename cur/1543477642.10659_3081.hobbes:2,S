Unfortunately, this has probably come up way too late for 2.2, which is a
shame because that's precisely where it's valuable. Maybe all the
distribution vendors will pick it up independently.  :)  My patch that
builds .config into the kernel (I'll post it later today after I test it a
bit) stands a couple orders of magnitude less chance, though it has quite
a bit more diagnostic value.

I thought about a couple different schemes for the name files. Another is
having a special directory for them, which is nice as it allows you to do
away with the name prefix and the nasty sed pipe (or Makefile hackery).
But I think there's some value to having them in the top-level where
you're less likely to miss them when you do a build. Unless you're Alan or
Linus and are constantly merging patches, this won't be a problem, as
you'll probably have no more than a few of these.
