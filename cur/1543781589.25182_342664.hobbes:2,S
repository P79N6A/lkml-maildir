Yeah, I took out my "bad" fix and it still locks up. Since I got the NMI
working I was able to get output. Unfortunately, the laptop doesn't have
a serial (damn vendors getting rid of the very useful _for us_ uart).
And so far the netconsole doesn't seem to be working yet. 
Here's the output (typed from screen).

This is on bootup.  The stopmachine is used in sys_init_module.

I guess I'll need to look into this further.
