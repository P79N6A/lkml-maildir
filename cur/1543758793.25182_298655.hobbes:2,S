Not necessaruly, because the rules could be more relaxed during -rc stage
in an odd release, and stable releases could be shorter, so at the end, the
"patch fridge" would be needed only between the very end of the odd version
and the start of the even one.
Another possibility is for developpers to start to submit/merge patches for
the next odd release while the even one is still in -rc.

if there is so much pending stuff, why not sacrifice 2.6.12, use 2.6.13
to fix a bit and merge even more, then 2.6.14 would be the real first
stable release ?
