I see, but the question is how do I test in C preprocessor that glibc is 
sufficiently new to react on them?
Now I changed it to:
#ifdef __linux__
#if !defined(__GLIBC__) || __GLIBC__ < 2 || (__GLIBC__ == 2 && __GLIBC_MINOR__ < 1)
#include <asm/unistd.h>
#ifdef __NR__llseek
#define use_llseek
static _syscall5(int, _llseek, uint, fd, ulong, hi, ulong, lo, loff_t *, 
res, uint, wh);
#endif
#endif
So we see if someone else runs into problem.
