well, that's bad. We'd silently ignore the " = 1" and boot up with that 
value at 0, right? At minimum we need some really prominent build-time 
_errors_ (i.e. aborted builds) if this ever happens. But ideally, 
shouldnt this whole thing be done at link time? Couldnt the linker sort 
the variables that are zero initialized into the right section, and move 
this constant maintenance pressure off the programmer's shoulder?
