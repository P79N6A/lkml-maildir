I believe I pointed at the patch required to fix the problem via this
URL:
  
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=5010/1
A subset of that patch had also already been discussed between Philipp,
akpm and myself.  The URL also shows when it was applied (though not to
a branch of my tree I could've pushed into mainline at that stage.)
The fix was already known...  The fix had been pointed out by me during
the various mails I got about the breakage...  I'd effectively already
approved the fix by applying it...  And I had said I wouldn't be able to
sort it until Thursday.
Yes, maybe I should've said to Andrew "please grab this patch off this
URL and ensure it gets to Linus ASAP."  Hind sight is always a wonderful
thing.
