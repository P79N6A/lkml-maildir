That code certainly wasn't optimized for ia64.  Furthermore, I also do
not like the prefetch distance it's using.  In fact, in my ia64-patch,
I use the following code instead:
		prefetchw(pmd + j + PREFETCH_STRIDE/sizeof(*pmd));
This is more sensible (because it really does prefetch by the
PREFETCH_STRIDE distance) and it also happens to run (slightly) faster
on Itanium.
