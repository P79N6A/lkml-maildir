Well, if you do this, and I can, I will start using the code too. I don't know 
x86/x86_64/ppc/... assembly enough that I could help, but I would be willing 
to drop the current code if yours was usable. Come to that, (as I already 
said), I'm willing to work on switching to pbes prior to that and seeing if 
we can share that code earlier, if you want me to and I can find the time.

Maybe I have tunnel vision, but I'd be surprised if you didn't end up with 
something similar - I've tried to make it as simple as possible, and am 
basically doing the same thing (even if I'm using different terms for some of 
the concepts). I'd certainly be willing to interact on "Why did you do it 
this way?" questions and make changes if a better way is shown to me.

Thank you! I much prefer this kind of interaction. It's far more constructive.
