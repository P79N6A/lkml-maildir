Err, no, the sync flag is a wonderful idea.  I use sync on jump drives
(although I won't now that I've read about this problem) because I can
copy a file to it and as soon as the green light stops flashing I can
yank it out without bothering to click or type anything to "eject" it.
Requiring "eject" on removable media is a dumb idea.
Perhaps FAT updates could be cached and delayed until some # of ms after
the last write.
Turning the sync flag off and adjusting the values
in /proc/sys/vm/dirty_* would have the same effect, but would change it
on all devices, not just removables.
Maybe we need a way to set dirty_* per block device?
