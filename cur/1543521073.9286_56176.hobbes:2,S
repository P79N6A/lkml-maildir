Well, money talks and ... you know the rest. 
The writing of efficient program and the writing of clean programs are not
mutually exclusive. Of course, your attitude is what allows me and others
to get nicer margins - a lot of people design unecessarily expensive
hardware. 
If you manefacture anything in larger scale the manefacturing price is
everything. Most devices are not really changed or at least their taks it
not changed. I have no interest in having my elevator control being able
to play mp3:s, I just want it to move me between floors safely. 
Anyway, I am convinced there will still be a lot of older architectures in
use by 2038.
