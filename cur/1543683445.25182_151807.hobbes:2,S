Andrew's patch makes it work, the system boots fine with raid and devfs
mounted automatically.
Also using root=/dev/md/2 as boot option works (just tried).
Before the patch I tried with root=/dev/md2, that is what I'm using with
2.4, but didn't work. The error message is:
VFS: cannot open root device "md2" or md2
please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root fs on md2
Let me know if you need more info, but I think the sysfs
explanation is right.
Bye.
