Subject: [PATCH] fix RTNL-locking in tun/tap driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Current tun/tap driver sets also net device's hw address when asked to
change character device's hw address. This is a good idea, but it
misses RTLN-locking, resulting following error message in
2.6.25-rc3's inetdev_event() function:
RTNL: assertion failed at net/ipv4/devinet.c (1050)
Attached patch fixes this problem.
