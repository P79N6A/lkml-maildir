WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE is a bit of a hack to fix up specific peculiarities of
the interaction between tmpfs and page reclaim.
Trond, the changelog for that patch does not explain what is going on in
there - can you help out?
Also, what's the theory behind the handling of BDI_write_congested and
nfs_wait_on_write_congestion() in nfs_writepages()?  From a quick peek it
looks like NFS should be waking the sleepers in blk_congestion_wait()
rather than doing it privately?

yup.  We should be able to handle the throttling and writeback scheduling
from within core VFS/VM.  NFS should set and clear the backing_dev
congestion state appropriately and the VFS should take care of the rest. 
The missing bit is the early blk_congestion_wait() termination.
