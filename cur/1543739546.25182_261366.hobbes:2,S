I don't think this is comparable, see below.

It not about a future guarantee; the information as to whether the data
is corrupt or not is available at the time when select() is called and POSIX
requires it to be.
You _chose_ to implement your select() in a way that is not POSIX

Hardly so.

would is meant here as "if you were to call recvmsg(), then" and not as
"may or may not..".
Your interpretation of select() is that it merely provides a hint that the
socket may be ready; that may be convenient for you, but it is not what
POSIX describes.

I think it is different. The first recvmsg() from one of these processes
doesn't block; it is the recvmsg() on that file descriptor that select()
guarantees will not block.
