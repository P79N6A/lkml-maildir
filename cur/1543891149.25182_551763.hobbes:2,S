I'd like to see the "stat" file documented (I always have to go looking
for it).  Thanks to Bharadwaj Yadavalli[1] and fs/proc/array.c, I've got
most of it, but I'm not an expert in this area.  :)  I've included my
"pending" patch below for reference.
Can someone give me a short description of the following fields?
  wchan
  exit_signal
  policy
  blkio_ticks
Thanks,
-Kees

 1.2 Kernel data
 ---------------
 
 Similar to  the  process entries, the kernel data files give information about
 the running kernel. The files used to obtain this information are contained in
-/proc and  are  listed  in Table 1-3. Not all of these will be present in your
+/proc and  are  listed  in Table 1-4. Not all of these will be present in your
 system. It  depends  on the kernel configuration and the loaded modules, which
 files are there, and which are missing.
