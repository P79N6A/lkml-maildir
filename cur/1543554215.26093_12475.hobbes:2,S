We can mess with the ABI, but it requires a wholescale rev of the
entire system.  We have had such revs before -- each major rev of libc
is one -- but they are incredibly painful.  However, if we find
ourselves in a situation where there are enough reasons to introduce
libc.so.7 then perhaps looking at some revs to the ABI might be in
order -- passing arguments in registers and aligning the stack to 64
bits probably would be the main items.
