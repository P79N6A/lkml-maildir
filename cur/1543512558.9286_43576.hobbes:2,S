This is a peripheral issue. Not relevant. Off track... Let's
concede with the exception that this is unimportant, not to
mention the fact that ACL is not clearly defined, at least
with respect for implementation/standard.

What is the sum total of all problems addressed by your scheme?
What I like about devfs is that we skirt issues by simply not
going down problematic roads, and all while keeping compatibility.
I appologize for not fully understanding your idea, but I was
either kicked from the list or M-Sexchange barfed and I was
bouncing emails.
