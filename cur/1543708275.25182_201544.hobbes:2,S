The problem was that the Tyan I found which did 64/66 was a dual 
processor board (not a problem) that had a maximum FSB of 266mhz (or 
maybe it was 200?).  I would have been stuck with dual Athlon XP 2400+ 
(or worse), rather than something faster like the 2800+ I have.  Well, 
the dual would be faster if I were running multi-threaded applications, 
but most of the CPU-intensive stuff I tend to tinker with is 
single-threaded and also memory-intensive, making the single 2800+ more 
attractive (I could have gotten the 3000+, but the cost increase wasn't 
worth the small performance increase).
