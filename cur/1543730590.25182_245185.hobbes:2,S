Hi Stephen, thanks for your comment.

Indeed, spin_lock/spin_unlock should be replaced by spin_lock_irqsave/restore.
I fixed it.
The attached take3-patch is modified as follows:
- avc_node_dual was eliminated by Paul E.McKenny's suggestion.
  avc_update_node() calls kmalloc() and may return -ENOMEM.
  (But, I think this effect is so limited.)
- All list_for_each_entry() were replaced by list_for_each_entry_rcu().
- All spin_lock()/spin_unlock() were replaced by spin_lock_irqsave()
  /spin_unlock_restore().
- In avc_node_insert(), if an entry with the same ssid/tsid/tclass as new
  one exists, the older entry is replaced by the new one.
Thanks. I want to make it the last edition hopefully. :)
