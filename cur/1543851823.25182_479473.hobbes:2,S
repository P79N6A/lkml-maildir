msr is a msg_receiver structure. The structure is stored on the stack of 
msr->r_tsk.
The smp_mb() guarantees that the wake_up_process is complete before 
ERR_PTR(res) is stored into msr->r_msg.

The codes tries to to a lockless receive:
- the mutex is only required to create/destroy queues.
- normal queue operations are protected by msg_lock(msqid), which is a 
spinlock. One spinlock for each queue.
- if a receiving thread doesn't find a message, then it adds a 
msg_receiver structure into msq->q_receivers. This linked list is stored 
in the message queue structure and protected by msg_lock(msqid).
- if a sending thread finds a msg_receiver structure, then it removes 
the structure from the msq->q_receivers linked list, places the message 
into msr->r_msg and wakes up the receiver. All operations happen under 
msg_lock(msqid)
- the receiver notices that there is a message in it's msr->r_msg 
structure and copies it to user space, without acquiring msg_lock(msqid).
ipc/sem.c uses the same idea, I added a longer block with documentation 
(around line 150 in ipc/sem.c)
I'm only aware of one tricky race:
- the sender calls wake_up_process().
- as soon as the receiver finds something in r_msg, it can return to 
user space. user space can call exit(3). do_exit destroys the task 
structure.
- wake_up_process will cause an oops if it's called after do_exit().
This race happened on s390. The solution is this block:
                msr->r_msg = NULL;
                wake_up_process(msr->r_tsk);
                smp_mb();
                msr->r_msg = ERR_PTR(res);
Initially, r_msg is ERR_PTR(-EAGAIN). The sender first sets it to NULL 
("message pending"), then calls wake_up_process(), then a memory 
barrier, then the final value.
Back to the bug report:
"volatile" shouln't be necessary. The critical part is this loop:
                msg = (struct msg_msg*)msr_d.r_msg;
                while (msg == NULL) {
                        cpu_relax();
                        msg = (struct msg_msg *)msr_d.r_msg;
                }
And cpu_relax is a barrier().
On i386, removing the "volatile" has no effect, the .o remains identical.
Falk, could you compare the .o files with/without volatile? Are there 
any differences?
The oops was caused by try_to_wake_up, called by expunge_all.
I.e.:
- either the msq->q_receivers linked list got corrupted
- or the target thread was destroyed before wake_up_process completed.
Theoretically, both things are impossible:
- msq->q_receivers is protected by msq_lock()
- the target thread task_struct is guaranteed to remain in scope due to 
the "msg == NULL" loop.
I'll try to reproduce the oops on i386 - but I don't see a bug right now.
