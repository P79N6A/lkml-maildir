Some problems and oddities I have seen:
UP, no preempt
* nfs gets stuck sometimes.  klogd and rpciod shares the cpu,
  umounting is impossible.  cat'ing a nfs file shows the
  contents but the cat process won't die.  Stuck on close?
  This also happens with 2.5.30
* ide-cd is broken as module
SMP, with and without preempt.
* During boot I get atkbd not present(ed), and the keyboard 
  is disabled.  It wakes up later in the boot process, so
  no big trouble here.
* raid has trouble, even with 4k maximum bio's.
  The bootup e2fsck complains that it can't find a valid
  superblock on my raid-1 and raid-0 devices, although
  mount has no trouble.  I get logged complaints about
  e2fsck using outdated ioctl's for md.  Strange that
  fsck should needs to know about raid devices.
  Possibly a problem with e2fsck 1.27?
