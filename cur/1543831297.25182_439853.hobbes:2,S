The later patch as posted has no effect on such platforms because it
does not touch anything but the architecture code. Without that its
random what happens because the CPU cannot enforce write only but the
fault handler tries to. That means if you fault reading because the page
is not present you may get a fault while if you access a page which is
present you won't get a fault.
That gets quite random and has bizarre effects.
