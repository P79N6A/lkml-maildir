I'm afraid that I completely and utterly disagree. Kernel messages are _not_ 
sentences. The vast majority is not well-formed and does not contain any of 
the elements that are required for a proper sentence.
The most kernel messages can be compared to is a rather diverse and sloppy 
enumeration. And enumerations follow completely different rules than 
sentences. It can better be characterized as a "semi-random sequence of 
context-sensitive technical messages".
IMHO the existing rule that "Kernel messages do not have to be terminated 
with a period." is completely justified, though it does need some minor 
clarification on the cases in which proper punctuation _should_ be 
followed.
