If <stuff> was that fast, maybe the down/up should have been a spinlock
too.  But what if it is changed to:
      BKL_enter_mutx()
      down(sem)
      <stuff>
      up(sem)
      BKL_exit_mutex()

The key is to keep the fast stuff on the spinlock and the slow stuff on
the mutex.  Otherwise you WILL eat up the cpu with the overhead.

They will *want* to change if they pop up due to other work :)
