I had good results by using "renice" to give the uploading
ftp process higher priority.  Waiting on a busy network link
blocks often, and in situations where you've got plenty of
bandwidth you actually want ftp to have a lower priority
than your interactive traffic.  Renice was effective in
giving ftp a higher priority.
