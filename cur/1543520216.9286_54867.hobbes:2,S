I belive redhat-6.1 has the following in its /etc/conf.modules or
modules.conf
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
If not i syuggest you add it.
Now if you type;
modprobe lp
and then try to cat your file to /dev/lp0 then that should work.
Then you can go about trying out the GUI printing stuff.
The kernel you have does have lp compiled as a module.
