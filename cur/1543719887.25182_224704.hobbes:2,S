Nah, just a string of curses unfit for the general public, or even lkml.

I've been trying to blame this one on various other bugs until
recently.  The test case posted above is the first simple test that is
supposed to be able to reproduce.  Since ext2 also sees data corruption
issues, it's either not ext3 specific or two different bugs.

Thanks.  jeffm had worked out something similar that stored the EIP of
each bit operation, the uptodate bit seems to have turned off all on its
own.  Once we can reproduce reliably on local boxes, we'll start
layering on the debugging code.  
No triggers yet, I might have to grab a bigger machine in the morning.
