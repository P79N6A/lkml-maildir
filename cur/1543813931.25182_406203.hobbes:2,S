Whatever "knee-jerk" means, I'm not "USA-bashing" as such - at most I'm
"copyright"-bashing (opposed to modern authors rights. Copyright is also
somewhat the predecessor of modern authors rights so there is room to
improve there.) and/or just reminding several people that US law is not
the only relevant in the world.

Yes, I'm not a lawyer, but I do know some parts of it enough to have an
opinion. And when it comes to details and special circumstances, the
specialists should speak up.
