A. Up to 2.6.21 there was only a b44 PCI driver. So you get used to it working 
with the same machine for years and compiling kernels for it.
B. Now there are obviously some changes due to the "bus-glue". OK so far!
But: The help text in both cases is exactly the same. And exactly that is the 
misleading point!
The best way to put up a very clear distinction is to use some examples to 
explain the different cases. Now if you can offer me enough info on that I 
can try to do write a patch for that.
So we got the Broadcom PCI b44 NIC driver (as card, as onboard device)
and we got additionally what please as a new extension??
Just two or three examples would do it!
Above that perhaps the dependencies could be a bit more precise:
Wouldn't you get confused if you deselcted the PCI or Ethernet option, but 
still retaining the same b44 driver selected as module with the identical 
help text?
Is that so hard to understand?

Yes, sure! But the help text is very unlucky and humble, and it is not clear 
enough in the sense of being distinctive enough, just clear and 
comprehensive.

Yes! But you need to EXPLAIN that "bus-glue" in the Kconfig help text in some 
two or three sentences. That shouldn't be that hard, should it?
And that is exactly the basic function of a Kconfig help text: To explain 
kernel compilation choices to users!
It is very very easy to simply ignore that fact and then, afterwards, call all 
people dumb who are not "omniscient" at all to see the differences through.
Where should they know from if they are not identical with your personality?
Cheers
Uwe
