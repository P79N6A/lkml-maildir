I fail to see the point.
man statfs says -1 is correct. What does the spec say?
I don't _care_ what GNU df thinks - this is a fairly minor change, and if we
don't manage to stick to the docs here because a userland tool gets confused,
how can we ever expect to get a bigger fix done, if it "breaks" userland?
