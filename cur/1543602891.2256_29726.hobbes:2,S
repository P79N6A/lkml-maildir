But could he decide that for the code of one of the other
few-hundred copyright holders in the kernel ?
Note that even if Linus says he thinks something is ok,
people would still need to respect the rights of all the
other copyright holders to the kernel.
Interesting thing is that Richard Stallman never seemed
willing to take this leap and trust the GPL, but instead
requires people to sign over their copyright to the FSF
before code is accepted into a GNU project ;))
cheers,
Rik
