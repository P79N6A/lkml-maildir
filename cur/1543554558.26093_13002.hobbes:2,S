Yes, it is. But unfortunately I cannot apply your patch. A --dry-run
gave no errors, but when I really patched 2.4.0-test10, it came to
some weird error message (patch tells me, that some files are
already patched???). [Why not 2.4.0-test11p2? I use this machine
for some numerical calculations which take long time runs and
they are at the moment not restartable after a break. For this reasons
I do not prefer pre-kernels (but I use the 2.4.0-beta series because
it is more stable for my hardware than the 2.2-series).]
