I'd imagine shared futexes would be much less common than private for
threaded programs... I'd say we should reevaluate things once we have
private futexes, and malloc/free stop hammering mmap_sem so hard...

For shared futexes, wouldn't i_mapping be worse, because you'd be
ping-ponging the tree_lock between processes, rather than have each
use their own mmap_sem?
That also only helps for the wakeup case too, doesn't it? You have
to use the vmas to find out which inode to use to do the wait, I think?
(unless you introduce a new shared futex API).
