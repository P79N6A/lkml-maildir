Nope. If the underlying block device is read-only then mounting the
filesystem will fail. I tried to fix this some time ago, and have a
set of patches that almost always work, but "almost always" isn't good
enough. Unfortunately I never managed to figure out a way to finish it
off without disgusting hacks or major surgery.
