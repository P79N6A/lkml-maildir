Well... flush_old_exec() calls flush_signal_handlers(force_default = 0),
this is not enough. We don't want to start user-space application with
SIGKILL ignored (yes, parent doesn't ignores it currently).

Thanks! What I can't understand is why kthread/daemonize block all signals.
This doesn't look good to me. This can't prevent signal delivery, this only
blocks signal_wake_up(). We can even set SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT for the kernel
thread. Of course, only root can do that, but isn't it better to just ignore
all signals instead of blocking them?
Note that we can't free the memory if we send a signal to (for example)
khelper.
Oleg.
