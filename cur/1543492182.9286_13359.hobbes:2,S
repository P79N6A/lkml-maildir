10%, or even 28%, isn't enough to claim "principle" developer in my book.
Major contributor, maybe even largest contributor, but principle implies
a majority, at least in my mind.
And lines of code are not the only measure.  Right now, what is propelling
Linux into the general market are in fact the server applications:
sendmail, bind, Apache, etc; not the user-land tools (including the ones
I've worked on). A good case could be made that these are the "killer
apps" of the Linux market.

Does the fact that gcc is often used as the compiler of the X Window
System on many platforms mean that I should claim that gcc is part
of the X project? I think not...  These tools, the GNU tools included,
are used in many other environments on their own for their own merits,
but Solaris, or Digital UNIX, don't claim that since they adopted these
tools they should be credited with them.
Apache, sendmail, bind, the X window system, etc, the list is too long 
to name, have a strong life external to GNU, are parts of many other systems 
(Solaris, Digital UNIX, HP/UX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, even Windows) used by 
millions of of people; that does not make them parts of those other systems.
Likewise, because you have found a tool useful to your ends, claiming that
X, or Apache, or Sendmail, or Bind is part of the GNU project, and therefore
GNU should be credited, is similarly specious.
This claim that "X is part of GNU", with the implied corallary that GNU should 
be given credit for other tools or for X, is what is divisive to the community.  
Give credit where credit is due, be generous to others for their 
contributions.  Even implying that GNU should be given credit for work 
done by other projects is the way to divide, rather than grow, the community 
developing free software.

And one could say that Linux, and many other systems have incorporated
TeX, the X Window System, with equal validity.  Why does this mean that
Linux should be called GNU/Linux.  The geneology of these tools are completely
independent of the GNU project.

"no one else did"?  Seems to me that the FreeBSD and NetBSD folks have
equal claim to such a goal.  They may not have marketed themselves that
way, but it is certainly the case.
And others, in the FreeBSD and NetBSD projects did their part as well;
along with folks at Berkeley who bothered to free up as much non-AT&T
derived code as possible did theirs. I don't think you can claim that
what has resulted as Linux is exclusively due to the GNU project, large
though the contributions have been.
And much of the resulting system has extensive documentation, built
by the contributors.  I care not to think about the sweat and blood I've
put on on my parts, nor the work that my company added in terms of
technical writing on the project...

No, I don't think most people who build free software forget that your
goal was to create an entire system.

Along with the idealism of many other people, in many other projects:
	BSD, Apache, the X Window System, Perl, TK/Tcl, etc.
You do NOT have a monopoly on idealism.  Many of us (maybe most) may disagree 
with your methods, but agree with the goals.

"The only way"?  I think not.  Idealism is very useful; but not all have
your ideals.  They often have their own ideals, as valid as yours.  For
example, I drafted the original X copyright: my ideal of "free software"
is that others can use it for anything they like, including making money
to support their families.  Are my ideals any worse or better than yours?
I think not.  One must view things in what aims are to be achieved, and
how the world may be made a better place.
At this date, people call the aggreate "Linux"; it is long since too late 
to attempt any change. 
Richard, I am not trying to diminish your accomplishments: we are all well
aware of them, and use tools that you wrote or the GNU project has
written every day.  You will NOT be forgotten.  But you are damaging yourself
and your project's reputation everytime you overstate your contributions
or understate other's contributions.
So when you say GNU/Linux, sir, you have my opposition, not my support. 
I believe this is dividing the community, not uniteing it. Be generous 
with your credit to others, and not crediting yourself with others 
contributions.
At this point, I've stated my position as clearly as I know how, and
do not intend to discuss this further.
