You don't even need to do that.  Just configure SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS
and SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS appropriately for your system.  There's
absolutely no need to build any of the additional modules.

I dropped support for the shared interrupt vector - having multiple
different ISRs depending on the way the wind was blowing was extremely
complex, and in this day and age of GHz CPUs rather silly.
The serial driver can still share interrupts just fine.  Just omit
configuring the multiport address and masks.
