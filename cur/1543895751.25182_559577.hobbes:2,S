The goal is to get all patches for a maintained subsystem submitted to 
Linus by the maintainer.

The -mm kernel already implements what your proposed PTS would do.
Plus it gives testers more or less all patches currently pending 
inclusion into Linus' tree in one kernel they can test.
The problem are more social problems like patches Andrew has never heard 
of before getting into Linus' tree during the merge window.

The problem is that most problems don't occur on one well-defined 
kind of hardware - patches often break in exactly the areas the patch
author expected no problems in.
And in many cases a patch for a device driver was written due to a bug 
report - in such cases a tester with the hardware in question is already 
available.

"useless pet"?
Be serious.
How many open source projects use Bugzilla and how many use the Debian BTS?
And then start thinking about why the "useless pet" has so many more 
user...
The Debian BTS requires you to either write emails with control messages 
or generating control messages with external tools.
In Bugzilla the same works through a web interface.
I know both the Debian BTS and Bugzilla and although they are quite 
different they both are reasonable tools for their purpose.
