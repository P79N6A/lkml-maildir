In certain situations, it's possible for one of the jump labels in
drivers/net/ppp_generic.c to get mangled by a macro, causing a failure
in compilation. The following patch ameliorates this somewhat:
diff -r -N linux/drivers/net/ppp_generic.c linux.wli/drivers/net/ppp_generic.c
2345c2345
< 		goto outw;
---
> 		goto ppp_outw;
2364c2364
<  outw:
---
>  ppp_outw:
Many of the jump labels therein also appear nameclash prone; I'm
tempted to prefix them all with "ppp_". If this is only a symptom of a
deeper problem, and should not be done, my apologies for the bandwidth.
Cheers,
Bill
