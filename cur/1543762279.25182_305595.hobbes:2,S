Hmm, makes sense, but this is to benchmark well... I remember from early 
discussions on 2.6 scheduler that using sched_yield might decrease 
performance (IIRC starve the calling application).
Also, that call should be put inside the idle loop, not for cpu_relax, which 
is very different, since it is used (for instance) in kernel/spinlock.c for 
spinlocks, and in such things. The "Pause" opcode is explicitly recommended 
(by Intel manuals, I don't recall why) for things like spinlock loops, and 
using yield there would be bad.
