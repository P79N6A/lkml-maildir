No, taskfile did nothing.
here's all i can see on my screen when executing a suspend I had to type
it up by hand so, hopefully no mistakes. 
I have the preempt patch and lock break patch included too. Since it had
no problem in WOLK and since it really does bring latency down to the
AA's low latency patches (since AC uses rmap I cant use those patches).
