A not to stupid disk would implement the seek to block 5
as waiting for block 4 to move past.  So
rewriting block 4 probably wouldn't help.  could be 
interesting to see a benchmark for that though, perhaps
some drives are really dumb.
The average "half rotation delay" when seeking does not apply
when the seek _isn't_ random.
