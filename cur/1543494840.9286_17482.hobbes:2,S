     tp->snd_ssthresh = max(min(tp->snd_wnd, tp->snd_cwnd) >> 1, 2);
 ...
   So as the tp->snd_wnd value is not in the right unit, maybe
   max(tp->snd_cwnd >> 1, 2)
   would be sufficient, waiting for a better solution.
No, that was the original bug I was trying to fix with the first line.
The fix is to divide tp->snd_wnd by the current connection mss.
