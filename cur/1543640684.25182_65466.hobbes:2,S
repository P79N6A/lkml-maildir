Hi,
The subject basically says it all .. I want to turn off kernel logging 
of preempt, but I see no option in kernel config.  It is all over my 
dmesg and various logs, and I fear it is slowing my system's 
responsiveness. Any ideas? ex.:
mozilla[11409] exited with preempt_count 2
mozilla-bin[18289] exited with preempt_count 3
mozilla-bin[1531] exited with preempt_count 1
netstat[28025] exited with preempt_count 3
xmms[19505] exited with preempt_count 1
Thanks a lot!
