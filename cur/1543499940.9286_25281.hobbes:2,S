	I patched /usr/src/linux/include/linux/lp.h so the #ifdef __KERNEL__ does
	not hide all the status variables that lpstat needs.
Hmm. This sounds like a topic that came up and was answered
less than three days ago.
(But that time it involved tunelp. There is no lpstat in util-linux.
The answer given was that util-linux-2.9s has a private lp.h
so that the contents of <linux/lp.h> no longer matter.)
