What about complaining when you parse a definition of an option that
was read before ? Or, if complaining is too hard/boring to add (e.g.
to Configure or xconfig), just declare it illegal and let the
linux-kernel police take care of flaming any offenders ;-)

Hmm, how do you define "menu" ? If you mean the structure of the
representation, I'd disagree, e.g.
"Peripheral buses"
  bool CONFIG_ISA
  bool CONFIG_PCI
  bool CONFIG_EISA
  ...
"Network drivers"
  if CONFIG_PCI ...
Looks valid and useful to me. Now, if you mean the conditional
structure, a typical counter-example could be:
if CONFIG_PCMCIA
  bool CONFIG_CARDBUS
...
... somewhere deep in the network drivers ...
    if CONFIG_CARDBUS
      bool CONFIG_SOME_CARDBUS_ONLY_CARD
But maybe you mean something else ?
I think as a first step, requiring things to be compatible with
sequential evaluation is necessary, because Configure can't handle
backward references anyway. Further requirements or guidelines could
be built on top of this.

Oh, I see. Thanks for the clarification.

P.S. Evil idea of the day: while writing the above meta-code, I
     realized that  bool "text" CONFIG_xx  is in fact redundant,
     and  bool CONFIG_xxx  should be sufficient - if people write
     the corresponding Configure.help entry. Now wouldn't that be
     a great way to enforce good documentation habits ? ;-)
