Hrm, the more I look at things, the more I'm convinced that this is wrong: 
right now in the network code and other places we will use put_page() to 
release a reference to a potential page cache page which could cause the 
PageLRU BUG() to hit.  I'm sure there are lots of subtle cases like this 
all over the tree that the change in semantics has introduced bugs in.
