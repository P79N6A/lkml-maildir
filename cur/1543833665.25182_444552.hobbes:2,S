"There is one more advanced barrier function"?  ;-)  Or did you want to
remove set_mb()?
Plus, the "depending on the function" bit means "respectively".  So what
you really want as help is something like:
	This assigns the value to the variable and then inserts a
	barrier after the assignment.  It isn't guaranteed to insert
	anything more than a compiler barrier in a UP compilation.
