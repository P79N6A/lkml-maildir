Hello,
what will happen in the (IP) protocol layer of the kernel
if the NIC can not send the packet,
because the NIC is paused by the receiving station with Ethernet Flow
Control
PAUSE frames.
In other words, what are the consequences if netif_stop_queue is called
and netif_start_queue is not called for a noticeable time.
Cheers,
Martin Rauh
