Hmm, perhaps my eyes are just not as good as other peoples, but my X
runs at 1600x1200 and I have konsole in KDE configured so that when it
is maximized it is very close to a 80x25 window (actually it is 82x31
with a size 18 font).
Nice and readable, if I make the font any smaller to fit more
cols/rows then the text gets too small and my eyes hurt.
Reading kernel code formatted for 80cols fits perfectly for me.
