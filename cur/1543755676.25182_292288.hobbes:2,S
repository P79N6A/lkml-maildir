640K?

All that happens there is a one line change to vmlinux.lds.S  that
causes the kernel to live at a different physical and virtual
address.  So everything works as normal.
I do agree that it is risky to use the first 640K for normal work.
But on the list of things to fix it is a minor war, and even if we
back up that region of memory we don't need to use it.
There are still remain a lot of code reviews to ensure the code is
generally safe.
