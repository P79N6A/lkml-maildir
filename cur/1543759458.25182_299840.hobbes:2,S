[PATCH] PCI: Dynids - passing driver data
Currently, code exists in the pci layer to allow userspace to specify
driver data when adding a pci dynamic id from sysfs. However, this data
is never used and there exists no way in the existing code to use it.
This patch allows device drivers to indicate that they want driver data
passed to them on dynamic id adds by initializing use_driver_data in their
pci_driver->pci_dynids struct. The documentation has also been updated
to reflect this.

 When the driver exits, it just calls pci_unregister_driver() and the PCI layer
 automatically calls the remove hook for all devices handled by the driver.
