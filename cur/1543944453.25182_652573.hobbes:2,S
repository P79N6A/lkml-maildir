If a person does a driver API change and does all the work to sweep
the entire tree updating all the drivers, doesn't it penalize that
person a bit much to stick a new driver in front of that work?
People write code on top of infrastructure, both new and old, not the
other way around.  At least to me, that seems how the merging ought to
work too.
