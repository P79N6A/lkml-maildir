However, I think ank is at least partially correct: TCP_NOPUSH has some
magic behaviour for sockets in listen state, and turns on at least some
T/TCP semantics, if I remember correctly. Tony?
If I remember correctly, may I suggest something: make a new BSD option
called (ehh, just random name ;) TCP_CORK, and make the old BSD
TCP_NOPUSH option be a superset of TCP_CORK that also turns on T/TCP on
listen sockets.
Linux TCP_CORK doesn't have anything to do with T/TCP (not surprisingly,
as T/TCP is considered a broken protocol in Linux and other circles).
And Linux TCP_CORK _is_ used on listen sockets: it makes sockets that
are accepted from the listen socket have the corking semantics. In
contrast, BSD TCP_NOPUSH, I think, has this overloading issue..
