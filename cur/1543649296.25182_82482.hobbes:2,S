Ok as promised kexec-tools-1.3.tar.gz is released.
The new test case it provides is
kexec -debug bzImage
The serial console must be initialized before using this.
[root@p4dp8-0 root]# kexec -debug bzImage-2.4.17.eb-amd768-eepro100-kexec-apic-lb-mtd2 ip=dhcp root=/dev/nfs console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600 reboot=hard panic=5 ide0=ata66 verbose

I have a very strange node that makes it all of the way to 'j' before rebooting.
The concept that something is dying in protected mode will all of the interrupts
disabled is so novel that I really don't know what to make of it, yet.
But I would be very interested if other people had similar experiences.
