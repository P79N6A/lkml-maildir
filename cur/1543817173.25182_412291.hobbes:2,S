I don't know why the messages are mangled - it looks like there's some
problem with serial console (might be x86_64-specific).
But the messages you're seeing are due to some debug code, sorry - they
didn't happen on my test box.  You'll need to change report_lost_ticks
(arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c, line 66) to zero.
