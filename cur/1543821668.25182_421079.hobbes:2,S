The assumption I'm making is that if you don't use XIP that NAND
becomes an economically attractive and technically feasible option to
store the code.  The idea was to dive into the tradeoffs of the
options.  It reflects what I believe is the reality of what design
decisions are being looked at by customers of my current employer.
Comparing apples and oranges is appropriate when one is investigating
spherical fruits :)
