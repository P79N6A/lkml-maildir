Could you send me your local patches?  (I use parport in polling mode.)

Actually, these PCI vendor:device IDs are not specific to any card,
they are hardwired inside the NM9835 chip.  My no-name cards (made in
China) have an empty place instead of the the configuration EEPROM.

Would be nice to know exactly what these issues are.  My only issue with
these cards so far is that I have to patch the kernel to use them...
Thanks,
