I thought it was unimplemented. Even so, it is at least one
extra round trip to/from the kernel. (I'd guess trips>1)

The syscall exit path itself need not be polluted. Changes to
recalc_sigpending and do_signal would get the job done.
For the former, either add an extra word of kernel-internal
signal data or just check a simple flag. For do_signal, maybe
add an extra "if(foo)" at the top of the main loop. (that would
depend on what was done to recalc_sigpending)
I suppose the goodness or badness of this depends partly on how
much you are willing to pay for pthreads that are fast and correct.
People around here seem to like burying their heads in hope that
pthreads will just go away, while app developers stubbornly try to
use the API.
