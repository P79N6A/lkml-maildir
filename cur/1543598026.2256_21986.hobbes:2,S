I have checked again the patches and they allow a lot of drivers to feed 
the entropy pool that otherwise wouldn't had ever contributed to it. Thus 
it changes things and opens the question about the effects on entropy 
estimate. See the figures, three (3) nics to date reference SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM.
As the fact that 2.4 is supposed to be a stable serie, I assume it's
irrelevant.
