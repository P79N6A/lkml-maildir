Thanks for the reply. You're right. It doesn't help at all :)
Well, actually it does.
It reminds me why I started working on this in the first place. It wasn't 
because I wanted to be a big shot kernel developer or the like, or have my 
name in the kernel credits. It was because I wanted to use the code.
So, given that I'm perfectly willing to send Pavel patches, but he's not 
willing to take them, I guess I the best thing I can do is to just let Pavel 
have his way, give up on the concept of merging Suspend2 and maintain it out 
of tree. When Pavel and Rafael get swsusp up to scratch, I can stop doing 
that and just use their version.
Well, that's what I think at the moment. Let's see how things progress.
Nigel
