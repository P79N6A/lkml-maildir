You can fix this with the kernel parameter nolapic_timer as Cal reported 
earlier that working right, or try Andi's patch to automagically mark the 
lapic as bad.  This should work fine with ACPI.
The BIOS is at fault but Andi's patch just works around the BIOS' 
incompleteness and has been successful for two other people.
