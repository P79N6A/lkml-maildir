I don't know how this particular scheduler fail, but the problem
exists for any real-time system.  Nobody can run "N+1" guaranteed 
low-latency
tasks where N is the max, that is obvious.
A generic os scheduler can run almost any amount of tasks, with latencies
proportional to the amount of tasks.
A good RT scheduler won't even _try_ to run "N+1" RT tasks.  The
last task will either fail to start, or fail the attempt to
increase its priority into RT.  You may then kill (or un-prioritize)
some other RT task and try again.
