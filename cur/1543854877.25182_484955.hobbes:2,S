Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c(539): remark #593: variable "ret" was set but 
never used
The source code is
    int ret;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
