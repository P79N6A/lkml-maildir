  we have several systems where e100 produces netdev watchdog errors,
  while eepro100 works without problems.  I can understand the desire
  to migrate, but what timeframe are we looking at?  roughly
  translated, when do I _have_ to start help debugging the e100
  driver?  ;-)
  I can do another attempt at rolling out the e100 driver, see what
  breaks, and try to report it around 2.6.1[01] or something like that
  if that helps?
