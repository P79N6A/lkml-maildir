I dont understand you here. Suppose fdatasync() is "do not return until
all cached writes to this file *done by current process* hit the disk
(i.e. cached write data from other concurrent processes is not waited for),
report succes or error code". Then
write(fd_O_DIRECT, buf, sz) - will wait until buf's data hit the disk
write(fd, buf, sz) - potentially will return sooner, but
fdatasync(fd) - will wait until buf's data hit the disk
Looks same to me.

You mean "You can use aio_write" ?
