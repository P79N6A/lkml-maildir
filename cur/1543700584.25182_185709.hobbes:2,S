Well its the same problem. A nice -20 process can still lose 40-55% of its
performance to a nice 19 process, a figure of 10% is probably too high and
we'd really want it <= 5% like what happens with a single logical processor.

It will be based on dynamic priorities, possibly with some feedback from
nice as well, but it probably still won't be perfect and it will probably
be very complex *cough* hardware priorities *cough* ;)
I might try to fit it into a more general priority balancing system because
we currently have similar sorts of failings on regular SMP as well.
