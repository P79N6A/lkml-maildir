From Page 153, "The BIOS COMPANION" ISBN 188967120-7
"The AGP Aperture Size is the amount of system memory for the
AGP card, so host cycles hitting that area are forwarded to that
card without translation..."
This may be causing confusion because it really should read
"amount of system address space". Too many writers interchange
the word "memory" for "address space".
No graphics cards, on their own, or with their own BIOS, use any
"system memory". They can't. They don't "own" any. Of course, when
you run X, X will own some system memory that it allocated via mmap(),
and it uses it in conjunction with your AGP card. The internal RAM
within the AGP card is the only RAM in "owns". This is accessible
to the CPU as well as the card electronics. The address range through
which the CPU can access this high-speed RAM is called the Graphics
Aperture and/or the AGP Aperture.
This is the same thing as (page 139), "VGA Frame Buffer Size"
for the older PCI/VGA boards.
So, if you set your AGP aperture size to overlap address-space where
memory exists, you will probably see streaking and flashing (snow) on
the screen. The bus-contention will also slow your machine during
RAM access and may even cause data corruption in RAM. In other words,
if you have 32 MB of RAM in your screen-card, set the aperture size
to 32 MB, not (!) 256 MB.
