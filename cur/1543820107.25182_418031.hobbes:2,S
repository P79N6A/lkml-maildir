Unless I completely misunderstand something, one of the main points of
the netchannels if to have *zero* fields written to by both producer
and consumer.  Receiving and sending a lot can be expected to be the
common case, so taking a performance hit in this case is hardly a good
idea.
I haven't looked at Davem's implementation at all, but Van simply
seperated fields in consumer-written and producer-written, with proper
alignment between them.  Some consumer-written fields are also read by
the producer and vice versa.  But none of this results in cacheline
pingpong.
If your description of the problem is correct, it should only mean
that the implementation has a problem, not the concept.
