I've put this driver on my web page at :
http://phaedra.apana.org.au/johna
But, my original comments ommitted the fact that there is a data in
pin, as well as a data out pin. The code itself is fine, and reflects
this.
The correct pin allocations are :
port 0x278
bit 0, pin 2, Clock
bit 1, pin 3, Chip Select
bit 2, pin 4, Data out to ADC
bits 3-7 user available
port 0x279
bit 3, pin 15, Busy
bit 4, pin 13, Data in from ADC
bits 5-7 user available
And I've changed the code on my home page to reflect this.
Gatic,
