Sounds good. I would try to track that for x86-64 too then when
possible to make the later x86-64 merge easier.

Hmm, I would prefer to do that during the merge. I'm not sure there
will be that much push afterwards to unify stuff, and then we might
be stuck with an inferior setup.
I don't think it makes much difference for review if the previous
code is in mainline or not.
