It all depends on the workload but thread switching overhead can be
negligible - after all all it does is entering kernel, schedule, swap
processor context and return.  Maybe using separate stack has minor
impact on cache hit ratio.  You need benchmark numbers to claim one way
or the other.
In my experience with web caches, epoll or similar for idle clients and
thread per active client scaled and performed pretty well - it needed
more memory but the performance wasn't worse than asynchronous design
and doing complex server in async model is a lot of pain.
