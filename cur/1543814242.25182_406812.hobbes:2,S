Hi all,
I have managed to measure the cpu time in nanoseconds. On i386 I have used
the monotonic_clock() to measure the cpu time accurately.
The cpu time measurements were based on t->sched_info.cpu_time, but
instead of accumulate
the all cpu time, I needed just the diff=jiffies
-t->sched_info.last_arrival in the sched_info_depart().
The problem was most of time the diff was zero. So to solve this
problem I used the monotonic_clock() function that provides more accurate
way to measure cpu time.
Any comments?

I have checked it. It helped me to reach the monotonic_clock()
function after hacking the code.

I am using the relayfs to report the information I need among the
processors. I just put some klog in some key points in the code.
