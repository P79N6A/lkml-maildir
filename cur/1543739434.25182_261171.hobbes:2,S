they are informational, if you are evaluating latencies. Feel free to
post larger latencies. Right now the threshold for "large" depends - on
a fast box i'd say latencies above 200 usecs are worth reporting - but
any trace can be interesting. Latencies above 1000 usecs are definitely
worth seeing.
stability has the highest priority at the moment, and the other type of
non-latency stackdumps (scheduling while atomic, smp_processor_id()
warnings or outright kernel oopses) should always be reported if
possible.
