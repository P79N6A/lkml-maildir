Hmm, I think that smc_phy_configure() is only called from
smc_drv_resume() and smc_timeout() (via the workqueue).
For smc_drv_resume() I expected that there would be some sort of mutual
exclusion in the generic layers to prevent _close() and _resume() from
happening at the same time.
For smc_timeout() I would also expect that the generic layer would have
cancelled the tx_timeout etc before calling smc_close().
I guess I don't know if either of these things are true -- anyone know?
The other solution might be to set phy_type to 0 in smc_phy_powerdown()
and then redetect it in smc_open() and smc_resume(). Or just use another
flag altogether.
Ian.
