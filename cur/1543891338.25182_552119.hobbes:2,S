You could not declare in advance a structure that would contain pointers
to every load immediate instruction of the optimized cond_calls. Unless
I'm wrong, this idea just can't be implemented in C.

I understand that if we limit ourselves to applications like the two
toy examples I proposed (enabling profiling and bug fixups), it could
make sense to try to declare a variable somewhere and later use it in
the body of functions (except the fact that it cannot work, due to
incapacity to declare pointers to each load immediate instruction, as
stated above). Even if it would work, the main purpose here is to
support the Linux Kernel Markers, where the goal is to provide the
ability to declare a marker within the body of a function without
requiring more hassle than a printk, but with less performance impact
than the latter. Also, we would not want the whole kernel to recompile
simply because someone chose to add one or two marker in his own driver
to extract some more information and had to add them to some globally
included header file.
Therefore, due to the use of cond_calls within markers, I strongly
prefer the dynamic implementation I proposed to implementations
requiring additional variable declaration and frequent header changes.
