   There _are_ standard Linux OS services dealing with the mouse,
but _not_ in the kernel. They are in libgpm.

   Agreed. I and Vojtech Pavlik are currently working on a better
code.

   No way, they just link with libgpm.

   Why? Even the version of libc you use is not in _all_ distributions.
This is exactly why almost every distribution has a system of dependencies
which allows packages to specify what optional packages they need.
				Have a nice fortnight
