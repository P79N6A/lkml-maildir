I agree 100%.  However - in this *particular* case, it is only to
keep a dumb snoop out of private information.  Not to keep a
skilled hacker out.  Script kiddie hacking, and password snooping
is not going to happen here - it isn't that big of a deal.  Only
a simple solution is needed for this particular case.

Well, I'm sure from suggestions from others that an acceptable
solution is possible for my limited case, but definitely not a
"Pentagon" style solution.  This is a simple solution in need of
a "windows 95 passwords" style solution.  Something simple, that
keeps undetermined people out.
