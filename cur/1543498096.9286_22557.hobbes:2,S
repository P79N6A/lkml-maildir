HOWTO-framebuffer-1.0 is out!!! 
You can peruse the HOWTO at
	
http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html
These files are also available from the same place:
	HOWTO-framebuffer-1.0.html.tar.gz

Enjoy, and _please_ _please_ _please_ mail me privately if you wish to
discuss issues with the HOWTO, we don't want to pollute the l-k mailing

Changes:
* Moved 'Setting up X11 FBdev' into its own section
* Moved to 1.0 release from 1.0pre7 (Got bored!)
Distributors, HOWTO list maintainers, feel free to take copies and put on
CDs or web sites. 
Next releases will add new sections on changes in 2.3.x & 2.2.x kernels. 
Cheers,
Alex
