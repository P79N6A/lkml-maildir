How significant is this vma size issue?
anon_vma objrmap will add 20 bytes to each vma (on 32-bit arches):
8 for prio_tree, 12 for anon_vma linkage in vma,
sometimes another 12 for the anon_vma head itself.
anonmm objrmap adds just the 8 bytes for prio_tree,
remaining overhead 28 bytes per mm.
Seems hard on Andi to begrudge him 4.
