Excuse me for barging in. But.
with latest xorg, xlib will be using xcb internally, which afaik should
help matters a little, but furthermore, with the arrival of xcb, stuff
are bound to change somewhat fast, and with abit more incentive(as in,
real benefit on latest kernels), they are bound to change even faster.
and if people upgrading to newest X(using xlib w/xcb) and applications
being updated can help stuff out in the kernel, i'd say its best to push
for that.
