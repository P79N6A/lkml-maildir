| The driver is working great for 2.4.x Linux and is modified to reflect all SCSI layer change in 2.5.72.  I have RH9.0 and installed 2.5.72 on the same system.  Driver compiled under 2.5.72 OK.  The module utilities are upgraded to 0.9.13-pre.

| Now first problem I have is to module loading fails on "insmod mymodule.o".  Message:
| 
| "No module found in object"
| "Error inserting 'mymodule.o': -1 Invalid module format"
...

| It looks like something is missing from migrating my driver module from 2.4.x to 2.5.x.
| 
| What is new requirement for module building and loading with "insmod" on 2.5.72 compare with the requirement in 2.4.x?  
Please use the correct makefile for mymodule.
See linux/Documentation/modules.txt and
  linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefile.txt.
In general, it only takes a few lines to build a module that is
maintained outside of the kernel source tree in 2.5/2.6.
Here is an example of one that is probably longer than it needs
to be:
# makefile for oops_test/dump*.c
# Randy Dunlap, 2003-03-12
# usage:
# cd /path/to/kernel/source && make SUBDIRS=/path/to/source/oops_test/ modules
CONFIG_OOPS_TEST=m
obj-m := dump_test.o
# dump_test-objs := dump_test.o
clean-files := *.o
# fini;
