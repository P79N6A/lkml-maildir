Thanks from the "other developer". What I would like to have is a function 
that gives me the next (or even a random) available number from my range. 
Currently I have to do it on my own AFAICS. 
Nevertheless, I ported my driver to the new interface. I see it cdev_add() 
succeeding, but the device never shows up in sysfs. Do I have to do any more 
tricks with class devices and stuff?
While I was sneaking around in the code I found this drivers/char/tty_io:3093
        cdev_init(&driver->cdev, &tty_fops);
        driver->cdev.owner = driver->owner;
        error = cdev_add(&driver->cdev, dev, driver->num);
        if (error) {
                cdev_del(&driver->cdev);
Isn't the call to cdev_del() just wrong here?
