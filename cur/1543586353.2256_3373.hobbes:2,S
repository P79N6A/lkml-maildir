Hm. But comment in linux/skbuff.h says:
        /*
         * This is the control buffer. It is free to use for every
         * layer. Please put your private variables there. If you
         * want to keep them across layers you have to do a skb_clone()
         * first. This is owned by whoever has the skb queued ATM.
         */
Which does not imply I should clear buffer after I am passing ownership.

Why not document it somewhere, so that others will not fall into the same trap?
