     { PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_845_G_0,
                  PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,
                  INTEL_I845_G,
                  "Intel",
                  "i845G",
                  intel_830mp_setup },
Surely this is wrong or ?
Should be "intel_845_setup", I think.
Which might explain funny messages in th X/DRI/DRM log.
For info, the Intel M/B D845PESV(L) reports as a "G" -
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82845G/GL [Brookdale-G] Chipset Host 
Bridge (rev 02)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82845G/GL [Brookdale-G] Chipset AGP Bridge 
(rev 02)
Also in drivers/char/drm/drm_agpsupport.h, the switch statement at 262 is 
missing the
cases for INTEL_I830_M, INTEL_I845_G.
