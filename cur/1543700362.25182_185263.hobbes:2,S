Ok, the results are in. Running up to three yield-loops doesn't degrade
gnomemeeting. Running one non-yield loop does degrade gnomemeeting
_very_ slightly. Adding a second non-yield loop has approximately the
same stuttering effect as a kernel compile. Adding a third non-yield
loop makes gnomemeeting totally unusable.
All these tests were done with Nick's scheduler patch. If I should retry
with stock 2.6.0 just tell me.
Sound driver is by the way snd_es1968 in ALSA and maestro in OSS.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
