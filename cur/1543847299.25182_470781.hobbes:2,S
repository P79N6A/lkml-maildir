AFAIK, strictly speaking this is not a regression, but rather a new feature 
breaking: MSI capability of snd-hda-intel. Alsa dev  
Takashi Iwai doesn't think it is snd-hda-intel doing something wrong, but 
rather an IRQ routing probem. As such I am not sure who to cc....
While I don't really understand the details, I guess it is due to snd and net 
sharing the interrupt in "pure" APIC more:
 23:     232796          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi  HDA Intel, eth0
So both are physically on the same INT line? But MSI of snd want to assign 
another IRQ to itself:
 23:       7486          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi  eth0
316:          0          0   PCI-MSI-edge     HDA Intel
So it seems that irq23 still receives signals from snd and thus the nobody 
cared message gets printed.
Thus my work-around is simply to disable MSI of snd by 
snd-hda-intel.disable_msi=1 and all is well again.
So if this cannot be fixed for 2.6.19, I humbly suggest deactivating MSI of 
snd-intel-hda by default.
Cheers,
