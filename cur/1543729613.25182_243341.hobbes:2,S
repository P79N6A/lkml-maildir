Seems I'm in a minority, and certainly beyond my expertise,
but I'm very suspicious of this.  Though I see mtd_blktrans_thread
already does the same.  I bet it'll fix problems in some workloads,
and it's a very easy change to make, but I doubt it's right.
PF_MEMALLOC entitles the thread to dip into emergency memory reserves
(and stops it from descending into try_to_free_pages: that may be okay,
though Oliver notes that allocations from here ought to be GFP_NOIO,
that's more appropriate).
Fine for it to dip into those reserves when acting on behalf of something
already PF_MEMALLOC (i.e. try_to_free_pages itself), but not fine for it
to do so as a matter of course e.g. worst case, doing readahead could
easily exhaust reserves.  Or, is this thread only used for writing?
that wouldn't be so bad if so.
I'd have thought the right 2.6 answer would be for it to have mempools
for whatever it might need to get the I/O done; but I haven't a clue
in this area, can easily believe that would difficult to implement.
Or would it solve the problem at hand, if it made itself PF_MEMALLOC
just while servicing a request from a PF_MEMALLOC?
