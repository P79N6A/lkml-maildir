Now, let's see.  When this error happens, it can be one of these:
    1a) the script itself is broken (eg, it has `#!/bin/bash\r')
    1b) the interpreter is missing, (eg, the script has
        `#!/usr/bin/perl', while perl got removed during the
        grand perl repackaging)
    2)  the interpreter is broken, (eg, missing shared library)
    3)  the script does not exist
In any case, the heart of the problems 1) and 2) is expressed by the
fact that there's something fishy with #!INTERPRETER.  In the case of
1a, the script should be fixed, in case 1b, the system should be
fixed, but this doesn't really matter.  Either way: INTERPRETER is the
file the kernel is talking about when it says ENOENT.  Only in case 3),
the ENOENT is about the script itself.
It seems reasonable, and helpful, for bash to print the name of the
INTERPRETER.

Well, this doesn't mean very much, other than you happen to experience
2) most (and you're fast at identifying the strange error).  But even
in this case, the name of the broken interpreter is what you should be
warned about.  Maybe others usually experience 1b), who cares?
In this third incarnation of my patch (today really isn't my day), you
see these messages for 1-3:
1)
    $ cat /bin/foo.sh 
    #!/foo/bar/baz
    echo bar
    $ /bin/bash -c /bin/foo.sh 
    /bin/bash: /bin/foo.sh: No such file or directory
    $ ./new/bash -c /bin/foo.sh 
    ./new/bash: /bin/foo.sh: /foo/bar/baz: No such file or directory
2)
    $ cat /bin/no-ld.sh 
    #!/usr/bin/urg
    $ ldd /bin/urg                
	    libkpathsea.so.3 => not found
            [..]
    $ /bin/bash -c /bin/no-ld.sh 
    /bin/bash: /bin/no-ld.sh: No such file or directory
    $ ./new/bash -c /bin/no-ld.sh 
    ./new/bash: /bin/no-ld.sh: /usr/bin/urg: No such file or directory
3)
    $ /bin/bash -c /bin/no-such-foo.sh
    /bin/bash: /bin/no-such-foo.sh: No such file or directory
    $ ./new/bash -c /bin/no-such-foo.sh
    ./new/bash: /bin/no-such-foo.sh: No such file or directory
Ok, here goes try #3:
