I fixed x86-64 get/put_user, although it doesn't matter much there because
it compiles with -fno-reorder-blocks by default. 
(generates smaller code and makes the assembly output much more readable)

My copy of 2.6.0test5 doesn't have a "direct_copy_to_user", so I'm wondering
at what tree you're looking.
And more importantly I think the i386 uaccess.h copy_{from/to}_user should 
be fixed to not do the access_ok()/memset check inline. It can be as well done
out of line. This would likely save some code size. Doing it inline
just doesn't make any sense.
[x86-64 does it this way]
