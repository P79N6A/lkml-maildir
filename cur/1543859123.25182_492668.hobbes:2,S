I looked at applying this one to agpgart.git, as it's less controversial
than the other patch. However,..
- MIME : just say no. I had to hand fix up a few things before git would
  even see that I was feeding it a diff.
- No Signed-off-by: line.
- The diff adds trailing whitespace. This makes git sad also.
  (This problem also affects the other diff, which is possibly why...)
- Finally..
   error: patch failed: drivers/char/agp/generic.c:1076
   error: drivers/char/agp/generic.c: patch does not apply
   error: patch failed: drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c:256
   error: drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c: patch does not apply
  Perhaps this diff should have have been [1/2] instead.
Can you fix those up, and resend this one?
The other diff I want to chew over some more before applying, especially
after Arjan's comments.
