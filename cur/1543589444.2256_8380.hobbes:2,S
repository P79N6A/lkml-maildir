Looking for the best way to give all users a common desktop, which comes from one source (for easy administration).
Found copying my /root/.gnome & .sawfish directories to a user home breaks the user's GUI, implying a symlink wouldn't work.  I am told .gnome & .sawfish can be copied to /etc/skel to give common look for new users, but need ongoing single-source control.  Besides, I tried copying root's config files to skel & it broke user GUIs.
Security is also a concern, so couldn't symlink into root anyway.
Symlinked root's panel file & folder to non-prived user's, but adding/removing an applet in root does not seem to affect the user's desktop.
Recommendations & resources welcomed, please.
