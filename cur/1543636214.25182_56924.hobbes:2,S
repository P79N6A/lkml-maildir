No.
Thread 2 doesn't manage the file descriptor table, the kernel does.
Whether the kernel may re-use the descriptor or not depends on whether
the descriptor is closed or not.  The kernel knows, but unless close()
behaves in a defined way, the application does not at this point.  Thus,
step 3 may either be required, forbidden, or undefined.
