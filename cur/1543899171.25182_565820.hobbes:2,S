But it _is_ about the freezer; see the "Remove process freezer" part.  
:-)  Since the freezer is used during hibernation, hibernation is a
legitimate topic.

Your short and simple list omits a few crucial items:
A)  Decide what to do about remote wakeup requests.
B)  Prevent I/O requests from resuming devices that have been 
suspended.
C)  Prevent devices and drivers from being registered or unregistered; 
in particular decide what to do about hot-plug or hot-unplug events.
D)  Block driver bind or unbind calls.
Any of these things is capable of screwing up the course of events.
(In fact A _should_ be allowed to abort a suspend.)

So what happens if a new subdevice arrives at the wrong time?  Do you 
block instead of binding it?  While holding a mutex needed to suspend 
the parent device?
What about drivers trying to bind to existing devices?
What happens to I/O requests submitted after the "no_io" flag is set?  
The driver will have to block them, effectively creating its own little 
"freezer".

This is a lot like what we already do.  The differences are:
	There is nothing corresponding to your "no-bind" flag.
	Most drivers don't have anything like your "no_io" flag;
	they assume that nobody will be around to submit an I/O
	request.

Nobody doubts that suspend can be made to work without the freezer.  
The point is that doing it this way dumps a bunch of extra 
responsibility on drivers.
