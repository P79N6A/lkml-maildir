this assumes that you don't just always want to assume and use SMP
primitives in a virtualized context. I sort of question that assumption;
sure these things have overhead, especially "lock", but if the solution
is more complexity and weird things to hide that half-percent or less of
performance difference... then do remember that such complexity is not
free either. Runtime tricks cost.
