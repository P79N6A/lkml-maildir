Write a program which sync writes to the same spot 50 times/sec 24/7 and
get back to me in two months or so if your ibm drive is still alive.
Thats 129,600,000 writes to the same sector on the disk each month.

Unfortunately they all (seagate, maxtor, etc) expect you to pay for
shipping so it could end up being a rather expensive experiment. Besides
the fact they die after 2 months not 2 weeks it could also be a very long
experiment.
