The mandatory alignment is applied anyways. You do not need to max() on 
that.
One could simply specify cache_line_size() with Pekka's patch. 
cache_line_size() could default to 0 if !SMP.

No slab allocator supports that right now. However, SLOB in the past has 
ignored the alignment in order to reduce memory use. So maybe Matt wants 
to introduce this?

No the slab allocators were optimized for VSMP so that the 
internode_alignment is not necessary there. That was actually one of the 
requirements that triggered the slab numa work.
