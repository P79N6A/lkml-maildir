Why is not a regression?
I'm busy enough with m68k as is just to catch up and you're not making it 
easier. Such repetitive task have a tendency to show up pretty high when I 
occasionally run an profile test run, e.g. a much simpler vertical blank 
interrupt at 50Hz is noticable. The new hrtimer code is much heavier and 
runs twice as much.
bye, Roman
