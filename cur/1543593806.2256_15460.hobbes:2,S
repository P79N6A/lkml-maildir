Thank Hollis. :-) As I've already said, I'm really no kernel hacker.
OTOH I've programmed a lot 5+ years ago, so I can understand some
things. I'm relieved also that you have replied, because seemed that you
had a disease or something - your contributions both to the list and
updates to the page stopped abruptly.

Actually, I decided on Netelligent Dual because of two things:
* I had the oportunity to get such a board by a reasonable price (US$
50.00); here in Brazil, it's rather difficult to get real multiport
adapters (what is available are hubs-on-a-board. Bleargh). The ones
available are Adaptec ones, and here they cost US$ 500.00 up. Too bad
because they have the 21x4x chip that works flawlessly on PPC. :-(
* I've read someplace that someone got to make TLAN work on PowerPC (no
links, please :-). He said also that MacOS would olympically ignore the
driver, but it would work on PPCLinux.
Even in US multiport Adaptec boards are not cheap; in eBay prices vary
from US$ 150 to US$ 225.

The adapter ROM must be enabled for the driver work? I'm asking this
because lspci -v shows that the adapter ROM in both ports is "disabled".

Could you the group membership issues on the site? I'd like to see the
bug reports but I can't do it. Check the site for the actual messages
without logging in.

Thanks also!
