| Ctrl-Rollen (or whatever the key is called on your keyboard) on the console,

Ctrl-ScrollLock on mine if I'm following you correctly.
Same as Sysrq-P if sysrq is enabled, except that the former
is always available.
Are there other similar functions that are available without
Sysrq enabled?  If so, where can I find info about them?
(other than drivers/char/keyboard.c :)
