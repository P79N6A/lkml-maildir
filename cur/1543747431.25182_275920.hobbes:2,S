cluster-pageout.patch that was sent together with
mark_page_accessed-batching.patch has roughly similar effect: page-out
is done in file order, ignoring local LRU order at end of the inactive
list. It did improve performance in page-out intensive micro-benchmark:
Averaged number of microseconds it takes to dirty 1GB of
16-times-larger-than-RAM ext3 file mmaped in 1GB chunks:
without-patch:   average:    74188417.156250
               deviation:    10538258.613280
   with-patch:   average:    69449001.583333
               deviation:    12621756.615280

I don't think that atomic_inc will be particularly
costly. generic_file_{write,read}() call find_get_page() just before
calling mark_page_accessed(), so cache-line with page reference counter
is most likely still exclusive owned by this CPU.
