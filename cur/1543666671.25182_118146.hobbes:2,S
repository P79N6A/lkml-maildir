    Not at all. 'select()' takes a *number of file descriptors* as
its first argument, meaning the maximum number of file descriptors to
check (it checks only the first N file descriptors, being 'N' the
first argument). Usually that first argument is FD_SETSIZE, but the
result of any function returning a number is right if you know that
the return value is what you want.
    If, for example, FD_SETSIZE is set to UINT_MAX but
getdtablesize() returns 100 ('ulimit' came to mind), it's a good idea
to use the return value of that function. Anyway, IMHO is better to
use FD_SETSIZE.
    See the glibc info for more references.
    Bye and happy coding :)
