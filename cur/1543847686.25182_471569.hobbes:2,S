Subject: [rfc] 2.6.19-rc1-git5: consolidation of file backed fault handlers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patchset is against 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 up to
numa-add-zone_to_nid-function-swap_prefetch.patch (ie. no readahead stuff,
which causes big rejects and would be much easier to fix in readahead
patches than here). Other than this feature, the -mm specific stuff is
pretty simple (mainly straightforward filesystem conversions).
Changes since last round:
- trimmed the cc list, no big changes since last time.
- fix the few buglets preventing it from actually booting
- reinstate filemap_nopage and filemap_populate, because they're exported
  symbols even though no longer used in the tree. Schedule for removal.
- initialise fault_data one field at a time (akpm)
- change prototype of ->fault so it takes a vma (hch)
Has passed an allyesconfig on G5, and booted and stress tested (on ext3
and tmpfs) on 2x P4 Xeon with my userspace tester (which I will send in
a reply to this email). (stress tests run with the set_page_dirty_buffers
fix that is upstream).
Please apply.
Nick
