	I've tried posting to the Cipe list about this, but it seems I'm
the only one listening there anymore. I'm not sure where to go next, but
I'm in a pickle and need to get Cipe working properly on 2.2.1 and RedHat
5.2.
Cipe compiles and installs fine. The module loads without complaint, but
when I attempt to run ciped, I get the following in my logs.
Feb 16 15:59:00 nooni ciped[330]: opendev: alloc: Operation not permitted
This error message only occurs in one place in the source code, which
leads me to believe that this is something external to cipe. Perhaps not
related to Cipe itself, but the kernel and it's allocation of devices and
such.
      if (ioctl_alloc(f, DEVNAME "0", &d)<0)
          err("opendev: alloc");
When this fails on me, I end up with;
Feb 16 16:22:20 nooni ciped[296]: CIPE daemon vers 1.2.0 (c) Olaf Titz
Feb 16 16:22:20 nooni ciped[296]: opendev: alloc: Operation not permitted
My understanding is that if this returns failure, the message will be
generated to the "err" routine.
"ioctl_alloc" is defined in the cipe source code in file "ioctl.h";
extern int ioctl_alloc(int fd, char *ifname, struct siocsifcipall *sio);
Anyone care to comment?
