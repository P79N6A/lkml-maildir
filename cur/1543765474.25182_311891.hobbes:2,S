Linux kernel development is working different.
Getting changes quickly to the users is considered more important than 
API or even ABI compatibility.

Offering improvements and new drivers to the users quickly is one way to 
care about the users.
I do not claim to agree with all details of kernel development - but 
that's how it works.

If you upgrade the kernel, simply get a version of your external modules 
that support your new kernel, compile them against the new kernel, and 
ship the external modules as part of the rollout of the new kernel.

Kernel development is based on the fact that all drivers should be 
shipped with the kernel.
If you buy hardware where no open source driver exists (often because 
the hardware manufacturer doesn't publish the hardware specifications) 
that's your problem.

Space for the code behind all the obsolete interfaces.

There are optimizations that are not possible without breaking 
compatibility.
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt contains examples.

You can't care about everything.
What you propose has both advantages and disadvantages for users of the 
kernel. It's general consensus among the kernel developers that the 
advantages are not worth the disadvantages.
