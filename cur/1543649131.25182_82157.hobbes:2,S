I'm not sure the case for removal has been made. Some potential problems
with the LSM security syscall have been pointed out. Isn't it better to
consider
fixes instead of ditching the syscall? Won't the absence of the syscall just
result
in even worse code being used? Presumably SELinux will have to implement
the syscall functionality some other way.

Precisely. The whole reason for having LSM at all is that maintaining a
kernel
patch to add a security model is not sustainable. Adding a general kernel
framework to support security was the agreed way to go, and that is what
LSM does.
After the latest changes the LSM framework hurts no-one who
isn't using it, so I see no reason to ditch it. If there are
remaining problems let's fix them - not ditch the approach.
