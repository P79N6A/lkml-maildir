so i've compiled a pristine 2.6.10-rc1-bk24 as your patch should be
included there (i've tried to apply your patch with --dry-run -> it did
not succeed, -R *would* have been successful) and finally it works!

snd_ens1371 is working fine, no oops, i can load/unload the drivers, no
problems ;-)

but still:
BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 6 devices found
i have 2 disks now (1 ide, 1 scsi), 2 cdrom drives (ide). as you can see
from the dmesg, i have an additional ide-controller onboard:
PDC20265: chipset revision 2
PDC20265: ROM enabled at 0xdffe0000
PDC20265: 100% native mode on irq 10
PDC20265: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xb400-0xb407, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:DMA
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xb408-0xb40f, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
Probing IDE interface ide2...
hde: ST320413A, ATA DISK drive
ide2 at 0xbc00-0xbc07,0xb802 on irq 10
Probing IDE interface ide3...
Probing IDE interface ide1...
Probing IDE interface ide3...
Probing IDE interface ide4...
ide4: Wait for ready failed before probe !
Probing IDE interface ide5...
ide5: Wait for ready failed before probe !
but there are only 4 ide channels on my board (Gigabyte GA7ZXR):
ide0  - with hda+hdb connected (2x cdrom)
ide1  - none
ide2  - with hde connected (ST320413A)
ide3  - none
so it's probing for a non-existent ide4+ide5! but it did that even in -bk4
times, so it's not "new behaviour", i guess.
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.9-bk4.txt
anyway, it's working now, the oops is gone, but i can do further testing
regarding this EDD issue of course.
Thanks to all involved,
Christian.
