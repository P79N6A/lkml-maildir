It shouldn't have been overwritten - it's probably the result of a
mis-merge.  I would appear that Deepak's change went in via one tree
and mine via my own tree.
As far as that change being unsigned, I don't see why the removal of
a previous addition would require a Sign-off.  We never signed-off
for undoing BK changesets so I'm merely following the established
modus operandi.
I have no view on your patch since I never use any of the config
tools apart from oldconfig.
