No, I'm sorry, I was still unclear.  The spec is 4 writes per page.
I believe that the REASON for this spec was so that people could write
512+16 bytes at a time just like they did with small-block devices and
it would work.
But I do not believe there is any limitation on the pattern you may use,
so your system should work fine.
What confuses me is that I thought I said (quoted above; paraphrasing
here) "there is a very low limit on the number of times you may write
to a page.  That limit is large enough that you can do pagesize/512 =
2048/512 = 4 separate 512-byte writes."  I didn't intend to imply that
that was the ONLY legal pattern.
But from your comments, I'm getting the impression that you think I did
say that was the only legal pattern.  If that impression is correct,
I'm not sure how you read that into my statements.
(I wonder if the actual limit is the number of writes per BLOCK, and
they just expressed it as writes per page.  I don't know enough about
the programming circuitry to know what's exposed to what voltages.
If the physics implied it, it would be useful flexibility for file system
design.)
