Here's a patch that takes bdev->bd_inode->i_sem, and then calls
i_size_write() to update the inode size. My initial tests have been
successful in resizing mounted reiser and xfs filesystems on
2.6.0-test7.

When setting the size of a Device-Mapper device in the gendisk entry, also try
to set the size of the corresponding block_device entry's inode. This is
necessary to allow online device/filesystem resizing to work correctly.
