Spec for bk-lite:
1) Binary with "no worky on other SCM" kinda license
2) update+history+diff (no rollbacks, no modifiable files, no etc...)
In that way all current users of bk2cvs, bk2svn, bk2xxx can simply do a 
pull from a bk repo and have they own scripts on their local machine to do 
their bk2xxx. It will be a lower headache for you and for kernel.org 
maintainers. Is it feasible ?
