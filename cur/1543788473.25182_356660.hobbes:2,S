Hi,
When I copy big file around (500MB) then sometimes the copied file
differs from the source!
I try big copy on an AMD dbau1550 and on an EPIA Mini-ITX board using
several Sata promise controllers (with DMA and without DMA) and using
the IDE interface (with DMA and without DMA) and the problem still
appears!!
More I try busybox 1.0 and 1.01 with kernel 2.4 to 2.6.13 and the
problem still appears... memtest tool doesn't detect error...
I don't know what to do... According to my test, the problem seems to
come from a software bug: maybe something wrong in the kernel? But if it
was a kernel bug why it has NOT been detect before? 
Please help me!
David
