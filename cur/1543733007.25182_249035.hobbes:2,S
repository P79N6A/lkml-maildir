Well, the problem is that one does want the metadata to be in the
ordinary namespace so that they are accessible with POSIX tools.
(The current version of) POSIX does not have a "unified" namespace so a
unified namespace can't be POSIX.
I wonder if it makes sense to have an environment variable (maybe
POSIXLY_CORRECT) to switch between POSIX and the unified namespace
model. Of course, this would mean that all of this is handled in
userspace (e.g. libc), whereas the kernel and filesystems export more
"traditional" (e.g. with openat) interfaces. Accessing metadata as
ordinary files would then work with other filesystems, too.
