I think there's a misunderstanding here.
The march=pentium4 option is only used when you select
"build me a pentium 4 kernel" You do realise that right?
Generic kernels don't change 1 bit.

You know where to find the Intel P4 optimisation manuals..

So what ? Show me a P4 without cmov.

Cmov is completely irrelevant here.
Sure its still an optional instruction which
should be tested for before use, but until Intel
make a P4 without CMOV, adding march=pentium4
is harmless.

Those are probably the same folks who run Gentoo/Slackware/ or
some-other-compile-everything-myself-because-I've-too-much-time-on-my-hands-distro.
Fine, let them be happy.
If some loon wants a P4 optimised /bin/ls, that's his problem,
but optimisation of key components (like say, the kernel) _is_
important.

All you've pointed out is that a P4 kernel won't run
optimally on a 486. Well surprise, it won't run at all.
