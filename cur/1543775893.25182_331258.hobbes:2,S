That's certainly possible.  The question is, at what time does that 
firmware start initializing and how long does it take?  You mentioned 
before that setting "delay_use" to 30 seconds didn't make any difference.

That's not quite right.  It really goes like this:
<key insert>
<usb subsystem identifies device>
<usb-storage driver takes device control> (existing specifiable delay in
	here, via "delay_use")
<sd_mod informed that new SCSI disk exists>
<sd_mod gets total disk capacity, write-protection setting, and other
	stuff>
<sd_mod registers /dev/sdX as a disk and udev learns about it>
<the general disk driver tries to read partition table etc>
<gendisk creates /dev/sdXn entries> (also via udev)
...etc....
It's not clear how any of this affects the device's internal state.

Try putting delays at various spots in sd_revalidate_disk: the beginning,
the middle, and the end.
