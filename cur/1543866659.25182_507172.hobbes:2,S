I have an alternative idea.
There is a test mode of swsusp that's triggered with
"echo test > /sys/power/disk" and "echo disk > /sys/power/state".  We can make
it set a switch that will be used to trigger the warnings in the core.
This way the warnings will only appear in the user's dmesg in the test mode
and not always.
Would that be acceptable?
