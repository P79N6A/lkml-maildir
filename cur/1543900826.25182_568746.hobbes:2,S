It's not that easy. :-)
First, there are memory regions that we don't want to save, because the
restoration of them may cause problems (generally all of the reserved pages
fall into this category).
We also don't want to save free RAM and we don't want to save the memory
occupied by the hibernation kernel (ie. the "new" one).
Also, please note that we can't restore 100% of RAM, even if we save it.
Greetings,
Rafael
