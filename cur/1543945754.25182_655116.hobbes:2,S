oh but then you have a MUCH bigger problem ;(
The bios of that animal is hardcoded to the 5007 (or at least Atheros).
If you stick your own card in, for FCC reasons, the bios refuses the card.
(this is not unique to Asus; all notebooks do this for cards they're
not certified with. This apparently  has to do with the antenna being
part of the laptop, and thus part of the radio in FCC speak)
