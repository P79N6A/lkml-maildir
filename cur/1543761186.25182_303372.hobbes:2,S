I like it, actually.  Now I have support for the wheels on this
logitech wireless keyboard.  Note that most users won't get
trouble, because they use /dev/mice.  Which is something
all single-head machines can do.

The logitech cordless keyboard is one.  It has two wheels.
The one on the side works generates up-arrow/down arrow when used,
and now also events on /dev/mouse0.  The other is a wheel above
the keys, lying on the side.  Logitech apparently meant it to be used as
a volume control, which should be possible now that it attaches to
/dev/mouse0.
Note that /dev/mice isn't always the answer - dual seat machines
need to separate the various mice and keyboards.
