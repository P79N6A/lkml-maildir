I guess some amount if configuration may be necessary.  If you go back
to the beginning of the thread...

...and check the tmpreaper manpage, you will notice that tmpreaper can
be configured as well.  So relatime has a default timeout of T and
tmpreaper is configured to delete files after 1/2 T (never mind what T
might be), the system breaks.  Guessing a value of T that is good enough
for everyone is a complicated business, so one configurable makes sense
imo.
One per mountpoint is rather silly, of course.
