Are we talking 2.4 here?
blk_init_queue calls blk_init_free_list which allocates
QUEUE_NR_REQUESTS for use in the queue.
half for read requests, half for write request or read requests.
blkdev.h defines QUEUE_NR_REQUESTS to be 256.

How do you mean?  If there are any options for coalescence, then the
coalescing will be done before it even notices that the queue is full.
