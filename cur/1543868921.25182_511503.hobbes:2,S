Andrew, while the 2.6.21 merge window has closed, please consider 
applying this to 2.6.21 anyway.  At least one major distribution 
(Fedora) is planning to ship 2.6.21 in its next release, and it would be 
a shame not to give them the stable API they have come not to expect, 
especially as they will support it in their GUI management tools.
I plan two or three other changes over the next few days, and then 
devote the rest of 2.6.21 to working out kinks.  Not that I expect many 
-- the changes are fairly simple.  The last change would be adding a 
forwards and backwards compatible feature availability interface so we 
can extend it later.
The patchset, along with the previous fixset, is available as a git tree 
from git://kvm.qumranet.com/home/avi/kvm/linux-2.6.  You may wish to 
plant it in your little git forest.
[Non-Andrews: please don't clone from this.  Read

 instead]
