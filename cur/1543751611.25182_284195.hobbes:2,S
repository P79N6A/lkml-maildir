This got me to thinking about how you can heuristically optimize away
coalescing support and still allow PAGE_SIZE bytes minimum in the
effective buffer.
Method 1)
Simply keep track of how much data is in the effective buffer.  If the
count is < PAGE_SIZE, then coalesce, otherwise, don't.  Very simple, but
means a high traffic pipe might see 'stuttering' between coalescing mode
and fastpath.
Method 2)
It would be interesting to see the performance of a simple heuristic
whereby writes smaller than a given threshold (PAGE_SIZE >> 3?) are
coalesced with the previous iff the previous also was less than the
threshold and there is room for the write in the given page.
With this heuristic, the minimum size of the effective buffer is only
possible if the sequence consists of alternating threshold (T) bytes and
1 byte writes.
If 'number of pages in circular buffer' (C) is even, this produces a
minimum of (T*C + C)/2 bytes in the effective buffer.  We can figure out
a minimum T value for a given page count C by isolating T from:
(T*C + C)/2 = PAGE_SIZE
which is:
T = (2 * PAGE_SIZE / C) - 1
So with the assumption that we only coalesce if
- - the previous write count was < T
- - the current write count is < T
- - there is room for the current write count in the current page
and if we set C = 16, we can safely let T = (PAGE_SIZE >> 3) - 1 and the
minimum effective buffer is guaranteed to be at least PAGE_SIZE bytes.
This should reduce the amount of coalescing work required and thus
reduce the amount of locking required for the case where performance
counts (on x86, the writer would have to write 511 bytes to use the
non-coalescing fast path).
This method is probably better as many writers will be buffering their
writes, and the size also nicely fits with block layer's blocksize.
Just my two cents.
