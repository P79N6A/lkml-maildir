Thanks shaohua, since the initial code has been collecting dust for 
some several months now, and I never got time to finish it.
Think you forgot to cc the ia64 crowd. We tried to do it a little bit more
generic way, but some required arch assist due to some differences.
Andrew: please help stage in -mm since we would need more extensive testing
and help feedback to fix any before becomming prime time.
It would also help to check if other archs have any compile issues etc..
