It is being _developed_, it is _not_ part of the regular kernel yet.

Point about API changing taken. Other rant you can keep to yourself.

Alphas are relatively rare, so not that much testing goes into them as into
i386. You could pay somebody to do it for you... might even come cheaper
than the licence for DEC Unix (or whatever it is called today).

Not part of the stock kernel either.

Not part of the stock kernel.

Ever heard of mtools? FAT is broken, and has been for a long time. The
design of FAT is in itself broken, that's why. And not _that_ many people
use it, or it would have been fixed by now.

Have you even done a rough calculation of _how_much_ work this is?
Jeez, they get the kernel and the whole userland for free (or nearly so) in
exchange for the privilege of doing testing of the stuff, and complain when
it doesn't work smoothly. Even when they do stuff that is _clearly_
unsupported (RedHat-5.2 has some hacks for running 2.2 kernels, but *on
your own risk*) they complain loudly...

Just go over to the Support Department of your favorite commercial Unix
vendor, ask for somebody to help you. Price for Premium, round-the-clock
support is quite steep, mind you.  And you'll only get kernels that are
deemed fit for public consumption in the first place. Oh, you also might
have to junk your machine and get a supported one as part of the deal.
Either you stay with the distribution you picked, buy the official version
and get support, or you decide to live dangerously and download your own
kernels. In both cases, better shut up unless you have something to say.
