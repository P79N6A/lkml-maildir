Ah, you are quite right, that'll teach me to rush out a patch just
because dinner is ready :-). 
How about we submit the following patch for mainline and CC -stable to
fix .23 and .24:

There is a race condition between schedule() and some dequeue/enqueue
functions; rt_mutex_setprio(), __setscheduler() and sched_move_task().
When scheduling to idle, idle_balance() is called to pull tasks from
other busy processor. It might drop the rq lock.
It means that those 3 functions encounter on_rq=0 and running=1.
The current task should be put when running.
Here is a possible scenario;
   CPU0                               CPU1
    |                              schedule()
    |                              ->deactivate_task()
    |                              ->idle_balance()
    |                              -->load_balance_newidle()
rt_mutex_setprio()                     |
    |                              --->double_lock_balance()
    *get lock                          *rel lock
    * on_rq=0, ruuning=1               |
    * sched_class is changed           |
    *rel lock                          *get lock
    :                                  |
                                       :
                                   ->put_prev_task_rt()
                                   ->pick_next_task_fair()
                                       => panic
The current process of CPU1(P1) is scheduling. Deactivated P1,
and the scheduler looks for another process on other CPU's runqueue
because CPU1 will be idle. idle_balance(), load_balance_newidle()
and double_lock_balance() are called and double_lock_balance() could
drop the rq lock. On the other hand, CPU0 is trying to boost the
priority of P1. The result of boosting only P1's prio and sched_class
are changed to RT. The sched entities of P1 and P1's group are never
put. It makes cfs_rq invalid, because the cfs_rq has curr and no leaf,
but pick_next_task_fair() is called, then the kernel panics.
