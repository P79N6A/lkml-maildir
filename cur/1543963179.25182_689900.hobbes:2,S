Hi.
The line in the subject is printed on the screen at every boot. It
never happened before. Is it something to worry about?
Also, there is this new line:
BIOS bug, APIC version is 0 for CPU#0! fixing up to 0x10. (tell your hw vendor)
FWIW, the machine is an HP DV4378EA laptop, so if there's someone from
HP listening...
cheers,
Fabio
