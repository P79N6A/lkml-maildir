Subject: [patch] 2.6.10-mm2: move CPUSETS above EMBEDDED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The placement of CPUSETS somewhere in the middle of the EMBEDDED options 
breaks the EMBEDDED submenu (at least in menuconfig).
The patch below fixes this by simply moving CPUSETS above EMBEDDED.
