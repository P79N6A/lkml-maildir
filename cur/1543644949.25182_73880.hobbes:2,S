I'm now after both behaviors...

        (name->next = NULL)
#define INIT_SLIST_LOOP(name)			\

No, they're not.

Well, I can only try to preserve the pointer target, since I don't have a 
previous entry. (Thus the overly complicated slist_del.)

It's the one which previously contained it...
I don't know whether I should like the list header aproach.
It's not bad for either circular lists or such which will have to be gone 
through only once, as using slist_pop().

But you see we have the problem that there is no such thing as a 
predeclared structure for it. The only thing we can rely on is a chain of 
structures which alltogether have a ->next field pointing to another 
structure of presumably the same type.

Yes, I've forgotten two things there. They are fixed in my file, which I 
won't post right now (in order not to pollute the list too much with 
patches. It's that fix plus a forgotten _in.)

Oh, that was just for Jes Soerensen, who kept asking.
