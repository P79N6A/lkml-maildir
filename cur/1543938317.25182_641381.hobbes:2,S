Instrumentation done where exactly ?
tcpdump on the host will lie, since timestamps are probably going to be host 
timestamps, giving the time of RX dequeing, and not time of packets arrival 
given by NIC.

You have some tasks that disable softirqs too long. Sometimes, bumping RX ring 
size is OK (but you will still have delays), sometimes it is not an option, 
since 4096 is the limit on current hardware.
