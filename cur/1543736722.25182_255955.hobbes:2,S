These results seem reasonable ... thanks.

But would the time cost of being out of line be noticable either?
Actually, being out of line might be a tick faster, if it reduced by a
cache line what was needed for a common execution path.

Is there any non-trivial risk that some other "unfortunate side affect"
exists today, that we'd find on benchmarking?
I'm not sure its worth benchmarking again, but I slightly suspect it is,
and if benchmarking was done, I'd do it with these calls both inline and
out of line, to see what affect that had on runtime.  If no affect on
runtime, I'd tend toward the out of line calls - at least saving a
little kernel text space.
