Actually people running HPC apps also like 64kB pages since their TLB
misses go down significantly, and their data files tend to be large.
Fileserving for windows boxes should also benefit, since both the
executables and the data files that typical office applications on
windows use are largish.  I got a distribution of file sizes for a
government department office and concluded that 64k pages would only
bloat the page cache by a few percent for that case.
