It should "just work".   4G+4G is false advertising:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_4G_VM_LAYOUT
#define __PAGE_OFFSET		(0x02000000)
#define TASK_SIZE		(0xff000000)
#else
I'm a bit confused as to what significance the faulting address has btw:
kernel code can raise prefetch faults against addresses which are less
than, and presumably greater than TASK_SIZE.
