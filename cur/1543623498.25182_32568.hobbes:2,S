Well, Martin promised to reimplement it better later if there is demand
for it, and it seems there is. So I suppose it's going away only to be
replaced by something better.
There was a flamewar about this some time ago - whether the kernel
should or should not parse the taskfile access to prevent possibly
dangerous commands sent to the drive - if this is to be used for
validation, then all commands need to be allowed, which also will enable
to thin the code considerably.
