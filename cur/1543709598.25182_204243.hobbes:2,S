Well I have been running 2.4.24 plus the freeswan patch for over a month 
and I had no problems att all. It is only with 2.4.25 plus the freeswan 
patch that I saw this oops, note that it have only happend once with 
2.4.25 and I have no idea how to trigger it yet.
So I think this started to happen with 2.4.25 plus the freeswan patch.
