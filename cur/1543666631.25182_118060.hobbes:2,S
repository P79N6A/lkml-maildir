I had exactly these symptoms about a year ago in 2.4.18.  I found and
fixed the problem and have just checked and the fix is definately in
2.4.20.
So if you really are running 2.4.20 then it looks like a similar bug
has appeared.
These two symptoms strongly suggest a buffer aliasing problem.
i.e. you have two buffers (one for data and one for metadata)
that refer to the same location on disc.
One is part of a file that was recently deleted, but the buffer hasn't
been flushed yet.  The other is part of a new directory.
The old buffer and the new buffer both get written to disc at much the
same time (hence the "multiple 1 requests"), but the old buffer hits
the disc second and so corrupts the filesystem.
The bug I found was specific to data=journal mode, and this certainly
has more options for buffer aliasing.  Were you using data=journal?
