There's a related bug in bugzilla: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9546
The diagnostic from Jan Kara is different though, but I think it may be the same
problem...
"One process does data-intensive load. Thus in the ordered mode the
transaction is tiny but has tons of data buffers attached. If commit
happens, it takes a long time to sync all the data before the commit
can proceed... In the writeback mode, we don't wait for data buffers, in
the journal mode amount of data to be written is really limited by the
maximum size of a transaction and so we write by much smaller chunks
and better latency is thus ensured."
I'm hitting this bug too...it's surprising that there's not many people
reporting more bugs about this, because it's really annoying.
There's a patch by Jan Kara (that I'm including here because bugzilla didn't
include it and took me a while to find it) which I don't know if it's supposed to
fix the problem , but it'd be interesting to try:
Don't allow too much data buffers in a transaction.
