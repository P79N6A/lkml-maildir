Subject: Strange italics with -ac kernels

	In KDE and sometimes also seen in netscape, I get displays in italics
which I don't in any non-ac kernels. All KDE menus now show up in
discontinuous italics that are not really readable. I'm using
XFree86-4.0.3, KDE-2.1.1 and an NVidia 32Meg TNT2 M64 card, but I've had
the same with much earlier 2.4.x-ac kernels using a VOODO 3 card.
	Any ideas ?
Regards
