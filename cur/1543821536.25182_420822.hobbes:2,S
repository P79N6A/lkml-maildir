Almost.  mdadm doesn't support this layout yet.  
'f2' is a similar layout, but the offset stripes are a lot further
down the drives.
It will possibly be called 'o2' or 'offset2'.

o4 on a 4 drive array would be 
   A  B  C  D
   D  A  B  C
   C  D  A  B
   B  C  D  A
   E  F  G  H
   ....

What exactly would that mean?  And what would be the advantage?
