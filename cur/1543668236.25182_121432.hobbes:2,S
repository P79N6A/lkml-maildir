Well, I do not necessarily think that renicing X is the problem.  Just
an idea.
We do have a problem, though.  Nearly indefinite starvation and all sort
of weird effects like bash not able to create a new process... its a
bug.
Renicing X, aside from some weird client-server starvation issues with
stuff like multimedia programs, should not cause any problem.  It should
help, in fact.  But, you are right, its not needed in the current
scheduler.
