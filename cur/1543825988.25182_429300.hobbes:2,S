Subject: Why NFS enforce size limit on readdirplus

Maybe this question is a little dumb.
I am wondering why in NFS readdirplus can be used only for directories
of size less than 8*PAGE_SIZE, otherwise, it will switch to use normal
readdir?
In nfs/inode.c, I noticed the following code:
			    if (nfs_server_capable(inode, NFS_CAP_READDIRPLUS) &&
fattr->size <= NFS_LIMIT_READDIRPLUS)
				    set_bit(NFS_INO_ADVISE_RDPLUS, &NFS_FLAGS(inode));
Can someone kindly explain the reason?
Thanks a lot!
Xin
