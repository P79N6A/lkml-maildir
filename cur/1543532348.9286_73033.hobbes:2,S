   Is it just me or does SMP stand for "Symmetric Multi-Processing" where
the word Symmetric implies that all the processors being used are
identical? Or does this Symmetric mean something else (shared memory
model?). I find it strange that you have an SMP computer with different
CPUs and I thought this wasn't possible with Intel chipsets.
   It sounds to me like this is a recipe for disaster and no wonder apps
that use time counters break :)
