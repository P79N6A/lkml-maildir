All ncr53c8xx/sym53c8xx driver revisions I have made available are
intended to be source compatible for linux-2.0.36/37 and 2.2.x, and only a
few revisions were not so.  What you want to check when A+B does not work
for you, is to give a try to A+B' or/and A'+B and report what combinations
does not work for you and what does.
So, you may give a try to:
- linux-2.0.36 + driver files of linux-2.2.3   (A+B')
  (linux/drivers/scsi/ncr53c8xx.[ch])
You also can try the latest material available for the driver. It may
takes a non negligible time for new _ready_ driver material to go into the
kernels main-stream, despite the fact that I delay new versions long
enough to ensure that the new code is safe. The resulting large patches
are sometime delayed by kernel main-stream maintainers (stable and
latest), for the reason they are large, although the code have been
heavily tested. Btw, I understand perfectly kernel maintainers, given all
the broken patches they often are provided with and I cannot change that. 
The latest material is in the following directory:
     
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/misc-stuff/
Files are:
           ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.0.36.patch.gz
           ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.0.37-pre8.patch.gz
           ncr-8xx-896-bundle-for-linux-2.2.3.patch.gz
I will set-up a new tree for the new driver packaging today and also
provide driver object modules in the future. (New packaging =
ncr53c8xx+sym53c8xx bundle). 
Regards,
   Gérard.
