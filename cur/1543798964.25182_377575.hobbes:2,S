yes, generic mutexes have that much better scheduling in this workload.  
[ And no, there's no secret speedup magic hidden in the scheduler ;) ] 
See my other reply to Linus about why there's such a difference.

hm, i'm not so sure about adaptive mutexes - i'm a bit uneasy about 
wasting cycles on spinning, it will inevitably cause wasted resources in 
some workloads. I think the right approach is to make scheduling fast 
and cheap, and to improve the queueing/wakeup logic of kernel code.
but by all means feel free to experiment with adaptive mutexes, all the 
mutex logic is located in kernel/mutex.c, and it is well-suited for 
rapid prototyping of new locking logic.
