That'll be hard to do, because 2.6.9->2.6.10-rc1 was one of those brief
periods of frenetic patchbombing.
You could try 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 and if the bug is there, try 2.6.9-rc4-mm1's
linus.patch and if the bug is not there, iterate though 2.6.9-rc4-mm1's
patches.
If the bug isn't in 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 I guess you're down to a binary search
with `bk clone'.  It might be a bit easier with bkcvs actually.
