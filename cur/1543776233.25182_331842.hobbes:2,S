I disabled the trace and the STACKOVERFLOW option seems to help; I've got a 
(slightly truncated) oops from the kernel. What happens is that I get an 
oops, then I get a BUG: warning me about the softlock, then I get another 
oops. I'm about to reboot to confirm whether the second oops is identical to 
the first (I suspect that it is).
Is this any help do you?
