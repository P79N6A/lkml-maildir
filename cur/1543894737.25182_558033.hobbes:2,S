Hi,
I notice with our version, it's running 2.4.20 but has the O(1)
scheduling patch.
Specifically, we see that the process sleeps inside an ioctl for more
than 3 secs, 
wakes up, comes out of the blocking call and is immediately scheduled
out. After 
this, it's not scheduled for next 4 secs. 
Does this look like a fairness/starvation issue ?
Thanks,
Ravi

Hi,
I have a question about scheduling latencies in 2.4.20. We are seeing
that our process (started with default priority, normal fork, exec) is
not scheduled on the CPU for 4 seconds (from our kernel traces). Is that
possible under heavy load ? We believe the process is still alive but I
wanted to know if anybody has an idea from experimental results, about
the worst case scenario.
From syscall trace, we also know that the process is not inside any
blocking system call.
Thanks,
Ravi
