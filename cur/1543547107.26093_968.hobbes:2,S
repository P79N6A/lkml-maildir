Won't we loose some important info by not looking at minors?  hda and
hdb are minors of IDE0_MAJOR, etc.  Is this data distinguishable in the queues?

True for the kernel, but there are some user land apps that read /proc/stat
quite frequently (10 per second) so some performance tuning might be
worth it.  There could be a linked list field in the blk_dev[] array
which links all entries that have had statistics collected. Then the /proc
code does not have to blk_get_queue on every major.
