This is a bit scary to me. Privilege and mode inheritance across
processes is the root of many nasty surprises, security and otherwise. 
Here's a crazy alternative: add a flag to containers instead? I think
this is a better match to what you're trying to do and will keep people
from being surprised when an mlockall call in one thread causes a
fork/exec in another thread to crash their box, but only sometimes.
