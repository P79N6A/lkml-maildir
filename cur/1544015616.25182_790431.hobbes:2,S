Well "git bisect" can be more usefull if it can be fully automated (with git 
bisect run) because then you can make the computer do all the boring work. 
So I think putting people on the "brainless course of actions" can often be 
a good thing.
Anyway it looks to me that this kind of problem could be avoided if one 
could "replace" some commits only when bisecting. In this case what could 
be done is that one could "replace" the commit where btrfs is merged with 
one commit that cuts off the btrfs history. If the merge commit is only 
replaced when bisecting, then you get the best of both worlds:
_ when you bisect, you don't see the btrfs history that breaks the kernel 
build,
_ when you don't bisect, you see the full real history.
Of course if the bisection process finds out that the "replaced" commit is 
the culprit, then you need to understand what this means...

Christian.
