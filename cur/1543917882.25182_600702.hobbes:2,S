I did not see a requirement for a major rewrite for a tool or a toolset. I saw 
a requirement for one specific improvement to the output of one specific 
program. It seems to be an improvement that will provide immediate benefits, 
so is worthwhile even if it will eventually be superceded by a new generation 
of the tool..
After making my living as a software engineer for the past 26 years, I know 
better than to start learning a new environment by setting out to make major 
architectural changes. Or without adequately detailed requirements (even if 
they are self-generated). Apparently the newbies you complain about have not 
learned these lessons yet, leading to incomplete and unfinished projects. 
When I have used this little project as a gateway into the toolset, I might 
consider taking part in your larger redesign project as a follow on, if you 
can provide more detailed and coherent specifications for what you want done. 
Or not. 
In this case, no one is paying me to deal with inadequate specifications and 
rude people, so I may find something else to do with my spare time and 
equipment.
