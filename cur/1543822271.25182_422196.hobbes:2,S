A lot of these patches go through major APIs and seemingly-randomly prepare
to unexport things based on whether they are presently used within modules.
So, for example, drivers/base/attribute_container.c gets a whole pile of
exports scheduled for removal, regardless of whether the resulting module
API makes *sense*.  Ditto scsi core.  And lib/*.
For example this:
  EXPORT_SYMBOL(generic_getxattr);
 -EXPORT_SYMBOL(generic_listxattr);
 +EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL(generic_listxattr); /* removal in 2.6.19 */
  EXPORT_SYMBOL(generic_setxattr);
  EXPORT_SYMBOL(generic_removexattr);
just seems random to me, and it's setting us up for later churn.
So hum.  Don't you think it'd be better to look at each API as a whole,
make decisions about what parts of it _should_ be offered to modules,
rather then looking empirically at which parts presently _need_ to be
exported?
