But how does relayfs organize the namespace then? What if I have
multiple channels per CPU, each for a different type of data, will
all channels for the same CPU be under the same directory or will
each type of data have its own directory with one entry per CPU?
I don't have an answer to that, and I don't know that we should. Why
not just leave it to the client to organize his data as he wishes.
If we must assume that everyone will have at least one channel per
CPU, then why not provide helper functions built on top of very
basic functions instead of fixing the namespace in stone?

This is not good for any client that doesn't know beforehand the exact
size of their data units, as in the case of LTT. If LTT has to use this
code that means we are going to loose performance because we will need to
fill an intermediate data structure which will only be used for relay_write().
Instead of zero-copy, we would have an extra unnecessary copy. There has
got to be a way for clients to directly reserve and write as they wish.
Even Zach Brown recognized this in his tracepipe proposal, here's from
his patch:

Sorry, I'm still missing something. What exactly does local_add_return()
do? I assume this code has got to be interrupt safe? Something like:
#define local_add_return(OFFSET, LEN) \
do {\
...
	local_irq_save(); \
	OFFSET += LEN;
	local_irq_restore(); \
...
} while(0);
I'm assuming local_irq_XXX because we were told by quite a few people
in the related thread to avoid atomic ops because they are more expensive
on most CPUs than cli/sti.
Also how does relay_get_buffer() operate? What if I'm writing an event
from within a system call and I'm about to switch buffers and get
an interrupt at the if(likely(...))? Isn't relay_get_buffer() going to
return the same pointer as the one obtained for the syscall, and aren't
both cases now going to effect relay_switch_buffer(), one of which will
be superfluous?

Fine, but how is the client going to be able to reuse the same buffer if
relayfs always assumes per-CPU buffer as you said above? This would be
solved if at its core relayfs' functions worked on single channels and
additional code provided helpers for making the SMP case very simple.

I believe Tom has refactored the code with your comments in mind, and has
something ready for review. I just want to clear up the above before we
make this final. Among other things, he just dropped all modes, and there's
only a basic relay_write() that closely resembles what you have above.

Sure, see above in the case of LTT.
