Im trying to install linux in an ATA Flash Memory Card from Hitachi.
In DOS mode, this card works like an IDE HDD but the same doesnt
happens with linux. While DOS fdisk works fine, linux fdisk returns
the following errors when trying to write the partition table:
Re-reading the partition table
hda hdb ..
hda:drive_cmd:status=0x51 {DriveReadt SeekComplete Error}
hda:drive_cmd:error=0x04 {DriveStatusError}
The partition table is writen but mkswap returns the same errors!
Could someone give me any tip ?
Thanks a lot
Joao
