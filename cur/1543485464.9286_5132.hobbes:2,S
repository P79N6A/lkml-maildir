I just bought a new machine from Siemens and it comes with a keyboard that has the
Euro symbol on the 5 key.  There are no instructions included on how to use it,
but it could be shift-alt-5 or right-alt-5.  I guess we want this to be the same
in Linux as in other OS'es. The keyboard I have has an US layout. For what it is
worth, the Euro key doesn't work in the pre installed OS either...(Windows 98,
Dutch version).
