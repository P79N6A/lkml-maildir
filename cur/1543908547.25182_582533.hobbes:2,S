Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Add some missing Documentation/*/00-INDEX files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Rob Landley is trying to organize Linux kernel documentation. One 
thing he is doing is generating index.html files based on our 
00-INDEX files in the Documentation directory. He has met with a 
small problem however, since not all subdirectories inside 
Documentation contain such a file, nor are all the files that do 
exist up to date, his index.html files turn up rather incomplete.
In a reply to a recent post to linux-doc, where Rob also posted his 
script for generating the index.html files, I offered to help out 
with that situation and create (at least some of) the missing 
00-INDEX files. These patches represent the first five files I've 
created.
The reason I'm not submitting more files at this time is simply 
that I want to get some feedback before wasting too much time 
creating these files if it turns out that for some reason they are 
not wanted. This is also the reason why I'm cross posting to LKML 
at this time, since I suspect that not very many people currently 
read linux-doc.
So please do the ACK/NACK/Merge dance with these patches and 
let me know if more are wanted or not. :-)
Kind regards,
  Jesper Juhl <jesper.juhl@gmail.com>
