Assume BIOS = just enough to appear to work with Windows. My VAIO appears
to lose at least the spindown timeout setting, probably more on suspend.
It also loses some video state - if I suspend when the screen is blanked
by X, restore gets me a white screen of death - no way to make video come
back to life. Now that I've got hibernate working, I've figured out that I
can hibernate/unhibernate to get the card back into the state X thinks it
should be in.
