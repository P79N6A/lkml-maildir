Sure, it need to be replaced, or at least complemented, with real auto 
detection. If I only could provide this list...

sanity_check do it for me.

See above, it is placeholder for real auto detection routine.

Yes, separation into generic and platform specific part seems nice, but 
besides memory mapping and locking, all you have is
very simple arithmetic. Does it worth the work for separation?
For 64-bit world, agree, it could and should be done uniform.

Indeed, it may be better to BUG() here. I did not paid attention. By the 
way, for other access methods alignment is simply not verified. 
Probable, it is ensured by some other way and I can just remove this test?

Good point. s/readb(addr)/readl(addr & ~3)/

Not this bad. For PCI devices after bridges, 4k also provided. 
Everything after 256 bytes is simply useless, but present. It reads as 0.
