       ``Modern'' is not the word I'd use for the standard PC-style ports
       on an IBM PC clone.
       When I load a kernel that doesn't have one of the farm of parallel
       drivers attached, the machine recognises the parallel port, but 
       the kernel loads up blithely unaware that anything out of the
       ordinary is done.

       Yes, in an environment where you either (a) speculatively
       load every possible driver to see what hardware is on the
       system, (b) don't use modules, or (c) put autoprobing for
       everything under the sun into the kernel.
       If the solution de jour to get rid of that icky devfs is
       one of these, I'll say that the cure is much much worse
       than the disease.
