Subject: [PATCH] 3/3 handle level triggered irqs on dbox2 (2.4.22-pre6)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This one is for components of the dbox2 which cannot be set up to do
edge triggered irqs because no documentation is available. #ifdef
CONFIG_DBOX2 is put around it because other boards don't seem to need
it. Is there a better way to handle level based interrupts?
