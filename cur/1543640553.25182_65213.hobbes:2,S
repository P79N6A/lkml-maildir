I have some problems with 2.5.31. I boot from an initial
ramdisk and my /sbin/init script is at the end of the mail.
I do get sash on both tty's, but typing any command just
locks up this shell. I tried "cd tmp", "-ls", and a few
others. Even "-cat sbin/init" locks up. Any attempt to
reboot using CTRL+ALT+DEL or ALT+SYSRQ+B results in a
solid lockup, at this point only a hard reset is possible.
Can anybody provide me a hint on where to find the problem?
Or do I have to do binary search through the patch?
#!/bin/sh
mount /proc /proc -t proc
mount /tmp /tmp -t tmpfs
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
ifconfig eth0 62.xx.xxx.91
route add default gw 62.xx.xxx.1
while true
do
        open -c 2 -w /bin/sash
done &
while true
do
        open -c 1 -w /bin/sash
done
