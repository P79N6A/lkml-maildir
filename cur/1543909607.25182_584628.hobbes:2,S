Like the script! Especially since it reveled --since=6.month.ago and 
uniq to me.
Just wondering, why order them in the acked, signed and tested? Other 
then removing those, the added 'sed' also fix the <name> vs 
"<name>"-"problem". + adding '-i' to uniq should help the result too, right?
Now a simple "diffstat -p1 -l <patch> | xargs <preferred script-name>" 
makes the day. Too bad, as Joe pointed out, it does not include relevant ML.
