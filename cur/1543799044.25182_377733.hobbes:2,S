Considering that on UP, the arm should not need to disable interrupts
for this function (or has someone refuted Linus?), how about:
#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
typedef struct { volatile int counter; } mutex_counter_t;
static inline int mutex_counter_dec_return(mutex_counter *v)
{
     return --v->counter;
}
...
#else
#define mutex_counter_t atomic_t
...
#endif
Or does that get too bulky or have other problems?
MP ARMs should have an adequate atomic_dec_return.
