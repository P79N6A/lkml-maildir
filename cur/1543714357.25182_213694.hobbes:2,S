People looking at PROT_EXEC page table flags might want to be aware
that <asm-um/pgtable.h> mimics the behaviour of i386: read implies and
is implied by exec, write implies read.
That might mean user-mode linux doesn't provide no-exec-stack
protection even when the underlying kernel does offer it.  I'm not sure.
