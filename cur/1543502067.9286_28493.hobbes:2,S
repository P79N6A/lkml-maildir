  Hmmm... It's really bad idea for working with config files... But, mainly I
want to do the next thing: I want to map some file as block device (i.e.
I want that /dev/??? file is appeared and it's content was identical to the
content of my file)... But, I solved this problem already by use
flip_open(..., ..., ...)->f_op->read/write. (BTW, is it normal way to use
file, or not???)
Thank you for help.
 Bye...
