If it requires MAP_FIXED I would beg to disagree.

Seems sensible to me. If you specifically need that mapping behaviour and
ask for it then it wouldn't be hard to provide.

Randomisation has nothing to do with C. In fact from a C perspective the
compiler and linker do a lot of work to deal with ELF and loading code at
arbitary addresses for dynamic linking and the like, not the user and
not as language constructs. Perhaps the Lisp universe should wake up and
meet the 1980s 8)
