It doesn't need to be a fully functional APIC.  It just needs to not 
have one particular bug - Pentium processor erratum 11AP.  There is no 
reason that most of these requirements can't be dropped.  We used to 
have a lot more functionality and legacy support turned off, and we 
gradually turned it back on.  Turning on the BIOS interfaces will cause 
complications for a VMI kernel running in a hypervisor - since it can't 
invoke non-virtualized BIOS code.  So it does require a bit of 
conditional logic, which is pretty easy, but we haven't got around to 
doing yet.
