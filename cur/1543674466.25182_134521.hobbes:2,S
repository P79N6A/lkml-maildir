Hi Ingo.

So if either we explicitly loaded the problem or we found it, the
test fails and we skip the entire body of that if statement.
Remember, if module_loaded_flag is non-zero then !module_loaded_flag
fails. Since you're using && and the link, !found isn't even tested
in that case.

Doesn't happen - the logic on the if test at the top will always fail
and we'll just fall straight back down to just below this line.

It doesn't get reused though...

True.

Personally, I need a good reason for using goto's, more so than too
many of the kernel developers, and your code is a perfect example
of the reason why - the goto accomplishes absolutely nothing because
of the faulty logic in the if statement - but the faulty logic is
actually hidden by the goto in this case.
Best wishes from Riley.
