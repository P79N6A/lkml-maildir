Done.
In addition to pushing to the bkbits.net acpi-test-* trees,
I'll publish a plain patch every time I commit a cset to acpi-test-*
tree.
Like we've traditionally done on sourceforge.net, I'll continue to
publish a cumulative plain patch every time the acpi-release-* tree is
updated,
but these will not live on sourceforge.net any more.
The folks at kernel.org have graciously volunteered the space.
Here's the plan:

And attached for the curious is my handy bk.checkin wrapper script.
Thank you for your continued patience and support.
