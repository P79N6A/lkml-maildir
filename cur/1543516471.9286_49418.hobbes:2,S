Good day, Riley et al,
	Executive summary: The following offers a little in the way of
design suggestions, but tends to be more focused on possible uses of a
union/transparent approach from a non-kernel-programmer perspective.

	I tend to like the idea that if a file exists on more than one
level, the version on the topmost media that has it wins.

	Agreed.

	How about a simpler approach:
	Reading a file would pull it off the topmost media that had it.
Writing a file would write it back to the topmost RW media - even if that
was a different media than originally held the file.
	The administrator can then order the mounts so that the media most
likely to have the preferred version of a file is on top.
	By writing to the topmost RW media, an administrator could even
stick one last RO media on the _top_ of the stack (i.e., mounted last);
any files in this media would automatically override any files on the RW
media below - although one could successfully write to them, the OS would
still use the version from the RO media on top.  An alternate way of
creating immutable files, essentially.

	As above, the topmost RW media.
	It logically follows that if all media are RO, the stack is also
RO.

	Hmmm... That's a toughie.  Does that imply that a userland app
needs to be involved in the media decision, or could this requirement be
satisfied with some list of pid's that write to media1, another list that
writes to media2, etc?  Even the latter might be problematic; does the
kernel have access to the owner pid when the media choice needs to be
made?  What happens when chmod changes the owner?

	This is the one that holds an awe-inspiring amount of promise for
me.
	I do my base install of distribution X, tar it up, and burn
multiple CD's with the content.  A few head off to other buildings for
archive/backup.  I mount one of the CD's and an empty ext2 drive on top
as part of mounting the root filesystem (root=/dev/scd0,/dev/sda1).  All
of the the changes I make are on the hard drive; the CD holds the
absolutely immutable pristine image.
	After a month or so, I tar up the contents of the hard drive only,
and burn a new CD from the hard drive contents.  Now the mount sequence is
pristine, month1CD, empty HD.
	After another month, I tar up the hard drive+month1CD to get
month2CD.  The month1CD goes into storage and the boot sequence is
pristine, month2CD, emptyHD.  Lather, Rinse, repeat.
	What do I get out of this?
	- I _always_ have a pristine image to fall back on if I get
hacked.  In fact, I can just back up as many months as necessary.
	- I have a reasonably efficient method of making weekly or monthly
backups; permanent ones that I can always go back to.  Cheap backups, too.
Live backups that can be directly mounted instead of being solely
accessible through a backup application.
	- If I want to upgrade distributions or change to a completely
different one, I just replace the lowest pristine image with another.
(OK, the LSB isn't quite there yet, but the theory is still reasonably
good...)
	- If I'm doing some testing of an app, or library upgrade, or
major change to my system that might make it unusable afterwards, I make
sure I have a CD burned just before I start.  If something goes wrong, no
problem.
	- I install a distribution and customize it to be a
router/firewall.  It gets burned to a CD.  The next level up could be a
floppy or pcmcia card or ramdisk (at startup and shutdown, the contents
would need to be restored and backed up, respectively, to somewhere).
	- I do a base install of a distribution, burn 30 CD's of it, and
carry the CD's to lab workstations.  At the end of a class period, I go to
single user mode, mke2fs the hard drive, and reboot; this could even be
the default on shutdown.  A network drive would be available for permanent
storage of projects.
	- Any of the above references to CD could be replaced by coda,
nfs, or samba mounted partition, or even another hard drive mounted
read-only.
	- If some CD ends up with more than 680M of data, I just split the
files onto two or more.
	Please understand; I am _not_ advocating that the kernel suddenly
takes responsibility for some individual's inability to manage his/her
system.  I _do_ understand that various uses of tripwire, rpm -V, tape
backups, symlink farms, boot and shutdown time tars, additional hard
drives, shell scripts, rdist/scp, common sense, etc. can very reasonably
stand in for any of the above.  These pre-union/transparent approaches
_do_ work now and will continue to be available.
	I'm simply pointing out that the above union/transparent approach
opens up a realm of possibilities that give the administrator an
additional tool that, in some circumstances, might be "better" in that
person's opinion.

	Last one (=topmost) mounted would be my preference.  Simpler to
implement. Perhaps there should later be some kind of option similar to
mounting an older image on a multi-write CD.
>  >>> - What happens if I remount in another order later?
	You change which file appears.  Hey, the same problem exists if
you swap scsi ID's and aren't using something like Ted's UUID's or
Richard's devfs, so this isn't a new concept to admins.  Please, no devfs
wars; I immediately grant you that your opinion on this is absolutely
correct.

	Interesting question.  Would this require some kind of "negative
dentry" that persists as long as the union is mounted?  Should that
negative dentry be stored on the topmost writable media or not?

	In my view of the process, cow would be the default.  It would be
understood that when first booting a system set up this way that there
would be a lot of copying.
	For some far-in-the-future version, the concept of copy-on-read
would be marvelous too; the hard drive could transparently act as a local
cache to a remote nfs volume for only the files you actually access.  One
could start off with an nfs volume that had an _entire_ distribution
installed and an empty local drive.  As files get read, they get copied to
the local hard drive.
	After a few weeks of priming the local cache, the union could
theoretically get broken and have just a straight hard drive mount for,
say, a laptop.  What happens when the laptop user wants a file they 
didn't use before breaking the union, what happens when a newer
version shows up on the nfs server, etc....

	While I could certainly believe that there might be programming or
kernel details that might require this, if we took the "read from the
topmost media that has the file" and "write to the topmost RW media", the
above two restrictions wouldn't _seem_ to be necessary.  But maybe I've
missed something.
	Thanks for your time.  Cheers,
	- Bill
