The reason this entire thread started is because Linus, Jeff and others
said that they didn't want code magically compiled into their kernel
that they did not explicitly ask for -- even if the savings were small
and that kernel was already something rather beefy, such as ACPI+SMP.
The current code is simply broken, because it allows SUSPEND
on IA64 if UP, but not on SMP.  It should really be neither.
Further, the only requirement to enable CONFIG_SUSPEND by default
is PM && CONFIG_SMP=n, and that doesn't make much sense -- particularly
since many of the non X86 architectures are small and according
to the logic above, if SUSPEND (and PM_SLEEP, which it enables)
adds any code to those kernels when they don't need it,
then it would be a regression.
thus my patch, if there is a list for SMP, there should
be a list for !SMP.  If the list is incomplete, we need to fix it.
