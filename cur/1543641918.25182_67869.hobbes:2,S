Must I conclude that you did not read my entire letter?
Since we started this small detour talking about media change,
let me quote that fragment once more.
"[Don't think that I actually propose doing this today as the default,
but it would be a very small patch to add this as an optional
behaviour. But there is today, and there is the faraway goal.
The faraway goal is: no partition table reading in the kernel.
And that influences designing today what to do on media change.
Already today I would consider it entirely reasonable if there
was no automatic partition table reading after a media change.]"
No, my suggested changes would not break a single Linux installation
in the world.
