they *might* compete for buffer space depending on available memory,
and they might not.  further, if these guys are burning much *other*
than kernel cpu cycles, i'd like to know why :)

ah victor, you're just not spending enough time with us audio freaks :)
the soundcard ADAC might look like a file, and it might be represented
by a node in a filesystem, but it isn't a file. a device like an ADAC,
or a serial port, or a parallel port, or a network interface, isn't
capable of being bypassed by the page cache - its essentially a bit
bucket. the i/o subsystem's efforts on behalf of such devices can be
precisely nil - bytes sent to them are never available for retrieval
unless the hardware itself does something funky.
and in the tight while() loops, the i/o subsystem doesn't even much a
role to play on the input-from-file side, since the data is all coming
out of memory which presumably is going to be resident after the first
iteration of both loops.
the unix everything-is-a-file model is great from an API point of
view, but it doesn't translate very well in kernel internals when many
"files" are not data storage devices in any sense.

no, we/i don't need it for disk i/o. we need it for output to an ADAC. 
i don't know where the locks are that i referred to above, but i know
that mingo and andrea and maybe even dave miller have confirmed their
existence when Benno first started discussing his latency test.
