  While you're adding this feature, and it seems others are adding
similar things, it is *highly* desirable to allow the build to put all
the dumps in one place of desired (my  first thought is /var/core) so
that if you get a lot you won't run the system out of disk.
  The directory name could be set in /proc/sys/coredir (or somesuch)
with an initial value of "." of course.
  Other than that I like the idea, although process "name" could get a
lot of clashes on threads, and pid gets reused. There may be a better
idea, but most of mine are cumbersome. This would really simplify
certain kinds of dump analysis.
