It is talking to a hypervisor.  This hypervisor does full 
virtualization, except that it allows the guest to hide eflags.IF inside 
eflags.AC as an optimization (otherwise you need to do binary 
translation to overcome popf silently disregarding IF on the stack).
You can regard eflags.AC as the paravirtualized eflags.IF (Xen for 
example has a per-vcpu memory flag for the same).
