Since 2.3.23 -> prepatch 25 (including 23) upon running 
gnome-terminal I receive the following error message:
Living environment not ok
Error: unable to fork: Connection reset by peer
...and then the program hangs with an open window, no shell.
Strangely both rxvt and xterm work just fine.
Gnome Terminal 1.0.39
Linux soren.internal 2.3.25 #14 Thu Oct 28 20:31:27 PDT 1999 i686 unknown
Of course this would seem to be gnome terminal related
giving the fact rxvt and xterm still both work fine.  Then
what changed to -stop- the seemingly working gnome-terminal
since 2.3.22?
Anyone else experience this?
