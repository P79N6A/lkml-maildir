Indeed. Any attempt to pretend otherwise has the same intellectual
rigour as security through obscurity.

No, no! <ls> should see a directory-based albod as a directory. Leave
it to the GIU file browser to present albods as "files".

GUI, GUI, GUI.
This is a user space problem. No kernel hooks or even libc hacks
needed. Remember there are two classes of users. Power users who will
want to get raw access. Then there are GUI lusers who want easy
access. A scheme which puts the hacks into a special library allows
both classes of user to be accommodated.
