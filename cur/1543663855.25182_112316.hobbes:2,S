Larry, how many times this kind of discussions went on during the last
years ? I think you should remember pretty well because it was always you
on that side of the river pushing back "Barbarians" with your UP sword.
The point is that people ( expecially young ) like to dig where other
failed, it's normal. It's attractive like honey for bears. Let them try,
many they will fail, but chances are that someone will succeed making it
worth the try. And trust Linus, that is more on your wavelength than on
the huge scalabity one.
