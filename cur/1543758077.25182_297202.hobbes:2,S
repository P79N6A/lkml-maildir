Sounds like a case is being made to make CONFIG_RCFS a "y" and eliminate
the possibility of it being a loadable module ? If so, I don't think its 
a good idea. While a kernel may have CKRM enabled, the user may choose 
not to use it. In such a case, he should have the option of not loading 
the rcfs module.
How does one restrict the choices of a tristate variable to exclude just 
the N selection ? It wasn't clear from the kconfig-language.txt...any 
pointers appreciated.
