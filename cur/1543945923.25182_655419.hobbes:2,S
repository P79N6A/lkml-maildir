that's an invalid excuse for the benefit of out-of-tree forks: reality 
is that you can export those functions in the "journal checksum patch" 
just fine. So you cannot 'nack' a sensible patch on that ground and no 
maintainer does it on that ground. Once you get your stuff upstream, you 
can re-add the export.
