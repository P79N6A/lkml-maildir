Hi,
I just gave it a try and the locking-up issue went worse with this 
kernel. Now even without APIC the kernel locks up quite fast on my 
nforce2. Very easy method (for me) was to copy a large file from CD-ROM 
(at least now mounting CDs works again, in contrast to mm2) to HD and 
machine locks-up. Sorry, no stack backtrace yet and no log entry, but 
I'll try to do what I can.
