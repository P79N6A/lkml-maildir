 Interesting.  I would consider ide-floppy (despite its somewhat
inadequate name) the driver for all ATAPI disks as opposed to ATA disks
that use ide-disk.  CD-like devices are much different, supporting such
alien to disk devices entities like tracks or audio reading or playing.
 BTW, does ide-cd support partition tables yet?  You typically want them
for MO disks if you want to transport data to/from other OSes or simply
because their space is big enough to create separate filesystems for
certain applications.  Or perhaps swap space even. ;-)

 Well, an exception rather than a rule. ;-)

 I see -- that's reasonable.  And I can't understand the proposed
inconsistency with drivers -- why it should be a CD when being an ATAPI
device and a disk when being a SCSI one?  After all SCSI has a separate
driver for CDs as well...
