Subject: [PATCH] apply type enum zone_type fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/6/56

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The variable 'k' was changed from 'int' to 'enum zone_type'
(unsigned), and it was being tested for being '>= 0' in a loop.
Result was that the set_mempolicy(MPOL_BIND) system call crashed
the kernel in a near infinite loop off into the weeds.
