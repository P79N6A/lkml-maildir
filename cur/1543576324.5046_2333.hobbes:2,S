Data reserved by your system for whatever purpose.
Most probably ACPI data or similar.

If you would have ACPI events, you would probably run into trouble.
Apart from this, chances are that the reserved data is not needed by Linux
and never accessed by the BIOS, so you may get away with using the reserved
memory.
The safe way is to respect the BIOS' RAM map.
