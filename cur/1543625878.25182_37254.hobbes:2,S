For the first way of doing I already provided a patch, which started this 
thread.  (returning the release() value proparly to the close())
However if I get a word from the applicate maintaners (linus or viro) that  a 
patch declaring release() with void return type will be accepted for 2.5.x, I 
would volunteer for providing it. Should not be that much of a work, once you 
concentrate on it. However I'm not doing it for the birds :o)  (without 
consultation first). 
Personlaly I'm unsure which of both decisions would be better, but am 
unsatisfied with the way it's currently.
