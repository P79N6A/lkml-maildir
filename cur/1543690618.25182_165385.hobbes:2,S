Yes, I just tested this patch, and everything seems to work fine. Thank
you. :)
The only point I see, which is not triggered on my machine (because of
the absence of ACPI) is this one :
There is also an initialization of this mp_irqs variable in
mp_config_acpi_legacy_irqs from mpparse.c. It only seems to be called
from within acpi_boot_init in acpi.c. So I wonder if it's possible that
we do use default configuration and then also go into
mp_config_acpi_legacy_irqs during the acpi init, thus reserving the
memory twice and forgetting the old pointer, which could lead to an
erratic result.
If it's possible, then there is still a problem in there.
