   i assume the mtu is ethernet 1500 Bytes, right? and that mss should be
   something much bigger than mtu, which gives the performance improvement
   shown in the numbers.
The performance improvement comes from the fact that the card
is given huge 64K packets, then the card (using the given ip/tcp
headers as a template) spits out 1500 byte mtu sized packets.
Less data DMA'd to the device per normal-mtu packet and less
per-packet data structure work by the cpu is where the improvement
comes from.
