I am fine with "You have to use initrd (or similiar) _if_ you want this
feature."
But please don't make initrd mandatory for those of us who don't
need ACPI, don't need dhcp before mounting disks and so on.
I hope the "fs-less" kernel image still will be possible for those
of us who have a simple setup.
