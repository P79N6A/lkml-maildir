In 2.2.x we were able to build a kernel with RAID modules and have it 
autodetect RAID partitions at boot time - so we could use raid root partitions.
In 2.40 the configuration option CONFIG_AUTODETECT_RAID is explicitly disabled 
unless at least one RAID module is built into the kernel.  I presume there is 
a good reason for this and that it's not just a mistake.
Are there any plans to re-enable this feature?  It would be nice to be able to 
have a single kernel for all our machines without having to have RAID in the 
kernel when it isn't needed.
