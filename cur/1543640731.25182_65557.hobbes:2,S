Yep, the integer overflow resulted in an incorrectly computed
loops_per_jiffy :
Aug 21 19:50:41 titane kernel: adjust_jiffies: prechange cur=667000, new=800000
Aug 21 19:50:41 titane kernel: old loop_per_jiffy = 665.19 (cpufreq_ref_loops=3325952, cpufreq_ref_freq=667000).
Aug 21 19:50:41 titane kernel: new loop_per_jiffy = 669.02 (cpufreq_ref_loops=3325952, cpufreq_ref_freq=667000).
With the patch applied, it work fine :
Aug 22 11:33:40 titane kernel: adjust_jiffies: prechange cur=667000, new=800000
Aug 22 11:33:40 titane kernel: old loop_per_jiffy = 665.19 (cpufreq_ref_loops=3325952, cpufreq_ref_freq=667000).
Aug 22 11:33:40 titane kernel: new loop_per_jiffy = 797.82 (cpufreq_ref_loops=3325952, cpufreq_ref_freq=667000).
