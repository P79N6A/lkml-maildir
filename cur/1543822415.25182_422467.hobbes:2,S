Iirc, he tried that, though it did bloat the kernel size a bit due the
the amount of occurences of current-> in there. We are now thinking
about either dedicating a register to current (that would avoid the
problem of printk() using it in start_kernel before we get the per-cpu
areas setup) in addition to __thread (heh, we have lots of registers on
ppc :) or maybe putting current back in the paca...
It's a bit sad that we can't get rid of the PACA because it has to be in
the RMA (for those who don't know that it is, the RMA is an area of
memory that is accessible in real mode on LPAR machines, that is the
hypervisor guarantees a bunch of physically contiguous memory that is
made accessible to the partition for use in real mode). We could have
put the per-cpu infos in the RMA but I'm a bit freaked out by the idea
of having those not be node-local...
Ben.
