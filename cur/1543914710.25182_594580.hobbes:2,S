they can. Put technical issues infront of everything also see the
whole picture that userspace tv applications have to support
all the codecs which are available.

there was not a single developer of the old crufted developers who
didn't bring the project forward during the last 2 years.
yes you're right.

it gets me thinking. Some core developers who I met during
the last few weeks (kernel summit, suse conference in czech)
told me to go on with it actually because the final plan isn't that
bad.. I don't expect anyone of the old crufted v4l/dvb (well many
of them already left the party) will join the game...
(I'll leave that open here) spend some time read the whole history
of this thread and it will show up what this all is targeting at.
I'll answer your questions with technical reasons why I'm doing
all that stuff that way if you'll just ask.
Someone told me during the last 2 weeks
 "but v4l2 was about to solve all those problems" it didn't. (point)
and I think I explained good enough why all that crap still goes
on as it is.
Beside that I'm just curious how much did you contribute
during the last 2 years to the lkml/linux kernel, and how much
do you want to contribute in future? (also from my side
talk is cheap (even for me) but getting something done costs
quite some time and feedback from other people)
