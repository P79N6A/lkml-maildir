	This is false and is nowhere found in the standard.

	Where are you getting this from? Nothing requires the scheduler to schedule
any threads when the mutex is released.
	All that must happen is that the mutex must be unlocked. The scheduler is
permitted to allow any thread it wants to run at that point, or no thread.
Nothing says the thread that released the mutex can't continue running and
nothing says that it can't call pthread_mutex_lock and re-acquire the mutex
before any other thread gets around to getting it.
	In general, it is very bad karma for the scheduler to stop a thread before
its timeslice is up if it doesn't have to. Consider one CPU and two threads,
each needing to do 100 quick lock/unlock cycles. Why force 200 context
switches?
