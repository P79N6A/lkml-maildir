Are you using ahci or ata_piix? It seem that people have success with AHCI but 
not with ata_piix. 
My ThinkPad Z60m has
00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801FBM (ICH6M) SATA Controller (rev 
03)
which afaik is AHCI capable but only if BIOS initializes it in ahci mode ;-/
Unfortunately there is no such option in BIOS (I've checked latest available 
bios - 1.14).
Is it possible to initialize this controller in AHCI mode by Linux itself 
without BIOS help? (where possible means ,,possible but not implemented'', 
too)
