I know, and I have no idea why I'm not.

Thanks, I'll look into it.

But what could be the reason? I'm really out of ideas.
The only thing I can think off is the 66/64 PCI bus and the
disadvantageous placement of the PCI cards, but neither should cause a
higher CPU usage. If the bus couldn't keep up, I'd get packetloss.
