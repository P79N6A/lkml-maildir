If you control the whole system, the ideal way is to have the system
firmware or boot loader come with the firmware blob and avoid worrying
about it in linux entirely. E.g. if you are using Open Firmware, you
can have the binary image as a property of the device in your device
tree, where Linux then goes looking for it.
