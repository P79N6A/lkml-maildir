Hi,
in general the code looks clean; great job on that.
A few suggestions and comments to hopefully help this driver to become
even better:
First of all, I'm a little concerned about the lack of locking that
this driver seems to have; what guarantees the integrity of the lists
used in the driver?
Second, you have a lot of use of likely() and unlikely(); so much that I think it's waaaay overkill. The code it's in generally isn't hotpath, and gcc also does a pretty decent job without giving these hints in general.

for example this list.. what makes sure that no 2 pieces of code muck with it at the same time?

this unlikely isn't needed; gcc basically assumes that NULL pointer checks are unlikely anyway...

this is I think a small bug; it is for sure unsafe against jiffies wrapping... please consider using the time_before() and time_after() helpers which will make this comparison safe wrt jiffies wrapping. The same is true for all other jiffies use in the driver...

I wonder if you want to at least check if the work was really for you before returning IRQ_HANDLED....
