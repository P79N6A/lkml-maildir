Greg, can you be sure this fix makes it upstream for 2.6.15?
With this patch applied, this laptop (a Toshiba Satellite M45 class box) 
and Linux get along pretty well.  All the hardware, save the TI SD chip, 
is supported by Linux drivers (i9xx for graphics, ipw2200 wireless, sky2 
ethernet, etc.).  I'm pretty happy with it.
Thanks,
Jesse
