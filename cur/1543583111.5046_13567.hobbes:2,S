In kernel version 2.4.x (x from 0 to 2-ac3), the
smc-mca driver gives many errors like the following on
the console log:
io mapaddr 0xXXXXX not valid at smc-mca.c:YYY!
where XXXXX is an address within the shared-memory
assigned to the adapter card, and YYY is 378, 398 or
408.
I have tested the driver on two IBM MCA systems - a
9577 and an 8590. I have tried three different network
adapters in each machine:
WD Ethercard PLUS 10T/A (WD8003W/A)
SMC Ethercard PLUS Elite/A BNC/AUI (WD8013EP/A)
SMC Ethercard PLUS Elite/A UTP/AUI (WD8013WP/A)
All the adapters give the errors, in both machines.
All adapters and both PS/2s are known to be good with
kernel 2.2.17.
