The problem is not that reading the disk is slow, it's that it brings the
system to its knees. There are many valid scenarios where non-root users
should be able to put CDs in a machine and they shouldn't be able to DoS
it by doing so.
Fact is the SCSI layer's error handling has been on the list of things in
dire need of replacement for years and this is one of the many symptoms.
