When you start merging DRM and fbdev you will be able to use relative
paths that are closer together.  For example #include
"../char/drm/drmP.h" versus "#include "drm/drmP.h" for internal
headers.
DRM and fbdev need to be moved next to each other in kconfig too if
they start depending on each other. It if hard to figure out that a
video option might not be visible because the char/drm/option is not
turned on.
