It's everywhere in the DIO submit and completion path, here is a profile
taken on a recent measurement:
                        Rank   %
__blockdev_direct_IO    9      3.09%
dio_bio_end_io          12     2.13%
dio_bio_complete        19     0.95%
finished_one_bio        34     0.55%
dio_get_page            76     0.22%
dio_bio_submit          96     0.19%
dio_bio_add_page       101     0.17%
dio_complete           115     0.16%
dio_new_bio            125     0.14%
dio_send_cur_page      150     0.10%
dio_bio_end_aio        201     0.06%
The compiler inlines direct_io_worker into __blockdev_direct_IO, so that
function showed up at the top.  The "rank" field indicates hotness of a
function, i.e., rank 1 is the hottest function. The "%" field is % clock
ticks for the respective function.
Looking at this profile, I see that the submit path is clearly heavy
weight. dio_bio_end_io maybe a bit skewed because of wake-up function
called inside spin_lock_irqsave().  The profiler is not capable of
measuring accurate clock ticks with code running inside irq off section.
Everything is accumulated at the time when irq is enabled.
