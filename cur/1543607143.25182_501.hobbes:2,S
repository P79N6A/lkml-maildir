Comments along the lines of "move somewhere else" certainly seem to imply
such.
Rik van Riel in particular has said many things along those lines; "That's
tough, they're a democratic country, they can change the law if it hurts
them too much." Of course, that statement is completely untrue. We are
neither a democracy, nor do individuals without very much money have the
power to change laws. Which also precludes moving to a different country.
