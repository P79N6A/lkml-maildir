Hi,
I just combined the 4 page fault handler events that were in the tracing
hot path of LTTng into 2 :
kernel page_fault_entry
kernel page_fault_exit
They take as parameter the combination of what was available in the
trap_entry/exit events and handle_mm_fault entry/exit events. This
should lessen the performance impact of the tracer when it's active.
I did the related modifications in LTTV 0.12.8.
Mathieu
