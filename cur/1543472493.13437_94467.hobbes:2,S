Subject: update/bdflush stall's pine/disk_IO while flushing ?

Hello,
I noticed to many times my pine will block while reading Email (such as
kernel-digest, which becommes huge), and bdflush gets active. With vmstat
i see then a huge raise in io/bo, and when i try to scroll trough the
Email message, pine just waits and waits, about 10 or more seconds.
typical mem usage: about 30MB free ram (total of 256MB), no swap used.
After i killed bdflush/update, i never noticed it again, not even when
typing 'sync' (perhaps i should try harder...)
So i assume bdflush/update is _locking_ the disk while doing a flush,
am i right here?
Ideas for the exact cause ?
Is it possible to view what data, or from which process is written/read
from/to disk ?
System info:
/sbin/update is started at boot time, no options.
RAM: 256MB
DISKS: 3x IDE Quantum FB (2x 2GB,1x 6GB)
Sysload: unloaded
Kernel: 2.1.131-ac13, but noticed with prior (2.1.xx) also, don't know
        about 2.0.xx.
Pleace CC me, only on kernel-digest.

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
