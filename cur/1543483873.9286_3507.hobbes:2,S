Hello,
Does anyone know why uname always returns "unknown" for the (yp)domainname?
Every Linux system that I have ever built or booted seems to provide all
the information except the domainname, regardless of whether it is or isn't
set.  For example:
% ypdomainname ;uname -a
main
Linux terror 2.0.33 #6 Tue Aug 25 16:55:08 PDT 1998 i586 unknown
% 
% ypdomainname ;uname -a
Linux earth 2.2.0-final #15 Thu Jan 21 09:57:07 PST 1999 alpha unknown
% 
I've tried with the latest sh-utils I could find, but perhaps I have done
something wrong?  Or, is this a kernel issue?
thanks,
-bp
