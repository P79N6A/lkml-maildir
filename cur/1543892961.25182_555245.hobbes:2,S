To build an external module you need to point to a directory
where a fully build kernel is placed.
You could do a full build and then a "make clean",
this would still let you build external modules.
In your case the kernel was not build.
And to build modpost you need to execute "make modules" from
the kernel top-level directory.

Anything that is available public?
Could take a quick look at the Makefile +
build instructions.
