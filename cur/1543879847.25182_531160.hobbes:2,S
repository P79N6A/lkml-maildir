thanks for testing this! Indeed the min-max values and standard 
deviation look all pretty healthy. (They in fact seem to be better than 
the other patch of mine against upstream that you tested, correct?)
[ And there's also another nice little detail in your feedback: CFS
  actually builds, boots and works fine on ia64 too ;-) ]
