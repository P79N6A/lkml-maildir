You didn't provide enough information for anybody to have a single idea
about the cause of the problem you report, in my opinion.
Just any not too old 10,000 RPM disk is able to sustain more that 25 MB/s
sequential data transfer, but cannot do better than 5 milli-seconds
latency with random IO patterns. So, result for 100 MB transfer can be
less than 4 seconds in the best case but greater than (25000*5)/1000=125
seconds for random 4K IO pattern, for example.
What you want to do, in my opinion, could be:
- Check in the syslog the actual transfer speed that has been negotiated
  for your SCSI disk.
- Also check if error messages related to disk IOs have been reported by 
  the kernel.
- Run some benchmark to check, at least, sequential IO performance (iozone
  for example will fit)
