Depends which kernel version.. <= 2.4.9, you can use IKD, which
contains Ingo's memleak detector.  Sadly, it's unmaintained atm.
See /pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/ikd of your favorite mirror
to see if there's a canned version that fits your needs.  (If not,
it's likely easier to rip memleak out of ikd and hand patch than
to try fixing the zillion rejects you'd have if you try to wedge
ikd into a recent tree:)
