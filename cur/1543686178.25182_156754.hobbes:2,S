I'm running Debian unstable here but I do not have anything special on that
file, just the defaults changing the driver into yenta_socket, and even this
is not necesary if you happen to have just yenta compiled.
# Defaults for pcmcia (sourced by /etc/init.d/pcmcia)
PCMCIA=yes
PCIC=yenta_socket
PCIC_OPTS=
CORE_OPTS=
CARDMGR_OPTS=
