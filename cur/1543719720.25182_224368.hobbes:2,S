I did an experiment with updating an unsigned short
via a cast-as-lvalue to unsigned char, and gcc did
in fact implement the temp + copy semantics you
describe above. That is,
	unsigned short x = 0xaafe;
	((unsigned char)x)++;
resulted in x == 0x00ff.
So cast-as-lvalue is at least reasonably correctly
implemented in gcc.
Whether it's useful and portable is a another matter :-)
