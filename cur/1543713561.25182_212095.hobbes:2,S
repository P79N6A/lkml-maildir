I've been trying to work out what goes wrong in mark_offset_tsc() and 
found that it's just the outb_p() & inb_p() calls that are causing the 
problem. I found a thread relating to this, 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.2/1039.html,
 and 
tried the line:
#define __SLOW_DOWN_IO__ ""
which also allowed usb to work normally. Since this is just avoiding the 
read or write to port 0x80, is this a sign of having dodgy hardware? The 
thread doesn't talk about writing to the port as being fatal, even if it 
does cause problems for some people.
Anybody got a better fix?
Malcolm.
