# The same thing can be conceptually used to create that wet dream of user
# mounts: going "inside" tar-files by just mounting them as a
# mini-filesystem on top of the file that is the tar archive. The strongest
# argument against that is probably the fact that "tar" is not that great a
# filesystem format ;)
This is one of the things I liked about Windows 95's Powertoys - it came
with a utility which let you treat a .CAB (Microsoft's zip/tar
replacement - goodness knows why the existing formats weren't adequate) -
as a directory, from the user perspective. Worked neatly, although it was
read-only - but for the most part, that was all you needed (a nice method
for extracting files from an archive).
Being able to do..
$ cp files.tar.gz/docs/mydoc1.txt .
Would be useful.
Being able to do..
$ cp mydoc1.txt files.tar.gz/docs/
Would be nice, but would be a pain to implement (and probably as slow as
hell).
If 'tarfs' was ever implemented, I could see it being a read-only
filesystem, for precisely this reason.
