Hi,
I had the same problem as Marc. I have AWLL3026. I followed the installation
instructions in the web site  
http://zd1211.ath.cx/
 but the network is not
working yet. I am connected wirelessly to a router that connects me to the
internet and the internet is not working. That's how I knew that the network
is not working. 
Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks,
Mohamed Rabie
