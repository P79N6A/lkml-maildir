This is a more specific follow up to an earlier, still unsolved, question.
Kernel: 2.2.9-ac[14] and 2.2.5
Hardware: Dell keyboard, FIC-2013, K6-II/333 at 333, 128MB ECC SDRAM
Problem: Console keyboard occasionally acts as though shift, ctrl, or alt
	is being held down when it's not. Seen in text console
	and X. Repeatedly tapping the offending key usually clears up the
	problem. I can't reproduce the problem at will.
Attempted solutions: new keyboard, new motherboard, new kernel versions,
	disabling all APM in BIOS and kernel.
My question now is how to debug further. /proc/interrupts tells me that
the kernel sees keystrokes (twice as many interrupts per tap for
right-hand alt and ctrl - should that be?).
Is there any way to ask the kernel what it thinks the state of the
keyboard is? I know C, but not kernel internals.
Eric
