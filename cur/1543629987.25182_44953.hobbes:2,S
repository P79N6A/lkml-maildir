Good day, all,
	As part of a project that needs to log all keystrokes and screen 
output traveling over a pty, we have produced a patch to the stock linux 
kernel that does so.  It is designed to function in a UML environment to 
allow logging UML sessions out to the host.
	Please understand, we _do_ _not_ consider this, at _any_ level, to 
be appropriate for including in _any_ kernel tree.  We are providing it 
here to satisfy our requirements under the GPL and for those who might be 
interested.  Any arguments that this is too ugly to live will be met with 
vehement agreement.  :-)
	The permanent location for the patch is:  
http://www.stearns.org/patches/
 .  The current name is 
2.4.19-uml-logging-patch .
	The work was accomplished by a well known UML kernel programmer 
who would prefer to not be associated with such a hack.  :-)  It is 
Copyright 2002 <jdike@karaya.com> and was funded by the Institute for 
Security Technology Studies.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
