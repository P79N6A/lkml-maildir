Some people might define 'realtime' to mean fast, but, as far as an
OS is concerned, it means that process time slices and kernel 
activities occur in predictable, repeatable amount of time.
Just because an OS is fast enough to deal with the problem at hand
does not mean that you can guarantee that this will always be
repeatable.  You just don't get any guarantees of the upper limit
of time that something will take.
