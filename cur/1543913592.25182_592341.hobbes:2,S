Subject: In search of 10gbps cards/shootout in Linux?

There are various agencies/educational institutions doing testing but was 
curious if anyone has 'found' a 10 gigabit card shootout measuring the 
performance between 10 gigabit cards on the 2.6 kernel?  Most of the 
benchmarks are from the vendors themselves Intel/etc-- was wondering if 
there were any vendor-independent benchmarks out there?
Until switches come down in price, 10gbps will be most relegated to 
business/research use and therefore such benchmarks probably will be hard 
to come by but I thought I'd ask..
Thanks,
Justin.
