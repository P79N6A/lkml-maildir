And if there were a dataflow between addr/port a.b to addr/port c.d
already, it will either terminated?
Considering the following sequence:
handlers->t3c_handlers->sched()->work_queue->work_handlers()->for
example CPL_PASS_ACCEPT_REQ->pass_accept_req() - it just parses incoming
skb and sets port/addr/route and other fields to be used as a base for rdma
connection. What if it just a usual network packet from kernelspace or 
userspace with the same payload as should be sent by remote rdma system?
