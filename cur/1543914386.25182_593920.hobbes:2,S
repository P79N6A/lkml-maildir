Ok, after conferring with Oliver this morning, I think the best solution
here is to both revert the usb-storage suspend patch as it has some
basic problems that can cause data loss, _and_ add the change to the
kernel that by default disables autosuspend on all USB devices except
hubs.
If anyone has any objections to this, please let me know.
