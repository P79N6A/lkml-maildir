This might work.

I don't know about this.  The local-out hook always had a fully
functional finalized packet to work with, and I doubt we should change
that.
Also, dst_output() might invoke IPSEC encapsulators which absolutely
must have the final packet in hand when they run (f.e. you can't
choose the IP ID after encryption of the IP header).
Anyways, that leaves us with the helper function idea, does this
(untested) look like what you want?
