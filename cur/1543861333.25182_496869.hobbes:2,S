yes, yes, yes - lets please do that! The process freezer is already used 
for suspend, for hibernate and recently for kprobes - so its performance 
and robustness is being relied on and verified from multiple angles. I 
can see no reason why it couldnt be made really fast even on large 
boxes, if the need arises. (but even the current one is fast enough for 
any human-driven CPU hotplug stuff)
