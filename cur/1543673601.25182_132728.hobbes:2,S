Your arguments for swap wiping in the kernel aren't making sense.
It's the distribution that must be made secure, not just the kernel.
And a secure distribution wouldn't nuke its own version of swapoff.
Of course, as others have already noted, you really want encrypted
swap rather than swap wiping at shutdown time.
