Sorry for the late hit (I've been on vacation) but, would it be
worthwhile to add HZ to a file in /proc, e.g. /proc/sys/kernel/hz?  One
could then patch and recompile pstools (and possibly things like games
that might care) to read the value.  Indeed, one could even permit the
value to be set via the proc point and let people retune from coarse to
ultra-fine as CPU speeds and the like continue to increase.
Just an opinion, but a solution that is properly integrated and is
scalable in the future seems preferable to just altering the #define.
