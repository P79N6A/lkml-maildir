Just to be clear here, not everyone is comfortable
with the idea of a security "policy" that is
developed,
maintained, and stored independently of the kernel
and the applications to which it is applied.
The SELinux approach took a good deal of selling
within the community before it gained traction,
and a good many of the voices I've heard today
spoke out against SELinux in the beginning. It is
still far from universally regarded as the ultimate
solution.

Perhaps. The SELinux community has made significant
contributions to the LSM effort might be a more
politic way to say it, but in the end the changes
made by the SELinux community were done for the
benefit of SELinux. This is only natural and to be
expected.

Yes, I remember it well. The Bumper Patch of Fun
and the resulting Bruhaha over authoritative hooks
will feature prominently in my tell-all book.

Now that's just not true. Crispin was very active in
the very early days. He didn't always get what he
wanted, but he certainly asked for it many times.

I am sure that LSM, being a community effort, can
evolve over time for AppArmour just as it has for
SELinux and any other user that invests (that's a
key) in the effort. SELinux has provided the lion's
share of value to LSM over the past couple years.
It is both appropriate and to be expected that LSM
has lost much of its independence from SELinux
under such circumstances.

It is well known that I am far from convinced
that the policy file basis of SELinux is sound.
Many people of demonstrated intelligence think
it is. Personally, I suspect that both Stephen
and Crispin are smarter than I am, and I believe
that both have value to add to the community with
the approaches they've developed. The same goes
for LIDS, LOMAX, other projects I've seen but
may not name.
Let's not chicken out. Linux is too young to get
stodgy.
