Sounds quite sensible. Minimal bloat, can just forget about it if you don't
want to use it at all.
Security implications worry me: When a new device shows up, the devd starts
some proggie to configure it (permissions, ifconfig, whatever). This will
be a program with root privilege, or at least device creating/configuring
capability. OK, whom is this GUI (Big mess! Hard to audit!) program going
to contact? Current user at the console, only user on the machine (some
vermin over the net, perhaps), wait for root to show up? Might be OK for a
personal, non-networked machine. For a server it is out, AFAIKS. And then a
substantial chunk of the proposed functionality is lost.
