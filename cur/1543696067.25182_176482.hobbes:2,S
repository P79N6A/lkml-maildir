Please clarify: does the kernel with local APIC support enabled always
fail to boot, or does it only fail at warm (re)boots?
What exact kernel version are you using? A bug which had the effect
of breaking warm (re)boots on some system was fixed semi-recently.
(Power-management related config options are also significant.
Certain APM options are known to cause problems, for instance.)
Note that many many laptops have buggy BIOSen, making local APIC
usage on those laptops impossible. Pass "nolapic" to the kernel if
you have a buggy machine.
