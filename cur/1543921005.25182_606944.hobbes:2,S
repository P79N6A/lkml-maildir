The point is that apps usually require a "Master" volume.  If it's the
single volume control, it's better to call it master for convenience.

Yes, 9200 doesn't call stac92xx_auto_create_hp_ctls(), so it's not
affected.

Both are handled as patch_stac925x.  That's what I meant.  With your
patch, there will be no master any more.
So, how about the patch below?
