Just remember that the allowance of proprietary device driver kernel
modules is a special exception to the licensing of the kernel, not the
rule.  And some days even this exception becomes close to regrettable.
Other people seem to appreciate when the GPL camp isn't telling them
how to license their own code.  And just as fairly it'd be nice if
people didn't tell us what to do with the licensing of the Linux
sources.
(I'm not a "use opensource or you're a maggot" person, I just choose
 to not assosciate myself with sources not using that kind of
 licensing.  Linux is one of those safe havens for myself and
 others.  How would you like it if I were to jeapordize your own
 legitimate paradise?).
