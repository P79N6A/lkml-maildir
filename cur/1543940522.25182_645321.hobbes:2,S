iSER has parameters to limit the maximum size of RDMA (it needs to
repeat RDMA with a poor configuration)?
Anyway, here's the results from Robin Humble:
iSER to 7G ramfs, x86_64, centos4.6, 2.6.22 kernels, git tgtd,
initiator end booted with mem=512M, target with 8G ram
 direct i/o dd
  write/read  800/751 MB/s
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1M count=5000 oflag=direct
    dd of=/dev/null if=/dev/sdc bs=1M count=5000 iflag=direct

I think that STGT is pretty fast with the fast backing storage. 
I don't think that there is the notable perfornace difference between
kernel-space and user-space SRP (or ISER) implementations about moving
data between hosts. IB is expected to enable user-space applications
to move data between hosts quickly (if not, what can IB provide us?).
I think that the question is how fast user-space applications can do
I/Os ccompared with I/Os in kernel space. STGT is eager for the advent
of good asynchronous I/O and event notification interfances.
One more possible optimization for STGT is zero-copy data
transfer. STGT uses pre-registered buffers and move data between page
cache and thsse buffers, and then does RDMA transfer. If we implement
own caching mechanism to use pre-registered buffers directly with (AIO
and O_DIRECT), then STGT can move data without data copies.
