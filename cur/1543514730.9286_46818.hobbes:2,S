that was a rhetorical question :)
I understand what report you are talking about - I just wanted to say that
my bug report has nothing to do with any human-readable reports (well,
ignoring the early version of my report which did say something about
"Memory..." lines but that is long forgotten after I mentioned
/proc/kcore)
Regards,
Tigran.
