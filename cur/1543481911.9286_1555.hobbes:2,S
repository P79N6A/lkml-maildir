I am considering upgrading to 2.2.0 in a few days. The CHANGES file has
done a great job at scaring me.
I use this machine as an IPMasqurading router. According to the ChangeLog,
ipfwadm will break. :(. That stinks. I'll have to upgrade to IPChains, but
the site appars to be down.
I don't see an IP: Masqurading option in the kernel anymore. What happened
to that? Is it unnecesary with IPChains?
I also have not been able to find port forwarding patches to 2.1.xxx or
2.2.x. Will these ever be brought back up to sync with 2.2?
