Normally I would too, but I'm still hoping I could do a 2.6.14 tonight. I 
guess that's unreasonable (swtlb issues etc), but for now I just committed 
the one-liner.

Yes. I did something broken like that before Dipankar pointed me at 
batching.
The only downside to TIF_RCUUPDATE is that those damn TIF-flags are 
per-architecture (probably largely unnecessary, but while most 
architectures don't care at all, others seem to have optimized their 
layout so that they can test the work bits more efficiently). So it's a 
matter of each architecture being updated with its TIF_xyz flag and their 
work function.
Anybody willing to try? Dipankar apparently has a lot on his plate, this 
_should_ be fairly straightforward. Eric?
