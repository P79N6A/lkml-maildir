Hmmm. My code didn't do any locking, therefore I don't know
how to, as you say "drop the lock", except how other kernel drivers
do it. If I had any semaphores (which I don't here), or spin-locks
(which I don't), I could certainly unlock anything my code locked.
However, the kernel did something before my code was called.
Therefore, I have no way of undoing it except by calling
unlock_kernel().
Is there some other way?
