Type atomic_t is an integer that can be accessed in memory
with an uninterruptible instruction. This limits the atomic_t
type in 32-bit machines to 32-bits, in 64-bit machines to 64-bits,
etc. It has nothing to do with wrap-around. If you increment
0xffffffff it becomes 0 even it it's an atomic type.
In an ISR, the code won't be interrupted until you enable interrupts,
which you shouldn't do anyway. This means that even non-atomic types
are safe, even in SMP machines if the increment is after a spin-lock.
So, you can use 'long long' types for interrupt counters and no
information will be lost until you wrap 0xffffffffffffffff, which
will take quite some time. The problem remains, however, in
reading this value. You need to either read it under a spinlock
or read several times until you get the same value twice in a row.
Spin-locks are easier.
