On sparc64 I'm getting:
  CC      arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.o
In file included from include/linux/compat.h:16,
                 from arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.c:12:
include/asm/signal.h:177: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'compat_sigset_t'
AFAICS this is defined in include/linux/compat.h, which is included by
signal.c only if CONFIG_SPARC32_COMPAT is defined (yep, that's a 'y' in my
.configure), but is included again in signal.h. This also looks broken to me.
I can't see what the compiler is complaining about (gcc-4.1.1-14.sparc on
Aurora Corona), as this is a typedef for a struct.
