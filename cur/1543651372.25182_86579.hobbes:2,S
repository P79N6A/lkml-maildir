Subject: dell inspiron losing time - regression in 2.5

I know this question has been asked here before, but I think some
electrons went missing from google when I checked.
I have a dell inpiron 4000 - and I just started using 2.5.
Under 2.4, the clock was rock-steady. But under 2.5, I am losing about 700
seconds a day - ntp can't even fix that. I have seen this behaviour before
with others - and they resort to turning off the battery monitor.
But I am wondering why this is only under 2.5 for me? I get a message at
bootup:
"Dell Inspiron machine detected. Enabling interrupts during APM calls."
I don't ever recall getting that in 2.4 - I have config set up with "Dell
laptop support" on and "Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls" turned off
- just as I had it under 2.4.
So what has changed?
