Any updated information one should know about this before testing?
I'm getting bad pmds in 2.6.11.5; Tyan S2882/dual AMD 246 opterons. The
problem only occurs when doing some thread intensive task. I'm going to
try and strace/bt and send some information as it occurs. Hardware is
almost identical to the setup above.
