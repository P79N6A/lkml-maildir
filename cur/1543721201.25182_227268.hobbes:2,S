You know, I've never understood why people hate ioctl.  Sometimes, it
really is what you want.  Why impose structured data onto a 2-way
unstructred system (read/write) when you have a structured system at hand
(ioctl).
I like ioctl() when it makes sense.  read() and write() are for data.
ioctl is for (tada!) control.
