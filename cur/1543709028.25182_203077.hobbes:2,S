Fabio,
I think this failure is from something else in -mm besides ACPI.
Otherwise, 2.6.4-rc1 wouldn't be working for you -- because 2.6.4
includes the ACPI patch you were running when you first hit this.
>I've also tried 2.6.4-rc1 and 2.6.4-rc1-mm1: 2.6.4-rc1 boots 
>and works, -mm1 hang at the very same point.
To verify with the latest software, please apply the latest ACPI patch
to 2.6.4-rc1:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/
2.6.4/acpi-20040220-2.6.4.diff.gz
If it works, then something else in -mm is causing your problem.  If it
fails, then something in the latest ACPI patch (which is included in
-mm1) is causing the failure.
Thanks,
-Len
