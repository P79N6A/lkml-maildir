When I try to "standby" (echo standby > /sys/power/state)
a 2.6.14 system running on a VIA C3-based system with VIA
chipset (suspend to disk never worked on this system --
as stated on swsusp website it's due to the lack of some
CPU instruction on this CPU [but winXP suspends to disk
on this system just fine]), it immediately comes back, with
the above error message:
Stopping tasks: =====================================================================|
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:07.5 disabled
Could not suspend device 0000:00:07.3: error -22

Some devices failed to suspend

Here's the PCI devices:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8601 [Apollo ProMedia] (rev 05)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8601 [Apollo ProMedia AGP]
00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super South] (rev 40)
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)

00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Trident Microsystems CyberBlade/i1 (rev 6a)
(note it's the second USB interface which fails).
And here's the USB device list:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 07cc:0301 Carry Computer Eng., Co., Ltd 6-in-1 Card Reader
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0458:0036 KYE Systems Corp. (Mouse Systems)
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
This machine was never able to go to standby mode completely - before
2.6.14, it performed resume after several secounds of sleeping.  Now
it does not even try to sleep anymore.
Also, "suspend to mem" does just nothing, -- the same as "suspend to disk"
(but for disk, it never worked at all as stated above).
Any hints on where to look at?
Thanks.
