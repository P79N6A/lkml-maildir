As I´ve read related to bcast2000/Bt848, the 3com 3c905[A|B|C]-TX is very
broken, too (high latency on PCI bus disturbing framegrabbing using Bt848).
Now I changed from 3com to eepro100 and I have system crashes or transmit
timeouts.
Are there any recommendations on which currently available 100MBit Ethernet
Adapter to use? 
Thanx in advance.
