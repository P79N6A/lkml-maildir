The BKL is dropped whenever the task voluntarily blocks in the kernel.
This is what you are seeing reported here.  It will be reacquired when
the task is rescheduled:

The latency measuring code isn't always accurate in reporting the cause
in this case: if it's unlocked by unlock_kernel and locked in sched.c,
then it's the reacqusition of the BKL by a task that was blocked while
holding the lock.
