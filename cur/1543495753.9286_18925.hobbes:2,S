Are you sure?
I got my SMP box hanging in processes writing to disk (one of which was rm),
spending 200% CPU in system. Some processes were in D state.
Removing this patch cured the problem. 
As opposed to what Christian Balzer reports, I can't get my system hanging
just doing some bonnies, now.
I'll reapply the patch and reproduce the problem, if you want to debug it ...
