[compression swap is good because compression has better bandwith
 than disk, and this will improve further in the future]
I can agree with that - but I see another problem.  You can't
get that much extra space from compression.  A disk is so big
that it will hold "enough" swap - i.e. so much that you never
want to get into using it all.
No matter how much memory you have - you are out of it when
swapping/paging starts.  Compressed pages in RAM won't buy you much,
arbitrary data tend to compress not much more than 2x.  
So it won't be long before you have to write to disk anyway.
The compressed swap in RAM will help in those situations where
you are using only a little too much, so everything will fit in
RAM.  This advantage is offset by the fact that you now have less
RAM as some of it is reserved for compressed swap.
