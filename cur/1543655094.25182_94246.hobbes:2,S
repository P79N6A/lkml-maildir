Being curious, I was wondering, since we're not changing much in kernel core, 
and developement implies adding additional code and layers for security, 
enhancements and support for further hardware and etc.
Does this not slow down the kernel ? or is the execution code still the same 
??
How does kernel optimization take place ? does it take place at all ??
I can hardly see optimization taking place, if one doesn't modify the old 
code, and chunks of kernel.
