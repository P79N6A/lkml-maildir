   >Why?
   Because when you'll enter the memset in the idle task you won't exit it in
   the middle even if somebody sent you a reschedule interrupt. The increased
   scheduler latency while rescheduling the idle task will be close to the
   time of a memset/2 (if the pool was empty).
No, as Victor has stated you don't call standard memset, you inline
code it in the architecture specific idle loop and there you can
check need_resched in between every store instruction if you feel
it necessary.
