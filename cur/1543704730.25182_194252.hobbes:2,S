Yes. Also IBM's laptop hard disk space is too expensive, so I have presented
to myself T41 with only 40GB (5400rpm) HDD, keeping a great hope that it will
look like 60GB (7200!) after enabling transparent compression in reiser4  ;)
Seriously:
Transparent compression and(or) encryption (optionally) in reiser4 are
implemented via cryptcompress object plugin. Whats hot:
- Support of variable cluster size ((1, 2, 4, 8,..) * PAGE_SIZE)
via copy on clustering. The last means that page cluster will be
assembled into united flow before compression, and output stream of
decompression algorithm will be split into pages. Cluster size is an
attribute of cryptcompress files which means a size of maximal chunk
of data that can be passed to compression algorithm. This is required
attribute for each cryptcompress object, each cluster is compressed
and (or) encrypted independently. This allows to apply per cluster
various stream modes for encryption, which are also represented by
reiser4 stream plugins.
- High actual compression ratio which is close to ideal one that can
be provided by the compression algorithm for used cluster size. This is a
property of ctail items (aka fragments) that are used to store data of
cryptcompress objects.

Cryptcompress objects have special file attribute which is an ID of
reiser4 crypto plugin. If this attribute is zero, then file won't be
ciphered. Actually crypto plugin represents a crypto algorithm
supported by reiser4 and includes encrypt(), decrypt() and other
methods specific for this algorithm like setting a pointer of reiser4
specific inode data to cpu key, aligning flow before encryption,
etc.. The same for compression plugins.

Also cryptcompress file has the following extended attributes (I think
it will be useful to resolve some listed issues):
- digest plugin id (which represents digest algorithm supported by
reiser4: md5, sha1, etc..)
- key id (fingerprint of special randomly generated string, this string
is a part of a secret key, and this 'public' fingerprint is created
by appropriate digest plugin. 'Public' means that all EA should be
stored in disk stat-data. This key id allows to check authorization
every time when file is opened. Authorization is granted only by a
secret key (not by root password)

Reiser4 allows to support any compression algorithm of Ziv-Lempel
family, and any (symmetric or asymmetric) crypto algorithm (of course,
asymmetric ones are very slowly and may inflate data, but enabling of
short files encrypted by public/private keys can be useful for various
management purposes.
