I am using 2.0.36 on the server, 192.168.1.100 is the server, .101 is the
client (which runs Debian 2.1 as well, using 2.2.9 kernel). I am not using
knfsd.

Description: User space NFS server.
I have already filed a bug report with Debian. I attach the strace from the
server, while doing the mkdir and the find. Perhaps this will be more
helpful.
