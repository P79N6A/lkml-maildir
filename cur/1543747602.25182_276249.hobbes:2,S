Gee, OSDL has been doing this sort of testing for > 1 years now. Getting
bandwidth to look at the results has been a problem. We need more eyeballs
and community support badly, i'm very glad Marcelo has shown recent interest.

I would agree, and would do almost anything to help/assist/enable any humans 
interested. We need some expertise on when to run certain tests, to avoid
data overload. 
I've noticed that when developer's submit test results with a patch, it sometimes
helps in the decision on patch acceptance. Is there a way to promote this sort of
behaviour?
