	That is a possibility, though it's also more of a pain.  It also
doesn't work in the more general case of other pieces of the system which
can be taken offline and upgraded but perhaps not easily removed.

	You'd prefer large patches intended solely to filter a clean
interface better than letting root use a clean interface to do things
which *might* be bad?

	They aren't low-level diagnostics.  A firmware upgrade doesn't go
probing all around the bus looking for stuff like a diagnostic might.  Nor
does it probe the drive in funny ways, it uses a known (to the vendor, who
is writing the code) set of commands to pass a new firmware to the drive.

	There likely would be an option for either.  My method does not
deny the existance of your method.  Your method, however, is intended to
not allow mine.
