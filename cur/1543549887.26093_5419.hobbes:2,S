[sorry if your received this twice]
Hi out there!
We have just opened a new mailing list, dedicated to all Linux Crypto
topics. It is linux-crypto@nl.linux.org. Thanks go to all at
nl.linux.org for allowing me to host this mailing list using their
majordomo, esp. to Rik van Riel.
To subscribe, send an email to majordomo@nl.linux.org with the single
line
subscribe linux-crypto
in the _body_ of the message. You will receive a message telling you
what you need to do then.
This list is intended to be a forum for all sorts of crypto topics
concerning Linux. It will serve as a developers forum for the kerneli
international kernel patch (
http://www.kerneli.org
), too.
Since this list is new, it will be low-volume. If that volume grows, we
may split the list into -devel and -users, but as for now, everyone is
welcomed with open arms to join the list - be it newbie, be it
developer.
I also like to take this opportunity to point the ones of you interested
in this topic to the other Linux related Crypto mailing lists and
newsgroups (additions welcome):
