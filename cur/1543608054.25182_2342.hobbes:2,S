I'm using a K7S5A with recent 2.4.x kernels, and have no major
problems[0].
I don't remember why I have CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE on, but I do.
I also have CONFIG_IDEDMA_NEW_DRIVE_LISTINGS on, and obviously have
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513 on.
Oh, and I have CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB as well.
The only problems I have seen with this board are that I can't find
drivers for the sound (no big loss), lmsensors does not seem to be able
to properly read the sensors (annoying), repeated 'VFS: Disk change
detected on device ide1(22,0)' messages (my cdrom drive, getting a
little annoying), and, thats about it.
I have not seen any data corruption.
My obvious question is what kernels are you running, and are you
enabling CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513 or not?
