Hmmmmmm ... maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that (as
others never fail to point out whenever Linux-specific FAT behavior
comes up) the only raison d'être for FAT is compatibility with legacy
systems.  In this case you care about seeing the same timestamps as
these systems.
So, what do legacy systems do?
Extremely limited testing with NT4 vs. mtools suggests that the legacy
system I have seems to use the *current* DST setting -- or, more to the
point, reads and writes timestamps in reference to *current* wall clock
time, *not* correcting for whether DST was in effect at the file's
mtime.
So Linux FAT should do the same.  It breaks Unix semantics, but FAT
never was about Unix semantics in the first place.
