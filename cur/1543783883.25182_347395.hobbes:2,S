I'm not sure which module you're referring to, but the patch recommended by 
the speedtouch people links to linux-atm, and does not require kernel ATM or 
kernel pppoatm functionality, or use any kernel modules. I do notice it does 
a system ("/sbin/modprobe pppoatm"); but this is definitely not required; I'm 
speaking to you from a speedtouch DSL connection, no module loaded or 
compiled in, no ATM support in the kernel.

I stand corrected.
