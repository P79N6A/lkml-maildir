if you aren't comfortable with dropping a lot of the 2.2.18preX stuff onto
a production box, there is also the 2.2.18pre2aa2 kernel that andrea made
which has the VM stuff.  check out andrea/proposed/v2.2/2.2.18pre2 or
andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.18pre2aa2
unless you've made substantial updates to your patches, andrea?
