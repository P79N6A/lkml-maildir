My recollection is that you could set the version limit on a directory, and
this would propogate to all the files underneath, unless you explicitly
changed it.

I liked file versions when I was doing intense development, and it took a
lot of concentration to keep it all straight. It confused the heck out of
many people, and most sysadmins ran batch jobs to "purge" every night -- so
you could only count on versions being available for a limited time.
Is anyone working on version support for a Linux filesystem, as well as all
the utilities that would need to change?
