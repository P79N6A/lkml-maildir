I sent a mail out with a fairly detailed treatment of how RSS could be done.
Essentially, I feel that containers should simply limit the number of
pages used by the container, and not try and do anything magic with a
poorly defined concept like RSS. It would do this by creating a
"software zone" and taking pages from a "hardware zone" at creation
time. It has a similar affect to RSS limits except it's better defined.
In that setup, a virtualized environment would create it's own software
zone. It would hand that over to the guest OS and the guest OS could do
whatever it liked. It would be responsible for it's own reclaim and so on
and not have to worry about other containers (or virtualized environments
for that matter) or kswapd interfering with it.
