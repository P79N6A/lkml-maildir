This is terrific!!! How come something like this was not merged in earlier 
?!? This seems like an absolute neccesity!!! I'm willing to test it if that 
is what is needed to get it merged. What does Linus and others feel about 
this and most importantly when will see it in ? (Hopefully in this 
development cycle).
