Confused.  Disabling CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT should make those messages go
away.  lib/kernel_lock.c has:
#if defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT) && defined(__smp_processor_id) && \
		defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT)
/*
 * Debugging check.
 */
unsigned int smp_processor_id(void)
{
	...
	printk(KERN_ERR "BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [%08x] code: %s/%d\n", preempt_count(), current->comm, current->pid);
	print_symbol("caller is %s\n", (long)__builtin_return_address(0));
	dump_stack();
