I don't think the latency tracer is involved. I think this is the same
phenomenon as the regular latency spikes I reported earlier.
At some point I thought of a clock issue, indeed, so I switched to
pmtmr, but this is broken with voluntary preempt (I think it relates to
the sched_clock code when not using TSC -> precision of the reported
preempt threshold violations was 1ms). Worth mentioning is that the
latency spikes interval was the same even if I compiled cpufreq in and
switched the processor speed at runtime.

I can't turn PM off in the BIOS, but turning ACPI off in the kernel
suppresses the problem.

I don't think so (the spikes where still here when you first merged
wli's preempt timing patch and forced idle=poll).
So basically I think the spikes are BIOS related, they've been detected
so far by the alsa xrun_debug mechanism, by the latency-test suite, and
now by the latency tracer, which shows that they're not linked to any
particular code section.
