I reported a similar lockup with both 2.3.52-3 and 2.3.99-1.  Disabling
the SMB filesystem allowed the system to boot.  However, I was
subsequently unable to get a dhcp lease from cox@home using dhcpcd
1.3.17.  Rebooting into 2.3.47 allows a proper lease to be obtained.  Of
note is that ethernet card detection is reversed between 2.3.47 and
2.3.52/2.3.99.
dmesg from 2.3.99 reports:
