They are not claiming ownership of his code.  They are claiming ownership of THEIR
code.  V J is taking their code, adding on to it and selling the result.  Without
the GPL, V J cannot legally do this.  With the GPL, he can legally do this IF he
also gives out the complete source.  I fail to see how anything you are saying
absolves him of this requirement.
