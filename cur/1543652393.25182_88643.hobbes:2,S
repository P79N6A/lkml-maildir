In the InfiniBand case, the device's hardware address comes from a
combination of the port GID (which is set by the InfiniBand subnet
manager through an IB-specific mechanism) and the queue pair number
that the driver gets when it initializes.  There definitely still are 
problems to solve, such as specifying static ARP entries.

What would you consider a palatable ABI?  (I'm happy to implement it)
Enlarging sa_data in struct sockaddr doesn't seem feasible.  I guess
we could add a new socket ioctl() or extend SIOCGIFHWADDR/SIOCSIFHWADDR
somehow....
Thanks,
