Agreed.  I don't see any reason why ia64_alloc_vector() and
assign_irq_vector() couldn't or shouldn't be one and the same thing
(and assign_irq_vector() is a fine name).
Tom, if you want to send me a patch that converts the existing uses of
ia64_alloc_vector() to assign_irq_vector(), I'd be happy to apply
(assuming it's clean etc., as usual).
