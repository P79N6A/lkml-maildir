Hi,
I'm having trouble running the installation for Arch 0.7.1 on an Asus P5A
motherboard. The installation uses the 2.6.15 kernel and the problem is
that during, or immediately after, the initrd decompression stage the
machine reboots.
I've tried running an alternative installation kernel without SCSI support
as well as a number of kernel parameters (noacpi, noapm, acpi=off), none of
which helped.
The hardware is good, it is currently running another operating system
without issue and I gave the memory a thorough check with memtest86+ not
too long ago.
I have no idea where to even begin to find the source of this problem
but if anybody could offer some ideas or suggestions I would appreciate it.
Thanks.
Simon
