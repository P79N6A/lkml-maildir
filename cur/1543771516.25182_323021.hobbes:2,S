This is the only modification necessary to support eCryptfs. While we
are working on getting it ready for merging into the mainline kernel,
we would like to distribute it as a separate kernel module, and we
would like for users or distro's do not need to modify their kernels
to build and run it.
Would there be any objections to exporting the key_type_user symbol?
Is there any general reason why kernel modules should not have access
to the user key type struct?
