Again - why do you actually care?
If we end up removing the module, we'll call "unregister_blockdev()" or
whatever, which in turn gets rid of _all_ pages, and that that time we
will correctly get rid of buffers.
And before you remove the module I see no advantage to have any guarantees
of quiescence and removing the buffer heads. I only see extra code that
doesn't seem to have any real purpose..
