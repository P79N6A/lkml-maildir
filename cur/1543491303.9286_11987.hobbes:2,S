(I'm not sure fi this is the right list since it's the userland tools)
About ten files transferred correctly, but the one which is 4593 bytes long
didn't.
Look at this:
medusa:/Development/bridgett/cmvc$ cat
VirtualBuilder/BuildEnvironment/lib/perl/BPL_basic.pm 
cat: VirtualBuilder/BuildEnvironment/lib/perl/BPL_basic.pm: Connection timed
out
(medusa is AIX 4.3)
There is nothing in the Linux logs and I can't tcpdump it (token ring).
"mount" on medusa shows this (nfs not nfs3):
wyvern   /home/bridgett/cmvc /Development/bridgett/cmvc nfs    Mar 26 12:01
bg,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,shortdev,nodev,nosuid,rw
This is using the userland tools, not the kernel ones:
Package: nfs-server
Version: 2.2beta37-1
Cheers
Adrian
