     While the debate on whether or not to create a devfs ensues, I thought I'd
thrown in my own two cents.
     Something I positively hate about Linux now is the way it dynamically
assigns drives to device names when you boot.  So I have for example,
controller 0 with drives on ID 1, 3, and 5, and it maps them to /dev/sda,
/dev/sdb, and /dev/sdc, then I add a device on ID 2, and it changes the mapping
for the last two drives, or remove a device, etc.  This is really a PITA.
     Another concern I would have with devfs is the ability for permissions on
a device to persist across boots.  Chances are good that I don't want the
permissions on a device to be the defaults.  So then I have to add yet another
script to run at boot time to change all of the device permissions which slows
the boot process.
