This argument is bogus. We are talking about scripts here, which cannot
be merged, split, and modified. You don't cat(1) or sort(1) them - it's
just pointless to do that. You create them with text editors, and those
*can* handle the UTF-8 signature.

We can do that now, or in five or ten years. I'm willing to wait that
long, but I'm certain that more people will find the UTF-8 signature
useful over time. It's the only sane way to get non-ASCII into script
source in a consistent way.
