IMO you're going off on your own tangent.  Linus never singled out bsg 
(far from it, in fact, since bsg was not a major LOC contributor) or 
declared ABI-related fixes verboten.
I don't think anyone wants to release a userspace ABI with problems, 
since we all know that's basically locked in stone once its in a 
mainline release.
AFAICS his main complaint was he felt your push was a big honking huge 
change, late in the game, that included obvious non-fixes.  And it was. 
  lpfc was probably the biggest part of that, not bsg, and it's pretty 
clear such a big lpfc update should have gone in when the merge window 
was open.  The [non-lpfc] cleanups were also not -rc2 material.
