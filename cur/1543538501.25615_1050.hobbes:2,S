Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test3-pre6 cosmetic cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/9/4

This patch does all of the following:
(a) Makes some cosmetic fixes in Configure.help.
(b) Starts updating the README file for a 2.4 release (however, it still
    leaves the various development kernel warnings in, as we're only at
    2.4.0-test, not 2.4.0-pre). Also, "new bzip2 format" is changed to
    "newer bzip2 formats", as bzip2 isn't exactly new anymore (although
    it's still newer than gzip) and "format" is actually referring to both
    gzip and bzip2 in that sentence.
(c) Updates net/socket.c so that it prints "Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.4"
    at startup (as opposed to "for Linux 2.3").
(d) Does some cosmetic cleanup on REPORTING-BUGS: The paragraph indentation
    was inconsistent, and since one paragraph had no indentation and all the
    paragraphs were separated by blank lines anyway, I removed the
    indentations. Afterward, the first lines of some of the paragraphs had
    large gaps, so I cleaned up the word wrapping where necessary. Finally,
    I made a few minor punctuation changes.
(e) Updates the comment at the top of fs/ntfs/fs.c to say "NTFS driver for
    Linux 2.4.x" instead of 2.3.x.
If this is too much for a single patch or there are other objections, I can
split this patch up.
