And now ISTR that this is indeed the case, atleast going by
what we saw with "chat" microbenchmarks (fwiw :)).
Hold times weren't very high and most of the performance penalty
came from bouncing of the rwlock cacheline, which prompted us to
write a RCU-based patch for lockfree lookup from fd table.
