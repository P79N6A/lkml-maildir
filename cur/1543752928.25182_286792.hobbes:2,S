Indeed. It happens on any 64-bit architecture, I think.

There's no good way to shut up sparse, I think. The fact is, we _are_ 
losing bits, but it doesn't matter much in this case. I think 
"jiffies_to_msecs(MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET)" is fundamentally a suspect operation 
(since the ranges are different for the two types), and I think that the 
sparse warnign is correct, but it's one of those "doing the wrong thing is 
not always wrogn enough to matter".

Right. Same kind of situation.

I don't see it making a huge difference. Whatever you do will be wrong for 
some value of HZ anyway. If HZ is 10, and j > MAXULONG/10, then...
The issue is the same: jiffies and msecs have different ranges, so the
"fix" to some degree would be the same: making MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET small
enough. But as with the other case, it doesn't much seem to matter - it
turns out that the overflow cases end up being "very large integers"  
anyway, which is good enough, since that's what all those MAX_xxx things
are all about.
In the meantime, a warning might eventually make somebody decide to do
something intelligent that just makes it all go away (most likely
something like avoiding the conversion in the first place, and use
something like MAX_MSECS instead)
