Subject: [PATCH] Prevent reuse of active thread group id
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/8/20/67

The thread group id of a task is initially assigned the value of that 
task's pid, then is inherited for each child task created with 
CLONE_THREAD.  This patch makes sure that the thread group id is never 
re-used as another task's pid as long as there's an active task with that 
tgid.
Patch is below.
