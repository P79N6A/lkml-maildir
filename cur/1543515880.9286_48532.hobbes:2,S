please check out 2.3.27 - there is page_alloc() now. __get_pages() is now
officially gone and a page_alloc.c-internal function, the officially
exported APIs (and this is going to stay a stable interface) is
alloc_page() and alloc_pages(), which can allocate normal and highmem
pages as well. __get_free_pages() can only allocate normal pages. Note
that i noticed the ncpfs breakage and the fix is in 2.3.27. [that way it's
much cleaner and highmem-correct than doing __get_free_page() and a MAP_NR
hack] Sorry for the confusion.
