For a while, the guy who was working on the modutils overhaul (right after
2.2 came out) said that one of the next enhancements he was working on was
moving the autoclean reaper logic into userspace so that we could use
pre-removal scripts.  Did anything ever come of that?

You could fairly easily extend the kmod functionality to do that - in
fact, most of the changes would be user-space.  In the module, add in
request_module("sound-settings-save");
and then have modprobe take proper care of the sound-settings-save option
to run the settings saving program.
