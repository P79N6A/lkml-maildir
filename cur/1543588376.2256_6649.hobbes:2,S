Note: I'm not on this mailing list (for now, domain IP is changing).
Please email directly
1) I've noticed very high CPU load 3.00 running ./configure alone
2) some gnome applications (Gnome Mailcheck broke with 2.4.4-pre5)
3) Resolving local domains takes an awful long time (though netscape) but
not with 2.4.3.
Odd bugs... reverted for now.
Shawn.
