earlier in the thread.  I have seen the argument before that such a loss
isn't
accaptable because most machines only have a few runnable threads.  The
common
case may have thousands of threads, but only a handful ready to run, 
with the rest blocked on io. (io being network or disk, a networking
benchmark doing
local communication only isn't realistic, and many databases cannot be
held 
entirely in memory eiter.)
This is why I suggested the dynamic approach, the few who actually get
more than
a handful of threads ready-to-run *most of the time* may then get better
performance
without punishing the vast majorities who seldom see a load above 2.
