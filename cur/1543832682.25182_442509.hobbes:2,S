Ok, after observing this for a bit longer, it looks like this:
2.6.11.10 (Debian unloaded) - stable
2.6.16.9 (Debian with desktop applications) - grew from 3000 to 6000 then 
	fell back
2.6.17-rc5 (busybox ARM with applications) - grows so far, will watch for 
	a bit longer
2.6.17.4 (SuSE, practically idle) - stable
So, I'll keep it running until tomorrow then report again, unless someone 
can tell how it is supposed to behave and whether there has been a bug and 
it has been fixed?
Thanks
