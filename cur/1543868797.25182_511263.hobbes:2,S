Hi Marcus,
Could you give more details ? I'm stucked with a boot problem on a 
Asus P5W that also includes a Jmicron behind a Sata port on ICH8, and
the kernel boot goes timeout when probing it... I've been trying various
kernels,
including some patches from Tejun (Thanks !), but no luck to date...
Mind sharing your .config so that I can check if I missed something obvious ?
Regards,
Paul
