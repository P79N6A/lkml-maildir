I was quite happy till Ingo's first patch came out, and it was even better, 
but I over-wrote it, and we're still figuring out just exactly what the magic 
twanger was that made it all click for me.  OTOH, I don't think that patch 
passed muster with Mike G., either.  We have obviously different workloads, 
and critical points in them.

In the FWIW category, htop has always told me that x is running at -1, not 
zero.  Now, I have NDI where this is actually set at, so I'd have to ask 
stupid questions here if I did wanna play with it.  Which I really don't, the 
last time I tried to -5 x, kde got a whole lot LESS responsive.  But heck, 
2.6.2 was freshly minted then too and I've long since forgot how I went about 
that unless I used htop to change it, the most likely scenario that I can 
picture at this late date. 
As for speaking my mind, yes, and I've been slapped down a few times, as much 
because I do a lot of bitching and microscopic amounts of patch submission. 
The only patch I ever submitted was for something in the floppy driver, way 
back in the middle of 2.2 days, rejected because I didn't know how to use the 
tools correctly.  I didn't, so it was a shrug and my feelings weren't hurt.
Some see that as an unbalanced set of books and I'm aware of it.  OTOH, I 
think I do a pretty good job of playing the canary here, and that should be 
worth something if for no other reason than I can turn into a burr under 
somebodies saddle when things go all aglay.  But I figure if its happening to 
me, then if I don't fuss, and that gotcha gets into a distro kernel, there 
are gonna be a hell of a lot more folks than me trying to grab the 
microphone.
BTW, I'm glad you are feeling well enough to get into this again.
