Hi,
A few days ago I wrote about ide & raid0 bugs in 2.4.19-pre8-ac5 and below
(plain 2.4.18 just trashes fs in a few hours)... Then I was asked about my
hardware configuration & then was .... ignored silently. Does it mean that
nobody cares about ide support in Linux kernel?!
Could someone bring light on what's wrong with promise IDE & ultra ata-100
hdds??? (It was working under 2.4.7)
PS: right now I moved mailspool & oracle redo logs (located on raw devices)
out of ide-raid0... & I don't see error messages in logs not because ide
driver works, but because of significally reduced IO... OS w/o working ide
driver
is a real enjoyment.
