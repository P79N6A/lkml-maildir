Why does arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/Kconfig say:
config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
but arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/Kconfig say:
config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
# NOTE: no "select" on the latter one.  // Randy
Let's see.  Does that one-line patch fix anything?  <builds>
make oldconfig
< CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_TABLE=m
> CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_TABLE=y
Builds cleanly now.

Make x86_64 ACPI_CPU_FREQ select CPU_FREQ_TABLE like other methods do.
(although we should still eliminate as much use of 'select' as possible)
