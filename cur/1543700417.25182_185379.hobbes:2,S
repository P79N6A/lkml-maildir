Hi,
I have a problem when trying to build a kernel. It appears that make menuconfig
starts to loop - 
after writing "Preparing scripts: functions, parsing ...done."
This is 2.4.23, jfs114, gcc3.3.2.
What stuns me is - on this system I have *already* successfully built
2.4.23, and it is running just fine. This second build is for a different
target system, and the sourcetree is (obviously) in a different directory. 
1. /usr/src/linux  -> /usr/src/linux-2.4.23  - no problems.    /dev/hda1
2. /data1/linux  ->   /data1/linux-2.4.23 - loops.             /dev/hda4
Filesystem in both cases is JFS. 
Unpack a vanilla kernel into eg. /data1/kk23/linux-2.4.23 and trying it
there - same result. 
I haven't touched or replaced or done anything to ncurses, and lxdialog is
new/rebuilt.
I've straced the 'make menuconfig' and it is quite clearly looping. Can
anyone point me in the right direction and help me try to solve this??  
thanks,
