What that patch adds is to make it an ERROR if some irq goes to an 
unexpected cpu.
And that very much is wrong.

Umm. It got found the moment it became part of the standard tree.
The fact is, "months of testing" is not actually very much, if it's the 
-mm tree. That's at best a "good vetting", but it really doesn't prove 
anything.

So? Does that change the issue that this new model seems inherently racy?

No. You don't understand, or you refuse to face the issue.
The races are in _hardware_, outside the CPU. The fact that we do things 
in an irq handler doesn't seem to change a lot.
And what do you intend to do if it turns out that the reason it doesn't 
work on x366 is that the _hardware_ just is incompatible with your model?
I'm not saying that's the case, and maybe there's some stupid bug that has 
been overlooked, and maybe it can all work fine. But the new model _does_ 
seem to be at least _potentially_ fundamentally broken.
