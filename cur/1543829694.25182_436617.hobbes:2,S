I am seeing the same problem.  I had only noticed it
since I installed Opera-9.0 and thought it was Opera's
problem.  It even happened when I clicked to read this
message at www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.3/0091.html
to which I am replying.  I had to wait for the disk
access to end before the message link would display.
Something serious has happened to Linux 2.6.17.1  It
appears I installed both  2.6.17.1 and Opera-9.0 on
June 20 and that is when the disk timeout was first
noticed.  (I compile and use most every git/rc kernel
so if the problem is seen by people without Opera then
it must have entered the kernel very close to 2.6.17.1)
Next time I boot I will go back to 2.6.17
(Too bad I deleted earlier rc[567]-gits).
