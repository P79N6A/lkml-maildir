Subject: Locking md device and system for several seconds

Hi!
I'm using kernel 2.6.14.2 with md (RAID1 static) as bootable.
While md synching (initial creation or after marked one as failed,
removed and re-added) there are some locking problems with the
complete system/kernel.
Sometimes the system hangs (looks like a file/disk-access-lock)
while other tty's still work (until they access also to the disk).
This "hang" is some seconds (most from 10s up to 1 minute, seldom
more) and surprisedly the system continues working.
If md is in correct state (all partitions synced) this issue
doesn't seem to appear.
Configuration
4 Partitions (/boot 1GB, / 32GB, swap 16GB, /home 250GB) on
MaxLine III SATA 300GB Disks. Each of them (including swap)
is a RAID 1 device in the listed order.
This system has a Opteron 270 with nVidia Professional Chipset.
There are NO log entries found anywhere and no console warning/error.
These are 4 systems with she same behaviour.
Did anybody ever reported such an issue or has an idea?
