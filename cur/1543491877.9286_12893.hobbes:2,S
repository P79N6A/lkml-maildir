Guys,
I was configuring my new kernel 2.2.5
I am currently using 2.0.35
I see this option when I get towards the end.
CONFIG_NFSD_SUN:                                                                          
If you would like for the server to allow clients to 
access directories that are mount points on the local filesystem (this 
is how nfsd behaves on Sun systems), say yes 
here. If unsure, say N.
Shouldn't the default always be Yes? I just want ot be abel to use my 
nfsd in my new kernel the same old way I was using the 2.0.35 when I 
first installed it off the red hat 5.1 cd.
I don't know if this option was ever turned on in my old kernel. How can 
I tell?
Thanks guys!
