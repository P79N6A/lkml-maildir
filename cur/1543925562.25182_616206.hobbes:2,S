As I said before pata_acpi was not present in 2.6.23 -> Not a regression.
WONTFIX for 2.6.24. Not actually clear it is even a bug, the interactions
between using pata_acpi and simplex controllers are not documented
anywhere 8(

Tejun is looking into this - its not trivial so may be 2.6.25 material.
Similar reports for some other controllers (notably VIA).

Not sure who is handling this now - seems to be an IRQ routing bug
introduced in -rc2. I've got a pile of similar breakage reports for
random ATA controllers.
Thanks
