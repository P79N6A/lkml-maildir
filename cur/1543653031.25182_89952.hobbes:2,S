Subject: [BUG] 2.4.20-rc2 - Kernel Panic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I compiled latest 2.4.20 kernel for my router (Intel 486 DX 100Mhz) and
when booting up, it fired me with this message:
CPU: Intel 486 DX/4 stepping 00
Kernel panic: Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC feature!
In idle task - not syncing
... and there it stays, just flashing leds... (I also wonder why isn't num
lock flashing :P )
Ok.. here is part of my dot.config
# Processor type and features
#
# CONFIG_M386 is not set
CONFIG_M486=y
# CONFIG_M586 is not set
# CONFIG_M586TSC is not set
...
# CONFIG_MICROCODE is not set
# CONFIG_X86_MSR is not set
CONFIG_X86_CPUID=m 
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not set
# CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION is not set
# CONFIG_MTRR is not set
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
# CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set
# CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is not set
# CONFIG_X86_TSC_DISABLE is not set
CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
I guess it's a bug in a menuconfig...
And please Cc: me... i am not enlisted at linux-kernel. (I couldn't wait
for Mutt counting these endless seconds.)
