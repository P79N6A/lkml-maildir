Thank you for the review!  Comments interspersed below, though for
brevity the one-liners have been fixed.

Changed, since it seems reasonable that someone looking for PEx support
might not necessarily know that it is based upon IPMI.

I can (and did) update the code to use dev_get/set_drvdata for the
accessors.  However, the "iface" field exists as a mechanism to map
interface numbers to struct ibmpex_bmc_data/struct device data because
the callback that IPMI uses to notify clients that BMCs are going away
only passes the interface number, not the struct device itself.
Unfortunately, this means that get_bmc_data() must remain, but now it is
only used once at the end of life.

Doesn't look too hard; I'll have a go at it and see how it does.

Rough draft syndrome?  'tis fixed. :)
