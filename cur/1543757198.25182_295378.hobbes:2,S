Subject: kernel 2.4 inode/dentry cache not clearing on umount?

Also .. David :
Are you saying that, on a system with 256Megs of ram, of which the
kernel is reporting only 3-4Mb free because the inode/dentry caches
are taking up most of the memory, and NO page/swap file....
char *p;
p = (char *) malloc( 64*1024*1024 );
I assure you that under these conditions, the malloc( ) will fail with NULL.
---------------------------------
Now, in the meantime I have discovered that merely unmounting the
filesystem is not enough to clear the dcache and icache.
However, if I unmount the filesystem then run:
cat /dev/hda > /dev/null 
This causes the inode/dentry cache to finally shrink and the amount of
available free memory increases back to ~200Mb.   However, this
reduction does not immediately take place when the filesystem is
unmounted, and while the filesystem is mounted .. the inode/dentry
cache does not shrink and leaves only 3Mb of available free memory.
