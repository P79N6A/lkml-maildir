Hi,
Well, unlike Alexey I accept opinions even when a work has been done :-)

Alexey explained me why they should not and I agreed.
BTW, OpenBSD solution sucks.  After some analisys now I'm able to predict the
whole sequence taking 7 consecutive IDs.  You may send me an example and
I'll send you a sequence of the next IDs :-)
Now we have a strong RND based generator for the first ID for a peer.  But
its fairly slow (MD4 hash) and can't be used for every packet.  Strength of
the generator and requirements for a guaranteed long period contradicts each
other.
