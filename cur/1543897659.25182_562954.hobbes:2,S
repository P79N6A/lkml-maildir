No, because you're passing a _kernel_ pointer to sys_time_pps_fetch()
where it expects a userspace pointer. Use compat_alloc_user_space() to
find somewhere to put it in user space, instead. Or change your internal
__sys_time_pps_fetch() function to take a number of ticks instead of a
pointer to a timespec, then call that directly with appropriate
arguments, from both the normal and compat syscall routines.

No. The fact that you cannot test it is no excuse for submitting
something which is _known_ to be broken. Once you have it to the point
where a casual observer can't point out errors, then people can test it
for you.
