And that's why Ulrich Drepper likes to see a new syscall.  If we've
got a new syscall, we can easiliy store DT_UNKNOWN when using the old
one - and using the real value from the kernel with the new syscall.
For kernels without your changes, we need to set d_type to DT_UNKNOWN,
otherwise applications will break.
