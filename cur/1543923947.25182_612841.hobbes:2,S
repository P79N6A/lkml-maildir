How is this even an optimization?  It looks SLOWER to me.  The 
conditional read wastes memory bandwidth sometimes, if the condition is 
true, and v isn't already in the cache.  The unconditional write wastes 
memory bandwidth ALL the time, and dirties/flushes caches, in addition 
to not being thread safe.
This SHOULD be using a conditional write instead of a conditional read 
and an unconditional write.
