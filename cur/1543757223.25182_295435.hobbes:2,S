That's a problem (for my idea).

Thanks,  my implementation doesn't lock up with my unit testing (scp kernel 
tarballs).  However; I did have my scheduling pollocy for the net_tx net_rx 
and timer set to SCHED_RR using the same priority for each.  I'll fiddle with 
t relative prioites across the different soft IRQ's an see how much smoke I 
can cause.
