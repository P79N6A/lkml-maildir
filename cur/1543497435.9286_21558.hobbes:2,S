Under which filesystem? Aside of one optimization we might do and BSD does
for some filesystems (memorizing last lookup position for a while and
restarting lookup from that place) I'ld say that claim is pure BS.
->readdir() in *BSD doesn't populate per-fs directory caches, so he
might have a point with 2.0.x - there we used to do stupid things like
that (with dcache) and ls -l on large directory might cause massive dcache
sweep. Doesn't happen with 2.2/2.3.
Adding the test will not hurt, indeed. Doing it accurately might be
tricky, though. E.g. ls -l sorts the entries. In userspace. So you'll have
to factor that out - I doubt that GNU ls does bogosort, but...
