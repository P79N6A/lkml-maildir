Subject: DVB at76c651.c driver seems to be dead code

I didn't find any way how the drivers/media/dvb/frontends/at76c651.c 
driver would do anything inside kernel 2.6.11-rc3-mm2. All it does is to 
EXPORT_SYMBOL a function at76c651_attach that isn't used anywhere.
Is a patch to remove this driver OK or did I miss anything?
