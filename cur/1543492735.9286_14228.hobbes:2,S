Huh? I can understand your motivation -- you are trying to sell your
cards. What is the motivation for Linux when it gets slower because it
is trying to fix Sun's bugs? I think there are enough Linux machines
deployed to make an impact today. We dont need these silly fixes anymore.
Either Sun/Apple/MS fixes these bugs or the admin who talks to their
boxes (or owns their boxes) downloads the patches from somewhere else.
If the admin is really serious about getting the issue resolved then they
should contact the vendor -- maybe these vendors will react.
