In a Red Hat distribution, there is a /etc/modules...something file 
that should contain an alias (my only Red Hat distribution is home
so I don't remember the exact file-name). Basically, pppd looks to load
a compression module by this aliased name. Just add the alias to
load the module of your choice and the warning message will go away.
