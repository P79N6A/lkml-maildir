tar -g should do exactly this :-) Unftunatellyone thing considered as
changeable details is inode number (understandable) and it does not work
anymore since FAT does not have inode numbers or anything suitable to
generate them :-/ IMO better way is just small patch to tar ...
P.S. To Viro: is it possible to add ioctl to find out "first cluster" number ?
Then tar can use it instead of inode number for FAT. Even if "first cluster"
number is not inode number it IS suitable as replacement for this particular
case... Or such ioctl already there ?
