You're right, I hadn't realized that. I can now access all the sizes
from 640 to 1600, so I would say the fix is valid.

The snowy is constant and abundant, and it seems to be independent of
video size (640 through 1600) and screen occupation (single prompt
line to fullscreen mc session) and usage.

X's nv gives a very clean display, /unless/ I load nvidiafb before: if
I modprobe nvidiafb (it's a module, and it's blacklisted precisely for
this reason), then the screen is very snowy with X's nv too.
