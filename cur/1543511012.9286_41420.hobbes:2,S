hi gurus,
I make the following assumption (text in bold), if its wrong tell me the actual story.
"In ip.c ip gives the whole ip packet (with header) to the raw socket implementation. (RSI)
RSI strips the ip header off and gives the "raw ICMP" packet to the application which uses the socket.
Also the application when it wants to send a "raw ICMP" packet, it gives it to the RSI, which in turn 
gives it to ip.c which wraps it with IP header and sends it out."
is the story same for any other non-kernel related protocols.
thanx  in advance,
shankar
