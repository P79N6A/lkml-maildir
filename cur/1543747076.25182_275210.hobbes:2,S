The only problem with the 32-bit overflow is if you get scheduled
away in between releasing the CV's internal lock, i.e.
lll_mutex_unlock (cond->__data.__lock);
and
        if (get_user(curval, (int __user *)uaddr) != 0) {
in kernel and don't get scheduled again for enough time to reach
this place within 2^31 pthread_cond_{*wait,signal,broadcast} calls.
There are no things on the userland side that would block and
in kernel the only place you can block is down_read on mm's mmap_sem
(but if the writer lock is held that long, other pthread_cond_*
calls couldn't get in either) or the short term spinlocks on the hash
bucket.  SIGSTOP/SIGCONT affect the whole process, so unless you are
talking about process shared condvars, these signals aren't going to help
you in exploiting it.
But, once you get past that point, current NPTL doesn't care if 2^31 or
more other cv calls happen, it uses the 64-bit vars to determine what to
do and they are big enough that overflows on them are just assumed not to
happen.  And only past that point the thread is blocked in longer-term
waiting.

__data.__futex increases in pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} are so that
pthread_cond_*wait detects pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} that happened
in between releasing of internal cv lock in the *wait and being queued
on the futex's wait queue.  __data.__futex increases in pthread_cond_*wait
are so that FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE in pthread_cond_broadcast detects
pthread_cond_*wait that happened in between releasing the internal
lock in *broadcast and test in FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE.

Holding the internal lock over requeue kills performance of broadcast,
if you hold the internal lock over the requeue, all the threads you
wake up will block on the internal lock anyway.
