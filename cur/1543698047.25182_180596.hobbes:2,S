sfdisk has a slightly different option: -O will save all sectors that
you change during an sfdisk operation, so that you can restore them later.
You see, saving the logical partitions is not enough - these sectors
are spread out over the disk, and there used to be something else
where these sectors are written. If the user makes a partitioning mistake
he destroys a sector worth of data. It is that data that sfdisk -O will save
(and -I will restore).
