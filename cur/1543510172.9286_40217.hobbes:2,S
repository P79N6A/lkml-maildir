2.3.18ac7 breaks pci scan. Its a bug caused by some cleanup code that
I put in last moment. It should be fixed in 2.3.18ac8. 
If you use Don's driver be aware the resource management is broken for MMIO
mode unless it was changed very recently - thats not going to break it for
testing but will cause multiple detects if its non modular.
