The changelog I posted along with patch mentions all the changes I
made. I thought we will find all problems with this changelog in hand
and considering that its  just ~500 LOC.   But still, ok, asking
author himself will be good if he replies. I will mail him detailed
changelog and seek his feedback on this. This should answer all of
your questions.

Yes. We cannot come up with exhaustive set of test cases to cover all
cases. But assuming that _original_ version is right and taking the
chagelog we should be able to verify if the porting is correct.
