CONFIG_SCSI_SATA does two things:
* Enables/disables the display of the SATA driver menu.
* Enables/disables the compiled-in PCI quirk.
Both of these are boolean, and have absolutely nothing to do with modules.
The original problem that caused me to merge the problematic patch (my 
fault for bad merge) was that Kconfig wouldn't allow SATA drivers to be 
built as modules if you did
	bool SCSI_SATA depends on SCSI
	tristate SCSI_SATA_driver depends on SCSI_SATA
That's why I used an 'if' in my patch.  I suppose we could split it into 
two Kconfig options, one for the menu (CONFIG_SCSI_SATA) using 'if', and 
one specifically for the PCI quirk.  Such a split would make it obvious 
that CONFIG_SCSI_SATA controls display of a menu, and nothing more.
Comments?
The entire situation is a hack, because we're fighting the 
always-built-in IDE driver for control of the hardware.  IDE driver 
picks up the PATA+SATA device even though it isn't listed in 
drivers/ide/pci/piix.c PCI table, because it blindly probes at the IDE 
ports after exhausting other options.

Because it's fundamental a boolean, and has -zero- to do with modules. 
Encouraging people to think otherwise will just lead to more confusion.
