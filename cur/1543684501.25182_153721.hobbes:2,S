Funny indeed.
The USB standards define USB code 49 for the US \| key,
USB code 50 for the non-US \| key (French mu, etc),
and USB code 137 for the Japanese Yen |.
So, you should get one of these.
This USB code is translated to a Linux keycode in
usb_kbd_keycode[] in usbkbd.c.
The three possible translations are 43, 84, 183.
Maybe you can check for yourself (e.g. with a printk in usbkbd.c)
that you really get different USB codes from that keyboard under
2.4 and 2.6?
Maybe the code one gets depends on the initialization of the keyboard.
