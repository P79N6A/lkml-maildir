I was running X and a few applications when everything froze.
I tried Ctrl-Alt-Delete but that didn't do anything.
I also trued to use various Alt+SysRq keystrokes, but I was forced to
use Alt+SysRq+b
Here's the only stuff I thought would be relevant from the logs:
Oct 23 07:37:00 [kernel] atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set
2, code 0x6e, data 0xff, on isa0060/serio0).Oct 23 07:47:38 [kernel]
SysRq : Emergency Sync
Box specs:
AMD MP 2600
AMD 760MPX chipset
Radeon 7500
Adaptec Ultra160 SCSI adapter
I'm sorry I don't know what other information you guys might want.
Please tell me and I'll send it.
Thanks,
Harold
