The Tiger MP and MPX need (apart from i2c-dev) w83781d and i2c-amd756.
I'm using kernel 2.4.20 with the lm_sensors modules; the w83781d needs
a special patch (to recognize two subclients, iirc). The proper init
sequence is:
modprobe i2c-dev
modprobe w83781d init=0 force_subclients=0,0x2c,0x4a,0x4b \
	motherboard=tyan_s246x
modprobe i2c-amd756
Up till now I've had no luck with kernel 2.5.x, not that I've really tried.
Among other problems, I didn't get lm_sensors to compile. This may be fixed
by now, but I'm happy with 2.4.20 and haven't got too much time.
MfG, Ulrich
