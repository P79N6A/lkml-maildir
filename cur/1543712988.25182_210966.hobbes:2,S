Hi all,
I have been trying to fix a problem related to usb, with the help of the 
usb-dev list. Plugging in a usb device hangs my computer when bandwidth 
reclamation (fsbr) is turned on in the uhci-hcd driver.
I have found though, that when an interrupt is triggered by plugging in 
a usb device, the timer_interrupt() function in arch/i386/kernel/time.c 
is reached, and the computer hangs in mark_offset_tsc() in 
timers/timer_tsc.c. I removed the call to this function in 
timer_interrupt() and then usb worked as normal. I'm hoping there's a 
better way to get usb working than this though! This doesn't happen when 
fsbr is switched off.
The computer has a Crusoe TM5400 cpu and a VIA VT82C686A controller.
Thanks,
Malcolm.
