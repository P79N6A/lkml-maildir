Not all those from the British Isles. A first language an English as
school language is not that uncommon for segments of the population, and
in Wales schooling may also be such that English is learned as a first
foreign language.
That aside, please remember that Europe as a whole is a small place on the
bigger world stage. The total volume of potential developers in the huge
and rapidly modernising nations like India and China is vast, and there
are large highly skilled technical nations that don't teach English to
everyone technical by default.
Key documents in other languages is a big help, especially those about
values, culture and standards because they are things that are not easy
to understand if your use of English is technically oriented.
