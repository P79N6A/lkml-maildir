Or maybe there are bugs in both of these front-ends.  I finally thought of
looking at two .config files in text editors, one produced by make xconfig
and one produced by make gconfig.  Both are for kernel 2.6.0-test7 though
the machines and original distros are different.
In the .config generated by make xconfig, the following lines exist:
#
# USB Human Interface Devices (HID)
#
CONFIG_USB_HID=m
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
# CONFIG_HID_FF is not set
# CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV is not set
#
# USB HID Boot Protocol drivers
#
# CONFIG_USB_KBD is not set
# CONFIG_USB_MOUSE is not set
# CONFIG_USB_AIPTEK is not set
# CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
[...]
OK, aside from making me wonder what HIDDEV refers to and why it isn't set,
and making it rather non-obvious which drivers are HID Boot Protocol and
which aren't, the settings look pretty reasonable to me.
In the .config generated by make gconfig, the following lines exist:
#
# USB Human Interface Devices (HID)
#
CONFIG_USB_HID=y
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
# CONFIG_HID_FF is not set
CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV=y
# CONFIG_USB_AIPTEK is not set
# CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
[...]
With this file in a text editor, searching for string USB_KBD results in the
string not being found.
