The sourceforge site is the most up to date place for PCMCIA.  That is
the best place to report bugs that are specific to that code.  For
bugs that are specific to things in the 2.4 tree and/or have to do
with how PCMCIA interacts with other subsystems (i.e., the problem
that started this thread, where I think the problem is in the PCI
subsystem), then linux-kernel is probably a better place.
