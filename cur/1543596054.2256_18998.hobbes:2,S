Subject: 2.4.5 Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!

Hello,
I have compiled 2.4.5 four times now, and it just won't boot. I have
compiled and used every previous 2.4 kernel without problems, using the
same configuration. The compiler is gcc 2.95.2, but I also tried gcc 3.0
without success. The system crashes early in the boot process, so I
haven't been able to capture the whole error message. One of the first
things I see scroll by is "Machine Check Exception", then the last three
lines are:
>Code: [20 bytes, variable. Sometimes 20 times "%2x"]
>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
>In interrupt handler - not syncing
Now this is an old Compaq LTE 5200 laptop, Pentium 120MHz, 72MB RAM.
cat /proc/pci yields:

As I said, I had no problems with 2.4.n, n<5. I tried a 2.4.6pre kernel
(5, I think), and that *didn't work* either. I would greatly appreciate if
anyone had any suggestions regarding this. And if they could cc: it to me,
that would be great. Thanks!
