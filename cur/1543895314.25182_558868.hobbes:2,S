Having a git commit Id, like d09c6b809432668371b5de9102f4f9aa6a7c79cc,
how can I create a .diff file from that?

I think git bisect made an error... as you can see for yourself
with the list of tested git Id's that I gave - it didn't test
both sides of that patch imho. If you tell me how to extract a patch
then I'll manually unapply it to some failing kernel revisions and
see if that makes a difference.
