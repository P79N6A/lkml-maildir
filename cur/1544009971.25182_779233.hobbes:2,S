You mean there are drivers, that have struct dma_async_tx_descriptor on 
stack? Can you give me an example? And you mean, that increasing the size 
of the struct by one pointer and letting users explicitly free those 
descriptors when they want is worse than introducing a tasklet that will 
have to periodically scan the list of descriptors while other hot paths 
will move elements to and from this list, look for acked elements, lock 
the list and free those elements? Periodically, because although we have 
an event when to free them - on ioctl - there is no API to trigger that 
tasklet. Or am I missing something? I can do this, it just sounds strange 
to me.
Thanks
Guennadi
