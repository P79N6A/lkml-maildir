   The place where this is a real problem is in drivers where data is
   shared between the adapter and the host CPU, for instance the
   53c7xx driver. On the m68k we currently use a
   kernel_set_cachemode() function to change the caching of the page
   allocated for the shared structures, but thats a pretty non
   portable way of doing it. I would like to see something a
   get_free_cachecoherent_page() interface instead, what do you think
   of that?
Sounds like pci_alloc_consistent()
Go read the document and check out the interfaces, I believe
you'll be pleasantly surprised :-)
