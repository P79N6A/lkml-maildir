Hi!
I'll probably regret getting into this discussion, but:

Why? You run out of atomic memory, start dropping the packets before
they even enter the kernel memory, and process backlog in the
meantime. Other hosts realize you are dropping packets and slow down,
or, if they are malicious, you just end up consistently dropping 70%
of packets. But that's okay.

"Lets throw some memory there and hope it does some good?" Eek? What
about auditing/fixing the networking stack, instead?

And what problem are you trying to fix, anyway? Last time I asked I
got reply around some strange clustering solution that absolutely has
to survive two minutes. And no, your patches do not even solve that,
because sizing the pool is impossible.
