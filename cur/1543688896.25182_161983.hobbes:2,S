It's the right test.  "too slow" means that where shared memory is
mapped at a certain separation, alternating accesses between the
different virtual addresses are much slower (10-20 times) than if the
underlying mapped memory is not shared.
All Athlons show this slowdown for any virtual address separation
which is not a multiple of 32k.  No Intels do, with the possible
exception of a P4 which showed inconsistent results and needs further
investigation.
Your freebsds don't what CPU they are, but let me guess..
     freebsd isn't an AMD
     freebsd3 and freebsd4 are both AMD K6, and freebsd3 is the faster
