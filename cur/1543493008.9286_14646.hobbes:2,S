Take a look at the book "in search of clusters" it goes into a lot of
detail on everything that is needed to run parallel systems, both SMP and
cluster setups. It boils down to the fact that you can get better
performance from the existing types of chips then you could get from
creating an on-chip SMP.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
