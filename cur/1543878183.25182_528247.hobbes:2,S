OTOH, the other half of the fields has nothing to do with them (signals). 
Not only, the more time it passes, the more ppl (reason why I posted this 
comment in the beginning) sees the "struct signal_struct" has a boilerplate
where to store shared resources.
Chosing a name like "struct task_shared_ctx" fits it, because "signals" 
are *a* task_shared thing, whereas all the fields on the bottom of the 
"struct signal_struct" (on top of the ones that ppl will want to add 
everytime there's somethign to be shared between task structs) are *not* a 
"signal".
