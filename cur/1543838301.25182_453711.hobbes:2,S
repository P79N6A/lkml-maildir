Not sure. I'm somewhat puzzled.
Disassembling the Code: of your oops shows that we were trying to dereference esi,
which was -1 for some bizarre reason.  (my objdump really hated disassembling that
function, but I think thats my tools rather than breakage in the oops).
Question is how did that list member get to be -1 ?
One pie-in-the-sky possibility is that we've corrupted memory recently, and
this link-list manipulation just stumbled across it.  Note that the last file
opened before we blew up was reading i2c.  Can you try and reproduce this
(if you can reproduce it at all) without the sensors stuff loaded ?
It's a long-shot, but without further clues, I'm stabbing in the dark.
