Peter, I tried on a similar box and couldn't reproduce this problem
with x86_64 2.6.22-rc3 kernel and using defconfig(has SCHED_SMT turned on).
I am using top and just the spinners.  I don't have gkrellm running, is that
required to reproduce the issue?
I tried number of times and also in runlevels 3,5(with top running
in a xterm incase of runlevel 5).
In runlevel 5, occasionally for one refresh screen of top, I see three
spinners on one cpu and one spinner on other(with X or someother app
also on the cpu with one spinner). But it balances nicely for the
immd next refresh of the top screen.
I tried with various refresh rates of top too.. Do you see the issue
at runlevel 3 too?
thanks,
suresh
