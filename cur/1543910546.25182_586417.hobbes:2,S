Hmm.  Check the V=1 make output to see that the lparmap.c really got the -g0.
The log says it didn't.  Oops!  It looks like the patch that got committed is
the one that sets CFLAGS_lparmap.s, but really it needs to set
CFLAGS_lparmap.o instead (go kbuild).  Did I post the wrong one?  (It's only
one letter different.)  Sorry about that!  (I committed the right one to
Fedora, which you'd think would help Dave, but no.)
Thanks,
Roland
