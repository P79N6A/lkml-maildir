FreeBSD doesn't have Reyk's ath(4) HAL, which OpenHAL is based on.
FreeBSD has a driver written by Sam, and a binary-only HAL, also written by Sam.

How? FreeBSD doesn't have Reyk's ath(4) HAL from OpenBSD, so there are
no possible licensing accusations and violations.

FreeBSD's ath(4) code, both the driver and the HAL, is entirely
written by Sam Leffler, who can licence it in whichever way he seems
reasonable. The driver part of Sam's code is also present in OpenBSD,
but the HALs in OpenBSD and FreeBSD are entirely different.
