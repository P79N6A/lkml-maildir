best would be to have a reproducer. Can you trigger it over the network,
using a remote session? If yes then you might want to try this: let the
box boot in, switch it to a text console and dont touch the keyboard
after that. Do this over the remote session:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/debug_direct_keyboard
this activates a direct interrupt line for the keyboard only. Keep the
box on the text-console, and try to reproduce the hang over the network. 
Once it triggers, try SysRq - does it work? (leds wont work, but normal
keys should work.)
if the keyboard still doesnt work then you could try nmi_watchdog=1 or
nmi_watchdog=2 (the latter on IO-APIC-less systems), and serial logging,
to capture a dump of the hard-lockup.
