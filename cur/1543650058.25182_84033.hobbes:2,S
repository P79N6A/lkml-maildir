O.k.  For the cpu shutdown case I am not certain if this can be modeled
properly but here is a shot at thinking it through.
Drawing the APIC dependencies I get a tree is in parallel and usually
flatter than the normal device tree.

 Legacy PIC     PCI device 1  PCI device 2
The only sane way I can think to do is to put the apic tree, above
the pci bus trees.  This should preserve the requirement not to
shutdown IOAPICs, before shutting down the pci devices, that send
interrupts through them.  The hard challenge is that IOAPICs
can appear as pci devices, so it is at least possible for devices
on one pci bus to depend on the IOAPIC on anther pci bus.  
However, if we do not disable the PCI bridges/busses it should not be
an issue.  We just need to keep from disabling the IOAPICs, and other
PICs until after we have shutdown all of the other devices.
To properly shutdown an SMP system so it can be reinitialized the PICs
must be placed in legacy mode.  Which means all of the IOAPICs must
come down.
Does this sound like something that is reasonable to tackle?
Getting it right is a challenge but I do have a good test case :)
