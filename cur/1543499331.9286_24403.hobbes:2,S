Hi,
I just had my first hang for months. Quite strange... samba still worked,
but no other service. You can not log in on the console. You can still
switch between them. The machine responds to ping, and telnet gives a
connection (but no login prompt). Nothing special in the logs.
Magic Sysrq reboot still worked.
The machine is a P2-450, 128 MB, aic7890 SCSI, 3com905 ethernet.
