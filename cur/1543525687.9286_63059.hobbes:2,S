FWIW NetGear do a box which is not a million miles away from this sort
of thing. Basically it's a 20G drive in a 8"x5"x2" box which sits on
the end of a 100Base T and speaks (IIRC) SMB and HTTP for
config. Can't remember the price and it's not _exactly_ what you
talking about but it's on the market today so I'd guess that NetGear
at least would buy your arguments.
