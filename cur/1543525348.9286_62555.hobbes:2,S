Figured I peep in here. I'm running a system that makes heavy use of caps.
Every daemon is in a chroot jail, every processes that needs more then
normal user access, uses capabilities. I've even globally droped some caps
(the rawio/blockdevice cap provided by a patch).
I'm very familar with 'the' unix kernel, and lowlevel programming. But
even with that knoweldge it was often difficult getting the caps right.
Complexity = security holes.
If we go to many more caps, it will be virtually impossible for anyone but
gurus to safely use them, and since it's a platform specific thing, I
don't know how many applications will use them out of the box.
It might be useful for someone to instrument strace so that it could tell
you what caps a bin is using.
