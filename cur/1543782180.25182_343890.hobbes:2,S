MGA requires the ROM can be mapped temporarily in order to read the data
tables. X itself solves this by mapping the ROM over the RAM addresses
assigned by the OS then mapping the RAM back after finishing with the
ROM. Its a fairly standard video card trick.
What X does in the presence of kernel support it recognizes I'm not
however sure.
