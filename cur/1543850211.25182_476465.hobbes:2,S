Hello folks,
I would like to ask you clarify me one question in the the following patch:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@449b144ecSF1rYskg3q-SeR2vf88zg
# ChangeSet
#   2006/06/22 15:05:57-07:00 neilb@suse.de
#   [PATCH] Fix dcache race during umount
#   If prune_dcache finds a dentry that it cannot free, it leaves it where it
#   is (at the tail of the list) and exits, on the assumption that some other
#   thread will be removing that dentry soon.
However as far as I see this comment is not correct: when we cannot take
s_umount rw_semaphore (for example because it was taken in do_remount) this
dentry is already extracted from dentry_unused list and we do not add it into
the list again. Therefore dentry will not be found by prune_dcache() and
shrink_dcache_sb() and will leave in memory very long time until the partition
will be unmounted.
Am I probably err?
The patch adds this dentry into tail of the dentry_unused list.
