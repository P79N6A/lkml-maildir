Subject: [PATCH] -mm: Small schedule() optimization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello all,
I found that there's a possible small optimization right at the very
beginning of schedule():
        if (likely(!current->exit_state)) {
                if (unlikely(in_atomic())) {
can be reversed into
        if (unlikely(in_atomic())) {
                if (likely(!current->exit_state)) {
This is a Good Thing since it avoids having to evaluate both checks,
and both use current_thread_info() which has an inherent AGI stall risk on
x86 CPUs if it cannot be inter-mingled with other unrelated opcodes.
I'm a bit puzzled that this has not been done like that before.
Probably since the exit_state check got added as an after-thought...
Or did I miss some important reason here? (branch prediction??)
Patch against 2.6.16-rc5-mm3.
Thanks!
