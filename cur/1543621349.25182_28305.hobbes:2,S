This begs the question from the powers that be, what is the opinion of 
using sh vis bash?  'printf' is available as a bash builtin and as a 
sh-util file which should be found on most distributions; enough for me 
to say that lacking both bash and the sh-util printf should be a rare 
occurance.

Thanks.  This version of loadkeys comes from the kbd package (btw, 1.06 
was released a while ago).  The place where I'm using loadkeys is in the 
console-tools package, if you can find a tool that exists more commonly 
in console tools, great.  However I'm wondering if I really need to make 
the distinction in the script.  Is it really important to show the 
version of both kbd and console-tools? I'm beginning to think that 
avoiding this ugly mess would be nice, just print out a given version 
number from a series of a|b|c|d trials and whatever comes out first 
should be suitable.

I kind of figured that :)

In this situation, it'll be a matter of keeping up with the Joneses. 
 There is an incredible amount of stubborness to changing already 
existing files in /proc so I'm not going to give this any thought.

Not that I'm an old fart, but I discovered Linux back in the pre 1.0 
days. Linux was my roommate's get rich quick ISP idea when 56K dedicated 
lines were the bomb.

Heh.. I could make work arounds, but that adds complexity which tends to 
add breakage.   Perhaps someone can suggest an ingenious method for 
figuring out what is/isn't supported by the kernel
