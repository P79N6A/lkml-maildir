The most reliable RAID-5 you can build is a 3-drive system.  For each  
byte of data, you have a half-byte of parity, meaning that half the  
data-space (not including the parity) can fail without data loss.   
I'm ignoring the issue of rotating parity drive for simplicity, but  
that only affects performance, not the algorithm.  If you want any  
kind of _real_ reliability and speed, you should buy a couple good  
hardware RAID-5 units and mirror them in software.
