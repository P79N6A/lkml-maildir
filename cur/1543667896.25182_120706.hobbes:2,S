Well, first off this is probably a virtual address, not a physical
one. I don't know why you're trying to do this, but there are bits in
arch/i386/boot/ that will likely need fixing up for you to do this.
If that's really the physical address you're trying to use you're
going to need a special bootloader and some invasive arch/i386/ changes.
