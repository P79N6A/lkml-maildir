I think I got it !!!
After fixing my mem eater program (per Adam and Zwane's
suggestions), I get the attached "end-less" panic ...
This happens immediately when I start the a.out ...
So does this make any sense to you guys ? What is wrong with
my kernel/system ?
Thanks a lot guys !!!
Kind Regards,
rudi
