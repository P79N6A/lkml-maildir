(Joules) I bet that came from the hardware. And given that laptop 
batteries run at (almost) constant voltage, could all of these just be

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
