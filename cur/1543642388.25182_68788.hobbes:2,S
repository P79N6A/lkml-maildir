I wasn't involved in this benchmark, I just reformatted the results.
However, it might be that this benchmark is a tad braindead and 'suffers'
from far better timing resolution because of HZ=1000. I'm unsure. I saw that
this benchmark used something like a Sparcstation 5 as a reference platform,
so maybe it is not geared for today's processors.
