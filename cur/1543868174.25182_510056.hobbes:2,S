That's pretty much it, yes.  When you're talking to a serial port, you 
have a stack that looks roughly like:
	(Userspace)
	VFS layer
	tty layer ----------------------\
	serial core layer                line discipline
	serial driver
	(Hardware)
There are other devices which can exist below the tty layer, like the 
pty driver:
	(Userspace)
	VFS layer
	tty layer ----------------------\
	pty driver                       line discipline
	-hpa
