I'll see what those I have to answer to think. I'll have to warn you,
the NUMA-Q code in 2.4.x hasn't been very heavily focused on recently
so it may depend on someone testing/debugging the 2.4.x-based tree on
another machine (we haven't quite lost all the NUMA-Q's in our lab to
this) before the RAM goes away. I myself don't have guarantees I'll have
sufficient time for "must do" things -- if I run out of time it's gone
regardless. Extras are definitely a question of chance.

They should be able to utilize the same technique for cutting down
mem_map, and there are pending bits around that allow the pte_chain
allocations to be eliminated entirely for file-backed memory, and so
embedded systems's needs can be accommodated with a bit of extra
adjustment for !CONFIG_SWAP and they'll never see pte_chains again.
