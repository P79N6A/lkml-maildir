The reason Linus said he didn't allow George's kgdb mm patch to 
be integrating into the kernel a year or two ago was that Amit and
George had significantly different implementations. So Amit, Tom, 
George, and the rest of the kgdb development gang worked together 
and came up with a unified version that we now support on SourceForge. 
Tom rolled up a mm patch back in December for Andrew and then the
integration process stopped. I suggest we work together on getting
the kgdb patch back into the mm series and permanently into the kernel
like the kexec code and then we can avoid this kernel development
obfuscation.
