Hi,
I've missed most of this thread, but have cause to be interested.  Do
you have a generic recipe for reproducing file corruption?  I seem to be
(read pretty darn sure, modulus hw (wish) vs sw testing methods...)
experiencing memory corruption problems with 2.6.19, and am interested
in anything that might be related (trigger!).
