This has nothing to do with your patch at all, but why is 'page -
mem_map' being open-coded here?
I see at least a couple of page_to_phys() definitions on some
architectures.  This operation is done enough times that s390 could
probably use the same treatment.
It could at least use a page_to_pfn() instead of the 'page - mem_map'
operation, right?
