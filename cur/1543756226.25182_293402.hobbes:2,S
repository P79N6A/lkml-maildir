I have done a bit more digging.
For some reason, likely historical we don't initialize the
IO_APIC in init_IRQ().  Instead we wait until smp_prepare_cpus() or
smp_init().  Both functions are called much later in the init process
than calibrate_delay().
Given the separation that has happened between apics and SMP it should
be possible to initialize the local apic and the IO_APIC of the boot
cpu much earlier in the game.  It looks like it may take some heavy
lifting though.
