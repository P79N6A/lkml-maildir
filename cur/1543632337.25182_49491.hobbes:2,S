it is not very important, but of course it could go in too.

well, as Andrew said it's a microoptimization, but it's not buggy. It is
used to avoid marking a page referenced twice if somebody reads with an
userspace buffer granularity smaller than PAGE_SIZE, the same
optimization exists in the read side (there it is a bit more of a
microoptimization because the writer never activates pages but the
readers activates pages without such check).
