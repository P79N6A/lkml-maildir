Not really.  They will end up synchronized through a mechanism called
the cache capture effect: the image that is behind will have the benefit
of having the precursors already having read the input, so it's ready
for use in the cache already, therefore it will run faster.  The stable
condition, as long as the writers are close to the same speed and the
writes are started at close enough to the the same time, is that they
are all writing the same data at almost the same time.
