OK - I separated the i386 and x86_64 bits to make it easy to drop the
x86_64 part.
Plus, I think it doesn't make any difference - the headers behave the
same as seen from the outside, except that UML needs the uml-cmpxchg
patch in order to build.  So, putting that first, then the other two
separately results in a patchset that builds at all stages, I believe.
