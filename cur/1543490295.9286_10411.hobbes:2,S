I have some low level questions about the MM code, and specifically how
it works on the i386 platform.
Since the questions are probably "off-topic", could someone who has good 
knowledge of the mm code, plus understands most of arch/i386 send me
a private mail (if you are willing to answer my questions)?  This way,
we keep questions off the list (esp since they may be stupid time wasting
questions).
