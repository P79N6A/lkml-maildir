Subject: Athlon Bug Stomper Success Reports for 2.4.14

My Athlon Thunderbird has been happily compiling kernels for over 24 hours
straight using 2.4.14 with an Athlon-optimized kernel.  It could not do this
in many past kernels and I believe the code snippet offered in September is
working nicely.  There was a long thread about this back then, but I haven't
seen any Athlon problem reports between that time and now.  For the lurkers on
the list, and the benefit of archives, could we please record a few successes?
If you are using an Athlon with 2.4.14 and you previously had problems but now
have stability with an Athlon optimized, kernel, please respond.  (Just a few
people, please.)
Oh, hardware is Tyan Trinity KT-A (S2390B) with Athlon Thunderbird 1.2Ghz,
512M Crucial PC133 Cas2 RAM, many drives..etc.
My sincere appreciation and thanks to all that were involved in tracking this
down and making the fix possible.
