 From later posts I suspect that your disk performance just sucks, but 
do  use one of the monitoring tools and follow the actual disk work, in 
term of seeks and transfer rate.
I've been looking at high iowait while disk and network are (nearly) 
idle, but it sounds as if you just have a bad match of CPU and disk speed.
Can you borrow a USB drive to use for some testing? USB 2 needed to be 
faster than your old 4200 rpm drive.
