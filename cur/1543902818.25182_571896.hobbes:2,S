and the WARN_ON() below does not seem to trigger.
i'll now check whether removing ignore_on_loglevel (no other changes) 
makes the hang go away. Maybe ignore_on_loglevel is buggy - or it 
produces an immediate printk (going out to the interface) during a 
particularly sensitive period of network initialization.
