You must be joking. Page replacement should be tuned to
do good page replacement, not just to be easy on the CPU.
(though a heavily thrashing system /is/ easy on the cpu,
I'll have to admit that)

Simple, yes. But completely BOGUS if you don't age the cache
and the mapped pages at the same rate!
If I age your pages twice as much as my pages, is it still
only fair that your pages will be swapped out first? ;)

And the same should be done for other pages as well.
If you don't do that, you'll have big problems keeping
page replacement balanced and making the system work well
under various loads.
