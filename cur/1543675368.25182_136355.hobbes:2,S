I've finally gotten 2.5.70-mm1 compiled and bootable on my system, but
with my /home being RAID1, I was getting crashes that looked alot like
this as well.  This was a Dual PIII Xeon 550, with a mix of IDE and
SCSI drives.  /home was on a pair of 18gb SCSI disks, RAID1.  
I also had problems with the new AIC7xxx driver and had to drop back
to the old one to get a boot.  I think.  Lots and lots of confusion
here.
