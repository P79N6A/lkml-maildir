Hi,
   First of all I am not subscribed to the list... Then, I
would like to ask why on earth are the process shared attribute
on mutexes & conditional variables still not available on
Linux? it is sad indeed :( Of course, if somebody has an
example of how to emulate such a thing it would make 
life easier....
