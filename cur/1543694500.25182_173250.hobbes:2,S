I try to compile linux-2.6.0-test7 from ftp.kernel.org on SMP machine
and I god something like this:
[...]
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  LD      kernel/built-in.o
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms1.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms1.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux2
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  LD      vmlinux
  AS      arch/i386/boot/setup.o
  LD      arch/i386/boot/setup
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
  GZIP    arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin.gz
  LD      arch/i386/boot/compressed/piggy.o
  LD      arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/vmlinux.bin
  BUILD   arch/i386/boot/bzImage
Root device is (8, 1)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 4943 bytes.
System is 1298 kB
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready
  Building modules, stage 2.

*** Warning: "percpu_counter_mod" [fs/ext3/ext3.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "percpu_counter_mod" [fs/ext2/ext2.ko] undefined!
and ext2 dosn't work.
Fast workaround is make file kernel/ksyms.c and add to this file two lines
#include <linux/percpu_counter.h>
EXPORT_SYMBOL(percpu_counter_mod);
and fix kernel/Makefile.
Please don't tell me that this is wrong, I try to understand WHY 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(percpu_counter_mod) from lib/percpu_counter.c didn't work
but I faild.
This work for me.
Thanx 
					Sas.
