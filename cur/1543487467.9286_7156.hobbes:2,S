If I understand you, you wish to have multiple sessions active (one per
family member for the example), all accessable from the console.  And
that one member not be able to access another member's session without
a password.
I infer that this is because you wish to not lose the state you've
built up in the course of using the session (command history, etc etc).
And also the multiple tasks you may have open - editors, whatever.
I think the nearest solution to your probelm at present is the "screen"
program.
This
	- lets you have multiple sessions on the one console
	- lets you detach without killing the sessions
You should be able to find an rpm for "screen" at:

Between them, this may do what you want. You arrange that everyone runs
screen (by hacking /etc/profile, most likely). When a person leaves the
console they detach their screen session and log out like normal.  When
next the sit down they log in as normal and reattach to their detached
screen session.
This may do it for you.
