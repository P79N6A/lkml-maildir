... which they derive from distro kernels or some old .config they always 
used, via 'make oldconfig'. You are arguing against well-established facts 
here.
If you dont believe my word for it, here's an analysis of all kernel 
configs posted to lkml in the past 8 months:
   $ grep ^CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG linux-kernel | wc -l
   424
   $ grep 'CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG is not' linux-kernel | wc -l
   109
i.e. CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y is set in 80% of the configs. A large majority 
of testers has it enabled and /sys/debug/sched_features was always a good 
mechanism that we used for runtime toggles.

x86 defconfig is used too, but it's a pretty rare usage.
Under default i mean the customary meaning of default config: it's the 
default if you come via 'make oldconfig' or if you derive your config from 
a distro config:
| config SCHED_DEBUG
|        bool "Collect scheduler debugging info"
|        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && PROC_FS
|        default y
