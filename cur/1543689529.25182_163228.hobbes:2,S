I have an HP Pavilion ze4145 notebook and it has a National Semiconductor
DP83815 chip in it. The NIC works fine in other OS's but under Linux (Debian
3.0) with any kernel version, I get "init_module: No such device", and the
usual errors about insmod failing.
The only thing out of the ordinary in lspci is "Subsystem: Unknown device
3c08:2400".
What's wrong?
