Thank you! Yes! All in favor say Aye..AYE!!! Motion passes,
the infiniband people don't get to call it TOE anymore..

Ditto, but I see it being used to rollout the idea and process,
rather than anything of value now, and the lessons are being
learned for the future, when we reach 20Gb, 40Gb, even faster
networks of tommorow. The processors might keep up, but nothing
else will, for sure.

as will bug fixes, and debugging becomes a right royal pain.
Also, most profiles of networking applications show the
largest blip is essentially the user<->kernel transfer, and
that would still remain the unaddressed bottleneck.

The thing is, all the TOE efforts are propietary ones, to
my limited knowledge. Thus all the design is occurring in
confidential, vendor internal forums. How will they/we
come up with really the needed, _common_ design approach?
Or is this not so needed?
