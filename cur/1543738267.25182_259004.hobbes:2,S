 that is the base that i am working from (fuse).
 the problem comes when adding support to fuse for xattrs, and the
 subsequent use of those xattrs for SE/Linux.
 security/selinux/hooks.c cannot cope with the -512 response
 "please try later" which the fuse module always always always
 sends, in order for fuse to give the userspace daemon a chance
 to wake up and smell the roses.
 ... and i sure ain't gonna hack selinux about!

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from
the same well: Love.  If you love yourself and everyone and everything
around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
