When I asked at Brainshare 2001 when support for files over 4GB files 
will be added to NCP, they told me that I should switch to CIFS or 
NFS...  Years after that confirmed it - only NW6.5SP3 finally got NCPs 
to support for files over 4GB, although you could have such files even 
on NW5.

I believe it was fixed when smbiod was introduced.  When find_request() 
returns failure, it simple throws away data received from network.
Unfortunately NCP does not run on top of TCP stream, but on top of 
IPX/UDP, and so dropping reply is not sufficient - you must continue 
resending request (so you must buffer it somewhere...) until you get 
result from server - after you receive answer from server, you can 
finally throw away both request & reply, and move on.
