This would be an incompat change, but one that would not be hard to
maintain.  The translator stuff looks like the kind of thing that would
_easily_ suit xattrs.

I'm not proposing breaking any compatibility.  The idea was simply that
if we wanted to add new fields to that space in the inode struct, it
would be an incompat change on *all* platforms, not just hurd; and that
on hurd, an extra side-effect of that incompat flag would be that we now
look for translation etc. in an xattr.
Do you know how large the translation data is, btw?  If it's typically
just a small string, then we may actually get far better efficiency by
lumping it into the xattr blocks than by keeping it out-of-band.

The timestamps are about the only things I can think of that would be
safe to ignore.  Everything else --- i_nlinks, i_blocks, checksums,
highwatermarking --- has consistency implications and e2fsck would need
to be aware of it.

Hmm, that should work.  It certainly works nicely for overflow fields.
It might complicate things like highwatermarking: a simple HWM
implementation would record the amount of the file that is actually
initialised in the HWM field, so "0" would actually be an unusual,
important special case.  And "0" would be a potentially valid checksum
if we use CRC32, too.  Using the per-sb field for reserved space, and
the in-inode one to determine which fields are actively in use, would
avoid such ambiguous cases.
