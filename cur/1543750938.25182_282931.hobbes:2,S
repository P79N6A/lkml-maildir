Yours truely is responsible for this code change - it was committed
into "that" CVS tree with these comments originally:
Reference: 13-wm97xx/03-ac97-pm
- Add suspend/resume methods to the ac97 codec plugin driver structure.
- Add code to ac97_codec to allow these methods to be safely called for
  the specified codec.
- Convert ac97_plugin_wm97xx to use these two pointers for its suspend
  and resume hooks.
- Modify pxa-ac97 to call the new ac97_codec suspend/resume functions.
so what you have there is a cut down version of this patch.
If you want an archive of the cvs commit messages for "that" CVS tree,
I can throw you a copy.
