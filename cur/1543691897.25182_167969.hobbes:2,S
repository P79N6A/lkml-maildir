Sure, and I agree that you should have the choice to see
these messages at the verbosity you desire, and ia64 has
the capability to control things in this way.
What I disagree with is spitting out log messages about such things
happening in the kernel.  Because that is remotely triggerable.  As
Alan mentioned, if I can send packets to your ia64 box I can make it
spew system log messages.
