When the device is created, the core calls setup() to get things like
chipselect polarity sorted out and put into the inactive state.   That
matches the board-specific defaults associated with that device, which
would be a function of voltage, routing, and more.
And from then on, it'd be rare to ever call setup() again ... though
drivers certainly could do that between spi_message interactions with
a given device.
