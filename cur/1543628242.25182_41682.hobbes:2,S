So would Linus accept a document on how to run Linux/390 on hercules (yet 
another proprietary emulator)? This also was a FAQ on the linux-390 
mailing list until the documentation is available on the hercules home 
page...
Developing kernel stuff on 390 without emulator can be much fun as host 
operators tend to get very pissed if the IPL ratio comes near to 1/min ;-)
