Damn. A filesystem is supposed to be a way of storing blocks of data by
name - details like MFT records should be purely internal.

We're tracking the block of data, not some internal datastructure of the
FS.

Each hardlink refers to the same block of data. Timestamps and permissions
refer to that block of data.

Each segment of an executable is just part of the block of data. We
operate on a file (as in "block of data") granularity.

We don't subdivide these named blocks of data.

Eurgh. Our resident NTFS expert mentioned this specifically as being a
WEAKNESS in NT's implementation. I would like to think we can learn from
these mistakes, rather than blindly copying them - even if NT IS obvious
and commonly used.

"Whole name" in this context being "the name up to the :"? Strange
definition of "whole" - it could be interesting to see you testify in
court, telling the "whole" truth :-)
Also, where in an MFT record does this "st_nlink" thing live?

Hrm. A chunk of data, in a directory, with a name. We've met those things
before, somewhere...

Eurgh. Why break NFS unnecessarily to add this "feature"?

Eurgh. Do it userside: the kernel provides enough of an API to do it.

If you're meaning HFS's resource and data forks, that's another matter
entirely.

Do it userside. Avoid kernel bloat.

Oh fsck. You want to put "cool stuff like '..'" into regular files? Move
to Redmond.
