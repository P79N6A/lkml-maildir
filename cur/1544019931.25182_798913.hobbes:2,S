The one discussion I saw referencing SCHED_BATCH seemed to imply that it
was a non-standard kernel patch by Con Kolivas in one of his -ck
variants that never made it into mainline and is not being maintained.
Is this inaccurate?
I was unfamiliar with SCHED_IDLE. Having done a little Googling now, I
finally find reference to the man page for sched_setscheduler(2). This
appears that it is likely what I wanted.
I think the information I had been able to find was somehwat out of
date. It had indicated that the only static priority levels were the
realtime ones.
Is there currently a standardized userspace tool to use to run a command
in order to alter its scheduling class? Obviously writing one would be
trivial, but didn't know if something like:
$ runidle ./foldingathome
would be available.
Thanks for your helpful reply.

I made a failed attempt to post earlier in the evening, which included
the address 'nhoyle@no-damn-spam.hoyletech.com'. When that one didn't
make it to the list (though I'm unsure it had to do with the address I
used) I retried with the clean address.  I forgot to remove the note at
the bottom of the posting.
Sincerely,
