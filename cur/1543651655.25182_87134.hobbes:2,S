The delay is required for the PIT. Your AMD-SC520 is simply a bit wacko.
The right way to fix this is actually to switch inb_p to use udelay(8)
and to load a conservative bogomip number at boot time (we inb_p before
we compute udelay values in a few spots)
BTW if your SC520 is broken that way I just broke 2.5.4x support for it
fixing some more standards compliant platforms 8)
