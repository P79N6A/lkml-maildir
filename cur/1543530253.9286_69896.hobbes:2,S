This would entail reserving (in some cases extremely large amounts of)
memory which is never used. This just isn't an itch it is worth scratching
- reserving memory in this way would achieve very little. Particularly in
cases such as WWW servers under Apache, you could end up reserving 1 Gb or
more of swap which you never use - is this desirable at all, let alone
"worth it"??
