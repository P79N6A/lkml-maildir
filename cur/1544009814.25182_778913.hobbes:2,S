Thanks for your replying, David, Valdis and Jesse.

This is a nice software for me, Thanks.

I used this on my environment.
My NICs are 82573L and 82573E. ethregs could detected them well.
It seems that this program doesn't support for writing value to registers.
I think making ethregs to support writing is not bad idea.
If you are not planning, I want to do that.
I'm not a professional of Intel's NICs.
How do you think?
