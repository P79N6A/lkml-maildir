It'd be nice if there were a prototype or something around to at least
get a feel for whether it's worthwhile and how it behaves.
Most of the individual mechanisms have other uses ranging from playing
the good citizen under a hypervisor to just plain old filesharing, so
it should be vaguely possible to get a couple kernels talking and
farting around without much more than 1-2 P-Y's for bootstrapping bits
and some unspecified amount of pain for missing pieces of the above.
Unfortunately, this means
(a) the box needs a hypervisor (or equivalent in native nomenclature)
(b) substantial outlay of kernel hacking time (who's doing this?)
I'm vaguely attached to the idea of there being _something_ to assess,
otherwise it's difficult to ground the discussions in evidence, though
worse comes to worse, we can break down to plotting and scheming again.
