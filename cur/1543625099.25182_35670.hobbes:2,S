Hello all,
I really hope I'm not asking a FAQ, i looked in the archives since 15 Feb
and didn't see anything about this.
I upgraded from 2.2.20 to 2.4.18 on my powerbook two weeks ago, and
compiled ext3 in the kernel in order to quietly crash :)
However, I had about a dozen strange crashes, sometimes when the computer
woke up from sleep, sometimes when launching a program : every visible
soft died, then X, then blackscreen, and the computer didn't even answer
pings. So I reset the computer and here, each time, yaboot (ppc equivalent
of lilo) told me that "cannot load image". Booting and fscking from a
rescue CD showed that superblock was corrupt. 
Of course, nothing in any log :-/
I went back to ext2 three days ago and I do not suffer any crashes since.
Is there a problem with ext3 on 2.3.18 ?
Thanks,
-- 
Colin
