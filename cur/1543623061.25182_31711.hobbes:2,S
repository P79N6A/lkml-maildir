   Anyway, using CONFIG_xxx_MODULE has the problem I describe above.
It actually gets used for all the wrong reasons.
For example, in 2.4.x it is used to keep struct sock from bloating up
in include/net/sock.h unless you have all the protocols enabled.
Whereas with Arnaldo's changes in 2.5.x to split all the non-generic
junk out from struct sock, *_MODULE testing is no longer is needed for
that purpose.
Every existing reference I see in my 2.5.x tree for the networking is
"Duh, delete the ifdef".
