It can probably be made writeable, within limits (caused by zones...)
But the interesting part is that 2.4 tries to estimate how much memory it 
will need shortly (inactive_target) and try to keep that amount inactive 
clean (inactive_clean) - clean inactive memory can be freed and reused very
quickly.
cat /proc/meminfo
My feeling is that, for now, keeping it untuneable can help us in finding 
fixable cases...
