Yes it should be much more than 30kB/s. I remember measuring about 900kB/s.

The "sync" flag is what is killing your performance. It is needed if you 
intend to remove your usb pen without warning, but if you are going to 
unmount carefully you don't need it at all.
Try mounting the device as root somewhere else without the "sync" flag 
and measure the performance that way, to see the difference.
I hope this helps,
