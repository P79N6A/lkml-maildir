I initially thought that may have been a bug, but most of the other arch
iommu code handle it in the same way. I don't think it's a bug, since
they want to clear full page ranges anyway. I should not have changed
this code to take the offset into account - I don't think it's an issue,
but it should have been left as-is. Will do that.

I think because of a two stage conversion, the page variable addition
predates the sg_virt() helper.
