Subject: [PATCH] PCI devid ordering
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
Attached is a VERY small patch against 2.4.8, which I have been sending for
a while.  It merely re-orders one of the PCI device ids - the list was
supposed to be kept in order.
If there is any reason this can't go into the next 2.4.x release, please
let me know.
Tim
