I have a webserver running a rather old 2.6.13.4 kernel that a few
minutes ago surprised me by logging the following message :
 kernel: nfs_update_inode: inode 309229856 mode changed, 0100644 to 0040755
The server exporting the filesystem is running 2.6.18.1 (knfsd) -
nothing is logged on the server...
So a file changed type and permissions out of the blue.  A few
questions about that:
Any way I can identify the file (or is it a dir now ;) ?
Does anyone know if this is a known bug that's been fixed? I couldn't
find anything via google or git that looked like a fix.
