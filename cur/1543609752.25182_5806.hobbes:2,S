If the code you're patching is actively maintained, then no - don't Cc Linus
and Alan on the first attempt. This gives the maintainer a chance to provide
a better patch, argue that no patch is required, or merge it with other
changes which are pending. 
If the maintainer ignores you and you have to resend your patch, include
Linus and/or Alan on the second (and subsequent) attempts.
For code which isn't actively maintained, it's more acceptable to include
Linus and/or Alan on the first attempt.
