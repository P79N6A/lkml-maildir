It's _always_ a trainwreck when I touch anything in the driver core,
look at how many individual patches it took to do a lot of this work
(50+ and still growing).  My method is to introduce the new api, convert
everyone over to it, and then remove the old crappy one.
Now for dealing with external trees, I have _no_ visiblity into them for
the most part.  I can't build s390 stuff (no cross compiler), so I can't
even test their changes.
But, there really should not be that many places that are touching these
types of things that I am currently changing (ksets and ktypes and
subsystems.)
So, how do I do this?  Do I just not let my changes trickle into your
tree, and hold off until I merge them with Linus, hoping that me and Kay
have tested everything good enough?  That way, no build ever should
break, but functionality might not be all working as well as it could
be.
Or we live with some breakage as you pull my stuff into your tree.
Either way, I'm glad to help fix the broken stuff, and I'm also glad to
take the responsibility for getting this all right the first time it
goes to Linus.
What do you think is best to do?
thanks,
greg k-h
