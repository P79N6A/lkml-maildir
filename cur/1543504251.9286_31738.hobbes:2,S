As far as I know that is also standard practice on other Unix raw
devices.  Do existing applications using raw IO on other Unixen really
use unaligned buffers?  I know that Oracle was able to run with the
Linux raw devices without problems.

dd on Linux is at fault, I believe: on Solaris at least, dd uses aligned
buffers.  On Linux, you can use "lmdd" from lmbench which aligns buffers
correctly.

But then the IO isn't strictly raw!
