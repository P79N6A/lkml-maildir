Subject: (2.4.1-ac15) pcmcia irq conflict
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Upgrading from 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.1-ac15 broke pcmcia.
I have a Dell Inspiron 8000. Trying to use pcmcia with kernel
(yenta_socket) or pcmcia-cs only causes pcmcia card to take irq 11,
which my eth device is on also. This didn't happen with 2.2 or 2.4.0
kernels.
What param would I pass (how can I specify) to get yenta_socket to take
say IRQ 9 or 10 on startup?
Thanks
