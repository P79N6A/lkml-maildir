	Hello,
	I don't know if this has been asked before, but searching through old
mail lists is really painfull. My question is the following:
	Is there anyway to disable that anonying messages (which also
introduce some delay) that the kernel reports when trying to access to a
removable disk which is not inserted? For example, I have an internal SCSI
ZIP, and whenever I boot I get three "READ CAPACITY FAILED" error messages,
the question is, there is no way to make the kernel think of removable disks
in the same way that CDROMs? I know it need to know the sector size and all
that important info, but it really need it while there is no disk inserted?
	I do not mean that this feature should be included in the kernel, but
if some scsi guru would tell me if it is possible (or it would totally break
compatibility) I'll patch my own kernel, mainly because I use devfs and
whenever I access /dev/sd the system search for changes in the scsi devices
so I get *lots* of "READ CAPACITY FAILED" error messages. 
	Thanks
	- german
