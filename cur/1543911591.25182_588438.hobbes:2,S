This is indeed related to CPUIDLE.
Tilman: Can you configure CONFIG_CPU_IDLE in your config (under Power
Management option) and double check that the frequency part works after
that.
Andrew: Adam Belay sent a recent patchset on linux-pm and linux-acpi and
one of the patches of that addresses this issue (CPUIDLE: load ACPI
properly when CPUIDLE is disabled). Those patches should come to mm soon
through acpi-test.
Thanks,
Venki
