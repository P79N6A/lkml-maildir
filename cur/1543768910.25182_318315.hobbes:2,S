No, it's a bit different. Let's say disabling interrupts after
boot even for considerable fractions of 1ms is a bug. But then
there are exceptional circumstances where you have no other choice.
In that case you need to use touch_nmi_watchdog yourself.
But these things should be rare, e.g. only in unlikely error
handling situations.

I guess because he's too lazy to rewrite the code use semaphores
and schedule_timeout(). He just needs to get over that.
