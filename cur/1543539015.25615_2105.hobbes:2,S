I believe the man page is refering the situation caused by:
	FILE *f;
	f = fopen("/tmp/foo", "w");
	close(fileno(f));
	/*
	 * f is still a valid FILE * pointer, but the
	 * file associated with it has been closed
	 */
	errno = 0;
	fclose(f);
	/*
	 * errno should now contain EBADF
	 */
	perror("fclose");
Runing the above reveals:
fclose: Bad file descriptor
ie, the behaviour given in the man page.  Therefore, the man page is correct.
I think it is a question of interpretation of the man page, which does say:
       EBADF  The argument stream is not an open stream.
					    ^^^^^^^^^^^
ie, "stream" is still a VALID stream (not a NULL pointer or some other weird
address), as demonstrated in the above program.
