Check out 2.4.3-pre7, I'd be interested to hear what the system time is
for that one.
It does seem like gcc-2.96 is kind of special, but considering how easy
it is to merge anonymous memory (most of the changes were cosmetic ones
to get nice ordering to make the merge trivial without having to
allocate a vma that never gets used etc), it's certainly worth doing.
