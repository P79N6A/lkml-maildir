Subject: [PATCH] no RLIMIT_NPROC for root, please
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Why is RLIMIT_NPROC apllied to root(uid 0) processes? It's not kernel job to
prevent admin from shooting him/her self in the foot.
root should be able to do fork() regardless of any limits,
and IMHO the following patch is the right thing.
