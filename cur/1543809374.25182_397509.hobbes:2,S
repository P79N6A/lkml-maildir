Subject: [PATCH] Cpuset: oops in exit on null cpuset fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
Fix a latent bug in cpuset_exit() handling.  If a task tried
to allocate memory after calling cpuset_exit(), it oops'd in
cpuset_update_task_memory_state() on a NULL cpuset pointer.
So set the exiting tasks cpuset to the root cpuset instead of
to NULL.
A distro kernel hit this with an added kernel package that had
just such a hook (allocating memory) in the exit code path.

+ *    We call cpuset_exit() while the task is still competent to
+ *    handle notify_on_release(), then leave the task attached to
+ *    the root cpuset (top_cpuset) for the remainder of its exit.
+ *
+ *    To do this properly, we would increment the reference count on

+ *    code we would add a second cpuset function call, to drop that
+ *    reference.  This would just create an unnecessary hot spot on
+ *    the top_cpuset reference count, to no avail.
+ *
+ *    Normally, holding a reference to a cpuset without bumping its

+ *    attach us to a different cpuset, decrementing the count on
+ *    the first cpuset that we never incremented.  But in this case,
+ *    top_cpuset isn't going away, and either task has PF_EXITING set,
+ *    which wards off any attach_task() attempts, or task is a failed
+ *    fork, never visible to attach_task.
+ *
+ *    Another way to do this would be to set the cpuset pointer
+ *    to NULL here, and check in cpuset_update_task_memory_state()
+ *    for a NULL pointer.  This hack avoids that NULL check, for no
+ *    cost (other than this way too long comment ;).
