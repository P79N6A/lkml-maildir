The patch drops the conntrack reference when a packet leaves IP to avoid
problems with module unload because of indefinitely queued packets.
The bridge-netfilter code defers calling of some NF_IP_* hooks to the
bridge layer, when the conntrack reference is already gone, so the entry
is neither confirmed (enters the hashtable) nor available for use by
matches or targets. Reverting the patch is not a good option, I'll look
into other possiblities.
