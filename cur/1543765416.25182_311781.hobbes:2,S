Does dmcrypt have a simple operation mode like OpenBSD's encrypted swap?
I want to be able to 'sysctl -w kernel.swap_crypt=1' and get
 * pages are encrypted as they're written to swap
 * the key is automatically regenerated every 2 hours (or whatever); as
   pages encrypted under the old key age out, it can be freed eventually
 * I don't have to manage keys, choose algorithms, futz with /etc/fstab,
   figure out complex configs for /dev/loopN, etc
In fact, I want swap_crypt=1 to be the default (you can turn it off for
embedded systems if you want), but giving me an easy knob is a good
start for 2.6.
Everything I've seen makes me think that configuring dmcrypt is hard.
Don't make users make useless choices.  Sure, there are cases where the
complexity is warranted, but please make the 90% solution easy.
