Hmm, 2.5.x is supposed to guarantee most (if not all) of the
preconditions the code here is trying to (re)establish. Probably the
only use of not ripping out the 4GB spanning code and segment count
checks is to keep driver versions synched. As it stands, this doesn't
compile and if ever invoked the code not needed for 2.5 will not behave
as expected (though thankfully a nop). Maybe a (shudder) #ifdef to rip
out the overhead for 2.5 should be added esp. as post gcc-3.0 probably
can't compile earlier kernels anyway.
