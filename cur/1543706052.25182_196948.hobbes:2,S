I think you talk about a problem I have.
Since 2.6.2-rc2 (I didn't use 2.6.1-rc1-bk3), my mouse turns crazy from time to time, it's during about 2 seconds,
and I get this message in my logs :
kernel: psmouse.c: Explorer Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 3 bytes away.
I think this thread talks about the same problem :
