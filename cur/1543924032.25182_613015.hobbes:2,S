For some time now I've thought the whole ttpci config/makefile setup
sucked.  I've finally gone though and redone it and fixed this problem too.
Here is the patch:  
http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb/rev/5320c2571183
All the rest of the selectors of VIDEO_SAA7146_VV are in the V4L menu,
which contains the necessary dependency on VIDEO_DEV.
Of course the real fix here would be have kbuild not force us to manually
add all the recursive dependencies of a selected module to the dependencies
of the module that selects it.
