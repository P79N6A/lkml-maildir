However they would like to use *abs()? What different ways are possible to 
take the arithmetic absolute value? I see record of many cases where 
dozens of authors have macros that then get collapsed to include files. So 
why not avoid that annoyance this time and -start- with it in the include 
files?
Can there even be any reason beyond unnecessary pedantics to have 
[l[l]]abs?
