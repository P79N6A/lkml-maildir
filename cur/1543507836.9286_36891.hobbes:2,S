This is not true.  There are REAL uses for the call. 
I am currently porting an application from Tru64 with behavior that depends on
the number of CPUs in the system. (For example, How many buffers should I 
allocate?) 
Sure. I can write some code to parse /proc/stat or /proc/cpuinfo.  Tru64 has
the sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) call, and it would be nice if Linux did the
same.  (especially since /proc/ has been known to change...)
Why not have both?  Keep /proc/cpuinfo for the perl script, but use 
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) for the libraries.  Plus, what if people don't
compile with /proc?
