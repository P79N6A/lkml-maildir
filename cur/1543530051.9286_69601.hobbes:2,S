I was seeing crashes in 2.2.15pre9 on my squid box.
But I'm happy to say that this problem seems to be fixed by 2.2.15pre13.
So maybe I was seeing the TCP keepalive stuff under a different guise.
Its been up 8 days under reasonable load.
Thats longer than it ever managed with 2.2.14 or 2.2.15pre9.
It will take a few more days to be really sure.
On a related note, I never had a crash with 2.2.15pre9 compiled with
gcc-2.7.2 instead of egcs. I only tested it for about 4 days so it could
have been a coincidence.
But there may have been a lurking dependancy there.
But whatever it was seems to have been fixed.
