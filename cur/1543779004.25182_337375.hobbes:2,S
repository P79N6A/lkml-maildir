Dear Lennart, Dick Johnson, Erik Mouw & All,
Thanks for all ur precious support. 
The cannon camera (other devices too) formatted SD is indeed a partition
FAT12. When I said 
sfdisk -l, it showed the fs ID as 1. 1 is indeed the FAT12 fs ID.
Attached are the logs for win and camera device sfdisk -Vl /dev/tfa0.
The SD card formatted in camera is partitioned FAT12 disk.
Also, the SD card formatted in windows is partitioned FAT12 disk.
(see the attachment)
on ur suggestion I verified whether camera partition device has a valid
FS ID. I verified. It is FAT12. It is the same for windows 
formatted device. The FS ID of both the formats is 1. i.e. FAT12.
I has notion that my driver is not supporting partition devices. This
makes this clean that my driver is supporting the partition devices
(windows formatted SD). If both are partitioned where is the difference?
So, can someone please help me telling what else could be missing that
is creating this problem?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
