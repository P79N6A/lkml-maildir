[ Of course David will answer for himself better. Below is what I'm
  seeing. ]
David said he intend to port his OLPC and Apple PMU work to battery2
class implementation (and I volunteered to assist, i.e. port them
myself ;-). So, when these two drivers will be ported, then there
will no reasons for battery-2.6 existence anymore.
As for the competition... No competition took place at all, there was
two parallel works, each for two *independent* projects (OLPC and
handhelds.org). battery2 should be suitable for both.
David?
