Nice to know a working patch has been proposed already (alltough not yet 
included in 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 and thus not _really_ fixed). I tested the 
(bugme.osdl.org) proposed patch  and I confirm it works well also on my 
similar but not identical motherboard.
When I see the amount of diverses/stupids anwers I've seen on the 
lm-sensors support page for this same problem on many ASUS A7XXX 
motherboard (
http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/support.html
), I'm glad I 
posted on LKML even with a wrong/hacked fix to get the good one.
Thanks Shaohua,
