Hi,
I have a really strange device conflict that I'd like to report.  I'd be
happy to send more information if needed.
I have an IBM Thinkpad A21m with Linux 2.4.19.  Both the PCMCIA
IDE/Compact Flash adapter and IrDA (syncing to Palm) works perfectly --
separately.  If I boot with the CF/adapter in place, the IrDA does not
work.  If I simply remove the PCMCIA card and re-insert it, IrDA works
again.  If I boot without the PCMCIA CF adapter in place, then insert it
after using the IrDA, no trouble.
Is this a known issue?  If you need logs/configs, just let me know and
I'll send.
Thanks,
Erik.
