  I'm not having that problem with 2.3.25, in fact my box has been
up for quite a while now:
	  4:41am  up  9:38,  1 user,  load average: 1.25, 1.15, 1.04
	USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
	root     tty1     -                 7:04pm  9:37m  1:18    ?     -
  The first thing I do with a new kernel is rebuild my homebrew linux
distribution, which takes 8+ hours or so.  I have a 88K/3630-line
shell-script to do that, and it hangs.
  Pre-2.3.25, it hangs once during build very rarely.  -2.3.25 has seen
it hang twice already.
  Symptoms aren't that useful.  Load at a nice, constant `1', you can't
CTRL-C the window with the build, you have to CTRL-Z it then kill that
background process.  Don't see anything happening in `ps' either.
  It could be that this isn't kernel related and I just happened to win
the random-chance lottery twice today, but before it was rare enough
that you couldn't point a finger at anything.  In this particular case,
the only thing I've changed is the kernel (between 2.3.24 & .25).
