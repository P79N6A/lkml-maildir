Simply post them to the list with subjects beginning with "[PATCH] 2.4: "
so that we notice them. Please CC me because I can easily miss them as
they now represent about 1/2000 of the mails here!
Also, you should ensure that your patches are really relevant to the
usage people have of 2.4 nowadays. If you fix bugs, that's fine. If
you want to contribute new drivers/features, you should first check
that they are correctly working in 2.6 so that people do not get
trapped when they migrate from 2.4 to 2.6, and you should also ensure
that those patches are not only posted for your own convenience ;-)
With all that in mind, please do post your patches, I'm open for
reviewing and discussing them.
Thanks,
Willy
