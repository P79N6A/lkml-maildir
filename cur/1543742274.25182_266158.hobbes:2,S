I can reproduce it using "make oldconfig" in the 2.6.10-rc1
source tree. Just copy my 2.6.9 .config into the source dir,
run oldconfig and accept the default for all questions.
But my .config.gz is 13 KByte compressed. I will send it in a
separate EMail to Adrian only. If anybody else is interested,
please mail.
Regards
Harri
