I'm not sure what it is, but I traded in esd, the sound card, and the
scheduler upon gaining greater insight into this.

A lot of it is the hardware. I haven't looked very hard at the drivers,
but my time/money tradeoff seemed to scream "just get new hardware you
don't have time to look at the code down there". Maybe someone else does...
Any volunteers? I'd at least be willing to run tests. I've seen this too.
