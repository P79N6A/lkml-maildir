Hello,
I'd like to test out the madvise() syscall, to measure the streaming performace
( streaming 50 audio files simultaneously from disk),
as reported in my earlier postings, streaming kills all the buffering
because all other files are removed from the cache by the LRU algorithm.
Sorry for my ignorance but can someone tell me how
to use the madvise() syscall for streaming, 
( which parameters are optimal? )
I'm now mainly working with mmap() / munmap() segments of files
into mem, and it works rather well, except for the buffering problem
mentioned above.
Last question: I'm using RH6.0  , if I run on a 2.3.x kernel + madvise()
patches, will the compiler compile a program containing the madvise() syscall
correctly, or do I need to include some special headers or recompile glibc ?
thank you for you help,
regards,
Benno.
