Software striping will do you nicely, 64bit pci scsi cards are
easy to get.

Or memory map the frame grabber and write to the file - thats how the
existing video4linux rtjpeg tools work

It ought to.

Right now you can set it up so that you DMA from the capture card to
the memory and then write it ought through the buffer cache. Stephen
Tweedie has O_DIRECT patches for Linux (I dont know how tested they are
on Alpha but they survive Oracle on x86 so ..) that willl mean you are
doing DMA direct back out from the same memory
