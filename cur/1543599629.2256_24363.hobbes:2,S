Hello, Linus,
    This patch sets inode.i_blocks to zero on deletion of reiserfs
    file. This in particular cures hard to believe bug when saving file in
    EMACS caused top to loose sight of all processes:
     . reiserfs didn't properly cleared i_blocks when removing
       symlinks. Actually -7 was inserted into unsigned i_blocks field. This
       didn't usually hurt because file is being deleted;
     . inode is reused for procfs and neither get_new_inode() nor
       proc_read_inode() cleared i_blocks;
     . now procfs inode has huge i_blocks field;
     . top calls stat on it and libc wrapper returns EOVERFLOW, as i_blocks
       doesn't fit into user-level struct.
     . top sees nothing.
   Alexander Viro and other people proposed that in stead i_blocks
   should be cleared in generic VFS code. This patch is minimal
   change required to correct bug.
This patch is against 2.4.10-pre2.
Please apply.
Nikita.
