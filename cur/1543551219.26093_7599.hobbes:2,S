Can you tell me (when it is KNOWN) what nasty things does that gcc do to
kernels? The thing that it does not compile vanilla 2.2.x kernels is not its
fault, and if you choose to either use K&R preprocessing in assembly (but
then no GNU extensions) or ANSI preprocessing plus you export memset/memcpy,
it will actually build and work, see H.J.'s patchlets:
http://www.lucon.org/linux/linux-2.2.14-gcc.patch
http://www.lucon.org/linux/linux-2.2.17-library.patch
The fact that we recommend using kgcc (especially for 2.2 kernels) does not
mean that the default gcc is broken, but simply that using it for kernels
has not been tested yet too much and there can be e.g. bugs in the way
kernel uses inline assembly and the likes.

See above, it does not sum up anything. The only thing is that if somebody
is reporting a bug on lkml, he'd just better first made sure it is
reproduceable with kgcc as well (bug reports for kernels compiled with
gcc 2.95 have been handled this way for a long time on lkml).
