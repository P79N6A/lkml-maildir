I don't see that; but I see a lot of Linux types assuming that their
invocation of "Linux" means that only "standard" (whatever that is!)
Linux kernels need apply.
My reading is that the technical types are saying "Linux" to the
marketing types and the general public because they know that "RTLinux"
would only confuse them.
"Linux" is an umbrella, not a monolith.  (And this is a Good Thing.)
