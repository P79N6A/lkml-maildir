Firewall them off. There are also apache hacks for spotting the 
download accelerator device and blocking the user for good.

They will tend to come from older windows boxes, the timestamp/sack stuff
is unrelated

Turning off byte range support in the web server works suprisingly well for
it. Another non hacking code approach would be to set up CBQ or other
bandwidth limiters so that the users of download accelerator get no
benefit. The advantage of the apache hacks is that you can make them
actually suffer
