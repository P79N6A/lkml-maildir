This is not the correct answer. It only catches the case where network cards 
do this. There are lots of other devices which use DMA.
A more sensible answer would be to have the card driver register a
reboot_notifier function, which disables the card just before reboot. 
Is it possible to disable all DMA at the chipset level before rebooting, or do 
we have to tell the cards directly?
