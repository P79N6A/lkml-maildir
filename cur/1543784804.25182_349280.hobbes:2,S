OBP cannot boot because it doesn't understand the ext2
filesystem, and therefore cannot get at the image.
The only thing you can do is netboot kernel images converted
to a.out format using the elf2aout tool.
Stop fighting city hall and work on fixing SILO to support
a 64-bit build if you want, instead of all of these hacks.
