	hi,
	we use 2.1.132 for our nfs client and kernel nfsd (2.1.132) +
	latest knfsd package.
	i never checked until recently, as an ordinary user, i
	chmod one of the directory in /, and it worked!
	the permission for / is dwxr-xr-x
	then, i tried to chmod a+w /fastboot + rm /fastboot
	the chmod worked, while the rm gives EPERM
	despite the EPERM on the 'rm', i successfully edited
	the file.
	is this a bug? in knfsd maybe?
	imel...
