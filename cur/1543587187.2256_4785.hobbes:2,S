f does not imply tick-less is not acceptable, it implies that better process time
accounting is not acceptable.
list organization is not complex, it is a sorted absolute time list.  I would
argue that this is a hell of a lot easier to understand that ticks + offsets.
still, better process time accounting should be a compile CONFIG option, not
ignored and ruled out because some one thinks that is is to expensive in the
general case.
the whole point of linux and CONFIG options is to get you the kernel with the
features you want, not what someone else wants.
there should be a whole range of config options associated with this issue:
CONFIG_JIFFIES   == old jiffies implementation
CONFIG_TICKLESS  == tickless
CONFIG_HYBRID  == old jiffies plus a tickless high-res timer system on
                                    the side but not assoc w/ process and global
timekeeping
CONFIG_USELESS_PROCESS_TIME_ACCOUNTING = old style, cheap time acctg
CONFIG_USEFUL_BUT_COSTS_TIME_ACCOUNTING = accurate but expensive time accounting
this way, users who want tickless and lousy time acctg can have it AND people who
want jiffies and good time acctg could have it.
these features are largely disjoint and easily seperable.  it is also relatively
trivial to do this in such a way that drivers depending on the jiffie abstraction
can be supported without modification no matter what the configuration.
