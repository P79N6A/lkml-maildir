Badari,
Thanks for the comment. The interface does provides some more details
than I will actually need. The intention is to show the possibilities
in the first place, and trim down / expand a bit based on feedbacks.
For the GUI pre-caching stuffs I'm working on, the following features
will be essential ones:
        - file list view
                - sorted roughly on the first access time
                - the size/cached/dev/file attributes
        - page list view
                - the idx/len/state attributes
                - the referenced/active/mmap page flags
Thanks,
Wu
