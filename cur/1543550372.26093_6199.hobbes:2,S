I just purchased a Tyan Tiger 133A motherboard.  For those who haven't heard
of it, it uses the Via Apollo Pro133A chipset, which is ATA66-enabled.  I am
using two maxtor hard drives- hda=20gb hdb=25gb.  They are connected with
ATA66 cable, and are ATA66 capable drives, but they only run at around 2.5
mb/sec (hdparm -t).  Any way to speed these things up?  I've heard they
should operate around 30 mb/sec.  I remember seeing a post about this a
while ago, but I can't seem to find it in the archives.  Any help would be
much appreciated - this upgrade has been hell.
