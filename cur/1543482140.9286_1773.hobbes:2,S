Yes, it's very strange. It runs on the 3 SMP machines I have here at
work. I think it's not the buffers that are getting corrupted, but
the pointers (on the stack). I will print their addresses when the
problem occurs, when I get home from work.

Penguin : Linux version 2.1.131 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
Warning : It's hard to remain at the trailing edge of technology.
Wisdom  : It's not a Y2K problem. It's a Y2Day problem.
