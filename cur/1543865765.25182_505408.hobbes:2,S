We also need ACPI, where available, because that's the only way to 
obtain a BIOS-set hard drive password.  And BIOS vendors often deliver 
hard drive-specific errata this way, if the problem is serious enough 
(though certainly we would prefer that the OS knows about drive errata, 
when a runtime patch is necessary)
