Google still is working but .. (from my bookmarks):
http://cmynhier.blogspot.com/2006/05/zfs-io-reordering-benchmark.html
http://cmynhier.blogspot.com/2006/05/zfs-benchmarking.html
also some other interestig numbers can be founnd on:
http://milek.blogspot.com/2006/08/hw-raid-vs-zfs-software-raid-part-ii.html
Probably more can be find on looking for zfs+benchmark on 
http://blogs.sun.com/
