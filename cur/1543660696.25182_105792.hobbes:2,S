   It's not a kernel problem -- there's something broken in your X
Windows configuration. xdm (or kdm or gdm) keeps trying to start and
fails, and init is restarting it, and it fails...
   Take a look in your X logs (I run Debian and mine are in
/var/log/XFree86.log.0 -- yours may be somewhere else) for the cause
of X not starting.
   Hope this helps,
   Hugo.
