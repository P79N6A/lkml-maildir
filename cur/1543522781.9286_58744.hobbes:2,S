Subject: PCMCIA, lockup in X when hotswapping

pcmcia hotswapping works great at the console but will lock up the machine
solid if you're in X when you do shutdown the network interface and stop
cardmgr.
all recent kernels up to and including 2.3.40pre6, pcmcia in the kernel,
3.1.8 cardmgr.
is this a side effect of something else or can it be fixed?
i had a slight thought about X being chatty on the interface but that
quickly vanished because you can take the interface down and flush all
routing save loopback and X still works dandy.
