We do have some code that looks for unneeded entries.  When found by an
end-user (which confirms that the entry can be removed), it asks the user
to drop us an e-mail so we can remove it.

We generally do strive for such a thing.  Over the years, we've made
several changes to the way the SCSI core works (especially in the probing
department) to allow us to remove all sorts of special-case code and quirk
entries.

It's worth pointing out that performance drops like a stone as this number
goes down.

I think this last point is key.  I'm unwilling to sacrifice error detection
on properly working devices to enable error-prone use on clearly buggy
devices.

As far as I know, Windows doesn't need this because of the way FAT and NTFS
work.  They never use the end of the disk (by more than a few sectors, or
so I'm told).

I agree here.

I've been meaning to start sending e-mails to see if we can get rid of
these.  Most of the devices which required it were UFI, which reports "LUN
not present" in a goofy way.  We fixed the code to detect it properly, but
there are still quite a few devices out there that don't implement the
correct (if goofy) method.
Most of those entries (which are for UFI devices) can go, if we get a
volunteer to take the e-mail addresses listed in unusual_devs.h and work
the list.
