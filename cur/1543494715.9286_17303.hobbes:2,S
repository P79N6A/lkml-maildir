The problem is that if anybody writes code like this, they should be
terminated with extreme prejudice. This is using a gcc compiler bug as
a feature.
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
 int i;
 if(i=foo())
     (void)puts("If this is not seen, it is a compiler BUG!");
 return 0;
}
LCLint 2.2a --- 04 Sep 96
xxx.c: (in function main)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if is assignment expression: i = foo()
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will suppress
  message)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if not bool, type int: i = foo()
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
Finished LCLint checking --- 2 code errors found
gcc 'fixes' obvious coding errors like this. If a compiler fixes
these errors, it should fix the source while it's at it so I don't
have to see them again.
