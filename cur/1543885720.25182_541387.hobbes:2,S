As I said, I hate this barrier (and new complications) too.
We can make the things a bit better:
	- introduce smp_mb__before_spin_lock() // noop on x86
	- then, after some minimal code changes, we have
		set_wq_data();
		smp_mb__before_spin_lock();
		spin_lock_irqsave(&cwq->lock);
		list_add();		
		spin_unlock_irqrestore();

CPU-hotplug can change CPU.

My goal is just rename cancel_rearming_delayed_work() to
cancel_delayed_work_sync(), because now it doesn't require that @dwork
re-arms itself, and it doesn't require to do cancel_work_sync() after.
cancel_rearming_delayed_work() will be obsolete, just like
cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue().
I am strongly against adding many different variants of cancel_xxx().
With this patch the API is simple
	- cancel_delayed_work() stops the timer
	- cancel_rearming_delayed_work() stops the timer and work,
	  doesn't need cancel_work_sync/flush_workqueue

When work->func() re-arms itself, both queue_work() and queue_delayed_work()
may change CPU if CPU_DOWN_xxx happens. Note that this is possible
even if we use freezer for cpu-hotplug, because the timer migrates to
another CPU anyway.

Perhaps yes, but see below.

Sorry, can't understand this. Inserting uses existing lock, namely
cwq->lock.
Just in case, I think wait_on_cpu_work() can check ->current_work without
cwq->lock, but I am not sure yet. We can remove unneeded "new |= " from
set_wq_data(), we can do a couple of other optimizations. However, there
are already _a lot_ of workqueue changes in -mm tree. We can do this later.
Right now my only concern is correctness.
Oleg.
