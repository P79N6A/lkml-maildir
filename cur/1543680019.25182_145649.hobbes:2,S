 Why is that? Isn't uint64_t supposed to be _always_ a 64bit
unsigned integer? Either the kernel or the user space might
be doing the wrong thing...
 I've Cc'd the Alpha mantainer to make him aware of this
problem.

 This is ugly, but there is no way around it. No matter what
typedefs you're using, C99 or not, printf size specifiers are
always bound to plain C types, whose size varies from
platform to platform.

 Yeah, but not if you're lazy ;-)
