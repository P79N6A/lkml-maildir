how should i clean it up? When we allocate a new block we have three
(conceptual) parameters 'got new block', 'block address' and 'error
condition'. I couldnt reduce it further. I did not want to duplicate code
and put a whole block_write_partial|full_page implementation just to be
able to pass bhs to the lowlevel fs. This just hides the parameter passing
problem, N times, into every block-based filesystem. It also eliminates
clean ways to merge the 'clear new block' operation with 'overwrite block
contents'.
