OK, I've found the problem:
1. it does work with init=/bin/bash
2. it did not work after doing a binary search in the modules, even
removing all modules did not help
3. I figured out that it only happens when I update the CPU's microcode,
(booting with init=/bin/bash and /etc/init.d/microcode.ctl start
triggers it)
Even better: s2ram always gave me my display back when s2ram under
console.
Now I wonder if this is Bug #12100 ?
Unfortunately I need the microcode update, as I am suffering from
a) PAT WC disabled due to known CPU erratum.
b) coretemp coretemp.0: Errata AE18 not fixed, update BIOS or microcode of the CPU!
Anyway I now have a chance to test whether #11698 still occurs.
