doing suspend-to-ram should be orthoginal to doing hibernate-to-disk. some 
people will want both, some won't.
at the moment kexec doesn't work with ACPI, that is a limitation that 
should be fixed, but makeing it able to work with ACPI enabled doesn't 
mean that it needs to be changed to depend on ACPI and it especially 
doesn't mean that it should pick up the limitations of the existing ACPI 
based hibernation approaches.
if there is no ACPI on the system it should work, if ther is ACPI on the 
system it should still work.

but don't become dependant on ACPI.
