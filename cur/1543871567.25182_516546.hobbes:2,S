With VMI, I think we came within 90% of getting a cross vendor 
paravirt-ABI that satisfied everyone's needs.  Nobody is smart enough to 
figure out the last 10% - it needs cooperation, trial, error, and 
experience dealing with each other's hypervisors.

Surely, given time, the technical issues can be worked out.  In the 
meantime, the hardware has evolved, and many of the points that are now 
important have changed - and new issues have come into play that we 
can't anticipate yet.  At some point, we will hopefully converge, but we 
might not, and it is a huge job.  UDI had similarly lofty goals.  It was 
started in 1998.  Where is it today?
But this isn't the problem.  The problem is that nobody wants a single 
ABI.  Just like no hardware vendors want a fixed ABI for their 
hardware.  They need to innovate independently, and time to market and 
features are more important than being binary compatible with a bunch of 
competing vendors.  They want to differentiate, and break away from an 
ABI, and as history repeats, again and again, this happens eventually 
with every ABI.
So once the ivory tower is built, and you let all the kids in to play, 
they are going to have a party and you are going to start noticing chips 
and eventually cracks, and eventually the tower will go into disrepair 
and fall because somebody else has built a new and better one further 
down the road.  Why go through that exercise if nobody sees any tangible 
benefit from it today?
Paravirt-ops avoids this because it is an API, and because it is 
flexible, and because it can change with the kernel, and because it 
doesn't lock you into a legacy way of doing things, it allows you to 
fork and adapt and push legacy and future compatibility issues into the 
vendor backend modules, like VMI, where they should belong.
