Nah. This thing regulates what the module has to do when it loads and inits
the firmware, and the whole point of the new behaviour is to get userspace
to be as hands' off as possible, so that we can auto-tune things better
in-kernel, without a need to worry about HAL and friends overwriting local
admin configurations needlessly.
I will probably have to do something like the strict versioned interfaces of
wireless extensions, I think.  It really is a case of a deprecation of
current userland interfaces done sanely.  Right now I am thinking about
giving userland two kernel releases before I change the default interface
level, and one to two years to remove the older ones.
