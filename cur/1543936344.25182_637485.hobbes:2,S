Zach was right. The unification was broken for 32-bit; it was missing
the actual pushf/popf EFLAGS manipluation (set_iopl_mask()) and would've
broken task switching between processes w/ different iopl in paravirt
guests too.  64-bit sys_iopl just does pt_regs->flags modification and
lets syscall/sysret plus ptregscall sync and do EFLAGS update.
Also, use of volatile looks like leftover cruft.
This patch in on top of Miguel's (can respin to standalone if that's better).
Tested (on both 32 and 64-bit) with simple:
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <sys/io.h>
  main()
  {
  	if (iopl(3) == 0)
  		asm ("cli\nsti\n"::);
  }
thanks,
-chris
