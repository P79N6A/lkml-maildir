  Thanks Andrea for replies.
  Yes. i_size has problem that it doesn't show real disk usage and so
is unusable for quotas... i_blocks is what quota needs but reiserfs
has smaller objects than 512 bytes and if we accounted any single object
as 512 bytes it would be too imprecise (some objects are around 40 bytes
or so). So I see no other way than adding another field. If anybody
sees other reasonable solution I will gladly use it...
