Hi All,
I know this question was already asked 1000 times.
My "problem" is that my Dual-Box won't power off itself after a shutdown.
I tried with 
apm=smp-power-off	//no effect
apm=power-off		//this one oopses on boot
I google'd around many hours with no solution.
Has someone a hint for me?
The Box is a Asus P3C-D with two PIII @ 933 Mhz
Thank you
Marc
