Not to mention that the above is all mmx based code, not KNI based code,
and should run on any processor with mmx registers.  This should work
better as a test:
unsigner char a[64];
int test2() {
  __asm__("movups 0x00(%0), %%xmm0\n\t"
          "movups 0x10(%0), %%xmm1\n\t"
          "movups 0x20(%0), %%xmm2\n\t"
          "movups 0x30(%0), %%xmm3\n\t"
          :: "r" (&a[0]));

   Opinions expressed are my own, but
      they should be everybody's.
