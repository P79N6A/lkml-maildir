I get similar errors logged all the time on my CDROM unit.  Any
time a cd player program is running with no audio CD in the CDROM
unit, for some reason, the kernel likes to tell you about it on
every console, and via syslog too.  A real PITA if you use a
snazzy GNOME CD player that runs all the time in the panel.  I've
had to kill all CD programs in order to keep logs to a sane size.
It annoys me enough that I've considered removing all printk's
from the cdrom drivers...  I have no idea what is at fault..
