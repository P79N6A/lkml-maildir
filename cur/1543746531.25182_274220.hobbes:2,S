If you get the permission from the actual authors of the code you use
(in writing) then you don't need to follow the GPL, since the authors
can do whatever they want. But the problem here is, can you track down
all the authors of the said code to get them to write you a permission
slip?

No need to, just ask the authors of the actual code being used.
