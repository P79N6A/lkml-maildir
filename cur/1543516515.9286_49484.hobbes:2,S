Uh, thats bad! (see below)

We are implementing a real-time audio-processing tool which will
support tree-like filter-chains, each filter beeing a thread
and mmaping parts of a global swap-file (the filters passing
data (as pointers to a mmapped area) via sockets).
So is there any way to fix this for 2.4? I dont see how we can
use processes and not loose performace at other places.
Btw, I saw patches floating around which add madvise() - will they
be included before 2.4? They would be really useful.
Richard.
