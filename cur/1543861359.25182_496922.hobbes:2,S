My only concern at the moment is initializing linux's timeofday from the rtc
quickly and with a good precision.  The way it is done currently
in drivers/rtc/hctosys.c is 0.5 sec off.  We could obtain a much better
precision by looping there until the next change (next second for old clocks,
next 0.01 second for m41t81, maybe even better for other ones).

I cannot answer that, but others may have other needs.
