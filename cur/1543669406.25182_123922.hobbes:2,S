Hi.
I have a problem, since I'm using linux-2.4.21-pre6
Sometimes (there seems to be no reason for it) a process
(doesn't matter what process) falls into an
"uninterruptible sleep" while doing something with it.
This problem isn't reproducible or bound to a specific process.
It happens when it "want's to happen" :)
Here an example of a locked kmail:
mb@lfs:~> ps aux | grep kmail
mb       27979  0.2  8.8 43124 22728 ?       D    15:56   0:35 kmail
I'm not able to kill the processes.
I don't know if it is really a kernel-problem, but I think it is one.
Regards
Michael Buesch.
