What resolution are you using? 720x480 with 24 bits per pixel and 25fps 
will use about 25MB/sec on the PCI bus, there is no way you can keep up 
with 8 channels running on a standard 32-bit 33MHz PCI bus which can 
only transfer 133 MB/sec at most. If you need this much transfer rate, 
you likely need PCI Express or PCI-X capture cards or at least a 
motherboard which has multiple PCI buses (which most desktop boards 
don't typically have).
You may be able to reduce the resolution and/or frame rate in order to 
allow the PCI bus to cope. Also, do you have enough CPU and disk speed 
in order to cope with all these streams?
