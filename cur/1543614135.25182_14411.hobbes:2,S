    I always thought they'd like to count the size of disks in bits...
    man, don't you really want on of those new 240Gbit disks?  I hear
    they can pull in a sustained 200Gbit/s on reads!
But what Rik points out shows that right now there is ambiguity
BECAUSE OF LACK OF STANDARDIZATION --- because GB is vague at the very
best, disk manufactures get to claim nice marketing numbers.
As for bits/second sort of thing, this is common in networking of
course, especially when they talk about raw data rate and ignore
framing overhead and such like.
