Which affects this loop:
	/* Wait for the stall to complete. */
	for (i = 20; i >= 0; i--)
		if ((inw(ioaddr + EL3_STATUS) & CmdInProgress) == 0) 
			break;
Your fix will convert this indefinit wait into a bounded one.  It might
cause the driver to malfunction.
Given that our pool of 3c515 testers is less than enormous, a more prudent
change might be to remove `i' and simply formalise the existing behaviour
into a while(1) loop.
