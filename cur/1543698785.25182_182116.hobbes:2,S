That is basically the case. The only difference in the
case of linux(or may be most open source project) is
that, there is no one person or entity(there is
usually more than copyright holder) can say to for
example nvidia that 'ok, your work is not derivative
work' as there is no legal binding in saying so,
unlike a license/contract from Microsoft to them.
So as I said, may be the SCO case can make things more
'formal' rather than this 'you say, I say'.

ps. As a linux user, personally I like to see it the
way you see it as that can solve a lot of those driver
issues but it(driver is derivative work) really is not
convincing for me.
