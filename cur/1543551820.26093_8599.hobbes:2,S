Hi Malcolm,
Since what I am doing is building a raw request, I still get into the
queue as not to distrub things, but I can stomp all over the queue if
needed.  So you are pointing to adding your ring buffer at the request
entry level or at the execution point?
Sorry for being so stupid, I never venture to high in the FS layer.
Cheers,
