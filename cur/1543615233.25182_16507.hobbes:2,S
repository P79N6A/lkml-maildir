Right.  The problem here is that this happens to be at a very early
point in the code (from arch/ppc/kernel/prom.c):
/*
 * Note that prom_init() and anything called from prom_init() must
 * use the RELOC/PTRRELOC macros to access any static data in
 * memory, since the kernel may be running at an address that is
 * different from the address that it was linked at.
 * (Note that strings count as static variables.)
 */
Which is where the trouble comes in.

Right.  There's only a very small number of files which _might_ be
effected by this optimization.
