Doesn't this break mmap() on SPARC?
I thought it was a kernel address, and thus you could use it to memory map
device addresses into user address space. I haven't yet gotten to that part
of the driver, so I'm not familiar (yet) with Linux mmap() entry point.
I do know that there is no hardware reason on SPARC where this wouldn't be
possible. We do Solaris drivers, and provide a capability to mmap() in parts
of the device address space.
