Linux has DMA memory allocation limitation to max. 128K - 24 bytes.
Does anyone know how to break the limitation in driver to allocate more DMA
memory, say 256K?
Thanks!

	The thing that actually worries me here being that all analysis of
potential races was done in assumption that mountpoints never move. Quite
probably your patch *is* safe (with addition of loop check, that is). As
for lookups - yes, you are right. It's not worse than renames (which are
not race-free wrt lookups ;-/) and the same fix will work here too.
	Well, it's 2.3, so... Let's try it and look whether it will give
any troubles wrt NFS. Final word here belongs to Trond and Linus, indeed.
