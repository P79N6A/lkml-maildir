Subject: Real Time Clock driver hangs in 2.2.17

I'm using an old Intel Pentium 90 mb -I think its "Plato". It's worked well 
as a gateway and file server for over two years.
When I boot 2.2.17, the machine always hangs at the Real Time Clock driver. 
Pressing any key gets it going, but this is a remote machine - which makes 
it a real pain.
Without a clue, I ve done the following:
I've put in a new cmos battery
I renamed /dev/rtc to dev/somethingelse ( a suggestion from a ng)
Same problem. Is there a way to fix this? rtc.txt doesn't say much. Can I do 
without it? If so, how do I compile the kernel without it?
thanks
jay
