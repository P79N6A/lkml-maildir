Could you elaborate on this? I almost never use modules for my primary 
desktop system, SCSI emulation support and SCSI generic driver were both 
compiled in, and I had "hdc=ide-scsi" and later also tried "hdc=scsi" and 
I was unable to read from it with any device, /dev/sr0 /dev/sda /dev/scd0 
were all dead-ends, but I was able to WRITE just fine... I just don't 
want to reboot every time I want to write to the drive, nor reboot when I 
want to READ from it.
Disabling ATAPI CD-ROM support, and enabling SCSI CD-ROM (along with SCSI 
emulation support and SCSI generic support) worked, and now I just access 
both my CD-RW drive and my DVD-ROM drive through /dev/sr0 and /dev/sr1.
My primary concern here is other users who haven't figured this out, I 
know at least one ATAPI/IDE CD-R(W) in Linux HOWTO tells the user that 
they'll have to use two seperate kernel images, one to allow reading from 
their drive and the other for writing, infact that was my original method.
