Subject: new IPC mechanism ideas

We are planning to develop a new
IPC mechanism based on shared
memory. The memory is allocated by
a device driver in the kernel
and mapped to various processes
read only. Processes talk to the
driver to write to the memory
but they can directly read the
memory (so its a 1-copy IPC
mechanism). 
We also want to make this IPC
mechanism persistent across
application restarts. So that
if an application crashes, when
it comes back up, it can remap
to its old queues and get its
messages. 
Does anyone have experiences building
such a mechanism ? Any pointers to
reading material would be really
appreciated ?
