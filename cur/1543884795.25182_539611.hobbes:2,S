Adjusting wouldn't be really a problem, if it had some value...

I never said that. Many keyboard _types_ need a separate key mapping.
Localization is a completely different problem (and could be solved via 
separate localization tables).
Most of it can be solved in userspace and we wouldn't have to enumerate 
every possible single key the kernel never cares about in <linux/input.h>.

You still completely ignore the problem of how said application should 
properly support multiple keyboard mappings...
