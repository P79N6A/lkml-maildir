Not altering ->class directly in lldd driver is one major point of this 
whole patchset such that higher level driving logic has a say on whether 
a device is online or not, not the low level driver.  Primarily this is 
useful for sharing low-level codes with hot plugging / EH but it's also 
possible to retry some of the operations during probing in limited cases.

First of all, I'm not a big fan of safety through typedef/structure kind 
of stuff.  For VM, I think it's justifiable, but this class thing 
doesn't involve any complex operation around it.  Drivers just do what 
they do and record the result into the @classes array.  I mean, how/why 
a driver would touch classes[1] when it can recognize only one device. 
It's dictated by the hardware spec and reflected in the driver code.  If 
a driver doesn't get this right, things wouldn't work at all.  @classes 
safety is a minor issue at that point.

No boudnary check is done for accessing ap->device[i] and this is really 
not a place to worry about code size, IMHO.

In ATA, probe and reset are closely related.  There's only one way to 
get class code without resetting - EDD, and it doesn't always work well. 
  That's why the callback is named ->probe_reset.  ATA devices are 
designed to be classfied by resetting them.
