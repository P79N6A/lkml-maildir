Well, if you are using tmpfs as your /tmp filesystem (presumably not
such a strange situation given the name ;-), then any tool which creates
a loopback in /tmp will break.  Good examples would be mkinitrd, or
anything that is generating a floppy image (e.g. Linux Router Project
floppy, boot floppy tools, etc).
