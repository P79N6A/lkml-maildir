These are only informational messages on errors handled by the new code.
You won't see them at the default debug level. I made a few observations
leading me to believe that the number of those errors can be further
reduced, but that will take quite a bit of work.
And there is still a Tx pause of up to a couple of seconds (net watchdog
kicking in) on every GB or so, especially under high load.
