The filesystem in question must have been used with a kernel that was
xattr aware once. You could also have been using ext2. Maybe you ran
selinux at some point, or similar. Can you boot into a kernel with
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_XATTR enabled, and ``getfattr -m- -d -R .'' on the
filesystem in question? This gives you a full xattr dump.
