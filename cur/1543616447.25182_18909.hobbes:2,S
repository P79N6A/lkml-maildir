Looks like a corrupted `next' pointer in the page's buffer_head
ring.  Your report is identical to Todd Eigenschink's repeatable
oops.  
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0112.3/0689.html
In another thread, yesterday, we were discussing the elusive
"end_request: buffer-list destroyed" crash.
I am able to trigger this in around ten minutes on 2.4.13 and
later kernels.  However 2.4.13-pre6 ran the test for nine hours
and did not fail.
I've put the 2.4.13-pre6 -> 2.4.13 diff at

There were VM changes, and a messy, complex and undocumented
change to sync_page_buffers(), which was the point at which
I ceased to understand that function.   The patch was never Cc'ed
to the mailing list, was never explained.  This sort of thing
makes it very hard for other developers to hunt down bugs.
Probably, the bug lies elsewhere and perhaps my bug is different
from yours and Todd's.  It is timing-related, and the VM and
buffer changes may just have triggered it.
I have a debug patch from Jens to try tonight.
It could just be some random memory scribbler.  Dunno yet.  It's
awfully repeatable.
