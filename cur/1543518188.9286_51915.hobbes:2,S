Subject: memory_start doesn't exist (x86, init/main.c)

In main/init.c around line 487, there is a comparison initrd_start <
memory_start.  memory_start doesn't seem to exist anywhere in iX86
land.  I have initrd enabled, so I can't compile 2.3.30.
I grepped for this variable, but can't find anything in the x86
architectures that sound right, but found hits in other architectures.
