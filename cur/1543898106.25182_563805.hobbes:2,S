like this:
$ eu-readelf -l /bin/true  | grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x000000 0x000000 RW 0x4
(replace /bin/true with the binary or library you want to check)
if it says "RW" like here, it'll have non-executable stack. If it says
"RWX" or if this line is absent entirely, the stack will be executable.
