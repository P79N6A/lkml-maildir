Subject: How does RAID work with IT8212 RAID PCI card?

Hello everybody,
i need some advise regarding the usage of the above kernel module. Today i 
have plugged a PCI RAID card into my computer, IT8212 chip on it, and two 
identical hard drives on the primary and secondary master of that controller. 
In the controller BIOS i defined a mirror set out of those both disks and 
booted linux afterwards.
Loading the kernel module dmesg showed that the controller was found and that 
2 harddiscs are attached to it.
The thing that i wonder about is, that i still can "see" both harddisks 
independently, but i would expect to see only one harddisk at all, that 
represents the RAID set. Udev also registers /dev/hde and /dev/hdg, but (as 
far as i can see) no further device.
Is there anything wrong about my setup? Is this i driver issue? Or is this the 
normal and expected behaviour and its me who doesn't "use" the module 
properly? How to i access the RAID set instead of the two seperate disks?
Thanks in advance. Yours sincerely,
Christian Haertwig
