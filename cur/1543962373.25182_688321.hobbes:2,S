Seems to make it stutter a little less - but still not usable.

No significant difference from NO_NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS that I can tell.

I would say no - the audio still is unusable - slightly better with
NO_NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS, no difference with the other.
But per Mike's suggestion if I disable CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED ,
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED and CONFIG_USER_SCHED, even with
NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS audio is good again, which does not change with
NO_NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS. (No skips for long time under -j8 - still skips
a _very_ tiny bit - noticeable if I listen too carefully - but we can
ignore that for the time being.)
Mike -  the GROUP_SCHED stuff is set to y in the Ubuntu kernel and I
have no audio skips - may be a regression introduced after 2.6.24?
But why is the GROUP_SCHED stuff default y if it so unusable?

I see Frans already reported that and there was some conclusion - let
me know if more data will help.
Thanks!
