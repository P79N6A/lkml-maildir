(Oops, I think I sent this via private mail last time, instead of to the
list.)
I've also seen problems with the preempt patch and PCMCIA/CardBus, on my
Dell Inspiron 5000e. The top CardBus slot doesn't work for me with the
preemption patch (in fact, if I have a card in there, sometimes the
machine freezes at the point in boot when it would normally detect the
card). It usually doesn't even see that I've put a card in there. I don't
remember trying the bottom slot instead of the top though.
I just never got a chance to report the problem, until now. This has
happened with a range of kernels (I think I first tried the preempt patch
back around 2.4.14pre and I last tried it with a late 2.4.17-pre or with
2.4.17-rc1.)
