I am a bit frustrated because when I first objected to 250HZ as the
default, I was told to come up with some numbers.  Now we have the
numbers, and they overwhelmingly show that 250HZ WILL hurt interactivity
and WILL NOT save anyone any power in real life.  But now the 250HZ
people have changed their position to "yes, we KNOW we're screwing over
multimedia users for the sake of laptop users, and we DON'T CARE about
your numbers."
