You'll get that when the filesystem support for capabilities goes in.
Alternatively, tighten up the bounding set as part of your system
initialisation scripts.

It feels like functionality for the sake of it. The capabilities stuff
already has a few bells and whistles, not to mention complexity. And very
few people are using it. I'd be happier to just fix the remaining serious
capabilities bug identified, and then let people _use_ the stuff in
2.4. Hopefully distro's themselves will ship lower-privileged daemons.
Once we've got some proper, extensive _real world_ use of capabilities,
we'll be in a better situation to evaluate what tweaks/additions are
required. Quite a lot of capabilities complaints boil down to
"theoretically, this could be an issue" rather than "I've been using
capabilities to do X, and came across this issue"
Cheers
