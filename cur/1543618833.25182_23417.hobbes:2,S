This is not ENTIRELY true.  Certain hangs and crashes can be caused with
X, APM, and APIC enabled.  I haven't entirely tracked it down yet, but I
have seen it on a Thuderbird 800 (FIC SD11), an Soyo Dragon Plus (1800+
XP), and a few others.  It goes away if you turn Local APIC's off.  This
may be related to some video card issues, but I don't yet know.
