Most of this:
#if defined(__mc68000__)
...
#elif defined(__mips__)
        pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot) &= ~_CACHE_MASK;
        pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot) |= _CACHE_UNCACHED;
#elif defined(__sh__)
        pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot) &= ~_PAGE_CACHABLE;
#elif defined(__hppa__)
        pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot) |= _PAGE_NO_CACHE;
#elif defined(__ia64__) || defined(__arm__)
        vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vma->vm_page_prot);
#else
#warning What do we have to do here??
#endif
exists because architectures haven't defined their private
pgprot_writecombine() implementations, preferring instead to add
to the preprocessor junk instead.
