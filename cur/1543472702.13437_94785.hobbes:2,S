For a simple test, you could simply apply the patch, recompile, and 
see if anything changes for you. No change is good news then. I'm 
sorry for the lack of documentation, but you could get some of the 
recent PPSkit-0.3.*.tar.gz which include a little more information.
There's really a problem, that glibc2 lacks working NTP API 
functions. I don't have recent sources yet, but maybe I can provide a 
patch soon...

There's also a so-called "FAQ" there that includes some of the 
interesting questions and answers from the newsgroup
