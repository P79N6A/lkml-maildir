This makes sense.  FUTEX_FD was for the NGPT project which did userspace
threading, and hence couldn't block.  It was always kind of a hack
(although unfixably racy isn't quite right, it depends on usage).
However, the existence of FUTEX_FD is what made Ingo complain that we
couldn't simply pin the futex page in memory, because now a process
could pin one page per fd.  Removing it would seem to indicate that we
can return to a much simpler scheme of (1) pinning a page when someone
does futex_wait, and (2) simply comparing futexes by physical address.
Now, I realize with some dismay that simplicity is no longer a futex
feature, but it might be worth considering?
Cheers,
Rusty.
PS.  I used to have a patch for "ratelim_printk()" which hashed on the
format string to reduce the chance that one message limit would clobber
other messages.  I'll dig it out...
