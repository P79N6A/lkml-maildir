No. You acquire the lock with irq disabled as usual.
If you are not been succesfully in grabbing the lock you go to the slow
path where you don't try to grab the lock each time to not ping pong the
cachelines everywhere and to not flood the bus with lock signals. During
such loop you can enable irqs.
