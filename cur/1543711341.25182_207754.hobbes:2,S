I think we want to preserve the existing behaviour rather than change
it.  We really do want to request the device resource against its
immediate parent because that is the way PCI works - if a devices
resources don't fall within the parent bus resources, we want to
know about it.
May I suggest that ia64 sets the parent bus resources appropriately,
which should relieve this problem (iow, pci_root_bus->resource[0..3])?
If pci_find_parent_resource() is returning the wrong thing, its likely
that other users of this function will also be getting the wrong answer.
