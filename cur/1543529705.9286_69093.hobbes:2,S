Regardless of whether this works or not, they are NOT unused, therefore
this is wrong...  From a maintenance standpoint, somebody might come
through the code, say "hmm this is unused eh?" and delete it.  From a
gcc standpoint, the compiler might change such that __unused__ code is
never output, which would be equally bad.
