This is a report of a suspicious message that is not really a problem, as 
far as I can tell.
With both 2.4.20-pre10-ac1 and 2.5.41 on an A7V266-E MB, hard drives hooked 
up to the VIA vt8233 IDE controller, on bootup messages about hda: DMA 
disabled appear, but as far as I can tell, it's not disabled, at least not 
by the time I can log into the system, and copying /proc/ide/via to /tmp 
right after / is remounted rw shows that it is UDMA enabled at that point.
This is a rh7.3 system.  I've tried to rule out that hdparm or sysctl is 
being run somewhere.  Nothing appears in rc.local or one of the scripts in 
/etc/rc.d/init.d.  /etc/sysctl.conf doesn't seem to have anything that 
would enable DMA, and USE_DMA=1 is commented out in 
/etc/sysconfig/harddisks.
Once the system is up, DMA appears to be enabled on hda.  /proc/ide/via 
shows it enabled, and bonnie++ gets good throughput (higher than 2.4.19 on 
sequential reads, slightly slower on writes).
If what's happening is that DMA is being disabled, then enabled, maybe 
either the disabled message should be removed or a message that it's being 
enabled should be added, because right now it looks rather suspicious.
Thanks,
Bruce
The messages that appear on bootup look like:
