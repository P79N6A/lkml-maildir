Mr. Victor,
    I've refrained from replying to your previous attacks on C++ but you continue to persist in a habit of
comparing C code with C++ code that is functionally and semantically different. The fact is that the ONLY
difference between a struct and a class in C++ is that classes have a default private scope for all its members.
In all of your examples I can recall you insist on declaring the methods as virtual yet you don't bother to write
code in your C example to support the same functionality (FYI - your C example is not an example of the
capabilities of a virtual call). Why do you insist that C++ methods be declared virtual?!?!? Additionally cout
and printf are no where near the same. If you want a direct comparison go ahead and use printf in your C++
examples or else you should implement a iostream capable equivalent of printf (not likely). All of your code
comparisons are examples of ignorance of C++ or plain intellectual dishonesty. Its also getting way offtopic
(which is why I even now hesitate to post this) because we've left behind the issue of linux kernel issues and
how the language features apply to it.
    thanx & later,
        Ben Scherrey
