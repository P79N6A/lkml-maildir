Thanks for the pointer Ted.  I've looked through the drivers/char
directory but I must be blind because all I see other drivers doing is
setting tty->closing = 1 (and then = 0 later) and
ldsic->flush_buffer().  Is flush_buffer() what you're refering to?  The
tty->closing variable just seems to prevent the ldisc from reading.
