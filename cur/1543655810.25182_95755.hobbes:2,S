The DRM updates are causing a lot of problems like this for software
that needs hardware support. The updates were merged into Alan's tree
after 2.4.20-rc2-ac2 and are still somewhat present in 2.4.20-ac2. On my
Radeon Mobility, GL-based apps wouldn't even start.
Arjan was fixing DRM all over the place a while ago, but not
lately. Notably the Rage 128 support was fixed by him, and the Radeon
support to some extent.
