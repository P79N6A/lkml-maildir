An ide dvd drive on my system is getting into an unusable state, which is cured
by reboot. When it's mucked up, I get endless messages as follows, and
processes accessing the drive remain in uninterruptable sleep for several
minutes.

The drive remains unusable until reboot. I've tried reloading the kernel
modules (cdrom, ide-cd) and issuing "hdparm -w", both of which have no effect.
Momentarily ejecting the disc sometimes allows it to work for a bit, but
rebooting seems to be the best workaround.
 
I see in the archive that there have been posts about these error messages, but
I didn't find any replies that address them. Is there a faq somewhere that
covers this?
The kernel is the redhat kernel-smp-2.4.18-24.8.0 release. The mainboard is an
Asus P2B-D (IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 1)).
Any ideas?
