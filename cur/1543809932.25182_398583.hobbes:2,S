I would think that the model, manufacturer and serial would be useful, 
and just the indication that the device was CD capable would be a huge 
gain. There are at least two more type of drive coming soon in the 25GB 
media race, so identification could legitimately be left to the 
application as long as all CD-like devices can easily be identified for 
examination.
Does that fit with your level of available time (and interest in 
resolving this issue)?
