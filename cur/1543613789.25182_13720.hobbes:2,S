Ehh. What if I don't want (let's say) I can't pay money for a DVD player
software? Is there any legal DVD player sw for Linux? For win it's not
solution for me since win is not legal unless I buy it :) So I can't watch
my own DVD disk according the law? Imho it's against the constitution of
most countries: if I beleive that Open Source is the RIGHT solution (let'say
this is my religion, namely: I beleive in freedom so I can only use open
source softwares :), then I can't watch DVDs. So I'm under detrimental
distinction because of my religion. Hmm ;-( [sorry it's very OT maybe some
linux-kernel-flame mailing list should be created, like linux-flame mailing
list in Hungary :)]
