If you cannot write your log files to disk then you have three options.
(1) Write the oops down by hand and type it in later.  Some people have
    photographed the screen to get it right.
(2) Use a serial console (Documentation/serial-console.txt) and capture
    the data on a second machine.
(3) Use one of the patches that save the logs to video RAM or a floppy.
