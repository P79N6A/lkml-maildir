Thanks for these untenable guesses ;-)
LVM2 and the device-mapper are GPL/LGPL.
Sistina decided to offer this to the community and to keep it under
the FSF licenses.
This has been stated on the Linux LVM lists before.
OTOH we need to survive as a company and therefore will implement
comercial enhancements which will BTW enable us to do support and
further development of the above free software.
