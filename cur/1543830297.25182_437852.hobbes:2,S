Ah, Ok.
I changed this patch as you said.
At first, I thought it might not be good that config memory hotplug was
disabled by config sparsemem. Because, they are not strictly the same. 
But, this is reasonable way for 2.6.17.x. It is less impact, anyway.
Thanks.
------
Memory hotplug code of i386 adds memory to only highmem.
So, if CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not set, CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG shouldn't be
set. Otherwise, it causes compile error.
But, CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is defined mm/Kconfig. So, if it is disabled
on its file when arch is i386 and highmem is not set, 
it may be a bit intrusive.
When CONFIG_SPARSEMEM is not set, its config option is not set too.
CONFIG_ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE is defined in arch/i386/Kconfig.
Disabling it is not intrusive for other archtecture.
This is patch for it.
