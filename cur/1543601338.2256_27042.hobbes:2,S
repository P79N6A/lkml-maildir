For a user space program you could just read /proc/cpuinfo, I'm
actually writing a kernel driver, maybe I wasn't clear enough.  I'm
just frustrated because the variable I'm after, cpu_khz is already
calculated at boot time (that's where /proc/cpuinfo gets its data) and
that variable doesn't appear to be exported to the rest of the kernel,
either that or I'm just missing something, which I would rather be the
case at this point.
