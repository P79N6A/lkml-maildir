I disagree.
(1) Some systems use per-user groups and create all files group-writeable
by default, i.e., they set the umask to 002. If you want to be user-friendly,
you should respect this setting, so the permissions in the tar archives you
distribute should be 666.
(2) People extracting random archives as root with preserving permissions
(and owners) are relying on *ALL* archive creators using what they suppose
are the right permissions, which is at least simple-minded, if not completely
silly. If you want to help such users, you should do so by helping them
understand they do a wrong thing and not by hiding the problem in a single
specific case.
				Have a nice fortnight
