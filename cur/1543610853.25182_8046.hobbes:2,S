Actually the comment is a bit misleading.
We've called block_prepare_write(), which has done the kmap.
But even though block_prepare_write() returned success, this
call to the filesystem's ->prepare_write() is about to fail.
So the caller of ->prepare_write() isn't going to run ->commit_write(),
and we have to undo the kmap here.

There have been a number of mistakes made over this particular kmap()
operation.  NFS client had it wrong for a while. I think sct had
some proposal for making it more robust.
