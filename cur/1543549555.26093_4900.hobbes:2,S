Hi Rik.
I hope you will find another similar bug. -test9-pre6 with your VM fixes
had been working for 27 min for me and then the very similar stall 
happened as it was with your -vmpatch'es. After pressing reset button, fsck
was frozen during booting (his progress bar stoped) 
and I've seen such fsck behavour since your -vmpatch'es against -test8. 
I suspect you didn't fix all (gfp_mask & GFP_IO) cases.
I'd like to see your patch in the kernel but it's still buggy.
