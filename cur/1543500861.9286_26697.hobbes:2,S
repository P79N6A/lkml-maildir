There is no standard routing filter to simulate varying latency (as
caused by modems with compression and big buffers) or a realistic packet 
drop model (the token bucket filter lets through bursts). So I doubt 
it'll be very realistic. A WAN Emulator has very different goals from
a simple bandwidth limiter.
