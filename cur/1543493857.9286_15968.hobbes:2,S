It doesn't. It just displays data tracks, but (at present) can't
access them.

Hmm...(imho) that would need redesigning complete isofs code and adding
audio support for it. If it's possible (isofs uses normal
bread, audiofs passes calls to cd ioctls) at all...

I don't think so. VFS "locks" mounted device (afaik). One could do fs
emulation that bypasses VFS but that would be a really ugly hack.

I think the easiest (but probably not the best) way to do it is
that audiofs would read data tracks, and then those tracks
(files) would be mounted using loopback device...
