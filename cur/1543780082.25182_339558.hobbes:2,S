hm, i currently have "acpi=off noacpi noapic reboot=b" as kernel
parameter.
if i remove the acpi stuff and enable acpi, the usb mouse works fine..
but after some time (5-10min) the kacpid process goes havoc and eats
all cpu and the whole system is unresponsive- that's the reason i added
those acpi=off parameters the first time when installing gentoo..
i tested with gentoo-2.6.12-r7 and vanilla-2.6.13rc5
