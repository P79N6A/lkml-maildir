Excellent - this solved my problems.  I stress tested the loopback device
with a big copy and it seemed to work.  I also made losetup use open64:
[root@crush mount]# diff lomount.c lomount.c~
230c230
<       if ((ffd = open64 (file, mode)) < 0) {
---
>       if ((ffd = open (file, mode)) < 0) {
and gave it a 10GB file.  This seems to be working fine as well.
