Hi Mathieu,
Thanks for your comments, mine below...

Yes and no.  For the binary tracing parts, there probably is some
overlap with LTTng.  But since there's no LTTng in the kernel, we do
without it.

DTI doesn't use a global channel either - the 'merged views' present the
data as if there were a global channel, but logging to the channel is
still per-cpu.
As for text-based tracing, of course I agree it's not the most efficient
way to do tracing, but from my perspective, it's probably the most
useful part of DTI.  I'm continually getting mail from people saying
'the relay API is just too hard to use' or 'I just want to log some
data, I don't want to know jack about debugfs' or 'I just want to log
some data, I don't want to know jack about merging per-cpu files'.  DTI
in my opinion (the other authors may disagree) is mainly about making
those things as easy as possible and providing a more usable API for
kernel debugging - one line of code to set things up, dti_printk() calls
to do per-cpu logging, and at the end, a cat of a single file to see the
merged results.  I don't know how to make it any simpler.
But DTI can also log binary data if needed, and it's not that hard to
write a quick-and-dirty post-processing converter to present it nicely
(or the one-size-fits-all dtiprint utility can be used to look at any
trace).  The emphasis I think is on 'quick-and-dirty' - LTTng is
targeted at production systems and therefore goes to a lot of trouble
making sure that users can do everything they need to without ever
having to reboot.  With DTI, a reboot is pretty much assumed, so there's
no extra data definition layer to worry about - just define the data you
want to log and make sure you have the same thing on the other side when
you want to make sense of it.
Anyway, every so often someone posts a debugging tool similar to DTI -
DTI is basically an attempt to try and make a lot of that effort
unnecessary by making relay easier to use for ad hoc debugging; in fact,
the relay_kernel_read() used by the merged views was something I wrote a
couple of years ago for logdev and that IIRC that was using it for the
same purpose.

complete_channel() doesn't fail silently - if it's in an unsafe context
for allocating a channel, it does it in a work queue.  So yes, you'll
miss some events at the beginning.  If that's a problem, you can use the
low-level interface for the channel (or maybe there should be a flag on
DEFINE_DTI_HANDLE() that has it created immediately).

Why would they be jumping randomly?  Here's output from the early boot
example - I don't see any random jumping:
[    0.000000][0]first statement in start_kernel()
[    0.000000][0]after smp_setup_processor_id()
[    0.000000][0]before tick_init()
[    0.000000][0]after tick_init()
[    0.000000][0]after boot_cpu_init()
[    0.000000][0]after setup_arch()
[    0.000000][0]after smp_prepare_boot_cpu()
[    0.000000][0]after sched_init()
[    0.000000][0]after page_alloc_init()
[    0.000000][0]after init_timers()
[    0.000000][0]after hrtimers_init()
[   54.947609][0]after time_init()
[   54.950886][0]after console_init()
[   54.979736][0]after locking_selftest()
[   55.062384][0]before rest_init()
But I'm quite sure you know a lot more about foolproof timestamping than
I do, and that it's all encapsulated in something like an
lttng_timestamp() that I could grab out of lttng?

Again, please point me to an lttng_timestamp() that I could use if this
is a problem.
The reason we do it at all is that we want the events to be available in
the normal relay channel after the system boots up instead of as some
special add-on to relay.  Doing it with a single static buffer seemed
like the simplest thing to do both from a user and implementation
perspective.
