Exactly my point.  For me to make such a disk that I currently make, I
basically:
make oldconfig
make zImage modules
kmodinst <dir for modules>    This is a small sh script I wrote from the
                              modules_install target in the Makefile
cp System.map /<dir>/boot/System.map-<kver>
cp arch/i386/boot/zImage /<dir>/boot/vmlinuz-<kver>
change to that boot dir
rdev <kernel> /dev/nfs
rootflags <kernel> 0
foreach floppy I want to create, I cp <kernel> /dev/fd0
With initrd support?  Putting kernel on there would require (on a new
floppy, above is a non issue).
mkfs /dev/fd0
mount it
cp <file list> /floppy
cp <kernel> /floppy
lilo -C /floppy
If I want to find out what kernel I'm running (currently)
less -f /dev/fd0  then hit space.
New way.
mount it
less -f <kernel>
unmount it
Does put a considerable overhead to do this.  Or to me it does.  I use this
senerio to load windoze machines.  It works for me.  Some times I use them
on low memory machines.  Most of the time, I'll compile the kernel at home
(compare a dual pII450 [home] to a dual p5-233mmx [work].  Difference
including download is considerably lower on the home box).  I have a nice
little tar file made up that'll untar in the base dir with the modules, and
kernel where I want it.
