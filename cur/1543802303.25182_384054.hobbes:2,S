With two ice1712 cards I had to patch jackd for MMAP_COMPLEX
support to make them work together. My understanding was that the
individual cards use interleaved data, but when several are combined
the resulting blocks of data are not interleaved together. I realise the
usual way of dealing with this is to use the alsa route plugin with
ttable to interleave them, but I couldn't get it to work with these
cards.
