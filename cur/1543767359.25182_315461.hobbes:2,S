I'm not sure, bit I don't think that this is a kernel issue. There too many 
other parts which can affect this.
Please give some more information to see where the problem is:
- have you tried another kernel (other version, vanilla sources, whatever)?
- have you tried different streams?
- have you used another player (other version of xmms)?
- have you used another output plugin (oss, alsa, arts / esd)?
- dou you can open the same stream via xmms directly?
- is there any output on dmesg which could confirm that it is a kernel issue?
Maybe you want to ask Google about the problem, browse through the xmms 
mailinglists...
my 2 cents.
Manuel
