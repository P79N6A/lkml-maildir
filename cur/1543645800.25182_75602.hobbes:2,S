DM is small and clean because it's severely lacking in functionality.
Last I checked it couldn't do RAID 5 or r/w snapshots without
completely bypassing its core infrastructure (since you're no longer
just doing simple block remapping at that point), and once you add all
that stuff, it's likely to become much more complex.
