Do we want to add yet another file operation entry?  Especially when
the *only* different between the two cases is whether to use user or
kenrel mappings.  I added FMODE_KERNBUF to the filp mode flags, normal
code does not set this flag, vmdump sets it when creating its dump
filp.  sd_raw_write looks at that flag and maps the kiobuf accordingly.
We already use the f_mode flags to decide if we are doing read or
write.  Adding another flag for user vs. kernel seems the smallest
change and is compatible with the current usage of f_mode.
