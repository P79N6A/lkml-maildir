Hi, guys,
How to effectively disable a PCI device so that the resources are not 
allocated to it? For example, is it possible for me to provide pci id at 
boot promt or somewhere else so that I can bypass the device, such as 
some usb controllers. I am using linux kernel 2.4.20.
Thanks in advance,
jing
