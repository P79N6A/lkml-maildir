I've put up 2.2.0pre7ac1 on
	
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2pre/...
Its mostly a standstill patch versus 2.2.0pre6ac1 - just the stuff I didnt
get merged with Linus - but a few small items have been added. ac2 will
follow some time later with the stuff from the pending pile.
Differences between 2.2.0pre7 and 2.2.0pre7ac1
o	Config help for Apollo and for INITIO scsi
o	Large fd arrays (100,000 per process!)
o	Console font handling fixes in 512 char mode
o	Lance allows compiling as a module
o	EEPro100 has byte counters
o	Some shaper bug work - still doesnt work in 2.2.0pre
o	Symbios 53c416 support
o	QlogicFC fibre channel controller support
o	Problems with certain numbers of disks fixed
o	PAS2 and SB sound fixes
o	Swap/page size header stuff handled right
o	NFS client knows about BSD style FIFO rule
o	Memory locking fixes for /proc
o	AVL tree VMA handling for speed when running debug tools
o	Root-dev sysctl works for both endians
o	IP masquerade bug fix for ICMP masq
o	NFS over TCP mostly works
o	Xconfig fixes
o	IPI counter on SMP
o	ver_linux script improvements
Oh yeah I left some I2O references in in error. Just say N to those 8)
