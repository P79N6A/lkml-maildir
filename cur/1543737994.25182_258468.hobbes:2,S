I don't think that is the point of UDP and I don't think the kernel should
do that, but there are two options for handling this:
If recvmsg() blocks until valid data is available then so should select().
If recvmsg() returns an error on invalid data then select() would indicate the
socket() as ready without knowing if the data was valid.
