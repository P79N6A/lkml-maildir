Friendly users are no problem at all. Use vfork() and threads often.

What would you call the SHARC? (from Analog Devices)
There is a near-POSIX multitasking OS that runs on the SHARC.
The OS and all apps are written in C, C++, Ada, or FORTRAN.
Apps make library calls to take advantage of DSP features.
(the library is full of vector math operations)
Oh yeah... this is for a multicomputer with a Linux-sized kernel.
For the anti-DIPC people out there: you can do hundreds of nodes
on this system, and shared memory is faster for small transfers.
Doing MPI for 8 bytes is a definite loss.
I'd say more, but I'm not sure what else is public.
