Your argument is correct, but this is data generation rather than
analysis. In doing simulation it's desirable to ensure that multiple
instances of a program don't use the same numbers.
For instance, simulating user load against a server; I want the
simulation of human thinking time to be a number in the range n..m and
not to be the same for all threads. Sure I can get around that, and do,
but I wouldn't mind having a simple source of random bytes which was
quality PRNG and unique.
Again, this is not a case that this is a "must have" feature, just an
opinion that there are benefits to having such a feature which don't
apply to the cases you cited above.
