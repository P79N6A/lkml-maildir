I'd compile 2.2 and 2.4 kernels with most conservative settings,
put them on a diskettes and try at several PCs.
No, not a full Linux, just a kernel. 
That way you can collect some data as to which PCs do
not like 2.4
Also you can stick debugging in the early boot stages
and investigate.

If you have/can install DOS, you may use this bootloader
for debugging. It is small and source is easy to understand
(I hope)

You need *devel.tar* file only if you don't have Borland C,
otherwise take much smaller linld095.tar.bz2
