Hello,
the fix for this bug in 2.6.11-rc3 for this bug is wrong, I thought I
posted the right one (that I already applied to all SUSE branches except
the HEAD branch that probably is in sync with the inferior fix in
mainline). Right fix is the below one. And then of course drop those
useless -PAGE_SIZE in change_page_attr p->size parameter in the arch
code. Exposing vmalloc.c internal knowledge of the guard-page-size into
the arch code is an unnecssary breakage of the vmalloc abstraction and
I've been very careful to avoid that and I thought I posted it too. It
has been even quicker to fix it right for me in a single place than to
hand edit the (not single) change_page_attr callers. I'd like the right
fix to obsolete the hand editing of arch code in multiple places that
breaks the layering. Thanks.

 and hide the guard page from the callers like ioremap - this avoids
 a kernel crash due one more page being passed to change_page_attr
