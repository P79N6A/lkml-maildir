Good question. It depends if the Microsoft ftp client is streams-aware,
and understands the Microsoft OLE structured storage format and will do
the linearisation on demand or not. I must confess I haven't tested this,
as I don't ever run Windows other than on vmware sessions for Samba testing
these days :-).
Probably a non-Microsoft ftp client would lose part of the word doc.
