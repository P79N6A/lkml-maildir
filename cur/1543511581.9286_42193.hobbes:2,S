Under a 2.2.12 kernel I have a CDROM which won't unmount.  Symptoms
It isn't in /etc/mtab (doesn't show up under a /bin/mount)
It is in /proc/mounts
When I try to /bin/umount it is reported as device busy
/usr/sbin/fuser -u -m     reports no users on the drive
/usr/sbin/fuser -v        reports that the kernel has the drive mounted
I can read the files on the CDROM, I just can't unmount it.  This may be
due
the fact that VMWare has been run on this machine (tho it is not running
presently).  In any case, it would be nice to have a way to force the
mount
and usage status of a drive to be made consistant.
Anyone have any ideas?
