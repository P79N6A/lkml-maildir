No, that was raid5 only.
Now I tried to test as much of the configuration that did not work for
me. The current testsystem is a bit different from the original though,
as that was with Maxtor Pro 500 disks, and the current one Maxtor
MaxLine10 disks. Also the kernel was 2.6.16-rc3, and now is 2.6.16-rc6.
I do:
mdadm -C -l5 -n8 /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 \
/dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdh1
mke2fs -j -m1 /dev/md0
mount -o data=writeback /dev/md0 /mnt
for i in `seq 10`
do dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile.$i bs=1024k count=10000
done
md5sum bigfile.*
rm bigfile.*
With plain 2.6.16-rc6 the system crashes during one of the md5sums, most
of the time the first or the second file. I've lost the last line on
netconsole, but will reproduce with 2.6.16.
With 2.6.16-rc6 and your sata_mv patch the system also crashes during
one of the md5sums, most of the time the first or the second file. There
is no output on netconsole.
2.6.16-rc6-mm2 seems to work, which I did not expect..
