I'm having trouble with ide-scsi emulation on Alpha 164SX. I'm using
kernel 2.2.5 with 2.2.5-uniform-ide-patch-6.19, -ac7 and down_try_lock
patches (applied in that order).
Things seem OK when I insert the module ide-scsi.o . However, if I try to
mount a device (/dev/scd0 for example), the machine reboots immediately,
jumps to MILO and hangs there.
I have no real SCSI disks or adapters. I don't know exactly what is to
blame but thought, someone else ought to know.
