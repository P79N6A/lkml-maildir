Hrm, got dropped from the Cc... :) Yes, the dynamic-tick generic
infrastructure being proposed, with the idle CPU mask and the
set_all_cpus_idle() tick_source hook, would allow exactly this in
arch-specific code.
Is there a generic location where the all-idle state is entered?
Currently, I think we can do it via the generic reprogram() routine
checking the mask and then calling set_all_cpus_idle(), if
appropriate, after reprogramming the last idle CPU.
Thanks,
Nish
