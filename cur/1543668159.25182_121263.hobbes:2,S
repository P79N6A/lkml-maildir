  i just downloaded the bk4 set of patches for 2.5.66 to see if
anything has changed with respect to the weird keyboard problems
i was having with my dell laptop and its external PS/2 keyboard.
  has anyone else been seeing this?  do any of the patches
in the bk4 snapshot address this?  i'm recompiling as we speak,
and i'll test it again as soon as i can.
