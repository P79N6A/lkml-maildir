Yes, that's a known bug, but the complete bug list of the tlb flush code
is a bit longer :-(
* parameters swapped.
* current->active_mm can be NULL during thread switch.
* current->mm->cpu_vm_mask is not updated properly during thread switch
if a flush IPI arrives between switch_mm() and switch_to().
The first 2 problems are fixed in Ingo's newest patch, and the third
problem is fixed in my patch that I posted yesterday [and forwarded to
Linus for inclusion in the next kernel]
