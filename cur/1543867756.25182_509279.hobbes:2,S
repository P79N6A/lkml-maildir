The led framework is generic. If you can write a function to turn it
on/off you can drive it with the LED framework.

This has been discussed in several places several times. The problem
with hardware accelerated flashing is that you're are often limited to
certain constraints (this case being no exception) and indicating what
these are to userspace in a generic fashion is difficult.
One way I've come up with is adds capability to the class to have LED
specific triggers and you can then expose these hardware capabilities as
an extra trigger specific to the LED.
Another proposal more specific to this use case was to have some
information behind the scenes which the software timer based trigger
could use to turn on the "hardware acceleration" if present and capable
of the requested mode. This might just need a function pointer in the
core so could be quite neat.
Nether patch exists yet.
Cheers,
Richard
