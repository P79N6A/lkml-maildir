Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] show MCP menu only on ARCH_SA1100
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On architectures like i386, the "Multimedia Capabilities Port drivers" 
menu is visible, but it can't be visited since it contains nothing 
usable for !ARCH_SA1100.
This patch therefore shows this menu only on ARCH_SA1100.
