The kernel isn't going to do this.  It's a user space issue.

You don't know udev then :)
This is exactly what udev solves.  Please read the paper I posted a link
to, it should answer your questions.

If you can't rely on scsi position, then you need to look for something
that uniquely describes the device.  Like a filesystem label, or a uuid
on the device.  udev can handle this (well I'm still working on the
filesystem label, but others have already done the hard work for that to
be intregrated easily.)
