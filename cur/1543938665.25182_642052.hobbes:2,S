Subject: vmalloc_32 and SLAB incompatible in 2.6.23.9

     Since GFP_DMA32 is not considered a valid flag, vmalloc_32 and
  SLAB are incompatible in kernel 2.6.23.9 (and probably later ones).
  It might be as simple as adding GFP_DMA32 everywhere where
  GFP_DMA is used in mm/slab.c, but I don't dare do it. I personally
  switched to SLUB.
      Thanks,
