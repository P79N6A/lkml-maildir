Release 1.9.8: Thu Dec 13 03:52:38 EST 2001
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.17-pre8/2.5.1-pre11.
	* Saveability predicate simplified drastically.
This is a point release intended for Keith Owens to test.  He has
reported a bug that different front ends save out different sets of symbols
set to n; all the variants are logically equivalent, so this is strictly
speaking only a cosmetic bug.  This release attempts to fix the problem by
simplifying the code that determines whether a symbol is eligible to be 
saved out.
