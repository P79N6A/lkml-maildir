I can't get my mail client to send in ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, so the 
actual patch is attached in octet-stream format. The below patch is just 
for reference and will almost certainly NOT work.
Also, since the patch includes both encodings, whichever encoding you 
select while viewing it will display one correct and one garbled line. 
However, the bytecodes -are- correct.
