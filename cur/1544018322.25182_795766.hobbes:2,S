Subject: 2.6.28 headers break kbd and net-tools userspace builds

Breaks kbd like this:
  /usr/include/linux/serial.h:164: error: expected 
specifier-qualifier-list before '__u32'
and net-tools like this:
  In file included from /usr/include/linux/if_tunnel.h:5,
                   from iptunnel.c:39:
  /usr/include/linux/ip.h:85: error: redefinition of 'struct iphdr'
Both build fine with 2.6.27.10 headers.
Hope that's useful.
