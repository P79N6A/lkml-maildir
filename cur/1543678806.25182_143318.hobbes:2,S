says that for 'NET' events, 'register' and 'unregister' are the actions.
Starting ppp, I get this:
Jun 25 10:50:22 turing-police /etc/hotplug/net.agent: NET add event not supported
'NET add'?? WTF? ;)
(Fortunately, '/sbin/ifup ppp0' gets invoked anyhow, so it's not THAT crucial)
/Valdis (who still needs to fix hotplug not being called at all for the wireless card)
