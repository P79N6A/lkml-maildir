Subject: [PATCH] remove spurious timer interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Since I turned on the IO-APICs on secondary quads in 2.4.19-pre2, we
are receiving timer interrupts on *all* quads, not just the first quad, each
from their local timer chip. This causes time to progress far too rapidly ;-)
The simple patch below turns off the timer interrupts for IO-APICs other
than interrupt 0, and has been tested to fix the problem. As it switches
on clustered_apic_mode, it should be safe from hurting anyone else.
Please apply ...
Thanks,
Martin
