alloc_pages_node() does not guarantee allocation on a specific node, but
calling __alloc_pages() with a specific nodelist would.

My goal was to not change the behavior of the slab allocator when inserting
a mempool-backed allocator "under" it.  Without support for at least
*requesting* allocations from a specific node when allocating from a
mempool, this would change how the slab allocator works.  That would be
bad.  The slab allocator now does not guarantee that, for example, a
kmalloc_node() request is satisfied by memory from the requested node, but
it does at least TRY.  Without adding mempool_alloc_node() then I would
never be able to even TRY to satisfy a mempool-backed kmalloc_node()
request from the correct node.  I believe that would constitute an
unacceptable breakage from normal, documented behavior.  So, I *do* need
this patch.
