I presume this:
	#define set_pte(pteptr, pteval) \
	do {                                                    \
		*(pteptr) = (pteval);                           \
		asm volatile("dcf %M0" :: "U"(*pteptr));        \
	} while(0)
	void jump(unsigned long *ppte, unsigned long pte)
	{
		set_pte(ppte, pte);
	}
Shows the problem.
I was in the process of checking that all the FRV constraint stuff got
upstream, but was stalled by an ICE whilst building the gcc-4.2.  This logged
as gcc bug #28583 and not as yet fixed.
However, I've run the above test program with the xgcc intermediate compiler
built during the compilation of gcc, and that shows the problem you're
reporting.  I'll chase it up.
Meanwhile, if you want to use a working, though older gcc, you can find one in:
