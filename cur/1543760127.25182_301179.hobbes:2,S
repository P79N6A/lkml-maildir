  Hmm. I see for example a place at jbd/commit.c, line 287 (which you
did not change in your patch) which does this and doesn't seem to be
protected against journal_unmap_buffer() (but maybe I miss something).
Not that I'd find that race probable but in theory...

  I agree that only the metadata/data updates can race with checkpoint/commit
because other combinations are already serialized by 'higher-level'
locks. But I think we agree that the simplier (and 'local') the locking rules
are the less probable the bugs are..
