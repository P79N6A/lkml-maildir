We need about 100-200 Hz. That will be quite enough.
And we are doing a long-term analysis (the samples will be averaged over a
couple seconds) so there is no problem in losing a couple samples.

That's right.. I would have used a proper sound card but our subject is
"Sound recording and analysis in hardware" and the PC was originally
supposed to be only for displaying the samples. (Now we use it to display
average values as well, but that's another issue.)

I would be glad if there was. Otherwise we would have to do it in DOS and I
have no initiative to start fiddling with interrupts and IO adresses.
