This is not a question of what's better or not. 
Michal stepped into a real life problem:
1. ramdisk gets created in the first place w/o problems
2. formatting the same ramdisk succeeds
3. trying to use it fails
So either #1 or #2 should have failed in the first place. Failing in #3
is definitely a BUG in #1 or #2.
How does your advise help to fix that BUG ? Ignoring it by using
something else ?
