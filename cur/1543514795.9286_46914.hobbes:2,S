  Hi, all. Version 133 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this patch removes more compatibility entries. If you need the
compatibility entries, install devfsd-v1.2.8 which will create them
automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Created <devfs_get_unregister_slave>
- Fixed bug in fs/partitions/check.c when rescanning
				Regards,
					Richard....
