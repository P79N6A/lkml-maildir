Right. The per-thread RSS seems to have made a big difference for high CPU
counts. Also I was conservative in the estimates in earlier post since I
did not have the numbers for the very high cpu counts.

I can try that but I am frankly a bit sceptical since the ptl protects
many other variables. It may be more efficient to have the ptl in these
cases than doing the atomic ops all over the place. Do you have any number
you could post? I believe I send you a copy of the code that I use for
performance tests last week or so,

Is the patch known to be okay for ia64? I can try to see how it
does.

I'd certainly be willing to poke around and see how beneficial this is. If
it turns out to accellerate other functionality of the vm then you
have my full support.
