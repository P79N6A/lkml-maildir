This brings up an very interesting (but painful) question...which makes more
sense? Allowing the modifications in only the top-most branch, or any branch
(given the user allows it at mount-time)?
This is really question to the community at large, not just you, Dave :)

Right. Doing something like this at the filesystem level (as we do in
unionfs) seems less painful - filesystems are places full of all sorts of
nefarious activities to begin with. Having it in the VFS seems...even
uglier.
