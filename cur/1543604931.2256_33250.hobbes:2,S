I am very sure that this oops is related to mppp. There seems to be a
bug in the mppp-code which produces exactly this output (the lines with
-1 at the end and then a oops during sceduling). I asked at the
isdn4linux-devel-list but the mppp-code seems to be so dirty that they
think it would be easyer to rewrite it than debugging it. So I think
there will be no fast solution for this problem.
