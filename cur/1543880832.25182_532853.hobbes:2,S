You mean the VMware one doesn't work? I tried it and got:
(gdb) target remote localhost:8832 
Remote debugging using localhost:8832 
Ignoring packet error, continuing... 
warning: unrecognized item "timeout" in "qSupported" respoonse 
Ignoring packet error, continuing... 
Ignoring packet error, continuing... 
Ignoring packet error, continuing... 
Malformed response to offset query, timeout 
(gdb)
Hopefully that's not too hard to fix. Made the appropriate noises :)
