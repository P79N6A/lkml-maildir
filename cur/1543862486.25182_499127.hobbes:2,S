No, it's not. What is broken are our header dependencies - we happily mix 
declarations with implementations.
Let's take a simple example like <linux/list.h>, which is practically 
included everywhere, but even that already includes 57 other files and 
depends on 49 config symbols (by comparison for <linux/types.h> it's 7 
other files and 7 symbols).

That's exactly want I want to avoid, thread info and task struct can be 
accessed via a single register (pointer).

That still generates worse code, the best solution would be to leave the 
work to gcc, but that requires it can actually recognize that task struct 
and thread info need only a single pointer.
One possibility would be to do something like ia64 and abuse 
asm-offsets.h, but then one gets other funny build problems.
By far the cleanest solution would be to clean up our damned header 
dependencies, separating task_struct from sched.h is not that difficult 
and would give archs far more flexibility how to place task struct and 
thread info.
