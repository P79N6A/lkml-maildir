My contention is that if some process (not in the same thread group as the
process that originally set up the directory notifier) tries to set up a
directory notifier on the same file descriptor (i.e. they are a child of
the original process), then they should get their own notifier.  The
parent can remove their notifier if they want to.
Notice that multiple processes can have notifiers enabled for the same
directory (even with a different set of flags).
My patch makes directory notifiers per thread group instead of per process
tree (which they are now).

This would be equivalent to returning -EPERM if you tried to remove a
lock on a file when you didn't set it ...
