Is this good or bad? I'm guessing it means it's still leaking. So it's
really starting to look like ata_piix is the problem. But we need someone
who has the leak to remove that and see if it helps. I can't, since my
drives are connected to it.
And developers:
Can anyone PLEASE take a look at this? We've got 4 confirmed reports of
it, and it's nothing to do with a tainted module. Take a look at this
slabtop output:
    OBJS ACTIVE  USE OBJ SIZE  SLABS OBJ/SLAB CACHE SIZE NAME
1230120 1230120 100%   0.38K 123012      10    492048K scsi_cmd_cache
I have a 492MB leak! And notice how objects never become unused - that
looks like the problem.
