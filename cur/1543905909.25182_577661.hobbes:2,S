Hmm.. Oddness. Looks empty:
# cat /sys/devices/pnp0/00\:0f/options | wc
      0       0       0
Or is that expected if the chipset has one cast-in-stone/ROM config?

Patch tested, and seems to decide to initialize in polled mode on my
machine, without having to do any /etc/modprobe.conf 'interrupts=0'.
I'm able to run the tpm_demo program from libtpm-2.0, so /dev/tpm0 does
seem to be operational.
You can stick this on the patch and pass it along:
Tested-By: <valdis.kletnieks@vt.edu>
but I'd suggest running a regression test against a chipset that *does*
do IRQs before sending it upstream (if you haven't already)...
