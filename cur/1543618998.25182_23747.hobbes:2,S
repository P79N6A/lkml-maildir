With 98, "ping localhost" on "guest" os showed 2 responses, then pause for
few seconds, then response, ...
With 95, I got the 1st response, then nothing. 98 seems better, but still
slow...
With 100, it's perfect.

No difference, still slow. Even with guest os running pre6, it's still
slow.

guest os "ping localhost" is perfect.

Ok got it. But still have to reboot machine as the apm is loaded and can't
"rmmod apm". Complained that it's in use ([kapmd] even after stopping
apmd.
By the way, setting power_off=1 or realmode_power_off=1 does not power off
the h/w.
Thanks,
Jeff.
