Obviously, ps prints a *really* *long* title.
I suppose, given enough tasks and ps options that
cause sorting, you could run ps out of memory.

You won't see this in ps output. To save memory
and avoid reading normally-redundant info, ps will
only read the cmdline data once for a process.
You can get the thread ID with "ps -efL", "ps -efT",
"ps -efLm", and so on. That's pretty good. Have it all:
ps -emostat,c,psr,rtprio,class,ppid,pid,tid,nlwp,wchan:9,args

Now, this I like.
Solaris stores the first 80 bytes of argv in the
kernel. Modifications do not show up. HP-UX stores
the first 64 bytes, and in recent releases can
also supply a kilobyte of (modified?) argv.
