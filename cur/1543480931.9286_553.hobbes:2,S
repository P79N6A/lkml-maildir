I am thinking about a registration facility
    system_call_register( ... )
    system_call_unregister( ... )
    /proc/system_call_list
    ioctl_register( ... )
    ioctl_unregister( .... )
    /proc/ioctl_list
Then strace and mec-trace could read the lists via the /proc files
and would not need their own tables that go out of date all the time.
