We aren't sending that to the existing cards - they are still in
whatever state they were when they were previously detected.  In
addition, we aren't actually changing or detecting the operational
conditions, we're merely informing the new cards about the existing
setup.

Yes - any cards not already in idle state will ignore the command
as intended.
