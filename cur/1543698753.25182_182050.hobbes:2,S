what you're complaining is the 'selection of the task to be killed'.
That's not solvable. the kernel can't read your brain period. Only if
the kernel could read the brain of the adminstrator then you would be
happy, there is no way the kernel can know which is the task you really
want to have killed first.

The kernel can't know what is a pain for you and what is pain for other
people.
Measuring the page fault rate seems to get the closest heuristic that
may not be a pain for most people, all current oom killers are a pain
for somebody, desktop users where pretty much fine with 2.4.22, server
users had pain with 2.4.22 and should have less pain with 2.4.23. There
is no way to make everybody happy in 2.4.
> Rick's old vm worked better. It'd have killed the task that had last allocated memory.
it was the biggest one that's why. the old omm killer gets your desktop
scenario always correctly, true, (as far as your biggest task doesn't
get stuck on nfs etc..)

I'm aware about those issues, that's a feature not a bug.
