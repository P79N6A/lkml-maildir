Hmm.  Right off the bat, I see a terminology problem.
The man page says
.SH NAME
epoll \- edge triggered asynchronous I/O facility
That's going to confuse some users.  They might think
epoll can actually initiate I/O.  Better to say
epoll \- edge triggered I/O readiness notification facility
Second, epoll_ctl(2) doesn't define the meaning of the
event mask.  It should give the allowed bits and define
their meanings.  If we use the traditional POLLIN etc, we
can say
   POLLIN - the fd has become ready for reading
   POLLOUT - the fd has become ready for writing
   Note: If epoll tells you e.g. POLLIN, it means that
            poll will tell you the same thing,
            since poll gives the current status,
            and epoll gives changes in status.
