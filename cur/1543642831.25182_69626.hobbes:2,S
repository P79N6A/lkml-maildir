It depends. The block layer might need knowledge of the different paths for
load balancing.

I disagree. What makes "generic" implementations difficult is the absolutely
mediocre error reporting and handling from the lower layers.
With multipathing, you want the lower level to hand you the error
_immediately_ if there is some way it could be related to a path failure and
no automatic retries should take place - so you can immediately mark the path
as faulty and go to another. 
However, on a "access beyond end of device" or a clear read error, failing a
path is a rather stupid idea, but instead the error should go up immediately.
This will need to be sorted regardless of the layer it is implemented in.
How far has this been already addressed in 2.5 ?

For user-space reprobing of failed paths, it may be vital to expose the
physical paths too. Then "reprobing" could be as simple as
	dd if=/dev/physical/path of=/dev/null count=1 && enable_path_again
I dislike reprobing in kernel space, in particular using live requests as
the LVM1 patch by IBM does it.
