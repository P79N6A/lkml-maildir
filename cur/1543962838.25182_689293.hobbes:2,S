Hello again!
I tried 2.6.26-rc1 and only these two warnings are left:
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x10fe7): Section mismatch in reference from
the function cpu_exit_clear() to the function
.cpuinit.text:cpu_uninit()
The function cpu_exit_clear() references
the function __cpuinit cpu_uninit().
This is often because cpu_exit_clear lacks a __cpuinit
annotation or the annotation of cpu_uninit is wrong.
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x1e26e4): Section mismatch in reference from
the function pci_scan_bus_on_node() to the function
.devinit.text:pci_scan_bus_parented()
The function pci_scan_bus_on_node() references
the function __devinit pci_scan_bus_parented().
This is often because pci_scan_bus_on_node lacks a __devinit
annotation or the annotation of pci_scan_bus_parented is wrong.
