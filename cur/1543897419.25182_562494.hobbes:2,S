I have a motherboard with an intel chipset and onboard audio.  I have a
problem with alsa.  There's no pcm* files in /proc/asound/card0.
I tried quake on it which didn't work.  I remembered the problem with oss
use on alsa and tried to do the echo "..." as stated in the kernel docs only
to find out the path doesn't exist.  Here's what I see:

This is a BCM IN845GV board.
What is interesting is the same driver (kernel 2.6.20) and the same pciid
(except for subsystem) works fine on another machine.

This is a Supermicro X5DA8 board (This one works fine!).
I don't know what to do with the BCM board other than just use OSS drivers
which work just fine on this board.
