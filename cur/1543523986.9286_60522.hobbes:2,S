Hello All,
    I have working with VxWorks lately, and it has a feature that I would
like to be able to emulate under Linux.  VxWorks will let you create a task
in a suspended state.  You can then attach gdb to this suspended task, and
typing cont at the gdb prompt will allow it to run.  Does anybody know of
a way to do this under Linux?
Thanks,
Jim
