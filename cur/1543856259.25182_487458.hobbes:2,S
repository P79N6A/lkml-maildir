Providing object files for on-demand relinking of the kernel just adds a
shit load of overhead. If you're suggesting modifying vmlinuz in place
instead, that just seems really undesirable. Last thing I want is
something mucking with the kernel binary.
It's easier for me to keep this patch in my tree, especially since most
users have come to expect this as the "standard" method for inserting
their DSDT replacement.
The only other thing I can think of is grub providing the DSDT just like
it does for the initrd.
