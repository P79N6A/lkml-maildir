Your checker doesn't quite test for nested includes.  E.g. if foo.h
includes bar.h, and bar.h includes config.h, then foo.h doesn't need to
include config.h explicitly.
For a more concrete example, take include/asm-i386/kprobes.h from your
list.  That includes linux/types.h, which includes linux/config.h.
Making a tool that takes that into account could be interesting.
