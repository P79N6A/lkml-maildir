I would like to add that perhaps using tmpfs instead of ramfs would be
a nice touch. As the initial ramfs would get overmounted instead of
unmounted, this allows the contents of the initial fs to get swapped
out instead of either taking up memory indefinitely.
Also isn't tmpfs already compiled into the kernel by default to support
shared memory and such?
