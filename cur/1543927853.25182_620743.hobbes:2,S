Yes, I believe that - otherwise, this problem would have
been a crisis a LONG time ago...:-)
But I do have some more questions in relationship to how 
things are mapped in your environment. I have a flat memory 
map (i.e.: the full 0x0 -- 0x1_0000_0000 is passed to the 32bit 
Linux kernel without any 'holes' and/or reserved areas).
 
Does your Intel memory map have this same type of flat memory 
model (and thus allow use of the FULL lower 4Gig) - or does it 
reserve areas of lower 4Gig for devices and such - if not - where 
are these reserved areas - and how do the relate to the I/O memory
map for the device?
 
In other words, I would be very interested in seeing the memory 
map & the PCI memory mapping to see if any overlap/correspond 
to reserve areas of lower 4 Gig (in a linux 32bit mode)...

Yeah, I kind of had your reports in mind when I asked that.  :)
On a related note, I now have lots of Marvell (sata_mv) hardware here,
and an Intel CPU/chipset box with physical RAM above the 4GB boundary.
Cheers
