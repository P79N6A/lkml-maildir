Well, hopefully the lost tick detection code won't over compensate, so
it shouldn't be an issue. However, as Tim Mann pointed out it, due to
interrupt delay and queuing, it is seen on virtualized systems.
See 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.2/2293.html
 for
his explanation.

Ideally (in my mind), we need to first get a stable and reliable time
base that isn't affected by lost interrupts. This is what I've been
(unfortunately not very frequently) working on w/ my time of day re-work
(See 
http://lwn.net/Articles/100665/
 - although this is somewhat out of
date as I've been re-working some bits and need to post a new set of
patches soon). 
Once that is done, we can convert the timer subsystem to use units of
nanoseconds, rather then jiffies for its time accounting. Interrupt
delay, loss, and queuing then become a latency issue, rather then a
correctness one.
However, patches speak louder then words (and I need to do less talking
and more coding), so don't let me keep you from implementing your own
solution.
