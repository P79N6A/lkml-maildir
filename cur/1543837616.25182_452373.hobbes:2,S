Andrew, thanks for taking a close look this series of changes.
I agree with you that the timing is right, to do the clean up now rather 
than later. I would give it a try. If I could get more help from more 
code reviewer, it probably makes the effort a lot easier. For those 
issues you pointed out : coding style problem，incorrect comments, 
poorly-named variables  -- do you have any specific examples in your mind?

So probably the right thing to do is keep the ext4 patches against mm 
tree instead of rc three?

Okay, I will look at it.
Thanks,
