Hello,
I have been told that dm_snapshot is still experimental in the 2.6.10
kernel, and I was advised not to have more than one snapshot created
at a time for the same logical volume.
Basically I am just wondering what the potential problems are with
dm_snapshot.  Is there anything particular that I should look out for?
Thanks for any advice,
Kristina
