Hello.
I'm trying to find where in the kernel is made the reverse path
validation. I have found the sysctl code that controls loading of value
into kernel variable, but I cannot find where this variable is used to do
the actual packet validation. Can anyone show me the pathname of source
file in which this validation is made ?
Thanks in advance
