By using the kernel's existing access control -- not trying to roll
your own access control at the user level.  This is a standard recommendation
in the security world, and it is good advice.
For instance, in this case, this advice might mean that you just call
execve() and check whether it succeeded or failed, and let the kernel
do the access control check on whether the exec is permitted.  That tends
to be more fool-proof (or at least fool-resistant) than the alternatives.

Perhaps.  But it seems to me that there would need to be a persuasive
argument before it makes sense to violate the general advice listed above.
