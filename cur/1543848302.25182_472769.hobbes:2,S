The power supplies in both machines on which I'm seeing the problem are brand 
new, supposedly good quality and from different manufacturers. Could it be 
that the motherboard has some fault which causes it to overload even good 
power supplies?

The motherboard has all the usual heat sensors and will alarm if something 
gets too hot - I suspected overheating the first time this happened and 
checked the temps in the BIOS, but everything was well within limits.

The cpuinfo does indeed match the reported BIOS speed. The boards are already 
running the latest BIOS, so if it is a BIOS issue the motherboard 
manufacturer isn't aware of it...

I should have mentioned that of the two machines that are having the problem, 
one is using IDE and the other SATA. The SATA machine seems worst affected by 
it.

OK I'll give all that a go.
Thanks for your help,
David.
