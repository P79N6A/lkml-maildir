To Siddarth and others.
How can this remotely be related to linux-kernel ? Have you ever tried
the "man mmap" or reading the recommended books. If you didn't installed
the manual pages then reinstall your system and take a programming
course. A linux kernel discussion list is not a programming course.
Lets try to change the noise ratio a bit.
ONLY ask questions to the linux-kernel group if its related to the
linux kernel. I can not be that difficult.
No questions like "aehmmmm, I'm working on my thesis about life
universe and everything and I wonder how Linux can help me solve
the eternal relation problem between income and expenses ?"
