Guilt v0.17 is available for download.
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Overall, a lot of good changes that make the whole porcelain more robust.
The most notable one is the format of the status file (lists pushed patches)
which now also includes the hash of the commit object associated with the
patch.
Go ahead, use it, abuse it, and send patches ;)
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.

      Fixed guilt-{delete,pop} regexps some more
      Force UTC as timezone for regression tests
      Fixed a bug in guilt-pop introduced by the status file format switch

      Yet another TODO update
      Added guilt-rm
      Makefile update & cleanup
