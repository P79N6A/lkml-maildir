What you're seeing isn't normal.
I suspect synchronising the client and server clocks would fix your problem.
I've used Linux NFS client for years and it's done very good cacheing.
In the 6 months or so I can confirm it definitely does very nice
cacheing, with the default mount options.
(This to Solaris NFS server -- though it should be just as good even to
user space Linux server).
It's the attribute cache that should be refreshing every few seconds.
Data remains cached as long as the attributes keep agreeing.
I.e. forever if it doesn't change.

I don't know about NFSv3.  But NFSv2 which I've used doesn't have
invalidate messages.
If you're going to edit a file (e.g. a mail folder), open() revalidates
the cache while close() flushes pending writes.  If you do an fcntl()
lock as well and the server doesn't have a broken lockd daemon,
everything is nicely serialised.
The fine details got tidied up towards the end of the 2.1.x kernels.
