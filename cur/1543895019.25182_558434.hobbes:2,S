Yes, but C syntax (and grammar) is limited set. And alignmet I'm talking
about may cover the following statements only:
1) Mathematical
2) Logical
3) Function's arguments
Btw, if I see header with definition like
	int foo(int);
instead of
	int foo(int arg);
it makes me nerve ;)
Of course that all concerned to statements being splitted to several lines.
And I think CodingStyle would have recommendations about it. But maybe
I'm just a moron ;)
