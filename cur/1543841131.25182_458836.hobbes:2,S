FYI, I couldn't fix the locking dependency issues without modifying
the radix-tree implementation since even if you preload the tree
outside the memleak lock, it still tries to allocate memory in
radix_tree_insert.
I'll instead use a hash table (together with hlist) where I can
control the memory allocations and make more use of RCU. In my few
initial tests, the memory search with hash tables is about the same
speed (if not slightly faster) as the radix-tree implementation.
I will post a new kmemleak version by the end of this week.
