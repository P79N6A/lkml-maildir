Yes. I advocate embedding markup tags in a comment block for each
function, which can then be automatically extracted to generate man
pages. This keeps the API documentation right there in the source
code, which vastly increases the chances that an update will be
reflected in the documentation.
If you look at my devfs patch, you can see what it looks like
(fs/devfs/base.c). Also look at smp_call_function() in
arch/i386/kernel/smp.c for an example.
I've got code which extracts this and allows you to generate man pages
and HTML (complete with cross-referencing/hyperlinks). I've been using
this scheme for years now. It works really well.
It's a lot of work to go through code and add all those markups, but
it's worth the effort in the long run. Once you're set up and in a
routine, you never have to worry about API documentation again.
