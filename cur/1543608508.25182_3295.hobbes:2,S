You didn't read the output then.  The information about which disks are up
and which are failed, is put between square brackets too.  You don't want
to ignore that.
So just ignore square brackets that have "=" " " and ">" between them ?
What happens when someone decides  "[---->   ]" looks cooler ?
Or just parse the brackets with "U" "F" and "_" between them ?  What then
when someone decides that disks being resynced are marked with "R"  ?
Fuzzy matching.
Nightmare.
