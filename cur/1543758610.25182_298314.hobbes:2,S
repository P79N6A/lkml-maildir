Dear Friend,
My names are Rose Okot Opoka. Im an 18 year old Ugandan girl living in the northern part. Our village was raided in November 2002 by the rebel group the lords resistance army . My father was a very wealthy International Coffee merchant and on that day, he was brutally beaten and tortured because he refused to sponsor the rebels with their evil intents. He was later killed.
 My mother and I were abducted. We were both raped and after they raped my mother, they shot one of her legs so that she could not run away and she could be forced to give them part of my fathers money. I was very young so they didnt think I could escape. At 15 I was made a sex slave to 5 of the commanders. My mother was aware that she might have little time to live, so she told me what my inheritance was. My father left me a sum of 4 million US Dollars which I can only claim at reaching the age of 18. She asked me to find a way to escape from the mean soldiers. She gave me directions to where I could find the documents and whom I can contact since I was almost turning 18. I set my plans in motion. A month later, my mother was driven and dropped to an unknown place since she was not ready to give the Soldiers part of our lifes hard earned money. 
To cut the long story short, I managed to escape in July 2004. I found all the contacts that I was given.
Since I turned 18 on 31 January 2005, I can now claim that money. So that it can help me look for my missing mother, hopefully shes still alive and also continue my education.
Considering the fact that I am not exposed to the world market and investment,  I am seeking your assistance to help me claim the money because its in a foreign account in Europe. I would like you to help me transfer it from where it is now, to your account.
Im willing to offer you 15% of the money for your efforts and inputs. I would also appreciate it if you can act as my guardian. I will send you all the necessary detail and required documents as regards to the transaction, upon receipt of your response.
Thank you very much for your anticipated cooperation. Hope to hear from you soon. 
Sincerely Yours
Rose Okot Opoka
