Only if you close them before. The process may have been started with
arbitrary fds open.

Which you cannot anyway. Already some library routines can open fds
although they don't explicitly say so and don't have to in all
implementations, like openlog() or all the get*by*() stuff (or even
dlopen()), so you are never sure to know which or how many FDs you
actually have open.
