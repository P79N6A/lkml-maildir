> [PATCH] bluetooth: fix locking in hci_sock_dev_event()
> 
> We presently use lock_sock() to acquire a lock on a socket in
> hci_sock_dev_event(), but this goes BUG because lock_sock()
> can sleep and we're already holding a read-write spinlock at
> that point. So, we must use the non-sleeping BH version,
> bh_lock_sock().
> 
> However, hci_sock_dev_event() is called from user context and
> hence using simply bh_lock_sock() will deadlock against a
> concurrent softirq that tries to acquire a lock on the same
> socket. Hence, disabling BH's before acquiring the socket lock
> and enable them afterwards, is the proper solution to fix
> socket locking in hci_sock_dev_event().
