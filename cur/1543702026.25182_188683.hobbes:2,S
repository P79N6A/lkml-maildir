Hi All,
I am having some PCI resource allocation problem in RH
Enterprise Linux 3.0 (linux-2.4.21-4.EL kernel).
Its seems the kernel is not allocating  PCI resource
for our PCI card during kernel init. This  PCI
resource allocation problem has been occurred only in
RHEL 3.0 kernel.
When I am testing our card in RH 9.0 (2.4-20) kernel,
I can see all PCI resource regions like memio and
ioport regions are allocated properly. (I am using
/proc/iomem and /proc/ioport for this). So I 
am suspecting  RHEL 3.0 kernel is not populating the
PCI resources properly during kernel initialization. 
Am I missing some thing in kernel configuration while
kernel image building. 
Any help regarding this will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Sundar
