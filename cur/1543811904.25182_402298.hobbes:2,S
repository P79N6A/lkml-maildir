Drat - off by one in my reporting again.  The first "good" (1) case
was one patch earlier than reported above.
cpufreq-_ppc-frequency-change-issues-freq-already-lowered-by-bios.patch - good
gregkh-driver-put_device-might_sleep.patch                              - untested
gregkh-driver-empty_release_functions_are_broken.patch                  - special case
gregkh-driver-allow-sysfs-attribute-files-to-be-pollable.patch          - bad
