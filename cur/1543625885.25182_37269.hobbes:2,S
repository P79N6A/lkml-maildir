Doesn't seem confusing at all.
RETURN VALUE
       On  success  readv  returns  the number of bytes read.  On
       success writev returns the number of  bytes  written.   On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
ERRORS
       EINVAL An  invalid  argument was given. For instance count
             might be greater than MAX_IOVEC, or zero.  fd could
              also  be  attached to an object  which  is  unsuit-
              able  for  reading  (for  readv)  or  writing  (for
              writev).
I don't see much in the way of waffle words. If count is greater than
MAX_IOVEC or zero you get EINVAL. I suppose your next argument is if
count exceeds MAX_IOVEC a return of 0 is okay since, hopefully, nothing
was read? Where do you read a non-error return of zero is acceptable
for count of 0? I states EINVAL for a count of 0.
If your going to rework the manpage, then drop a count of 0 as an error,
otherwise fix the kernel with the trival patch.
