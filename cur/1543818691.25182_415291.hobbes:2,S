Weird, things started working for me around 2.6.9 without having to 
modify any sysctl stuff.

I was wrong in my previous mail where I said that the rmem/wmem output 
hasn't changed over the two kernels - it has, the 3rd column differs. I 
simply set those values back to what they were on 2.6.16 and now things 
work again - I presumably have window scale 2 (scale factor 4) again, 
which appears to be a decent compromise between having a window and 
things actually working.
For anyone else interested, the ISP is NTL (UK). The fix:
	echo "4096    16384   131072 " > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
	echo "4096    87380   174760 " > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
This issue is visible on my 1GB system but not on my laptop (256mb RAM). 
The key thing is that more memory means a higher window scale factor is 
used, which appears to trigger ntl's brokenness.
