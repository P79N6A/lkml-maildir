Yes, of course, unfortunately this speeds up the CPU up to max power consumption
which isn't wanted at least at a notebook b/c temperature and fan speed are at
maximum in that case :-(
It would be nice to run a grid application at lowest priority without impact to
power / fan / temperature but OTOH have full performance for desktop
applications, isn't it ?
