I think that's perfectly true, sadly. It may even become the subject of the
phrack article, next to the collection of insmod_without_module_support, etc...
The only useful feature it would provide would be to secure a system against
people who tamper on the media itself, which is fairly trivial on nfsroot. It
may be interesting to ensure that a server farm which all mount their root from
a central server may not be tricked into executing undesired code injected into
the central NFS server.
The same would be true for removable media such as smartmedia, on PDAs or
specialized systems.
Just a few thoughts,
Willy
