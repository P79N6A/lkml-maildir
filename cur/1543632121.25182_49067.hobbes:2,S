Subject: 2.5.19: tdfxfb broken

I'm using the framebuffer on a 3dfx V3-3000 using the tdfxfb driver and
the following setup:
  append = "3 video=tdfx:1280x1024-8,nomtrr,font:SUN12x22"
This worked well for all 2.4.* kernels and all working 2.5.* kernels
so far. It doesn't work with 2.5.19. The screen remains all black
without any text being shown. Just the logo is shown in its original size
at the right position, but in wrong colors (e.g. the normally black
background around Tux is blue).
