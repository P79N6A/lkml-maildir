I also.  The bug database tries to convert the traditional many<->many
debugging process into a one<->one process.  This surely results in a
lower cleanup rate.
It's irritating replying to a bugzilla entry when you _know_ that you're
cutting other interested parties out of the loop.
And mailing lists tend to be self-correcting:
- The once-off bugs due to broken hardware get filtered away.
- The bugs which simply get magically fixed when someone repaired some
  unrelated part of the kernel get filtered out.
- The bugs which are affecting people the most get reported the most.
- Lots of other people can chip in with potentially useful info.
It is nice to have a record.  But bugzilla is not a comfortable or
productive environment within which to drill down into and fix problems.
