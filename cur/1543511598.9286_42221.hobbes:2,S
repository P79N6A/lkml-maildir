Has anyone thought to check to see where this 'pts' lies?  I've found out
that one of the dev_t elements of stat show the device these were mounted
from (I wrote a program to show this info as well, there is also on in
debian that does something similar).  Obviously, if the major/minor of pts
is != to the major/minor of . (where pts is), then it's mounted.
Anyone disagree?
