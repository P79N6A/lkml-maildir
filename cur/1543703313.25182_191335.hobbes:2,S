Ah, that explains why it's expecting to find the new resource covering
the old one.

Well, I'm not sure there's a need for it.  It seems to me that all
insert_resource is supposed to be doing is saying "I've got this
resource here that should have been placed into the tree...please do it
now".
The ia64 I forgot this bridge, and the Alder IO-APIC this PCI BAR is
actually the IO-APIC and thus part of the reserved BIOS area look to be
similar aspects of the same problem.
The only difference (which is what I needed the patch for) was that the
Alder resource needs to go underneath the bios reserved area.
How are you proposing that IORESOURCE_TENTATIVE should work?
