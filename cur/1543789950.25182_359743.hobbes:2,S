Does this patch is only for Blackfin processor or it add some support for fusiv 
[1] communications processor that are in residential Gateway ?
If no, do you know if analog plans to realease the linux 2.4/2.6 modification
that have been made in order to support these processors ?
IRRC some Sagem residential Gateways[2] (will) run on 
Linux OS and the users sould be able ask for the GPL code.
