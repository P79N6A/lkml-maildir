But these mounts _are_ special.  There is really no point in moving or
pivoting them.

In that case they are cloned, but only those survive which have refs
in the new namespace.

These mounts are not propagated.  Or at least I hope so.  Propagation
stuff is a bit too complicated for my poor little brain.

I think they should be the same superblock, same dentry.  What would
be the advantage of doing otherwise?

I think doing this recursively should be allowed.  "Releasing last ref
cleans up the mess" should work in that case.

Agreed :)
