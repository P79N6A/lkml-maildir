Scarcely. The task can't be done in realtime. The data will be stale
by the time it's reported anyway. Limiting the amount of sampling done
is vastly superior to beating the kernel's reporting interfaces to
death in a totally futile attempt to achieve infeasible consistencies,
burning ridiculous amounts of cpu in the process, and reporting
gibberish in the end anyway.

No, hard cpu limits are required, and even then it just spews gibberish
and very slowly. The current algorithms are nonfunctional with any
substantial number of processes.

Refusal to rate limit sampling doesn't make the data more coherent in
the presence of large numbers of tasks.

No, that's not general satisfiability. Each field to be reported needs
at least one out of some set of subsets of /proc/ files associated with
a process to be includes in those parsed. Checking for inclusion of one
of a field's required subsets for each field suffices. The number of
subsets of /proc/ files from which a field is calculable is bounded by
some small constant. It must be constant, as there are a finite number
of fields, and the constant is small, as this is some specific set and
the precise upper bound can be found, and if/when it is found, it is
very likely to be well under a tenth of the total number of subsets of
/proc/ files associated with a process.

I don't have a whole lot to say on this subject. These sound reasonable.
