Hi, sorry I wasn't clear, I'm using too stock 2.6.8.1. I meant will test
with stock 2.6.7.
Also I think it may be related to some of these changelogs:
very likely:
[PATCH] BIO page refcounting fix:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1807.25.6
I'll try to patch -r this and test on Monday.
these changesets are also cdrom or bio related, althought I don't think 
are causing any trouble:
bio_copy_user() cleanups and fixes:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1807.38.2
[PATCH] fix cdrom cdda rip single frame dma fall back
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1807.1.68
