hm.
I've been permadropping Andi's
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt-current/patches/sched-clock-share
because it causes a lockup when initscripts start ondemand on my
single-CPU, CONFIG_SMP=n Vaio.
I don't know _why_ it locks up - I traced it down to the
write_seqlock_irq() which you have just removed.  But write_seqlock()
doesn't loop with CONFIG_SMP=n builds, so a hang there is quite mysterious.
Anyway, your patch might make that hang go away.  We'll see.
