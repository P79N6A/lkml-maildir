Always use 'strings -a'... "search the entire file, not just what you
think my be segments containing text."
[cramer:tty4]dominion:/lib/[9:03pm]:strings -a libc.so.5.3.12 |grep nsswitch
/etc/nsswitch.conf
That's the only libc5 I have with nss enabled.  All the others (include
5.4.44) are straight resolv+.
