So Linus is allowed to arbitarily export other peoples contributions ? I
think we need to clear this one up and understand what people think the
actual rules are around here. As I understand it the original code was
a) extracted from bttv and is code which I and DaveM partly wrote
b) was submitted by Gerd who did the extra work and kept it as _GPL when he 
   first exported it. (in 2.4 its relevant to expose it as we have the V4L1
   not V4L2 interface)
Nobody seems to have remembered to ask permission around here
