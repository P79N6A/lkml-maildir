There are incremental / O(1) methods for filling the directory as well.
Also, a tree does not preclude additional hashing. Personally, I'd
consider O(N) catastrophic as well, especially when done on multiple
cpus simultaneously. In fact, a large chunk of this is obtaining hard
bounds on the hold time of the tasklist_lock so writers have a remote
chance of getting into critical sections.
Another very important aspect of it is that the tasklist cachelines
aren't incessantly pounded, which is important even for UP.
At any rate, if you care to send something to me I will doublecheck
whether it NMI oopses on my machines.
Cheers,
Bill
