Yup, right now I use a separate account (not in wheel) for web browsing,
which using Janak's unshare() patch and a small pam library gets its own
namespace which can't see my dmcrypted home partition and has private
/tmp.  File sharing is done through a non-standard tmp, just to prevent
scripts from using it.
Pretty convenient, but it really wants some stronger isolation.  You'd
think I'd at least use my bsdjail to keep unix sockets and such safe...
Anyway, real containers would indeed be far more convenient, or at least
prettier.
