Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c(124): remark #593: variable "bootmap_size" was set but 
never used
The source code is
    unsigned long start_pfn, end_pfn, bootmap_pages, bootmap_size, 
bootmap_start;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
