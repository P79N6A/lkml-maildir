Subject: [MTD] NAND: Fix ams-delta after core conversion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/8/252

The recent hwctrl core conversion for MTD NAND devices broke the Amstrad
Delta driver. This fixes it up and uses the existing control line
defines rather than unclear magic numbers.
