Yup, I used to do the other one too but nowadays, I much prefer not
wasting that additional line unless specific circumstances, like I
want a kind of "title" in front of a whole block of other definitions
with their own comments.
Something like:
/*
 * foo management stuff
 */
/* This puts the bar in the foo
 */
code code code code
/* This does something you don't want to know about
 */
code code code code
But does it realy matter that much ? :-)
Cheers,
Ben.
