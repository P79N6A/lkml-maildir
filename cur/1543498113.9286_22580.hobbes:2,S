Well you could always use an internet IP style addressing format (ie, if the
first byte is < 128, you get 24 bits for the minor number, otherwise you get 16
bits for the minor number).
I recall that when I worked for the Open Software Foundation, their solution
was a system call that gave you the shift/mask amount to separate the major and
minor numbers (ie, if you needed more minor numbers, you configured the kernel
to use maybe 12 bits for the major number, and 20 bits for the minor number).
We modified the library and include files to use this system call.
