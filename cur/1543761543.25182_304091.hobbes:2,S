It's not clear what the actual bug is here.  When you say that
__sync_single_inode() panics over the list pointers, who was it that
poisoned them?  dispose_list()?
Certainly isofs_fill_super() could trivially be rewritten to not do the
iget()/iput() but we should be sure that that's really the bug.  The inode
lifetime management is rather messy, I'm afraid.
