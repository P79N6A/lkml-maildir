correct.

Trying to exclude all locking activity by 'lesser' tasks (unrelated to
the higher-prio tasks) while a higher-prio task is running is a quite
fragile concept i believe, and it's also pointless: just think about
SMP, or an RT task sleeping for short periods of time for whatever
reason.
This effect can be very well avoided by taking both locks, and this also
better matches the real locking scenarios that happen in the Linux
kernel.

note that it's (probably worse than-) exponentially more unlikely for a
test to be able to generate the worst-case.

why? It is quite rare for there to be even 4-deep locking structures in
the kernel, and even then, it's even rarer that they get accessed in
such an arbitrary-deep manner. Note that task-B can only steal the lock
from task-A because the following locking pattern is allowed:
	L1,UL1		[X]
besides:
	L1,L2,UL1,UL2	[Y]
In Linux, if there's 2-deep locking, it is much more common for only [Y]
to be allowed, for which the formula is still "f(N) = N". Or even if
both [X] and [Y] is allowed, 3-deep or 4-deep locking with [X] and [Y]
allowed as well is quite rare. Not only is this rare, it's _even_ rarer
that no code within that 4-lock-protected region may end up blocking on
an external interrupt. So what you are trying to solve is a very narrow
case i believe.

we could try wakeup-retry instead of pass-lock, although pass-lock still
feels more robust. Relying on UP-starvation to reduce your latencies is
quite ... fragile.
Also, pass-lock performs better because the woken up task does not have
to touch the lock structure anymore, up until it has to release it.
(which gives the CPU(s) more time to optimize things, especially on
SMP.) But if you send a separate patch for that alone (to implement the
'released' state) then we'll be able to see the costs in isolation.
