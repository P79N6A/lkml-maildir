The interrupt state doesn't tell us whether we can schedule.  It
tells us when we can't schedule, which is different from when we
can.  For example:
	spin_lock(foo_lock);
	...
	printk("blah blah blah\n");
	...
	spin_unlock(foo_lock);
This context is non-preemptable, but doesn't have IRQs disabled.
The solution would be to keep a "spinlock depth" counter, but
obviously that's not a possibility.
I would agree that the most correct thing to do would be to export
touch_nmi_watchdog()... if only Linus would accept the arguments
_for_ exporting it.
