The cable is of standard length, which I believe is 18".  It came with the
drive.  I only have one drive plugged into it.  I thought it was odd tha
/proc/ide/via only showed the cable as 40w also, but I assumed that was
because my chipset doesn't know what 80-pin cables are...am I wrong?  In
any case, it's sounding more and more that there's not much I can do to
remedy this problem. :/  Oh well, I'm probably due for a motherboard
upgrade in any case.
Thanks,
Ryan
