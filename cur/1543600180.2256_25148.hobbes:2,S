The S/390 unaligned.h macros are just direct assignments because the
S/390 hardware normally *allows* unaligned accesses just fine.
It is only *atomic* accesses (those implemented using the S/390
compare-and-swap instruction) that need to be word aligned; this includes
the atomic bit operations that reiserfs appears to be using.
If these instructions really *need* to be atomic, then reiserfs should
ensure they are performed on properly aligned data, or else there might
be subtle bugs even on Intel, because the operations will not actually
be atomic (even though they don't trap).
If you say that reiserfs doesn't really need these operations to be
atomic because they run under other locks anyway, then they should not
be using atomic operations in the first place; this will only cause
unnecessary slowdown even on Intel.
