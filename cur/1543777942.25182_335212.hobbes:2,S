The bulk of the longest lines are in the sound and drivers subtrees.
One example on the "high end", with 546 chars in one line:
==
drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c:
  %2d	 %5d %5d %5d    %5d %5d %5d	   %5d %5d %5d\n", TargetID, TargetStatistics[TargetID].CommandAbortsRequested, TargetStatistics[TargetID].CommandAbortsAttempted, TargetStatistics[TargetID].CommandAbortsCompleted, TargetStatistics[TargetID].BusDeviceResetsRequested, TargetStatistics[TargetID].BusDeviceResetsAttempted, TargetStatistics[TargetID].BusDeviceResetsCompleted, TargetStatistics[TargetID].HostAdapterResetsRequested, TargetStatistics[TargetID].HostAdapterResetsAttempted, TargetStatistics[TargetID].HostAdapterResetsCompleted);
==
Clearly, it would be unrepresentative of certain coding styles in drivers
and sound to claim they closely followed an 80 column constraint.
Perhaps the spacing guide should acknowledge this, with some qualification
such as:
   The core kernel code (as apposed to some driver code) tends to keep
   source line lengths below 80 columns.  When changing such code, respect
   the line length constraints of nearby code.
