On ibiblio.org is 
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/ftp-archives/sunsite.unc.edu/Nov-06-1994/GCC/libc-4.5.26.tar.gz
This one contains
libc-linux/sysdeps/linux/_errlist.c dated from 04/14/1993. Unfortunately
it does not contain a copyright notice. 
Files from glibc in this package come with a FSF Copyright Notice, 
so its probably not from glibc. Does somebody recognize this file?
