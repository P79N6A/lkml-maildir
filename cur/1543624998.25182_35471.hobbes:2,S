I tried to work round this by applying some patches which I require but 
which Linus hasn't yet taken _only_ in my working tree, not actually 
committing them. 
But then BK wouldn't even let me pull from Linus' tree any more, because I 
had locked and modified files. That also seems to be a fundamental flaw.
