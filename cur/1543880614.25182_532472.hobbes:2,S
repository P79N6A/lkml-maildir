It's because the userspace headers have been processed with unifdef to 
remove any sections which are inside #ifdef __KERNEL__, since userspace 
apps are not supposed to see those sections.
I'm not sure why you want to use a semaphore in a userspace program. 
Even if you can get it to compile, they definitely won't function 
properly. Aside from the legal issues (using internal kernel code like 
that would make your program a derived work of the kernel and thus 
covered under the GPL).
