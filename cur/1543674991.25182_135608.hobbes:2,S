I thought about this before, but I don't think there is much to optimize. 
The PG_arch_1 bit is the only optimization which makes sense and setting 
it by default to dirty, makes it a lot easier for PIO drivers. PIO 
transfers are really the smallest problem as drivers write only into not 
uptodate and so not mapped pages. We have to be more careful with other 
writes, that they always call flush_dcache_page().
The point I don't like about update_mmu_cache() is that it's called 
_after_ set_pte(). Practically it's maybe not a problem right now, but 
the cache synchronization should happen before set_pte().
bye, Roman
