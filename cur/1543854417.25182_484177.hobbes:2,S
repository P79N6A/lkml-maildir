I really don't trust dbsize. The driver writer can pass in the wrong 
number. Whereas ARRAY_SIZE will always be correct. Lets take the position 
that we use dbsize then we need to test if dbsize is greater than the 
really size of the modedb. The dbsize parameter was for the days before we
had ARRAY_SIZE.

      if (dbsize > ARRAY_SIZE(db))
	dbsize = ARRAY_SIZE(db);
