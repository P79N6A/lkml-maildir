Let me guess. The card is actually on a TP wire, but is misdetected as
BNC.
And then no matter how hard it tries to send things on its BNC interface
it never reaches anyone :)
I normally get:
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 60 08 62 8b d7, IRQ 10.
                            ^^^^^^^
but I believe I have had this happen to me as well (once).
If the driver is loaded as a module you can tell it the transceiver type,
go visit:
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/3c509.html
But I don't know if telling the driver which type also tells the card. Nor
do I know if it is the card that is confused or if it is only the driver.
