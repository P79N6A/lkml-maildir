What boot slowdown? 
I assume any practical CPU hotplug will have a way to detect it 
at boot - e.g. ACPI will probably need to tell you about spare
CPUs that could be started or there is a command line option.
My request was basically to set a flag when "CPU hotplug possible"
is detected and then only use the slow fast path method when
CPU hotplug is possible.
Actually that was only the second best solution, better would
be to just fix the relatively obscure race in the CPU hotplug bootup
path, but Ashok for some reason seems to be very adverse to that
option.
