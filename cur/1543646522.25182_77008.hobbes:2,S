As promised, here is a patch against 2.5.40.
The 2.5 V4L interface looks like it will provide a way for multiple users to
use the same camera simultaneously, but that's a fairly drastic change, and
I'd like to start with something that is pretty well tested [at least by
me]. So, this patch is a sraight forward-port of the 2.4 version posted a
few days ago.

If desired, I'll create a patch of the 2.4 version as well.
Thanks,
John
