You don't seem to be any ifdefs for anything. I guess that's ok if the
final virtualization will be really light weight (let's say not more
than a few KB of additional memory including runtime overhead). But
somehow I guess it will be heavier. What are the plans to allow to
CONFIG it all out for small systems?
