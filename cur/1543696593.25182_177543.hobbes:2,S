You can't read. Point closed.
NOBODY IS SENDING ME PATCHES. 
What part of "open source" do you not understand? 
SATA devices work fine. They have all the SCSI infrastructure working for
them. They'll "just work", even though I fervently hope that we can move
them over to the block device layer later to make them work more
efficiently.
As per the MO device that wants ide-scsi, send out patches to the kernel
mailing list, and maybe the person can test it. I certainly can't test it.
My point is that YOU ARE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. It does not help to 
complain to me - since I don't even have the hardware to test anything 
with. I fixed the IDE CD burning issue. That I had hardware for, and knew 
how to fix properly. 
Now it's your turn. Instead of wasting my time complaining, how about you 
put up or shut up? Show me the code. THEN post it. Until you do, there's 
no point to your mails.
