This can easily be worked around: The creator of the segments puts a
random number at the beginning of the segment, sort of a "signature",
and when he communicates the shmid to other processes, he also tells
them the signature. The attaching processes then check whether the
signature they find in the segment is the same as the one they got
communicated.
This technique is employed in XFree86 4.0.
