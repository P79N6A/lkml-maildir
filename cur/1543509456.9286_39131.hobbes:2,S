I am having some difficulty with the ext2 file systems. I need to generate a
file that will be > 5 Gigabytes, and there appears to be a file size cap at
approximately 2 Gig. I am running what appears to be a version 2.0.36
Kernel. Is there anything I can adjust, or do to increase the maximum file
size? Or is there a newer kernel that may work?
Thanks,
Keith Blankenship
