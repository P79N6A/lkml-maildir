     Oh how I wish this were true!
     Unfortunately, 2.2.x is NOT stable on Sparc multi-CPU platforms, at least
not on 32-bit hardware platforms.
     I have 2.2.10 running on two SS-10's with quad Ross Hypersparc RTK-625
CPU's, one has 90mhz the other 100mhz CPU's, and I still have the spin_lock
problems on a frequent basis (average about once every other day).  I had this
same problem on a Sun 4/670MP with dual Hypersparc.  This problem has existing
in some of the 2.1.x kernels and every 2.2.x kernel since 2.2.0.  It has gotten
better, 2.2.0 would lock with scrolling spin_lock messages sometimes before it
even made it all the way up into multi-user mode, whereas 2.2.10 on the average
takes a couple of days, but it is STILL bad.
     One machine is a news server running INN 1.7.x, the other is a web server
running Apache 1.3.3p3.
     2.0.35 was completely stable on both machines, except that 2.0.35 would
frequently hang during fsck's.
     Why don't I go back to 2.0.35?  Because 2.2.10 is a MASSIVE improvement in
performance, both machines were nearly maxed on CPU before, now they're
averaging around 10% CPU occupancy.  News could hardly keep up before, now it's
mostly idle.  In short the performance is a big win but this spin_lock evil bug
is really a major frustration.
