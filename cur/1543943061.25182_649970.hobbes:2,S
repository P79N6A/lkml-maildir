Ok, I was wrong. The code really *does* compile to that insane
	a3 14 00 00 00          mov    %eax,0x14
by your compiler.
That's the
	asc_dvc_varp->overrun_buf = kzalloc(ASC_OVERRUN_BSIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
thing, and gcc seems to have decided that it can statically prove that 
asc_dvc_varp is NULL.
Quite frankly, I don't see that being true. But you have some patches in 
your tree that I haven't followed, so.. Are you sure the patches applied 
to the right spot? The patch I saw added that kzalloc() to the _end_ of 
the function (long after asc_dvc_varp was initialized), maybe that one got 
mis-applied?
Or maybe your compiler version is simply totally broken.
