that's for a branch that you don't get via libata-dev#ALL, #mv-ahci-pata.

see Alan's comments.  I've been ignoring pata_acpi for a while, because 
IMO it always needed work.

I'm pretty much this is obsolete.  Tejun?

are other pata_platform people happy with this?  I don't know embedded 
well enough to know if adding this struct member will break things.

should be combined, really.  will merge eventually.  basic concept OK, 
but need to review in depth.

I will apply what I can, but it seems there are lifetime problems

seemed mostly OK to me.  what comments did I miss?

No idea.  I would poke Alan.  Probably drop.

Needs a bug fix, so that the newly modified loop doesn't scan the final 
phy id, then loop back around to scan the first again.

FWIW bonding stuff should go to me, since it lives mostly in drivers/net

Any of the above worth 2.6.23?  Just wondering if they were useful 
cleanups / minor fixes prior to new aops patches?

Just the general march of progress on new hardware :)
I would like to see this support merged in /some/ form.  We've been 
telling Intel for years they were sillyheads for not bothering with an 
IOMMU.  Now that they have, we should give them a cookie and support 
good technology.
