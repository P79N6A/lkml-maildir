Some special boot time options?

Are you sure that your boot messages are directed to the matroxfb and
not to the vesa?
In the past keyword for selecting matroxfb options was 'video=matrox:...',
while now it is 'video=matroxfb:...', so you may have to modify your
lilo.conf line (and do not ask me why these two letters were added if
we have video= prefix... I do not know).
                                            Best regards,
