Well, 7 hours is often not enough for memtest86, I usually recommend 24
hours if there are signs of bad hardware.  But other than that, I can't
think of anything ext3-related --- ext3 simply doesn't ever set that
flag.  If it's being set, something is stomping on ext3's transaction
struct.  That _could_ be the kernel, but it could be just about anything
touching memory after it's freed; or it could be bad hardware.
What modules are you using?  Is there anything unusual in common between
your machine or its use and that in #115935?  
Rebuilding the kernel to enable slab debugging may well be useful if
there's something stomping on transaction structs.
Cheers,
 Stephen
