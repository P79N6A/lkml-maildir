If the driver doesn't define bios_param, the scsi core calls
scsicam_bios_param, which seems to do everything this patch does,
and more.
A quick survey suggests that most drivers should have their bios_param
methods deleted.  Was there a particular problem you found with the
default scsicam_bios_param implementation?
