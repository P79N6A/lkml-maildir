Yes, I ran the test on a HP Omnibook 600 (PIII@900)

No other load, just top and a less of a few files.

No load, but preemption.

In any case I'll run again the test with the 4.1 version of Unix Bench.
I'll post the result using as "baseline" the results of the 2.4.19 again 2.5.33 and hopefully 2.4.20-pre5aa1.
