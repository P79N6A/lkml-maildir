When I use my external case as Firewire or USB 2.0 I got the error on the 
kernel syslog:
sr 0:0:0:0: Device not ready.
last message repeated 187 times
Same using amdtp FireWire Driver and usb-storage driver.
but the drive keeps writing and the media finish and close as espected on the 
95% of times, the other 5% :(.
This does not happen when the drive is on IDE interface, my kernel verison is: 
2.6.14/12, and the Drive is a Pioneer DVR110D and A07 both the same onto an 
ADS Tech BOX.
Regards
