I haven't seen this, but I actually haven't done much srp testing with
post-2.6.23 kernels.  From a quick skim through the code, I would
guess that one of the calls to transport_container_unregister() in
srp_release_transport() (which is called one module unload) is
failing and leaving something bogus on the attribute_container_list.
This could because the underlying call to attribute_container_unregister()
fails because the k_list is not empty.  I don't know if this is some
sort of leak in the ib_srp driver, or something broken elsewhere...
