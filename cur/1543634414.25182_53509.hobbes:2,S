From: "Christopher A. Baumbauer" <>
Subject: [PATCH] - patch-kernel 2.4.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/6/20/37

Added support for patching in the pre-release patches (dept. of 
redundancy dept.) to the kernel tree.  Nothing major, but along the same 
lines as the -ac patch option (also works the same way, except for using 
-pre instead).  Finally, if there is a discussion, could you please cc 
me directly since I'm not on the list.
Ciao,
Chris Baumbauer
