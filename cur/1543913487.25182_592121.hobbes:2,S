I would prefer to:
 - make default_utf=1 in the source
 - add "default_utf8 ? VC_UNICODE : VC_XLATE" to the keyboard code
   as your patch does
 - and do away with the new CONFIG_ option, since, surprise, surprise,
   you can change it at runtime, so there is no need to do it
   at compile-time too.
