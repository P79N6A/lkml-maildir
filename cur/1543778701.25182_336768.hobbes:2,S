No puzzle; that's not how they're defined.  Both of them cause the
device to quiesce that device's activity.  But:
 - shutdown() is a "dirty shutdown OK" heads-up for some level
   of restart/reboot; hardware will be completely re-initialized
   later, normally with hardware level resets and OS rebooting.
 - freeze() is a "clean shutdown only" that normally sees hardware
   state preserved, and is followed by suspend() or resume().
Or so I had understood.  That does suggest why having FREEZE in the
reboot path could be trouble:  you could be rebooting because that
hardware won't do a clean shutdown!
