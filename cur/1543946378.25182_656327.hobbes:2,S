Don't forget the "hooks for desktop" :)
Basically in all situations, the kernel needs to warn at the same point
in time: when the system is about to run out of RAM for anonymous pages.
In the desktop case, that leads to swapping (and programs can free memory).
In the embedded case, it leads to OOM (and a management program can kill or
restart something else, or a program can restart itself).
In the HPC case, it leads to swapping (and a management program can kill or
restart something else).
I do not see the kernel side being different between these situations, only
userspace reacts differently in the different scenarios.
Am I overlooking something?
