Shouldn't the algorithm be: 
- If (current_access == write )
	free (swap_page);
  else
 	map (page, READONLY)
and 
  when a write access happens, we fault again, and map free the 
  swap-page as it is now dirty anyway. 
The extra fault when the first access is a read (e.g. in a
read-modify-write case) will seem like a lot of overhead, but if you
save an IO in 1% of the cases, it will be worth it...
Is swap allocated "congruently"? I didn't think so. That would mean
that if one page of a process has to be paged out, you allocate an
area on the swap that maps directly on the whole adressing space of
that process. That way prefetching stuff from swap can actually help a
lot.
