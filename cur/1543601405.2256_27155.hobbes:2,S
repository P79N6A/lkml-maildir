Hm, are you sure about this? Here is /proc/meminfo after a night of heavy nfs
action (we are at the server side):

You see most mem found its way in the active queue. If you talk about
"aggressive" meaning aggressively aged or even freed, I cannot see it.
I will go on for another day without additional patching and see how things
evolve and how the system behaves in interactive situation.
Ah, another thing to mention. I got some _new_ alloc failures:
Sep 18 04:16:49 admin kernel: nfsd __alloc_pages: 1-order allocation failed
(gfp=0x20/0) from c012de72
Sep 18 04:17:27 admin kernel: nfsd __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed
(gfp=0x1d2/0) from c012de72
Sep 18 04:21:18 admin kernel: gzip __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed
(gfp=0x1d2/0) from c012de72
c012de5c T _alloc_pages 
c012de74 t balance_classzone
Hope this helps,
Stephan
