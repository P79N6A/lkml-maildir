It's basically not working as specified for clustered hierarchical, and
in truth the specification can never be met. As it stands most calls to
it are lethal on such systems, especially those using physical destmod.
I'd prefer to have it redesigned for some validity checking and error
returns as on such systems the impossible destinations serve no purpose
but raising MCE's and/or deadlocking the box.
