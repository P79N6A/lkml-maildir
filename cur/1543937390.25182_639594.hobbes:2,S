In the early days of clone PCs, as you know but perhaps many on this
list might not, the bus speed could be changed, but this was
user-selectable.  For such a machine, delay values can be pre-calculated
for each bus speed, and a kernel parameter set accordingly.  Or are you
saying that the characteristics of the bus on a given machine vary for
reasons other than user selection?
The fact that busses run at different speeds on different machines is
not a problem because the delay value can be determined for each given
machine.
The question is, for a given machine, can we determine a delay value
instead of using a junk I/O?
