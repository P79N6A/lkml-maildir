This looks ok to me.  &sw_desc->group_list is the head of a new list of
descriptors to be added to the chain.  old_chain_tail is youngest
descriptor at the end of the current channel chain.
Before list_splice_init:
old_chain_tail->next = channel_chain_head
channel_chain_head->prev = old_chain_tail
new_chain_start->prev = sw_desc->group_list;
new_chain_end->next = sw_desc->group_list;
After list_splice_init:
new_chain_start->prev = old_chain_tail
old_chain_tail->next = new_chain_start
new_chain_end->next = channel_chain_head
channel_chain_head->prev = new_chain_end
sw_desc->group_list is empty
