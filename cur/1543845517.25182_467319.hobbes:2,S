Just the ones in the comment, really - it assumes that the caller has a
single ref on the file.  ie: we're within a system call which passed in an
fd, or within a pagefault and this file* is current->mm->some_vma->vm_file.
You _might_ get into trouble if using it against some file* which belongs
to a different process, and if you don't already have a ref on that file*. 
But that's usually a bug anyway, unless the code is aware of and is
exploiting the RCU management of these things.
There are lots of example usages around the place.

Thanks.
