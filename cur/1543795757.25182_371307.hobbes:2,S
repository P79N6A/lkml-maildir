idle=poll is also frequently done for performance reasons [it reduces 
idle wakeup latency by 10 usecs] - while it could be turned off if the 
system has been idle for some time. E.g. cpufreqd could sample idle time 
and turn on/off idle=poll. High-performance setups could enable it all 
the time.
as long as it can be done with zero-cost, i dont see why Steven's patch 
wouldnt be a plus for us. It's a performance thing, and having runtime 
switches for seemless performance features cannot be bad.
