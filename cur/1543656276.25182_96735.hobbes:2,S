The errata is something like "all P6's report SEP, but it doesn't
actually _work_ on anything before the third stepping".
However, that should _not_ be handled by magic sysenter-specific code.
That's what the per-vendor cpu feature fixups are there for, so that these
kinds of bugs get fixed in _one_ place (initialization) and not in all the
users of the feature flags.
In fact, we already have that code in the proper place, namely
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel.c:
        /* SEP CPUID bug: Pentium Pro reports SEP but doesn't have it */
        if ( c->x86 == 6 && c->x86_model < 3 && c->x86_mask < 3 )
                clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_SEP, c->x86_capability);
so the stuff I sent out should work on everything.
(Modulo the missing syscall page I already mentioned and potential bugs
in the code itself, of course ;)
