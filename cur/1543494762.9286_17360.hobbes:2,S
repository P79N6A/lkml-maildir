are you sure?  I had pretty similar problems with a NI6510SC ISA card (AM79C60)
in an old DX2/66 system whenever there is a bit high netload from this PC
(even using NFS with 1k block size was too fast and the card/driver locked up
pretty frequently).
now, recently I raised HZ for this PC from 100 to 1024 (for completely unrelated
reasons) and to my big surprise this fixed all those network hangs, now sustained
transfer and 8k NFS are no problem at all...
I don't know if this really can be compared and I have no idea why HZ=1024
results in much better networking than HZ=100 and I haven't spent any time
trying to figure out what's going on.
