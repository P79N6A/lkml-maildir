So drop your support for that distribution. I do not see the problem here. Look
at PS/2 support as another example. Supporting the IBM PS/2 machines is
commercially impractical and has no business case. Red Hat won't install on
a PS/2 machine. Debian has different constraints and guess what - Debian 
installs beautifully on a PS/2.
