I wonder if there is still a bug in the e2fsck code for re-hashing
directories?  It shouldn't be possible to have e2fsck complete and
there still be an error in the filesystem (ok, sometimes it happens,
but in those cases it spews a lot of warnings about the filesystem
not being fixed yet and to run manually).
What else is strange (at least to me) is e2fsck "optimizing directories"
on a reboot.  My understanding at least is that this would be done only
when explicitly asked for, otherwise it might slow down booting a lot,
and as you can see it adds to the possibility of corrupting the fs when
e2fsck should only be fixing it.
Cheers, Andreas
