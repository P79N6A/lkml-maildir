I also made the mistake of using in_atomic() wrong in one of my last
patch sets. In my case this was pointed out by the reviewers. Is there
some documentation in the kernel tree how and when in_atomic() is used
right? If not I think its worth writing a little file that explains the
important details about the correct use of in_atomic() :-)
