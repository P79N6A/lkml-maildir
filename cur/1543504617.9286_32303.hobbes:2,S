As I can see from the patches for 2.3.7 and later there has been
a lot of activity in the linux/fs area. 
I am maintaining the steganographic file system. As it cannot go
into mainstream kernel by its very nature (not yet at least),
I have to update it to vfs changes regularly. Unfortunately I
missed the last 2 months of kernel development as I was taking
a big load of exams.
Is there any comprehensive information what has changed? If not
I may have to do a complete rewrite that is enhancing the code
for an exisiting file system with steganographic features (not
too bad a thing because I could use ext2 this time instead of
minix). In this case I would like to know when the new fs code
is stabilized so I don't have to do rewrites all over every
few kernel versions.
Anyhow thnx for any information!
P.S.: In case you're interested:
