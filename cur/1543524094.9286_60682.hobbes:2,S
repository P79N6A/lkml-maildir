someone tried to call a function pointer, but the pointer was
uninitialized (NULL).

And the oops was caused by the module, but ksymoops couldn't find the
symbol map for the module.
Could you try "insmod -m joy-creative" instead of "modprobe
joy-creative"? insmod should print a module map, and then you can use
that module map for ksymoops.
