Its sufficient to stop bad things happening, its not sufficient to get
the desired end user result of being able to read their disk if it moved
controller. Bartlomiej pointed out that because of the other traps the
problem doesn't occur right now except moving a disk.
I'll post an additional diff tomorrow which adds hwif->dma_addressing
(or dma_lba48 given the changes to naming people seem to prefer) so that
can get fixed.
