Why should it?  Note that this is _not_ what happens with e.g. git://
URLs.  And while we are at it, who said that refs/master even exists?
AFAICS, it's a convention and no more - it doesn't have to be there.
Even if it does exist, I'd say that behaviour of git:// makes more sense -
it sets HEAD to the same thing we have in remote; if it's refs/master,
so be it, if it's set to a different branch, we start on the same branch.
