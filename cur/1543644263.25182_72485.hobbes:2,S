Agreed, except that I think that the old kernel has been re-loaded instead of the new one, because lilo hasn't been re-run.
Lilo does not automatically re-read it's config file, like grub does, (apparently, I use lilo exclusively), and you need to run lilo before re-booting after installing a new kernel image.
