Well when I ran `ldconfig -v` to get the version number that was all
she wrote. Rebooting, I couldn't do anything. init just kept trying
to spwan `gettys`, they would seg-fault. I could't log in.
Now, I'm trying to be able to get lilo to work (brand new system).
I cam boot from a floppy, but that's it. This has been a St Valentine's
day massacre.
Here's lilo.conf
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.1
	label=new
	root=/dev/sda1
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.1
	read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7
	label=linux
	root=/dev/sda1
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.0.36-0.7.img
	read-only
Modules are found. But it can't find the root file-system which is
/dev/sda1 as specified.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
