Just serio0 and serio1.

OK, anything else I should try?
Why does it only fail when I have *both* intel_agp and i8042 aux?
In the SysRq-T trace I see one interesting process: most things are
in D state in refrigerator(), but sh shows the following traceback:
wait_for_completion
call_usermodehelper
kobject_hotplug
kobject_del
class_device_del
class_device_unregister
mousedev_disconnect
input_unregister_device
alps_disconnect
psmouse_disconnect
serio_driver_remove
device_release_driver
serio_release_driver
serio_resume
resume_device
dpm_resume
device_resume
swsusp_write
pm_suspend_disk
enter_state
state_store
subsys_attr_store
flush_write_buffer
sysfs_write_file
...
That seems odd to me...
Also, khelper has the following trace:
io_schedule
sync_buffer
__wait_on_bit
out_of_line_wait_on_bit
ext3_find_entry
ext3_lookup
real_lookup
do_lookup
__link_path_walk
link_path_walk
path_lookup
open_exec
do_execve
...
