Great, thanks for giving this a look-over, much appreciated.

Good catch, my ORB cancellation is a bit rough, and I believe there are a 
couple of races there, though I haven't been able to actually trigger these. 
When cancelling an ORB I need to cancel the ORB, the pending transaction and 
potentially the packet queued for DMA in the fw-ohci driver.  This is not 
fully in place yet and I need to sit down and audit this path.

Oh, the ORBs are SBP-2 specific data structures, struct fw_transaction is 
probably what corresponds to USB URBs.  This struct is defined in 
fw-transaction.h and is available for embedding into other structs, such as 
struct sbp2_orb in fw-sbp2.  Is that what you're suggesting against, and what 
are the problems with this approach?
As for passing DMA-mapped buffers, do you mean that fw_send_request (or code 
below that function) should map the payload as it currently does as opposed to 
callers pre-mapping DMA buffers?

An SBP-2 ORB transaction sequence consists of a number of FireWire 
transactions.  First the initiator prepares an SBP-2 ORB (object request 
block) in host memory and maps this for DMA.  Then the initiators sends its 
bus address and the physical address of the ORB to the SBP-2 device.  This is 
the request that complete_transaction deals with.  If we get rcode == 
RCODE_COMPLETE here, we successfully wrote the ORB address to the SBP-2 device 
and we leave the ORB in the list so the SBP-2 transaction can continue.  Any 
other rcode means that the write failed and we need to back out the 
transaction and leave it to upper layers to retry.
The rest of the SBP-2 transaction continues with the SBP-2 device issuing a 
FireWire read transaction to read out the ORB from host memory and then carry 
out the instructions in the ORB.  Once the device has completed the ORB it 
will do a status write to the status address specified in the ORB, at which 
point the SBP-2 transaction is complete.

I guess that should be in pci_probe in fw-ohci.c, but it isn't.  If the 
allocation is in physical memory above the 4G limit, will dma_map_single set 
up a trampoline buffer below 4G if the device DMA mask is 0xffffffff?  I have 
a similar problem when mapping the buffer passed down from the SCSI stack, in 
that I don't know for sure that these buffers are accessible within the first 4G.
Didn't know about dma_mapping_error, cool, will use that.

Yeah, I guess... I did actually track down every function call in the destroy 
path to make sure that they're safe to call on the values that kzalloc sets 
them to.

Yikes, I thought I had most of the dma_map_single error cases handled.

Yeah, your changes for fw-sbp2.c makes sense, the byteswapping in-place always 
felt kinda iffy.  None of the wire structs have any 16-bit fields, though, 
I've intentionally made them all 32 bit values.  The SBP-2 ORBs have 16 bit 
values in them but they never cross 32 bit boundaries, and they're shifted and 
or'ed together so that when they're byteswapped they end up in the right 
places.  But your changes make it a little more clear and I can then use 
__be32 in the wirte structs.
For fw-transaction.c and code touching the FireWire headers 
(fw_packet::header[4]) the rule is that it's CPU endian data.  This is the 
only way to avoid unecessary swaps.  The OHCI controller will expect the 
headers to be little endian but byteswap them as 32 bit words as it sends out 
the packets.  So, ironically, on big endian architechtures we need to byteswap 
the headers to little endian when setting up DMA.  So since the header byte 
swapping depends on the host controller, it only makes sense that the stack 
doesn't swap, but leaves that to the controller.

Indeed, I've just moved to an in-tree development model now.  I still think 
the out-off-tree model is a good way to prototype, get started and reach 
"critical mass" with your driver.  But as I'm starting to integrate and sync 
with Stefans tree now, an in-tree model is a lot easier to work with.  The 
tree is here
