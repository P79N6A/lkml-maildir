Seems pretty good to me, save for one minor detail:  patches #1/#2 
should be combined together for greater git-bisect happiness.  Ditto for 
patches #3/#4.  Largely harmless in this case, but keeps the git history 
pollution to a minimum.
Caveat reviewer:  I'm not an expert of net/ipv4/* code, so I reviewed 
largely from the driver API perspective.
David, thoughts on merging?  I'm not We could stick this into your tree 
or mine.  Whether yours or mine, I would like to keep the driver and 
net-core patches together in the same git tree.
