Just a "me, too" here.  I see this when using the in-kernel driver.  I'm
now using... 4.12, I think.  At any rate, the error doesn't occur, or at
least occurs to rarely as to escape notice, with this driver.  Might I
suggest the kernel's version be upgraded?  The updated driver was posted
here on lkml some time ago.
