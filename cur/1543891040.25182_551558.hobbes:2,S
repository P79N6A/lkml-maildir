Conditional calls works just like the previous markers in this aspect :
in order to support embedded systems with read-only memory for the text
segment, I leave the choice to disable the "optimized" cond_call as a
config option even if the architecture has the optimized marker flavor.
I use this include scheme because I want to support both the generic and
optimized version at the same time : if a _cond_call is declared with
the CF_OPTIMIZED flags unset, it will use the generic version. This is
useful when we must place cond_calls in locations that present specific
reentrancy issues, such as cond_call, printk, some trap handlers. The
optimized version, when it uses the i386 mechanism to insure correct
code modification, can trigger a trap, which will call into lockdep and
might have other side-effects.
(I am adding this text in the condcall.h header)
