	As opposed to the kernel forcing subtle breakage by specifying
options that break said module?  Don't say that doesn't happen (just
like the kernel has to add/remove compiler switches to make some of its
code work).

	IOW, you not only need a kernel source tree (built, no less,
taking up space) but it needs to be writable!

	Well, the Red Hat kernel tree is designed to allow you to build
against there UP, SMP, and large memory kernels from one tree.  In your
example, you require three(!) fully built kernel trees lying around, each
with a different configuration.  That's a lot of space.
	Granted, Red Hat (as our example) can do what they have to do,
since the generic kernel isn't responsible for whatever Red Hat does.
However, even without their setup, in 2.4 all I have to do is keep
around version.h and autoconf.h and I can usually do the right thing
with one completely clean kernel tree.
