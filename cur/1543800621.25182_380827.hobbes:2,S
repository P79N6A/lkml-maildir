I see - one point is that the two/three underscore versions make
it clear that preempt is required, though, but it might be a bit
over-complicated as you say.
Well, its up to you - please rearrange the patch as you wish and merge
up?

True, but it reduces kernel code, which is always good.

"I think it should not be racy because the function should always be
called with the page table lock held, which disables preempt. I guess
the comment should be explicit about that as well."
Yes, you're right! My bad.

There's still probably a few more counters but the ones covered till now 
should be the most significant ones performance-wise.
