The io card shall transfer data using pci bus mastership mode. In the app notes
of the pci chip (AMCC S5933) they call it "pci bus mastering dma", therefore my
inaccurate description. Sorry for the confusion.

I turned the "enable bus master for pci-to-memory transfers" bits in the S5933
off. The test program uses write calls only, so there should be no reason for
pci-to-memory transfers anyway.

See above. The io card _uses_ pci bus master mode for _reading_ some part of the
cpu's memory, and the errors described above occur! Any explanation possible?

The io card reads data from (physical) memory using pci bus master mode, so no
reason for a segfault. The module is simply in an interruptible_sleep_on phase.

or Ind. computers type CC5 with latest firmware upgrades.

The point is that there is absolutely no output from syslog except for the
occasional NMI message, no oops, no panic, etc. I restarted klogd with "-c 8",
so I get all messages to console. Only the debug stuff from my module is
visible, than it hangs, and I have to use the bit button...
Thanks, Albrecht.
