When the macro does more than sysret it should have a different

ANY? There are certainly some registers alive at this point like rax

Similar.

ENTRY adds alignment. Why do you need that export anyways?

iret_label seems more expressive to me than 1

In many of the CLBR_NONEs there are actually some registers free;
but it might be safer to keep it this way. But if some client can get 
significantly better code with one or two free registers it might 
be worthwhile to investigate.

There's still stack here

I suspect Xen will need much more changes anyways because of its
ring 3 guest. Are these changes sufficient for lguest?
