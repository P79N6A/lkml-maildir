Here's a radical idea.
Have *both* interfaces.
It's what MacOS does. No, really.
Except MacOS does the attribute-oriented version with a user space  
library, and when we have different filesystems using different data  
structures on their structured streams, that doesn't work very well.
So we'd have
(1) a way to open("file/stream") or maybe open_stream("file", "stream") or  
whatever;
and
(2) a way to get/set_attribute(int fd, void *tag, size_t tagsize, void  
*data, size_t datasize) or something similar, for those filesystems which  
have a native structure to one or more forks. (You know, you *could*  
implement that just as an ioctl. Cue replace ioctl with saner mechanism  
thread.)
If you're exceptionally driven, you might even have a way to bind the fs X  
structure to the fs Y streams - the only real application for that I know  
of is MacOS resource format on NTFS streams, though I suspect OS/2 EAs on  
NTFS streams also exists, because NTFS is used as fileserver for Macs and  
has an OS/2 1.x compatibility mode.
Cue Al's "do it via mount" idea here as a way of doing that binding.
