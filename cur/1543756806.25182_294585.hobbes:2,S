There is certainly an issue with reading it early.  But constructing
an additional cpio and sticking it into the initrd block is fairly
simple.  For detecting devices especially in the case that takes
a while that isn't something we need to do early
in the boot process.

Well the data structure is still yet to be defined.  The
question you raised is how to pass it.

Something like that.    I have yet to see a even a proof of concept
of the idea of passing device information, to clean up probes.
Nor am I quite certain if it is really useful.  But when it
happens I am sure we can cope.
