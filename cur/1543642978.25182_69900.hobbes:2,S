Comparing Veritas FS against UFS is like comparing apples
and steak.  Their goals are so diffent it is rediculous.
My comment is that with no apples-apples comparisons (or at
least apples-pears) who knows how good it is.

Don't get me wrong, feature-wise Veritas FS is a great
product.  Their hot resizing (including shrink) is a
must-have feature.  I never had a lick of problems with it
despite flaky GbIX (Gibabit FCAL Interface transceivers).
