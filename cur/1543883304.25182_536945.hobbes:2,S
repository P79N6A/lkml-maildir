well, there are several reports of CFS being significantly better than 
SD on a number of workloads - and i know of only two reports where SD 
was reported to be better than CFS: in Kasper's test (where i'd like to 
know what the "3D stuff" he uses is and take a good look at that 
workload), and another 3D report which was done against -v6. (And even 
in these two reports the 'smoothness advantage' was not dramatic. If you 
know of any other reports then please let me know!)
