Actually, upgrading from 1.4.x version supplied with Slackware 8.0 to
the latest version 1.9.1 solved the SNDCTL_DSP_NONBLOCK problem.
The new problem is now
      val = 0;  // no input sigs get to output
      if (ioctl(mixer_fd, MIXER_WRITE(SOUND_MIXER_OUTSRC), &val) < 0)
      {
         fprintf (stderr, "mixer outsrc failed\n");
Failing, all the other of the many ioctl calls work ok. 
p.s sorry about saying suse, weak memory :-).
