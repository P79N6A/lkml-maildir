Subject: [Trivial 2.5 patch] ips.c remove tqueue.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The ips.c driver wasn't compiling and broke my nightly run last night. 
It doesn't look like they were even using task queues though, so
removing the include fixed it.  Tested that it compiles and boots with
this.
Please apply.
