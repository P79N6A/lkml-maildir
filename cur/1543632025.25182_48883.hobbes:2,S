This is not the argument put forth, but this is definitely where the
political line falls: You either believe in open source or you don't.
No one has summarized this better than Victor:
"The GPL/RTLinux work that we do loses money -- actually, we budget it
under "marketing"."
Regardless of which side of the political spectrum you find yourself,
ask yourself this question:
Do I want to be part of Victor's marketing team?
