  Make the visibility of the entire ACPI submenu dependent on PM.

  given that de-selecting Power Management (PM) de-activates the
entire contents of the ACPI submenu, it seems pointless to leave the
top-level menu entry visible.  but this is just a hack and i'll leave
it to the official maintainers to do it properly. :-)
