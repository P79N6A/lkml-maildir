This sounds even better. We should not need tracing_enabled anymore, since
the buffer size can be changed regardless. tracing_on is more useful to
mmiotrace than tracing_enabled, too, since mmiotrace does not implement
the proper pausing behaviour on the tracing_enabled trigger.
But if Steven wants to keep the "pause" semantics, should there be a
callback dispatched to the tracer from tracing_on, just like there is
from tracing_enabled currently? Of course the callback semantics would
be different and the usual reaction would be to do nothing. It would
only be meaningful to tracers that update data outside the ring buffer,
so that they can properly pause.
