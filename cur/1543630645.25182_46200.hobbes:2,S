Is adding a check for this type of situation (under CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
of course) worth the effort?  One would simply add a 'locks_held' count
for each task and check for zero at certain places such as return to
user mode, and during context switching.
It appears that this was done for 'sparc64', but no other architectures.
I would consider doing this for i386, if anyone would actually use it.
One would think these types of things are easily found, but this example
suggests otherwise.  Has anyone run the kernel through an extensive
(stress) test suite with any of the kernel debug options enabled?
