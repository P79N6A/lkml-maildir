That is why I was proposing to change the IP ID back to a single global
counter, that is just added to the per peer secret. This way you look up
the peer, subtract the secret and then compare against the initial id
saved at socket creation. When packetid<initial drop it. When > 2^16
packets send set the initial packetid to 0 and don't compare anymore
(the whole point of the exercise was to catch old ICMPs from older
sockets on the same port, when the window expired we assume they have
all left the network)

When the peer is created the initial ip id is generated from the
the current time and a secret from the random device. After that the
per peer id is just increased by one like the old global counter.
The complicated fallback is only executed when it was not possible
to get a peer, that only occurs when the peer cache trashes or we
ran out of memory and is unlikely. In this case it would be ok to drop
the ICMP.
