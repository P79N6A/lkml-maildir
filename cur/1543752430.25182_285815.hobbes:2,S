An important thing is that Mr. Torvalds agrees with the embargo, which you never
did, you always applied corrections for security bugs without being concerned
about a disclosure date agreement (which you have your own reasons and arguments 
for, OK).
That makes vendorsec/etc uncomfortable submitting the information to you. 
Great to hear you think differently and is willing to agree on a reasonable
embargo period.
The kernel security list must be higher in hierarchy than vendorsec.
Any information sent to vendorsec must be sent immediately for the kernel
security list and discussed there.
I'm sure one week is enough for vendors to prepare updates, and I'm sure they 
will be fine with it.

We all agree there is no good reason to embargo a kernel bug for more than 
one week, given that the fix is known and settled.

Wonderful.
