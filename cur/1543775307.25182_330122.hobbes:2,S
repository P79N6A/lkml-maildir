Rejected-by: Russell King 8)
The reason is that now we're unable to find out if anyone's doing
udelay(100000000000000000) which breaks on most architectures.
There are a number of compile-time checks that your patch has removed
which catch such things, and as such your patch is not acceptable.
Some architectures have a lower threshold of acceptability for the
maximum udelay value, so it's absolutely necessary to keep this.
