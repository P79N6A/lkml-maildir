The existing libusb based application works fine for PICDEM FS USB
or those based on it (like the Bitwhacker the OP is using).
Please do not add it to the kernel. There are libusb based application
for both the bootloader and the demo application and both are working
fine under Linux (along with Windows and I am trying to get FreeBSD
working).
Last time the demo application has been added to the ldusb and
I think it is not a good idea. But since then I've added patches to
the existing libusb application.
Relevant discussion in thread
'[PATCH 70/78] USB: add picdem device to ldusb'
http://marc.info/?t=117770076400003&r=1&w=2
So please do not do this again. It is not a problem for the libusb
based applications after the patches but it is really not necessary.
Original libusb based application for the bootloader:

Original libusb based application for the Demo which
also includes my patch for libusb-win32.

Updated Patches to detach the kernel driver for both
the bootloader and Demo application.
