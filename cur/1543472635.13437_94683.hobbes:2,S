I don't know what country you are referring to, but most of this
thread has been focused on the US.  In Berne Convention countries for
the last 20 years, a copyright is yours outright even without putting
a notice on your work.  A patent must be defended in the US to remain
valid, and it cannot be defended selectively.
Don't take my word for it; read the FAQs.
