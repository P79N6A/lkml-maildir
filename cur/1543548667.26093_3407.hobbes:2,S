Yes. Assuming that you want to implement the microseconds field on all 
3 timestamps. For NFS I would only need that precision on mtime.
Does anybody else see a need for it on ctime and/or atime?

Sure, but the alternative might be to reserve some bits as an
'operations counter' that is incremented every time an update is
performed. That way you might have milisecond resolution (which is the
sort of resolution that 'jiffies' & friends offers) + a few extra bits
that would be there for make/NFS/... update consistency.
