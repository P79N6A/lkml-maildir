Hi,
the various special softlinks in the proc filesystem (files like
/proc/self/exe, /proc/self/root or /proc/self/fd/[0-9]*) in kernel
version 2.0.36 have a mode of "S_IFLNK | 0700". IMHO this should be
"S_IFLNK | 0500" because not even the superuser or the owner of the link
has permission to remove them.  Practically irrelevant but it would be
more consistent.
And, hm, at the risk of sacrifying a holy cow, wouldn't it make sense for
*all* symlinks to allow other modes than "lrwxrwxrwx"?  I can think of
situations where I would like to allow other people to follow a certain
symlink but want to hide its target.  And it would also be absolutely
straightforward to "chmod -w" a symlink to avoid somebody else
removing it.  Sure, that would require a new system call, just a thought.
Would you mind to cc replies to me?  I'm neither a Linux user nor
subscribed to this list.
Ciao
Guido
