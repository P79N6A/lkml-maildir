4) At least slightly portable.
Anything supported by any similar OS is already ahead, even if it
isn't the perfect API of our dreams. This means kqueue and doors.
If it's not on any BSD or UNIX, then most app developers won't
touch it. Worse yet, it won't appear in programming books, so even
the Linux-only app programmers won't know about it.
Running ideas by the FreeBSD and OpenSolaris developers wouldn't
be a bad idea. Agreement leads to standardization, which leads to
interfaces getting used.
BTW, wrapper libraries that bury the new API under a layer of
gunk are not helpful. One might as well just use the old API.
