Hi Kenji
I think instead of modifying all the arch specific code, you could use the __attribute__(weak)
and define a default dummy funcion in 	drivers/pci/pci.c
void __attribute__((weak)) pcibios_disable_device(struct pci_dev *dev)	{ }
each arch that really needs this can define the override function. That way you dont need to 
put the dummy function in several places, containing your changes to a very few set of files.
Cheers,
