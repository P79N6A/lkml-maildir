I suspect that some device is actually on the IRQ 21, and that's how its IO-APIC line is set up. Later on, its driver tries to assign different IRQ, due to some discrepancy, and the handler gets registered on say IRQ 11, and to a wrong pin, so the actual interrupts go unattended. If this what's happening, the trace will hopefully tell the story. I suggest to boot with "apic=debug" and also perhaps with "pci=routeirq" and collect the trace. You can attach the part up to the point when it reports usb devices set up.
