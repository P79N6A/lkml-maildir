   Why would it crash the sparc?
   If it wasn't there originally, the loop will not find it, and the
   loop will be a no-op.
The loop would be a no-op but the remove_proc_entry call would not.
Perhaps you didn't notice that there too?  It's pretty close to the
loop :-)
tpnt->proc_name in this case is NULL, that is fed to the procfs
unregister code (and next to strncmp), leading to an OOPS on non-x86
during bootup with scsi adapter drivers not in the machine compiled
statically into the kernel.
This is why it would crash on sparc.
   Explain.
Just let me know which part of the above is hard to understand and
I'll try my best to clear things up.  Thanks.
Later,
