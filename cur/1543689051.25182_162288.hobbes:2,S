Subject: Lockups with 2.4.22 on a dual P3/Katmai

Hello.
I'm getting lockups on my dual P3 Katmai system under 2.4.22.  It worked
  fine with 2.4.21-pre4 (I had an uptime of about 130 or so days), but
  I tried to upgrade to 2.4.22 and it's now started locking up.  I get
  no Oops output or anything.  I've tried both the vanilla 2.4.22 and
  the vanilla 2.4.23-pre1 kernels.
Symptoms: screen will occasionally go blank for a split second, then
  the system locks up after about half an hour to two hours (doesn't seem
  to be a strict time).  When it locks up, I don't notice any LEDs on the
  keyboard flashing, and I don't notice any other activity.  The Magic
  SysRq sync and unmount keys have no effect, so far as I can tell.  It
  seems to be truly locked up.  The reset button will, however, reset
  the computer; I don't have to pull the plug.
Any ideas on what might be causing this?  Anything I can do to get
  a better idea what's going on?
Thanks!
-Joseph
