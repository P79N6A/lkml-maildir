I find out it's already defined in pci_ids.h so shouldnt be needed here.
We will update this point later.

That's because we don't want to influence the on-board IDE and other IDE
controller's R/W routine. So it will just works on PROMISE controllers.

If we enable IDEDMA_TIMEOUT, kernel will look for
ide_dma_timeout_revovery() to retry again when drive's DMA timeout.
Thank you for yours efforts to look at this patch.
