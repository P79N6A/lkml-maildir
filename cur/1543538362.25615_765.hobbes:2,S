   There's one for UFS/FFS now on the way in FreeBSD 5.0:  Kirk McKusick
   just released alpha code to do what he calls snapshots, which I'm told
   will enable background fscking, among other things.  See
   
http://people.freebsd.org/~mckusick/snap.tgz
 (or the freebsd-arch
   archives) if you're curious.
That's not a full filesystem consistency checker, though.  He's running
fsck on a consistent snapshot of the filesystem in order to detect
orphaned blocks which can then be freed in the live filesystem.  (The
BSD soft update code can leak blocks from inodes which are open at the
time of a system crash, which is why this is necessary.)
This technique can't be used to deal with arbitrary filesystem
corruption, however.  It only addresses a very specific case which can't
be handled any other way given the BSD Soft Updates approach.
