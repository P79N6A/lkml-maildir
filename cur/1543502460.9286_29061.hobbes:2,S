There were zillions of these messages, all referring
to the same inode number. As a result the machine did not
respond to anything else (it needed to be power cycled).
After inspecting the source I think the printk for this
should only be done when the inode number is different because
it sits in the middle of a tight retry loop. Waiting might
be more appropriate but I'm not sure if that can be done in
this particular case.
