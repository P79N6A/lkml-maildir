Subject: [GIT PATCH] ALSA core fix for 2.6.20-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Takashi asked me to send you this single patch as it conflicted with his
current tree and it is needed before 2.6.20 comes out to fix a userspace
ABI breakage that I caused earlier.
This patch fixes a bug with the sound core when CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED
is enabled.  More details can be found in the patch itself, which will
follow as a reply to this message.
Please pull from:

thanks,
