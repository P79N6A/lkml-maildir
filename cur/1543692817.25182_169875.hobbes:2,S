That is my biggest issue, too.  I really want vserver, but
I don't want to carry around a patch that's any larger than
it needs to be ;)

Yup, that is indeed too much for the LSM interface;  because
of that additional things would seem needed.

Ohhhhhh.  I will need to check this out.  Thanks for the
information.  I've asked some selinux people whether there
was functionality like this and they didn't think so. Good
to see there is something after all ;)
I'll look at this in more detail to see whether it would
be enough to implement virtual host functionality.
