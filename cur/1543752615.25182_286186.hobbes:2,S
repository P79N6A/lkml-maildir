This sounds like more than I bargained for.  I'll leave the patch as-is,
since I don't currently have the means to test a fix for the legacy IO
stuff.  Also because it doesn't crash on my architecture :)
If you get some time, my suggestion is to scrap
pci_remove_legacy_files(), and free the pci_bus->legacy_io field in
pci_remove_bus().  The binary sysfs files will be cleaned up
automatically as the class device is deleted, as described in the
parent.
Thanks-
John
