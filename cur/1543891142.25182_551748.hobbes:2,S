Ah, I didn't realise you were using that yet. I expect ocfs2 is using
VM_CAN_INVALIDATE there anyway.
Hmm, this becomes easier to deal with after page_mkwrite is merged with
->fault. But for now, can we just lock the page at the do_wp_page site
as well, and change the API? All users I have seen want the page locked
there anyway...
