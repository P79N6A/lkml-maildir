You should either upgrade to 2.4.20 or similar or post the question to
RedHat for their kernels. If the problem can be reproduced with
2.4.20, come back here. :)

Sounds a bit like a caching problem. Old value in cache, new value
written to memory, chache line dirty => flushed, old value written to
memory again. But it could also be something else.
