I may have spoke too soon. 
When I say "not working" I mean that physically inserting the card
causes no hotplug activity to happen. If I do a "cardctl insert" then
card is brought up.
With a IBM T4X do you have to use "cardctl insert" or is just sliding
the card in enough? For a period of time earlier today just sliding the
card in was enough. I can't get that behavior back though.
