Which means it is not completely predictable, which means there is
going to be some entropy in there...

Well now, *that's* a pain.
But for us embedded folks who control our boot ROM there is the
potential to grab some entropy from that melting ghost.

Perfect!  So if some embedded-types do manage to dig up some entropy
from the end/beginning of the world, we will have a place to put it
where it will be put to use.  Cool.
Thanks,
-kb, the Kent who suggests a comment left in that code might prevent
someone from "fixing" it at a later date.
