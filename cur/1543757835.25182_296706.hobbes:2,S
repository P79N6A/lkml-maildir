Trying to run an old server with a new kernel. A connection
fails with "interrupted system call" as soon as a client
attempts to connect. A trap in the code to continue
works, but subsequent send() and recv() calls fail in
the same way.
Anybody know how to mask that SIGIO (or whatever signal)?
Setting signal(SIGIO, SIG_IGN) doesn't do anything useful.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
