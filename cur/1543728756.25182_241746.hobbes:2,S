Subject: [PATCH] mtdblockd nofreeze
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

mtdblockd doesn't respond to process freeze requests, preventing system
suspend.  It seems likely that mtdblockd should continue to flush blocks
during the device suspend phase, so a patch to spare the thread from
attempted freeze follows.  If, on the other hand, mtdblockd does need to
implement freeze proper then I can send a patch for that instead, thanks
for any insight into this.
