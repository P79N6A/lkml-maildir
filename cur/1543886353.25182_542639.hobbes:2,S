Yes, the use of a signed comparison is the significant difference.
And yes, the comment becomes wrong.  I'm in the process of redrafting
that.  It currently stands at:
		/* sync IO will cause sync_io to increase before the disk_stats
		 * as sync_io is counted when a request starts, and 
		 * disk_stats is counted when it completes.
		 * So resync activity will cause curr_events to be smaller than
		 * when there was no such activity.
		 * non-sync IO will cause disk_stat to increase without
		 * increasing sync_io so curr_events will (eventually)
		 * be larger than it was before.  Once it becomes
		 * substantially larger, the test below will cause
		 * the array to appear non-idle, and resync will slow
		 * down.
		 * If there is a lot of outstanding resync activity when
		 * we set last_event to curr_events, then all that activity
		 * completing might cause the array to appear non-idle
		 * and resync will be slowed down even though there might
		 * not have been non-resync activity.  This will only
		 * happen once though.  'last_events' will soon reflect
		 * the state where there is little or no outstanding
		 * resync requests, and further resync activity will
		 * always make curr_events less than last_events.
		 *
		 */
Does that read at all well?
