Alexander,
Rather than try to hunt down the oops via the interrupt code I'll try to 
fix the original problem, which is cooked_ioctl incorrectly determines 
the length of the track when an audio CD also contains a data track.  I 
have noticed this bug for a long time (over a year) but only recently 
has it been causing the kernel to crash.  I know this is avoidable by 
using cdda2wav in raw mode but it would be good to fix.
If anybody has any pointers about how I should go about this it would be 
most appriciated.
Many thanks,
Ross
