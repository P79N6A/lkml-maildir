The examples in Documentation/memory-barriers.txt and
Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.tmpl only seem to say that mmiowb
is needed between a writel and a spin_unlock.

Do you mean (b) never makes sense?  (a) is the classic scenario for a
device doing DMA to read a descriptor we've just constructed.

Not at present; readX() have no barrier before the load.  They have a
barrier after the load that waits for the data to arrive before
allowing any following instructions to execute.

Well, it's about ordering between multiple CPUs rather than the write
being "done".  I think the powerpc readX/writeX got to their current
form before the ia64 guys invented mmiowb().
I suspect the best thing at this point is to move the sync in writeX()
before the store, as you suggest, and add an "eieio" before the load
in readX().  That does mean that we are then relying on driver writers
putting in the mmiowb() between a writeX() and a spin_unlock, but at
least that is documented.
Paul.
