Hi. again.
I've taken a look at the comments for your changesets, and our changes
do indeed conflict in a number of places. I'm happy to wait until your
cleanups get included and then merge from there. I've had a brief go at
using BK, but I'm only on a 56K connection, so I'm not sure how
practical it is for me to do pulls etc. I guess for the moment the best
path for me to take might be to continue to port 2.4 and then merge with
you once I'm done.
Regards,
Nigel
