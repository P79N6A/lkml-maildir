That's your choice, and you (and your vendors) will have to
deal with the issues.  I don't see why we should hold back
the development of Linux for it...

On the other hand, not having a feature users need available
in a stable kernel also annoys users and vendors.  During the
2.4 days this lead to every distribution needing to do a bunch
of backports from the 2.5 kernel, and the availability of 2.4
kernels with every possible subset of 2.5 features - but none
with all the features.  Arguably, that is a much worse situation
for users and vendors than a faster-changing 2.6 tree, where at
least everybody is using the same tree.
You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
