Hi Al,
From the sounds of it, you might have an interrupt routing problem. Can
you describe the machine you have this plugged into? Possibly attaching
a copy of "dmesg" and "/proc/interrupts"?
Feel free to attach the driver source to your email if the size is
reasonable (which it sounds like it is.)
As a "big hammer" in case it is an APIC problem, please try booting the
kernel with the "noapic" parameter.
cheers,
	Kyle
