Subject: [PATCHSET] printk: implement printk_header() and merging printk, take #2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, all.
This is the second take of implement-printk_header-and-mprintk
patchset.
  Changes from the last take[L] are...
  * s/mprintk_push/mprintk_add/ and other changes suggested by Randy
    Dunlap.
  * mp->buf instead of mp->header to ease freeing kmalloc'd buffer
    later.
  * mprintk multiline log level handling fixed and improved.  mp->prv is
    removed and mp->flags is used to track whether header log level
    exists and log level is overridden.  One critical bug was re-using
    va_list more than once resulting in dereferences of wrong addresses.
    Fixed by using va_copy().
This patchset aims to make printing multiline messages and assembling
message piece-by-piece easier.
In a nutshell, printk_header() lets you do the following atomically
(against other messages).
 code:
  printk(KERN_INFO "ata1.00: ", "line0\nline1\nline2\n");
 output:
  <6>ata1.00: line0
  <6>         line1
  <6>         line2
And mprintk the following.
 code:
  DEFINE_MPRINTK(mp, 2 * 80);
  mprintk_set_header(&mp, KERN_INFO "ata%u.%2u: ", 1, 0);
  mprintk_push(&mp, "ATA %d", 7);
  mprintk_push(&mp, ", %u sectors\n", 1024);
  mprintk(&mp, "everything seems dandy\n");
 output:
  <6>ata1.00: ATA 7, 1024 sectors
  <6>         everything seems dandy
For more info, please read Documentation/printk.txt which is created
by the fourth patch.

Randy, Jeff, if this take gets acked, how about pushing this through
libata-dev as it's the first user and I have other libata changes
depending on mprintk?
Thanks.
