memory upgrades are rare and tools are available nowdays to resize linux 
partitions.

if you just use the hibernate file as a reserved set of blocks and never 
touch them from the main OS things will work, but if you do anything that 
could put those blocks into the OS write cache all bets are off.

interesting, I didn't know that. I know that the Tivo's use Mac style 
partition tables and they have many partitions (10+). it seems odd that 
when switching from powerpc to x86 that they would lock themselves down 
like that. are you sure that they can't have extended partitions like 
standard PC's? it seems odd that they would have such a special partition 
table type if windows can access it.
