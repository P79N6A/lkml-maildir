Enabling debug would be good. It seems that the driver has protection around 
most of the really low level debugging with:
#if VERBOSE > SHOW_ERROR_MESSAGES
...
If this test passes, a silly DEBUG() wrapper is used to determine whether the 
message should be printed:
islpci_mgt.h:#define DEBUG(f, args...) K_DEBUG(f, pc_debug, args)
islpci_mgt.h:#define K_DEBUG(f, m, args...) \
	do { \
		if(f & m) printk(KERN_DEBUG args); \
	} while(0)
Currently the driver has:
islpci_mgt.h:#define VERBOSE                                 0x01
islpci_mgt.h:#define SHOW_ERROR_MESSAGES                     0x01
So I think you'll need to:
a) Hack islpci_mgt.h and change VERBOSE to 0x02 (or any number higher).
b) Insert the module with pc_debug=1
Then you should get debugging messages, since (0x01 & 0x01) will trigger the 
debugging.
