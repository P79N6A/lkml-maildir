Sorry folx for the question. I *do* read this group diagonally and I
could not find out if 2.2.10-ac is a step towards a probably 2.2.11 or
a step aside. I mean, are 2.2.10-ac changes going to be committed to
some 2.2.11 someday (then I can wait for that day) or not.
Reason why I ask: I have no problems whatsoever with 2.2.10 but if I
look at the Changes for 2.2.10-ac I must say that it contains neat
stuff from neat people so I wonder if I should jump on it now
(provided it would never make it into a 2.2.11).
Thanks.
