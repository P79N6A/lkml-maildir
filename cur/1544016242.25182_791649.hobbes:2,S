Please.  A lack of thorough documentation, while it should be fixed, does 
not imply that a feature is not being used.

There are global system-wide oom conditions, cpuset-constrained oom 
conditions, memory controller oom conditions, and mempolicy oom 
conditions.  You're patch affects them all, yet it is quite possible that 
killing oom_victim_name will not alleviate the oom condition in a disjoint 
cpuset.  It would have been needlessly killed because you make no 
distinction on the constraint of the oom.

Being ignorant about cpusets doesn't justify you breaking their oom 
handling.
