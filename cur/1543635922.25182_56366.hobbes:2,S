Did I request this? No, definitely not. Hoewver, it helps a lot
if a GUI for cdrecord may use cdrecord to find potential drives
and if there is a unique addressing scheme.
BTW: did you ever look at Solaris / HP-UX, ... and the way they
name disks?
someting like: /dev/{r}dsk/c0t0d0s0
This is SCSI bus, target, lun and slice.

It is not a fault of cdrecord either.
