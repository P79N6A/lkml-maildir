Maybe you should take issue with the people applying random patches, missing
important ones and mixing and matching incompatible ideas in the main tree ?
The VM tuning in the -ac tree is a lot more reliable for most loads (its
certainly not perfect) and that is because the changes have been done and
tested one at a time as they are merged. Real engineering process is the
only way to get this sort of thing working well.
