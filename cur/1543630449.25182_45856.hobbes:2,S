Hmm. There is something else that smells in the above, since the XOR operator
doesn't seem to be proper. Why shouldn't we get DRQ_STAT at all on short
request? Could you perhaps just try to replace it with an OR?
Thinking about the kernel hang and SCSI - I would have to ask whatever there
is really interrupt sharing between IDE and SCSI. If the hangs happen due to
the usage of ide-scsi then I already know what's going - ide-scsi doesn't
do proper locking on command submission to the ATA layer.
