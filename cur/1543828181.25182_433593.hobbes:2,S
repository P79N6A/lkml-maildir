(a)
  come with something up like glibc's compatibility scheme for high device 
  numbers, ie.
    minor = ((ubdisk & 0x1F)  << 4) | (ubpart & 0x03) |
            ((ubdisk & ~0x1F) << 9) | ((ubpart & 0x08) << 8)
  bits 10 09 08 | 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
  old              d  d  d  d  d  p  p  p
  new ..d  d  p |  d  d  d  d  d  p  p  p
  Would give the usual 16 partitions. But see (b).
(b)
  "181 block" seems free.
  Suggestion: have block-major-180 be ub disks with 8 parts max (and marked 
  as deprecated)
  and block-major-181 be ub disks with 16 parts max
