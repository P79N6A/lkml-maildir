Fork eventually failing is very reasonable if you're executing a fork
loop.

Please try with 2.4.23aa3, I think there was some oom killer change
after I had no resources to track 2.4 anymore. I'm not saying 2.4.23aa3
will work better though, but I would like to know if there's some corner
case still open in 2.4-aa. Careful, 2.4.23aa3 has security bugs (only
local security of course, i.e. normally not a big issue, sure good
enough for a quick test).
I doubt your testcase simulates anything remotely realistic but
anyway it's still informative.
What I'm simulating here is very real life scenario with a couple of
apps allocating more memory than ram.

Was the oom killer invoked at all? If yes, and it works with preempt,
that could mean a cond_resched is simply missing...

yes.

That's trivial to fix checking for PF_DEAD/PF_EXITING.

The callback adds overhead to the exit path. Plus strictly speaking it's
not actually a callback, you're just "polling" for the bitflag :)

You can get an I/O race where your program is about to finish a failing
try_to_free_pages pass (note that a task exiting won't make
try_to_free_pages work any easier, try_to_free_pages has to free
allocated memory, it doesn't care if there's 1M or 100M of free memory).
If you don't check the watermarks after waiting for I/O, you're going to
generate a suprious oom-killing. Your changes can't help.
Note that even the watermark checks leaves a race window open, but at
least it's not an I/O window. While try_to_free_pages can wait for I/O
and then fail.
I'll add to my last patch the removal of the PF_MEMDIE check in oom_kill
plus I'll fix the remaining race with PF_EXITING/DEAD, and I'll add a
cond_resched. Then you can try again with my simple way (w/ and w/o
PREEMPT ;).
Thanks for the great feedback.
