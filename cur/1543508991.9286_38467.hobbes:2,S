Dumb question -- where can I get the ikd patch?  I could put it on the 
Dell (the most repeatable crash) and see if I could find the problem.
One of the Penguins (dual PIII) is running under load over the weekend
on 2.2.11 (yes, I went backwards, but I did not have any crashes with
2.2.11).  I'll let you know how well it does Monday AM.

My guess is 3 - a lock bug.  Based on the fact that the Dell locks up
with the floppy and the others with NFS/network -- it could be in
multiple
places (same code copied maybe)?
I've been at kid's soccer, piano, etc. today and won't be able to do 
any tests until Monday -- the computers that are having problems are
at work.  If you have any luck, please  let me know!
