3 months ago i verified the published kevent vs. epoll benchmark and 
found that benchmark to be fatally flawed. When i redid it properly 
kevent showed no significant advantage over epoll. Note that i did those 
measurements _before_ the recent round of epoll speedups. So unless 
someone does believable benchmarks i consider kevent an over-hyped, 
mis-benchmarked complication to do something that epoll is perfectly 
capable of doing.
