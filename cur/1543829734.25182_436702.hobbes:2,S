No, the inevitable flame war here is the abusive way of telling people 
not to extract the kernel sources as root.  This argument boils down to 
a fundamental disjunct: trust people to handle security of their own box 
their own way, with full knowledge of how their tools work, or assume 
that they aren't intelligent enough to use tools sanely and securely, 
and handicap so they don't have to.  The latter, much as it is not seen 
this way, is the abusive philosophy.  The former trusts the user.
Yes, there's a learning curve.  There is always a learning curve.  Never 
expect there not to be a learning curve.
The kernel archive is foremost an archive of a working directory.  The 
recommended workflow is sane, and is designed around the limitations of 
tools sensibly designed for a wide range of purposes, not foremost of 
which is kernel compilation.
Please learn to take advice.  It tends to be intended for your benefit, 
and is generally more useful when not viewed as a personal affront.
