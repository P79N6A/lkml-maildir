I hate to ask this, however here goes.  I am doing some remote upgrading 
and some other really funky stuff to some boxes I keep up.
Part of these are total system upgrades and I need to move data out of 
the way while still having a working box.  I decided that cramfs may be 
the way to do this.  If you can tell me no and point me to a resource on 
how to do this, I would LOVE to hear about it.
However, the question is, how can I tell lilo to tell the kernel too 
boot off a cramfs file system?  I have already created the file with 
/etc /bin /sbin /dev and /lib from a working system, doing the correct 
deletions and other such changes.  I have a 15 meg cramfs that should do 
the trick.
Thank you for any help you can offer.
