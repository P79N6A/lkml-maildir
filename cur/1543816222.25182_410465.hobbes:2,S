Cleanup? Something that changes behaviour is not cleanup.

Threads like kswapd do not have a fully loaded sleep_avg.

Very few kernel threads should require RT just to work as you just said, yet 
you'll make it harder for them with your changed dynamic priority semantics. 
We already know they are not going to be misbehaving userspace tasks and they 
deserve simpler semantics than the full interactivity estimator gives.

Which?

Trouble occurs months afterwards this hits mainline since you'll get almost 
noone testing it in -mm. It was put there because it hurt interactivity and 
you're removing it because you don't like that we have to put a special case 
there?

And what does it actually achieve making this change is my question? 
I feel this discussion may degenerate beyond this point. Should we say to 
agree to disagree at this point? I don't like these changes.
