Ah timers, timers, timers...
Agree.  We should also not export timer_synchronize(), as it is only
useful/meaningful/safe when used under timerlist_lock, or when used on a
non-reinstalling timer.  The subtleties of this probably mean that if
someone tried to use timer_synchronize() they'd get it wrong :(  I'd
like to see the following interface:
del_timer_async()   -> delete a timer, may still be running
del_timer_sync()    -> delete a timer, may deadlock
del_timer()         -> Legacy, deprecated async deletion
and _nothing_ else.
The test3-pre2 timer code was written by Linus.  I had a couple of
issues with it and sent him the attached patch which I believe improves
things - faster, smaller, cleaner.
The main issue I have with the sequence number algorithm is that many
timers in the kernel are _not_ initialised with init_timer() - they're
simply wiped to all zeroes.  So if someone does a del_timer_sync() on
one of these when timer_sequence is equal to zero, the machine will
hang.
Also, I think timer_sequence (should it continue to exist) should be
moved inside CONFIG_SMP.
Anyway, I suggest we wait and see what test3-pre3 brings us, then seek a
narrower interface - move most of this stuff into timer.c--- linux-2.4.0-test3-pre2/kernel/timer.c	Fri Jun 30 18:05:27 2000
