You are right.
I can't remember for sure. I tried it some months ago and I will not repeat
it, becaused it messed up my Windows configuration which took a while to
get it back without reinstallation...
If I think about it, the same happened what I got when I tried to load the
old ne module with complete io and irq parameters: the kernel says, that
the ressource is not available. So, disabling 'irq steering' wouldn't be a
solution anyway, as long as I cannot restore the io settings.

I'm looking forward to it.

I don't have experience in kernel programming. I simply tried to cat
/proc/bus/00/09.0 (which is the information of my netcard) into a file and
I then to cat it back. bang. *G* The kernel was gone without any chance to
get it back - but it was my fault. I'm going to think about a DOS program
(or find one in the Internet).
