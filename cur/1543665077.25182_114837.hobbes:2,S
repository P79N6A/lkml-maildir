This is getting kicked like a deadhorse by now i think but.
Unlike your cpu which gets idle commands from the OS and thus has an 
idle loop where it turns off certain circuits and which can get acpi 
commands to turn completely off the other chips in the computer do not 
have such a luxury. they are always on like the cpus of yesteryear used 
to be.  It doesn't matter if they have data moving in them or not, no 
big difference.  The reason why it seems like this is the case is for 
you HSF cooled cpu guys, load on the system bus usually means high cpu 
load and that means more heat put into the surrounding air and the 
little usually passive cooled but regardless, less hot system bus gets 
hotter along with the cpu and cooler when the cpu is idle.   People 
cooled by other methods that do not dump heat into the surrounding air 
inside the case will notice that the system bus temp only varies with 
ambient air temp changes, not data transfer going on between ram and cpu.
