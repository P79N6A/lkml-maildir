In 2.5 (and soon 2.4), the crypto/deflate.c module makes use of zlib as
well.  This is typically used in ipsec for ipcomp.  Each ipcomp security
association has a zlib context, and access to the workspace is serialized 
by the security association's bh lock.
(Something needs to be done for this particular case in general: a box
with 1000 tunnels could use use 450MB of atomic kernel memory just for
zlib workspaces alone.  A solution I've been looking at for this is to
allow workspaces to be dynamically sized based on the compression
parameters instead of using worst-case figures.  The memory savings may be
up to 90% in this case).

This won't work for the bh lock protected case outlined above, and will
cause contention between different users of zlib.
