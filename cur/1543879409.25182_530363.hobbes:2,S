Ooh, you wanted a _runtime_ mapping of flags, yeah then I guess that works.
Still seems like a basically hit and miss affair to just use flags. What if
you want to know the process mapping a page? With systemtap or something you
could walk the rmap structures. What if you want to look at pages along the
LRU list rather than per-pfn? What about connecting pages to inodes?
I thought this type of deep poking was the whole reason the probles thingies
were merged. I'm saddened that they're no good for this. I thought it would
be an ideal usage :(

Yeah it is close, they need page_mapcount I think. But I was going to say
that satisfying an Oracle requirement is a good reason _not_ to merge it ;)
(I joke!)
