Hello Maxi,
That may be true for your Laptop, but it unfortunately isn't true for my ASUS 
mainboard onboard controller.
Unfortunately I cannot confirm this:
My broadcom 4401 driver is not part of a notebook, but instead part of an ASUS 
P4PE mainboard.
At my second attempt I went the conventional path (i. e. ignoring the fact 
that
"Broadcom 4400 ethernet support appears twice in section "Network device 
support":
Whether you leave out "EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers" or not it 
simply appears twice in kernel config! This is bug number 1.
Conventional path means:
EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers Y
Broadcom 4400 ethernet support m
Broadcom 4400 PCI device support Y
This configuration binds:
Sonics Silicon Backplane Support m
Support for SSB on PCI-bus host
SSB PCI core driver
This time I do get a "good" interrupt: IRQ 21 for the the device.
BUT:
Trying to ping another machine fails saying:
"destination host unreachable"
That means, Although the interrupt is fine now, the device is still not 
functionable.
This is bug number 2.
Cheers
Uwe
P. S.: Michael, Andrew, if you need additional information to resolve that 
issue please tell / ask me.
