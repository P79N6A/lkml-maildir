Changes in rate does not sound good. It's possibly what's screwing up
my paravirt clock implementation in smp.
Since the host updates guest time prior to putting vcpu to run, two
vcpus that start running at different times will have different system
values.
Now if the vcpu that started running later probes the time first,
we'll se the time going backwards. A constant tsc rate is the only way
around
my limited mind sees around the problem (besides, obviously, _not_
making the system time per-vcpu).
