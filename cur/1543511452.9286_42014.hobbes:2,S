Subject: System reboot from user space without calling motifier_call_chain ?

Is there a way to force a reboot on a system that is otherwise finding
itself blocking on reboot() ?  I have a system that has a broken raid array
that won't ever get past the notifier_call_chain ( SYS_RESTART ) list.  The
machine is co-located, and it's hard for me to get a human to reboot it.
Ideally, I'd like to be able to call machine_restart() directly... can I
duplicate it's functionality in user space?
