SMP actually makes no difference. I have full SMP APM working on my test
boxes now. However pre-empt and SMP are the same problem space

Yes. APM calls are made by all sorts of processes.

Which does mean you can steal the old TLS value and put it back across
the calls just by changing the TLS data for that process. For that
matter on Windows emulation I thought Windows also needed 0x40 to be the
same offset as the BIOS does so can't we leave it hardwired ?
