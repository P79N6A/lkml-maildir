yeah - and false positives also tend to create apathy and resistence 
against kernel warnings - thus drawing tester resources away from more 
important bugs.

ok. In this case i'd suggest we should just remove the warning. People do 
get scared by needless kernel stack dumps - no matter whether it's marked 
informational or not.
So how about the patch below, queued up in tip/x86/debug? Arjan, what do 
you think?

Subject: [PATCH] IO resources, x86: remove multi-BAR mapping sanity check
Impact: remove a debug warning
The ioremap() time multi-BAR map warning has been causing false positives:
 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/10/432
 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/11/136
So remove it for now.
