They shouldn't do - GCC should realise that code like:
	int this_cpu = 0;
	array_access[this_cpu].foo = 0;
	array_access[this_cpu].bar = 1;
can be optimised.  So long as "this_cpu" remains an auto variable, then
it should be ok.

We relied on it before, so why can't we rely on it again?

There's no argument there.  Its only that it can be improved further
with very little effort.
