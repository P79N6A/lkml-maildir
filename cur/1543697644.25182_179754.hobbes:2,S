There's some kind of shenanigan going on with cpucount I can't be arsed
to decipher where it's incremented and decremented all over the place;
do_boot_cpu() returns status, so counting successes got the bug fixed.
Fixing max_cpus > NR_CPUS has some kind of core impact. So I've pretty
much punted on both killing kicked and fixing max_cpus. I anticipate
a particular someone I don't want to hear from complaining loudly.
Maybe something like the below (untested) would be helpful.
-- wli
Propagate kicked down to do_boot_cpu() and nuke the redundant cpucount.
The choice of which to nuke was based on cpucount being modified all
over the place and actually being 1 less than all cpus, vs. kicked being
a counter maintained all in one place and actually representing the
total number of cpus. Old semantics are AFAICT preserved apart from
terminating the wakeup loop at kicked < max(NR_CPUS, max_cpus), which is
actually a darn good idea since there's no reason to fiddle with the
rest of the APIC ID space once we've got all the cpus we're allowed to.
