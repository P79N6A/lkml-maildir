I wasn't precise... 
There are ++ and -- for the file descriptors approach
++)
(a) it automatically cleans up the notify queue associated with the FD.
     [ notify queue could still be global, if we want that ]
     when the process disappears, no callback required in do_exit()
--) There is more overhead in the wakeup and the wait because I need to 
     move from the fd to the filestruct which is always some lookup and
     I have to verify that the file descriptor is actually a valid /dev/futex
     file (yikes).    
Another problem I see is that we only have one additional 
argument (void *utime) to piggyback the fd and the signal on. 
What could be done is the following.
Make utime a (void *utime) argument
In FUTEX_WAIT   interpret it as a pointer <struct timespec>
In FUTEX_AWAIT  inteprest it as { short fd, short sig };
There should be no limitation by casting it to shorts ?
Comments, anyone....
I suggest, we leave it as is right now until more comments come.
