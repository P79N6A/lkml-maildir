Hi!
I compiled kernel 2.6.24-rc1 (latest git as of today) on a Box with 256MB Ram.
During "make modules_install" I got these errors:
  DEPMOD  2.6.24-rc1-default
WARNING: Can't read 
module /lib/modules/2.6.24-rc1-default/kernel/net/bridge/bridge.ko: Cannot 
allocate memory
WARNING: Can't read 
module /lib/modules/2.6.24-rc1-default/kernel/net/bridge/netfilter/ebt_redirect.ko: 
Cannot allocate memory
[...]
FATAL: Memory allocation failure depmod.c line 158: realloc(mod->deps, 
sizeof(mod->deps[0])*(mod->num_deps+1)).
make: *** [_modinst_post] Fehler 1
Depmod used too much memory and exits. Tried a 2nd time and checked with top.
IMHO this is a regression.
best regards
jan-simon
