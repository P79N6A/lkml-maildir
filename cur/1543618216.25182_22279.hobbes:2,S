Thanks. In between I tested the patch and it works but seems to have a 
painful side effect. Using the patch I can now mount more than 256 NFS 
filesystems on the patched host.
The trouble is, that no other machine can NFS mount anything from this 
patched machine. This is because nfsd cannot be started any longer (kernel 
nfsd) on the patches server. When I try to start rpc.nfsd on this patched 
host you see the following in /var/log/messages:
portmap: connect from 127.0.0.1 to set(nfs): request from unprivileged port
rpc.nfsd: nfssvc: error Permission denied
A strace of nfsd shows the problem:
...
nfsservctl(0, 0xbfffeed8, 0) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
...
Anyone know how this can be fixed?
Thanks Rainer
