Oh, and the reason your patch turned up incorrect in my mailer and on
lkml seems to be the PGP signature.  I didn't have your public key, so
my mail client just left the full PGP-signed text in, which includes
escaping of '-' characters.  LKML must also ignore the signature.  Once
I added your public key, the patch shows up correctly in my client at least.
(I guess everyone else probably knew this already...but at least I
learned something new today)
