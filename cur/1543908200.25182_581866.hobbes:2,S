I think perhaps you misunderstand what Eric is doing.
sys_sysctl() isn't working properly for these cases and it is both a
deprecated interface and not worth the pain of adding support
in these cases.
The fact that nobody complains that none of this stuff works
via sys_sysctl() to me proves that it is never used.
