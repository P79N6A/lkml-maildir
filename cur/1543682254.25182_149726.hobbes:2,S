Fear ye not the perils of dselect and associated evils.
Though it is, admittedly, one of the most user-malevolent tools known to
man, with a UI designed by sadistic perverts from the very bowels of this
earth, you don't need to use it to run debian (I never do). apt will do
everything you need to do.
But, leaving aside for a moment, the holy crusade of righteousness ...
----------------------
NAME
       deb - Debian binary package format
SYNOPSIS
       filename.deb
...
FORMAT
       The  file is an ar archive with a magic number of !<arch>.
-----------------------
So it should be pretty easy to rip what you want out of there. If that
doesn't work, I'll make you a tarball ;-)
