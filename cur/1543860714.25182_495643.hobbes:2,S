Not for everything, only for the trampoline between the client interface
environment and the kernel. But yeah, we haven't tried hard to go in
that direction at all.

Not that true anymore. A lot of driver probe is being threaded nowadays,
either bcs of the new multithread probing bits, or because they get
loaded by userland from some initramfs etc..

You can maybe create an in-memory cache of all properties in a node from
whatever function that returns a node pointer and dispose of them on
_put(), that would allow to keep the get_property semantics as-is with a
"live" tree, but I still don't see the point
