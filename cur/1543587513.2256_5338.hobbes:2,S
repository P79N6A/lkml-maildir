Hi,
Any particular reasons why a stock 2.4.3 kernel doesn't have mm.h and
pgalloc.h in sync on Alpha. This is what I get :
# make boot
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/redhat/linux/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev5 -Wa,-mev6   -c -o init/main.o
init/main.c

2.4.1 compiled fine, and as far as I can see, some changes has been made
to mm.h since then. I think these changes was followed up by i386, ppc,
s390 and sparc64 kernels but not on others. Any plans on when this is
done ?
Best regards,
