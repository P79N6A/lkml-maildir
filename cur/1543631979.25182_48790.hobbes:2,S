I contemplate them in zen peace and they speak to me 8). The MCE value
is the flags from the control register. The Bank n value is a dump of
the register that explains what the fault is. The decoding rules are in
the Intel Pentium III documentation set.

Is the fact the airbag deployed a good indication that it will deploy if
you keep crashing into walls ? Its logging a CPU error where it decides
the CPU is in an unrecoverable state. The odds are pretty good but each
time you are taking the risk it won't, and if its a hardware problem
that it might simply drop dead for good.
