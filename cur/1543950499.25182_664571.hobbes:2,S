2.6.25-rc4 invokes the oom-killer repeatedly when attempting to boot,
eventually panicing with "Out of memory and no killable processes."
This happens since at least 2.6.25-rc3, but 2.6.24 boots just fine,
The system is a Dell Inspiron E1705 running Fedora 8 (x86_64).
My .config is at 
http://tuxrocks.com/tmp/config-2.6.25-rc4,
 and a syslog
of the system up until the point where it oom-killed syslog (just before
the panic) is at 
http://tuxrocks.com/tmp/oom-2.6.25-rc4.txt
