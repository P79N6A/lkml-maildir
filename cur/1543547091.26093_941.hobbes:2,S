Subject: 2.4.0-test7 lockup

I'm seeing a hard lockup under 2.4.0-test7.  The good news is that it's
100% reproducible... all I have to do is attempt to install
gpm_1.19.3-3.deb from Debian unstable (interestingly, no other package
seems to trigger the problem).  The bad news is that I have no idea
what the problem is.
The kernel is just a stock 2.4.0-test7 (i.e. no patches have been
applied).  I've attached the output from ksymoops, as well as the
config.  System information:
     Motherboard: Supermicro PIIIDME (i840 based)
     CPU:         Dual PIII 600MHz
     RAM:         512MB SDRAM
     SCSI:        Adaptec 2940UW
If there are any missing details I need to fill in, please let me know. 
Thanx!
ksymoops 2.3.4 on i686 2.4.0-test7.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.0-test7/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.4.0-test7 (specified)
