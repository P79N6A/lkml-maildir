I wouldn't be surprised if windows did it from day 1.
Windows started out as a program loader and a somewhat graphical shell. I
think people forget the early trials, ie before Win-3.0, which ended up
mostly running DOS programs. With a timer frequency of 18.2Hz or something
like that.
So I wouldn't be surprised if Win-1.0 used to switch between different 
frequencies..
