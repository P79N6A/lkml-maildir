Yes.  MTAs have to work around this; qmail does a reasonable job.  Why
not look at how djb does this?  See ipme.c.

Having an MTA automatically treat clients on "local subnets" differently
than the rest of the 'net at large is definitely _not_ desirable.  The
administrator should have to explicitly configure the MTA to grant
additional access to every subnet he desires; anything else is begging
for trouble in the form of absued relaying privileges.
