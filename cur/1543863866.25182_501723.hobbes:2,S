Err, replace /enabled/disabled/ in my reply above.
The problem with your patch is that it breaks the structure newly
introduced.  In the new tree, card* contains the whole belonging
devices, and each device points to the one in the card object.
Passing dev->parent there cuts the relation between the card object
and each device.
That's why my patch rules out setting card->dev with ifdef
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED.  As fallback, it takes the parent device to
build the old style tree.

Yes, it's a new stuff.
