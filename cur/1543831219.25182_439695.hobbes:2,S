The reason I say "never" is because it would either require moving
alsa-lib into the kernel (long ago rejected), or devising some system to
redirect operations on /dev/dsp back into userspace to alsa-lib.  It
seems insane for the audio path to be
userspace->kernel->userspace->kernel and I'm pretty sure this idea was
also rejected a while back.
