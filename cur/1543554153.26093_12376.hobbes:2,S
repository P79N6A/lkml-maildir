Bingo! Thanks very much for spotting this... yup, looks like the cobalt
box was at fault all along, and the clients that 'worked' were indeed
ignoring the timestamping.
The cobalt machines have now had a kernel upgrade (only to 2.2.14, thats
the most recent that Cobalt provide...), and the problem has
disappeared.
Thanks once more,
Ben
