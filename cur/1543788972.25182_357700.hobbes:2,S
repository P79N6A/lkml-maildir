The kernel sources for N770 will be available in www.maemo.org when we
start sales. There will be some binary modules that will not be made
open source. All drivers we can open source, we will, and they will be
pushed to linux-omap tree and into mainstream kernel through driver
specific channels. Unfortunately all open source drivers are not yet in
linux-omap tree so you cannot compile your own kernel for N770, I'm
sorry about that.
