I have to agree with Christoph on that.  I don't think reusing an existing
timer is going to work in most of the cases - in many cases there isn't an
existing timer to reuse, and even if there is, it's usually there for some
other purpose.

I'm not so sure of that.  Currently the rest of the kernel is unaware there's a
timer there and doesn't have to do anything about it directly.

It's pretty straightforward as it is now.  The worst bit is that we have to
have several functions that do the same or a similar thing but with different
names because they take different arguments.
The benefit of what we have at the moment is that there is only one timer
callback routine required and everything uses that - not that we can't just
export that, but it's cleaner to set things up since the rest of the kernel
doesn't know there's a timer involved.
