Subject: [announce] mountlo 0.1 - loopback mounting in userspace

This program works similarly to "mount -o loop", but the filesystem
runs in userspace, making it possible for non-root users to safely
loopback mount filesystem images.
It works by starting a UML (User Mode Linux) instance, mounting the
image in there, and exporting the resulting data through FUSE. 
This is a first release and is really stupid: you can't even specify
the filesystem type or any mount options.  But for filesystems that
mount can recognize it works fine.
A binary compiled for i386 is available (2.1M) [1]. Requirements for
running the binary are:
  o FUSE-2.2 or greater, or kernel module from recent -mm kernel
  o Any Linux version supported by the above (>= 2.4.21 basically)
To compile from source, the following components are needed:
  o Linux 2.6.11 kernel source  (35M)  [2]
  o FUSE 2.3-pre4 source        (350k) [3]
  o mountlo 0.1 source          (15k)  [4]
Mount time is about 0.5 sec, which is ghastly compared to native
kernel mount, but not so bad considering, that a complete kernel boot
with initramfs unpacking, etc. is in there.  Other than this I haven't
done any performance measurements.
Comments, patches, offers to take over maintenance are welcome ;)
