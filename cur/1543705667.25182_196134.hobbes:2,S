In general it's important for Linux to be able to reset a device 
reliable.  Where in Other Operating Systems one must reboot the 
computer, Linux users can just re-load the driver quite often.
So I think there are two comments here:
* I can certainly see -probing- being unreliable (but not necessarily reset)
* If the default state for some devices is power-down, the driver should 
be aware of that -anyway-, and we should power up on startup or on-demand.
