From include/linux/version.h:
---------------------------------------------------------------
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.5.67-bk2"
#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132419
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
---------------------------------------------------------------
Your changes will definitely break things that do:
#if ((LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2.4.0)) && \
     (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2.5.0)))
Also, most docs explaining the version format, refer to
  major.minor.micro
Anyhow, I did not say it was set in stone, I just said if you
start getting breakage when compiling/configuring things, do
not wonder why =)
