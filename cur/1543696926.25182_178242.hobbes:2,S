No. The fundamental point is:
	There are a small group of people who cannot legally extract sources from o/s 
projects hosted with bk. However small the group, this is unacceptible for an 
o/s project.
So Bk is unsuitable for general hosting of o/s, 'free and available to all' 
projects. They will use cvs or arch.
Thats why you should provide this facility. Not because I want it, but because 
you should want as many o/s projects as possible to use bk, for sound 
business reasons.
I think I can see granny looking hungrily at a basket of eggs, so I'm 
finished.
