Yes it would be Ingo, but so far, none of the recent -rt patches has 
booted on this machine, the last one I tried a few days ago failing to 
find /dev/root, whatever the heck that is.
FWIW, I gave up on the rt stuffs 6 months or more ago when the regressions 
I was reporting weren't ever acknowledged.  I don't enjoy sitting through 
all these e2fsk's during the reboot just to have things I normally run in 
the background die, like tvtime, sitting there with some news channel 
muttering along in the background.  I was even ignored when I suggested 
it might be a dma problem, which I still think it could be.
Nevertheless, the patch you sent is building as I type, intermittently 
when the screen deigns to update so I can fix the spelling etc.

And I'd wager a cool one that you don't gain more than a second or so in 
compile time between a make -j8 and a make -j200 unless your network is a 
pair of tomato juice cans & some string.  Again, to me, the network thing 
is not something that's present in an everyday users environment.  My 
drives are all here and now, on pata-133 interfaces.
