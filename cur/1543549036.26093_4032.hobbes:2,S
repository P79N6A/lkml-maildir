[snip examples]
Indeed, it's obvious that your code will give better
results (and it's more readable too). I like it...

This is a very very big problem, which definately needs
to be addressed ASAP. I've witnessed this starvation happen
a couple of times and it's a really big problem...

Well DUH. ;)
A disk seek takes ~10 milliseconds on a modern drive,
that's about an /eternity/ as far as the CPU is concerned.
Anyone who thinks saving on CPU time is worth it for
something as critical to disk seeks as the elevator code
should be locked up inside a microVAX ;)
