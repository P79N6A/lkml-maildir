Yes, I know the difference. The reason for this post was not blind
curiosity but the presumption that the great performance increase of 
2.4.14p8 we reported was mainly due to the PAE enabling in the 2.4.7 and 
non-PAE-enabling 2.4.14p8 in our first test.
The tests above show that this is not the case. Even with PAE 2.4.14 is
faster by an order of magnitude.
The other info we did find interesting is the actual amount of 
difference between PAE and nonPAE. The 6% we got fit very well in some
estimates I found on lkml.
