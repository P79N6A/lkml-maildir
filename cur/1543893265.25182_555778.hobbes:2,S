Good stuff!

Yeah, I don't see any "parition table" messages there,
so it must've hung on the I/O somehow.
Bummer, but it was worth trying, I suppose.

That's probably some weird interaction with the simple polling patch,
so I think we can disregard it, unless it pops up again someday on
an unpatched kernel.
Well, at this point, I think the only way to make progress is for one of
the IDE/libata gurus to actually get hold of the same card you have,
meaning Alan Cox (best choice), or myself, or Bart.  Or maybe Tejun.
Without that, this isn't likely to improve much.  
Cheers
