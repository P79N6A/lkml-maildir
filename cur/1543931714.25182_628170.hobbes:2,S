JFYI: My message bounced back:
<ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>: host cs.sunysb.edu[130.245.1.15] said: 550 5.7.1 Access
    denied (in reply to MAIL FROM command)
(stupid anti-spam policy @sunysb.edu, it seems - refusing
to accept *.ru as sender address, no matter if the mail
was sent to, say, postmaster@, asking about delivery
problems...  Oh well.)
Please excuse me for cluttering up the lists.
