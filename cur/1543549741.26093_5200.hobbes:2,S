An important exception in 2.2/2.4 is NFS with bigger rsize (will be fixed
in 2.5, but 2.4 does it this way). For an 8K r/wsize you need reliable 
(=GFP_ATOMIC) 16K allocations.  
Another thing I would worry about are ports with multiple user page sizes in 2.5.
Another ugly case is the x86-64 port which has 4K pages but may likely need
a 16K kernel stack due to the 64bit stack bloat.
