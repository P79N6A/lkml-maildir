Also note that it's just a convenience feature. In other words it's not that with this patch
we'll never route IRQs to those CPUs. They can still be explicitly routed by writing to 
irq/N/smp_affitnity.

No no no. That's what I though too ;-). The problem is that things like NFS and friends
expect _all_ their workqueue threads to report back when they do certain things like
flushing buffers and stuff. The reason I added this is because my machines were getting
stuck because CPU0 was waiting for CPU1 to run NFS work queue threads even though no IRQs
or other things are running on it.

I agree in general. The thing is though that stop machine just kills any kind of latency 
guaranties. Without the patch the machine just hangs waiting for the stop-machine to run
when module is inserted/removed. And running without dynamic module loading is not very 
practical on general purpose machines. So I'd rather have an option with a big red warning 
than no option at all :).
Thanx
