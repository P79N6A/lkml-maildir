Hi,
recently I was on the internet with kernel 2.4.0-prerelease.
Suddenly Netscape hung and I couldn't help hard rebooting.
Fsck discovered an error it wasn't able to fix. This error never
appeared before and my Seagate HD actually should be alright.
The following error message appears everytime I check /dev/hda3
and when I tries to access the blocks involved in this error.
Now here it is:
--------------snip---------------------
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekCompleteError }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError } LBAsect = 2421754, sector
210048
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 2100448
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekCompleteError }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError } LBAsect = 2421754, sector
210048
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 2100448
Error reading block 262556 (Attempt to read block from filesystem resultet
in
short read) while doing inode scan. Ignore error <y>?
----------------snip---------------------
badblocks found about 44 bad blocks.
So I really want to know how to get rid of this error.
Is it a hardware error ( well at least I don't think so )?
Is it correctable with some special tricks ?
Would reformating solve the error.
My system configuration is:
Duron 700, Biostar mainboard, 128 MB, 30 GB Seagate ST-330630A
Any help is appreciated
TIA
P.S.: I am not in the list so please also CC directly to my e-mail
address, THX.
