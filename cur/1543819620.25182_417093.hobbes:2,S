However such application may exist in the future (which is why the feature
was implemented, i guess). If AppArmor becomes widespread in the future
(well suse has it anyway so it's already quite widespread) it won't be easy
to  create succesful apps which play with namespaces, not to speak that it
won't be possible to "securize" such apps. From my user POV it seems
really weird that a feature forbids you from using another unrelated feature.
