Changes:
- updated to 2.6.11 (added asm-frv)
- some minor fixes
The server hosting my page was down for a week or so. I don't provide any 
official mirrors, but you can get llh from anywhere (gazillions of 
LinuxFromScrach mirrors for example). I believe that should be enough 
(right?).
I bet somebody will ask what's with llh's vs. kernel's 2.6.x.y versioning, but 
let's just assume people can figure it out for themselves (iow -- I'll wait 
for the first actual question before I update llh's FAQ).
Happy hacking.
