Frankly, I did not audit any of the RPC-based services to see if any
truly cared about the node name. That's actually a rather large scope
when you consider it -- I'd have to look at much more than just "Linux"
RPC clients. It seemed unsafe to assume _nobody_ would care after they
bothered to put it into the spec.
Hopefully I'm wrong though :).
