i guess i'm confused then.  what good does this change do:
2.2.5 pagemap.h:
#define i (((unsigned long) inode)/(sizeof(struct inode) &
~ (sizeof(struct inode) - 1)))
#define o (offset >> PAGE_SHIFT)
#define s(x) ((x)+((x)>>PAGE_HASH_BITS))
	return s(i+o) & (PAGE_HASH_SIZE-1);
2.2.5-arca pagemap.h:
	return s(i+o+offset) & (PAGE_HASH_SIZE-1);
                    ^^^^^^^
btw, do you know if there is a special reason why PAGE_HASH_BITS is 11?
