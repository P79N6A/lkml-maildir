Sean,
Not so simple.
How does client application knows where to connect?
Does this proposal forces applications to choose
the "right" network?
Currently, MPA or ULP and not applications handle it.
Why would we want to change that?
Sean,
I may be beating the dead horse,
but I recall that one of the main selling points
of RDMA that it magical bust to performance with
no changes applications. Just plug it in an viola,
performances goes up and CPU utilization for network
stack goes does. Win-Win.
Thanks,
