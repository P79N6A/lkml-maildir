Sounds great!

I don't know.  I have been mulling over in my head for quite a while what 
to do about an interface for "advanced ntfs features" but so far I have 
always pushed this to the back of my mind.  After all no point in 
providing advanced features considering we don't even provide full 
read-write access yet.  I just thought I would mentione NTFS when I saw 
your post.
But to answer your question I definitely would envisage an interface to 
the kernel driver rather than to libntfs.  It is 'just' a matter of 
deciding how that would look...
Partially we will see what happens with Reiser4 as it faces the same or at 
least very simillar interface problems.  Maybe we need a sys_ntfs() or 
maybe we need to hitchhike the ioctl() interface or maybe the VFS can 
start providing all required functionality in some to be determined 
manner that we can use...
Best regards,
	Anton
