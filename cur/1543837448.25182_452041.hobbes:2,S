A good answer, even if it's one that can be found in the manual :-).

I don't think so.
If it doesn't take into account own changes, then the -n command is
unable to produce even a slightly accurate resemblence of what would
happen if I did a real run.
And that's about the only use case I can come up with for -n...

If it's complete inaccurate, I can't trust the result, so that doesn't
help me much, if any.

Thanks a lot for checking !
I wonder then, will it write back this alternate superblock?
Is there anything I can do to control the process, like:
Do a test mount with one of the alternate superblocks?
Tell fsck to test a specific superblock; afterwards tell fsck to use a
specific superblock?
That would be useful.

Ok, that's very good to know, thanks a lot.
