Doesn't work for me.
Now, taking off my "open source co-operative hat" and placing my
"reality" hat on, I'd suggest that anyone who finds that APM doesn't
work to consider it a dead loss - It's an obsolete technology, and
therefore no one is interested in it anymore.  I've reported the
problem multiple times here and there's been very little, if any,
reaction, so this seems to back that up.
Now, imagine the PCMCIA maintainer being unable to test the suspend/
resume functionality during the stability freeze.  Oh, sorry, you
don't have to imagine that hard. 8)
