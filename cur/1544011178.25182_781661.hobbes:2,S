I checked maildir_sort(), and it wasn't called with
maildir_header_cache_verify unset. In the source, it looks like this:
#if USE_HCACHE
    if (option(OPTHCACHEVERIFY))
    {
      DO_SORT();
      ret = stat(fn, &lastchanged);
    }
...
   if (ctx->magic == M_MH)
      data = mutt_hcache_fetch (hc, p->h->path, strlen);
    else
      data = mutt_hcache_fetch (hc, p->h->path + 3, &maildir_hcache_keylen);
...
#endif /* USE_HCACHE */
    DO_SORT();
So DO_SORT() is called _after_ reading the header cache if
maildir_header_cache_verify is unset, which is too late, because the
hard disk seeks to death if the cache is read with the unsorted inode
list.
