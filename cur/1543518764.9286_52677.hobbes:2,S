   Have you tested this change for both modular and non-modular cases?  It
   doesn't look right to me...
It works for now because __initdata and __init are no-op's in the
modular case.  This does make me a bit nervous, though, since I'm not
sure this is always going to be a fair assumption.  
Comments?  Are there are any plans to implement __init and __initdata
for modules?
