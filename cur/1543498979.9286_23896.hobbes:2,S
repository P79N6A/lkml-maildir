If you can show with actual benchmarks how much slower is the worst case,
and if the slow down isn't too bad (or is inexistant), then it should
definitely be integrated.
We just have to come up with the worst case and a benchmark for it so we
can try it on various configs.  Is linear access to a big
file the worst case ?  Isn't there something worse ?
