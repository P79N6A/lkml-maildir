Hi,
I need to access each and every packet that my host is sending out on the network.  For this I need to know which function and file is used by the network device driver before it sends the packet to the wire.  I need to put some delay into this code so that the sending of packets is delayed somehow.  I'm using Linux redhat 6.1 kernel version 2.2.12-20. 
Any kernel hackers around here ??
Thanks in anticipation,
Sincerely,
Aamir
