I have a version stable for the KT400 chipset, it is the KT600 which is
unstable now.  As soon as I finish resolving the issues one of my
customers is having with the KT600, it will be released shortly there
after.
Some of the problems appear with the APIC routing and interrupts being
lost and not begin processed.
