It "would have been" ideal if the original ioctl() parameter passing
was done like this. DEC called it a $DESCRIPTOR. Every sys-call had
a length, followed by a type, followed by whatever... 
However, since we emulate Unix, to do this thing at this late date
means that the length of every one of those structures has to be known
to the C library interface. This may not be Good(tm).
