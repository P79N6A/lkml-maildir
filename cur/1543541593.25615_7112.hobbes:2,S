I wish people would shut up about the icons.

"Forks" or "Streams" or whatever already
exist in a number of commercially
prevalent filesystems. It would be nice
to have Linux work with them well; ergo,
it would be nice to have Linux support
some standard method of exporting streams
in some way to make them user-accessible
without breaking existing unix FS semantics,
and without making streams in FSes that
support them hard/silly/etc to use.
Linus' suggestion of a namespace augmentation
-- allowing "/" after a filename -- fits the
bill.
Once we have a way to access streams in NTFS,
HFS, HPFS, etc., there still will not be any
streams/EAs in Ext2, Ext3, or ReiserFS (current
favorites for "linux default FS" depending on 
who you ask).
Maybe in Linux 8.2, the default filesystem will
support streams. But until then, application
designers will not use them, because they :
(1) probably won't be there
(2) won't be portable to other Unix OSes
So, to echo Linus, the issue is one of 
implementation, not icons, tarfs, etc.
