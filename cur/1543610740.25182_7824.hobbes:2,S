Problem with -fomit-frame-pointer which caused gcc-3.0.X generate ICE on 
8139too.c is now fixed in gcc-3_0-branch. For example kernel 2.4.16-pre1 
builds Ok with gcc-3.0.3 20011123 (prerelease). Also 8139too.c compiles Ok 
and kernel seems to work Ok.
I have also earlier met cases when gcc-3.0.X miscompiles source (with option 
-fomit-frame-pointer only) due to same bug however it always caused crashes
of compiled source for me, not a silent data corruption.
