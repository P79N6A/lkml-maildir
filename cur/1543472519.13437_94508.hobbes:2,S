Subject: Question relating to VLAN 802.1Q implementation.

If this type of question is better served on another list, please
let me know...
I've started adding 802.1Q VLAN support.  Hacking the kernel is actually
easier
than I first expected (though I ain't done yet!!).
However, I still have a question or two!
First:  There is a device struct found in <linux/netdevice.h>.  It has
a type field.  After some grep'ing though the code, I think that this
field must correspond to the values defined in <linux/if_arp.h>.  Is
this true?  (Has anyone suggested moving a bunch of the #defines to
enums??)
If so, I think I need to add one to handle the VLAN type of device.  Do
I
just get to pick my favorite un-used number, or are they defined in some
standard somewhere?
Thanks,
Ben
