Perhaps this is not the best moment for this question, but I'm by now
developing an extension for the IPC under Linux, and I have been
experimenting whith the clonation. The matter is: I don't agree the
signal behaviour for clones sharing its pid's.
	Try this secuence: 
	A process "P" clones itsef (P'), sharing memory map, files, fs, AND
PID, but not the signal handlers.
	After the clonation, 
	    * the process "P" handles the SIGUSR1 signal (signal 10) whith the
function handlerP(...)
	    * the process "P'" handles the SIGUSR1 signal whith handlerP2(...)
		int handlerP( ... ) {
			printf("Hi, I'm P\n");
		}
		int handlerP2( ... ) {
			printf("Hi, I'm P'\n");
		}	
	If we see the process list, whe obtain a response similar to this:
		$ ps | grep P
                 PID TTY STAT TIME COMMAND
		1262   1 S    0:00 P
		1262   1 S    0:00 P
		$
	sending a signal to a pid 1262 we could expect both processes to
receive it, but...
		$ kill -10 1262
		Hi, I'm "P'"!
		$
	Here only one of both processes receives the signal. Which one? When
looking into the kernel code, we can find it: The only process that
receives the signal is the first one the scheduler select for got the
CPU.
	My question is:
		Ok, Linux allow to clone a process sharing the pid but not the
handler. Then, Is this not the correct behaviour for signals to be sent
to both processes? 
		I think NO. This wouldn't be consequent whith the semantic for the
signals in unix.
	I think the wrong step is allowing the clones to share its pid's.
	What is the meaning of share pid's? I don't find any meaning for it.
	What do you think about this?
							Thanks.
