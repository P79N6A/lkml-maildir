James/Jeff thanks for following the issue but NAK. ;)
Causes regression wrt ide-floppy CDROMEJECT/CDROMCLOSETRAY support when
compared to 2.6.22 and SG_IO is not supported by ide-{disk,scsi,tape}.
Luckily Linus has already fixed the issue properly.
BTW cmd == 1 IOCTL is not defined/used by IDE driver.
Thanks,
Bart
