LVM updates the snapshot redirection without knowing that the new
redirection location has been written?  So if I write to a LVM
snapshot and take a crash, I might not actually get either the old or
the new data, but in fact some previous random contents of a new
block?  Eek.  Journaling will not like that.  Databases won't like
that.  Anything that relies on fsync to ensure some write ordering on
disk will be potentially upset by that.

No.  The commercial systems write snapshots to a new area, usually.
There are two very good reason for that --- when you come to delete a
snapshot, there's no IO involved; and you avoid fragmenting the
original root volume.  
In systems I'm familiar with, the copy-out is always done in the same
direction with the snapshot getting the new block.  This even happens
if the snapshot is writable: regardless of whether it is the snapshot
or the root being written, the copy-out always results in the snapshot
getting moved, not the root.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
