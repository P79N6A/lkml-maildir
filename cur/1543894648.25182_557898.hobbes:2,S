You forgot something.  Namely, that file *without* any mentioning of
GPL or other license is either illegal to distribute at all, under
any license, *OR* inherits the default license of the project.  Which
is to say, what is stated in COPYING.
Take your pick.  For what it's worth, it would be interesting to hear
the opinion of RMS - both on how much of the kernel is possible to
distribute under v3 according to him and on the morality of your position.
