RH9 errata kernel 2.4.20-19.9, I also tried 2.6.0-test3-mm3.
On a sidenote, I also tried its driver on W98SE, WinXP.
Same result with the MinGW compiled test programs.

Hmm, how comes the same settings *work* on real 16550?
Even under Win*, with the MinGW compiled testprograms...

I tried it now, thanks. Same thing happens. I set up two different
minirc, /etc/minirc.dfl using /dev/ttyS0 and /etc/minirc.usb
for /dev/ttyUSB0. In one terminal, I typed 'minicom', in another
'minicom usb'. In the 'minicom usb' what I type, appears in the
other window, but keys typed in the 'minicom' do not appear in
'minicom usb'.
I am starting to be convinced that it is a hardware flaw.
I will try to replace it.

I wasn't prepared to this answer. ;-)
