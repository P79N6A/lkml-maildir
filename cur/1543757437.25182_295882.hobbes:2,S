Thanks for the comments. Although all your comments are valid, we will
not be able to apply your patch as is. This is because of the way we
have set up our source code (some of which is shared with non-GPL code).
We will submit a patch that addresses all the issues you've raised here.
We will apply your patch to ixgb_main.c as is.
Thanks,
Ganesh.
