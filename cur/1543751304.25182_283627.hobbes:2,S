Hi,
I'm building a diskless boot kernel, with kernel version 2.6.9 and
2.6.10-RC3. The client is able to connect to the server, and load the boot
image. However, whenever it reached encryption tests, the client machine
hangs at there. For different kernel version, it hangs at different
encryption tests. Does anyone know what's causing this problem?
For version 2.6.10-RC3, it hangs at the first test of sha384 cross page:
Testing sha384 cross page
test1:
(hangs at this point)
Thanks
Allen
