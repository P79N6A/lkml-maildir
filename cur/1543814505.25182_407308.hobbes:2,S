Makes perfect sense, except that it doesn't match what I see through
"debugfs" - logdump :(
I wrote a testcase to re-write same blocks again & again - there is
absolutely nothing showed up in log. Which implied to me that, all 
the jorunal_dirty_data we did on all those buffers, did nothing -
since there is no current transaction. What am I missing ?
Thanks,
