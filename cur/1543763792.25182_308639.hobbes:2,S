The IOC4 device that provides IDE, serial ports and external interrupts
on Altix systems has a big endian register layour, and the PCI-X bridge
in those Altix systems can do the swapping if a special bit is set.
In older kernels that bit was set from the driver through a special API,
but it seems the firmware does that automatically now.
