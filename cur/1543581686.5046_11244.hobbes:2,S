If you've configured ISA PnP support into the kernel, then the driver
ignores those settings unless you specify isapnp=0.  What I'd suggest
is that you try disabling the configuration done by the isapnp tools,
which can be done on RedHat and derived systems by renaming your
/etc/isapnp.conf to something else.  There seem to be some issues
with resetting the PnP configuration with isapnp after the in-kernel
ISA PnP driver has done its stuff, as a couple of other people have
mentioned similiar problems.
