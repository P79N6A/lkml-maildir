I noticed this problem some time ago when trying to see whether the
darcs repository is consistent with the BK one:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110026570201544&w=2
A solution is to use the "(Logical change ...)" string within each
file's commit log instead of the date (I realised that it is simpler
to write a shell script to generate the diffs rather than modifying
cvsps).
