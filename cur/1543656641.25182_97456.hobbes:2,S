AFAIK, this is because you have some GB of memory (RAM) that are beeing 
used as disk-cache. It took 22 seconds for the cached writes-to-disk 
being flushed to the device.
If 22 seconds is too much for the amount of cached disk-writes is 
another story :)
Maybe 3ware controllers are slow with many disks? Try the same with only 
3 disks to eliminate this variable.
