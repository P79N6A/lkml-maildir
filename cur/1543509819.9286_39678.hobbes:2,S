Hi:
	The following change introduced in 2.2.7 breaks identd on setuid
processes like rlogin.

/proc/net/tcp is the only (if there is another one, please let me know :)
easily accessible interface from userspace to find the uid of the creator
of a TCP connection.  identd returns information based on this.
Now in the case of a setuid client like rlogin, the real uid is ther user
in question, while the euid and the fsuid are both root.  What identd should
return of course is the user's login name, not root.  This used to work fine 
because /proc/net/tcp returned i_uid, which was the real uid.  But the change
in 2.2.7 meant that it now returns root.
For more detail on this problem, please go to

Now what I'd like to see is to have /proc/net/tcp again list the real uids
instead of the fsuids (if anyone actually has some use for the fsuids, maybe
you can list both of them).
