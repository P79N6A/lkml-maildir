I have some now. These are raw lines from /proc/net/dev. In this case it's
eth0 at 22:14 that chucked a wee wibbly.

To clarify it's an Intel Dual Core Xeon (I just wound up as thinking of
them all as amd64s). Network card driver in use is the one defined by
CONFIG_BNX2. Kernel's monolithic.

Yes. With 32bit compat for executables built in.
