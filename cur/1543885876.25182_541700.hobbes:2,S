Agreed.  I've still got a GUS in one of my museum pieces that runs
MS-Win 3.1 by default.  The BIOS is too old to support booting from
anything except hda, sda and floppy, but because I enjoy pain I'll
be happy to modify the startup floppy images for a 2.6.X-based live
CD distro (DSL, anyone?) and give the new drivers a spin when they're
ready for testing.  The motherboard is a curiosity: it has ISA, PCI,
*and* VLB slots.  The processor is an AMD 5x86 (think 486 on steroids).
I *might* have 32 MB of RAM to work with: I simply don't remember :-).
