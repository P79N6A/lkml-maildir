Hmm, with the exception of raw1394, the rest of ieee1394 subsystem does
not need its own classes as 1394 devices hook up into other subsystems
(SCSI, NET) and are classified with the rest of the devices in those
systems. After all userspace does not really care whether eth0 is on
PCI, ISA or IEEE1394, all it needs to know that it is just another network
interface. Am I missing something?
