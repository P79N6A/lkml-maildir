Wait, your benchmark is comparing against the unrolled code?

How big is the -code- footprint?

Whoa. We've regressed something horrible here:
http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/fba056363c99d4f9?dmode=source&hl=en
In 2003, I was getting 17MB/s out of my Athlon. Now I'm getting 2.7MB/s.
Were your tests with or without the latest /dev/urandom fixes? This
one in particular:
