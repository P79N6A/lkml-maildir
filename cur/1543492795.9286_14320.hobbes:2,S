Read man 5 exports. 
This is an old well-known problme with NFS(v2). It doesn't do uid/gid
translation. That's why you should set a NIS+ Server or ensure manually that
the uids/gids are equal on all NFS shared systems. That's also the reason
for the root_squash option.
On the other hand it tells you about the possibility to use a map_daemon.
There's a rpc.ugidd binary (somehow belonging to the unfsd server) on my
system, but I've never used it, nor do I know somebody doing that. 
Cheers,
