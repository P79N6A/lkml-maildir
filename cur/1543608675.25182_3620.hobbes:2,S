You know how to parse the file. 
Take a look at /proc/partitions. Is its exact syntax obvious without 
examining the source in the kernel? Can it happen that there is a space or 
another unusual character in the device path and what happens then? Could it 
be that someone decides that an additional column is neccessary and how can 
my parser stay compatible then? Are there any suprises or special conditions 
that I don't know about? Maybe one of the fields is hexadecimal but I think 
it is decimal, I can't see it from looking at the file's content.
