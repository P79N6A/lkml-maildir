Ok, I guess I was wrong -- there's no guarantee that protects stuff from
bleeding into a critical region from after it. Comments in line 54-58 of
kernel/wait.c seems to imply this. Nevermind the fact that most other
architectures seem to protect it anyway. :-)
However, please do fix the comment earlier in the function that implies
that the unlock does indeed do enough barriers while you're at it,
since it seems to be incorrect and misleading.
