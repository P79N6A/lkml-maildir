Subject: NFS speed problem when appending data to existing files

Hello,
the following command
for i in `seq 1 10240`; do dd if=/dev/zero bs=100 count=1 2> /dev/null | tee -a tmp0; done
is very slow on a nfs mounted homedir and I get lots of error messages
nfs: server xxxxxx not responding, still trying
nfs: server xxxxxx OK
on the client side (2.4.22, server is a 2.4.21 kernel based nfsd). Only
appending small amounts of data to an existing file shows the problem.
Writing a large file happens at FastEthernet speed flawlessly. Any help,
please?
Thanks,
Torsten
