You could enable STATS in mm/slab.c, then the number of alloc and free
calls would be printed in /proc/slabinfo.

Could you check /proc/sys/net/core/hot_list_length and skb_head_pool
(not available in /proc, use gdb --core /proc/kcore)? I doubt that this
causes your problems, but the skb_head code uses a special per-cpu
linked list for even faster allocations.
Which network card do you use? Perhaps a bug in the zero-copy code of
the driver?
