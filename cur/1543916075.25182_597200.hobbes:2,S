Then we can't benefit of the __init section to have the code removed
after boot. I don't see the point in doing so.

printk() is just an example taken from my current instrumentation. Let's
say I plan to instrument kmalloc() (which will happen someday): it's
used in every context, including NMI. And it's not because printk is
broken that its instrumentation can afford to be broken even further,
that logic seems wrong to me. Somebody go fix printk then ;)
