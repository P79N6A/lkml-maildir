I will use HAS_IOMEM then. The oddity with the select statement still
exists though. I have to add the "depends on HAS_IOMEM" to SSB and B44.
If I just add it to SSB then the config option for B44 exists for s390
and you can enable it. The select statement will then enable SSB as well
(.config contains CONFIG_SSB=y for allyesconfig). This is in
contradiction to the depends statement since HAS_IOMEM=n on s390.
The current Kconfig code does not check all select statements if they
can be enabled before allowing the config option that does the select.
So the rule for using select statements is that the depends line of the
config option that selects another config option needs to be at least as
restrictive as the depends line of the selected option. Hence I'll add
the HAS_IOMEM depends to B44 as well. Okay ?
