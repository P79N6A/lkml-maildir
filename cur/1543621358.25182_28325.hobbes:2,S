This is still not a very good way to control the names.
What I have is a cluster of nearly 100 machines - all but one of them have
no disk.  When something goes down on one of the machines, I would like to
know (a) what it was that went down and (b) which machine it was on.
I would also like to have the core files someplace that is writable (all
but the /coredumps directory is read-only - oh, and the local tmpfs mounts
for /var and /etc)

I was very carefull to keep that behavior consistant with 2.4.17.  That
is, if you do nothing different with the kernel.core_name_format then it
will work just as before.  And only root can change that sysctl.
As to "overwrites" and the like, I have much less overwrites with most
any pattern form than with just plain "core"  And I can support features
that many people have wanted (%N.core being a very popular construct).
