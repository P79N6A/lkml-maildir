   I think I like this.
   
I don't.
If the concept isn't all that important, why bother?
See, if you have to allocate a whole new routine, you'll think
about whether it makes sense or not.
It's like adding a new system call, and the same arguments apply.
I don't want a 'flags' thing, because that tends to be the action
which opens the flood gates for putting random feature-of-the-day new
bits.
If you have to actually get a real API change made, it will get review
and won't "sneak on in".  I also don't want architectures adding arch
specific flag bits that some drivers end up using, for example.
The suggested scheme allows that, and I can guarentee you that people
will do things like that.
You must take the time to get the semantics right and make sure they
really do handle the cases that are problematic.  Random flag bits
passed to a "do everything" dma_alloc function don't encourage that at
all.
