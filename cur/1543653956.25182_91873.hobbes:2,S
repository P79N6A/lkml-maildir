Something must be wrong with this one, I experience an immediate hard lockup
when trying to use a ippp-connection. No way around it, always happens. And no
panic message or anything, just complete immediate lockup. This is with hisax +
AVM Fritz PCI 2.0 + SMP + SuSE 8.1 distro installation.
Anybody else with the same problem?
rc2 works for _some_ connections (after a while I have to reload the drivers to
work again). All 20pre version work without any problem at all.
Regards,
Stephan
