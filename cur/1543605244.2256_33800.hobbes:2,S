... and if somebody thinks that replacing
int foo(void *bar);
plus
EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo);
with
int __foo(void *bar, int baz);
static int foo(void *bar)
{
	return __foo(bar, 0);
}
plus
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__foo);
is going to save you from aforementioned killer penguins, keep in mind
that there are worse and slower ways to go and you might not like learning
them first-hand.
