Man, good to see I'm not the only one who can't type ;-)
Yeah, the other laptop is an Inspiron I guess, I was googling for Dell and
Linux problems and had a brain fart. That said, yes, I have a "Latitude
C600" here, and when I exit X via logout it almost always hangs, the
screen turns pink, and I need to power cycle.
Given that yours doesn't do that, did you use:
- a custom XF86 config
- XFree from someone other than Redhat
- some custom config of X
- anything else you did?
Obviously I would rather not have the system hang all the time, better
even than having it boot fast ;-)
I've been running *very* recent kernels, mainly because the RH didn't work
any better. If you have a better install I'd like to hear it, although the
issues which pushed me to NSLG and 19-pre2 or news kernels are hard to
ignore.
Then again, several people have told me that they had multiple Dell
laptops and only some of them did this. Can you say "quality control" or
"running production changes?"
Thanks much for anything you can suggest, but in the meantime I will be
saving some dmesg output from ext2 and ext3 boots.
