Hi,
I'm trying to use my Linux laptop to serve Solaris Jumpstarts.  The long
and short of it is, kernel 2.4.19 serves NFS to Jumpstart clients just
fine, but after that release something changed.  With subsequent
releases (including 2.6.3), the Solaris Jumpstart client just hangs
after mounting the miniroot.  It's still ping-able, but it doesn't go
any further.  If it's any help, here are the last few lines of tcpdump
output up to the point where the client hangs:

Note -- the read only file system errors also show up during a
successful run using kernel 2.4.19.
Any help is greatly appreciated -- I don't want to have to dual-boot
Solaris x86 just so I can serve Jumpstarts in the field (for that
matter, I'm not convinced Solaris x86 has the drivers to support my
laptop anyway).
Thanks,
