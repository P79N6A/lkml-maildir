Subject: [PATCH 004 of 5] md: Make sure read errors are auto-corrected during a 'check' resync in raid1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Whenever a read error is found, we should attempt to overwrite with
correct data to 'fix' it.
However when do a 'check' pass (which compares data blocks that are
successfully read, but doesn't normally overwrite) we don't do that.
We should.
