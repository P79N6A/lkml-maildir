Due to popular demand for my patches to the VMware 2.x modules which make 
the modules compile on kernels 2.4.9+, I have made them available for 
download on the web:
http://www-stu.christs.cam.ac.uk/~aia21/vmware/vmware2.stm
The above web page also contains a short howto on how to install the 
patched modules...
Best regards,
