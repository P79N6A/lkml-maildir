Yeah, elantech_init() is too late, we need to do something in
elantech_detect()... What did /proc/bus/input/devices show before
2.6.28? Logitech, right? Maybe we need to pull part of Logitech check (number
of buttons for example) from logips2pp.c. We'd need to test with real elantech
touchpads too though.
