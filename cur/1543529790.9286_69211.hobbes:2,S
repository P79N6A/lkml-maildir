I know that, but I do not like it very much. (Though I do not know wether splitting
OSs is somewhat evolutionary.) At least for the linux kernel "In a world without
walls and fences, who needs Windows and Gates." would be lesser true. If I would
want reiserfs only for people in Germany, for example, I would not need to comment
anything, because I think that it's pretty probable that SuSE will include reiserfs
in their kernel if it's not done.

I think so.

Mhh... it works, but it is deemed unclean and|or out of sync. Would some promise of
the reiserfs developers (I do not know wether they would do that, but I think so)
to clean and sync the code with the current VFS within the next (say 3) weeks help?
(I don't know how much time it would take) I think they will do it anyway, but
missing 2.4 and waiting another 80 weeks because being synced 2 weeks after a
negative inclusion decision is somewhat hard and disappointing, especially after
putting highest efforts for the 2.4 months. If reiserfs is decided to have missed
2.4, development will slow down, because reiserfs developers would have to maintain
2 versions (for 2.4 and 2.5), because there would be less user interaction (feature
requests, bug reports, maybe co-developers) and because people would see their work
and time spent the last months between their bills in the bin and not in /sbin. ;o)

No, I defined choice to mean "you are asked for" (this does not necessarily mean
that you get it, that's another question), and I define chance to mean "if you want
to AND you know that it's possible, you can"

I know that. And I also do not know a perfect system, as I did not know a perfect
example for representing chance and choice and the difference between them. Maybe I
should add to the example that I mean "the chance to influence" and "the choice to
influence" (though I do not know wether this is correct in english grammar...)
Another definition: chance: you have to be active to get the results; choice: your
required activity is reduced to say "yes" or "no".
Hope this untangles. :o)
