Peter,
I don't think you understand what libpfm actually does and therefore
you rush to the wrong conclusion.
At its core, libpfm does NOT know anything about the perfmon kernel API.
I think you missed that, unfortunately.
It is a helper library which helps tool writer solves the event-> code
-> counter assignment problems.
That's it. It does not make any perfmon syscall at ALL to do that.
Proof is people have been using it on
Windows, I can also use it on MacOS.
Looking at your proposal, you think you won't need such a library and
that the kernel is
going to do all this for you. Let's go back to your kerneltop program:
KernelTop Options (up to 4 event types can be specified):
 -e EID    --event_id=EID     # event type ID                     [default:  0]
                                  0: CPU cycles
                                  1: instructions
                                  2: cache accesses
                                  3: cache misses
                                  4: branch instructions
                                  5: branch prediction misses
                                < 0: raw CPU events
Looks like I can do:
$ kerneltop --event_id=-0x510088
You think users are going to come up with 0x510088 out of the blue?
I want to say:
$ kerneltop --event_id=BR_INST_EXEC --plm=user
Where do you think they are going to get that from?
The kernel or a helper user library?
Do not denigrate other people's software without understanding what it does.
