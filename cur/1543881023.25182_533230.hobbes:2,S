You probably want to consider the controlling terminal as well...  do 
you want to have people starting 'at' jobs competing on equal footing 
with people typing at a terminal? I'm not offering an answer, just 
raising the question.
And for some database applications, everyone in a group may connect with 
the same login-id, then do sub authorization to the database 
application. euid may be an issue there as well.
