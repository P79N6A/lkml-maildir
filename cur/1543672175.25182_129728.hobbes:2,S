I can't remember that the MPI spec tells anything about intercepting
syscalls..

so use get_user_pages.

Umm, pinning memory all the time means you get a bunch of nice DoS
attachs due to the huge amount of memory.

That's a horribly b0rked approach..
Again, where's your driver source so we can help you to find a better
approach out of that mess?
