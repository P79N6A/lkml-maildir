i was trying to compile squid-2.5.STABLE3 with arp acl support in my
i686-pc-linux-gnu box.
squid/src/acl.c include <linux/if_arp.h>
so while compiling i got warning that an include file should not be used
outside the kernel
modifying linux/if_arp.h:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#include <linux/netdevice.h>
#endif
resolve the problem
