I believe 0 is what we have used elsewhere.
A negative value for a pid is likely to be taken as the group of all
processes, or -EPERM, and it does really confusing things when fed through
the current f_getown implementation, with PIDTYPE_PGRP.
The only other possible interpretations of 0 are the idle process and
yourself.  There is still some potential there, but largely 0 is much
less likely to be confused than -1.  Especially as it doesn't change
when you negate it.
