I looked at the patch, it didn't look unstable, unclean or insubstantial.  It 
looked like a fairly straight-forward and elegant mod, to me.
I note that there have been 4 released versions of the patch, going back to 
2.0.29.  One would have thought it was in a reasonable position to go into 
2.2.1.
Although I am not the author of the work in question, if it was me, I'd be 
looking for some reasoned feedback as to why it's not in the kernel already, 
otherwise I'd become rapidly disenchanted, discouraged and demotivated.
I doubt that's good for Linux.
Colin.
