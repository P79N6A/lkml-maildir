But better use a higher bank (128 or somesuch). It wouldn't surprise
me if Intel did something similar to their MCE architecture as 
they did for their performance counters, and then 20 banks 
in the hardware would be quite possible.

Use per cpu data for this.

Does the comment match the code? I guess you mean the following
events after the first can be bogus.
It seems a bit bogus to printk but not log for known spurious 
conditions.
Also the next_check logic should already handle this I guess,
becaumse I assume the temperature dropping won't take
that long.  So I guess it would be best to drop that 
and if it's still a problem use a longer next_check timeout
of several seconds.
Rest looks good.
