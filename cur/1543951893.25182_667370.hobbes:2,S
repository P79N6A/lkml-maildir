Ha, may be my mailer is broken with inline patch. I will attach the next 
one.

Ok I will change that

It's a bit that should be set for these commands. I will add a comment
about that.

when I did this code, I was wondering where to plug the hook and was 
thinking about auto-discovering of atacb device.
I think I can remove it now and replace it with a message.
But I should find a way to discover other devices supporting atacb. May 
be I will do a userspace tool for that.

Oh, I suppose I need to port this to lastest git.
- I updated the patch to git version (I have to change some stuff for 
scsi) and I follow the above comments.

PS : I don't have a running kernel git version. So I only build the mass 
storage driver with this patch, I didn't run it.
