Hi,
	Sometime in the 2.1 kernel series, the serial driver was
significantly changed to remove all explicit support for Boca multi-port
serial boards.  I assume that this was done to make the serial driver more
generic and it will still support Boca Boards if I set it up properly
(using setserial and whatnot).  I have looked through the relevent FAQs and
the man pages and I haven't found anything that works.  I suspect that all
of the documentation is out of date or I am missing something fundamental.
	When I run setserial (version 2.15) with either get_multiport or
set_multiport options set, I get an IO error.
Any ideas?
Aaron
