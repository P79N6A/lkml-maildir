Line 3 of the .config files has the current date in it. Is this
information of any use to anyone? It makes life difficult when
producing series of patches that touches a defconfig, as you end
up with conflicts if you go back and change/remove/add one to the
series.
Would people object to the time/date being removed from the .config
file?
