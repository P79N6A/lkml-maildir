Ok, Nigel clarified it pretty well. Thanks.

Well, it just affects how much time error we gain on suspend/resume. We
can't be perfect (well, unless our active timesource is persistent
clock), and the comment points that we're just trying to minimize the
error.

Interesting patch. Indeed, the trade off is just how quickly you want to
boot vs how much drift you gain each suspend/resume cycle. Assuming all
of the clocks are good, your patch could introduce up to 2 seconds of
drift each suspend/resume cycle.

Not really. The issue is present with or without my code.
