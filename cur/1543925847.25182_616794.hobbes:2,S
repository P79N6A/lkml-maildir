I do see some write-ish things happening inside of the nfsd_sync_dir()
call chain: the fsync() and filemap_fdatawrite().
The danger here is that the moment you mnt_drop_write(), the filesystem
is mounted r/o by someone else, then those fsync() writes occur when
everyone thinks it is r/o.  So, I think your fix is the most
conservative, and the most correct.

Otherwise, looks good to me.  Thanks.
