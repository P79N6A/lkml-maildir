Hmmm, well, that comment is a bit misleading.  Bitmasks on ppc64 (and
other bigendian 64-bit architectures such as sparc64) are stored as an
array of unsigned longs, i.e. 64-bit values.  The layout is such that
bit N is set iff (p[N/64] && (1UL << (N%64))) != 0, where p is an
unsigned long *.  In other words, a bitmask with only bit 0 set looks
like this, as an array of bytes:
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00...

Why do you have to reference them as u32?  Why can't you use unsigned
long instead?  That should Just Work.

That would be the wrong approach IMHO.
