Hi,
I just added 
"mydriver_tty_driver->init_termios = tty_std_termios"
to my init driver function.
Problem: But now I can't see data at user level application. It looks like flip_buffer needs to get termination character(or new line character) to push data to high level.
Which character should I add to flip_buffer to push data to high level? I tried to add '/n', it works, but after that user level gets '/n' as well. But I need something like a filter, to inform flip_buffer only, not user level application.
Thank you
