I believe that it is a bug that run_workqueue() is called
with interrupts off.  I've seen this reported on one other machine,
and Rui debugged it down to the BIOS returning from an SMM entry
with interrupts off:-(  So who knows, maybe run_workqueue()
had interrupts enabled and some AML triggered an SMM
to have the same failure here?
Re: executing AML's blindly.
Yes, and no.  We do know exactly what we interpret --
but yes, it is the BIOS writer that wrote the AML:-(
Above a ACPI interrupt has been deferred to non-interrupt
context for the OS to run its AML handler.  Unfortunately,
we somehow found ourselves running the work-queue with
interrupts off...
Also, the assert above is about to be hidden by a real
bug fix which I sent upstream today -- we'll not call cond_resched()
when  interrupts are off.
This is for the benefit of irqrouter_resume() 
which runs AML with interrupts off.
