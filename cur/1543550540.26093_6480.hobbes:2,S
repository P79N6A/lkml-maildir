Hi all,
My Xircom RBEM56G-100 almost completely stops working in the latest test9-pre8
and pre9 versions.  It will still get an IP address via DHCP, but that's it, no
pings or anything.
It works mostly correctly with test8 (quits responding when leaving promisuous
mode, and seems to hang under heavy load/collisions, but these are problems you
can usually live with).  
Backing out the attached patch returns it to the previous, mostly working
condition.
Later,
Tom
