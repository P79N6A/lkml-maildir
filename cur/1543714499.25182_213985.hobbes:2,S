Every single module which unregisters a struct device_driver.
 *      driver_unregister - remove driver from system.
 *      @drv:   driver.
...
 *      This will block until the driver refcount reaches 0, and it is
 *      released. Only modular drivers will call this function, and we
 *      have to guarantee that it won't complete, letting the driver
 *      unload until all references are gone.
