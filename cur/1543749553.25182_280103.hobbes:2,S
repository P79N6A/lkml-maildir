- Ask Voluspa to do
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/swap_token_timeout
  on 2.6.10-rc3 and retest.
- Dig out Rik's token-timeout-autotuning patch, make it apply, test it,
  then ask Volupsa and others to test that.
Have you time to look into the latter?
(We still don't know why it chews tons of CPU, do we?)
