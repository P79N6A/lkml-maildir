I can't remember for sure.  My system logs go back to June, and all of 
the errors back to then are on IRQ 7.  But I don't remember when I tried 
a different slot.

I'm giving this a go now that 2.6.5 didn't help.  With these parameters, 
/proc/interrupts looks like:
           CPU0       
  0:     509088          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       2408          XT-PIC  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          4          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:          0          XT-PIC  acpi
 10:      41821          XT-PIC  eth0, mga@PCI:1:0:0
 11:          0          XT-PIC  uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, EMU10K1, eth1
 12:       2102          XT-PIC  i8042
 14:     236597          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:        328          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
LOC:     509008 
ERR:       1693
MIS:          0
Seems like a lot of stuff on IRQ 11. . .

I already have everything I'm not using (serial, parallel ports) 
disabled.

I'll maybe give that a try at some point, if the IRQ balancing doesn't 
help.
Thanks again,
Chris
