I agree with that.  That's not my objection.  It's about pushing code
(albeit it's small and non-invasive) into the kernel that can be done in
userspace, that's all.

Clearly it's useful for the audio folks.  Whether it's the right thing
to go into the kernel is all that's in question here.  Do we agree it's
a stopgap measure making up for lack of a better general solution?
