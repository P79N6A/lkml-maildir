Subject: AMD64 overclock issue with 2.6.16 but not with 2.6.15

Do any one know of any other issues with amd64 and the
2.6.16 series?  I have run into a weird issue.
I have an AMD64 3200+ that runs at 2 GHz and runs *very* cool at about
34c.  My motherboard makes it pretty easy to overclock so I have
overclocked the 3200+ to 2.2 GHz and it has been running very stable
and still only around 39c.
When I was runing overclocked in 2.6.15 /proc/cpuinfo would show:
jim@keelie$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 15
model           : 47

cpu MHz         : 2200.000

                  lahf_lm ts fid vid ttp tm stc
bogomips        : 4409.17
Now with 2.6.16 it shows:
jim@keelie$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 15
model           : 47
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+
stepping        : 2
cpu MHz         : 2000.000
                 ^^^^^^^^^^
<snip>
bogomips        : 4409.17
The bogomips are showing the same though the kernel is not reporting
the correct MHz.  If I reboot and check the BIOS, the correct MHz is
reported.  I have not run any CPU benchmarks to see if performance is
really going back down to 2000 MHz.
Does anyone have a clue what could be causing this?
