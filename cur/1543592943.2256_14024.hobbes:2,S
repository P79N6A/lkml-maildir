Looks good.

I'm going to assume that the cls_tcindex.o in the second entry is a 
cut'n'paste error and should read sch_ingress.o.
Should the CLS_POLICE entry, then, read like this?
Traffic policing (needed for in/egress)
CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE
   Say Y to support traffic policing (bandwidth limits).  Needed for ingress
   and egress rate limiting.

A ``decay in the social contract'' is detectable; there is a growing
feeling, particularly among middle-income taxpayers, that they are not
getting back, from society and government, their money's worth for
taxes paid. The tendency is for taxpayers to try to take more control
of their finances ..
