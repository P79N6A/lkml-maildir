Yes. That'd be trivial. 
The system unique identifier needs to persistent across reboots, but
could also need to be changed without a reboot- kernel modules come and
go, and there might be an administrative reason to change the node WWN.
It doesn't necessarily have to be 'stored on disk' or set via a system
call- it shouldn't be as this is information that is needed prior mounting
root (possibly). 
There are a number of mechanisms to generate this. It seems to me that
this would be useful as a general kernel function, even prior to mounting
root. This actually takes this to a different level- a new UUID each boot
would indeed be not on point ridiculous, but arbitrary persistent
information available early at boot could be quite useful ("Gaak! A
Registry! aiee!"). There's a number of clever hacky ways to do this, not
least of which are more command line thingies- it's really more of a
question of where's the best natural place to store this system metadata
so that boot process code can get at it? Linux, so far, has punted this to
per-architecture space- sorry... I'm wandering and just musing here...
At any rate, this was all quite helpful. A user space UUID generator can
generate the seed WWN. I'll figure out some clever place to put it so
that a driver can get at it. It'd be nice if this was a generalizable
persistent system metadata solution that was not a per-platform different
mechanism (you know, OBP NVRAM for sparc, SRM NVRAM for Alpha, lilo
extensions for i386...).
Thanks- you helped me sort my muzzy thinking.
