Hi Folks,
I got a questions on printk and console_drivers. I have 2 serial ports 
and want to see output from all of them. So I registered 2 console 
driver using register_console. I can see the output from serial port 1 
after it was registered, but can't see any output from it after serial 
port 2 has been registered.
I don't why.
Thanks,
Gavin
