So it is.  The comment says, however, that "the existing code works
somewhat by accident."  In the case of the 9240 driver, however, the
existing code demonstrably does not work - it oopsed on me.  The patch
in Greg's tree looks fine (it's a straightforward fix, after all); I'd
recommend that it be merged before 2.6.13.
