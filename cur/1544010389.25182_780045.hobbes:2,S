I have a UPS for all of my machines, so that will not be a problem in my 
case.  I do not wish to trash a $720 SSD or my current install, if someone 
else wants to try feel free though :)
With barriers, presumably it would be safe-- but as always, a UPS/and 
barriers and/or RAID, there is no excuse not to have regular backups 
incase of a failure at any time..
I do recall however one instance where there was an apt-get dist-upgrade 
going and the power was cut to a machine on purpose (before/not 
using barriers) and suffice to say-- it got mucked/suffered many corruptions
all over the place.
