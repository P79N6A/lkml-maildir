[PATCH] I2C: Skip broken detection step in it87
One of the detection steps in the it87 chip driver was reported to be
broken for some revisions of the IT8712F chip [1] [2]. This detection
step is a legacy from the lm78 driver and the documentation available
for the IT8705F and IT8712F chips does not mention it at all. For this
reason, I propose to skip this detection step for Super-I/O chips.
Super-I/O chips have already been identified when we reach this step, so
it is redundant (additionally do being broken). This closes bug #4335.
