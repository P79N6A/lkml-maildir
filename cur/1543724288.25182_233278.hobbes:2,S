Well I dont think making them unlikely is necessary either, but 
realistically the amount of time added by the unlikely() check will be 
immeasurably small in real terms - and hitting it frequently enough will 
be washed over by the cpu as Ingo said. I dont think the order of 
magnitude of this change is in the same universe as the problem of 
scheduling latency that people are complaining of.
