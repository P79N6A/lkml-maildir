It may be reasonable to question them as "goals of 'Enterprise Computing'".
I found, on 
http://www.multicians.org/general.html,
 a list of those same 
nine goals, introduced by the sentence "As described in the 1965 paper 
Introduction and Overview of the Multics System by Corbató and Vyssotsky, 
there were nine major goals for Multics:"
While those were the goals of Multics, it is not at all clear that Multics 
would classify these days as a platform for "Enterprise Computing".  I'll 
note that the word "enterprise" does not appear in either the general FAQ 
page I cited, nor in the linked article it cites.
