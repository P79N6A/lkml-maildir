Sorry for not replying sooner I just got back from a trip.
I haven't though it through extremely closely but I believe
the stores into that variable in check_nmi_watchdog could 
legitimately be optimized away by the compiler if it doesn't
have a hint.  As the variable is auto and is never used
after the store without volatile it seems a reasonable
assumption that no one else will see the value.
If the variable was static the volatile would clearly be unnecessary
as we have taken the address earlier so at some point the compiler
would be obligated to but with the variable being auto the rules are a
little murky.
