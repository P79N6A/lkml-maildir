That makes sense... By that time, I took a look at the sources and found 
the prctl syscall, and with a little tweaking it was possible to do what 
I wish (keep reading)...

That's an interesting feature and is almost exactly what I needed: I 
wrote a daemon, which is started by root at boot time. In some point at 
startup, it chroot to an application-specific directory and gives up 
privileges. If it would dump core, it had to be on that directory, which 
has somewhat restrict permissions, so that I (and only I) can get it 
later for further analysis. By means of chroot + prctl it was possible 
to achieve this, but it would be simpler with this approach of yours, 
which could also help in debugging in case something else crashes. I'm 
inclined to adopting it, even though the daemon will ship to run on 
third-parties machines, and I'll have no much control of what kernel is 
running there (probably distribution default ones). I'll see what is 
possible here... Thank you!
