Couldn't even detach the list elements first by
list_splice_init(&mapping->robust_head->robust_list, head);
and free the list from "head" after releasing the mutex? 
This would reduce lock contention, no?

The goal here was to do cheap futex accounting, as described in the 
documentation to this patch.
