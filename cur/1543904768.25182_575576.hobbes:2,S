Subject: [PATCH] Fix lguest bzImage loading with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/26/514

Jason Yeh sent his crashing .config: bzImages made with
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y put the relocs where the BSS is expected, and we
crash with unusual results such as:
	lguest: unhandled trap 14 at 0xc0122ae1 (0xa9)
Relying on BSS being zero was merely laziness on my part.
