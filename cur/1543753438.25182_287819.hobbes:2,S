While it may be worthwhile to improve the scheduler, it's clear that
there isn't going to be a trivial "fix" for this issue, especially
since it's not even clear that anything is really broken.  Independent
of the scheduler work, it would be very useful to have a pipe
benchmark which at least made the dependencies on the scheduler
obvious.  So I think improving the scheduler and improving the LMbench
pipe benchmark are entirely complementary.
