Hello Till,
	This is a great question to ask on the Linux Scalability
mailing list: lse-tech@lists.sourceforge.net. We are devoted to
helping make Linux scale to large systems. Check out our work
at:

In my opinion 2.5 has more new functionality for scalability and
increased performance than 2.4 does right now. Since 2.5 is the
development kernel for new features and 2.4 is the stable series.
Expect to see backports of the best 2.5 features to 2.4 after they
have proven themselves.
Please let us know the results of running on your very large systems.
