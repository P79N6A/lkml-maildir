Doing some "classing" even by just euid might be a good idea. It would 
actually catch X automatically most of the time, because the euid of the X 
server is likely to be root, so even for the "trivial" desktop example, it 
would kind of automatically mean that X would get about 50% of CPU time 
even if you have a hundred user clients, just because that's "fair" by 
euid.
Dunno. I guess a lot of people would like to then manage the classes, 
which would be painful as hell.
