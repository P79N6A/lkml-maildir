   I'd *much* rather see massive breaking of everything under the sun
   instead of the gradual nibbling-to-death-by-ducks approach that's
   currently happening.   A wholescale breaking of interfaces to weed
   out the legacy code[1] may be for the better because (now that Linux
   is a Real Serious(tm) operating system) most of the user base uses
   tinned distributions and won't notice anything aside from the usual
   shimming of compatability libraries, most of the rest of the userbase
   will simply upgrade everything in sight to the latest and greatests,
   and those few heretics who still use a.out[2] will simply rev libc 4
   to libc 7 and cross their fingers that the compatability layer won't
   explode.
