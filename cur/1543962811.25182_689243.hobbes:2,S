Your question is a bit too terse for me to know exactly what you're
asking, but it is true that these IB drivers use writeq() only on 64-bit
architectures (since no 32-bit architectures even define writeq()!).
The hardware I'm dealing with is smart enough to cope with a driver that
does a write to these 64-bit registers in two 32-bit chunks, as long as
no other writes come in the middle.  So on 32-bit architectures I just
have a spinlock around two writel()s.
The assumption I'm making is that no locking or anything is needed on
64-bit architectures to avoid the writeq() being split into two
transactions with a third unrelated transaction in the middle.
It sounds as though Eric's hardware is much harder to deal with in that
it requires the write to a 64-bit register to be done in a single
transaction, and I'm not sure there is a way to do that on all 32-bit
architectures; certainly we have nothing clean and portable that a
driver can use to do that.
