But shouldn't that change wait until 2.5? Especially since another huge
mm change was just merged?
proc_pid_read_maps contains further bugs - afaics it it could skip lines
if PAGE_SIZE > 4096 and a file path is nearly 4096 bytes long.
I'll post a patch to proc_pid_read_maps - modifying the rw semaphore
behaviour just asks for trouble.
