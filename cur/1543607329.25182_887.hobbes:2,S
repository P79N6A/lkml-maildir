Just compiled 2.4.12-ac6 and noticed while booting that the screen was
not scrolling. I saw the penguin but when the text got to the end of the
screen it stopped. The system continued to boot and the screen recovered
when SysV started. I think the problem is only with kernel messages.
This did not happen with 0.1.0.
My card is: ATI Radeon QD DDR 32 MB
