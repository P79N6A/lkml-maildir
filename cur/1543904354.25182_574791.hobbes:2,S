The semantic that would benefit my work patterns the most would not be
"immediate zapping" - I have 2G of RAM, so often there's no memory pressure,
and often a 'find' will be followed by another similar 'find' that will hit a
lot of the same dentries and inodes, so may as well save them if we can.
Flagging it as "the first to be heaved over the side the instant there *is*
pressure" would suit just fine.
Or is that the semantic you actually meant?
