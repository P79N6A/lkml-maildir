Subject: [PATCH] linux-2.2.14/Documentation/sound/ALS007
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/2/26/115

Attached please find a small documentation patch that helps generalize
this file.  
Why it is needed:
  The current driver/sound/sb_common.c also works for the ALS-100
explicitly, (line 773) and just happens to work with the ALS-200.  the
Documentation/sound/ALS007 explains how to use the '007 code, but does not
explain the '100 code.  These methods worked for my ALS200 chip, and it
would be nice to tell people about it.
Further, I suggest:
  mv Documentation/sound/ALS007 Documentation/sound/ALSxxx
