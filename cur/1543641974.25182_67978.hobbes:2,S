And what if they both allocate the same disk block to another
file, simultaneously ?
A mount option isn't enough to achieve your goal.
It looks like you want GFS or OCFS. Info about GFS can be found at:
	
http://www.opengfs.org/
	
http://www.sistina.com/
  (commercial GFS)
Dunno where Oracle's cluster fs is documented.
