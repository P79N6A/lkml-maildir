Subject: [PATCH 3/3] new_inode_autonum: fix up possible i_ino collision in simple_fill_super()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

simple_fill_super() looked like a bug waiting to happen.  It is fairly hard to
trigger, but still. This should fix it, although in a fairly crude manner.
