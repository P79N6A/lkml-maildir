Depending on the camera model you can try some bandwidth reduction 
measures to try to make it send uncompressed video:
  - reduce frame rate. Something as low as 2 fps should be enough for 
motion detection.
  - reduce requested resolution. This of course depends on whether you 
have enough resolution or not.
  - selecting gray scale images. I don't know if your motion detection 
software is greatly affected by this, or not.
USB1.1 bandwidth is enought for 640x480, 8 bits gray scale (or color, 8 
bits bayer pattern), at 3 fps.
Of course, you can always buy a USB2.0 camera :)
