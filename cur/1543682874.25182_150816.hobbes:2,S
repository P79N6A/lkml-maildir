I really can't answer on that as I do neither know the hardware nor the BIOS
implementation well enough. Sorry.
BTW, it's no surprise that the x86info and cpufreq output are the same --
they use the same code. It'd be more interesting if Window$ uses the same
values [just mentioning it as you said PowerNow works on it, so....]
