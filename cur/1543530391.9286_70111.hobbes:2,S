That's not unreasonable, but I can certainly see situations where niced
tasks might be considered "more important" than non-niced tasks. Sometimes
this is due to your aforementioned bug in "nice". :-)

I more or less agree, but it would be nice if there were some way to
indicate to the kernel which processes not to kill when OOM. The current
behavior is no better than syncing the disks and crashing the machine.
