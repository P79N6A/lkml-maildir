Hi!
For the first time, I just got this error message:
  bash: /usr/local/bin/grep: Arg list too long
(I was searching using ``grep string */*'', now I'll do it
in a different way)
I'm wondering whether this is a bash or Linux process limit.
Is there a limit in Linux for the length of /proc/[0-9]+/cmdline?
Please Cc: me.
ciao,
johnny
