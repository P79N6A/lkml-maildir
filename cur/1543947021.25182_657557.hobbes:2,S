OK ... I think I've made a little more progress, but I think I am still
missing something....
I switched to the Open Source ATI Drivers. But there are issues with this :/
    1) I can't play Doom3, so if I want to, I have to switch drivers are
restart X .... but that's not the bigger issue.
tvtime loads now. I figured out what modules to load to create the
/dev/video0 device
tuner                  64360  0
cx8800                 40124  0
cx88xx                 72036  1 cx8800
ir_common              39620  1 cx88xx
tveeprom               20240  1 cx88xx
compat_ioctl32         11072  1 cx8800
btcx_risc               7432  2 cx8800,cx88xx
vivi                   21716  1
video_buf              28932  3 cx8800,cx88xx,vivi
videodev               30592  4 cx8800,cx88xx,vivi
v4l1_compat            14340  1 videodev
v4l2_common            22336  6
tuner,cx8800,cx88xx,compat_ioctl32,vivi,videodev
modprobe vivi creates the device
modprobe cx8800 (the bttv replacement from what I can tell)
then modprove tuner
ow the problem is tvtime (and xawtv) gets stuck on screen, can't kill
the process, even after restarting X, the process is still in memory :/
So I am still missing something ....
On the upside, I have YU12/YUY2 Overlays
From xine-check
    [ good ] found xvinfo: X-Video Extension version 2.2
    [ good ] your Xv extension supports YV12 overlays (improves MPEG
performance)
    [ good ] your Xv extension supports YUY2 overlays
    [ good ] Xv ports:  RGBA RGBT RGB2 YUY2 UYVY YV12 I420
so ... it's progress ... but I don't think a step forward :/ maybe a
step sideways .....
Anywho .. I am going to reboot one last time to get rid of these stuck
apps and reload the fglrx driver so I can play doom3.
Any more idea's would be greatly appreciated.
