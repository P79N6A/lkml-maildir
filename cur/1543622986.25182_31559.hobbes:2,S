My followup didn't make it, so here's a quick resend:
in that rsync version, after ^C, not all threads are killed, and the
remaining one wreaks havoc and eats all memory. NOT A KERNEL PROBLEM,
please apologize. (Running ulimit -v 30000 before or softlimit on rsync
cures this, obviously, to prevent the remaining runaway thread from
eating all memory.)
