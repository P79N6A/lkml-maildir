Buried deep within a patch[1], there exists a Perl script which will
input a description of [generally VGA-based] graphics hardware, and a
set of register states, and output a C header file.  Currently this C
header is only included into a 'genfb' module, which generically
supports any video device listed in that header.  However it will in the
future interface to a dump program I wrote which builds under cygwin32. 
So that you can use that to steal Win9x video mode info to build a basic
fbcon driver.
