You don't need tweaking those clock neither. The mobility chips have
dynamic clock & power management capabilities. I have code in radeonfb
to enable those, unfortunately, we (recent radeonfb's and XFree) will
disable most of those features because  of some ASIC rev. bugs. We
should ask ATI some more precise list of which revs are affected and
if there's a better workaround...

Yup, a PLL need time to properly stabilize, especially older ones.

By default, I think, the chip clocks itself on the PCI clock on powerup
(without BIOS). From that, you can then configure the PLLs, switch to PLL
derived clocks, initialize the memory controller, and go on...
But for mobility chips, there are additional "automatic" clock control
features, especially on r128 (M3) and radeons (M6/7/9/10) though I
suppose M1 may have similar features. Look at the code in my version
of radeonfb (2.4, it's not yet in 2.6 mainstream). I _much_ prefer
using those features than tweaking the PLLs, especially on those
new chips.
