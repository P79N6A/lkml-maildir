I didn't quite parse this :)
If the memory is leaking slowly, it could be eventually pushing
everything out to swap without having a large amount of mapped pages.
Or if something is slowly writing stuff to tmpfs, that may not show
up in mapped pages either.

Yeah, or a tmpfs filesystem being filled up (what does `df` say?).
