Most designs are not serious about performance, compatibility,
and real-time. Very few designs are serious about security and
persistent system image.
The HURD people don't seem to care about _any_ of those things.
There is a FreeBSD split that might try for scalable performance
(not low-level uniprocessor performance) and compatibility.
Cygnus is doing real-time and not much else.
There goes the "clear and present benefits".

Any UNIX-killer must also have:
* performance like Linux
* compatibility with Linux
* hard real-time support
* security at the B1 or B2 level at least (call it B1.5 if you want)
* persistent system image
* cool name like Linux (serious, these fail: GNU Hurd FreeBSD 386BSD)
* good support for Win32 emulation
I'd like to remind you that security does not exist if it must be
disabled for ease-of-use or Unix98 compatibility.
