Andi, nice thinking.
Can this (the current behaviour) be a security hole?
I'm thinking that two cloned threads could, on an i386 with the
broken WP protection:
  (a) read a file to hack to bring it into cache, e.g. /bin/su
  (b) does a shared writable mapping of some writable file that is not in cache
      (use your imagination)
  (c) thread #2 spins checking a flag
  (d) thread #1 writes the flag and then writes to the writable mapping
  (e) thread #1 blocks to pull in the page
  (f) thread #2 sees the flag and maps /bin/su into place (read only)
  (g) the page comes in though the mapping is no longer present
  (h) thread #1 unblocks and overwrites a page of /bin/su
  (i) run /bin/su, get root with no password check, H940R D00D2 R001
      --> there isn't even any evidence on disk
This will not happen if, when thread #1 blocks, the remapping is blocked
by a lock.  But I'm not sure, is it?  I don't have an i386 to try it on.
Enjoy,
