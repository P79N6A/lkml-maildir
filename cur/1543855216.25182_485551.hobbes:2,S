All the data below doesn't point to the culprit.  
I also have this, and I'd bet the common point is going to be an M$ 
wireless mouse like I have.  The mouse works ok as near as I can tell, so 
I'm not sure of the exact cause.
To verify, unplug the receiver for that mouse, wait 5secs, and plug it 
back in, which if thats it should move the mouse, and the log message to 
a higher number on the usb tree.
Also, FWIW dear lkml readers, my logs have been contaminated with this 
since about a year ago, running kernel.org kernels on an FC2 system, but 
using the latest FC6 non-xen kernel.
