That's just an example. It could be any other sensitive information,
including kernel state that you don't want to reveal to users.
I think it's a reasonable assumption that one can speak freely in a
printk message. Avoiding to print anything that may possibly contain
sensitive information is likely to make messages less useful, just
think of all the data revealed in an oops.

Yes, a bit odd. Maybe because of "intelligent" cards that implement
the signalling in firmware. Anyway, this is an entirely different
issue.
