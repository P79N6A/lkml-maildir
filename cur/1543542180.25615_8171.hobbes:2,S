You need queue ordering on the signal

Its sent to whoever you set to be signalled on that fd. 
The problem is the ordering of queued events versus close/open. You have to
have a single time ordered view in order to resolve the event list
is
	open 5
	close 5
	open 5
	data ready
indicating the data is ready for the first or second user of the fd. Unless you
have a single ordered view of events you have a problem. So we need to keep
stuff queued sensibly. Its the IRQ controller problem, and the two traditional
solutions are
- Given signal goes to a given task
and
- Further signals go to the task that has a signal pending.

SIGSTOP is unmaskable. Its a major and rather unwise change to do otherwise,
then there is SIGKILL which has similar issues.
