> But what to do about DECLARE_MUTEX? :-/
A phased change of just the renames:
	DECLARE_MUTEX ==> DECLARE_SEM
	init_MUTEX ==> init_SEM
	DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED ==> DECLARE_SEM_LOCKED
	init_MUTEX_LOCKED ==> init_SEM_LOCKED
seems doable.  A scripted replacement, so long as it specifies whole
word replacement only, seems to be a very robust replacement for these
four symbols, unlike "up"/"down", which are scary at best to consider
wholesale replacement.
Add the new *_SEM in one release as aliases for the current *_MUTEX,
do the wholesale replacement of the above names, leaving the old as
aliases in a second release, remove the old *_MUTEX aliases in a third
release, and them restore them as new 'real mutex' methods in a fourth
release.  Be sure that the new *_MUTEX versions will generate a compile
error if handed the old counting semaphore type.
I'm a stickler for names ... at least until Linus/Andrew show me
the foolishness of my ways, I could find such a change appealing.
Of course, they're the ones with all the sweat equity on the line,
not me.
... I'd better duck and get back to bug fixing, before I get hit ...
