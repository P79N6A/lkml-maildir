Perhaps their driver contains some IP.  But I seriously doubt the
programming specs for their chips contains such secrets.  It is
not as if we need the entire chip layout - it is basically
things like:
"To achieve effect X, write command code 0x3477 into register 5
and the new coordinates into registers 75-78.  Then wait 2.03ms before
attempting to access the chip again..."
Something is very wrong if they _can't_ release that sort of
information.
Several other manufacturers have no problem with this.

Sure.  But in this case, it is more about common sense than ideology.
