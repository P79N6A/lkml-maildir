But this not case NFS server but NSF client. During this lookups I observe 
rpciod takes 90-99% time of single processor. Load is between 10 and 20.

It is avalaible on Sun pages (Copyright by Sun by it is GPLed):

Few days ago I'm talk about this driver with spot on #aurora channel and 
it was included during prepare next kernel package.
But continue ..
Yesterday before testing NFS I was trying utilize NIC is using only 
ftp/http/rcync/scp and all works correctly (without reporting lookups). 
~23:00 CET after reported series of lookups system hangs completly. After 
restart to now I see in dmesg some known messages:
[root@boss]# dmesg | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 2
      87 svc: bad direction 268435456, dropping request   <==========
     285 hw tcp v4 csum failed
Also I have question about second (hw tcp v4 csum failed):
[root@boss]# ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:03:BA:18:41:F9
           inet addr:153.19.33.230  Bcast:153.19.33.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
           inet6 addr: fe80::203:baff:fe18:41f9/64 Scope:Link
           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1

           Interrupt:192
As you see in both errors is "0". Is this correct reporting broken packets 
in kernel messages instead in RX errors ?
