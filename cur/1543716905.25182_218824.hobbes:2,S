Hi Sam,
Many thanks for your email.
Just having include+scripts in the build directory is sufficient.
Ofcourse this must totally match the kernel installed.
I think this is a workable system provided every Linux 2.6 distributor
ships this stuff when you just install the kernel RPM. So someone needs
to enforce this with all the new Linux 2.6 distributions (we need to
push this issue with OSDL/LSB as well)
The problem currently is that when you install the kernel source RPM,
the /lib/module/<ver>/build is a symlink to that kernel tree but it doesn't
reflect the exact settings/modifications that are in the kernel.
For example, I could be running a AMD K7/GCC 3.3/FOO/BAR kernel
but the kernel sources would reflect a i386/GCC 3.3.1/FOO kernel (with BAR not
configured by default - eg Fedora doesn't show 4KSTACKS in their .config - which
is why we needed vermagic).
So my proposal is that:
1) /lib/modules/<kernel version>/build is a directory (rather than symlink)
2) When you build/install a new kernel, the following is copied over (assuming a
    linux 2.6.6 kernel tree):
	a) the appropriate <asm-ARCH> and <linux> directories from
	   /usr/src/linux-2.6.6/include to the /lib/modules/2.6.6/build directory
	b) /usr/src/linux-2.6.6/scripts to the /lib/modules/2.6.6/build directory.
	c) /usr/src/linux-2.6.6/Makefile and .config to the /lib/modules/2.6.6/build dir.
Now we have a coherent build environment that totally reflects the configured kernel,
the kbuild environment and other kernel related changes in the includes/scripts etc.
We can now use kbuild to build out-of-kernel drivers without needing full kernel
sources.
We will work on this implementation and have something for your review next week.
best regards
Dev Mazumdar
