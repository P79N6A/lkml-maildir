I looked at his patch and he seems to be right. Most of the kmem_cache 
structure is established at slab creation. Updates are to the debug 
counters and to nodelists[] during node online/offline and to array[] 
during cpu online/offline. The chain mutex is used to protect the 
setting of the tuning parameters. I still need to have a look at the 
details though.
