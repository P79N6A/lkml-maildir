I was working on the 2.4 advanced routing & shaping HOWTO, and documenting
the ICMP ratelimiting settings in /proc/sys, and discovered that this
ratelimiting is specified in 'jiffies per packet' - which means that
userspace people need to know HZ in order to configure their kernel
properly.
So userspace *does* need to know HZ, or this interface needs to be rewritten
to use milliseconds, for example.
