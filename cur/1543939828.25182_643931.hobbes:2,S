Please sign off your patches.
Please don't send wordwrapped patches.
Please put the subsystem identifier "memstick" outside [], for reasons
described in 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
Your patch contained a fix which I already merged into -mm, which suggests
that you haven't been testing the code in 2.6.24-rc8-mm1.  Please do test
-mm when you have patches in there, so that we know that we'll be merging
things which work.
Thanks.
