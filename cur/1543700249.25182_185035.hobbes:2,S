I have been trying to get suspend to ram work on Dell
Latitude D600 since 2.6.0-test1. With either
/proc/acpi/sleep or /sys/power, suspend itself works
fine, but
* if plain console is used, the LCD stays off, but the
system is otherwise working fine,
* if vesa/radeon frame buffer is used, resume doesn't
finish and hard reset is necessary to reboot the
machine
I am using latest BIOS (A08). I have tried
with/without preemption, APIC. The following is the
.confg I use.
Thanks in advance.
