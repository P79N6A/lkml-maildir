Andrew, I'm fine with these three patches, specifically:
[PATCH] dont insert pipe dentries into dentry_hashtable.
[PATCH] [DCACHE] : avoid RCU for never hashed dentries
[PATCH] [NET] dont insert socket dentries into dentry_hashtable.
Could you toss them into -mm if you haven't already?  This
makes better sense then me putting it into net-2.6.20 since
it touches FS stuff.
Thanks!
