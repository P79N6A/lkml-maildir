That's how it should be.

Ok, I'll hack up a working v2.1.30 driver for you that works with
v2.2.0final. I'll need it too, anyway, until there's a working version of
the new driver...

The model-id of your PS/2 can be found on the front of the computer. It
should say something like 9556-xxx...
There is another PS/2 56 model; it's 8556. That one doesn't have an SLC2
processor, however.

It works for 8556's, but not for 9556's...
