My concern with that logic is that encourages random, super-wide code
lines that varies with each coder.  You are left to the mercy of he with
the widest text window.
The 80-column rule is good as a general guideline, though there are
obvious exceptions.  Comments IMO are not one of them.  That rapidly
creates unreadable code.
