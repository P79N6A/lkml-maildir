   Which means you miss stuff.
Not my problem Alan.  If the user gives a crap about their report
mattering, they'll do what I ask them to do.  If users send their
report to the wrong place, it will get lost, just like if their
cat their report into /dev/null.  I have no reason to feel bad about
the information getting lost.
If it's too much for them to do as I ask, it's too much for
me to consider their report.
Bug reporting, just like patch submission, is a 2 way street.
