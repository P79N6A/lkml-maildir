   Speaking of acenic - it's broken in 2.4.13-pre. I have 3c985 and all I
   get with 2.4.13-pre is "Firmware NOT running!". After I backed the
   changes from -pre patch it started and works fine. Maybe the problem is
   I have it in 32bit PCI slot?
Do you have CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled?  If so, please try with
it turned off.
Franks a lot,
