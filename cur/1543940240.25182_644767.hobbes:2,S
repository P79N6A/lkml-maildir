So it seems that unplug/plug works fine if the drive was plugged in at 
boot, but if it wasn't plugged in on boot it doesn't work when plugged 
in afterwards. That suggests maybe there is some initialization that the 
BIOS is doing when the drive is plugged in on boot which we're not doing 
when one's plugged in afterwards. Unfortunately the lack of public 
documentation on the NVIDIA SATA hardware makes it difficult to tell 
whether this is the case..
Any ideas guys? When the drive is plugged in, a stream of this shows up. 
It would seem like the controller is throwing hotplug interrupts but we 
never seem to get a "SATA link up". This is on nForce3, btw.
