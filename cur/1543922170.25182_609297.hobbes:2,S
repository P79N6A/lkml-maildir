xf86-input-evdev will never open the console in raw mode and toss the
data, it's not going to happen.
We need a way to, at the absolute minimum, unbind the keyboard from the
text console.  The current solution sucks for things like rfkill.
I'm not convinced that Ryan's fix is any better, but just saying that X
should open the console and ignore the characters is simply not an
option as far as I am concerned for X.
