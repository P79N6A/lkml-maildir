Yes, I have only one processor but I am using the IO-APIC.

Yes.

It halts after saying 'acpi_power_off called'. Strangely, it only breaks when
using the Alt-SysRq-O poweroff function. Shutting down normally still powers
off the system (and does print 'acpi_power_off called'). I think it must have
something to do with the IDE devices not having powered down before
acpi_power_off is called, but I haven't seen the code so I have no idea what
really causes it to break.
