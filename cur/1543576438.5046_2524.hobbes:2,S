It may be - I just did what Al told me without really understanding it ;-)
The test I did initially was the following:
if(!atomic_read(&bh->b_count) &&
	(destroy_dirty_buffers || !buffer_dirty(bh))
	&& ! (bh->b_page && bh->b_page->mapping)
	)
That is, I was explicitely checking for a mapped page. It worked well, too.
Is this more reasonable?
