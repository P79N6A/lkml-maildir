Many of these mods, including this one, came from a non-x86 (PPC I think) developer
to make it work for him. Since I don't have a PPC test machine, I had/have to assume
he knew what he needed. It might work on non-x86, but I don't have a way to test.

The PCI parity scanning and ECC memory harvesting are performed by a single kthread.
No multi-threads are performing these operation. Thus we only have to worry about
the single thread issues.
The iterator will examine all the PCI devices' parity in the system during a scan.
Since each device under examination will have its reference count bumped, it won't
be removed from the list, until the examination passes the device. I had to assume
that the developer was protecting the list during the scan from possible hotplug
events, which could be wrong on my part, as the reference count should do that.
More comments are needed to explain the single harvester model I suppose.  A future
patch will remove the the kthread and utilize a "work queue" model, but that has no
bearing on this issue.
