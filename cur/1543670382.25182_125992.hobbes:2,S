fwiw, my Athlon XP2400 does the same in 2.5.67-ac1:
processor	: 0
vendor_id	: AuthenticAMD
cpu family	: 6
model		: 8
model name	: AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2400+
stepping	: 1
cpu MHz		: 0.000
cache size	: 256 KB
bogomips	: 1970.17
Interesting enough, even the bogomips have halved w.r.t. earlier 2.5.x
kernels and 2.4.2x kernels. Booting a 2.4.21-pre7 kernel on the same
machine gets me close to 4000 bogomips, as is proper for a 2 GHz cpu.
The ioapic code does report the correct bus-speed however.
Ah well, they were bogus to begin with.
