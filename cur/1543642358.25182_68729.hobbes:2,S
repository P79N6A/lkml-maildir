I am not sure; if he gets a busy system in a congested network, i can
see the offloading savings i.e i am not sure if the amortization of the
calls away from the CPU is sufficient enough savings if it doesnt
involve a lot of retransmits. I am also wondering how smart this NIC
in doing the retransmits; example i have doubts if this idea is briliant
to begin with; does it handle SACKs for example? What about
the du-jour algorithm, would you have to upgrade the NIC or can it be
taught some new trickes etc etc.
[also i can see why it makes sense to use this feature only with sendfile;
its pretty much useless for interactive apps]
Troy, i am not interested in the nestat -s data rather the TCP stats
this NIC  has exposed. Unless those somehow show up magically in netstat.
cheers,
