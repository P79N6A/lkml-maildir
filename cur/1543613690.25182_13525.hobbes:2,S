I do not see a hardware minimum fragment size in the HW docs...  The
default hardware reset frag size is 2048 bytes.  So, yes, 32 bytes is
pretty small for today's rate.
But... I wonder if the fault lies more with the application setting a
too-small fragment size and the driver actually allows it to do so, or,
the code following this comment in reorganize_buffers in
drivers/sound/audio.c needs to be revisited:
   /* Compute the fragment size using the default algorithm */
Remember this code is from ancient times...  probably written way before
44 Khz was common at all.
