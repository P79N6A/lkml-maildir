I see what you mean.  IANAL, but I don't think that's how it works.
When your work is not a derived work, the GPL that applies to the rest
of the program does not make you a licensee, and it only covers your
work if you choose to license it that way.  And then, you're the sole
licensor of that piece of the work.
