Lemme clarity myself a bit.  I'm not saying that we should convert all
at once or literally every callback should be converted.  What I'm
saying is whether we're headed that way in general and converting big
ones - timer for example - and getting the conversion agreed upon should
be enough to set the norm.
Thanks.
