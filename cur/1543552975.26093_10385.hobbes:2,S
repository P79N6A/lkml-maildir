This is putrid.  NetWare does 353,00,000/second on a Xenon, pumping out
gobs of packets in between them.  MANOS does 857,000,000/second.  This 
is terrible.  No wonder it's so f_cking slow!!!

ds: and es: are both used in copy-to-user and copy-from-user and they get 
reloaded.

NetWare is here too, and it handles 5000+ file and print users, Linux does not.
Let's fix it.  I know why NetWare is fast.  Let's apply some of the same 
principles and see what happens.  Love to have you involved.
