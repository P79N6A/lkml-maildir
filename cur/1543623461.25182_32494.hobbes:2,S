I think the difference is that he has a 64 bit vaddr space,
and I don't ;-) Thus all mem to him is ZONE_NORMAL (not sure
why he still has a ZONE_DMA, unless he reused it for the 4Gb
boundary). Andrea, is my assumtpion correct?
On a 32 bit arch (eg ia32) everything above 896Mb (by default)
is ZONE_HIGHMEM. Thus if I have > 896Mb in the first node,
I will have one ZONE_NORMAL in node 0, and a ZONE_HIGHMEM
in every node. If I have < 896Mb in the first node, then
I have a ZONE_NORMAL in every node up to and including the
896 breakpoint, and a ZONE_HIGHMEM in every node from the
breakpoint up (including the breakpoint node). Thus the number
of zones = number of nodes + 1.
