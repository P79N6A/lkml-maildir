Subject: 2.3.30,31,32 no longer find my modem... ISAPNP bug?

Hello,
	After upgrading to 2.3.30, the kernel no longer detects my modem
on boot.  I believe 2.3.29 works fine, but I'm using 2.3.25 here:
while 2.3.25 says:
Serial driver version 4.30 with SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI PCI_IOMEM enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
2.3.32-pre2 says:
Serial driver version 4.91 (1999-11-17) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ
SERIAL_PCI PCI_IOMEM enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
It can't find ttyS01, which is my modem.
It is probably worth mentioning that, while 'pnpdump' finds my modem,
/proc/isapnp does not.  My modem did not used to need to be setup, but
here is some 'pnpdump' output:
# Card 2: (serial identifier 00 10 00 28 30 03 00 69 5c)
# Vendor Id WCI0003, Serial Number 268445744, checksum 0x00.

#       IRQ 3.

#             High true, edge sensitive interrupt (by default)
# (INT 0 (IRQ 3 (MODE +E)))
Anyway, given that the modem is not detected on boot, it is not surprising
that 'chat' gives the following error:
Dec 10 07:34:17 telomere pppd[159]: Starting link
Dec 10 07:34:18 telomere chat[332]: Can't get terminal parameters:

thanks,
