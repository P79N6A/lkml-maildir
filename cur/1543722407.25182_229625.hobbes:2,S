Subject: do_gettimeofday( ) precision?

hello,
the comment on top of do_gettimeofday( ) [arch/i386/kernel/time.c] says:
/*
 * This version of gettimeofday has microsecond resolution
 * and better than microsecond precision on fast x86 machines with TSC.
 */
void do_gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv)
{
...
but the code below limits usec to <= 1000000. so isn't the resolution
not limited to microsec even on TSC capable boxes? 
if one wants higher resolution (for timestamping etc.) whats the preferred
way?
thanks
abhijit
