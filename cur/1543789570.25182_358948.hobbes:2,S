Hey everyone...this is my first posting here, and I may not be going about 
this the right way so please forgive me if I am not.  I had a question 
regarding the status of the code for the ImExPS/2 style mice.
I currently have a Nexxtech NXX200 PS/2 Optical Wheel Mouse, running kernel 
2.6.13.4.  I noticed that prior to the 2.6.x.x series (whilst in the 2.4.x.x 
series (I was stubborn)), that my mouse was working fine.
Now, however,if I plug my mouse in, the optical light comes on for perhaps 
half a second, and the mouse goes dark.  The second thing that happens is if 
you click either button, or move/click the scrollwheel, the cursor will go to 
the upper right hand corner of the screen to where you only see a small 
fraction of it.  This happens in both console mode and in graphical.
I have included the results from what dmesg displayed when I connected the 
mouse to the computer, as well as some of the output from /var/log/messages:
input: ImExPS/2 Generic Explorer Mouse on isa0060/serio1

Is this something that is being addressed in the 2.6.14 kernel?  Or is there 
perhaps currently a patch available so that I can use my mouse?  I would 
really not have to go by another one if I can help it.
Thanks in advance,
James
