So every user will see /var/spool/mail. There must be a single mailfsd
for all users.
With private namespaces, every user can run his/her own mailfsd, 
privately mount /var/spool/mail, and run a mailer program to access
one or more IMAP mailbox as /var/spool/mail/<mailbox>. 
But I must say I don't really get the difference in running my own
mailfsd, mounting ~/mail and having the mailer program read IMAP
mailboxes there (OK, /var/spool/mail/<user> is the default INBOX
for many mailers, and some of them don't let you change that... but 
this is a minor issue, just recompile them).
All I need is a private mount point (and privileges to mount on it).
