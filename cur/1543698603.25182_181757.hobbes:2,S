Part of our stackable f/s project (FiST) includes a Gzipfs stackable
compression f/s.  There was a paper on it in Usenix 2001 and there's code in
the latest fistgen package.  See
http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/research/fist/
Performance of Gzipfs is another matter, esp. for writes in the middle of
files. :-)
Cheers,
Erez.
