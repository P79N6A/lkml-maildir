test with writeback and journal a already running. But this will take some
time. as far as i can tell now writeback is really much faster.
The question is, when to use what mode. I would use data=journal on my
CVS-Archive, and maybe writeback on a news-server.
But what to use for an database like mysql ?
Someone mailed me and asked why use a journal for an database ?
Well, I think for speed of reboot after failover or crash.
I don't know if mysql journals data  itself.
