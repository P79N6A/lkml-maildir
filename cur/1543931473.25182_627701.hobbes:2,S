It is not possible to do netif_running() check in generic code as currently
written because of the case of devices where a single NAPI object is
being used to handle two devices. The association between napi and netdevice
is M to N.  There are cases like niu that have multiple NAPI's and one
netdevice; and devices like sky2 that can have one NAPI and 2 netdevice's.
The existing pointer from napi to netdevice is only used by netconsole
now. For devices like sky2 it means that netconsole can't work on the the
second port which is a not a big problem. But adding a netif_running()
check would be a big issue.
