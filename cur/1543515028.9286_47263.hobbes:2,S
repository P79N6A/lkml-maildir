SVGATextMode will allow you to toggle the bits in the VGA setup to turn
off blink mode (which allows you to use high-intensity background
colours).  \033[5m which previously enabled foreground blinking will
then enable high intensity backgrounds.
From /etc/TextConfig on my machine:

# The "16color" option changes the default text console from 8 colors plus

Option "16color"
