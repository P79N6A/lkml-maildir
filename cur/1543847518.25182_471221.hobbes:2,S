Ok. I have added the "cld" early in the setup code. I am still retaining
the call to "cld" just before string instruction to be on the safer side.
Please find attached the regenerated patch.
In the lazy programmer school of fixes.
I haven't really tested this in any configuration.
But reading video.S it does use variable in the bootsector.
It does seem to initialize the variables before use.
But obviously something is missed.
By zeroing the uninteresting parts of the bootsector just after we
have determined we are loaded ok.  We should ensure we are
always in a known state the entire time. 
Andrew if I am right about the cause of your video not working
when you set an enhanced video mode this should fix your boot
problem.
