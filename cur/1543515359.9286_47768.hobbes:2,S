  Hello.
  While reading buffer cache in 2.3.25 I found two things which might be bugs.
1) I think there is an SMP race in getblk() (is it supposed to be SMP safe, isn't it?).
   Processor1: Go through get_hash_table(), create new buffer head and potentialy spend some time on spin locks in
               insert_into_queues()
   Processor2: In the mean time goes through get_hash_table() for the same block and so we'll get 2 buffers for
               one block...
2) When we create buffers heads to cover the page in create_empty_buffers() we don't insert them to LRUs - we just
   set b_list to BUF_CLEAN. I think we should also insert the buffers as they will get to the LRUs anyway -- at
   least after the first mark_buffer_dirty() and I feel its cleaner (when b_list is set...). Or is this intended behaviour?
											Honza.
