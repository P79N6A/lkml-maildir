Hello Mathieu,

One of the main thing we have to figure out before I modify this is if we want to have the generic version of markers available in a "forced" manner at the marker site with the GEN_MARK macro instead of the MARK macro (this is the actual implementation). It has proven to be useful to instrument lockdep.c irq

I must admit that I'm unsure about the use of different marker macros.
How about bitwise flags that could be coded as part of the marker
at the marker site? Something like "MARKER_TYPE_FORCED". This would
still allow some form of toplevel control at the macro definition.
Otherwise there's some digging to be done on a per-marker
basis ...
