Freepages.* is a global counter, that's why I think we should have a
per zone freepages.*. For 2.3, atomic highmem allocations are not an
issue (almost), so that leaves atomic dma and normal requests. On a
machine with a lot of free normal memory, the number of free dma pages 
might be running low, but that will not trigger kswapd, since 
nr_free_pages() will give an aggregrate sum, which will seem fine
to kswapd when compared to freepages.*.
Okay, if that is believable logic for a zone-aware kswapd (and per zone
freepages.*), the per zone freepages.* can be rolled into how the zone 
pages_low/pages_high etc values are setup when the zone is initialized.
