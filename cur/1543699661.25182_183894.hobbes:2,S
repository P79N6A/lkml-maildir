I'd have to agree, it would require OR'ing with irqs_disabled(). And
another addendum would be that in_interrupt() also returns true when in a
softirq handler.

I think he could also add that local_irq_disable() also disables
preemption implicitely.
User Context
The kernel executing on behalf of a particular process (ie. a system
call or trap) or kernel thread. You can tell which process with the
current() macro.) Not to be confused with userspace. Can be interrupted by
software or hardware interrupts.
Small nit, it's 'current'
