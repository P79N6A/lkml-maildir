I am running 4.3.0 (part of SuSE Pro 8.2) and I have also grabbed the
GATOS drivers to get a better driver. The interesting thing about that
was that the GATOS project provide drm code to build new kernel drm
drivers, and when installing the radeon.o from that build, when I
started X I had a hard hang. Could do nothing but hold down the
powerbutton until the thing switched off, about 8-10 seconds..
