Got it.
Global ldisc array refcount is used to know
when an ldisc module can be unloaded.
Per tty ldisc refcount is used to know
when an ldisc can be switched.
The problem is that the per tty ldisc structure is being
initialized with the global ldisc array entry
including the global refcount.
So the per tty refcount starts non zero and
never goes to zero and can't be changed.
The per tty ldisc refcount must be initialized to zero 
after copying the global ldisc structure.
There are 6 places where this needs to be done:
3 in tty_set_ldisc
2 in release_dev
1 in initialize_tty_struct
Also:
Switching back to N_TTY ldisc in release_dev() of tty_io.c
takes a global ldisc reference (tty_ldisc_get) but
then frees the tty structure. This causes a reference
leak (global ldisc refcount) on N_TTY because there
is no corresponding tty_ldisc_put.
