Where possible ACPI does still use tables. For more complicated
configuration, ACPI uses easily-decompiled bytecodes. I think if the
graphics bios provided arch-neutral AML for doing all this
mode-setting stuff we'd be better off. Better than interpreting x86
real-mode BIOS code!

You have to get a priori information about the system somewhere. With
ACPI at least it's not a complete mystery what the BIOS is doing,
unlike these video BIOSes.
