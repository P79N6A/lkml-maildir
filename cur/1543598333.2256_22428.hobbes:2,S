We have a single layer between the network stack and the drivers. However
nothing stops drivers from implementing multiple layers internally or
calling back into other drivers. shaper is an example of a driver that
calls other drivers.
The basic attitude is layering is slow, and generally poor for the cache
behaviour. You want to do a single pass of the packet (or less if possible
when using DMA). However the interface is flexible and if a driver wants
to be layered or has reason for it - sure it can do it internally
