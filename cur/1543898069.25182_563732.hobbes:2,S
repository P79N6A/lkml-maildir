Remember you have to support _both_ 32-bit and 64-bit system calls. You
need to define struct compat_pps_info and struct compat_pps_params, and 
you'll have to provide a compat wrapper for sys_time_pps_getparams() and
sys_time_pps_setparams(). You'll also need to extend your
compat_sys_time_pps_fetch() wrapper to handle the struct pps_info too.
