Ok, I understand this now. Thanks.
More disturbingly, I notice in the same image that the strings that
are printk'd in the macros from include/linux/time.h seem to be
occuring quite a lot.
The comment in this file says that the macros are only a temp measure
whilst the new waitqueue code is debugged, but can't these macros be
changed to use 1 copy of each string?
Regards,
d.
