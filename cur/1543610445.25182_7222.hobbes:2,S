One of the regression tests for gcc is to compile *a* Linux kernel, although
I have no clue which kernel they use, or if they just haul down the latest one
from the Internet.

I haven't seen it on RH 7.x; I had to download and install it separately. And
it is a *royal* pain to get all the symbols/paths/libraries, etc., correct if
you want to use *anything* other than the default compiler/libraries/binutils
with Red Hat.  One would need extreme motivation and extreme care.
For you (fellow) Athlon geeks, 2.95.x generates better code than either 2.96.x
or 3.0.x on the Atlas high-speed numerical linear algebra library. The reverse
is true for IA64; 3.0.x is about the only thing that generates decent code. If
that's motivating enough, have at it. YMMV.
