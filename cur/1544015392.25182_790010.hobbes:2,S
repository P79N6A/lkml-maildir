Looking at this more closely, it seems it would be better to per_cpu_alloc
the legacy kstat_irqs as that would place the value being incremented on the
node of the cpu doing the incrementing. 
This, of course, would need the early per_cpu_alloc (in bootmem) that
the new cpu_alloc changes from Christoph and Rusty is providing.
Thanks,
