Huh? Unless you mean ppc64, ppc is worse.
On a Mac, you get 2 GB of virtual memory per
process. You get up to 512 MB of physical memory
without highmem support, or usually 4 GB with
highmem support. As with x86, the latest chips
offer a 36-bit (64 GB) physical address space.
Virtual memory layout:
00000000-7fffffff user
80000000-bfffffff waste (for IO on obscure Amiga "upgrade" junk)
c0000000-dfffffff non-paged mapping of 512 MB at phys addr 0
e0000000-ffffffff IO, vmalloc(), etc.
That's not all! Linus recently singled out the PowerPC
MMU for a nice long abusive rant. :-) You get hashed
page tables. You get this:
As with x86, segment registers map a 32-bit virtual
address space onto a larger one. The top 4 bits of
a 32-bit virtual address are used to select a segment,
and the segment provides 24 more address bits to
give you a 52-bit virtual address. Eeeew.
