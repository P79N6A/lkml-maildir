the same way user space knows that system call is (not) implemented.
(include unistd.h :))) )

Do you state that glibc describes _all_ the existing system calls with some wrappers?

currently it is done with a single file read.
you can grep it, sum up resources or do what ever you want from bash.
what is important! you can check whether container hits its limits
with a single command, while with configs you would have to look through
20 files...
IMHO it is convinient to have a text file representing the whole information state
and system call for applications.

it is not the question of performance...
