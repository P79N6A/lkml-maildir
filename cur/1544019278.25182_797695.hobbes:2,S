Absolutely. There is no 100% fit solution here. Heck, if we want to remove 
the tunable altogether I'm the happiest one, but the problem with the 
pinneable memory is there.
We can decide to remove the caps in the default setup, and leave default 
setups open to the DoS. I've no problem with that (and, as we know, I 
don't decide policies).
Then sysadmins of multiuser systems will have to enforce the caps 
themselves in order to limit the potential DoS. This is probably a good 
strategy for -stable anyway.
