Thanks for your response.
I just want to know if my understanding of how the sk_buff structure is
correct.
When data arrives at the TCP layer it is pointed to by the data pointer
and the TCP header goes in the skb->data-skb->head area. When this packet
is passed to the IP layer, skb->tail-skb->data section will now contain
the TCP header + TCP data and now the IP header will be put in the new
skb->data-skb->head area.
Please let me know if this understanding is correct.
I also wanted to know does psk_may_pull() only check for correct header
length or does it (thought some func calls) strip off the IP header ?
Thanks,
Rahul.
