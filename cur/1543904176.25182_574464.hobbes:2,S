Hi,
Egmont got some UTF-8 fixes in mainline, Andrew Morton suggested it
might be a good time to remember about bug 7746 Support for unicode dead
keys: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7746
 :
« Quoting a mail from Vojtech Pavlik:
"Several languages (polish, czech, slovak, ...) use dead keys (keys that
don't do anything per se, but put an accent on the next letter). And
now almost everyone is switching to unicode. And Linux kernel doesn't
support unicode for dead keys. This means trouble."
(full mail at
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0405.3/1387.html
)
And indeed, see 
http://bugs.debian.org/404503
There is a more recent patch proposed on
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.2/1723.html
Is there any objection to the proposed way? (extending the internal
type, and add a new ioctl for uploading unicode dead keys). »
