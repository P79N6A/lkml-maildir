No, but you're not emphasizing the ":-(" at the end of the paragraph
above. The idea that to use specific Jaz drive commands I need to
"insmod jaz.o" strikes me as a reversal of one of the boldest triumphs
and biggest differences between Windows and most Unixen.
The fact that we have *SCSI* and *IDE* drivers, and not Seagate,
Iomega, Adaptec etc. drivers is something we should not be
contemplating abandoning.
So, sure, protect the whole or some portion of the sg drivers with
CAP_SYS_RAW, but don't think that its still Unix if you have to
install a device-specific driver for each device that uses a standard
protocol.
