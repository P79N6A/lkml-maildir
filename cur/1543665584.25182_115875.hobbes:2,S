You're right, but you still don't win the stuffed poodle.
I put forth the same argument at last year's kernel workshop and was 
overruled on the grounds that, let me see:
  - Duplicates as a result of unlinks are one thing, duplicates as a
    result of creates are another, worse thing.
  - Creating one duplicate as a result of one unlink is one thing,
    creating lots of duplicates with one operation is another, worse
    thing.
  - The rules are written to allow this particular duplicate behavior
    in UFS (design inherited by Ext2/3) because at the time, UFS was
    the only game in town.
The phrase "broken by design" comes to mind.  Ted and Stephen would no doubt 
be happy to elaborate.  Anyway, there's another reason we need to return 
results in hash order, and that is telldir/seekdir, which expects a stable 
enumeration of a directory with no duplicates, even with concurrent 
operations going on, and even if the server is rebooted in the middle of a 
directory traversal.  Not just broken by design, but smashed to pieces by 
design.  And we still have to make it work, for some definition of "work".
Anyway,
