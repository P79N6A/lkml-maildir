Hi,
the problem is, that Donald diverted in his drivers from the "official
stance" by introducing a pci-layer which he uses in all his
drivers. To him, at that time, it was technically superior to the
(then existing) PCI code and after he created this layer, he no longer
cared about the ongoing Linux PCI development because he wanted to
keep his drivers stable and laid the emphasis not on "keeping up with
every PCI change in a minor kernel revision" but to keep his drivers
stable.
You can't simply take Donalds' drivers and drop them into the
kernel. You need at least the pci-scan.c file and even then you might
either not get it to work or have to make code changes. BTDTGTT.
But you do have to start somewhere. If Jeff drops the drivers into the
source in a way that they compile and work even if they don't adhere
to every linux kernel programming standard (which seem to be chiseled
in jelly anway...)  and after that start converting with Donalds' help
to the actual PCI core code, that's IMHO the right way to go.
But if one gets shot down for even trying to start this, you might
(after a while) drive developers away from the kernel source (just as
it did happen with Donald).
I considered the ChangeSet which included pci-scan.c as a start and a
peace offer to Donald. Too bad, that not all core developers seem to
be as understanding and ready to make an admission as Jeff.
 	Regards
