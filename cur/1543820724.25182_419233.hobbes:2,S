I'm now booted to 2.6.16.11, and here, from my buildit script, is the 
list of patches used, most of them simply saved to /usr/src from this 
list:
VEROLD="linux-2.6.16.9"
# This is the src file to be used
VERSRC="linux-2.6.16"
# These are the patchfile(s) to be used
VERP1="../patch-2.6.16.3"
VERP2="../patch-2.6.16.3-2.6.16.4"
VERP3="../patch-2.6.16.5"
VERP4="../patch-2.6.16.6"
VERP5="../patch-2.6.16.7"
VERP6="../patch-2.6.16.8"
VERP7="../patch-2.6.16.9"
VERP8="../patch-2.6.16.10"
VERP9="../patch-2.6.16.11"
They are applied in the above sequence further down in the script, and 
they are all error free in application, and now in running that kernel 
too.
[root@coyote src]# uname -r
2.6.16.11
Anyplace you are using a bz2, replace it with the .gz version and see if 
you still have the problem.  I'm not betting one way or the other, but 
it sure tastes like it to me.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
