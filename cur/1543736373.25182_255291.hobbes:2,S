how can a page be sent to swap if sys_swapon refuses to run? The whole
point of avoiding running mkswap is to forbid sys_swapon to run.

or also if you mkswap on the whole device without partitions.
doing crypto-swap with cryptoapi inside the swap layer (without using
cryptoloop and dm-crypt) with a transparently randomly choosen password
and the metadata written in cleartext sounds just a lot cleaner and
safer.
