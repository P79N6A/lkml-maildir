Yep, this is correct. Probably i should've mentioned that in the preamble. It
is rather confusing, imho, when sending only a subset of the patches. Rather,
I should've sent the whole series after tagging the ones already applied so
that you have an idea about their ordering. Will note that for the next time.

Will do the whole driver testing in the weekend. :)
