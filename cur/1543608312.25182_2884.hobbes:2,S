I'm using these dirty tricks often. Too often in fact, it hurts readability
and violates "make it simple if you can" principle.
Look at this diff of "simple" and "optimized" version:
-unsigned long jiffies = INITIAL_JIFFIES;
-unsigned long jiffies_hi = 0;
+/* vda: need to enforce 8 byte alignment - how??? */
+#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN) && (BITS_PER_LONG == 32)
+	unsigned long jiffies = INITIAL_JIFFIES;
+	unsigned long jiffies_hi = 0;
+#elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN) && (BITS_PER_LONG == 32)
+	unsigned long jiffies_hi = 0;
+	unsigned long jiffies = INITIAL_JIFFIES;
+#elif (BITS_PER_LONG == 64)
+	unsigned long jiffies = INITIAL_JIFFIES;
+#else
+#error Fix me somebody please....
+#endif
...
+	if(++jiffies==0) jiffies_hi++;
+#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN) && (BITS_PER_LONG == 32)
+	(*(unsigned long long*)&jiffies)++;
+#elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN) && (BITS_PER_LONG == 32)
+	(*(unsigned long long*)&jiffies_hi)++;
+#elif (BITS_PER_LONG == 64)
+	jiffies++;
+#else
+#error Fix me somebody please....
+#endif
Does saving 600 CPU cycles per second (0.000001 of your CPU power)
worth this mess?
I think not. Let's hope gcc will get smarter some day :-)
