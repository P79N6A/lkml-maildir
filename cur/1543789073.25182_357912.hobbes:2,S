The problem remains that all threads spin with TIF_SIGPENDING flag
after the coredumping thread sets SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT in do_coredump()
and before it kills them in zap_threads(). If one of these threads is
SCHED_FIFO we have a deadlock. Also, the coredumping thread could be
preempted, placed in ->expired array ...
