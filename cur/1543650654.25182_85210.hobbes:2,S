I'm just looking over the new arch/parisc/Kconfig trying to make sure that
it got translated correctly, but I can't find any documentation.  Some of
the Kconfig files refer to "the Configure script" -- what Configure
script?  Some of them refer to Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt
-- which describes the old one.  Most don't tell you where to find
the description.
What's the difference between `help' and `---help---'?
What's the new idiom for define_bool?
