Hi, Paul,
I have run into a problem running this patch on a powerpc box. Basically,
the machine panics as soon as I mount the container filesystem with
mount -t container -oall container /<mount point>, I see
cpu 0x2: Vector: 300 (Data Access) at [c0000001e7f2b8e0]
    pc: c000000000098b70: .cpuacct_charge+0x84/0xbc
    lr: c000000000060a3c: .account_user_time+0x60/0xb4
    sp: c0000001e7f2bb60
   msr: 8000000000009032
   dar: 48
 dsisr: 40000000
  current = 0xc0000001e7f0e800
  paca    = 0xc00000000071c300
    pid   = 0, comm = swapper
Analyzing the dump a bit further lead me to container_subsys_state().
I am trying to figure out the reason for the panic and trying to find
a fix. Since the introduction of whole hierarchy system, the debugging
has gotten a bit harder and taking longer, hence I was wondering if you
had any clues about the problem
