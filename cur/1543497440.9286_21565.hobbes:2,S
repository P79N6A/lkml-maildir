It isn't a lockup problem. The mail I replied to was about oom() possibly
killing the init process. I believe I saw this happen with an early 2.2.0,
I haven't tried provoking it again.
I'm going to try a clean 2.2.9 first, then this patch, then 2.3.4-pre2,
then pre-2.3.4-2-andrea2 ...
(but I'll have to wait for this evening since people depend on the
machine in question being up during the day :)
I don't know how easy it will be to reproduce init being killed, I
remember it as very easy to get oom.
Do you still think it is a problem/the same problem?
If you thought it was a lockup (== everything stops working) and has a
patch for that ...
