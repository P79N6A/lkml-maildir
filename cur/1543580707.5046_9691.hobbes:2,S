Not me, Linus says that glibc is wrong.
  "I've asked glibc maintainers to stop the symlink insanity for the
  last few years now, but it doesn't seem to happen.
  Basically, that symlink should not be a symlink.  It's a symlink for
  historical reasons, none of them very good any more (and haven't been
  for a long time), and it's a disaster unless you want to be a C
  library developer.  Which not very many people want to be.
  The fact is, that the header files should match the library you link
  against, not the kernel you run on."

for the rest of Linus's reasons.
