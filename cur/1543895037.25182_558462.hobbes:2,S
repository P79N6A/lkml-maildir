It would need to know a lot about the RAID geometry in order not to put
the the copies on the same disks.

You'd need a reverse mapping of extents to files.  While maintaining
that is expensive, it brings a lot of benefits:
- rebuild a failed drive, without rebuilding free space
- evacuate a drive in anticipation of taking it offline
- efficient defragmentation
Reverse mapping storage could serve as free space store too.

It's a step forward, but still quite limited compared to combining the
two layers together.  Sticking with the example above, you still can't
have a mix of parity-protected files and mirror-protected files; the
RAID decides that for you.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
