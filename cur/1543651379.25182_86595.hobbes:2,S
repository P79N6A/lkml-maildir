It's definitely not. The current solution is simply a denial of service
attack, at moment Qt is _required_ for a build, not an optional frontend:
[0]--(16:26:00)-(root@stefan)-(/.localvol000/src/kernel/x/linux-2.5.45)-> make oldconfig
*
* Unable to find the QT installation. Please make sure that the
* QT development package is correctly installed and the QTDIR
* environment variable is set to the correct location.
*
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/.tmp_qtcheck] Fehler 1
make: *** [scripts/kconfig/conf] Fehler 2
[2]--(16:26:05)-(root@stefan)-(/.localvol000/src/kernel/x/linux-2.5.45)-> 
This should not happen. Anyway, Roman did a good job.
