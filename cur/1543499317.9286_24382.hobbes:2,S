Correction. I _have_ been able to reproduce the problem with 2.2.5-22. It
is not as predictable as 2.2.10, however.
Digging further, I have compiled a stock 2.2.4, without SCSI support at all. 
I couldn't reproduce the problem immediately, but will do further testing.

The kernel debug patch you mean is the one by Scott Lurndal that can be
found at 
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/,
 right?
The latest patch there was for kernel 2.2.4, but as I could not reproduce
the problem reliably with that kernel, I've updated the diff file to work
on a stock 2.2.10. It is attached, maybe it can be useful to someone else.
It works for me.
What exactly do you want me to do with the kernel debugger? 
Ward.
