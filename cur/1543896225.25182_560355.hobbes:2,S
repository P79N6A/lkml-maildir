I tried to make it as simple as possible. The patch is primarily useful as 
a debugging aid since it eliminates the lower layers from the game. I 
think ramfs should be left as is sine it is intended as a minimal 
implementation that should stay simpl.
If we really want such an option for good then it may best be added to 
shmem or ramdisk drivers?
