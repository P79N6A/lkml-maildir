Just for reference here's my 2+ years old Asus A4K, kernel is form
Debian Etch:

Apart from diff in hardware and implied designing/coding skills, decision
was made
* after one "wrong" response plus illness from Con,
* brave core-duo by Ingo and Tomas, who made some bunch of students to test
  scheduler and reported success to Linus.
I don't know why, after all that variety of things (mostly drivers, but
recent *fd also) there's such big resistance to anything that's useful
and used by ordinary people. A star sickness, pride? If yes, that's just
ridiculous, but who cares.
