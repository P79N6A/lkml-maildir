Alessandro,
Hi, I am a software engineer from China. The company, for which I served, want me to develop the Linux mouse driver for the Company's product--Genius Netscroll mouse. The aim is to implement the scroll function in Linux (as in MS Windows).
As I got to the Linux for only 20 days, I find I have many problem . Knowing your name from the MAINTAINERS, I venture to ask you some questions. I wish they will not destroy your patience.
1. In Linux, is there a certain driver associated with each item in the "Mouse Configuration" of "setup". In other words, for a certain mouse, is there an corresponding program (source codes)? I have searched for "Generic Mouse (serial)", however no result. I doubt whether serial mouse is included in "serial.c".
2. In "Mouse Configuration" of "setup", there is an item "Genius Netscroll (PS/2)". For testing the Netscroll mouse, I selected it. However, the mouse can not work well, especially in X-Windows. So, what's wrong?
3. Here are a serial of questions:
3.1 Whether Linux supports the scrolling function of the mouse? I can not find where it exists.
3.2 If the answer to '3.1' is "no", could you tell me if we shall add this new function.
3.3 If the answer to '3.2' is "yes", please tell me the steps & operations.
4. At the last, I want to join some mailing-list or newsgroup, e.g. 
linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu but I do not know how to join . Could you teach me?
As a mail "copy to" the mailing-list, if someone else is interested in it and answer me, I am also grateful to him.
Thanks a lot.
