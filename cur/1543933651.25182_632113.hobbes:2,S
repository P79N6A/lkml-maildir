That one did not work out so well.
I reenabled the call to pci_enable_crs() and changed the line as above.
That resulted in two timeouts (from dmesg):
[....]
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
ACPI: Using IOACPI for interrupt routing
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
Device 0000:01:00.0 not responding
Device 0000:02:00.0 not responding
[....]
Then, the kernel boots up normally except of graphics and network card
not showing up at all in lspci.
