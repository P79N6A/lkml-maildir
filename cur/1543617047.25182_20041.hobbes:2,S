      ^^ actually mini-ll
right (I was still in the middle of the backlog of my emails, so I
didn't know he just produced the mini-ll+O(1)). The mini-ll+O(1) shows
that -preempt is still a bit faster (as expected not much faster
anymore). The reason it is faster it is probably really the sum of few
usec latency of userspace cpu cycles that you save. However given the
small difference in numbers in this patological case (-j1 obviously
cannot take advantage of the few usec less of reduced latency) still
makes me to think it doesn't worth the pain and the complexity, or at
least somebody should also proof that it doesn't visibly drop
performance in a 100% cpu bound _system_ (not user) time load (ala
pagecache_lock collision testcase with sendfile etc..), in general with
a single thread in the system.
