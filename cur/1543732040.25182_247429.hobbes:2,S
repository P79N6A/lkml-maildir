There are indeed all sorts of other retries in various layers, the
worst one when the kernel tries to read-ahead a couple of blocks on an
IDE disk(1). You can work around them with raw IO or O_DIRECT.

And many others do not. CompactFlash readers are usually implemented as
a USB storage device, which on its turn is implemented as a SCSI
"disk". So far I haven't seen a CompactFlash which could be "fixed" by
retries.
iSCSI appliances can also make things worse: when the target machine is
implemented as a simple "pass everything to the real SCSI disk" device,
it's not really different from a directly connected SCSI disk. However,
when the iSCSI target interprets the SCSI commands and has its own way
to deal with bad blocks (i.e.: it retries the blocks), things can get
very bad when the kernel also uses a couple of retries.
In my experience it would be good if the IDE disk driver would behave
like the SCSI disk driver: no retries on a bad block. I agree that it
would be a good idea to make it configurable through the block layer to
avoid code duplication (blockdev --getretries/--setretries).

(1) Imagine an application doing a linear read on a file with an 8
block read ahead and the last block being bad. The kernel will try to
read that bad block 16 times, but because the IDE driver also has 8
retries, the kernel will try to read that bad block *64* times. It
usually takes an IDE drive about 2 seconds to figure out a block is
bad, so the application gets stuck for 2 minutes in that single bad
block.
