.. or fix all registration functions to use a private copy of the string,
which would avoid some common oopses.

I dislike init_printk;  it combines variadic functions/macros with
assumptions about how the first argument is specified (i.e. as a string
constant), so it's potentially very confusing.
Also, printk is used for debugging, and accidentally using init_printk
instead of printk would result in no messages being printed at all if
the driver is compiled into the kernel (while everything would work
fine if the driver is compiled as a module, where init_printk and printk
are identical).  I think this would be very annoying to track down for
less experienced kernel hackers.

I think this would fail if used in structure initialisations ?
