If you've ever seen how SuSE patched the ISDN code into their 6.1
distribution (2.2.5), you wouldn't want to have them do it EVER again.
This is just my opinion. I ended up installing Debian (with 2.0.36) on
three different servers because there it just worked right out of the box.
Maybe I was just too dumb (but even the support by email and phone couldn't
help me out there...).

I don't understand how the ISDN patch could put the rest of the kernel at
risk if you don't compile it in. Let the default setup NOT compile the ISDN
Stuff in, or perhaps as a module, and everyone will be happy. but put it in
the default kernel: that will save a HUGE lot of work for many people,
getting the right CVS versions, compiling, patching, getting isdnutils,
compiling, etc etc etc ...

Hm. I am running 2.2.9 here with no problems whatsoever. I don't intend to
change until 2.4 if things stay that way... but maybe I'm just lucky. :)

Sure, but a lot of people would rather wait a couple more weeks and get
ISDN included than the other way round. At least, in Europe.
Just my 0.02¢.  :)
