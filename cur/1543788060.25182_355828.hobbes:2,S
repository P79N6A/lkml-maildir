My current Kernel hacking section:

# Kernel hacking

# CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME is not set
# CONFIG_PRINTK_IGNORE_LOGLEVEL is not set
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=17
# CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP is not set
# CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is not set
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_FLAGS=y
# CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE=y
# CONFIG_CRITICAL_PREEMPT_TIMING is not set

# CONFIG_RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT is not set

# CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is not set

# CONFIG_INIT_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_KPROBES is not set
I'll build this way for now. Send back some info on what you think I
need to turn on. I'm using make menuconfig. Maybe that's the problem?
Thanks,
Mark
