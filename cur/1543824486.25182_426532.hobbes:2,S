Hi,
I'm building an application which requires me to determine the
bandwitth between two nodes.
Now I'm using the formulat BW = (max segment size/rtt) * 1/sqrt(packet loss)
But this requires me to determine the packet loss and the RTT, and to
do that I use ping. Now ping really slows down the entire calculation.
Is there a more faster way to determine the bandwidth between nodes??
Regards
Irfan
