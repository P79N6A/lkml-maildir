Hi,
	pci/quirks.c in Linux 2.4.4 contains the latency patch for the VIA 
686B southbridge. However the line 315 in the file reads:
        { PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,      PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,      PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8363_0
,       quirk_vialatency },
	Doesn't this only activate the patch on KT133 boards and not on AMD760
boards for example that use the 686B southbridge as well? So shouldn't be
PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686 (I don't know the correct ID for the 686B chip)  
placed there instead? Is this correct?
Bye
Oliver
