I did a "mkfs" on a "md" of 3 8-disk "md"s (24 disk md).  So no
lock contention, and only one "dev" to match, right?  [Try to
avoid the problem.]
getblk was holding the lru_list_lock lock 86% of the time.
Was averaging about 25,000 blocks/sec to the disks (vmstat),
but it was often 200,000 over 2 seconds, then 5 seconds idle,
etc.  Disk lights didn't come on much (but they all blinked
nicely in sync).
I'll try your patch out and run individual disks again.
