Yes, but causing it to overwrite data over random blockdevs when the  
unexpected happens is _not_ OK.

You've obviously never administrated any kind of large scale linux  
lab.  We had so many people just saving files on their USB sticks and  
pulling them that we would daily get people reporting that they  
couldn't _mount_ their USB stick because the last user hadn't  
unmounted it first.  At one point we had to write a Perl script run  
from cron that ran every 10 minutes and verified if USB-stick mounts  
were still good, and if not it forcefully unmounted them.  Now  
obviously this is the kind of behavior that we want to avoid, but end- 
users are bound to do stupid stuff until it comes back and bites them  
at least twice (except on Linux with -o sync mounts it usually  
doesn't).  Think about how most linux distros automatically turn on - 
o sync on USB keys and the like; they do it for precisely this reason.

I described a workable method to handle root-on-USB (and I'm not  
sure, but I doubt it works now).  You would have early userspace find  
your USB filesystems again and pass device information to the  
resuming kernel, which would then restore RAM and then use the passed  
information to attach its filesystems again.
One other alternative that just occurs to me now is to have a special  
stackable filesystem that can suspend all IO and unmount the  
filesystem underneath it then have the filesystem be easily  
reattachable later on (the stackable layer would look up paths again  
on remount.  You would have an mlocked program start during suspend  
that would create a new namespace with a basic tmpfs, procfs, and  
sysfs.  It would be able to rescan all removable devices on resume  
and reattach them to the stackable mounts in the primary namespace  
through /proc/<pid>/root.  This seems to me to be the most race-free  
and most flexible solution.  It will even handle network suspend and  
resume without too much extra effort.
