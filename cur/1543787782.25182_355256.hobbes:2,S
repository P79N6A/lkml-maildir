And I am sure they have reasons for not submitting their
changes to the linux-kernel mailing list.  They probably
know something we (including you) don't know.
Switching out the low level infrastructure does NOT help
with scalability.  The only way to make the kernel more
parallelizable is by changing the high level code, ie.
Linux itself.
Adding a microkernel under Linux is not going to help
with anything you mentioned so far.
