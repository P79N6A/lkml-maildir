Well, I submitted the dmseg and messages because Jamal requested
it (same motherboard, same 4-port card and same strange IRQ
assignments), but this particular machine is not tested with XP,
and I don't think we have that.
I think we still have a disk with Win2000 on it. Would that help?
Should have to wait until tomorrow though, I'm on Central European Time,
and the machine is located elsewhere.
