No.  However, I was responding to your suggestion that supporting
self modifying code in the kernel is trivial.

No.  You also have a big misconception about how we map system memory.
We have 1MB mappings, and replacing 1MB of code/data (which would
equate to half a kernel) would completely negate the whole point of
XIP.
