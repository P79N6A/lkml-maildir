s/replacing/adding/
A new ->direct_IO2 hook would be an addition, so you really want to
simply add another feature flag.
Since the 2.5 direct_IO API is already different from current 2.4, I
would also suggestion considering KERNEL24_HAS_O_DIRECT2 as the name, to
specify the feature is specific to 2.4.
