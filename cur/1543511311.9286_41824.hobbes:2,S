Is there a configuration option for the ESS Solo1 module to allow you to
specify a different IRQ than the default? my ESS seems to default to 11,
but my 3c905B network card also defaults to IRQ 11, and the system doesn't
seem to to have a problem with assigning them both the same IRQ, which
seems to be creating the obvious problems. If anyone doesn't know how to
specify a different IRQ for the solo1 module, perhaps there's a way to do
it with the 3c59x mod? Thanks.
