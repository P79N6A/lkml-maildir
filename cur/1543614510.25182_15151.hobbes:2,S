Hi,
I just compiled 2.4.17 with the patch from your site that looks to be
for 2.4.17-final.  Unfortunately, several modules (e.g. unix.o) fail on
load with an undefined symbol error (preempt_schedule).  FWIW, I also
have the patch that started the recent "Make highly niced processes run
only when idle" thread.  Which reminds me, I'm anxious to try out your
"fixed" version of SCHED_IDLE when it's ready. ;-)
