Well, close. But any low-latency access, even if somewhat buffered,
is likely to be user visible if unresponsive. Clearly that means video
memory like X and DRI, and sound, and mouse. If you define this generally
it would include serial as well, probably not a bad thing.
The proposal to backfeed priority from interractive processes to processes
waking them sounds useful, perhaps that might be limited a bit however.
Someone (Ingo?, Linus?) proposed limiting this to a fraction of the
priority of the interractive process, but it might be more useful to
simply limit how much could be added at one time, perhaps as a fraction of
the delta between max and current interractive bonus, which would have the
waker increase asymptomically toward max. Hysteresis is nice.
I do agree that it would be better to identify processes using physical
devices, far better than trying to identify some subset because it's
obvious.
I think this would include parallel port, although other than PL/IP I
don't think of a case where it matters much.
