Hi,
I get:
drivers/block/block.o: In function `lo_send':
drivers/block/block.o(.text+0xa58f): undefined reference to 
`deactivate_page'
drivers/block/block.o(.text+0xa5f4): undefined reference to 
`deactivate_page'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Is it the same Bug as the
[PATCH] Unresolved symbols in 2.4.14
from Craig Kulesa?
Where can I find the Patch? I didn't find in the kernel-archive the 
original posting from him. Just the answer from Linus Torwalds without 
the patch:-(
