Hm. I do not kill my fsstress.
Here is my version:
#!/bin/bash
mke2fs /dev/hdb2
mount /dev/hdb2 /mnt -t ext2
cd /mnt
/tests/fsstress -p10 -n 1000000 -d . &
while /tests/fsx -c 1234 -N60309 testfile ; do rm -rf testfile*; done

Ok. I am able to reproduce that same thing on dual Pentium4 2.2GHz (HT enabled), 512M RAM.
My testing reveals that 2.5.50, 2.5.52 and 2.5.53 do not have the problem.
2.5.54, 2.5.55, 2.5.59 have the problem.
ext3 and reiserfs do not show this problem.
Looking through 2.5.54, I found that changeset named "[PATCH] quota locking update" forwarded by you
is the cause for the problem.
(also by reviewing the changeset it became clear that in order to succesfully reproduce the
problem one must have CONFIG_QUOTA to be disabled).
This small patch below fixes the problem for me (just reverts back part of quota locking patch in fact).
Also I think that taking BKL just to update some inode accounting stuff is kind of expensive,
so certainly better solution must exist.
