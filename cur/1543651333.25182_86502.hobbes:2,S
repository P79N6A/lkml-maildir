I'm fairly certain that Linus was imagining a pre-compromise
vulnerability assessment scan, not a post-compromise "figure out where
the new holes are" scan, honestly.  (You don't even need to have
directory notifications, if you've got a process that is tormenting you
like that, find can just be setup to not report certain things, etc
etc.)
