Hi
I was wondering if there was any way in linux to use what redmond calls 
"Network Media Detection"?
That is, it detects the presence of a (10BaseT) cable in the back of the 
card.. and then does appropriate stuff (ifup/down, dhcpcd) when the event 
happens.
I remember  having this in W*nME, so can linux use it?
if so can someone please give me some pointers to appropriate sites/howtos on 
how to use it?
Many Thanks
	- Jeff Snyder
