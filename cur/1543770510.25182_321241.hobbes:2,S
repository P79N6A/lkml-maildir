That might be good.  I honestly don't know what would be the best 
solution, but what happens often at the moment is that patches get passed 
on as "From" whatever maintainer (or random resender) happened to pass it 
on to Andrew/Linus and that person then effectively gets labeled as the 
author of the patch in the changelogs/git/whatever. That's not perfect...
Author: might solve it.. worth a shot if you ask me..
