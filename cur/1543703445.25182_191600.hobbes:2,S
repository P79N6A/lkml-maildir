Maybe not - the most common cause I've seen for that message in the logs is trying to access S.M.A.R.T. information when S.M.A.R.T. is disabled.
I.E. the error should be reproducable with:
# smartctl -d /dev/hda
# smartctl -a /dev/hda
Are you sure you weren't trying to get S.M.A.R.T. info from the drive at the time the error was logged?
John.
