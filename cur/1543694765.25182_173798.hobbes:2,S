OK, I misunderstood your statement. I thought you were saying that gunzip
costs nothing !

No, I simply meant that I *observed* consequent gains on this rather limited
platform (it's 33 Mhz, BTW), and I think that if the decompression time is
unnoticeable on it, it will also be on any newer hardware.

I'm not saying that gzip isn't fast enough, and yes the bios takes longer.

I don't want to code it, and never asked you to code it. I stated that this
code already exists, and all that would be needed is its author to agree to
open it. Then if he did, it would even save you some time coding your bzip2
version.

I didn't suggest to code it (since it already exists), but only to study it
among other algos. I'm sorrt you took it for advertisement while it really
was not.

I don't want to fight, you clearly stated that you don't want to hear about
this one. That's OK, period. I can still use upx as I did before if I need.
I repeat, I was only *suggesting* something which already exists, but is not
(yet?) open source.
