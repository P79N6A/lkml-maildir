Yes, partially, i.e. have a look at sys_create_module() and
sys_init_module() system calls, they are in kernel/module.c
sys_create_module() just allocates the space and links the module into the
list but sys_init_module() is passed a 'struct module' from userspace
whose content is harshly validated (trust no one!) and then installed into
a real kernel 'struct module' and module's init_module() routine is
invoked.
