Subject: making kmalloc BUG() might not be a good idea

I'm sort-of concerned about this change:
    [PATCH] __kmalloc: Generate BUG if size requested is too large.
it opens a can of worms, and stuff that used to generate
-ENOMEM kinds of failures will now BUG() the kernel.
Unless you're going to audit every user triggerable
path for proper size limiting, I think we should revert
this change.
Thanks.
