I agree. This is an interface Samba can live with I think. I
was thinking of implementing it anyway, just so I could piss
off the Linux kernel developers by saying "oh if you need proper
Windows semantics on Samba you have to use an advanced OS like
Solaris, Linux doesn't cut it" :-) :-).

Yep - they're different from xattrs. The easiest way to remember
this is that file streams are seekable and get a fd, xattrs aren't
and don't :-).
