    I know. All in a good time (if I have it :-)...

    Erm, simplex stuff shouldn't be touched at all since the chip is not 
DMA-capable. The same should be true about the native/legacy mode...

    Hm, as I can see, it avoids touching anything at all on MPIIX. This may 
rather be said of PIIX -- this chip didn't have SIDETIM register yet, so slave 
tuning won't work on it...

    Of course it doesn't, because of the non-standard timing reg.
    BTW, piix_tune_drive() "forgets" to actully set the speed for drive and... 
setting UDMA modes affects PIO timing for absolutely no reason and ... all in 
all, the tuning code here is BAD.

    There's no great need in splitting, just the separate tune_chipset() 
functions for PIIX/MPIIX and the rest of the crowd would suffice, IMHO...
