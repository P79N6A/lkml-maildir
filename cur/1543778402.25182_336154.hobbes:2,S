yes.  but when you run into a serious addressing shortage (like the
internet does with ipv4), you develop something that provides more
addresses (such as ipv6).  That's why support for more groups than 32
(per family) is something that should be put in the netlink protocol.
I totally agree that we need a higher-level api on top of that, in order
to hide the details of the networking stack for those not interested in
it.
