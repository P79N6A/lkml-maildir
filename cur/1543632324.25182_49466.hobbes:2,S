I've been running 2.5.16+akpmhacks on my desktop (10 days uptime!).
Two impressions:  It's a bit swappy (it's basically the 2.4.15 VM,
so no surprises there).
But it's also quite markedly sluggish in the user interface when the
machine is compiling stuff.
While running a kernel build (-j0) and leaning on the spacebar in 
an X application I see occasional pauses of tens of keystrokes at
the autorepeat rate.  There was no swapin or out according to vmstat
at the time.   So I'd be suspecting that the interactivity heuristics
in the scheduler aren't working.  Renicing ksoftirqd to -19 doesn't
make any difference.
