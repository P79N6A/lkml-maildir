It's OK. I agree. We can remove the fd from inside the structure and have :
struct epoll_event {
	unsigned short events;
	unsigned short revents;
	__uint64_t obj;
};
int epoll_create(int size);
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents,
               int timeout);
And the lower size of the structure will help to reduce the amount of
memory transfered to userspace. I just saw that adding the extra "obj"
member lowered performance of about 15% with crazy tests like Ben's
pipetest. This because it creates, on my machine, more than 400000 events
per second, and saving memory bandwidth on such conditions is a must. With
the "more human" http test performance are about the same.
