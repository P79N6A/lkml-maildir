Aargh... stupid me !! Well, I told Marcelo that I was not feeling too
good the day I submitted the patch :-) And  I just saw myself that the
netry was missing in the intel_820 stuff also (duh !)
The origin of the problem is that I happen to have an old kernel at home
(RH 7.1 2.4.2) that has no suspend/resume stuff, and this was where I
wrote the original patch, and the rest propagated through the usual
copy/paste way.
I correctly updated a part of the stuff but it's missing in other
places, and since I don't use APM, the problem did not show up. 
However, I am out of fast connection, so I am unable to make a patch
right now. 
If nobody has made it by monday, I'll send the patch
Best regards, and thanks Didier for pointing the problem (and Alan for
*very* quickly seeing what went wrong).
