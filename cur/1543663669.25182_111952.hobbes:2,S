Subject: [PATCH][TRIVIAL] don't let OOM killer kill same process repeatedly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/2/23/74

If a process cannot exit because it's stuck in eg. a driver, it
doesn't make sense to have the OOM killer kill it repeatedly;
that could lead to a hung system.
Instead, kill another process if the first process we tried to
kill hasn't made any move to exit within 5 seconds.  This way
we have a much better chance of recovering the system.
Note: this patch applies without offset to both 2.4 and 2.5,
since oom_kill.c hasn't changed since about 2.4.14...
please apply,
Rik
