There's no need. The equivalent functionality can already be
implemented in userspace.
------
#include <sys/socket.h>
uid_t getpeereuid(int sd)
{
	struct ucred cred;
	int len = sizeof (cred);
	if (getsockopt(sd,SOL_SOCKET,SO_PEERCRED,&cred,&len))
		return -1;
	return cred.uid;
}
------
The same can be done for gid, and even pid.
Yes, Linux rules.
