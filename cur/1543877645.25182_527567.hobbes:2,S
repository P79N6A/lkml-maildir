Yeah, I haven't tried loading random modules but I can imagine this does
happen (what module was it, BTW?)
I used to have a function just like this, but managed to get rid of
it.  
Hmm, perhaps we should have an "int lgread_virt_byte(u8 *)" which does
the pgtable walk and read all in one?  It won't be efficient, but it'll
be more correct and maybe even fewer lines 8)
Thanks for the patch!
Rusty.
