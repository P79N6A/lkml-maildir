It's not just third-party modules. Even the modules in the tree get bitten 
by such brokenness - consider what happens if you compile your kernel 
without support for the filesystem in question but later need to compile 
the module. With the #ifdef there, you'd need to recompile (and reboot) the 
whole thing.
Anything in the kernel image which is dependent on CONFIG_*_MODULE is, as a 
general rule, broken. Sometimes there are justifications for it. Not often, 
though.
