As Peter Zaitcev and others have pointed out, they can use simple
pointer comparisons here on the pci_dev struct.

Well, if the claim is that your suggested changes provide this
"commonality", I totally disagree.  Your changes do no more than
provide hooks where no hooks are needed.  The hooks are there,
and are why we have "sysdata" and all the drivers/pci/setup-*.c
buisness.  If ppc64 cannot fit itself into the drivers/pci/setup-*.c
infrastructure, either fix the infrastructure or concede that "our
stuff is too weird to solve with generic code" and do what sparc64
does with driving it's own PCI probing layer.
