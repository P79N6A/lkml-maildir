Now I understand a bit more. Thank you for your explanation. However, I've
been messing with tasks.h a bit more. 
It looks like my machine will *not* boot if I set NR_TASKS to 4092 (as
instructed), or 4090. However, setting it to 4000 works fine. And, no I
don't have APM configured. I have it permanently switched off as I figure
I can bloody well turn off the monitor 8)

I have seen a new kernel thread in the system that I have not seen before.
This is the kpiod thread. I wonder if I just should try again, and set
NR_TASKS to 4089, and see if it pukes.
BTW, top dies with a message "Too many tasks! HELP!" if I exceed a certain
number of processes. =) Fun. I'm trying to find out what that limit is. 
Cheers,
Alex
