First, note that I am not really a linux developer as my only
contributions to linux are testing.
But it really looks like bsd people are more unhappy with their
licence than linux people.  You can ask linux developers to
keep the bsd licence - and the request is not unreasonable.
Nobody is forced to give back, so some people choose not
to.  Some of these have a "GPL" agenda, some have
a commercial agenda. 
I am sure some developers are willing to "give back" bsd code,
but you can't do anything about those who don't. You don't
want to have code "locked up" with GPL, these developers
don't want their code improvements "locked up" in proprietary products.
So - either you will have to accept the current situation, or
adjust the BSD licence to cope with this.

Taking credit for the works of others is wrong of course,
no matter what licence is involved.

Good points.  But note that the linux community is divided on this,
as on many other issues.  And there is nothing to do about
those who disagree.

My impression is that the actions that started the
debate was an unauthorized (possibly illegal)
change that the linux community also rejected. 
With that problem solved, the debate turned to
gpl/bsd licencing issues.

Clearly, there is the risk of less cooperation.  Or some
kind of licencing scheme that makes sure that code with bsd
origin always can go back into bsd as long as it stays open.
That would solve the problem - if such a scheme is possible.
