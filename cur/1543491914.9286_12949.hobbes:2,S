For what it might be worth, here (i586 UP, egcs-1.1.2, binutils-2.9.1.0.22b
for 2.2.5) I just compiled lynx a few times until I'd got the configuration
right (the compilation of one particular file is an enormous memory hog, it
went some 45Mb into swap over 32Mb RAM) while playing spider(1) under X.
The system was quite responsive. No troubles at all.
