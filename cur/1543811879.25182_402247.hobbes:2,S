Subject: Re: + proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely-cpuset-fix-2.patch added to -mm tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/28/370

With these three patches:
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely.patch
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely-git-nfs-fix.patch
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely-cpuset-fix.patch
the command:
    /bin/fuser -n tcp 5553
kills my kernel very quickly.  This latest time it died with
the swap command failure I mentioned before.  And this command
shows the permission problem (2) that I reported to Eric.
The full output, from command entry to death, is as
follows.  The second '#', near the end, is my shell
prompt returning to me, microseconds before death.
# /bin/fuser -n tcp 5553
