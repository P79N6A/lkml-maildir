I for one would be really really surprised if the execution of an
interrupt isn't treating the BTB specially. If one reads
about CPU validation "exception handling" aka irq handling
is something that is paramount there. Hard to beleve they
would implement software IRQ commands by not just toggling the
IRQ input line of the chip themself. This safes testing.
But it may be as well indeed just "accidental" that system
call gates are implemented on recent ia32 systems by an op code
which belongs to the IRQ handling family...
