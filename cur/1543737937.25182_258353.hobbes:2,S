The 2.4 system Marcelo used did this nicely.. A couple -preX to shove
in new stuff, and a couple -rcX to iron out the bugs. 2.6.x-rc[12]
seem to be similar in content to 2.4.x-pre - little expectaction that
they're actually candidates for release.

Also, please simply rename the last -rcX for the release as Marcelo
does with 2.4. Slipping in new stuff between the candidate and the
release invalidates the testing done on the candidate so someone can't
look at 2.6.9 and say "this looks solid from 2 weeks as a release
candidate, I can run with it today".
