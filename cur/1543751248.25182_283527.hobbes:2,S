The fundamental difference that makes it reliable is that:
1) only the I/O we're throttling against will be considered for the
   wakeup event, which means only clearing PG_writeback will be
   considered eligible for wakeup
   Currently _all_ unrelated write I/O was considered eligible
   for wakeup events and that could cause spurious oom kills.
2) we won't need unreliable anti-deadlock timeouts anymore
