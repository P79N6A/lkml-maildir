there appears to be a limit on how many disks get checked for their label. 
I've got one system where I've got 2xraid cards each with 8 drives on them 
and then another raid card with my boot disk on it.
depending on how I have the two raid cards the boot disk can be anything 
from sdc to sdq, mounting by label works for sdc, but not for sdq.
