Oops.  Anyway I believe you also want to look at include/linux/tty.h
at the screen_info structure.  I believe that is where
all of that information is passed.

Cool.  I haven't used that code in a long time but it is pretty
trivial code to switches to real mode so I don't really doubt it :)

Sounds good.
