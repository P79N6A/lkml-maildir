The latest sched-devel.git tree can be pulled from:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
Lots of scheduler updates in the past few days, done by many people. 
Most importantly, the SMP latency problems reported and debugged by Mike 
Galbraith should be fixed for good now.
I've also included the latest and greatest group-fairness scheduling 
patch from Srivatsa Vaddagiri, which can now be used without containers 
as well (in a simplified, each-uid-gets-its-fair-share mode). This 
feature (CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED) is now default-enabled.
Peter Zijlstra has been busy enhancing the math of the scheduler: we've 
got the new 'vslice' forked-task code that should enable snappier shell 
commands during load while still keeping kbuild workloads in check.
On my testsystems this codebase starts looking like something that could 
be merged into v2.6.24, so please give it a good workout and let us know 
if there's anything bad going on. (If this works out fine then i'll 
propagate these changes back into the CFS backport, for wider testing.)
