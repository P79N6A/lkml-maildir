Subject: [PATCH] Save 8 bytes in __{read,write}_lock_failed...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
   recent bugreport from Chris Rankin pointed out to me
that last jump in both __read_lock_failed and __write_lock_failed
uses 4 byte offset, although 1 byte is enough. It happens
because of __write_lock_failed is .globl, and so gas emits
4 byte offset + R_386_PC32 relocation (should it? I always thought
that only .weak symbols may be overwritten from other file).
   Simple patch below makes SMP kernel 8 bytes shorter.
