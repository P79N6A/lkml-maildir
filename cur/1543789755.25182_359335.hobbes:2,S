FYI, I just merged my changes with -rt13 and everything seems to be
working very smoothly.  I've been running my kernel over an hour without
showing the backward times. I haven't even added the change from cycle_t
to be 64 bits.
So, knock on wood, maybe one of the latest updates fixed the problem. Or
maybe as soon as I hit send, the machine will crash.
I'll keep you all posted.
