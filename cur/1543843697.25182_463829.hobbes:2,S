you raise a new point again (without conceding or disputing the point we 
were discussing, which point you snipped from your reply) but i'm happy 
to reply to this new point too: my suggested API is not "barely usable" 
for static tracers but "totally unusable". Did i tell you yet that i 
disagree with the addition of markups for static tracers?
