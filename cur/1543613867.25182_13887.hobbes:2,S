It is BX-chipset, not exactly sure if this is what is called piix. But I
think so and found this in /proc/ide/pix
                                Intel PIIX4 Ultra 33 Chipset.

I was expecting something above 20MB/s, and thus I wondered about the low
values. Well and when I tried first time, my computer was not really idle
and thus I only got something around 3.5 MB/s.
 
OK, what do I need to compile into my kernel to have the chipset configured
fine? Or do I need any boot-parameters?
Here is an excerpt from my kernel-config:
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING=y
CONFIG_IDE_CHIPSETS=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
everything skipped is just not set.
Thanks, thomas
