Amount of pages reclaimed from swapout_mm() versus amount of
pages reclaimed from caches.
A value that says: "use XX% of my main memory for RSS of
processes, even if I run heavy disk loadf now" would be nice.
For general purpose machines, where I run several services but
also play games, this would allow both to survive.
The external services would go slower. Who cares, if some CVS
updates or NFS services go slower, if I can play my favorite game
at full speed? ;-)

Ideally: Every value that the kernel decides by heuristics,
   because heuristics can fail to get even close to an optimal
   result. 
But this is too much. Some tunables from refill_inactive would be
nice. Also the patch for honouring the soft rss limit is good (is
it in?).
