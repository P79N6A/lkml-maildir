It would have been nice, back in the 2.5.46 timeframe when modules were 
complete reinvented, to have provided a hook by which modprobe could 
have waited until insertion init was complete.
The sleep is a hack indeed, as is the slightly more reliable solution to 
tail the log and look for init messages to appear. Perhaps look for the 
devices in /proc/scsi/scsi or something?
There doesn't seem to be a "right way" for this, particularly if you 
have both warm and cold boots, which may differ by minutes depending on 
disk spin-up already being done.
