You're sure it's inside of the pte_offset_map_lock()?
It's probably this call chain:
        pte_offset_map_lock()
        pte_offset_map()
        pmd_page()
        pfn_to_page()
        __pfn_to_section()
        __nr_to_section()
I'd probably take a hard look at the PMD first to make sure it looks
good.  Then, maybe go through some of the conversions in
pte_offset_map_lock() from that chain and print out each step inside of
smaps_pte_range().  Can you trigger it easily?
