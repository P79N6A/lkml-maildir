Don't be so quick to dismiss the "bad hardware" possibility. It is
really quite common these days. And, some cases of bad hardware are
not detected using simple tests like memtest86. (I'm not sure exactly
what cerberos does, do you have a link for it ?).
My recommandation would be to take a big source tree (say, a bit
bigger than the amount of RAM you have), and run repetitive
tar+detar+diff -ru runs on it for 48 hours or so. If your hardware
runs OK, diff should not report any inconsistencies. I found this test
to be quite reliable to detect hardware problems. If you have several
disk controllers, run one instance of the test on each of
them. Additionally you could run a background task to keep the CPU at
100% - a simple while 1 loop would do.

Of course I think I'm right. If I thought I was wrong, I'd change my mind.
