FreeBSD 5.0 should already have a zero copy for mmapped files and
IMHO it would be worth to have it in Linux 2.6 too.
It would also be very nice to be able to enable zero copy for mmapped files
by a config option.
Many applications use mapped memory to serve lots of small and
medium sized files (4 - 1024 KB) or even a few big files
(think at web servers, i.e. Apache 2, etc.);  this is done to better
serve multiple / parallel downloads being done on the same files.
Using or not using mmap() is a userland / application choice that depends
on lots of factors / strategies that are outside kernel scope.
Besides this there seems to be some work in progress to speed up
mmap() calls, thus why not doing all the work right ?
