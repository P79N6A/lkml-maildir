Not a complete revert, but an ifdef-workaround. I wrote this patch last week 
and you were on cc:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=118737949222362&w=2
This patch should fix s390 and let everybody else use your new code. If you 
are conviced that we get a better solution before 2.6.23 hits the street, 
thats fine with me.
