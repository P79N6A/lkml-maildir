The mismatch is caused by two variables called partition_name.  What
does 'nm vmlinux | grep partition_name' show?  Probably one
partition_name at c01aad00 and another at c014cba0.  Both
fs/partitions/msdos.c and drivers/md/md.c define that symbol, md
exports its version.  A good reason why exported symbols should have
unique names.

ksymoops has a hierarchy of trust.  System.map is more trustworthy than
/proc/ksyms because ksyms changes, especially if you rebooted after the
oops and before running ksymoops.
