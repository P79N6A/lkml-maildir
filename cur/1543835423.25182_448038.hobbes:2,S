In cheap boards >3.5GB RAM configurations are usually not officially
supported by the vendor (= not tested) and there are systems where it
doesn't work when enabled in the BIOS (doesn't work = kernel crashes
randomly when accessing bad memory ranges)
I guess it's a subtle hint that above 3GB of RAM you should be using
ECC DIMMs anyways, which need a more expensive workstation class
board.
