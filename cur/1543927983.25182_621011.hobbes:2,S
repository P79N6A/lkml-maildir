"we" = "we kernel developers"

I'm not focussed on Bugzilla.
But a submitter should send a bug report _once_ through one well-defined 
medium, this should result in the bug report not being lost, and every 
other communication of the submitter should be triggered by developers 
requesting additional information.
I don't care whether that's done with Bugzilla, some email based bug 
tracker like the Debian bug tracker, someone putting emails manually 
into some bug tracker like you are doing, or whatever else.
