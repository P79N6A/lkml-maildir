No, we can't have these generic functions blindly save/restore
device specific parts of the config space (offset 64+). I know
of several chipset devices which have read-clear or write-clear
bits where reading/writing would have bad side effects. If at
all the pci core does this, it needs to explicitly walk the
capability list and save/restore the well known capability
registers only.
