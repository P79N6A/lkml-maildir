Subject: bug 2.3.43+ - nfsd assertions on UP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/2/11/129

K6/UP build of 2.3.43 yields the assertions attached in the file below.
P-II SMP does not seem to exhibit this problem.
The assertions do not seem to affect normal system use.
