I think that's an appalling idea.  Someone's trying to configure their
kernel, not research hundreds of new ideas on the internet.  Here's a
better description:
	help
	  The SCSI target code allows your computer to appear as a SCSI
	  device.  This is useful in a SAN or NAS environment where you
	  want other computers to be able to treat this computer as a disc.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called scsi_tgt.
