Hm, maybe Sam can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure that kbuild will 
support more than one Makefile/Kbuild file per module; so if we have some code 
in a subdirectory, I think it all needs to be driven from the parent 
directory's Makefile... and then the above doesn't work.
Sam, is there any way to make this work with some code for the module in a 
subdirectory?
Thanks,
-Eric
