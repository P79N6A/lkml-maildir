Ok, I follow you now -- select(2) depends on certain fs file
operations that no /proc entries currently provide. By adjusting the
file_operations, and providing some needed magic, I could indeed use
select on a /proc entry to get async event notification to user space.
That would be a very elegant solution.
Any hints as to what file_ops are needed to support select?
Clearly read and write are not sufficient.  flush? poll?
