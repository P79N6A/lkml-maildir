System.map only contains the numeric kernel version.  After all, it is
difficult to convert 2.4.19-pre6 to Version_132115-pre6 when symbols
cannot contain '-'.
Don't reinvent the wheel, use ksymoops -s save.map.  ksymoops has all
the verification code that I can think off, -s writes the merged map
including module information.
