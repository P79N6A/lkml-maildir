Anyway, it's not strictly from CodingStyle.  The closest that
CodingStyle has to say about it IMO is this:
"Don't put multiple assignments on a single line either.  Kernel coding style
is super simple.  Avoid tricky expressions."
Also, Andrew Morton and Christoph Hellwig push for splitting up
the if-assignment lines, so it's a trend over the past few
(probably) years.  It's not real new.

so you like the challenge of reading obfuscated code?
At any rate, it's rare that a patch is nacked only due to coding style,
unless it's blatant and occurs many times (like throughout the entire
source file).

Nope.
