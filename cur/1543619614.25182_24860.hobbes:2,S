Wait a minute - it might be readahead that gets killed.
If I remember correctly READA requests are dropped when failing to allocate 
space for it - yes I did...
/usr/src/develop/linux/drivers/block/ll_rw_block.c:746 (earlier kernel)
	/*
	 * Grab a free request from the freelist - if that is empty, check
	 * if we are doing read ahead and abort instead of blocking for
	 * a free slot.
	 */
get_rq:
	if (freereq) {
		req = freereq;
		freereq = NULL;
	} else if ((req = get_request(q, rw)) == NULL) {
		spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
		if (rw_ahead)
			goto end_io;
		freereq = __get_request_wait(q, rw);
		goto again;
	}
Suppose we fail with get_request, the request is a rw_ahead,
it quits... => no read ahead.
Try to add a prink there...
		if (rw_ahead) {
			printk("Skipping readahead...\n");
			goto end_io;
		}
Can it be the problem???
