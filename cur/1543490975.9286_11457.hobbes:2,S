While backing up to the parallel port Zip drive I have, this happened:
Kernel panic: Inactive in scsi_request_queueable
In interrupt handler - not syncing
The two SCSI adapters I have are aic7xxx and ppa.  This only seems to
happen when I'm using ppa.
I've tried to get it to happen again, but without success.  This isn't the
first time it's happened, but it's the first time I've caught the log
messages from it.
Any insight?
Tim.
