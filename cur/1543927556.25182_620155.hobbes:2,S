ok..

I pull
git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/agp-2.6.git#agp-mm
and
git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git#drm-mm
the agp tree was empty when I last pulled it, ~12 hours ago.
<looks>
There's stuff there now:

    agp/intel: Add chipset flushing support for i8xx chipsets.
    This is a bit of a large hammer but it makes sure the chipset is flushed
    by writing out 1k of data to an uncached page. We may be able to get better
    information in the future on how to this better.

    intel-agp: add chipset flushing support
    This adds support for flushing the chipsets on the 915, 945, 965 and G33
    families of Intel chips.
    The BIOS doesn't seem to always allocate the BAR on the 965 chipsets
    so I have to use pci resource code to create a resource
    It adds an export for pcibios_align_resource.

    agp: add chipset flushing support to AGP interface
    This bumps the AGP interface to 0.103.
    Certain Intel chipsets contains a global write buffer, and this can require
    flushing from the drm or X.org to make sure all data has hit RAM before
    initiating a GPU transfer, due to a lack of coherency with the integrated
    graphics device and this buffer.
    This just adds generic support to the AGP interfaces, a follow-on patch
    will add support to the Intel driver to use this interface.
