U missed the point. This is not the case of "If you do not distribute
anything, you do not have to make available the source." because the
vendor is distributing the binaries and source to the customers just fine.
The issue is whether any 3rd party (who is not purchasing the binaries) 
has the right to get the source too as per clause 3b of
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
 . More specifically, is it true that
if u obey clause 3a, u don't have to follow clause 3b ?
