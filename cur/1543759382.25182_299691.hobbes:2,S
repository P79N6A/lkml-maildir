Well, yes, but more importantly, they should also fix a problem with
reboot recovery on the client side.
Currently, if rpc.statd sends an RPC call down to lockd in order to
notify it of a reboot of the server, the sunrpc server code will try to
authenticate that RPC call by doing an upcall to rpc.mountd.... Doh!
