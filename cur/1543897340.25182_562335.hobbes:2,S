Yes, this is tricky stuff.  I have vague ancestral memories that the sort
of inode work which you refer to here can cause various deadlocks, lockdep
warnings and such nasties when if we attempt to call it from the wrong
context (ie: from within fs code).
Possibly we could prevent that by skipping all this code if the caller
didn't have __GFP_FS.
I trust all the code in kick_inodes() was carefuly copied from
prue_icache() and such places - I didn't check it.
