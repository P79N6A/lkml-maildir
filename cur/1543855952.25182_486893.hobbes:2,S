maybe i'm too dense today but i still dont see the fundamental problem. 
Even with complex inter-subsystem interactions, hotplugging could be 
effectively and scalably controlled via a self-recursive per-CPU mutex, 
and a pointer to it embedded in task_struct:
	struct task_struct {
		...
		int hotplug_depth;
		struct mutex *hotplug_lock;
	}
	...
	DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct mutex, hotplug_lock);
	void cpu_hotplug_lock(void)
	{
		int cpu = raw_smp_processor_id();
		/*
		 * Interrupts/softirqs are hotplug-safe:
		 */
		if (in_interrupt())
			return;
		if (current->hotplug_depth++)
			return;
		current->hotplug_lock = &per_cpu(hotplug_lock, cpu);
		mutex_lock(current->hotplug_lock);
	}
	void cpu_hotplug_unlock(void)
	{
		int cpu;
		if (in_interrupt())
			return;
		if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(!current->hotplug_depth))
			return;
		if (--current->hotplug_depth)
			return;
		mutex_unlock(current->hotplug_lock);
		current->hotplug_lock = NULL;
	}
	...
	void do_exit(void)
	{
	...
		DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(current->hotplug_depth);
	...
	}
	...
	copy_process(void)
	{
	...
		p->hotplug_depth = 0;
		p->hotplug_lock = NULL;
	...
	}
50 lines of code at most. The only rule is to not use cpu_hotplug_lock() 
in process-context non-preemptible code [interrupt contexts are 
automatically ignored]. What am i missing?
