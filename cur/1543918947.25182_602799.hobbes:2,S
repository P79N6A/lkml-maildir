I posted the first draft patch set to the OpenFabrics list on September 18:
[ofa-general] [PATCH 0 of 5] XRC implementation patches (libibverbs, libmlx4, core, mlx4)   Jack Morgenstein
[ofa-general] [PATCH 1 of 5] libibverbs: XRC implementation   Jack Morgenstein
[ofa-general] [PATCH 2 of 5] libmlx4: XRC implementation   Jack Morgenstein
[ofa-general] [PATCH 3 of 5] core: XRC implementation for fd = -1 when opening an xrc domain   Jack Morgenstein
[ofa-general] [PATCH 4 of 5] core: XRC implementation -- add support for working with file descriptors   Jack Morgenstein
[ofa-general] [PATCH 5 of 5] mlx4: XRC implementation   Jack Morgenstein
The above patch set implements XRC for userspace verbs layer and below.
The Kernel-space verbs implementation (1 more patch) is finished,
but as yet untested.
