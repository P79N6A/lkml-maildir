That would require converting the full sunrpc server code to use
kthreads, which again means changing nfsd, and lockd too.
I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but it is nontrivial to do. In
particular, kthread's abominable shutdown mechanism simply does not work
or scale when the thread is listening for new requests in svc_recv().
