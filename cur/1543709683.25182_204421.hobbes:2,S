I've booted with kernel profiling turned on.  I've posted some preliminary
results.  I don't have profile data yet, but you can see in the following
that when I turn off my iptables rules, the ping latency graph flattens

interesting when the machine starts thrashing.  If it would be useful for
me to dump anything before then, let me know.
