Hope you mean all flags when you say "have them all at once" because I
hoping to get unsharing of namespace, fs. files and vm in now then
implementing other primitives in an incremental manner. Since the
reorg, these incremental addition of functionality will not require ABI
changes. Namespace and fs unsharing (in addition to shared tree)
is needed for polyinstantiation, critical component for common criteria
lspp evaluation.
As far as unsharing of thread group, IMO implications of signal
unsharing are even messier than signal handler unsharing. I can
investigate it further if folks see usefulness of doing that. However,
I was hoping to get namespace, fs, files and vm unsharing
upstream first.
