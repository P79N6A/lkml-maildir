I just wanted to report my observations as that might help somebody to
debug this problem.
I assumed that you already tried unplugging the ethernet cable and
would only suggest a complete powerdown instead of only rebooting, but
as you wrote later in your mail, you already tried that. :-(

Something is wrojng with your ACPI tables.
That might have several causes:
a) a new check in 2.6.29-rc1 that now detects an error that was always there
b) the cause for the dead eth0 is a corruption in your bios
For me I see this with 2.6.29-rc1:
[    0.000000] FADT: X_PM1a_EVT_BLK.bit_width (16) does not match
PM1_EVT_LEN (4)
2.6.28 does not complain about that.
It would probably be good to compare the boot messages from an older
kernel when eth0 was still working with the boot messages from the
same kernel now that the port is dead.
Any differences might give a better clue than all the errors from 2.6.29...

The taint is because this is the second problem that the kernel
encounterd, the first one from the log you attached to your first post
was:

The W-Taint is there to notify that there already was some (other) problem.

Any other messages about eth0 in the syslog?
It would probably be most helpful, if you could compare any messages
about eth0/ the MCP55 from a known good boot with the current
output...
