You are wrong.
1)
I don't have any agpgart module at all, in any of the kernels that I compiled.
$ find /lib/modules -name 'agpgart.ko'
$ /lib/modules/2.6.22-rc5-master-188e1f81ba31af1b65a2f3611df4c670b092bbac-amd64 -name '*agp*.ko'
/lib/modules/2.6.22-rc5-master-188e1f81ba31af1b65a2f3611df4c670b092bbac-amd64/kernel/drivers/char/agp/sis-agp.ko
/lib/modules/2.6.22-rc5-master-188e1f81ba31af1b65a2f3611df4c670b092bbac-amd64/kernel/drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.ko
/lib/modules/2.6.22-rc5-master-188e1f81ba31af1b65a2f3611df4c670b092bbac-amd64/kernel/drivers/char/agp/via-agp.ko
2)
$ strings /lib/modules/2.6.22-rc5-master-188e1f81ba31af1b65a2f3611df4c670b092bbac-amd64/kernel/drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.ko | grep 'agpgart: Detected an Intel'
<6>agpgart: Detected an Intel %s Chipset.
Hence, in the case that the kernel works, intel-agp is loaded
WITHOUT printing this Detected line - while when it doesn't work,
it is loaded while printing this line.
Perhaps my "solution" is to remove this module completely?
I don't seem to need it.
