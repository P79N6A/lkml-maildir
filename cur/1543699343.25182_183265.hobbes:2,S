Linus,
Didn't your earlier public comments state in clear terms, each kernel
release it self has a unique module interface.  This would be the
effective API for the snap shot in time.  Where as claims of it being a
moving target is between releases?  Thus binary module writers get what
they get?
This looks to be your position in the past.
With this in mind, it makes each "published" source the manual unique into
itself.
I am just a little confused and fuzzy around the edges.
