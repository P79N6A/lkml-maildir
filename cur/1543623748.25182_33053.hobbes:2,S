I don't think that's it. But I have another suspect:
mark_swapfiles in do_magic_resume_2. Oh, and you should also kill it
from do_magic_suspend_*. Its writing on filesystem during resume, and
it does not seem too safe.
However my test machine is hosed so badly I can not repair it with
fsck. [Another day, another bug in fsck ;-)], so it would be great if
you could test this....
