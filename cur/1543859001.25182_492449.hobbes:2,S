it's certainly "simpler and quieter" in one sense, but one need only
look at a submenu like "Network device support" to see a very "loud"
menu, so it's not like this patch would be introducing an
unprecedented level of noise.
also, in the Device Drivers menu, i find it slightly annoying that i
have to *enter* a submenu to read its help information.  if i see the
entry, say, "Dallas's 1-wire bus" and i have no idea what that is and
select "Help", i get the generic help screen.  i need to select that
entry and enter the submenu just to read its top-level help.
in any event, i'm sure folks understand what i'm after here.  if
there's a cleaner and more efficient way to do this, that would work
for me.
