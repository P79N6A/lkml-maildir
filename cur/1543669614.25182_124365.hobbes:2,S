  I still see some problems...
  For one, there are 131 instances of:
      printk("%s\n", blurb);
in various forms in 2.5.66.  Besides possible ritual immolation of
those responsible for such things, something would have to be done
about them.
  Another problem is the one of getting that text onto the console
in readable form. The only thing I can think of is have a two-stage
process where printk puts the data into the log buffer as
zero-terminated strings and then the console write routines format
it for display.  They'd probably need their own buffers to do that.

  Is that "\n" an actual ASCII newline or the printk escape sequence?
