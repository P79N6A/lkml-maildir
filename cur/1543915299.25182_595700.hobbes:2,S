Yes, I have found that I get far less problem in this area leaving the 
MTU at 1500, then putting a larger MTU (usually 9000) into the routing 
table for segments, or even just machines, where I know there is direct 
connectivity. I use 9000 MTU with my directly connected file server, 
1500 elsewhere. I can go to 9000 for nbd servers as well, assuming the 
connection doesn't pass a firewall.
I have some hints that while the switches I use will speak 10/100/1000 
between machines with different speeds, and will handle jumbo packets 
between machines at the same speed, if I'm going Gbit/jumbo to 
1500/slower performance seems to suffer more than talking smaller 
packets. That may be because window size needs to be even larger or 
something.
I have some legacy machines talking 10Mbit/half on 10base2 cable, I may 
be seeing more of this than the average site. That's legacy as in 
"attached to something expensive to replace."
