There are no inodes involved at that point, it's left the fs and is
purely in area between block layer and disk driver. Besides, what would
do with the inode for this problem? If you really want to find eg the
file in question (if you cannot _guess_ when you know the process), then
you could go back from the block number. I've never ever had a need to
go that far, though.
