Mostly checks are done like in sys_rename.  
Some cases require new distributed state in the FS, such as the fact that a
certain directory is a mountpoint, possibly not on the node doing a rename,
but on another node.  
For this the Linux VFS has no api - we added something we call "pinning" for
this in 2.4, but not in 2.6 yet.
