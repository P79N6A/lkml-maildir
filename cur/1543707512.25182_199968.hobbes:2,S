which is a bug, mremap has to retire fully and it's not doing that
(obviously we don't want to write a retirement logic, we only want to
preallocate whatever needed so we don't need to retire), but it's not a
bad bug, since it only matters for real apps, an real apps will only
fall into this do_munamp due the oom condition, which isn't going to
trigger in do_munmap anyways, and even in the unlikely case that it does
it is extremly unlikely to generate an exploitable hole in the real (non
malicious) app.
