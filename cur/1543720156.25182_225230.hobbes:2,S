That is a known issue in older driver versions that should be resolved
now.  It only affects our latest generation of drives that are <=
120GB, it will not affect the larger drives (>= 160GB), and it won't
affect any drives of the next product generation because I fixed the
root cause in the drive as well as helping identify a driver
workaround/fix.
error=0x04 is an "abort" and not a critical error
The original note had error=0x40, which is an Uncorrectable ECC
error... that is bad, and you should probably RMA the drive.
You can also try to see if you can "fix" it by writing to that LBA
(obviously backup your data first) and see if the error goes
away... if that is the case, the ECC could have been due to a write
splice at power failure or some other transient event (extreme shock
or heat or something)
If there are a lot of ECC errors (you have them in about 2 places)
which could be a sign of bad things in progress, just RMA the drive.
