There are other reasons for using a new kernel. One of them is 
interactivity. In the days of 2.4 one could achieve decent interactivity 
for the desktop using preempt and low latency patches. For 2.6 
interactivity was a real issue (possibly because of the new development 
model).

Maximum stability of what ? If the distribution kernels are based on 
vanila kernel (i.e. are based on unstable kernel) how stable will they be 
?
  On lkml someone said that "stable means it won't crash very often".
This sounds like Windows(TM)
