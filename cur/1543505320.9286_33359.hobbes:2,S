   The linker will presumably order object files in link order then .a
   files by reference, so for all drivers in .o archives we can force
   the link order to match the 2.2 probe order
   Does GNU ld behaviour guarantee this. If so a lot of problems go
   away rather nicely.
It probably does, but however if we ever ask it to reorder functions
(GCC has options to place each function emitted into it's own sections
for this very purpose) based upon profiling feedback, this would
break.
Think about Nat Friedman's GROPE hackery...
