Tried applying the 2.0.37 alan cox pre-patches (hoping to be able to use
udma support for the promise Ultra33 controller).
Here's what I found:
2.0.37-pre-1 : ok
2.0.37-pre-2 : spontaneously reboots after "Now booting the kernel"
2.0.37-pre-3 : spontaneously reboots after "Now booting the kernel"
2.0.37-pre-4 : spontaneously reboots after "Now booting the kernel"
2.0.37-pre-5 : spontaneously reboots after "Now booting the kernel"
2.0.37-pre-6 : spontaneously reboots after "Now booting the kernel"
I suspect the problem is the new CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE option. Is there a
known workaround?
