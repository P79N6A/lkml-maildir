Oh, good. Then the patch is correct, I guess ---
it DOES differentiate between 32bit and 64bit architectures.
To resume:
struct flock64 was introduced to the platform-dependent
include/asm/fcntl.h
in the official test7-patch.
test7 provided definitions of struct flock64 for:
alpha
i386
sparc
sparc64
Paulus provided support for the ppc, 
but wasn't included in test7
My patch contains definitions for
ia64
m68k
ppc
sh
s390
Still missing:
mips
mips64
These last structs I can't supply, because I don't dare to resolve
the constant clash between F_GETLK=14 on MIPS and the newly introduced
F_SETLKW64=14. I'll leave that to the MIPS maintainer.
ciao
