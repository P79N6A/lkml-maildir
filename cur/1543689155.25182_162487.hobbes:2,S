I tried 2.6.0-test4-mm2 on other C3 (bought several units including for in my car ;) and that one simply froze after detecting the partiton table of the ide harddisk. adding acpi=off even made then one move again.
When confuses me if that it works with prior kernels and suddenly fails
with later/greater kernels.
Ah well, it's now better known and probably some clever individual will
eventually figure it out and post a patch ! ;-)
