Hello all,
[CC:ed all people who had problems with CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE]
I'm currently debugging these Promise Fasttrak recognition problems.
PDC20270: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
is one of those pesky messages you will see if it doesn't work.
Could you (if you have the hardware) please test 2.4.21-pre7 with
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y
in your .config? If you prefer using the frontends for configuration, 
the option is labeled
"Special FastTrak Feature"
and set it to Y.
If enabling this option causes any problems, please tell me.
Note: this message is about 2.4.21-pre7 (and later) ONLY.
Thank you for testing this.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
