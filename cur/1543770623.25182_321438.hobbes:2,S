Hi Linus,
I have prepared some input patches that I would like to see in 2.6.12.
Most of them are coming from Vojtech's BK tree and were in -mm for quite
some time. They fix a warning in pmouse module, allow OSS drivers to
be compiled when gameport support is disabled, fix joystick button
mapping, broken mapping for right "win" key and more.
Please consider pulling from:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dtor/input.git
branch "for-linus"
