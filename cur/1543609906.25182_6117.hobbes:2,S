There are known problems in AMD760+Radeon setups, and a workaround is
to avoid asserting RADEON_SOFT_RESET_HBP during init.  The latest
kernels have that fix in the radeon drm.  Using that in conjunction
with an X server containing the same fix, I've finally got a stable
761+radeon setup here.
I think the X server fix went in on the 4.1.99 branch, but I know that
at least the Red Hat XFree86-4.1 rpms have got the patch back-ported.

If the CPUs were bottlenecked on memory then they would still be
pegged at 100% according to the OS.  They'd just get less work done in
a given interval.
