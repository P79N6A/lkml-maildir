Subject: 2.6.19-rc1 boot failure--ops in mpu401_init?

A machine that booted fine under 2.6.18-rc6 is failing to boot with
2.6.19-rc1.  After commenting out infinite loop of "Spurious ACK"
messages from atkbd.c that were hiding the original OOPS, I see the an
oops at klist_del+0xd/0x50 with a stack like:
bus_remove_device+0x9f/0xc0
device_del+0x17a/0x1b0
platform_device_del+0x69/0x80
platform_device_unregister+0xd/0x20
alsa_card_mpu401_init+0x7a/0x90
init+0x7f/0x260
kernel_thread_helper+0x7/0x10
Unfortunately I can't actually see the top of the OOPS.  (And haven't
had any luck getting a serial console to work yet...)
I also probably won't have time to try a git-bisect in the next few
days, though I could try it eventually if it'd help.
Let me know of any other details that would be helpful.
--b.
