I'm not sure who to direct this to, but,
Do you suppose that someone could do:
chmod -R ugo+r Documentation/* 
on the documentation tree?  There are a couple files that occasionally
annoy me by being unreadable by non-root.  Namely:
 -rw-------   1 1046     101         15872 May 10 16:00 kernel-docs.txt
 -rw-------   1 1046     101         53064 Feb  6 15:46 proc.txt
I know one doesn't normally RTFM, but when you do, you certainly do not
want to be hindered.
Dave
