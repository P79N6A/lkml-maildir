    The current semantics are scalable. Anything which resets the file
    pointer upon change of a file/directory/whatever isn't...
Anyone using a 1GB directory deserves for it not to scale.  I think
this is a very poor example.
No that I disagree with you, the largest directories I have on my
system here are 2.6MB (freedb, lots of hashed flat-files in one
directory), here I do agree that you should not have to reset the
counter everytime.
