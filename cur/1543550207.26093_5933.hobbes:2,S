Has anyone tried Redhat 7.0 yet? What a mess.
1) It would not compile stock kernels out of the box. (ends at
compress.S) with a fatal error.
2) Trying to compile the kernel source for 2.2.16 that comes with the
redhat disk (which is very different than the stock 2.2.16) causes my
system come to a screeching halt, no messages, no errors, crashed solid.
I have a Supermicro PIIIDME motherboard with a GeForce2 graphics card,
adaptec 2940UW scsi and seagate UW 9 gig scsi drive.
