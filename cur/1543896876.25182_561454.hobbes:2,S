It is somewhat correct, except that nothing prevents them from trying to
be even smarter. For instance, your video player consumes some CPU, but
also calls X which itself consumes some CPU. There are tricks to track
what process makes X work so that both share the same slices, generally
resulting in improved smoothness without playing with applications priorities
yet.
It might be worth trying anyway.
