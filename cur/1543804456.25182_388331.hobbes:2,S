And Debian Sarge is still at 5.2.1. 
(Not to obsolete iproute and ipsec-tools versions)
Ok, Debian Sarge is scheduled for removal from my
system.
What:   Debian Sarge
When:   2006-02-04
Files:  ssh root@bertha -c "find /bin /sbin /usr /lib"
Why:    Its maintained to slow for a number of years
        and can be replaced by Kubuntu or Ubuntu.
	Having a recent kernel (with more bugs fixed)
	and trying to use it, becomes harder and harder.
Who:    $FROM
