To quote parts of that:
Anyway, here's what the GCC manual has to say about use of
__attribute__((section)) on variables:
`section ("SECTION-NAME")'
     Use the `section' attribute with an _initialized_ definition of a
     _global_ variable, as shown in the example.  GCC issues a warning
     and otherwise ignores the `section' attribute in uninitialized
     variable declarations.
     You may only use the `section' attribute with a fully initialized
     global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker
     requires each object be defined once, with the exception that
     uninitialized variables tentatively go in the `common' (or `bss')
     section and can be multiply "defined".  You can force a variable
     to be initialized with the `-fno-common' flag or the `nocommon'
     attribute.
And the top-level Makefile has:
CFLAGS          := -Wall -Wundef -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs \
                   -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
Note the -fno-common.
And indeed all the __initdata annotated local and global variables on
s390 are in the init.data section. So I'm wondering what this patch
series is about. Or I must have missed something.
