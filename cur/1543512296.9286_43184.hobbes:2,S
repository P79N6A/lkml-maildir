Correct. And major/minor numbers are not needed there.

Correct.

Not at all. Take a look on how devfs doing it: when special file under /dev
is created then it's connected with address of driver (roughly: automatically
created major/minor numbers and lookup there is just to make system compatible
with what was done before). When you access driver you just access driver.
Without additional lookups in major/minor numbers table ! Gosh. Why MORE
EFFECTIVE and MORE SCALEABLE thing is called "days before even CP/M" is
beyond me.

Gooch also understood it very well. But when you try to open device you WILL
use string (like "/dev/printer/0") and not number anyway. So transition phase
is needed anyway. Why we must translate it to major/minor numbers first and
not straight to driver address ? It is beyond me.

Not at all. This is idea is not scaleable and not effective. Read devfs FAQ
and you'll find -- why.
RJ> However, soon it will have to be extended because we need more numbers.
And it'll make it even less effective (though more scaleable :-)
