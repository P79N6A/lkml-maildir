Annotations don't have to be per-entry. It can be something as simple as 
"this particular file is exposed to user space", or "things from here to 
here are exposed to user space".
And while automation is good, sometimes automation isn't even worth it. I 
suspect it might be good just to _comment_ the structures we expose to 
user space, even if it's never used for anything but as a note to tell 
people not to change it.
