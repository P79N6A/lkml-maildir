I dunno, but I am currently writing a Rubik's cube application in
GTK from scratch.  Initially it is for 3x3 cube only, but I'm
considering the Rubik's revenge as well.  I am unaware of any
later cubes with larger dimensions, however if there are any, I'd
love pointers as to where to acquire them.
Anyone interested in this, should contact me via email
privately...
