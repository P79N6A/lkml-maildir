lspci -v show me that VGA cards are in IRQs 9 and 12.
The MSS (compatible, the aedsp16) use the IRQ 10 so there should not be
IRQ conflicts.

Definitely no.

No. I use a resolution of 1280x1024 (19" monitor) and I have just switched
VT2 to 800x600 and back and it worked fine (of course with some
misalignment with monitor but that's expected.

Okay. You can find attached all the info you asked for.
Thanks.
