100M hurts on a 4G box? No-way ;)
it hurts when such 100M of normal zone are mlocked
by an highmem-capable users and you can't allocate one more inode but
you have still 3G free of highmem (google is doing this, they even drop
a check so they can mlock > half of the ram).
Or it hurts when you can't allocate an inode because such 100M are in
pagetables on a 64G box and you still have 60G free of highmem.

even simpler, swapoff -a and malloc and have fun! ;) (again ask google,
they run w/o swap for obvious good reasons)
Or if you have enough time, wait those 100M to be filled by pagetables
on a 64G box.
