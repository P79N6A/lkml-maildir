No problem at all here. I'm with new and very new names for a long time :))
The main problem is consistency, I'd be very upset to survive the third
change... _ALL_ compatibility entries are evil by definition so our
distribution has to be useable without any of them.

I second your congrats :)) I do remember that mortal combat for devfsd
inclusion which I had been a part of...
But I can't agree that it's just ALSA left... I'd name such musthave's like
journalling fs (presumably reiserfs as most mature by now) and LVM. May be
most of the mere users does not realize how important those things are, but
I do see our good old RS/6000 with 1,000+ days uptime every day. And I do
remember that we did already change three failed disks with root filesystem
during these almost three years...
