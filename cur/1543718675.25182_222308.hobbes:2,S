I tried manually enabling DMA for hdg (Mitsumi 7802TE on HPT370A.) I get:
hdg: DMA timeout retry
hdg: 0 bytes in FIFO
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdg: status error: error=0x00
hdg: drive not ready for command
hdg: status timeout: status=0xd8 { Busy }
hdg: status timeout: error=0xd8MediaChangeRequested LastFailedSense 0x0d 
hdg: drive not ready for command
hdg: ATAPI reset complete
hdg: 0 bytes in FIFO
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: 0 bytes in FIFO
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: 0 bytes in FIFO
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: 0 bytes in FIFO
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: DMA disabled
while trying to rip audio cd, and the rip does not progress at all. Doesn't
lock up, though. The cd writer (Mitsumi 4804TE) did function as hdg with DMA
enabled (and it got enabled by default.)
So my original question stays: is there any change a firmware upgrade could
help? (I'm kind of wary of trying random firmwares, since Mitsumi doesn't
seem to provide one, and the most linked firmware site
(
http://www.herrie.org/
) says it was just defaced in the front page...
Besides all those firmwares are either "hacked" or "modified".)
What else might be the problem?
