Actually I'm already one bit short for WIP patches.... :)
I can compensate for it by using the same bit for IDE_HFLAG_CS5520
and IDE_HFLAG_VDMA for now (they are set only by cs5520 host driver)
but long-term we should get rid of some flags (IDE_HFLAG_ABUSE*,
especially IDE_HFLAG_ABUSE_DMA_MODES, sound like a good candidates
for extermination) or make flags field u64 (eeew)...
