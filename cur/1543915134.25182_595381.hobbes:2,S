It seems to me containerization is much more similar a feature to SYSV
IPC, process accounting / auditing, and should be an option under
General setup, possibly with its own submenu.  Nearly all the features
under general setup provide optional extensions to kernel services
available from userspace, and so it seems containerization falls
naturally into that category.
Virtualization is completely different, and probably needs separate
server (kvm, lguest) and client (kvm, lguest, xen, vmware) sections in
it's menu.
