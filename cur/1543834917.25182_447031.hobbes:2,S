    Well, That change from macro to inline function is more bettter idea.
    Regarding the Documentation/newwhere, I also have such plan to
complete it, but need some time.
We will have it.
    Regarding list_* marco, I really apologize, they wrote when I
implemented matched_lock/simple_lock
as spin lock. As I found this design have some restrictions, I replace
spin lock with semaphore, but leave these macro in header. I will clear
them.
    For Patch splitting, I can not find more words in Documentation/,
however, It seem Arnd are right.
The next version of this patch will join core patch and header patch.
    Last, I had tried again and again, but mail client still replace TAB
with spaces, I think I should replace it with another.
    Thanks a lot.
