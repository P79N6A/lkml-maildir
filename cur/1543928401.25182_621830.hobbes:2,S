Not really.  The freezer puts tasks into a particular well-understood
state: they're either in usermode, or in the kernel in the
refrigerator.  And since the places which call into the refrigerator are
explicit in the source, and not terribly numerous, its easy to audit
exactly what the state is at each call.

Well, those are somewhat different.  The existing suspend/resume driver
callbacks are sufficient for a device to be in that state.  What I want
for Xen is more global: I just want to make sure tasks are not preempted
in the middle of a state which can't be suspended.  The specific details
of the state I want are moderately complex, but short lived.  The
problem with other mechanisms - like stop_machine - is that they can
leave threads preempted in one of the states I can't handle, whereas the
the freezer is more deterministic.

No, that doesn't really work.  Aside from scattering hooks everywhere
there's pagetable updates, there's no real existing place to hook into. 
While I could put those hooks in, they would amount to changing the
kernel-internal pagetable update interface for everyone to deal with a
corner case of a fairly obscure user - I don't think its a good tradeoff.
The freezer is nice because the state it puts each task into is
well-defined, and is well-suited for Xen's use.  In fact, I would agree
with you that the use I want to put the freezer to better suits it than
its current use in suspend/resume.
