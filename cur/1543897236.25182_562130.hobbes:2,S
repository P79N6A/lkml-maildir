The cs46xx OSS driver in the kernel is not our work. This discussion is 
about _our_ OSS 4.0 so the above is not a valid argument.

The driver for cs46xx/cs4280 devices in OSS 4.0 is called cs4280.c. It's 
based on the same sample sources from Crystal than the kernel cs46xx 
one. It doesn't support the rear channels any better which could be an 
argument. However OSS is now an open source community project so anybody 
has freedom to fix this problem.
