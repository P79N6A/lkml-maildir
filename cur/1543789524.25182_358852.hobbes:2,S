Subject: [PATCH] build break in include/asm-x86_64/atomic.h

While building the latest -mm kernel on x86-64, I hit a build break (see
below).

The problem is the atomic_scrub function is attempting to use 'u32', 
which is not defined at this point.  If the 'u32's are defined (by 
including <asm/types.h>) or changed to 'unsigned int', there is no 
problem (and the kernel compiles, boots, and runs perfectly).
Below is a patch which changes the 'u32' to 'unsigned int'.
