1. Make the name explicit: inode->i_union->bdev.
2. Change all the code that refers to the newly unioned fields.
   It should be clear from the name i_union that no code should
   read a field until it knows the type of the inode.
3. Do something similar for struct page.  At least that would
   remove the ugly overloading of page->next_hash fields on the Sparc.
