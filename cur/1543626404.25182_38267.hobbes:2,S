The "bug" is really the lack of a feature present on 486+ cpus.  A 386
will allow the kernel to write to a write-protected user page (but not a
write-protected kernel page).  In user mode, write protect works as it
should.  The kernel works around this by doing extra checks when writing
to user pages (check the *_user() functions).  It is not a security
hole, because if the kernel wasn't compiled with the workaround, it
refuses to boot on those cpus.
