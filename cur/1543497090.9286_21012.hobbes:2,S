Hi!
I have a prob with the kernel-nfs. I'm using Redhat 6.0 (well, almost),
Kernel 2.2.9 (with nfsd-2.2.8-1.patch from knfsd-1.3.2). knfsd-1.3.2 
is installed.
my /etc/exports:
	/ 10.72.2.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)  
now, if I mount it:
	mount -t nfs dollerup:/ /mnt/xx/
syslog says:
	May 30 08:10:34 dollerup mountd[414]: authenticated mount request from lola.kapet.vpn:784 
and I can correctly access / and everything that is on the same volume.
but if I try to get into the homes (mounted separately) it does not work,
instead syslog tells me:
	May 30 08:10:40 dollerup kernel: fh_verify: //home permission failure, acc=4, error=1
hm. well. WTF???
the curious thing is, if I mount it directly:
	mount -t nfs dollerup:/home/ /mnt/xx/
I can access all homes without any problems.
so it seems to me, there is a bug in knfsd, which makes it impossible for
me to go across mountpoints, or am I totally dumb today?
