Unless kernel 2.4.1[567] used (they return the size in sectors) or no
ioctl conflict with the unofficial but used BLKSETLASTSECT (the issue was
also summarized at 
http://lwn.net/2001/0906/kernel.php3
). The last one
could (did?) corrupt NTFS (NTFS keeps metadata there) when one tried to
get the device size by BLKGETSIZE64 ...
Unfortunately not many softwares get BLKGETSIZE64 right, but at least the
latest fdisk (2.12a) and e2fsprogs (1.36-WIP) are ok AFAIS, although they
workaround these issues differently.

I checked these for 2.4.25 and 2.6.5. In 2.4 the last odd sector is
visible only by BLKGETSIZE64 and BLKGETSIZE, otherwise it can't be
accessed, as we agreed later on.
But 2.6 is ok in all cases, size is seen correctly by BLKGETSIZE64,
BLKGETSIZE and accessible by lseek.
I don't know how intrusive, risky would be the backport but I suspect 
it's not worth. 
Thank you for clarifying the issue,
