Not entirely true.
Even with the traditional -fomit-frame-pointer build, "sched.c" has always
been built with -fno-fomit-frame-pointer in order to get the correct
"wchan" of callers of schedule() and wait_on().
See kernel/Makefile for details.
So yes, old kernels (and CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=n) have traditionally
avoided the bug _mostly_. But it could still bite us in some rather
important functions.
