Atul, Sreenivas:
Your management apps currently issue a private ioctl MEGAIOC_QNADAP
which returns the number of megaraid_mm-handled adapters in the
system.  How do you map a megaraid adapter number to a struct
Scsi_Host device, to be sure you're acting on the controller you think
you are?
SCSI LLDDs don't show up in sysfs under /sys/bus/scsi/drivers at
present, which is where, I think, you would want to put megaraid_mm
with links to show the scsi_host and pci_dev associated with this
adapter.  Something like this:
/sys
|-- bus
|   `-- drivers
|       `-- scsi
|           `-- megaraid_mm
|               `-- adapter0
|                   |-- pci_dev -> ../../../../../devices/pci0000:03/0000:03:06.0
|                   `-- scsi_host -> ../../../../../class/scsi/scsi_host/host0
|-- class
|   `-- scsi
|       `-- scsi_host
|           `-- host0
`-- devices
    `-- pci0000:03
        `-- 0000:03:06.0
Thoughts?
Matt
