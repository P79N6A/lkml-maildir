Subject: [PATCH 2/6] uml: add mode=skas0 as a synonym of skas0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/9/69

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Too many people were confused by skas0 and tried using "mode=skas0". And after
all, they are right - accept this.
