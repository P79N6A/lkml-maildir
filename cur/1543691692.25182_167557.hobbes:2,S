Well, the code path is easy enough to find.  If you look at suspend() in
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c, you'll see calls to pm_send_all() and
device_suspend().  They both end up filtering down to the USB HC drivers.  
The bad one is pm_send_all(); it comes too soon.
By the way, David, apparently core/hcd-pci.c wants the HC drivers to set 
the hcd state to USB_STATE_SUSPENDED, but a simple grep shows that neither 
the EHCI nor the OHCI driver does so.  That certainly looks like an 
oversight, though I'm not sure in which source file.
Meanwhile, here's a simple patch to improve logging during suspend and
resume.  Greg, if David approves please apply it.
