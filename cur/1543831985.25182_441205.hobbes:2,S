Sigh.  So if we get this wrong (and we have, and we shall) then the error
gets silently accepted by the toolchain until someone comes along and tries
to link it on FVR.
Is there anything we can do about that?  Mangling the names with some macro
isn't attractive.  Teach sparse about it?  Dunno.
Right now we're showing a grand total of two identifiers tagged with
__initdata in all of include/.  Why isn't FRV blowing up all over the
place?  Is there something about nr_kernel_pages which made us get unlucky?
