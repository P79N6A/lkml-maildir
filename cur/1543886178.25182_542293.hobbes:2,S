One quick observation.
Isn't it important for both processes to have the same "loops_per_ms" value?
At least on my machine, it's not always the case. See how results
differ in the following 2 tests:
(1) when loops_per_ms happen to be quite different;
(2) ----//---- pretty same values.
Both are for mainline 2.6.19 and both processes have equal characteristics.
namely,
./cpuhog 600 400 10
I run them one by one from different shells.
(1)
dimm@dimm:/mnt/storage/kernel/sched-bench> ./cpuhog 600 400 10
loops_per_ms = 94517.958412  <---------- (*)
run time = 600 ms (56710775 loops), sleep time = 400 ms, epoch time = 10 s
Obtained 6.39 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 4.52 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
Obtained 4.47 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 4.47 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 4.53 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 4.14 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
...
dimm@dimm:/mnt/storage/kernel/sched-bench> ./cpuhog 600 400 10
loops_per_ms = 51599.587203  <------------- (**)
run time = 600 ms (30959752 loops), sleep time = 400 ms, epoch time = 10 s
Obtained 3.91 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.16 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.18 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.19 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 2.97 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Look at a difference between (*) and (**) and we can see the reported
results are different.
Although, one would expect both are treated "equally" with the current
scheduler (whatever one puts in this meaning :)
(2) now another attempt.
dimm@dimm:/mnt/storage/kernel/sched-bench> ./cpuhog 600 400 10
loops_per_ms = 96711.798839
run time = 600 ms (58027079 loops), sleep time = 400 ms, epoch time = 10 s
Obtained 4.32 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.84 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.86 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.84 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.86 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
...
dimm@dimm:/mnt/storage/kernel/sched-bench> ./cpuhog 600 400 10
loops_per_ms = 96899.224806
run time = 600 ms (58139534 loops), sleep time = 400 ms, epoch time = 10 s
Obtained 4.28 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.88 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.88 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.40 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.42 seconds of execution time in 10 elapsed seconds
Obtained 3.89 seconds of execution time in 11 elapsed seconds
...
In this case, "loops_per_ms" happened to be pretty equal so the
reported results look pretty similar. "top" showed very close numbers
in this case as well.
Maybe it's different in your case (besides I don't claim that
everything is ok with SD and CFS) but I guess this could be one of the
reasons.
At least, fork()-ing the second process (with different
run_time/sleep_time characteristics) from the first one would ensure
both have the same "loop_per_ms".
