Bear in mind that my _original_ reason for implementing some of this
was to tell what's going on with the kernel on my machines.  I'm fairly
opposed to shifting it to userspace just because someone wants a bloated
sysfs interface to drive some tiddly little LEDs and then having to
losing the benefits of the existing implementation.

See Netwinders.  They have a bi-colour LED which has independent red
and green LEDs in the same package.  When they're both on it's yellow.
It's _VERY_ useful to see the green LED flashing and know that the
headless machine is running, or that the red LED being on means that
either it hasn't booted a kernel yet or the system has successfully
shut down.
It means I don't have to fsck around with monitor cables before pulling
the power.
And no, doing that from userspace won't work because userspace is dead
_before_ the system has finished shutting down (see drive cache
flushing on shutdown.)
It's also _VERY_ useful to know whether the kernel has managed to get
far enough through the boot that the heartbeat LED is flashing but
maybe not sufficiently to bring up the serial console as well -
again another thing that a userspace implementation will never be
able to support.
So sorry... I'm definitely opposed.
