That will be fixed with inotify.

I doesn't have to be fam. I am not sure if having a daemon is the best
way to go either, but I think that having a daemon (not necessarily fam)
could be beneficial. Beyond multiplexing you could keep a buffer of
events and try and combine some events before sending them to the apps.
But if it turns out that a daemon is not the best way, we can adjust the
limits set on the driver and everyone can just use it directly. So relax
I am not trying to force anything, it was just an idea.
