well ... file2alias assumes scalar fields with "is equal" or "do not care" 
values. Input handler matching requires bit (sub-)fields matching (with 
longest filed being 512 bits). I od not see how it can be implemented using 
standard alias syntax. This syntax fails even for some PCI entries already 
(while using pcimap allows for more elaborate matching)
Can you name some current users of module.alias?
thank you
