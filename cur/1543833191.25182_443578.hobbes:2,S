Well, overcurrent is a potentially dangerous situation.  That's why it 
gets reported with dev_err priority.
Evidently it's a hardware fault.  Perhaps the overcurrent-detect input 
lines are floating and constantly triggering as a result.  It's not even 
clear that attaching a USB device would make the problem go away.
Since you're not using the UHCI controller on that computer, you could 
simply rmmod uhci-hcd (or modify /etc/modprobe.conf to prevent it from 
being loaded in the first place).  That would stop the constant interrupts 
and the syslog spamming.
But as for fixing the underlying hardware problem, I don't think there's 
anything we can do.
