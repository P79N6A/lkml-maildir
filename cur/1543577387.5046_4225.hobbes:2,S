I get th eopposite behavior.  If both are compiled in only ACPI works.
(Only tested w/ 2.4.0-test kernels, though.)
Either way you need the userspace daemon running to actually do
anything.  Even my notebook's key for toggling full-screen vs
un-expanded display on the lcd does nothing unless apmd or acpid
as applicable are running....
