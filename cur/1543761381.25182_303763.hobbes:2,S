Any update on this?  The problem is still apparent in 2.6.11.  It seems
to be a regression from 2.6.10.  And now I've heard 2.6.12-rc1 mentioned
with no motion on this.
Here's the trace again in case you missed it:
http://www.alsa-project.org/~rlrevell/2912us
The "latency regressions" thread was all sub-millisecond stuff which can
be ignored IMHO.  Still interesting because they are regressions after
all, but not a real world problem.
However this one can be several milliseconds.  It's a real problem.
I'd hate to have to ship 2.6.12 with a disclaimer that ext3 with
"data=ordered" is not suitable for the desktop (as it clearly violates
the stated desktop responsiveness goal of 1ms).
