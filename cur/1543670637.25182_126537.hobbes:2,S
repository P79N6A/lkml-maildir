The patch you supplied (check disk->minors != 1 before calling 
devfs_remove_partitions) did not apply do 2.5.68; the code in 
fs/partitions/check.c has changed since your base version. However, 
hand-editing to do the same check has solved the problem.
I'll Christoph supply a patch, since he's the one that's been working in 
that whole devfs area.
