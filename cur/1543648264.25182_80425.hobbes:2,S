Hi
Is there anything I can do to flush all usb / usb storage buffers to my
compact flash ? 
At the moment I have to rmmod usb-storage && rmmod usb-uhci && modprobe
usb-uhci && modprobe usb-storage to ensure all data is written
correctly, otherwise the directory structure isn't saved even after an
unmount.
Is there an application, function call, ioctl, .... which I can use,
instead of the above mentioned inconvenient way ?
Kind regards
Joseph Wenninger
