An even stranger line:
fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_buf.c has:
    aentry = kmalloc(sizeof(a_list_t), GFP_ATOMIC & ~__GFP_HIGH);
Given the gfp.h line:
    #define GFP_ATOMIC  (__GFP_VALID | __GFP_HIGH)
that xfs_buf line makes no sense.  There is almost no chance
that the author of that xfs_buf.c line was aware they were
spelling the empty gfp flag __GFP_VALID.
