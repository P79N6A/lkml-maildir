I have Alpha system based on AMD 751 & ALI 1543C chipset (Nautilus).
Since I compiled and boot kernel 2.4.0 problem appears.
1. don't work IDE DMA mode at all, only PIO
2. don't work eepro100 support for Intel Ethernet card - driver
reports I use non-busmaster slot (2.2.16 works fine)
3. many other issues such SCSI device hang up during insmod driver and
so on.
It seems there is problem with DMA, but 2.2.16 works fine. Any help?
