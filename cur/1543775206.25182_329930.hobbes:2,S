(Fixed Andrea's email address)
This is definitely broken in 2.6.12.  I wrote a test module that does
__get_free_pages(GFP_DMA,0) until it sees that the page it gets is
executable (it got about 30 pages before it got one that's executable),
and then it does a change_page_attr(page,PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE) on the
page.  Shortly thereafter the system reboots--presumably it got a triple
fault because the exception handler was no longer executable, or
something like that.
My personal opinion of the best way to fix this would be option 3
above--just rewrite change_page_attr() so that the 511 other little
pages that are created inheret the _PAGE_NX bit from the large page that
was split--but make sure that it doesn't revert these PTEs back into a
large page if change_page_attr(page,PAGE_KERNEL) is called, since the
other pages in this 2MB area aren't PAGE_KERNEL.
Option 1 seems more correct to me, but not necessarily worth the
performance cost.
What do you think?
