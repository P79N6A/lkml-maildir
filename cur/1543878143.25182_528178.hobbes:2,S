urgh.  It would be better to continue to rework slab/slub callers in the
fashion which you have been doing, don't you think?
Rephrasing my earlier point: are we doing things in the correct order here,
and efficiently?  It is not settled in my mind whether we want to merge
slub _at all_.  Do we have enough information yet to be able to make that
decision?
And if that information indicates that a slub merge _is_ justified, why is
the chosen approach superior to the incremental one: if slab code is grotty
(it is), clean it up.  If slab has unnecessary stuff, delete it.
