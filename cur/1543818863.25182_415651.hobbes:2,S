Subject: [i386, x86-64] ioapic_register_intr() and assign_irq_vector() questions

Since ioapic_register_intr() ties, for the PCI case, the interrupt gate for vector to interrupt[vector], doesn't this,
since do_IRQ() derives the IRQ from the value loaded in the handler at that address (which is the value of vector), mean
that here irq == vector in all cases? If so, why does this function need an if/else (the 'else' case would then be good
for both cases)?
Looking at the call paths assign_irq_vector() can get called from, I would think this function, namely as it's using
static variables, lacks synchronization - is there any (hidden) reason this is not needed here?
Thanks, Jan
