Sorry, I'll drop this.  The level of code churn in linux-next (during
the merge window!) means that I've basically lost confidence that my
lameass fixed-up code will still even work.
What makes things worse here is that people tromp on other people's
code, or make changes without looking in linux-next to see what changes
other people have made.  This causes Stephen to give up and drop the
offending tree, so others who had code based on that offending tree end
up having a mess to deal with as well.  Then, 24 or 48 hours later that
tree comes back again so the mess comes back again.
Please find out from Rusty (I think it's that tree?) when he's finished
futzing with everything (module.c, percpu code, etc) and then respin
these patches?

It might be better to add that to linux-next.  If we want to merge
kmemleak.
