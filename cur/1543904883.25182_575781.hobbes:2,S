cifs and nfs (probably others) have some mount options which are mount
order dependent ie may be invalid or ignored when you have more than
one mount to the same server, or mount the same resource in two places
with different options.  In the long run, at least for cifs, we may be
able to better handle a user mounting to the same server twice with
e.g. different security options (authentication, packet signing ...),
but in the meantime are there any thoughts on whether those type of
mount options should be displayed differently
