Ok, I reproduced your exact .config and built a kernel with egcs-1.1.2.
It booted fine as far as it could go on my hardware, so I think we can
exclude compiler problem.  According to Changes, you _should_ be safe
on binutils too, however..

If you can, upgrade to the latest 2.9.5 binutils release.  Older
releases such as 2.8, 2.8.xx, and the FSF's 2.9.1 should be avoided if
at all possible.  The later releases of 2.9.1.0.x (anything where x >= 22)
can and do compile the kernel properly, but there are many benefits
to upgrading to 2.9.5 if you're up to it.
