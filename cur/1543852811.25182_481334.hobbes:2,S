The corrected code in <
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7476#c4>
covers the full cache range.  Granted that modern CPUs may be able to track
multiple simultaneous cache access streams: how many such streams are they
likely to be able to follow at once?  It seems like going from 1 to 2 would
be a big win, 2 to 3 a small win, beyond that it wouldn't likely make much
incremental difference.  So what do the actual implementations in the field
support?
The code (original and corrected) uses 6 simultaneous streams.
I have a modified version that takes a `ways' parameter to use an arbitrary
number of streams.  I'll post that onto bugzilla.kernel.org.
