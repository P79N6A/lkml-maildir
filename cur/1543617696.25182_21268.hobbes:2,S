How old is your 815 chipset ? I had problems with high load crashes on
three 815 based boards all of which were the same (MX3S) and all of which
went back.
Intel has errata on the 815 where the SDRAM voltage drive is apparently
wrong and board level corrections to cope. I've never been able to find
out if the board had these.

How old is your kernel - and do you have both the 440BX and i81x AGP 
included. The AGP on the i815 basically has two totally different worlds
1.	The rather nice onboard 2D/3D (i810 alike)
2.	When you plug in a video card (440 alike)
