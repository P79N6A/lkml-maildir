Yup, I know this *now* :-)
My point is that I had no idea the drive was doing write-caching.
hdparm only offers an option to set it to on/off, not to query it.
Just disabling it in a boot up script *might* be enough to make this
safe again, but I've not looked at the hdparm & IDE code, so this
is just a theory.
regards,
Dave.
