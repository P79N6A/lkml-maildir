    Hi!
    [ I suspect dri-devel is going to bounce my mails, so I'm CC'ing
linux-kernel ]
    DRI stopped working on my setup in Linux 2.6.9-rc1-bk12.  I've
narrowed the problem down to this changeset (Drop __HAVE_CTX_BITMAP,
__HAVE_SG, __HAVE_PCI_DMA):
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@413a5e3ecfrYcOqFo6JOgkPIU-qVmQ
    Backing this patch out makes DRI in -bk12 work again.
    I've verified this on two machines with PCI Radeon 7000 cards, so
there's PCIGART stuff involved; unfortunately I don't have any AGP
Radeons to test with.  (I originally suspected the __REALLY_HAVE_AGP
change, but that's fine, along with the DRIVER_FILE_FIELDS removal).
    For what it matters, I'm primarily testing on a ppc Macintosh, but
I've verified this on a PC too.
    Wow, there was no kidding about DRM being difficult to read.  :-)
I hope this is helpful, but I don't urgently need DRI working.  I'd be
glad to give any help tracking the problem down.
    On kernels with non-working DRM, I get this message from the kernel:
[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
[drm:radeon_unlock] *ERROR* Process 2150 using kernel context 0
    While X says:
