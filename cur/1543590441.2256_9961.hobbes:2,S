I've seen that, but no.  I want a queue of pointers, and the queue
can/should be of fixed length.  (I don't want to deal with
allocating/deallocating nodes for this... I just need something simple.)
For now, I'll just write my own, but I may try submitting it as a
"kernel library" type thing later on.
Thanks,
