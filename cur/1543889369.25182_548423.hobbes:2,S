That "fix" shouldn't be needed at all, the MMCONFIG memory range 
shouldn't be covered by PCI ordering rules, so there should be no such 
thing as write posting. I suspect that the author of such patch(es) was 
doing so out of some misguided sense that it was needed. (And if there 
is some chipset where it is actually needed, better just disable 
MMCONFIG on that one, as there's no way to use it sanely.)
