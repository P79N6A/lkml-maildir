I agree that it is useful to expose the partitions of devices via the 
filesystem, but struct device seems way too heavy-handed to describe them. 
I think they would be better off as a single attribute file that dumped 
the partition data about the disk. 
You would have something like:
/sys/class/disk/
|-- devices
|   |   `-- 0 -> ../../../root/wherever
and in 'wherever': 
/sys/root/wherever/
|-- partitions
I dunno about the format; or if we would want one file or one per 
partition.

Sorry, I take it back. It wasn't an oops; it was a backtrace due to the
partitions being removed during an illegal context.
