My question because We ran a 32 Bit application in Sun AMD64 Optreon
with 1GB connection (Kernel 2.4 x86_64 with 8 Gb memory & 2 CPUs)  and
we had trouble time with it because the user tried to put the
application processing data in a nas box (in the network) and that
made the machine to use more than 60% of the NAS CPU and no one else
was able to access the NAS
right now we are trying to see if the problem because the AMD64 Bit is
very powerful or  is it because it has 1GB connection and the
application designed to be a bad :)
