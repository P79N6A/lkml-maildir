Ignore my earlier mail about the DMA timeouts and NMI errors after applying 
the ACPI timer override patch.  My bad.  I forgot to recompile the modules 
after I applied your patch - and I believe thats what caused those errors. 
I recompiled and reinstalled the modules this time and no errors [well, apart 
from those lost ticks, which anyway is a separate issue]  with the ACPI Timer 
override for NVIDIA chipset. 
Alan - Needless to say you should keep Andi's NVIDIA ACPI Timer override patch 
in -ac. It works.
Sorry for the confusion!
