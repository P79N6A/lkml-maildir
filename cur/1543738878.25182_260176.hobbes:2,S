I seem to remember Ingo saying that this *is* still somewhat "proof of concept",
and that the gcc preprocessor ad-crockery was just a *really* nice way of doing
it semi-automagically while minimizing the patch footprint and intrusiveness.
I'm sure that once we've got a non-moving target, at least 2 or 3 levels
of preprocessor redirection will get cleaned up and removed, to save
future programmer's sanity..
(Viewed alternatively - how many more flubs would the T4-T7 series have
if Ingo wasn't using the preprocessor to do the heavy lifting?  For something
at the current level of cookedness, it's doing fairly well)...
