can you point this out in a bit more detail, eg where exactly is this
happening? I think it is in this bit
       /* As we bypass the pagecache we must now flush the inode so that
         * we see all the changes from userspace... */
        write_inode_now(inode, 1);
        /* And now flush the block cache so that kernel sees the changes
*/
        invalidate_bdev(sb->s_bdev, 0);
        mutex_lock(&inode->i_mutex);
        mutex_lock(&dqopt->dqonoff_mutex);
        if (sb_has_quota_enabled(sb, type)) {
                error = -EBUSY;
                goto out_lock;
but that doesn't quite match your description...
