Your datagram receiver isn't keeping up with your datagram
transmitter. If you increase the number of datagrams that are
being queued, you will still encounter the same problem, but
after more datagrams are stored. You need to either throttle
the transmitter or speed up the receiver.
In your test code, you deliberately don't receive anything
for 5 seconds. What do you expect? You are lucky you get
one datagram!
