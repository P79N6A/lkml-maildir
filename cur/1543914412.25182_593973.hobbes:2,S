Not possible? We're doing it all the time...
However, your ideas were rejected in this discussion,
and you can't seem to get over it.

IMHO there is a lack of openness caused by people being burned
in past flamewars. This makes it a bit difficult to see through
what happens and why, and to participate.  However, I think it
is completely wrong to say that the community is "kicking off people".

Oh dear, there we go again... more flame bait...
I reality, 95% of your driver code could have been merged
without problems, but you refused to take the small, objectionable
part out of the picture.
(For those interested:
http://mcentral.de/~mrec/patches/v4l-dvb/hg_v4l-dvb-experimental_01.patch
The patch changed the internal tuner API and required changes
to all tuner drivers.)
Your all-or-nothing approach didn't work out.
Out of curiosity: How does your userspace approach solve
the hybrid (analog/digital TV) tuner problem which was the
only objectionable part of your work? And why are the kernel
parts of your new interface now less objectionable? What changed?
