Feel free to help out if you think the NFS development effort is
understaffed.

A list of these 700+ unused exported APIs would be very useful so that
we can deprecate and/or get rid of them.
Concerning this case, though, and to make what I said in the earlier
mails (a lot) more explicit.
If you unexport flock_lock_file_wait(), then you might as well back out
the entire bloody ->flock() changeset instead because keeping the
->flock() VFS override support without the functionality to make
implementation practical (which is what you appear to want to do) is a
waste of more than 70 bytes of memory.
Now please go and figure out what it is you actually want to do here.
