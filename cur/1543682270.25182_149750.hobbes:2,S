Only in 2.4.22pre6aa2: 9999900_drm-4.3-1.gz
	No matter how I configure the kernel, I lose the direct
	rendering with this patch. Tried with DRM 4.1/4.3/4.0,
	it never works (and I don't have time for more tests for this right
	now as I'm leaving for the KS in around 5 hours). Not that I use 3d
	frequently but I postponed it for now, until I get more feedback. The
	patch is still in the 2.4.22pre6aa2 directory and it can be applied on
	top of 2.4.22pre7aa1 trivially to test. One detail is that I link
	everything into the kernel, especially on my test boxes I never use
	modules.  As soon as this mistery is solved I can add it back.
Only in 2.4.22pre6aa2: 9999900_ecc-20020904-2.gz
Only in 2.4.22pre7aa1: 9999900_ecc-20030225-1.gz
	Fixup some incorrect diffing (s/p0/p1) and renamed to the right date.
