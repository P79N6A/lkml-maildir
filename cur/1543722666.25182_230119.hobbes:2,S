correct. I checked with my contacts here on the PCI express requirements.
Apparently the spec says "A PCI Express Endpoint operating as the
Requester of a Memory Transaction is required to be capable of
generating addresses greater than 4GB", but my contact claims this is a
"soft" requirement.
but even if all PCI-X and PCI-E devices properly addressed the full
64-bits, legacy 32-bit PCI devices can be plugged into the motherboards as
well. my Intel em64t boards have mostly PCI-X, but 1 PCI slot and my amd
x86_64 have all PCI slots (aside from the main PCI-E slot).
also, at least one motherboard manufacturer claims PCI-E + AGP, but the AGP
is really just an AGP form-factor slot on the PCI bus.
Thanks,
Terence
