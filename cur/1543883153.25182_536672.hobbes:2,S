The first is a straightforward one-line regexp, as is the last:
^extern \w.*\w\(
return\s?\(
The middle one is a bit trickier. Basically, we don't want people
doing either:
extern int capital_of_assyria;
int sir_not_appearing_in_this_module();
in .c files. The first of those two is easy, provided you can figure
out the file type. And both are possible with multiline regexps.
This whole thing would be quite a bit more powerful if your search
function joined all the lines together, did a potentially multiline
search, then calculated the line numbers from the search results. Then
you could search for things like:
if (...)
{
if (...) {
  single_statement;
}
Looking forward to fully-automated pedantry. This should probably live
in scripts/.
