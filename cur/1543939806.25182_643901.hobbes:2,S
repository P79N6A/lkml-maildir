Subject: [PATCH] [0/18] Implement some low hanging BKL removal fruit in fs/*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/244

[Andrew: I believe this is -mm material for .25]
- Convert some more file systems (generally those who don't use the BKL
for anything except mount) to use unlocked_bkl.
- Implement BKL less fasync (see patch for the rationale) 
This is currently a separate entry point, but since the number of fasync
users in the tree is relatively small I hope the older entry point can
be removed then in the not too far future
[help from other people converting more fasync users to unlocked_fasync
would be appreciated]
- Implement BKL less remote_llseek
- While I was at it I also added a few missing compat ioctl handlers
- Fix a few comments
This fixes a lot of relatively trivial BKL users in fs/*. The main 
remaining non legacy offenders are now locks.c, nfs/nfsd and reiserfs.
I believe BKL removal for all of those is being worked on by other people.
Also a lot of "legacy" file systems still use it, but converting those
does not seem to be very pressing.
