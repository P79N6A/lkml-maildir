Thanks of your patch! 
I tested my home machine with kernel 2.0.36 that patch, and I found
a bug. Quota goes up and works without problems but when I tried put down
quota(with quotaoff -avug command), command halt(samewith umount command) 
and the quotas are not on anymore. Then I tried to put on quota(with
quotaon -avug command) I got "Device or Resource busy" error. Can you help
me with this?
Sincerely,
