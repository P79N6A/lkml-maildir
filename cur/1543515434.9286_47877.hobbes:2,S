Hello,
I'm curious if there is a problem booting off kernels
2.2.12 and 2.3.26 off the device /dev/hdb1.
This boots find when I use 2.3.16, so I'm assuming that
the recent boot code has some effect on this process.
The error code (from memory) I get is 0x00, which is also
the same code I get when I install Linux above cylinder 1024.
I'm using LILO that's off RH 6.1.
What's up ?
Thanks.
bill
