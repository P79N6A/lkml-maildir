This suggestion doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
We're looking to see if a task has dirtied most of the
pages in the nodes it is allowed to use.  If it has, then
we want to start pushing pages to the disk harder, and
slowing down the tasks writes.
What would it mean to do this per-node?  And why would
that be better?
