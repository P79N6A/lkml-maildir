Now, that was trivial to fix, and I will reply with a patch (which will have
Cc's trimmed to just the MLs and Richard).
But really, should not the backlight *class* be doing the initial update of
the brightness?  Looks like something that every device would need to do if
the class doesn't do it, and unlike the "power it off on unregister" thing,
I can't think of a reason not to do it for every backlight class device.
Please ACK the ibm-acpi patch in my next message if you'd like me to submit
it to Len Brown for merging into 2.6.21, or NACK it if you'd rather do it in
the backlight class core.
