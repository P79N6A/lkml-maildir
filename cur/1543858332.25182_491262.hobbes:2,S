Umm ... and you're trying to use the current X model for a positive

So let's come out and ban binary modules, rather than pussyfooting
around, if that's what we actually want to do.
It comes down to a question of whether we have enough leverage to push
them into doing what we want, or not - are we prepared to call their
bluff?
The current half-assed solution of chipping slowly away at things by
making them EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL one by one makes little sense - would
be better if we actually made an affirmative decision one way or the
other. And yes, I know which side of that argument you'd fall on ;-)

I don't see how this really any different than letting them create
GPL shims to export data to binary modules (aside from all the legal
wanking over minutae details, which really isn't that interesting).
