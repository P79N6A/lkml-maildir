I don't think this is a SCSI problem.  Your backtrace doesn't include
anything in the SCSI subsystem (this doesn't _prove_ anything, but does
suggest you should look elsewhere first).  You also didn't mention what
SCSI controller you were using.  If you can reproduce the oops without
using reiserfs at all, that would suggest the problem doesn't lie in
reiserfs, but that's where I'd blame first ;-)
