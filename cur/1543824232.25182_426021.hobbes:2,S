So it is better to use only one battery (or an array thereof) which is
sort of charged and discharged at the same time, or is this idea just as
screwed..? I don't have a degree in electronics, mind you : )
Might be easier to build something that keeps a battery well maintained
and switches in case of power outage. With large enough condensors to
bridge the gap, which would also iron out any peaks and stuff, this
should work pretty well.
Kind regards,
Chris
