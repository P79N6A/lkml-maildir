I can't really see the logic in this, though I know a lot of people do
it.  I try to stay consistent, thus I do:
if ()
for ()
case ()
while ()
sizeof ()
typeof ()
since they're all parts of the language, rather than
functions/macros or invocations of such.

Of course, coding-style is religion, and religion as a topic is a
sure-fire way to turn every civil conversation into full out battle,
so I've begun building a bomb-shelter where I'm going to spend the next
few months...
