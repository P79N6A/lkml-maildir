A bit extended version:
In the process in making it work I saw ~10% vmlinux size reductions
(which basically matches what Marcelo says) when I wasn't retaining
sections needed for EXPORT_SYMBOLs, but module loading didn't work.
Thus I fixed that by adding KEEP() directives so that EXPORT_SYMBOLs
are never discarded. This was just one of many fixes until kernel
started to actually boot and work.
I did that before I posted patches to lkml.
IOW: posted patches are not broken versus module loading.
