Hi,
	There seems to a problem in the kernel version checking in the
shell
code used in the pcmciautils version 13.
The file (pcmciautils-013/doc/cardmgr-to-pcmciautils.txt) mentions the
following way of kernel version checking:
	  KVERREL=`uname -r`
        KVER=${KVERREL%-*}
        KVER_MAJOR=${KVER%.*}
        KVER_MINOR=${KVER##*.}
        if [ "$KVER_MAJOR" == "2.6" ]; then
                # kernel 2.6.13-rc1 and higher have pcmcia via
/sbin/hotplug
                if [ $KVER_MINOR -ge 13 ]; then
                        # uncomment the following line if the driver for
your
                        # controller is not auto-loaded. or if you want
to be
                        # able to say /etc/init.d/pcmcia stop
                        /etc/init.d/pcmcia-new $1
                        exit 0
                fi
        fi
The problem is that this checking would fail on kernel versions
2.6.15.4( the one i use )or versions which have a subminor version as
well. This checking is very specific to kernel versions 2.6.x-rc1. The
current checking fails in my case, even though i'm using 2.6.15.4 (where
the minor number > 13).This is because KVER gets the string preceeding
the '-' (whether it exists or not in uname -r). In my case KVER would
assume the value 2.6.15.4 and subsequently KVER_MAJOR would become
2.6.15 which would never equate with 2.6 (in the if condtion) and always
lead to failure to run /etc/init.d/pcmcia-new $1.
The result is that the pcmcia-new script is not executed and the cardmgr
continues to get used.
This error checking has not been rectified in pcmciautils version 14 as
well.
I wonder how pccard daemon has been working for people using the above
code
on kernel 2.6.x.y
I would suggest the following replacement for the above checking:
        KVER_MAJOR1=`uname -r | cut -d "." -f1`
        KVER_MAJOR2=`uname -r | cut -d "." -f2`
        KVER_MAJOR=$KVERMAJOR1.$KVER_MAJOR2
        KVER_MINOR=`uname -r | cut -d "." -f3`
        if [ "$KVER_MAJOR" == "2.6" ]; then
                # kernel 2.6.13-rc1 and higher have pcmcia via
/sbin/hotplug
                if [ $KVER_MINOR -ge 13 ]; then
                        # uncomment the following line if the driver for
your
                        # controller is not auto-loaded. or if you want
to be
                        # able to say /etc/init.d/pcmcia stop
                        #/etc/init.d/pcmcia-new $1
                        exit 0
                fi
        fi
I had posted this message some time back but i realised i had used the
wrong 
mail-posting convention.As a result i didn't get any feedback. Therefore
i am 
putting up this post again. Sorry for reposting.
