Bummer. This is rubbish. And I am sure that this is not the intention of
Linus comments. IF the module would be NON functional without the closed
plugin, then yes, rip it out. But it is useable, and this hook *can* be
used for closed modules, but also for other modules. 
It really looks like personal stuff going on here, not really objective
discussion on this point.

And who will take over the level of support that Nemosoft has put into
this driver without the internal knowledge of the device? Good luck.
