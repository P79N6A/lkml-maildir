Microsoft may not but the standard of Taiwanese driver code (and by
reference I mean vendor reference not OS supplier reference) is not
always great. When you have weeks to write a driver for a product with a
6 month sales lifetime I guess there are other pressures on driver
authors.
Easy enough for Intel to analyse though.
