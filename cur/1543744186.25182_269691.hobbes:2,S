Yes, I perfectly agree with you. However, there are, for 2.6, the security 
fixes which are needed.
Well, it is possible that 2.6.10 (or even 2.6.11) will make again old UML 
binaries work. I.e., this is my hope, but no code is ready for this, yet.
In fact, Linus always said "binary compatibility is important".
UML was using a strange undocumented, and unwanted interface, but this is not 
a good reason for the kernel to break it. I think they did not even notice 
that. Also, however, I find that the breakage is a real bug.
The splitout version of the patches is available, and the 
uml-hang-on-2.6.9-host.patch is the one to apply. For 2.4, it cannot be 
applied separately, though (it requires one of the current incrementals, 
which is included in the patchset).
Unfortunately, it does not work on most kernel versions - it can be adapted, 
though, and if I find time, I will.
