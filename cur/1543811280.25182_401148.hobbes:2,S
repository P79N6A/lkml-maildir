So what do I do when I take my US laptop and fly to country X, which
has comletely different rules for these radios?  Do I have to re-flash
my firmware to make it work properly?  
The big problem is the lack of global unity, but that will slowly get
fixes as more countries realize it's a problem.  The big issue will be
military/govt radio spectrum users, they won't want to move if they
can help it.
