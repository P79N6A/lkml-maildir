So in Solaris, the scanner is going to eventually wake up as long as your
doing filesystem I/O, it's just a question of how long it takes to reach
lotsfree.
During that time it caches anything and everything in physical memory.
Are you implying that it should be looking for pages to swap out this whole
time to free up more space for filesystem and executable pages purely based
on lru? Have you done testing to prove that this is a better approach than
setting a threshold of when to wake up the lru mechanism?

Solaris keeps dirty pages after they have been flushed to their backing
store, it's just when the system has to choose something to flush that it
preferences filesystem over anonymous and executable, what's wrong with
that?

Interesting ...
