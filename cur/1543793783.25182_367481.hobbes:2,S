It's still there in 2.6.15-rc1-git3 (the sem is the down_read of
ioctl32_sem in fs/compat.c).
No, the problem was unique to the rt patch.  In -rt the default
down_read is just like a down (since it is very hard to do PI on readers
and writer locks).  So the solution in -rt was to convert this back to a
normal RW sem.
