To quote from your previous mail:

That doesn't really like documented interfaces to me. The SuSE kernel 
build system may be unconventional, but so far you failed miserably to 
prove that they did anything wrong. You should actually be thankful to 
them, that you can fix your broken build scripts to use _documented_ 
interfaces.
