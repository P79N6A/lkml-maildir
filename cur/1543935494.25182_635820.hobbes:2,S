Can you put this somewhere else please? I know there are already some
test files in kernel/* but imho they all belong into some other directory.
+	if (!err)
+		init_test_probes();
 	return err;
Couldn't this be just a normal initcall? Perhaps even a module_init(),
then it would be possible to use as a module too.
