Agreed.
The thing is quite simple, the moment we support xpmem the complexity
in the mmu notifier patch start and there are hacks, duplicated
functionality through the same xpmem callbacks etc... GRU can already
be 100% supported (infact simpler and safer) with my patch.

Yes, that's why I kept maintaining my patch and I posted the last
revision to Andrew. I use pte/tlb locking of the core VM, it's
unintrusive and obviously safe. Furthermore it can be extended with
Christoph's stuff in a 100% backwards compatible fashion later if needed.
