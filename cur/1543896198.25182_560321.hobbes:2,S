Maybe that's because I don't really see any up sides.
As I see it, if we prevent tivoization, then the most likely outcome
will be that a very few number of vendors will switch to ROM based
solutions or similar (everyone lose, both vendor and user), a few
vendors that currently tivoize hardware may open up their hardware but
I doubt that will be very many, and the vast majority of vendors will
move to *BSD or proprietary software since they simply can't or won't
open up their hardware.
So no, I don't think there are any upsides. We'll lose a huge number
of developers, testers and users inside the business comunity and
we'll lose a lot of exposure (like "hey, did you know TiVO actually
runs Linux inside? Isn't that cool?)...  Gaining a few hobyists at the
expense of driving a huge number of businesses away from GPL'ed
software does not look like an upside to me.

Just because I come to a different conclusion than you doesn't
nessesarily make it wrong.

No, it is not. When I wrote that I meant "don't want" as in "really
don't want to since it'll destroy our business" or "really really
don't want to since we would be breaking the law" etc.

Most people don't care about hacking their devices, and of the few who
do only a subset have the skill and only a subset of those will
actually contribute anything back. This is a *small* set of people and
gaining that small set at the expense of losing the large number of
contributers from various companies doesn't make sense to me.

Not as long as I want to prevent the user from tampering with it, no.

But do you really expect a vendor to put a device on the market where
they also lock themselves out of upgrading it and releasing new
software for it?  That's just rediculous.

See above.

For a few select individuals that may be true. But for the majority of
the population it won't mean a thing.

I'm sorry, but I don't think it holds water.

Contrary to you, I don't believe any significant number of companies
will do that. It's simply better for business to just use other
software in that case.
