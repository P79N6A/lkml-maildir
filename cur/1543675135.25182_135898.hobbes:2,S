With all due respect, 'screw x440 et al'. The fact remains that a
majority of users won't even know what an x440 _is_, let alone
need to configure for one.  If someone has actually ended up with
one of those, I'd like to think they at least have enough clue to
know what it is they've just spent their megabucks on.

That's precisely what I was saying.  I think we're in agreement,
in a roundabout 'same but different' sort of way. I think.
