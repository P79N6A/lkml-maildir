Below is the patch to rid tty_register_devfs and tty_unregister_devfs of the 
tty_struct local.
I still think that treating it as critical deserves consideration because it's 
a potentially nasty problem, and one that could be tough to debug.  As Alan 
pointed out, it's easier to fix the bug than it is to prove that it can't 
happen on any of the other arches.
