well ... so ... it will check, every time slice or so,
whether it should give up the CPU, right?  That is, the
code sched.c scheduler() does run every slice or so, right?

Well ... not exactly "check the cpus_allowed mask" because that
mask is no longer something we can change from another process,
with Ingo's latest scheduler.
Rather check some other task field.  Say we had a
"proposed_cpus_allowed" field of the task_struct, settable by
any process (perhaps including an associated lock, if need be).
Say this field was normally set to zero, but could be
set to some non-zero value by some other process wanting
to change the current process cpus_allowed.  Then in the
scheduler, at the very bottom of schedule(), check to see if
current->proposed_cpus_allowed is non-zero.  If it is, use
set_cpus_allowed() to set cpus_allowed to the proposed value.
[I am painfully aware that I am not an expert in this code,
 so please be gentle if I'm spouting gibberish ...]

How about not changing anything of the target task synchronously,
except for some new "proposed_cpus_allowed" field.  Set that
field and get out of there.  Let the target process run the
set_cpus_allowed() routine on itself, next time it passes through
the schedule() code.  Leave it the case that the set_cpus_allowed()
routine can only be run on the current process.
Perhaps others need this cpus_allowed change (and the migration
of a task to a different allowed cpu) to happen "right away".
But I don't, and I don't (yet) know that anyone else does.

And the need for this (sched_move_task()) also seems minimal.

Isn't it customary in Linux kernel work to minimize the number
of locks -- avoid replication unless there is a genuine need
(a hot lock, say) to replicate locks?  We don't routinely add
features because they are easy -- we add them because they are
needed.
