Hi, Alan.
    Thank you for yours efforts to support this patch code.
    I sent our patch file as attachment for you reference.
    I saw the 'patch-2.4.19-pre2-ac3' and it has build-in Maxtor 48 bit lba
spec. Is these patch will be build into next kernel version 2.4.19?
Do you want us to make a patch for the 'patch-2.4.19-pre2-ac3'?
Best Regards
Hank Yang
