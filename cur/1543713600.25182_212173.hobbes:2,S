Can't you just use the pci_dev->resource regions for this?

Again, there's already ways of getting to this from the pci_dev.
Simply wander up through pdev->bus->self until you get to a self that
is NULL and you've found a root bus.  Alternatively, you might just look
at PCI_CONTROLLER() on ia64.

For consistency, how about naming these functions pci_clear_errors()
and pci_check_errors()?  PCI-Express has similar error-checking abilities
and I'd hate to see two extremely similar capabilities at war with each
other over unacceoptable names ;-)

I really don't think we want another readX variant.  Do we then also
add readX_check_relaxed()?  Can't we just pretend the MCA is asynchronous
on ia64?  I'm sure we'd get better performance.
