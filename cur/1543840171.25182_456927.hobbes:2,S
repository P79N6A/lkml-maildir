It 99.9+% likely a hardware or BIOS or power supply/VRM/cooling
problem of some sort. So many DIMMs are quite stress full
to the system and can expose issues which were hidden before.
Or you might run into some other BIOS/hardware issue.
You can post the exact text of the panics from a serial console
if you want, but most likely you will get the same answer even then.
I would start talking to your hardware vendor.

The kernel doesn't know anything about DIMMs, it just gets a memory
map from the BIOS.
