Actually I think this was already possible as of a couple of
months ago, but thanks for doing the cleanup :)
Fix was embarrassingly simple as pointed out by Linus:
-#define CPU_MASK_ALL	{ {[0 ... CPU_ARRAY_SIZE-1] = ~0UL} }
-#define CPU_MASK_NONE	{ {[0 ... CPU_ARRAY_SIZE-1] =  0UL} }
+#define CPU_MASK_ALL	((cpumask_t) { {[0 ... CPU_ARRAY_SIZE-1] = ~0UL} })
+#define CPU_MASK_NONE	((cpumask_t) { {[0 ... CPU_ARRAY_SIZE-1] =  0UL} })
