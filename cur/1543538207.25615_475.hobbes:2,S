Someone who understands the PC KBD controller should answer that. It
looks like command/read/ack cycles should not be interspersed with
other KBD accesses. That would not be an unreasonable hardware
limitation.
So with all that locking, the ISR may have to wait a long time for the
lock to yield. Even if other interrupts are not blocked, this will
still delay BH/tasklet processing, not to mention scheduling
latencies.
Someone more familiar with the current IRQ subsystem could help here:
- what happens if the interrupt handler does nothing with the
  keyboard: does the interrupt keep banging the CPU and hence the
  handler keeps getting run
- can we block delivery of an interrupt, so that other interrupts and
  process rescheduling continues as normal?
