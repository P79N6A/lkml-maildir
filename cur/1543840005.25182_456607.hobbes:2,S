Yes, but the problem gets far worse.  You don't need to worry about just 
those.  You need to worry about all that C code that runs in the native 
paravirt-ops as well, because you could have preempted it in the middle 
of a callout.  And the paravirt_ops code isn't isolated in a separate 
section (though it well could be).
