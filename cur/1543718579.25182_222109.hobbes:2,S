If only this were true... but there are how many million Windows users?
Oh, and if they're too stupid to count, there are also large numbers of
HP-UX, AIX, Solaris and other proprietary UNIX variants out there, not
to mention IBM mainframe and AS/400 shops...
Oh, and if you only mean Linux users, we'll ignore all the ATI Radeon
and Nvidea sufferers, and vmware users, and winmodem users, and every
driver for a device which loads firmware, and every PC which does not
release source code for the BIOS, and . . .
Arguments tend to loose a lot of their impact when based on religion
rather than realism.
