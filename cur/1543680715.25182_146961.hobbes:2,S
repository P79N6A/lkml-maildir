Hi Linus !
I'm quite concerned about Power Management. Patrick haven't yet merged
the new implementation which changes the driver-side semantics to
something sane and your above mail seem to imply this is now too late.
While I agree these should have been merged a lot earlier, I'm also
annoyed by the fact that the existing save_state/suspend semantics
are just plain broken...
What do you plan on this regard ? Patrick, do you still need to hold
your patch until OLS ? They should get in now, that won't prevent
you from doing your paper ;)
Ben.
