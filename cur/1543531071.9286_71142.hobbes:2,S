Right... What (fixed) size do you set the stack to?

So? If you touch the memory, overcommit doesn't come into play.

In which case, terminating it abruptly doesn't cause any significant

The point is, your process CAN die for a whole variety of reasons,
including the sysadmin deciding you are hogging resources and kill9ing
you.

Disabling overcommit makes every process take up a bit more memory, so
you run out much sooner. Then things start dying. If you aren't making
ANY syscalls, then you are OK (provided you aren't killed for resource
hogging etc.) - but that was true anyway, unless the machine is
overloaded.

It is not inefficient; if you have disabled overcommit, you are just
performing an extra 100k instructions. 1ms of execution at
initialisation. And it DOES work.

At which point, it DOES handle being killed gracefully - so there's no
problem anyway.

No, because they have already been allocated. You can only die when
you access UNallocated pages, thus trying to allocate them.

I am trying to point out why it doesn't achieve what you think it
does, and it comes at much greater expense than you suggest.
