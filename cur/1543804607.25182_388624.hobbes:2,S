clone_<namespace>  , so its neither nor ...
Essentially creating a new namespace ! That's what Eric was suggesting.

That's a reasonable approach. Give the general capability (since C/R + migration
is an additional capability that might not be utilized by many) and leave it to
the sys_admin to specify what is allowed or not

Something like it .. yes...
