This particular bug has already been fixed in the rewrite, as I originally
said back on 14 November 2001.
The patch does fine for the most part, but I have two worries:
1. the possibilities of pushing through changes in the IO or memory space
   by changing the other space at the same time. (ie, port = 1, iomem =
   0xfe007c00 and you already have a line at port = 0, iomem = 0xfe007c00).
   I delt with this properly using the resource management subsystem.
2. there seems to be a lack of security considerations for changing the
   iomem address.  (ie, changing the iomem address without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
   I added this as an extra check for change_port)

I have a fair bit of email backed up at the moment, but I have been in
contact with Ted T'so recently.  I won't say much more at the moment,
but should have something in a month or two.  Until then I'd rather not
say too much publically.
