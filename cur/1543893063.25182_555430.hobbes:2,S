Lots of other subsystem can allocate a lot of memory
and they usually don't cooperate and have similar dirty limit concepts.
So you could run out of usable memory anyways and then have a similar
issue.
For example a flood of network packets could always steal your
GFP_ATOMIC pools very quickly in the background (gigabit or 10gig 
can transfer a lot of data very quickly) 
Also iirc try_to_free_pages() is not completely fair and might fail
under extreme load for some requesters.
Not requiring memory allocation for any IO would be certainly safer.
Anyways, it's a theoretic question because you can't sleep in 
there anyways unless something drastic changes in the driver interfaces.
