Subject: Kernel should not set TERM=linux (Re: terminal problem)

Most of the gettys for Linux don't seem to have ever been tested with a
physical terminal and usually have very undesriable effects. For example
some do the following:
  1) Ignore /etc/ttytype 'cause the kernel has already set 'linux'
OBKernel: IMO the kernel should NOT set the terminal type any more, 
          init/getty, telnetd and rlogind are by far better places.
	  With the existance of serial and printer consoles having
	  the terminal type defined during /etc/rc has become stupidly
	  dangerous.
  2) Keep writing records to wtmp if the terminal is turned off, eventually
     restarting so often that init disables the inittab line.
  3) Ignoring a positive DTR/DSR transition and not transmitting a banner
     until the user types a CR.
  4) Ignoring a negitive DTR/DSR transition by not setting CLOCAL and
     HUPCL for the /bin/login program.
  5) Keep timing out the input on the terminal line every 60 seconds while
     DTR/DSR is active again filling up wtmp with useless records and 
     possibly causing itself to be disabled by init when the terminal is
     left turned on.
None of the standard ones supposedly designed for seial ports actually seem
to work correctly. The 'mingetty' program seems to do the right thing but
it doesn't have speed setting or speed change on BREAK. So I grabbed the
source and hardwired the speed to 115k2 and it works perfectly now.
