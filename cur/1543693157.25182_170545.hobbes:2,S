OK I built with that and here are the results:
1. The ehci-hcd driver fails in exactly the same place.
2. It was still v. unstable, which led me to investigate why (since I'm 
pretty sure the hardware is good & the suse compiler is supposed to be a 
good one).  I started stripping out options until eventually I found 
that it's devfs that's the culprit - with that enabled I get random 
compile errors every few seconds.  With it disabled the compile works 
perfectly, even with the debian compiler (tried -j20 and -j255 and both 
passed).
My first guess was you can't use a 32bit devfsd with a 64bit kernel, but 
stopping devfsd didn't seem to make a whole lot of difference to the 
stability... only compiling out the entire devfs system solved it.
I suppose it could be insmod breaking the ehci-hcd... I'll see if I can 
find a pure 64bit one (presumably suse have one) rather than the biarch 
one that debian uses.
