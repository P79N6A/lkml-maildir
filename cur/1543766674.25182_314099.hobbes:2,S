It's a desirable objective, but the implementation is wrong.  If we have
a user mount that must be known to the VFS so that the VFS can enforce
the right restrictions instead of leaving various crude hacks in lowlevel
filesystem drivers.  Especially as fuse isn't the only filesystem for which
this makes sense - smbfs or v9fs want the same features aswell
