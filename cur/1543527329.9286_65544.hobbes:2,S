Maybe you read

If not, you should.

No doubt the drive itself says nothing at all, that is, it comes with
the dummy report 16383/16/63. The 4982/255/63 would then be the LBA
translation invented by your BIOS. The translations with 240 heads
are typically a result of asking the BIOS for Large instead of LBA.
hdparm -g will tell you what Linux reports as geometry.
The 240 heads that Linux invented may be from the partition table,
or they may be from the BIOS.
Anyway, it looks as if you have a confused setup where part of your
system thinks H=255 and part thinks H=240.
You can always force Linux' idea of the geometry by giving boot
parameters. But Linux does not use the geometry, only tells
LILO about it, and you can also tell LILO about it yourself.
Or you can give LILO the "linear" keyword, so that it does not
need a geometry at all. Make sure you have LILO v21 - earlier
versions have an integer overflow.
Two or three attempts should suffice to make things work.
In case you post again, "dmesg | grep hdb" gives the required
information about what Linux thinks, and "hdparm -I /dev/hdb"
and "hdparm -i /dev/hdb" give the disk report.

Beware: in case you have built-in SCSI and both IDE and SCSI disks,
the BIOS reports about "disk 0" and "disk 1" (that is, e.g., int 13
with 0x80 or 0x81) may actually report on SCSI disks.
Thus, what Linux gets from the BIOS is useless in the general situation -
we have no easy way of finding out for what disk the report is.
