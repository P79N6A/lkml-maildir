Hi Steve, 
Chris Clayton send me the patch below and asked if I could forward it for 
him.
Since Chris' original patch was whitespace damaged I've rediffed it 
against 2.6.10-bk4 
I've kept Chris' comments on the patch below but substituted his original 
with my re-diffed version and added my own Signed-off-by line since the 
patch looks good to me.

<text irrelevant to the patch snipped>
I saw the patch you submitted ealier this week to remove two unnecessary 
assignments from fs/cifs/file.c. Whilst looking over the original source 
file, I think I've spotted two more of these assignments. The patch below is 
against virgin 2.6.10 (i.e it doesn't have your earlier whitespace patch 
applied), so you may have to fix it up a bit to get it to apply to your tree.
Thanks,
Chris
