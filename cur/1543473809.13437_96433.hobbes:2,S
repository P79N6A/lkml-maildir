The problem is that I screwed up in the arch/i386/config.in file:
there's a line that reads something like
	if [ "$CONFIG_M386" != "n" ]; then
and it should obviously test for != "y" (ie just change the "n" to a "y").
As it is, it does exactly the wrong thing, resulting in (a) i386
machines not working and (b) non-i386 compiles having the extra cruft
only needed for i386. 
Duh. Colour me embarrassed,
