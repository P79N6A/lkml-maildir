Ok, that's why I as asking

I have some boxes that routinely sit with 3,500-4,000 processes (fork 
heavy workload, ~1400 forks/sec so far) that topple over when they go much 
over 10,000 processes.
I'm only running 32 bit kernels with 1G of ram available, (no himem), I've 
been assuming that ram was my limiting factor, but it hasn't been 
enough of an issue to really track down yet :-)
