I have resolved my 2 problems. I have included abbreviated versions 
below for reference.
Problem 1 was solved by workaround.
1.) Compile 3w-xxxx as a module and nothing complains (on both systems)
2.) Add a modprobe 3w-xxxx early in rc.sysinit and it gets loaded before 
anything important happens (boot drive is separate IDE, so this scheme 
works for me)
3.) On some machines (1 of 2), mkinitrd still reports the error quoted 
below when trying to put 3w-xxxx into the kernel. On all machines (2 of 
2) using 3w-xxxx modules, the kernel does not automagically load the 
modules on boot. I presume it's not supposed to. Of course, the first 
hangup means that one cannot boot from the 3w-xxxx array. I do not have 
a problem with this, but it bears considering, because some folks might 
want to do it.
Problem 2 was my fault.
I still had FreeS/WAN starting up in my rc5.d from the 2.4.x setup that 
I had and that seemed to be killing network communications. Turning that 
off seemed to fix things.
