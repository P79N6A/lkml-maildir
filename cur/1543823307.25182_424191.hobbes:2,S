Following Ingo's example I have included the modified test case (please see 
the original mail for librt.h) that starts the trace before each sleep and 
disables it after we wake up.  If we have missed a period, we print the 
trace.
My initial trace (lt_01.log.bz2) contained entries like the following:
  <idle>-0     2...1   24us!: default_idle (cpu_idle)
  <idle>-0     2D..1 1609us : smp_apic_timer_interrupt (c0100c80 0 0)
  <idle>-0     2...1 1635us!: default_idle (cpu_idle)
  <idle>-0     2D..1 4756us : smp_apic_timer_interrupt (c0100c80 0 0)
I noticed the that there were long latencies (as high as 3ms) all related to 
irq handling in the idle loop.  I thought it might have something to do with 
the CPU going into some kind of a sleep state and taking a long time to wake 
up.  John Stultz suggested I boot with idle=poll.
The idle=poll trace (lt_02.log.bz2) had much smaller maximum latencies, like 
the following:
  <idle>-0     0D..1 1341us+: write_watchdog_counter (nmi_watchdog_tick)
  <idle>-0     0D..1 1441us : do_nmi (poll_idle)
  <idle>-0     0D..1 1445us+: write_watchdog_counter (nmi_watchdog_tick)
  <idle>-0     0D..1 1545us : do_nmi (poll_idle)
All the longest latencies were related to the nmi watchdogs.  Booting with 
idle=poll nmi_watchdog=0 unfortunately seemed to return to the original 
behavior - so perhaps the second test was just a fluke.  This trace 
(lt_03.log.bz2) had entries like the following:
  <idle>-0     1...1   19us!: poll_idle (cpu_idle)
  <idle>-0     1D..1 1089us : smp_apic_timer_interrupt (c0100ccf 0 0)
  <idle>-0     1...1 1113us!: poll_idle (cpu_idle)
  <idle>-0     1D..1 4765us : smp_apic_timer_interrupt (c0100ccf 0 0)
sched_la-2978  1D... 4798us!: init_fpu (math_state_restore)
sched_la-2978  1D... 5088us : smp_apic_timer_interrupt (4b3b98e8 0 0)
sched_la-2978  1D.h. 5103us!: irq_exit (smp_apic_timer_interrupt)
sched_la-2978  1.... 5719us > sys_clock_gettime (00000001 b7f65378 0000007b)
Finally I booted with idle=poll and nmi_watchdog=0.  The very first run 
failed, (I've noticed that the first iteration seems to always hit PERIOD 
MISSED! while the second usually passes fine).  It's still running a 1M 
iteration run with no more failures so far (100K so far).
The latency tracer is a very interesting tool.  I have a few 
questions/assumptions I'd like to run by you to make sure I understand the 
output of the latency trace:
o ! in the delay column means there is a long latency here?
o + in the delay column means there is a > 1us latency here?
o > means entering the kernel from a sys_call?
o < means returning from the sys_call?
o : is not < or >
o Why do I only see ~5ms of trace when it appears that I am seeing more like
  ~25ms between the time when I start and stop the trace?
o What are the maximum latencies that get printed to /var/log/messages?  What
  exacly do they measure? From what point to what point?
