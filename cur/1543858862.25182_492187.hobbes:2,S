As you probably know, the GPL, the FSF, RMS or even GPL "zealots" never tried 
to change or restrict "fair use". GPL[23] covers only to "distibution" of the 
covered program. The freedom #0 says explicitly: "right to use the program 
for any purpose".
So, I don't see any clash here between GPL/FSF/RMS with "fair use"
And you probably know that any GPLed code can be linked and executed with any 
other program, whatever is its license if it's for personal use (is that 
worse than "fair use"?). 
And even if there is a function in linux that disables loading of non GPL 
modules, it's still allowed under the GPL to distribute a kernel with those 
functions removed. Any user can load any other module in this kernel without 
worrying about "fair use" or "derived work", GPL allows her to do it.
So, where's the freaking relationship between GPL (or its "zealots") and "fair 
use"? Who is trying to re-define it?
FUD, FUD, FUD.
