Subject: 2.4.1 bug in mkdir(2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

mkdir("file", 02750) does not create a file with the set group id bit
set.  chmod("file", 02750) does.  Further more, mkdir(2) violates its
man page specification by not creating set-gid directories if the
parent directory has this bit set.
I suspect these are related.
Cheers,
Mike.
