Subject: Re: [PATCH scsi-misc-2.6 04/13] scsi: remove meaningless volatile qualifiers from structure definitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

04_scsi_remove_volatile.patch
	scsi_device->device_busy, Scsi_Host->host_busy and
	->host_failed have volatile qualifiers, but the qualifiers
	don't serve any purpose.  Kill them.  While at it, protect
	->host_failed update in scsi_error for consistency and clarity.
