While this patch does fix the problem, I would like to propose the
following attached patch instead, which is a minimal fix for the
specific race identified.
I have the following concerns about extending the lock page coverage:
Extending lock_page coverage 1) doesn't appear to protect from any other
races; 2) doesn't seem to be how the rest of the kernel submits asynch
writes; 3) isn't how this path used to do locking; and 4) can hold the
page lock for a long time while a request slot and memory is allocated.
What's more, if there *is* a good reason to extend lock page coverage,
then that should probably be sumbmitted as a seperate changeset on top
of this minimal patch, with a seperate rationale. It would help future
work on this code identify why the locking is the way it is.
Thanks,
Nick

When running
	fsstress -v -d $DIR/tmp -n 1000 -p 1000 -l 2
on an ext2 filesystem with 1024 byte block size, on SMP i386 with 4096 byte
page size over loopback to an image file on a tmpfs filesystem, I would
very quickly hit
	BUG_ON(!buffer_async_write(bh));
in fs/buffer.c:end_buffer_async_write
It seems that more than one request would be submitted for a given bh
at a time.
What would happen is the following:
2 threads doing __mpage_writepages on the same page.
Thread 1 - lock the page first, and enter __block_write_full_page.
Thread 1 - (eg.) mark_buffer_async_write on the first 2 buffers.
Thread 1 - set page writeback, unlock page.
Thread 2 - lock page, wait on page writeback
Thread 1 - submit_bh on the first 2 buffers.
=> both requests complete, none of the page buffers are async_write,
   end_page_writeback is called.
Thread 2 - wakes up. enters __block_write_full_page.
Thread 2 - mark_buffer_async_write on (eg.) the last buffer
Thread 1 - finds the last buffer has async_write set, submit_bh on that.
Thread 2 - submit_bh on the last buffer.
=> oops.
So change __block_write_full_page to explicitly keep track of the last
bh we need to issue, so we don't touch anything after issuing the last
request.
