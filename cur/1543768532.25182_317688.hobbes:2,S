The kernel is designed to be compiled with the GNU 'C' compler
supplied with every distribution. It uses a lot of __asm__()
statements and other GNU-specific constructions.
Why would you even attempt to convert the kernel sources to
be compiled with some other tools? Also C++ won't work because
the kernel is all about method, i.e., procedures. You need
a procedural compiler for most of it, not an object-oriented
one.
