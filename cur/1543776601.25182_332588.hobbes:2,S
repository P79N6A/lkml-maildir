Subject: [PATCH] ability to change SysRq scancode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i release this patch because my keyboard ("Mitsumi Electric Apple
Extended USB Keyboard" Bus=0003 Vendor=05ac Product=0205 Version=0122)
doesn't have a PrintScr key, so cannot send the right scancode, and
KEY_SYSRQ needs to be modified.
i hope that i've done in the right way ;)
it's tested by me, and it's working, yeah i'm pressing the SAK with F13 :P

> 	  which should act as SysRq. You can find the scancode on your
