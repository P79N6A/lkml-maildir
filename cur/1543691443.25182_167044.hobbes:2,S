| Hi *,

I think that 'vi .config' and menuconfig get the most use.
I use xconfig occasionally, and have never used gconfig.
| -----------------
| - Using xconfig worked without problems. But IMHO some things are a bit
| disturbing:
| 
| -- Split-View: When do options appear in the left panel ("Support for
| USB Gadgets" and "Remove kernel Features")? It seems to me that these
| two are not a the right place there.
| Another thing: Sometimes Sub-Menus appear in a sub-field in the left
| tree-view (like Power Management -> CPU Frequency Scaling) and sometimes
| they only have an own sub-menu in the top-right panel (like Networking
| -> Ethernet (10 or 100 MBit)?
Yes, we could use more consistency there.
I find that sometimes it's easier to click on a different mehu item
completely than to up-level (backtrack) on a menu.
| -- Selecting "Code maturity level options -> Select only drivers
| expected to compile cleanly" is helpful but it would be nice if the
| config-system would show these drivers in a light grey (or something
| like that) and make them not-selectable.
I certainly like that suggestion.

Thanks.
