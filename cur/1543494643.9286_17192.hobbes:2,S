A 10.1 Gig IBM Deskstar 16 GP (model IBM-DTTA-351010) was jumpered for 16
heads as default but this PC didn't boot and I had to jumper it for 15
heads. hdparm -i tells RawCHS=16383/15/63 and LBAsects=19807200. I use
20960/15/63 to get the full capacity.
At home I had the same problem with a 8.4 Gig IBM disk: the pc didn't boot
until I jumpered it for 15 heads. Both the pc's use AMI bios and are not
exactly the latest models (one is a 486 and the other one is a pentium).
