I checked and /dev/null exists.  I also have libncursesw5 installed.
Oddly, I rebooted and when I ran make, the build proceeded.  I quit
and ran "make menuconfig" again.  As you suggested, this did break
my build process as before.  I had to reboot in order to complete the
build process.  Any other possibilities?
Thanks!
