Hi,
I noticed that almost all local disk file systems use the default
vfs_getattr()->generic_fillattr() to get file attributes. However,
vfs_getattr()->generic_fillattr() is not protected by a lock. Is this
problematic?
Suppose process A is getting file attributes, after it read the
"mtime" and before it read the i_size, the process is scheduled out,
and another process B cuts in, change the file, and cause the change
on file size. After A is switched back, it goes ahead to read the rest
fields. Now it will have an old "mtime" but a new "i_size".
Is this scenario possible? If so, will this cause serious problem to
the file system?
Thanks,
Xin
