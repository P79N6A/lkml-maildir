Because it was stated so in some ancient DOS docs? I really don't know.
x86-64 uses 1193182. This is because when I was doing x86-64 timing
code, I had observably better results with this number.

In that case, the table will look like this (with the CGA clock fixed to
14.31818000 MHz):
   HZ   ticks/jiffie  1 second      error (ppm)
---------------------------------------------------
   100      11932      1.000015365      15.4

   250       4773      1.000057270      57.3
   300       3978      1.000182984     183.0
   500       2387      1.000266794     266.8
  1000       1194      1.000685841     685.8

Yes, adding (12.0/14318180)*LATCH to xtime in each timer interrupt,
instead of (1.0/HZ) indeed eliminates the error entirely.

Going to HZ=864 would fix this problem. It would likely cause other
problems in places that expect 1/HZ to be a sane number, though.
