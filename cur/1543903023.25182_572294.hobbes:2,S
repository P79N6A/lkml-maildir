I'm sure it would be possibel to save a lot of text size. But I don't
think removing the relatively small CPUID code is the right way.
That is just a big maintenance issue for little gain.
If you're seriously interested you should start measuring and then
attack the real bloat pigs. e.g. a good way is to look for unneeded
inlining.
And also do regression testing, like running bloat-o-meter between
releases and complaining about subsystems which have grown unduly.
