ACPI still explodes on my old PII and stops it booting. (I've reported it
to Len a few times but he seems to be ignoring me).
Anyway, it is oopsing in drivers/acpi/scan.c line 207 where element
(which is NULL) gets dereferenced.
Adding a WARN_ON and return AE_BAD_PARAMETER for the element==NULL case
gives the following:
Badness in acpi_bus_extract_wakeup_device_power_package at drivers/acpi/scan.c:208

The ACPI bios on this thing has always seemed to be pretty broken, but
this at least allows the 'power' button to continue to work (the only
reason why I want ACPI).
Hmm... I don't want to hold up the release for this isolated problem.
Maybe if you're forced to do another -rc I could send in a trivial two
liner? (what's the policy with such a situation?)
