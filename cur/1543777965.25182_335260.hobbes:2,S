Dear Sir,
WhiteSmoke is unique, patented software that makes any plain text sophisticated, rich and professional with little effort from the user. WhiteSmoke includes text enrichment, word replacement, a built-in dictionary, spelling and grammar correction.
To view a demonstration of how WhiteSmoke works, click on the following link:  
http://web.whitesmoke.com/index.php
 
(Just type any text you want, press the WhiteSmoke button on the bottom, and left-click on the words that will become underlined).
Your site will be able to offer the WhiteSmoke writing solution to its users. This would significantly increase the attractiveness of your site and differentiate its name as a provider of advanced writing solutions as well as creating a competitive advantage.  
According to our studies this will significantly increase web site traffic and the number of returning customers.
I am looking forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Please email me at your convenience.
Chen Zur
Business Development Manager.
