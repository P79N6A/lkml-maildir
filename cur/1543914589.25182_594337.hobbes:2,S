Originally the BSD people wanted to share the interface for user space
compatibility.
The kernel however is GPL so the BSD licence on some bits of the code
isn't really relevant as the combination of bits you depend upon is GPL,
will remain GPL and the only way to do a binary module would be to show
it is not in any way a derivative work in law.
