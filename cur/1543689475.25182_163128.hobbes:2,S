According to my tests this bit makes no difference. For primary master
register B should be register 0x61 in PCI config space. When disk/adapter are
operating in UDMA5, values shown below are used - 0x24 in register B, and
disk accesses, and hdparm -i/-I and ide-smart -d /dev/hde works fine.
When I change this value to 0x34, I see no change in behavior, everything
still works.

Only problem I found is that if I do 'hdparm -p0 /dev/hde' followed by
'hdparm -d1 -X69 /dev/hde', IDE activity leds goes on, and kernel locks up.
I tried UP kernel with spinlock debugging, and I have enabled (APIC) NMI
watchdog, but it did no change - machine still locks up, and there is no
NMI watchdog message for at least one minute (NMI count in /proc/interrupts
increases, so I assume that it should work).
So I have no idea whether this Ross's patch should be applied or not. I see
no difference in behavior.
But it looks suspicious to me that PIO tuning clears lower 3 bits of 
register B, but then it sets bit 3 (for PIO1/2) or bit 4 (for PIO0). 
It means that if we use PIO3 after DMA mode, we use value 0x06 for TB, but if
we'll use PIO3 after PIO0 and PIO1 mode, we use value 0x1E for TB... Does
not look good to me. 
I think that these masks should match, and we should use 0xF0/0x0F for register
A and 0xE0/0x1F for register B (instead of 0xF0/0x07 we use currently). Otherwise
value of bits 4 & 3 or register B is almost random, and depends on previously
used mode, and thus Ross's patch is step in good direction.
