Hi John:
I will try mutt or mail when i want to send next patch. Most different of
ip100a.c
and sundance.c are almost same only fix some bugs. The different of ip100a
and ip100 is in phy. We can use one driver to support those two device, I
want
to know what is better for kernel:
1. Only updata sundance.c to support IP100A
2. Release ip100a.c which support ip100(sundance) to kernel 2.6.x and ask to
remove sundance.c.
3. Release ip100a.c with sundance.c both to kernel 2.6.x
We hope to use IP100a.c as our product driver, so 2. and 3. will better for
IC Plus. But we will still follow your suggestion, if you feel 1. was better
for kernel.
Jesse

One general comment is that your patch is whitespace-damaged,
undoubtedly mangled by your mailer.  I would suggest that you use
a text- or curses-based mailer (like mutt or even mail) for sending
patches, but I'm sure there are graphical mailers that can be trained
to not be "too smart".

This PCI ID table is identical to the one in the sundance driver.
What advantage does this driver offer over sundance?
Thanks,
John
