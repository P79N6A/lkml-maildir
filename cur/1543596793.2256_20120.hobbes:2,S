Another way might be to use the PnP BIOS to read and write the 
ESCD tables.  I wrote some code to do this a few years ago and
after beating up the code a bit more I can at least read the ESCD 
tables from the BIOS.  If anyone is interested in doing something 
with the code it can be found at:

The advantage of using the PnP BIOS is that the PnP BIOS knows
about the format of the data in BIOS and how to do all the 
chipset specific stuff.  The disadantage is as usual that a lot
of BIOSes are buggy.
