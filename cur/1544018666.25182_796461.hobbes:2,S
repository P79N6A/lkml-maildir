Hi,
The following two patches fix the allocation of interrupts in the PCIe port
driver, which is currently broken with respect to MSI-X.
The first patch introduces a new function returning the size of a device's
MSI-X table, which is used in the second patch.
The second one is the actual fix.
Please consider for applying.
Thanks,
Rafael
