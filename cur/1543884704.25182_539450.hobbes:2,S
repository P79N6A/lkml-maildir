I don't actively watch distributions, but I believe there are frequently
alternative drivers shipped.  How much sense that makes for FireWire is
another question.

It may actually be easier to let problem reporters (who cannot or don't
want to compile kernels) compare between different kernel releases,
rather than to ask them to compare between different stacks on top of
the same kernel.  Still, it potentially reduces the testers base.

Is the opportunity to clean up module names compelling enough, vs. (the
wish for) minimized trouble with scripts which refer to module names?

This applies mostly to <fw-core> vs. <ieee1394 + raw1394 + video1394 +
dv1394>.  The rest should look identical to the user, except that some
inapplicable module parameters (and bugs) were removed.
