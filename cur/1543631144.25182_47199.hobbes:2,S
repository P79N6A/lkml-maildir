Hi Peter,
 There are a bunch of fixes in my tree that have been either
 brought forward from 2.4, or have been submitted by janitors at
 some point. You may find that patch useful to begin with.
 If you just want the intermezzo specific bits, let me know
 off list and I'll cut it up into bits.
 (I'd rather shove this your way now than have to resync these fixes
  after whatever you're about to do. I don't want a repeat of what
  happened with reiserfs in my tree circa 2.5.3 8-)
    Dave.
