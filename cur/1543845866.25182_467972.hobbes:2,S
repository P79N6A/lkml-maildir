Thanks.  You mention that one of the patches, Benchmark, reduced
time spent in user space.  I guess that means that patch hurt
something ... though I'm confused ... wouldn't these patches risk
spending more time in system space, not less in user space?
Do you have any analysis of the other runs?  Just looking at raw
numbers, when it's not a benchmark I've used recently, kinda fuzzes
over my feeble brain.
