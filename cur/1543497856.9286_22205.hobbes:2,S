Hi Jeff, All,
Flow control exists on both ends of a TCP connection because the local
network at either end can get congested independently of the other.  I
haven't noticed this problem (I'm running 2.2.9 and 2.3.5+devfs) on my
boxen, but I'm connected via ethernet and there are slower links upstream.
Perhaps there are retransmission timing issues with slower links?
