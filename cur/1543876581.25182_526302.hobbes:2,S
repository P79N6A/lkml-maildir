There could be an ioproc_update_range() call in
memory.c:copy_pte_range(), after the pte_unmap_unlock(), and this
would be an optimisation, since explicitly updating the mappings in
the Quadrics RDMA NIC avoids the need for the NIC to trap and update
it's MMU later.
The code which implements [1] this takes the pagetable locks with
pte_offset_map_lock(), and uses one of the kmap_atomic slots, so has
to be after the pagetables are unlocked. The
ioproc_invalidate_page/range() calls are different and can't live with
this race, so have to be used with the pagetable locks held.
