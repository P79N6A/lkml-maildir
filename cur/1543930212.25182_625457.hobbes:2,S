Ok, but the problem seems to have appeared before 2.6.24-rc4.

Server is 2.6.23-rc9 and is exporting:
/dirA/dirB
10.10.20.0/255.255.255.0(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,insecure,crossmnt)
/dirA/dirB/dirC
10.10.20.0/255.255.255.0(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,insecure)
/dirA/dirB/dirD
10.10.20.0/255.255.255.0(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,insecure)
The NFS client (Core2 SMP) 2.6.24-rc3-git4:
NFS-server:/dirA/dirB     /dirA/dirB    nfs
auto,rsize=16384,wsize=16384,hard,intr,users,exec,nfsvers=3,tcp,nolock,actimeo=0
Then on the client when the new kernel has booted:
ls /dirA/dirB      --> normal listing
ls /dirA/dirB/dirC   -->  Stale NFS file handle
ls /dirA/dirB/dirD   -->  Stale NFS file handle
I will do a few more builds/boots and check -rc3-git2 and -rc3-git3.
Will report back shortly,
Shane
