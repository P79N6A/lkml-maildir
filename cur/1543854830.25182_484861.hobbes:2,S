Ok, to solve the problem in the way which should be good for both I
decided to implement additional syscall which will allow to mark any
event as ready and thus wake up appropriate threads. If userspace will
request zero events to be marked as ready, syscall will just
interrupt/wakeup one of the listeners parked in syscall.
