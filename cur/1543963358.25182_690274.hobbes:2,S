A stripped-down program exposing the leak is attached. It doesn't fork
or do any other fancy stuff, so I don't see a way it could leave any fd
open.
While trying to reproduce this, I noticed that the huge page wouldn't
leak when I just mmapped it and exited without explicitly unmapping, as
I described before. The huge page is leaked only when the
/proc/self/pagemap entry for the huge page is read. The kernel I tested
with was 2.6.26-rc1-00179-g3de2403.

Yes, but the pages remain lost.
