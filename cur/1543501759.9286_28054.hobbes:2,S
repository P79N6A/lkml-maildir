Hi,
I am have been unable to get a loop device to work over NFS. My situation
is a machine with no local storage that boots over ethernet and NFS mounts
all of it's file systems. From there I tried to losetup /dev/loop0 using a
backing file from the NFS mount. Everything works fine except the
resulting file contains 8 meg of 0's. I am using kernel 2.2.10 with no
patches.
The NFS server is the user land NFS server with version '2.2beta37'.
Thanks,
Jason
