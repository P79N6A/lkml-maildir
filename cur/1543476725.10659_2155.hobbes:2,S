We're doing such a complete rewrite with Perl right now.  It's a
big project, even though the fine points of Perl aren't nearly as
razor-sharp as the fine points of Linux.
That said, I think that right about Linux 3.0 or so it'd be an
interesting project to take the core of Linux and a few device
drivers, and see what the rewrite would look like.  There would be no
mandatory efficiency loss, and C++'s additional expressiveness....
