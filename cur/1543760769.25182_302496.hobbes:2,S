I've just ran that on my Cyrix MII PR300 and the bug is present:
old_ss=0x7b new_ss=0x7f
In sighandler: esp=bffff780
old_esp=0xbffff780 new_esp=0xc1a6f780
BUG!
I have also an older Cyrix CPU - 6x86 PR166 - but can't test it now as 
it's sitting in a plastic box on the shelf :-)
UMC U5SX/33 in my router - also present:
old_ss=0x7b new_ss=0x7f
In sighandler: esp=bffff820
old_esp=0xbffff820 new_esp=0xc003f820
BUG!
