Well it would be a shutdown method not a suspend method.  The authors of
the suspend code thought sharing code with the reboot and the rmmod case
didn't make sense.
For a normal kexec into another kernel I think this makes sense.

For the kexec on panic not shutting the hardware down if at all possible is
the ideal.  There I think we need a mode to not touch a chunk of the iommu
and reserve it for the kexec on panic kernel (or perhaps just use the
swiotlb code if we need bounce buffers at all).
