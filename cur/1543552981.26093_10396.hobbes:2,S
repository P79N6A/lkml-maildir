hmm, as initrd now is used by almost evry Linux distributor, there for
sure will be a fix sooner or later if it is broken ;-)
... just wait a bit or complain on linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

original message ...
Any chance to fix the following bug in 2.4.x
dmesg (from bootup message) ...
change_root: old root has d_count=3
freeram /dev/ram0
File freeram.c: Line 41: ioctl /dev/ram0: Error 16: Device or resource busy
I cannot free the old initrd root partition under 2.4.0-testx, but it works
fine on 2.2.17. I used loadlin to boot up
ramdisk initrd first, load the ide driver, and boot up the real linux.
I hope you guys are still the one maintaining initrd, if not, please point
me to someone who can help,
or send me a few lines as to how I can fix this.
Thanks,
Jeff
