Etc.  I think you're just being silly here, and know it.

Correct.  But the C standard says that it has certain properties (and
implies some others).  Basically, if I write a program and get reports
that it dies with a SIGBUS in some circumstances, I go on a bug-hunt
for the use of misaligned addresses and such.  I would be very unhappy
to discover that I've been looking at a memory shortage masquerading
as a program bug.  (I do test the return of malloc.)  If the signal
sent had been (say) SIGNOMEM instead then I'd at least be spared that
particular incovenience.

If you want to write even moderately portable code, then you haven't
got many options besides trusting malloc.  More sophisticated methods
of obtaining memory tend to differ between systems, and even between
different revisions of a system.  Writing your own memory management
routines will (in portable code) typically be done _on top of_ malloc
rather than in stead of it.
Properly coping with memory that may not be there when it is used
requires special programming techniques.  I'm not unwilling to use
such techniques, when appropriate, but not in all cases.

An overcommitting MM system _can be_ more advanced.  It can also
overcommit because it cannot figure out how not do so.  As far as I
can tell linux currently falls in the latter category: it cannot
tell to what extent memory has been overcommitted, nor does it allow
for selective overcommitment.
