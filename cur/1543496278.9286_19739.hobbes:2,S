I did a new 2.2.9_andrea1.bz2 just for you. I would be glad if you would
try to benchmark it and compare it with the stock 2.2.9 kernel for
web-serving or everything else purposes (mainly in SMP). There's all my
new VM/buffers/SMP-scheduler/simple-wake-one/etc..etc.. stuff included
(NOTE: the unlock_kernel-during-memcpy thing suggested by Andi in an email
of this thread is _not_ included in my patch, so you may want to add it by
hand in a _secondary_ benchmark stage).
If you'll run a benchmark also over 2.3.x you may give a try also to
2.3.3_andrea2.bz2 (that is the equivalent of 2.2.9_andrea1 but against
the unstable branch).
To compile it just apply it and run `make oldconfig'. Say N for the kernel
lock profiling (to not lose one bit of performances in getting a bit more
of info). Then make dep clean and go ahead.
Thanks :-).

PS. Don't forget to make sure that apache is sleeping in accept(2) and
_not_ in flock(2), just run strace -p `pid of one apache child` to know
where it's sleeping. If it's sleeping in flock(2) you must recompile it
with the option to sleep in accept.
