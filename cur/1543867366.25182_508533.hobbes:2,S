Ok, I had little to time review the code, but it has been a long 
working day, so bear with me if I missed something.
I don't see how sys_async_exec would not block, based on your patches. 
Let's try to follow:
- We enter sys_async_exec
- We may fill the pool, but that's nothing interesting ATM. A bunch of 
  threads will be created, and they'll end up sleeping inside the 
  cachemiss_loop
- We set the async_ready pointer and we fall inside exec_atom
- There we copy the atom (nothing interesting from a scheduling POV) and 
  we fall inside __exec_atom
- In __exec_atom we do the actual syscall call. Note that we're still the 
  task/thread that called sys_async_exec
- So we enter the syscall, and now we end up in schedule because we're 
  just unlucky
- We notice that the async_ready pointer is not NULL, and we call 
  __async_schedule
- Finally we're in pick_new_async_thread and we pick one of the ready 
  threads sleeping in cachemiss_loop
- We copy the pt_regs to the newly picked-up thread, we set its async head 
  pointer, we set the current task async_ready pointer to NULL, we 
  re-initialize the async_thread structure (the old async_ready), and we 
  put ourselves in the busy_list
- Then we roll back to the schedule that started everything, and being 
  still "prev" for the scheduler, we go to sleep
So the sys_async_exec task is going to block. Now, am I being really 
tired, or the cachemiss fast return is simply not there?
There's another problem AFAICS:
- We woke up one of the cachemiss_loop threads in pick_new_async_thread
- The threads wakes up, mark itself as busy, and look at the ->work 
  pointer hoping to find something to work on
But we never set that pointer to a userspace atom AFAICS. Me blind? :)
