This was due a serious bug in gnu make; see

This effects most of the recent make releases, and is _not_
sun/sparc/solaris specific, so don't stop reading the bug report at
the first line ;)
I've posted a patch against make-3.81 which fixes it for me.
Symptoms: Random crashing of make worker sub-processes at high -j#.
More pronounced when threads are waiting on i/o (make enables SIGCHLD
interrupts for short periods which can interrupt read(2) in the worker
threads and EINTR isn't handled)
This will likely effect anyone using large -j# on larger
multi-core/multi-processor machines, so BEWARE!
