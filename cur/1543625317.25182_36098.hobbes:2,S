I believe it's CONFIG_HIGHMEM you're thinking of there: dma_addr_t
and struct page do depend on CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM/CONFIG_HIGHMEM in recent
kernels, but not on CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G/CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G(CONFIG_X86_PAE).
I don't know why it's CONFIG_HIGHMEM rather than CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G
that decides the u64-ness dma_addr_t.  There is a dmaaddr_high_t
which behaves more expectedly, but it's not so widely used.
