Subject: x86_64 compile spewing hundreds of warnings - started 2.6.15-git8

between 2.6.15-git7 and 2.6.15-git8 we started getting hundreds of 
compile warnings:
-git7: 
http://test.kernel.org/20295/debug/test.log.0
-git8: 
http://test.kernel.org/20402/debug/test.log.0
Warnings look like this:
include/asm/bitops.h: In function `load_elf32_binary':
include/asm/bitops.h:30: warning: read-write constraint does not allow a 
register
include/asm/bitops.h:30: warning: read-write constraint does not allow a 
register

register

What do these mean? And how do we get rid of it?
Presumably caused by this:
