Agreed, this would make a _lot_ of difference in the time it
takes to get a new stable kernel really stable.

Doesn't mean we need to get _all_ our TODO items done in
2.5.  I really don't see what's wrong with doing only a
few in 2.5 and delaying the rest for 2.7, especially not
when both 2.5 and 2.7 happen quickly ;)
