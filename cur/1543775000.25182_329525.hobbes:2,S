Actually, I was guilty of posting email to LKML before being fully
awake...  How about the following instead?
	void set_nmi_callback(nmi_callback_t callback)
	{
		rcu_assign_pointer(nmi_callback, callback);
	}
Similarly:
	void unset_nmi_callback(void)
	{
		rcu_assign_pointer(nmi_callback, dummy_nmi_callback);
	}
This, combined with the rcu_dereference() in do_nmi() seem to me to
make the usage a lot more clear.  If you agree, would you like to
submit the patches, or should I?

Glad they help, will clean them up (so that the examples use
rcu_dereference() and rcu_assign_pointer()) and submit them!
							Thanx, Paul
