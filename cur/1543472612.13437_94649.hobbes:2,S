Why should we change GPL? There' s no one good reason as far I can see.
And note that the GPL explicit say:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think that if there are no problems or concerns about free software
there's no one good reason to change it. 
It' s obvious also that a dream for IBM would be that every GPL code
developer out there will accomplish to drop his copyright holder, to get
all the GPL'd code out there and then release it as proprietary software
binary only.  That would mean great software at zero price. If something
of similar going to happens?
I would like to know if people that contributed to GPL code is going to be
exploited these days. 
Personally the main reasons I like free software is that is the only thing
I know that make justice since it make no difference between a guy with
three master degree and me ;), and so it allows me to play with code that
would be otherwise forbidden to my eyes in a proprietary envinroment so I
can learn tons of interesting things, and I like that everybody out there
can do the same I am doing now and I'll do my best in my spare time to
contribute it. I don' t care money at all (as far I can eat every day ;),
I care to learn and to do something of fun!
