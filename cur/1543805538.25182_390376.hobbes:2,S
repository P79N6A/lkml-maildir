But from the Joe SixPack user standpoint, he should be able to click to 
launch the program, and click on the file he wants to put on the cd.  
The leds on the face of the drive should come on and the cd should come 
out.
All he knows is its that thing with the coffee holder sticking out of 
the front of the box that he had to remove his beer from to put in the 
blank cd & he doesn't care, *as long as it works*.
You have been offered a way to simplify your interface by many many 
lines of code, yet you resist, insisting that all other platforms do it 
your way, when in fact they don't either according to several lengthy 
threads I've now read on this subject.  There are far more winderz 
users than linux so far, and the winderz interface, except for the 
actual names used (drive F, what a strange moniker that is) is no more 
nor less complex, and both _just work_ if properly used.  A simple 
case: statement should handle it all.  So whats the problem?

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
