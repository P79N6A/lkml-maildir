So, for ARM, we end up with the following gcc versions which appear to
work:
	- gcc 2.95.3 + patch
	- gcc 2.95.4
	- gcc 3.2.2 + patch
	- gcc 3.2.3 + patch
	- gcc 3.3
(Some of the gcc people may beg to differ, but the above list results
from many reports and real life experiences from several people.)
From what I understand, the gcc people are not all that happy about
the gcc 3.2.x patch, based upon the fact that it has not been applied.
It is also possible that gcc 3.3 happens to work because the bug got
hidden by other changes, or, the real bug did get fixed.  No one seems
to know.  Certainly the bugzilla entry remains open and unresolved.
