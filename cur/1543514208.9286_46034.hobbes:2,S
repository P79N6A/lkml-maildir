Could people observing such syslog messages please check whether they
have loaded an ISDN hardware level driver after the isdn network interface
had already been created?
Rationale:
There is one potential problem with isdn net_device's dev->hard_header_len.
dev->hard_header_len is set in isdn_net_init, which is called when a new isdn
net interface is registered. In order to set dev->hard_header_len, it
needs to know about the hard header space the hardware level isdn driver
needs. However, if a hardware level drivers with larger header space
requirements were loaded after the net device was already registered, this
might result in a dev->hard_header_len insufficient for use with the
new isdn HL driver.
Another question:
What other options affecting link headers are in effect? For isdn protocol
headers, you can do a `isdnctrl list ...'. For ppp headers, what options
(in particular compression related) are enabled for ipppd? What options
are in effect after the ppp connection is up (should be visible from
ipppd's debug log)
