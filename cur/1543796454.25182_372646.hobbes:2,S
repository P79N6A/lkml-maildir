     But does it make sense to use it in any other circumstances? It sounds
like the rb-tree based ktimer system is suitable for the general case. So
you can have a simple rule: use ktimeout for timing out when an expected
event doesn't occur, and ktimer for everything else. Are there any
situations where you want a timer optimized for the removal case that is not
also monotonic and low-res? And are there any situations in practice other
than the "timeout" one where you'd want to use a timer wheel instead of a
rb-tree?
    It sounds to me that the ktimer should be the general case, leaving
ktimeout to be optimized for one particular case (by e.g. decreasing the
resolution to reduce cascades).
