Close.  The problem is that we could have slept with the
count elevated on start before we do rcu_read_lock().

Agreed.  Since we are guaranteed that ->next will still
be valid we should be able to get this down to a single
pid_alive check.  Although I'm not certain I would want
to return a task that had just died from either of these functions.
But I guess the race is there regardless.

Probably my general paranoia.  I know I didn't quite grok
rcu at the time I wrote that code, and I could have easily
gotten confused about what task_lock protects.  Looks like
I need to generate a patch to cleanup that one.
