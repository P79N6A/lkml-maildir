   That's what I was saying - that I can't tell what it really is because
their driver is binary only. (just after where you clipped the quote) 
However, regardless where the bugs are, there is a situation where interrupts
are being lost with my pcmcia card.  It might be related, it might not.  I
assume it is in the lucent driver since it only occurs with this driver loaded
(and this driver seems to take over my sound card as well - it doesn't seem
to be the best example of a Linux driver).  I don't see any email address in
the binary (with a quick scan through it) or in any of the readme or other
files that came with it, and I was told by someone at another company that
this module was probably leaked and not supposed to have been released yet
(he was helping to beta test).
   Am I correct in assuming that if the Lucent driver were to obtain a lock
and/or hold the cpu for long enough that it could cause an interrupt to be
dropped in the fashion that is occuring now?
