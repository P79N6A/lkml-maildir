I know about this, which is what started me looking at what x86 does,
and I am firmly of the conclusion that x86 is buggy as it stands.
I believe that we can, instead of having a per-machine fix on ARM, have
a generic fix.  At the moment, I haven't worked out exactly what this
generic fix would be.

My concern with the x86 fix is what if 9.9999999999ms has passed since the
last timer tick, and we got the timer tick after we disabled interrupts and
entered do_gettimeofday.  This can lead to the tests in there miscorrecting
IMHO.  You won't see it with an infinite loop reading the time of day...
I'll re-read your mail in more depth later tonight.  Appologies if this
reply appears to be a little early.
