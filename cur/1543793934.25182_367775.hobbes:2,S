Using the information from this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112593256400003&r=1&w=2
I've now compiled a kernel with the intelfb and fbcon drivers linked in 
(no other fb drivers). By booting the kernel with vga=0x318 I get a 
1024x768@16bpp console and drm/agp also seems happy.
However, as soon as X starts, the following message is printed to the 
kernel log:
mtrr: base(0xe0020000) is not aligned on a size(0x300000) boundary
[drm:drm_unlock] *ERROR* Process 3013 using kernel context 0
Everything seems to work in X though. The first time that I switch 
from X to a vc, the screen stays black for a few seconds before I get 
the VC and then I get this:
intelfb: Changing the video mode is not supported.
intelfb: ring buffer : space: 61488 wanted 65472
intelfb: lockup - turning off hardware acceleration
I have X set to also use 1024x768@16bpp, what else do I need to do to 
make sure that intelfb and X play nice together?
