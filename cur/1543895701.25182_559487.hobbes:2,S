Looks correct to me. Although...

I don't think it's appropriate to include chip-specific options here.
This option will not affect the driver at all, it will only affect the
board-specific setup code, so IMO it should be under Platform-specific
options or something like that.
Also, the text says AT91/AT32 but it depends on one particular AT91
chip.
I haven't had a chance to test it since I don't have any STN displays
around, but I'll try forwarding it to someone who has.
