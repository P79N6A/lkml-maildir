Yep, brought a chuckle to me as well.

To be fair, he did say Linux was a stepping board. So once one of
these NGOS's is ready for general use (and doesn't run like a
one-legged dog in a swamp), he will switch to it. Frankly, I don't see
that happening in the timeframe he mentions. Sure, there will be a
public release of such an NGOS, but I suspect it will run slower than
Linux 2.0. Maybe slower than Linux 1.2.
I recall a quote from Dave Miller a year or two ago, when there was a
thread about monolithic vs. microkernels. He pointed out that we
haven't even come to the limits of monolithic kernel design, so
considering monolithic kernels like Linux as "obsolete" is highly
premature.
Much later, with 2.2 on the doorstep, I pause and consider his
words. 2.2 has brought us many performance improvements (networking,
dcache, SMP). It's a great day indeed for those who religiously stick
to "production" kernels. So, what now? Will kernel development slow to
a crawl (disregarding driver development)? No way! I see talk of
future developments (for 2.3) in many areas of the kernel. If
anything, activity is even more vigorous that it was back when 2.0 was
released. That may reflect the increased number of developers that
have been attracted to Linux.
So: you ain't seen nothing yet!
