No.  I don't see any ongoing logging from apm.  Looking at dmesg I see
boot stuff about battery minutes having swapped bytes, some version
and flag printk's, but no current logging.
In /var/spool/messages I also see mention of the times I have
suspended and awakened my laptop, but no other ongoing loggin there
either.
