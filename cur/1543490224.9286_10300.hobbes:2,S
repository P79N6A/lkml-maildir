thanks. 2.2.3-ac2 fixes it.
as for the other problem ...
it would appear to be the cd thats at fault. it is a 
Philips CDD3600 SCSI cd-rewriter. are there known problems with
this make? is the problem fixable or will i just have to put up
with it?
the problems are totally reproducable. if more info is needed, let
me know.
thanks again for the help.
keith.
