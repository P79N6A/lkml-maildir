What does current mean? 2nd (and this is not a problem w/ u, but rather me) I 
know nada about Slackware, and the people I know who know about Slackware 
don't read LKML)

Kindly, RTFM. Maintainers are listed in <kernel src>/MAINTAINERS
Also, this is not to mean that the q shouldn't be on lkml

   They were big and little creatures. Some were hairy with long, thin
   tails, and some had noses long as pokers. Some had bulging eyes and
   some had 20 toes. In they came -- crashing through the door, sliding
   down the chimney, crawling through the windows. They shouted and
   cried. They banged pots and pans. They twirled their tails and tapped
   their toes upon the wooden floor. He watched as the trolls gobbled the
   food and threw the plates and drank everything in sight. They
   continued to shout and scream, to scratch the walls and pound the
   floors and slap their tails upon the table. The tiny trolls were the
   worst of all. They screamed at the top of their lungs and pulled each
   others' tails.
