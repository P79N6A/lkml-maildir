Do it like CONFIG_FAT_FS/CONFIG_MSDOS_FS/CONFIG_VFAT_FS...
config SMB_COMMON
    tristate
config CIFS
    select SMB_COMMON
config SMB2
    select SMB_COMMON

Could not they have named it CIFS2... :p
And, what also puzzles me... almost every filesystem that's not at revision 1
anymore (ext2/3/4, reiser4, smb2) does not have the usually omnipresent "fs"
suffix anymore (cf. reiserfs, smbfs). Maybe it's time to drop all the "fs"
suffixes? :)
