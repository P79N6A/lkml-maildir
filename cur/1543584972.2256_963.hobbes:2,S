But wouldn't falling back to dummycon prevent the driver specific
suspend/resume calls from working?  Or at a minimum, make handling those
calls more complex?
No, there does not need to be graphical images of the text console -- a
simply text buffer would suffice.  But what about things like GTKFb and
Embedded QT?  They would certainly benefit from having a backup screen
image, right?  I do not believe there is any way to determine if the
console is in fact in a 'text' or graphical state.
