Looking at the strace, it would _seem_ that an SG_IO failure could very
well be the reason for the diverged paths. And that would indicate
another bug in that area, outside of what we already fixed for
2.6.20-rc1.
Is the hddtemp source not available?

If you can just test 2.6.19-git1, then we'll know if it's the SG_IO
patch again.
