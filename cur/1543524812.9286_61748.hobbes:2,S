I posted a similar message a month or so ago but was ignored :-( I've been
getting the same problem but have not yet found a way to replicate it. In
fact your crash dump is almost identical to mine. It seems to happen most
often after I run LILO to re-read lilo.conf although it has happened under
other circumstances too. Currently the way I have been solving it on my
RH6.1 systems is to run the RH6.1 upgrade. It doesn't actually upgrade
anything (since the system is already RH6.1) but it does make the system
bootable again.
If I had to speculate, I would agree that it is an IDE issue because it
only seems to happen after I have been diddling with the sensitive areas
of the disk (boot record).
I am not a kernel hacker either, but it seems like this is a real problem.
Is there anyone who can look into this?
