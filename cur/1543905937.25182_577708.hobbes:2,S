Some of your users are developers, too :-). Should I generate a patch?

Hmm, ok, it is not as simple as I thought. include/linux/netpoll.h
already includes mechanism to notify interested parties really soon,
but drivers still call dev_alloc_skb() before that.

Hmm, adding GFP_GIVE_ME_EMERGENCY_POOLS to dev_alloc_skb(), then doing
...
int netif_rx(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct softnet_data *queue;
	unsigned long flags;
	/* if netpoll wants it, pretend we never saw it */
	if (netpoll_rx(skb))
		return NET_RX_DROP;
	if (memory_is_still_very_low())
		return NET_RX_DROP;
...should do the trick. Would something like that be acceptable to
network people?
