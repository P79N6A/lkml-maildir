It seems that the "C++ in kernel" thread is degenerating into 
nothing other than a "I'm right, you are wrong" spat. Until some 
is able to materialise a source tree that uses those C++ features 
the C++ camp desires to see implimented, the idea remains in the 
realms of fantasy. (Isn't the Linux mantra, "Just do it" ?)
Would one of the C++ advocates with the neccessary resources please 
create a mailing list for expressly for a 'C++ kernel' discusson, if
this has not been done already ? The current thread does nothing to
enhance the image of Linux in the public eye and the more it degenerates,
the more counter productive will becomes. (Which is to the advantage of
several commerial entities). 
Those not interested in C++ should really be ignore the whole subject
altogether. Unless our benevolent high priest(s?) has decided other
wise, C++ in the mainstream kernel is not an issue.
