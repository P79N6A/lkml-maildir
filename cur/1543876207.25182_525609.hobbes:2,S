Correct. I seem to remember that the latter is considered 
"deprecated, but some programs may still depend on it".  So I disabled it to 
see what broke.  udev complained about the missing /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug,
but was happy to use /sys/kernel/uevent_helper instead.  I didn't
notice other problems, so I left things like that.
