I am trying to install a linksys WPC11 pcmcia card on my sony
vaio. I have enabled the Hermes driver in the kernel (using
2.4.20). I have also built the linux-wlan package. When I
insert the card, I get the following:
prism2_cs.o: 0.1.16-pre7 loaded
init_module: dev_info is prism2_cs
prism2_cs: RequestIRQ: Resource in use
prism2sta_config: NextTuple failure? It's probably a Vcc mismatch
prism2sta_event: prism2_cs: initalization failed!
Any help would be appreciated.
I had to unsubscribe from the list while I'm on vacation, so
please reply back to me.
