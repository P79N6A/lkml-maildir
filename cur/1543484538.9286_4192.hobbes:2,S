There's security problem.
^O is recognized as kind-of end-of-line by bash. (Try typing ls / ^O
in shell).
So if I echo \033? | write root (and he's in shell), I make him
execute (K)0% command. There are numerous ways how to get escape
sequence to console of your victim. (Write, filename, processname,
...)
BEWARE!
