This  has   been  discussed  along   with  the  HAL  people   a  while
ago. Actually, file systems can  introduce a refcount, where we need a
decrement function  which automatically unmounts the  filesystem if we
decrement the use count to zero. Kind of an automatic umount.
How  do  you tell  which  file  systems  shall be  autoumounted?   HAL
suggestion: introduce a no-op mount  option. For some classes of fs'es
we might as well make that obligatory, such as tar.
