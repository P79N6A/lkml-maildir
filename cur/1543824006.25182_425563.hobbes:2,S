Yes, but the question is:
	What's the trick to get the module into the kernel?
It seems that we are currently under the mercy of the few, who have the power 
to control this.  And forking isn't really a solution.
With a stable API, I can just implement whatever w/o caring whether it is 
included into the kernel.  Now that's freedom!
Thanks!
