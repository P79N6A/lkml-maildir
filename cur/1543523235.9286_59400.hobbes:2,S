I'll agree with You saying that mostly all apps have a worse performances 
if multithreaded, if You agree with me that there are cases that can have a
boost from it ( in SMP ).

I've never said that I want to change the scheduler, I've submitted a patch
for discussion.
And I've seen that there are a lot of guys for whom touching the scheduler
is like touch their girlfriend ;)

Sure I'll do bechmarks even if we've confused scheduler changes for application
design.
Just now I'm testing ( benchmarking ) the new version of the scheduler that use
clusterization under high ( tunable ) loads while use the linear scan for low
workloads.
AFAIS it has the performance boost of the cluster-scheduler at high workloads
as long has the same times of the linear-scheduler under low ones.
OK to stop this thread.
PS:
I've never put under discussion Your and other guys knowledge and preparation.
I know perfectly who You are as long as other famous guys writing in this list.
Davide.
