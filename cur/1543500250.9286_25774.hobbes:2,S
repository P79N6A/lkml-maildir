kernels 2.2-pre1 or higher have a display problem with IBM Extended ASCII
line-drawing characters ( codepage 437 ).
This bug may be most easily seen in the nethack game in tty mode with the 
IBMgraphic option, which displays fine on all kernels before 2.2.X
This bug showed up when the "console drivers" option was added to the kernel
config. I have of course tried turning off all console drivers options, but
then I have no display.
The following is the output from the linux/scripts/ver_linux script :
Kernel modules         2.1.121
Gnu C                  2.7.2.3
Binutils               2.9.1.0.19
Linux C Library        5.4.46
Dynamic linker         ldd: version 1.9.9
Linux C++ Library      2.9.0
Procps                 2.0.2
Mount                  2.9i
Net-tools              1.52
Kbd                    0.94
Sh-utils               1.16
Modules Loaded         lp parport_pc parport
I would like to reiterate that booting the same system with a 2.1.99 kernel 
solves all display problems.
