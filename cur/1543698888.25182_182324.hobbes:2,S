I did get msgs twice here in the past few hours, 
but only sometimes does it give anything.  Here's 
what it said: 
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address: 00000000
 printing eip:
c02363dd
*pde=00000000
Oops: 0000
CPU: 0
EIP: 0010:[<c02363d>]  Not tainted
EFLAGS: 00010217
eax: 00000006   ebx: 00000000  ecx: 7a01a8c0   ecx: c700b2a0
esi: c0299ce0   edi: 000001b7  ebp: c0299d94   esp: c0299c54
ds: 0018  es: 0018  ss: 0018
process: swapper (pid: 0, stackpage = c0299000)
Other than that, nothing.  Is there a patch out there 
that will simply make 2.4.22 secure?  Things run great
on that kernel.
