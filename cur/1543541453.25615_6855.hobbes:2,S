Hello,
The following patch make the system preemptable; a task
(kernel or user) can be scheduled while running in the
kernel space if this is safe to do so.
The results are quite interesting.
The patch is against 2.2.16 and is for UP only on intel platforms.
PS: The patch also includes some modif regarding the VM/kswapd.
Sorry I was too lazy to make a clean diff, but it shouldn't bother
too much for the experiment.
Ludo.
