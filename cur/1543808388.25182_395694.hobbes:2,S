This I did not know.  I'm not sure if it will really matter or not.  The
initramfs is already gzip -9'd.  I have a list of modules that are required
for stage 1 which pulls in the dependancies for those modules.  It does
currently fit on a single floppy.  I'm using a upx compressed kernel, a gzip
-9'd initramfs, kernel is compiled with -Os and I'm using a -Os compiled
busybox statically compiled with uclibc.  When it's all said and done, I
have less than 10kb available on a floppy.  I thought it was quite an
acomplishment getting all that one 1 floppy.
