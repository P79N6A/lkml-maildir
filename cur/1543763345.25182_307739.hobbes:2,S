I think they can.  
BTW:
My work on this has been mostly in the context of a 2.6 kernel based 
generalization of a softIRQ as thread patch for 2.4 that enables priority 
tuning of the bottom half processing as well as /proc support for turning on 
and off the feature.   We got it to work.
However; I don't know what good workloads and metrics to measure the goodness 
of the work look like.  If folks think priority tuning of bottom half 
processing is worth persuing and can help me quantify its effectiveness 
better than running a jitter test while doing a BONNIE test run on a SCSI 
JBOD, then I'm happy to do more with this.
