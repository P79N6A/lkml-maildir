REMOVE YOU FROM WHAT, MORON!?
I'm ignoring further mails from you. Why the fuck would it be my
responsibility to remove you from a list you subscribed yourself to?
Get your priorities straight. Perhaps start out by checking exactly
which list you are on. I'll give you some help (even though you
definitely don't deserve any), it's obviously one of these two:
laforge@netfilter.org
or
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
Sheeesh, the nerve of some people.
