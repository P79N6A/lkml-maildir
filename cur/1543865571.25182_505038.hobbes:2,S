Just did a search about this message around the kernel source tree.
The interesting thing is that I see the following comments at several
different arch/drivers files. Is it related to your problem?
 *  Known BIOS problems we have to work around:
 *      - I/O or memory regions not configured
 *      - regions configured, but not enabled in the command register
 *      - bogus I/O addresses above 64K used
  *      - expansion ROMs left enabled (this may sound harmless, but given
  *        the fact the PCI specs explicitly allow address decoders to be
  *        shared between expansion ROMs and other resource regions, it's
 *        at least dangerous)
