Well, right now most of the work is on getting 2.3 stable, i hope.
2.3 won't be THE experimental release forever (and shouldn't be right now,
BTW). Read your last sentence again, and it's what i'm really proposing.
Call 2.3 'the stable one' and 2.5 'the experimental release' and you get
what i'm asking for. Probably it can't be done in a day, since 2.3
is not ready today to be called 'the stable release'. But i think that's
the way to go.

As you wrote, they're already 'on the other branch'. Just ban all non
working features from 2.3, and go for stability only. In a short time
we can have a quite stable 2.4pre (without many wanted but still new
features). At that time start 2.5 and be ready to put all the new code
in it. In six months (remember, numbers here are just placeholders) we can
have a 2.6 (or 3.0 whatever) with the new features. I'm more willing
to wait 6 months for a 2.6+everything and have 2.4 quite soon than to
wait 4 months for 2.4+everything. Of course that's my personal taste.
Still it sounds good to me to stop adding new features to 2.3 now and
add them to a baby named 2.5.

"Wild" development will go on on ONE branch only, of course. Getting
2.3 stable enough to call it 2.4 is not exactly "wild development"...
I'm not an expert, but i can see there are some difficulties in porting
from 2.2 to 2.3. I'm not speaking of generic drivers, but of some of the
JFS code (Ext3 and ReiserFS).
