As a matter of fact I already have such a kernel compiled but I need to be
there in person to make sure it doesn't blow up. :)
There were four files:
linux-2.2.16-aacraid-1.0.3.patch
linux-2.2.16-aacraid-1.0.3-paths.patch
linux-2.2.16-aacraid-1.0.4.patch
linux-2.2.16-aacraid-1.0.5.patch
The only part of the patchs that caused a reject with 2.2.17 was this:
--- linux/drivers/scsi/scsi.c.aacraid   Tue Jun 13 12:52:09 2000
+++ linux/drivers/scsi/scsi.c   Tue Jun 13 12:52:42 2000

Easily addable by hand.  
Though I am concerned about the KNOWNBUGS file that was in the 1.0.3 patch
but was removed by the later version patches.  It seems to indicate its a
bad idea to compile it directly in the kernel.  Is it better to compile it
as a module?
Thanks for your time...
