Doesn't this increment it if the call succeeds? In open_for_data, ret is the
return code from the open call, which should be zero upon success. Problem is,
we already incremented it when we entered cdrom_open.

Yeah, my patch is just a hack :)  Not really for general use i think, but it
allows me to open the door using the button. The cdrom.c from test11-mm1 never
incremented use_count until after the success of one of the preceeding calls. I
was just undoing the original increment that now happens upon entering
cdrom_open. The use_count does control the door lock though. If you look under
cdrom_release, the door unlock code never gets executed until use_count=0. I
haven't checked overall operation of my cdrom drives enough to know what else is
wrong.
