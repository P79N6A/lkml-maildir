No, the scheduler gives a bonus to tasks with the same MM context
(i.e. threads) being scheduled on the same CPU. IOW when deciding
which task to schedule, one with the same MM context is given a small
bonus. Last time I looked, the bonus was 3 timer ticks (== 3 dynamic
priority levels).
But it's merely a bonus (designed to improve cache affinity). It
doesn't mean threads are locked to the same CPU.
