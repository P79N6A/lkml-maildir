Quite apart from the sync() matter, _any_ synchronous call to a FUSE 
filesystem during STR will cause trouble.  Even if the user task 
implementing the filesystem isn't frozen, when it tries to carry out 
some I/O to a suspended device it will either:
	block until the system wakes up, or
	cause the suspend to abort.
Neither outcome is desirable.
