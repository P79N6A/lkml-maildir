The smp_alt mutex taken in
alternatives_smp_module_add/alternatives_smp_module_del seems required
because this code will run at module load/free, even in SMP context (not
within stop_machine_run).
As for alternatives_smp_switch, which is called when switching between
UP and SMP, always in UP context, I guess we should assume it could be
executed concurrently wrt the module_load/free, even in UP on a
CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel.
