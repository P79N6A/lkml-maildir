something like this: ?

Subject: [PATCH] resource: Don't warn for driver originated resource structures
Some drivers (vesafb) only map/reserve a portion of a resource.
If then some other driver comes in and maps the whole resource,
the current code WARN_ON's. This is not the intent of the checks
in iomem_map_sanity_check(); rather these checks want to
warn when crossing *hardware* resources only.
This patch skips BUSY resources as suggested by Linus.
Note: having two drivers talk to the same hardware at the same
time is obviously not optimal behavior, but that's a separate story.
