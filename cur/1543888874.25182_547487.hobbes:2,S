I'm not proposing the KGI solution where every device driver presents
the same API. That model does require a lot of code in the kernel.
The existing DRM model where each driver provides it's own API is a
good one. The user space DRI driver then takes this API and turns it
into a standard one. Applying the DRM style model to fbdev may allow
parts of fbdev to be moved out to user space.
What I don't want is a permanent root priv process hanging around in
the system. It simply isn't needed and I have prototyped a system that
runs without root so I know it can be done. With minor mods DRI can
run without the need for root, with more major mods the X server can
run without the need for root. Most of the mods to the X server are to
remove things like PCI bus probing, mode setting and VBIOS support.
