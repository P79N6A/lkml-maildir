I must be misunderstanding something.  If the point of the patch is to
shrink "struct rcu_head" (which it seems to do) won't that change
offsets in all sorts of things like "struct dentry"?  I know we
officially don't care about binary modules but a change like that
seems pretty gratuitous for such a small gain.
This sounds like the kind of change that should either happen now or
wait for 2.7.1 (and not be backported into 2.6)
