But that's different.
We're limping along in a semi-OK fashion with the TSC.  But now Thomas is
proposing that we effectively kill it off for all x86 because of hrtimers.
And afaict the reason for that is that we're using jiffies to determine if
the TSC has gone bad, and that test is getting false positives.

That'll hurt the big machines rather a lot, won't it?
