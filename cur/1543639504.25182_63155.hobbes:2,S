Hrrmm...  That definitely sounds like partition-parser getting
screwed in the middle of IO - it _does_ read the first sector
and apparently hangs in attempt to read another one.  Very
interesting, since AFAICS all changes that could have affected
that place happened between .28 and .29.
Deadlocks in surrounding code are very unlikely, since it simply
doesn't care about block number and would just as happily hang
while reading the first sector.  Which it hadn't.
Could you give the output of fdisk -lu /dev/hde? (after booting a working
kernel, obviously ;-)
