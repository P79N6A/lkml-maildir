Of course it doesn't. You're right it could be just because of I/O
bandwith shortage. But it could really be also because of vm write
throttling.
xmms can end waiting I/O completion for I/O submitted by other I/O bound
tasks. This because xmms is reading from disk and in turn it is
allocating cache and in turn it is allocating memory. While allocating
memory it may need to write throttle.
Copying the file to /dev/shm fixed the problem but that would cover both
the write throttling and the disk bandwith problems at the same time and
I guess it's a mixed effect of both things.

I didn't checked the patch in the detail yet but it seems you covered
read/write some bits in /proc and a lru list during buffer flushing. I
agree that it should be enough to give the same effects of the preempt
patch.

Exactly.

I don't renice my X server (I rather renice all cpu hogs to +19 and I
left -20 for something that really needs to run as fast as possible
regardless of the X server).
