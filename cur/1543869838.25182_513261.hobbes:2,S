Subject: Hang when shutting down - seems umount and NFS related - kernel version 2.6.18.1

I have a server that has the sole job of serving up a bunch of NFS
filesystems to webservers. The server is running kernel 2.6.18.1
A few days ago when attempting to reboot the server, the shutdown
process hung with a backtrace on the console. A photo was taken and is
available here:

A quick (incomplete) text transcript of the photo is here:

Unmounting filesystems (retry):
The problem has only manifested itself this once, so unfortunately not
reproducible on demand, but I hope that maybe someone more
knowledgable of NFS internals than me can figure out what went wrong
and a way to fix it in the future (if it's not already fixed) :-)
