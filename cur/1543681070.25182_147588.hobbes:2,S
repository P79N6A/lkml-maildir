Probably faster hardware. I think I'll decrease the iso penalty to just 1/2 
sized timeslices (ISO_PENALTY 2)

The logical conclusion of this idea where there is a dynamic policy assigned 
to interactive tasks is a dynamic policy assigned to non interactive tasks 
that get treated in the opposite way. I'll code something for that soon, now
