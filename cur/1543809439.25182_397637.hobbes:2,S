Subject: [PATCH] deadlock in ext2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi.
The attached patch addresses a deadlock possible in the ext2 file system
implementation.  This deadlock occurs when a file is removed from an ext2
file system which was mounted with the "sync" mount option.
The problem is that ext2_xattr_delete_inode() was invoking the routine,
sync_dirty_buffer(), using a buffer head which was previously locked via
lock_buffer().  The first thing that sync_dirty_buffer() does is to lock
the buffer head that it was passed.  It does this via lock_buffer().  Oops.
The solution is to unlock the buffer head in ext2_xattr_delete_inode()
before invoking sync_dirty_buffer().  This makes the code in
ext2_xattr_delete_inode() obey the same locking rules as all other
callers of sync_dirty_buffer() in the ext2 file system implementation.
    Thanx...
       ps
