As I suspected, pipes and sockets are the evil ones. Evidence:
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 140000 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 488
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 140000 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 489
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 140000 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 490
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 140000 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 492
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 140000 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 491
put_write_access: i_writecount = 0, i_mode = 10600 i_dev: 0 i_ino: 493
