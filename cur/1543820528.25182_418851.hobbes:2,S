A function declared as
void foo(int bar) throw();
cannot fail or throw.

The TakeLock object is completely different from the actual
lock object. The TakeLock object does _only_ call
spin_lock() and spin_unlock(), which are still out of line.

That is not true. Google for "d-pointer" for an example
on how you might do this.

By good design of the exception objects, which carry all needed
information when handling the exception.
I _don't- want to say, that C++ is good in the kernel.
My opinion is: C++ in the kernel is bad.
