Hello,
   create test scenario where first transmit of NCP request is lost by 
network, and before resend you kill this process.  So it stops 
resending, but local sequence count is already incremented.  Then when 
next process tries to access ncpfs, server will ignore its requests as 
it expects packet with sequence X, while packet with sequence X+1 arrived.
And unfortunately it is not possible to simple not increment sequence 
number unless you get reply - when server receives two packets with same 
sequence number, it simple resends answer it gave to first request, 
without looking at request's body at all.  So in this case server would 
answer, but would gave you bogus answer.
So only solution (as far as I can tell) is to keep retrying request 
until you get answer - only in this case you can be sure that client and 
server state machines are in same state - your solution will work if 
packet is never lost.  But as we talk about UDP and real networks, this 
assumption is not safe.
