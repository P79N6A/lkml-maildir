Thank you, Dave!
Attached is a patch that takes into account comments I have received in
response to the original patch I posted. Please peruse it, and if it looks
okay, please recommend that Marcelo pick it up for 2.4.22.
FYI, I have tested this patch on a PIII/440BX with a TI1225 based PCMCIA
card reader and Adaptec SlimSCSI 1460D SCSI adapter card connected to a
Fujitsu SCSI MO drive.
Thanks!
