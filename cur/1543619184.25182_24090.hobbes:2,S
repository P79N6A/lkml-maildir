Complete with "Patches only against 2.4.17 through 2.4.19", "Doesn't
compile con ARM with CONFIG_FOO", "Works fine on AXP"?
Plus search capability: Which files does it touch? What functions/variables
change/appear/dissapear? Etc?
Looks like a _HUGE_ ammount of work...

the following thread might have caveats, fixes, and important comments.
