This looks ok, but probably we could do it in a better way.
How about an api to thaw only a specific task something like
thaw_process(struct task_struct p). 
That way, the CPU_DEAD handler which wants to kthread_stop a thread
can selectively thaw the thread before it does kthread_stop.
Rafael, does this have any negative impact on the freezer design?
