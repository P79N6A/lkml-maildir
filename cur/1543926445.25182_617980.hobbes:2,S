 It depends on the exact setup and conditions.

 Well, if you see spurious interrupt detection triggered, then it is not a 
problem with the interrupt being delivered multiple times (that's handled 
silently by the interrupt dispatched), but likely the interrupt line being 
deasserted too late.  Does it happen frequently?  If your ERR counter in 
/proc/interrupts increments quite fast, then perhaps a driver does not 
handle interrupts well enough for your system.  Or there is noise on an 
interrupt line.
 You would have to provide more information to get more accurate feedback.
