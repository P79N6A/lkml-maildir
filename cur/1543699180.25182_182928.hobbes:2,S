Here's how I see it.
dev->serialize is meant to protect significant state changes, things like
set_configuration and device disconnect.  ps->devsem is meant to protect
against usbfs trying to do two things to the device at the same time.  
But you also want to protect against usbfs using the device during a state
change.  (The normal protection mechanisms don't work because usbfs might
be using a device without having a driver bound to any of its interfaces.)  
Given that, there's no reason usbfs shouldn't just use serialize instead
of devsem.
The fact that the core calls driver_disconnect with serialize already held 
then just makes your life simpler: You don't need to acquire the lock 
yourself!
The only tricky part is that you have to release serialize (which now is
your only lock) before calling set_configuration.  But as you said, you
would have to release ps->devsem anyway, so nothing's lost there.
Anything wrong with this approach?
