I like the idea of a hotplug event on media change (basically, a hotplug
event for partitions).  And, in fact, I am loath not to do it.
The current direction with the kernel and udev is letting us move _away_
from polling.  Projects such as HAL are helping to finally integrate
hardware management throughout the system.  But HAL is going to be very
confused by some of the alternative solutions for partitions: requiring
that all of the partition device nodes preexist is going to really
complicate things, and I really do not want to have to poll on all of
them in order for HAL to have an idea of what partitions are valid.
But I hear you loud and clear about dumb devices that cannot detect
media change.  They pose a problem.
I want a proper solution, too... ideas?
