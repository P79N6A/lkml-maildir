Yes, this might be a good idea.  The "core" driver looks like it is
suffering from really being several things stuck together.  It would
probably make things a lot cleaner and easier to maintain if the core
driver just handled synchronizing access to the low-level hardware,
with other stuff split into its own driver.  It seems there might even
be enough stuff to split "core" into three drivers: the real core, the
ultra-high-performance MPI transport, and the management/diagnostitcs
stuff.
Also, there are APIs in the "core" driver that are only exported for a
single user outside the driver -- it would probably make sense to move
that logic directly to where it's used.  I'm thinking of things like
ipath_verbs_send() and the whole ipath_copy.c file.
