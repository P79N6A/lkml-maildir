   To push the idea into ultimate:  AIO
   You open file, start IO, and do other things while the machine
   is doing IO.    Doing open() asynchronously would be ultimate,
   but alas, not particularly trivial.
   There are problems also in the AIO status rendezvous mechanisms.
   Your best choice could be (with moderation) to do synchronous
   operations at separate threads.
