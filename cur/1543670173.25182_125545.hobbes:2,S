Add an entry to the kernel bugzilla detailing the ALSA trouble. See Robert's 
post about checking logs and dmesg for errors.

I'm surprised by this, because Rui recently updated the 2.5 emu10k1 sources to 
match the 2.4.20 sources. There are very few difference (2.4.20 used in 
both). Make sure you don't have anything "alsa" compiled in anyway (is that 
even possible?).
I, myself, would like to use ALSA with my emu10k1, but presently the software 
tone controls have the most awful artifacts you can imagine (and are 
substantially inferior to the tone control dsp from the emu-tools package..) 
and the rear-speaker routings in ALSA do not scale with the master PCM slider 
(which only changes the front speakers). I used to have this problem in OSS, 
too, and it was due to routing problems, but I cannot see any emu10k1 
specific routing utilities in alsa-utils or alsa-tools (?) that do this. Nor 
should I have to, optimal settings should be the default, as is with the OSS 
driver.
Are these problems being worked on, or are these bugs I should report? At the 
present time, the ALSA driver is not a technically suitable for the ageing 
OSS driver. And it hasn't been since the original emu10k1 driver back in the 
pre-0.9.x days, so I find it difficult to believe there's a quick fix.
The emu-tools may be required to enable some of the routing in the new driver, 
I'm not sure. What I've done is install the emu tools, (edit the Makefile to 
install to /usr not /usr/local) move "emu-script" to /usr/bin (/etc is silly) 
and used the attached emu10k1.conf.
For managing the volume, I use umix from sourceforge.net (but anything similar 
e.g. aumix should suffice) and I've included a working volume profile from 
umix (I also had to hack the emu-script to use umix and not aumix; it's not 
very well designed).
I hope this helps.
Cheers,
Alistair.
