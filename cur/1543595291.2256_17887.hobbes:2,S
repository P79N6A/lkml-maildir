The IWILL problem seems unrelated. Its the board that more than others people
report fails totally when streaming memory copies using movntq instructions.
The Athlon optimised kernel places pretty much the absolute maximum load 
possible on the memory bus. Several people have reported that machines that
are otherwise stable on the bios fast options require  the proper conservative
settings to be stable with the Athlon optimisations
