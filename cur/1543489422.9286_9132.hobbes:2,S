Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
I had problems initially using my CDROM's too.  I then realized
that I didn't have the cdrom modules compiled the same way that I
did with 2.0.x.  With 2.0.x I had no IDE-CDROM compiled in, but
rather SCSI emulation compiled in.  In 2.2.x I have both
IDE-CDROM and IDE-SCSI compiled as modules.  So, I have to
manually load the driver prior to using the burner or CDROM.  I
could have it autoload easily enough I suppose, but I still boot
2.0.x and I'm not sure how to keep my conf.modules separate for
both without boot script kludges, or other trickery.

My HP is on hdc and my Toshiba is on hdd, both on the secondary.

I've got 5.1, manually upgraded partially to 5.2, with many other
stuff upgraded beyond 5.2, also with 2.2.x stuff applied.

That is for 2.0.x, the rules are different with 2.2.x.

Can't say... perhaps hdc=cdrom hdd=ide-scsi ?

Misconfiguration most likely.
