Subject: [PATCH] kobject: fix double kobject_put() in error path of kobject_add()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This fixes a problem introduced in the previous set of driver model
changes that has been seen by a lot of people (most notibly the greater
than 256 pty users, but others might also be hitting this without
realizing it.)
Also add a comment so we don't try to "fix" this again.
