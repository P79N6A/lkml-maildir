I'm still quite concerned about this in dual/quad core scenarios;
the frequency of both cores is the maximum of what linux sets each core to;
this means that if you're THIS sensitive to that there still is quite a nasty issue there.
I wonder if the various delay functions (maybe only in .25) should use the maximum observed loops_per_jiffie instead always (across cpus) to be super safe here.
