On a Pentium 4? ;)
Sure, that is a minor detail, considering that you'll usually be allocating
an order of magnitude or three more anon/pagecache pages than page tables.

The thing is, pagetable pages are the one really good exception to the
rule that we should keep cache hot and initialise-on-demand. They
typically are fairly sparsely populated and sparsely accessed. Even
for last level page tables, I think it is reasonable to assume they will
usually be pretty cold.
And you want to allocate cache cold pages as well, for the same reasons
(you want to keep your cache hot pages for when they actually will be
used - eg. for the anon/pagecache itself).

For slab I understand. And a lot of users of slab constructers were also
silly, precisely because we should initialise on demand to keep the cache
hits up.
But cold(ish?) pagetable quicklists make sense, IMO (that is, if you *must*
avoid using slab).

You can win on specifically constructed benchmarks, easily.
But considering all the other problems you're going to introduce, we'd need
a significant win on a significant something, IMO.
You waste memory bandwidth. You also use more CPU and memory cycles
speculatively, ergo you waste more power.
