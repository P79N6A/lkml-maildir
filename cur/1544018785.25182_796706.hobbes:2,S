I have a new Gateway DX4720-03 PC and have discovered that it won't 
install Fedora 10 unless I give the kernel boot option "noapic" or 
"nolapic".
This system's processor is the Intel Pentium Dual Core E5200.
It would seem that this is either a kernel bug to be fixed, or a 
documentation bug so users of this machine know about the workaround. 
I'll report the bug if someone will tell me how.
