Right now, simply by asking Marcelo. As he's moving his tree from BK to
git, I suspect we'll not see any intermediate merge before 2.4.32-pre1.

Here is a good place. Unfortunately, the thread pointed above ended
quickly, and it does not seem clear from this whether Paulo's patch
should be applied or not, as adding 1 jiffie at 100 Hz will result in
a (noticeable) 10 ms additionnal sleep time. If you know of applications
which break because of this problem, and there is a general consensus
stating that the patch will not break anything, I can issue a 2.4.31-hf1,
but it does not seem critical enough to justify a hotfix.
Regards,
Willy
