Because mod->usecount may be a totally inadequate way of determining
if a module is busy.  How does it work for LSM, for example?

Actually, I'm going to press you on why you think you even need a
two stage stop.  I know you have your reasons, but I doubt any of
the effects you aim at cannot be achieved with a single stage
stop/exit.  Could you please summarize the argument in favor of the
two stage stop?

He does?  That's not right.  ->start should clean up after itself if
it fails, like any other good Linux citizen.

I doubt it gives any new capability at all.  The same with the
entrenched separation at the user level between create and init
module: what does it give you that an error exit from a single
create/init would not?  Sure, I know it's not going to change,
but I'd like to know what the thinking was, and especially, if
there's a non-bogus reason, I'd like to know it.
