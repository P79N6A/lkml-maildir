Are we sure we are not talking about two different problems here.
I'm using RedHat and mkinitrd, in the initrd image there is already a 
skeleton /dev tree that contains my real-root device.  udev also exists 
in the initrd image.  I don't think any /dev device magic was necessary 
for me too mount root.
It is not clear Chris which tools you are using on initrd, standard 
Gentoo methods or a home brew setup ?  What shell is calling modprobe ?  
Can you confirm at what point you are seeing modprobe exit ?
* Immediatly (before device driver has detected hardware and reported / 
registered its findings).  This is the symptom I was seeing, but the 
cause was incorrect shell handling. 
* After detection but before device node creation.
* After device node creation.
FYI - This looks like the snippet from nash.c
