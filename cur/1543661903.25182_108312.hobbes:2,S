NAT should work correctly though.  It'd be nice if it didn't violate RFC
1323 by having non-monotonically increasing TCP timestamps for machines
that it is NAT'ing.  The RFC 1323 violations are proably just as useful as
the IPid field for this "NAT counting" *and* they can break things in
certain situations (e.g. receiving a SYN to a TIME_WAIT socket with a
smaller TCP timestamp).  I wouldn't mind at all if someone tried to fix
iptables so that it would do all the proper header munging to hide the
fact that there were multiple machines behind it (obviously this would be
slower, so it'd need to be an option that wasn't on by default...)
