I just shut down 2.4.22-pre7 to test a 2.6-test kernel, and it hung trying
to shut down the kernel nfs server.
And I just checked my version and it is a reported good version, 1.0.3-1.
I only saw it once, and I seem to recall rebooting pre7 before without
trouble, so maybe it is hard to produce. :-/
