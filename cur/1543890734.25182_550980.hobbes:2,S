Not at all... only my own debug messages from joydev (like:
recalibrating for value 2048) when a new limit is reached. I've even
changed "printk(KERN_DEBUG ...)" to a plain printk() as I do on joydev
to avoid fall into the wrong log level but didn't work as well.
I've changed USB DEBUG in menuconfig, saved the new conf.
The files I've changed manually (undef -> define) were:
 -> drivers/hid/
hid-core.c:#undef DEBUG
hid-core.c:#undef DEBUG_DATA
hid-input.c:#undef DEBUG
-> drivers/usb/input/
hid-core.c:#undef DEBUG
hid-core.c:#undef DEBUG_DATA
hid-ff.c:#undef DEBUG
hid-tmff.c:#undef DEBUG
than
$ make drivers/hid/hid.ko drivers/usb/input/usbhid.ko
$ rmmod usbhid hid ; modprobe usbhid hid
the output from the last mail was on both /var/log/messages and
syslog, although syslog had other messages from the network card
(using ndiswrapper).
