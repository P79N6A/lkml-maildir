Hi
I am running SuSE OpenExchange Server version 4.  This server is based off the 2.4.19 kernel.  Since my server is a multi-processor machine, it has installed the SMP version of the standard kernel. 
Unfortunatly, the kernel sources are the standard sources used to build that standard single-processor kernel.  I need to build the drbd kernel module, but it keeps using the version '2.4.19-4gb' found in the version.h file.  If i change the VERSION statement to read '2.4.19-64GB-SMP' in the version.h file, will this break anything?
Thanks,
Lee
