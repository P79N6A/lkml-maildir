I suppose the patch is pretty good (IIRC Martin liked the idea).
I guess it will at least increase the incidence of copy+paste,
if not getting people to think harder ;)
Can I be lame and ask that you keep this around until closer
to 2.6.10? I have a few possible scheduler performance
improvments that I'd like to get tested in -mm after 2.6.9
and this would make things a bit harder :P
I don't think anyone is looking at getting any tweaks in before
then...
