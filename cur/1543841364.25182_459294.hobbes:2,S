Subject: [patch 0/6] RFC: fault-injection capabilities (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Changes from last version
- use lightweight random simulator instead of get_random_int()
- added per queue filter for disk IO failures
  (/sys/blocks/sda/sda1/make-it-fail, /sys/blocks/sda/make-it-fail)
- added process filter
  (/debug/{failslab,fail_page_alloc,fail_make_request}/process-filter,
   /proc/<pid>/make-it-fail)
---
This patch set provides some fault-injection capabilities.
- kmalloc failures
- alloc_pages() failures
- disk IO errors
We can see what really happens if those failures happen.
In order to enable these fault-injection capabilities:
1. Enable relevant config options (CONFIG_FAILSLAB, CONFIG_PAGE_ALLOC,
   CONFIG_MAKE_REQUEST) and runtime configuration kernel module
   (CONFIG_SHOULD_FAIL_KNOBS)
2. build and boot with this kernel
3. modprobe should_fail_knob
4. configure fault-injection capabilities behavior by debugfs
For example about kmalloc failures:
/debug/failslab/probability
	specifies how often it should fail in percent.
/debug/failslab/interval
	specifies the interval of failures.
/debug/failslab/times
	specifies how many times failures may happen at most.
/debug/failslab/space
	specifies the size of free space where memory can be allocated
	safely in bytes.
/debug/failslab/process-filter
	enable process filter.
5. see what really happens.
