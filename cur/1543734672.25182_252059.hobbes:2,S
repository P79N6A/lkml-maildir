The only point I had to make was that I'd rather avoid adding arch
hooks for code that will never be run on the arch. I suppose for the
sake of compiletesting...

Add atomic_sub_and_test() to sparc32, implemented in terms of
atomic_sub_return(),  so reiser4 can be simultaneously microoptimized
and made to pass compilation testing on sparc32.
