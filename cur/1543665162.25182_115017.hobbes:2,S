Well, that would only be true with a really crappy CPU with no caches.
Polling the same location (as long as it's a pure poll, not trying to do 
some locked read-modify-write cycle) should be fine. At least for 
something like idle-polling, where the one location it _is_ polling should 
not actually be touched by anybody else until the wakeup actually happens.
