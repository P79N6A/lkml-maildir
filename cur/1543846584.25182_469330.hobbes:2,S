It is completely possible to do what you describe without special
syscall parameters. Just add interesting signals to the queue (and
optionally block them globally) and wait on that queue.
When signal's event is generated and appropriate kevent is removed, that
signal will be restored in global signal mask (there are appropriate
enqueue/dequeue callbacks which can perform operations on signal mask
for given process).
My main consern is to not add special cases for something in generic
code, especially when gneric code can easily handle that situations.
