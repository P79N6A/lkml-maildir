maybe because it is easier to look at the code than to understand the
subtleties of English language. If you show us the code that protects the
variable with a lock then it would be much easier for people to say "No,
you don't need a lock here".
big reader spinlocks are optimized for large number of frequent readers
and few infrequent writers. If your scenario fits this - use it, i.e. if
you _do_ need a lock at all. All the mails in this thread were interesting
but none convinced me that you need a lock at all (as long you are
accessing some bitmaps in an atomic manner using standard functions like
test_bit()/set_bit() etc etc.)
