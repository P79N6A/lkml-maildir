True. The board I have an uartlite on also has a 8250 so it hasn't
been an issue for me so far - But it would indeed be a nice
addition. Adding new stuff to arch/ppc at this moment isn't that
sensible, so perhaps it makes most sense to wait til 4xx is supported
under arch/powerpc?

Huh, that's odd - I haven't noticed that. I'll test it again and get
back to you.

Yes - Afaik none of the Xilinx boards comes with uartlites
configured so it's not usable out-of-the-box, but you can ofcause do a
setup with the proper #ifdefs like the 8250 stuff in virtex.c.
