Re. kernel 2.0.x, I have seen cases where the ICMP response is not
masqueraded (internal network address is on the packet which hits the
external interface) and therefore dies once hitting the firewall.  How to
avoid this seems to be a repeating question on the linux-masq list.  I've
been told it's been brought up on the masq-dev list as well.
All other ICMP packets seem to be masqueraded properly, only ICMP/3
responses are noted in the rejection logs.  If the packet is stopped at the
firewall, or is sent having an internal address, MTU path discovery cannot
be working properly.
I know many people who would love to get a handle on this.  How can we help?
