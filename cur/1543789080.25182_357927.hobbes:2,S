Hi all,
 I want to use the sendto (or sendmsg) for sending raw packets on a raw
 socket directly to the NIC (passing the kernel protocol stack).
 In addition to that i need so send a lot of packets (100-200Kpps) so i
 have to do that fast.
 Currently the kernel-user switching is killing me and i want to batch
 some packets before calling send() - to reduce the user-kernel switch
 overhead.
 Passing a batched buffer to the sendto() cause a probelm - the NIC have
 to get one message at a time because it has to calculate the L2 CRC for
 each packet (or msg). so batched buffer is not acceptable.
 I would like to get some help please. any one have any idea how to
 reduce the user-kernel overhead (or sending a batched buffer so the
 kernel will call sendto for each buffer)?
 Thanks,
 Aviv
