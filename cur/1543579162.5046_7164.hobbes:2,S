Subject: [DISCUSSION]: 2.4.1-pre8: Detection of CD-ROM/CD-R/CD-RW drives

In 2.4.1-pre8, this info appears in dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: YAMAHA    Model: CRW2100E          Rev: 1.0H
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
hdc: YAMAHA CRW2100E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
This model isn't DVD ;)
It's a CD-ROM/CD-R/RW drive 8MB cache 40x read, as detected by the
standard ATAPI drivers. the SCSI emulation doesnt appear to detect the
right kind of drive (its assuming its a CD-ROM only?)
