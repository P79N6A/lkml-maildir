It's not a bug, it's a feature =). While I totally agree with you that for 
the common case, you probably do want to avoid work in the userspace after 
taking the snapshot, it is something that should be solved separately. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking a snapshot, doing some work, 
and then resuming to the snapshot and thus "losing" some the work (this 
is useful for debugging, for example).
