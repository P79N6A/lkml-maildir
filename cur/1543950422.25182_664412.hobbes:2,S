The wrong bit is in calls to write_debugctlmsr, only used when setting up a
thread to step.  It does not affect context switch, so it would never have
an effect on other tasks as you suggest here.

That doesn't happen in the trivial sense of "never", because in the normal
case an actual block-step exception happens and that makes the hardware
clear BTF from the MSR (as well as TF from eflags).  So it would only come
up in a more obscure case.  That is, you set up for block-step but didn't
actually finish the user-mode instruction block.  e.g. interrupted by a
signal or faulting instruction.  The child stops again but not by SIGTRAP,
and next time you don't block-step it.  Then, the BTF bit stays set in
thread.debugctlmsr and gets switched back in when the child runs again.
If you then resume with single-step instead, it will block-step because
BTF is set, but you wanted instruction-step.  Like I said, I didn't
produce a case that behaved that way.  I may be overlooking something.
But that's the scenario I imagine.

Correct.
