Well, I did test it, but skge didn't even find the hardware :-(
No device was created, no dmesg output on load.
Instead I am running 2.6.13.1 with sk98lin-8.23.1.3.patch
The MB is ASUS P5GDC-V-Deluxe and the the on-board NIC:
# lspci -v  -s 02:00.0

I am not sure it is supposed to be used with the skge driver, but I
thought it will work... Some ASUS boards apparently have problems 
with the VPD being broken, but I am not sure how to check that.
