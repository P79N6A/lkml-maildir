The following ten patches add the core of CKRM (Class Based Resource
Management) to Linux.  Current patches are against 2.6.10-rc2.  This
set of patches is essentailly a cleaned up version of what is
known on the ckrm-tech@lists.sourcerforge.net as the E16 code base.
As compared to E16, the patch breakout has been reorganized for easier
application to mainline with a number of stylistic cleanups more
in line with mainline kernel code.
The following patches include:
01-diff_ckrm_events:
	Base CKRM events, mods to existing kernel code
02-diff_delay_acct:
	More accurate accounting for CPU scheduling, IO scheduling
03-diff_ckrm_core:
	Main/core CKRM code, beginings of Resource Control Filesystem
04-diff_rcfs:
	Full directory suppport for rcfs
05-diff_taskclass:
	Task based management for CPU, memory and Disk I/O.
06-diff_sockclass:
	CKRM tracking for socket classes for inbound connection control,
	bandwidth control, etc.
07-diff_numtasks:
	Resource controller for number of tasks per class.
08-diff_listenaq:
	Resource Controller for prioritizing inbound connection
	requests.  Can control queue weights for multiple accept
	queues.
09-diff_rbce
	A very basic rules based classification engine for automatically
	adding tasks to classes.  Also includes an enhanced rules based
	classification engine with better per-process delay data and
	ability to better monitor class related activities.
10-diff_docs
	CKRM documentation.
