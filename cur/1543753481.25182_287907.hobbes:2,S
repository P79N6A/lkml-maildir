might this disagreement be based on the fact that exec-shield _is_ being
actively developed and is in active use in Fedora/RHEL, and that split
out portions of exec-shield (e.g. flexmmap, PT_GNU_STACK, NX) are
already in the upstream kernel?
(but no doubt PaX is fine and protects against exploits at least as
effectively as (and in some cases more effectively than) exec-shield, so
you've definitely not made a bad choice.)
