>From my POV there's two different problems discussed recently:
- updatedb type of workloads that add tons of inodes and dentries in the
slab caches which of course use the pagecache.
- streaming large files (read or copying) that fill the pagecache with
useless used-once data
swap prefetch fix the first case, drop-behind fix the second case.
Both have the same symptoms but the cause is different.
Personally updatedb doesn't really hurt me.  But I don't have that many
files on my desktop.  I've tried the swap prefetch patch in the past and
it was not so noticeable for me. (I don't doubt it's helpful for others)
But every time I read or copy a large file around (usually from a
server) the slowdown is noticeable for some moments.
I just wanted to point this out, if it wasn't clean enough for everyone.
I hope both problems get fixed.
