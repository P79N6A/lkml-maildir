I need to copy large (> 100GB) files between machines on a fast
network.  Both machines have reasonably fast disk subsystems, with
read/write performance benchmarked at > 800 MB/sec. Using 10GigE cards
and the usual tweaks to tcp_rmem etc., I am getting single-stream TCP
throughput better than 600 MB/sec.
My question is how best to move the actual file.  NFS writes appear to
max out at a little over 100 MB/sec on this configuration.  FTP and
rcp give me around 250 MB/sec.  Thus I am planning to write custom
code to send and receive the file.
For sending, I believe my best options are:
1) O_DIRECT read() + send()
2) mmap() + madvise(WILLNEED) + send()
3) fadvise(WILLNEED) + sendfile()
I am leaning towards (3), since I gather that sendfile() is supposed
to be pretty fast.
My question is what to do on the receiving end.  In short, if I want
the equivalent of a "recvfile()" to go with sendfile(), what is my
best bet on Linux?
I will probably try recv() + O_DIRECT write(), but I am curious if
there are other approaches I should try.
Thanks!
