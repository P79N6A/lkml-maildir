Pavel,
during testing of the encrypted swsusp_image on x86_64 I did get an Oops
from time to time at memcpy+11 called from swsusp_save+1090 which turns
out to be the memcpy in copy_data_pages() of swsusp.c.
The Oops is caused by a NULL pointer (I don't remember if it was source
or destination).
This Oops seems to be unrelated to the encrypted image addition as I
didn't touch any code in that area.
