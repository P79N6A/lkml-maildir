There isn't but some of the real ones are passable guides to how to
write something that works, especially if it is PCI bus. I'd also look
at libata and the libata PATA patch if you are working towards the
future rather than just needing something that works with the current
IDE layer.
What sort of hardware do you need to write a driver for ?
