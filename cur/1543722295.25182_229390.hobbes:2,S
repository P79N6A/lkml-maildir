OK, I looked into this more closely, and gave procps 3.2.1 a spin.
This gives us a similar speedup (top now only consumes 60% of a CPU)
to that which I obtained by cacheing symbol lookups and using an old
procps.  This difference is certainly explainable by top now only
obtaining wchan information for displayed processes.
60% is far better than 800%, so this is certainly progress.  However
60% is also still quite a bit of CPU time.  I'll spend some cycles
trying to whittle it down some more, but I'm not all that hopeful.
Thanks for the discussion, it was certainly enlightening.
