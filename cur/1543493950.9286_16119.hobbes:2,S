I hate answering my own mail, but here goes, I modified
../linux/fs/proc/root.c, line 596, to provide a phony size of 1000
bytes for /proc/interrupts. 
It now works with sed and less. The premature EOF doesn't seem to hurt.
You may want to perform such a test on whatever else you find appropriate.
If everything seems to work okay, then ask Linus. It's his code. There
is zero overhead to making such a phony size, but, as I said, it's
Linus' code. He may have a good reason for zero-length files.
Cheers,
