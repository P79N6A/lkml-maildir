	IPMI top-level message handler (IPMI_HANDLER) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) ?
	This enables the central IPMI message handler, required for IPMI
	to work.  Note that you must have this enabled to do any other IPMI
	things.  See IPMI.txt for more details.
	IPMI top-level message handler (IPMI_HANDLER) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) 
Telling me what IPMI is, and why I might need it, would be a good
thing...  Please, Corey, I'm feeling generation-gapped by the
acronyms...
Thanks!
Rusty.
