Well, I agree it's supposed to work, what I don't agree about is that
generic code gets to designate critical data as volatile.

This is a real problem for us on parisc though.  By designating the
function prototype as volatile, you force the function implementation
*also* to be volatile.  Unfortunately, in our case, gcc seems to
generate worse code than a pigs arse when it sees volatile data lurking
anywhere in a function.
Our current set bit functions are *coded* to operate on volatile data,
we just don't use the volatile keyword to persuade gcc to generate
better code.
I realise we could hand code in assembly to get around this problem, but
our implementation actually has to use hashed spinlocks for the
volatility, so we'd rather not if we really don't have to.
The kernel has survived this far with no other bit operator data being
volatile.

Definitely agree here ... the arch code is really the place we know the
compiler penalty of being volatile.
