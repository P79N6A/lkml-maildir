The point is that your audio application can to control external programs.
example: assume you play on your MIDI keyboard notes which go into a
linux software synthesizer which must use <20ms audio buffers so that you don't
notice the the delay (between a MIDI keystroke and the output of the sound from
the soundcard) while playing your song.
If for some reason disk activity occurs, (for example because GIMP is just
saving your 10MB  JPG picture on disk),
there is a high probability that sound dropouts may occur.

Yes, if you write 150Kb/sec (in background) during audio playing, you will get
fewer sound dropouts, than writing at maximum rate,
but actually the kernel give no guarantee that the RT scheduled ram audio
player, will not block <20ms

in sync mode the disk really SUCKS, I don't made any benchmarks but I can say
the disk is SEVERAL times slower ( >5 or so).
But  I think that the reason because in sync mode you get these nice low-latency
results, is that the kernel blocks for fewer time, because it writes smaller
pieces at time but more often.

This is the main thing which must happen to enable Linux to run realtime
audio-applications.
I think it's a very important feature, which should be included before kernel
2.4 comes out, to enable vendors to port their nice audio apps to Linux.

"One day in the future the audio layer has to run without the kernel lock.
However by then its likely to be ALSA. Getting the SMP locking right will
be fun, I dont think its worth repeating the effort for dead code (ie OSS),
nor will it help you anyway as your lock understanding isnt quite right"
Alan, do you know if MIDI I/O or serial I/O suffer of high scheduling
latencies in a similar manner like audio I/O when heavy disk I/O is performed ?
I ask this because a classic MIDI software synthesizer works as follows:
while(1)
{
  read() MIDI note from MIDI interface
  render the audio in a small buffer
  write() buffer to /dev/dsp
} 
therefore even if the write() to /dev/dsp has no locks anymore, the read() of
the MIDI note need low latency too, 
what if the note is read from a MIDI interface connected to a standard serial
port ? ( are there some disadvantages over the soundcard's own MIDI port ?)

Benno.
