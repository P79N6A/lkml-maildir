Subject: [PATCH 21/28] sysfs: error handling in sysfs, fill_read_buffer()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/7/320

From: Oliver Neukum <oliver@neukum.name>
if a driver returns an error in fill_read_buffer(), the buffer will be
marked as filled. Subsequent reads will return eof. But there is
no data because of an error, not because it has been read.
Not marking the buffer filled is the obvious fix.
