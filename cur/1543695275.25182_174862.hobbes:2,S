The intel compiler supports C99 just fine.
x86-64 always used C99 and there is no x86-64 compiler 
around that doesn't support it. I must say I was somewhat pissed off
that someone added that nasty warning to the toplevel Makefile
just to comfort some gcc 2.95 users on i386 ("all world is a i386")
I have enough trouble just to get the essential bug/compilefixes accepted
by Linus, so I see no chance to get such things in currently.
