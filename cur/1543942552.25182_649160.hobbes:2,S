Correct.

Every iteration must perform a different lookup. The cpu variable is 
passed to get_cpu_slab().

No it still gives all the events on the processors that are up which is 
consistent in some way (and its only stats). There is really no clean 
solution. Same situation as with the event counters in the VM. We could 
fold them into some other processor when it goes down. Yuck.
