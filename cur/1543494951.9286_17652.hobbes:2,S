  1.  Introduction
  The main goal of this document is to get you started with running a
  dual head configuration of Linux.  While this process is pretty
  straight forward there are numerous things that one can do wrong
  along the way.
  The example I concentrate on is getting an X-server running on a
  second monitor.  I find this nice as you can usually find old large
  19" to 21" fixed frequency monitors around that people are giving
  away because they can't use them.  This way you can boot off a small
  multisync and then use X on a nice big monitor.
  Please understand dual head support is currently developing so this
  information changes rapidly.  Anything in this document could be out
  of date or just plain incorrect by the time you are reading this.

  2. What hardware is supported?
  Most video cards assume they will be the only one in the system and are
  permanently set with the addressing of the primary display adapter.  There
  are a few exceptions.
  *  Matrox cards: This includes Matrox Millennium, Matrox Millennium II,
     Matrox Mystique, Matrox Mystique 220, Matrox Productiva G100, Matrox
     Mystique G200, Matrox Millennium G200 and Matrox Marvel G200
     video cards
  *  MDA: This includes monochrome Hercules graphics adapter among others.
          This for text only second head support.
  2.1 Commercial support
  This mini-HOWTO in primarily concerned with free software.  However,
  there are commercial X servers with multi-head support.  These
  include Metro Link's (www.metrolink.com) Metro-X and Xi Graphics'
  (www.xig.com) Accelerated-X.
  ______________________________________________________________________
  3. Getting all the stuff.
      You'll need the following patches and programs:
      * "fbset" program
         try: 
http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~geert/bin/
      * "fbaddon" Matrox dual head patches for Linux kernel
         try: 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/
      * "con2fb" program
         try: 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/
      * The X11 frame buffer server XF86_FBDev.  This is a standard
         part of XFree86 3.3.1.
  ______________________________________________________________________
   4. Getting Started
   The first thing you'll need to do is to patch a copy of the Linux
   source with the "fbaddon" patch.  Then you need to configure the
   kernel and turn on frame buffer support.  If you have Matrox cards
   turn on Matrox unified accelerated driver support as well as the
   particular type of card you have.  Don't turn on VESA frame buffer
   support. It can cause a conflict.  Do turn on multi-head support
   (obviously).  Build the kernel and reboot.
   Now you need to install the "fbset" program and carefully read all
   the documentation on how to adjust the settings.  Using a
   "/etc/fb.modes" file is highly recommended once you've decided on
   your settings.  The fbset program includes a Perl script to convert
   your XF86Config file to fb.modes settings.  I've included my
   octave/Borne shell script to convert your XF86Config file in
   Appendix A & B.
   You need to get comfortable with using the frame buffer device on
   one monitor, understanding any issues that can arise from your set
   up that have nothing to do with multi-head support.  This can save
   a lot of head scratching later.
   I'm going to concentrate my explanation on getting X running on the
   second monitor as doing most other configurations will just be a
   obvious subset of the procedure.
  4.1 Move a console over...
  Compile the "con2fb" program.  If you run it without any arguments
  you'll get the following usage message: 
  "usage: con2fb fbdev console".
  Thus, an example command would be "con2fb /dev/fb1 /dev/tty6" to
  move virtual console number six over to the second monitor.  Use
  Ctrl-Alt-F6 to move over to that console and see that it does indeed
  show up on the second monitor.
  4.2 Use "fbset" to adjust the setting on this second monitor
  Only set the "fbset" settings on the monitor you run the "fbset"
  command on.  Therefore, you must be careful to use the "-fb" flag on
  the second monitor.  In particular, if you do nothing else you'll
  probably want to at least set the virtual vertical resolution to
  your actually vertical resolution.  
     e.g. "fbset -fb /dev/fb1 -vyres 600"
  This will seriously slow down text mode, but X will be obnoxious
  without it.
  4.3 Set up X for Frame Buffer support.
  The framebuffer.txt file explains this better than I can, but here's 
  the two important points.
  Make sure you set the link for "X" to point to "XF86_FBDev".
  Next you need to add a monitor section to your XF86Config file
  for the frame buffer device.  Here's an example:
# The Frame Buffer server
Section "Screen"
    Driver      "fbdev"
    Device      "Millennium"
    Monitor     "NEC MultiSync 5FGp"
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       8
        Modes       "default"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       16
        Modes       "default"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       24
        Modes       "default"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       32
        Modes       "default"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
EndSection
  Use the "default" modes as I don't think any other one will work with
  the Matrox frame buffer.
  4.4 Try starting the X server on the second monitor.
  Set the variable FRAMEBUFFER to the second frame buffer.
      "export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1"
              or
      "setenv FRAMEBUFFER /dev/fb1"
  You need to start the X server so that it both matches the selected
  color depth and it appears on the same monitor you start the X server
  from.  
     e.g. "startx -- -bpp 16 vt06"
  This example will start the X server on virtual console six with 16
  bit color.
  ______________________________________________________________________
  5. Summary
  The steps involved in getting an X server running on a second monitor
  can be summarized as follows:
  * Get the kernel patch, fbset, and con2fb.
  * Patch the kernel, configure, rebuild, and reboot.
  * Add XF86_FBDev section to XF86Config file and set X link.
  Then each time you reboot:
  * Move a console over.  e.g. "con2fb /dev/fb1 /dev/tty6"
  * Adjust the settings   e.g. "fbset -fb /dev/fb1 1280x1024"
  * Set the FRAMEBUFFER.  e.g. "export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1"
  * Start the X server.   e.g. "startx -- -bpp 16 vt06"
  You can automate this each time you reboot via a shell alias.  It 
  must be an alias and not a shell script since it needs to detect the
  current console number.  This is my C-shell alias to start up X on
  a second fixed frequency monitor:
    alias startxfb = "
    setenv FRAMEBUFFER /dev/fb\!*;    # Set the env var to the cmd arg.
    con2fb $FRAMEBUFFER /dev/$tty;    # Move the fb to the current tty.
    fbset -fb $FRAMEBUFFER 1280x1024@62;  # Favorite from /etc/fb.modes
    startx -- -bpp 16 vt0`echo $tty | cut -dy f 2`'  # X on this tty.
    "
  In my .cshrc file these are all on the same line together without
  the comments, but it's easier to read here with line breaks and
  comments inserted.  I just give the number of the frame buffer as an
  argument and it starts right up.
  I'm not sure how to do this same alias in bash.  I don't know how to
  determine the current tty or get the arguments to an alias in
  bash.  If someone lets me know I'll insert it here.
  ______________________________________________________________________
  6. Other Notes and Problems
  * Both "fbset" and "startx" MUST be run from the same frame buffer
    as the one being affected.  This places serious limits on how much
    of these commands can be automated via scripts.
  * XFree86 4.0 will have multi-head support, but 3.3.1 does not.  Since
    you can only have one X server running on one machine at a time, only
    one monitor can be in X at a time.
  * The monitor that's not selected doesn't always preseve it's state
    when not active. (But it usually does.)
  * Linus Torvalds doesn't agree with the current multi-head console
    support changes so it may never be in the mainstream kernel tree.
    (This was heard third hand and may be wildly untrue.)
  * If you "break the rules" and start the X server (run "startx")
    from a different monitor, the machine can eventually crash badly
    with the keyboard and mouse input all mixed together.
  * The documentation framebuffer.txt in the kernel source explains
    that you can use the Modeline settings in your XF86Config file
    directly when running X.  Using the Matrox frame buffer seems to
    force the X server to drop all of those.  So you can only have the
    one ("default") setting at at time (the same one you had in text
    mode).
  * The XF86_FBDev is unaccelerated.  However, there are patches for
    accelerated Matrox support at
