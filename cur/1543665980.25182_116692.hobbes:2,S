Greetings -
2.5.64-mm4 and -mm5 seem more rugged than previous
kernels, but there are a couple of minor nits - one of them
is the tendency of named (which appears to work reliably
under 2.4) to go catatonic under recent 2.5.6x kernels -
More verbose kernel logging may shed some light - or is
this just a red herring? I get a tons of these in 2.5.64-mm5:
<...>
process `named' is using obsolete setsockopt SO_BSDCOMPAT
process `named' is using obsolete setsockopt SO_BSDCOMPAT
process `named' is using obsolete setsockopt SO_BSDCOMPAT
<...>
Anybody here running a compliant version of named?
(This is the bind 9.2.1 which ships with Red Hat 8.0)
Best Regards,
Joe
