If you have a good implementation of shadow paging, you are supposed
to write to disk the minimun amount of data possible, i.e. only the
things that have changed/are new.  The method of writing the new data
to free blocks and then change only the root is a known and used
mechanism in shadow page implementations.
Later, Juan.
