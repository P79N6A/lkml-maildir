This sounds very much as if you got your keyboard into scancode mode 1.
(Ordinarily a key-up event gets scancode of key-down but with
high-order bit set. In scancode set 1, a key-up event get the
scancode of key-down prefixed by 0xf0. Since the high-order bit
is masked here, this 0xf0 would show up as 0x70.
Moreover, the key-up for a sequence like e0 71 is e0 f0 71,
again what you see here.)
How you got into scancode mode 1 I don't know
(maybe by sending the command f0 01 to the keyboard).
Do things improve if you rip this strange messy AUX_RECONNECT
stuff out of drivers/char/pc_keyb.c?
