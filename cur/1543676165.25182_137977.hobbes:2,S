You have a large number of `ps' instances which appear to be
stuck on /proc's i_sem and lots of processes stuck in
sched_balance_exec->set_cpus_allowed->wait_for_completion.
The latter is a NUMA-special.  You might want to examine the
sched_best_cpu() fixes carefully.  Also see whether 2.5.70+bk
does the same thing.
