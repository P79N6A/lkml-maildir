Last week I posted a patch to fix a samll problem in ioremap().  Thanks to
Petr Vandrovec for pointing out some problems with it.  This one should be
better.
Summary: the 2.2.1 ioremap does not allow mapping of the very top of
physical space (right up to 0xFFFFFFFF).  This should fix that problem and
moves two lines of code so that requests that extend past the top of
physical space fail in the intended way.
