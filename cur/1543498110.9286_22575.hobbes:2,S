Erm. There is a third way it could be done. I don't know about any
specific implementations but the Backplane/bus bridge could implement
byte swapping merely by the way the data lines are connected. 
If I had this problem and was building a motherboard, I would seriously
consider going this route, unless there was a good reason not to.
Judging by the rest of this thread I assume no-one does it, which is a
shame. But I suppose if endian-ness was never specified.... sigh.
