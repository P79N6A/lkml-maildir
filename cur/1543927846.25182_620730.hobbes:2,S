I am hopeful that the sata_mv has this bug (I proved that the
problem I was experiencing was due to the sata_mv driver 
with 3.75Gig or more of memory)...
I am on vacation for a week or more ...or I'd tell you today
if it did have this bug!

Mmm.. I wonder how many other libata drivers have this exact same bug,
whether noticed yet or not ?
