I like this.  Even better would be if all platforms could do the same.
I'm definitely interested in doing something similar for ia64 (the
getunwind() syscall was always just a stop-gap solution).
I assume that these kernel ELF images would then show up in
dl_iterate_phdr()?
To complete the picture, it would be nice if the kernel ELF images
were mappable files (either in /sysfs or /proc) and would show up in
/proc/PID/maps.  That way, a distributed application such as a remote
debugger could gain access to the kernel unwind tables on a remote
machine (assuming you have a remote filesystem).
