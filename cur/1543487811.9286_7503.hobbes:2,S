the content of t->prev does not matter to the outcome of add_timer().
_usually_ a nonzero t->prev means an already active timer has been added,
but sometimes it's not. So we should just assume everything was done OK,
but we will print a debugging message. (so we catch the case when the
timer is really already added). We could also check wether the timer has
already been added (it's simple), but i think we want all kernel code to
use init_timer() to initialize timers, this way we can assure correctness
when in the future we change the timer abstraction.
(one example of a 'correct' add_timer() is in scsi_error.c, the attached
patch from Alan Cox fixes the debugging message)
