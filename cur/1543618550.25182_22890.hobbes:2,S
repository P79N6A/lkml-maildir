Eh, it signals init to go to runlevel 0. Apparently it is some kind of 
wrapper.

Another broken BIOS implementation...
Btw. I'm running with BIOS 1005A. I did not dare to flash to 1007 as the 
flash program is telling me, that the 1007 BIOS is for "A7V133-C" while 
my current BIOS is for "<A7V133>"...

Eh, is that the pmtools package? If so, I have put output from the 
programs at

If the Linux ACPI implementation takes over control of the button, it 
should be ok or what?

I just tried the same ACPI configuration as you; no change - it still 
hangs at 'Power off.'.

I have put it in the same place 
(
http://www.amagerkollegiet.dk/~moffe/acpi/
) as acpi-old.txt. Also there 
is the dmesg from the kernel with the acpi-patch (from the intel site) 
applied.

Done (however I'm not a list member myself).

I've put the output from 'lspci -vvv -xx' on the same site 
(
http://www.amagerkollegiet.dk/~moffe/acpi/
) if it should show up to be 
helpful.
