Before asking firs you must try look on current ZFS on FUSE 
discuss phorums/docu .. like on: 
http://groups.google.com/group/zfs-fuse/feed/rss_v2_0_msgs.xml
ZFS on Solaris provides for many workloads better speed than any Linux 
technology on the same hardware but ZFS ond FUSE in current form provides 
lower speed than now avalaible Linux technologies.
Example 
http://groups.google.com/group/zfs-fuse/msg/5b10c69707a46c07
:
"According to bonnie, I see 125 MB/s reads on ext3+RAID5, 65 MB/s on 
ZFS+RAID5 (using Linux's software RAID) and 20 MB/s on ZFS+raidz (using 
the same raw drives).  Writes are also proportionally slower.  The real 
performance hit with ZFS-FUSE was random accesses for lots of small files. 
The bonnie++ results showed something like 75 random seeks for ZFS vs 470 
for ext3 (..)"
On the same phorun you can find threads with discuss about utilize 
treading under FUSE.

You meam "guaranteed worser latency" ? excelent 8-)
