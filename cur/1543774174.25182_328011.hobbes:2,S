Agreed.

That's a fair point.  A separate script would be better.

For my use, I require all "Linus official tags" to be present in all my 
kernel trees, precisely because it is a big sync point for many people.
User A sends me a patch against 2.6.12-rc2, user B sends me a patch 
against 2.6.12-rc3, user C sends me a patch against 2.6.12...  I create 
a branch with
	cp .git/refs/tags/$kversion .git/refs/heads/foo-net-drvr
	git checkout -f foo-net-drvr
apply the patch, then pull linux-2.6.git to merge up to the latest version.
So in my case, the rare case is the 99% common case :)
I suppose this usage is just highly specific to me.
