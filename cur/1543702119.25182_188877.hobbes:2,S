Is there any special setting to be made for the new kernel? I have used module-init-tools-0.9.14 to install the modules.

I had a similar problem; works fine on 2.4 but not 2.6.  Turned out the 
module worked, but the kernel wasn't automatically loading it.  Try 
doing 'lsmod' to see if it's loaded (eepro100 I think the module is 
called?) and then 'insmod eepro100' if it's not.
