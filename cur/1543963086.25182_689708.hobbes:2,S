100% agreed, I'll nuke it as it seems really a noop.

Great. About your other deadlock I'm curious if my deadlock fix for
the i_mmap_sem patch helped. That was crashing kvm with a VM 2G in the
swap + a swaphog allocating and freeing another 2G of swap in a
loop. I couldn't reproduce any other problem with KVM since I fixed
that bit regardless if I apply only mmu-notifier-core (2.6.26 version)
or the full patchset (post 2.6.26).
