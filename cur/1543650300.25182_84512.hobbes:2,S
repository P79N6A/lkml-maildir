Judging from the mail archive above: instead of checking uid vs. euid
and gid vs. egid, ask the kernel and grant or deny LD_PRELOAD
according to the dumpable flag (see prctl(2)). This flag is set to
false, if uid != euid, etc. So, this flag could be used/cleared by
capabilities as well.

I remember this hack and since I hear this claim every now and then, I
downloaded his patch and verified with the source. Pavel's capability
patch was about _restricting_ not granting capabilities, so it's more
like an inheritable, rather than a permitted, set.
At least that was his intention. I didn't verify this with the
appropriate kernel sources from 1999.
