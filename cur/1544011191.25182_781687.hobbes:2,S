Subject: Re: [PATCH] get rid of the last symlink in uml build
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	BTW, after taking a look at the remaing asm-*...
* frv, m32r and h8300 should be as trivial as git mv
* m68k has a bit of extra PITA - we need to clean up two non-trivial
  includes from m68knommu (pci.h and setup.h) first, then it's a matter
  of git mv, adding arch/m68k/include to search path on m68knommu and
  removal of dummy headers from the latter.
* xtensa is already moved in linux-next
* arm seems to be lacking the final push for few remaining headers; presumably
  will happen eventually
* mn10300 is playing with symlinks - the last one to do that for headers,
  AFAICS.
I've thrown together a patch series on top of linux-next doing m68k and
mn10300.  *WARNING* - it's completely untested, basically about half an
hour diversion from sifting through the mailbox for missed VFS patches.
And that half and hour did *not* include anything resembling building
the resulting tree.  So take that with a trainload of salt.
Patches (in mbox format; easier to deal with for massive moves) follow.
Have fun.  If that actually works and if frv/m32r/h8300 are as trivial
as they seem to be, we should be able to get it down to include/asm-arm
remnants and nothing else.
			Al, disappearing back into the VFS slush pile...

Subject: [PATCH] move m68k headers
move m68k headers, tell m68knommu to add arch/m68k/include to its
search path and kill the files in arch/m68knommu/include/asm that
become useless after that.
