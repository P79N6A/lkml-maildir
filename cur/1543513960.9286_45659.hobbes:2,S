	Since 4BSD derivatives do not have this semantics it's pointless
- you will get a non-portable code that can be very hard to fix. IOW,
anything that relies on such property is broken by design.

	The same reasoning shows that in 99% of cases you simply will not
need this feature. Playing with permissions semantics (_removing_
restrictions at that) just because someday somebody might want to write
(unspecified) non-portable code... Yuck.
