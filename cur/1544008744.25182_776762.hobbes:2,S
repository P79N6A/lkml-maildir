Ahh. Yes, that's possible. It's quite possible that the problem isn't 
resource allocation per se, but just the bigger complexity at resume time.
This is a hibernate-only issue for you, right? Or is it about regular 
suspend-to-ram too?

Well, how stable has hibernate been on that particular machine 
historically?
Because the half-revert alignment patch (ie reverting part of 5f17cf) that 
made it work for you would actually have been a non-issue in the original 
code that was pre-PCI-resource-alignment cleanup (commit 88452565).
So the patch you partially reverted was literally the one that made the 
Cardbus allocation work the _same_ way as it did historically, before 
88452565. So if the new code breaks for you, then so should the "old" code 
(ie 2.6.25 and earlier).
So the "hasn't been reported before" case may well be just another way of 
saying "hibernate has never been very reliable".
