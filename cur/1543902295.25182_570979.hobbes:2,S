Yeah, fair enough.

Not being able to debug the cases that occur (and the fact that
they're rare, as you're pointing out) is as much of a problem as the
crashes themselves. 8k + IRQ stacks with a warning when 4k of process
stack is exceeded would seem like a reasonable first step to making 4k
a palatable default.
