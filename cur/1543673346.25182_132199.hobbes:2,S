No shit.  Locking, refcounting, serial drivers, yada, yada.  Currently it's
the worst widely-used subsystem in the tree - both 2.4 and 2.5 (and 2.2 is
not much better).  I've got some cleanups, but that will have to go slowly
and carefully - otherwise we'll destroy the last remnants of 2.0 race
prevention logics in there and that's the only thing that makes the current
code kinda-sorta work most of the time.

BTW, somebody will have to document the tty driver and ldisc API.
