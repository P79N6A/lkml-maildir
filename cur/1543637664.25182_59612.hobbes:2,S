It will hurt with benchmarks, because with benchmarks
all of the scheuler is in L1 all the time.
This stuff's hard.  I don't know what the right answer

To optimise for scheduler-intensive workloads we should
optimise for the all-in-cache case.  To optimise for
other workloads we should aim to reduce the cache footprint.
Perhaps.  Dunno.
