I looked up the printed manual (which can be also found at
ftp://ftp.clevo.com.tw/USRMANUAL/D4x0J/D4x0J_CUG.zip
 ), page 9 contains
the following information:
LED Power & Communication Indicators:
Icon | Color            | Description
-----+------------------+-----------------------------------------------
Mail | Blinking Green & | New mail has arrived
LED  | Orange           |
     +------------------+-----------------------------------------------
     | Fast Blinking    | New mail has arrived from users defined
     | Green & Orange   | in the Special Group in the Auto Mail Checker
     +------------------+-----------------------------------------------
     | Green            | The (optional) Wireless LAN module is On
     +------------------+-----------------------------------------------
     | Orange           | The (optional) Bluetooth module is On
     +------------------+-----------------------------------------------
     | Half Orange/     | Both the (optional) Wireless LAN and Bluetooth
     | Half Green       | modules are On (see sidebar)
-----+------------------+-----------------------------------------------
Unfortunately I do not have these optional modules so I never saw the LED
just on without blinking. I don't know if there is any hardware limitation
turning on the LED without the optional modules.
I will send a new patch collection which addresses the other mentioned topics.
