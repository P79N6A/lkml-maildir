netlink_unicast() is only calling skb_clone() because we artificially
increased the refcount on the skb in question. 
As I understand it, we do that in order to prevent the skb from being
lost if netlink_unicast() returns an error -- it normally frees the skb
before returning in that case. Am I alone in thinking that behaviour is
strange?
I'm really not fond of the refcount trick -- I suspect I'd be happier if
we were just to try to keep track of sk_rmem_alloc so we never hit the
condition in netlink_attachskb() which might cause it to fail.
