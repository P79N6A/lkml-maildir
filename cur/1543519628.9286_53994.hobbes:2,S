    I did see a patch _somewhere_ which killed off processes more
intelligently than by a random()-ish method :).  I think it starting killing
off the tasks which were asleep the most, followed by the memory hogs..
    Unfortunately, since I've never have this problem, I never bookmarked the
webpage which had the page :(.  You might want to try searching
www.linuxhq.com, www.kernelnotes.org and www.linuxmama.com for any hint of
'out of memory'.  IIRC, the patch was for 2.2.9+.
    If somebody finds the patch, I'm sure many on the list would appreciate
the URL!
