hello,
i'm sure that this has been asked 1000 times already but i couldn't find
a useful answer yet, so i'm asking here:
where can i find the equivalent to /proc/pid/cpu when running a 2.6 kernel?
if it's gone - is there a patch available to bring it back? i really
need the information for monitoring purposes.
any help is more than welcome,
Thoralf
