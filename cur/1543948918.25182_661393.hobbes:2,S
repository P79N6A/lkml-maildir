An xattr protocol is overkill for conveying a MAC label over the network, 
and would still not provide the required semantics.
Please see prior discussion on this e.g.
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120424789929258&w=2
Note that RAs are already used to convey ACLs and all other system-managed 
metatdata.  i.e. an extensible, appropriate infrastructure already exists 
in the NFSv4 protocol, and has been used successfully for similar 
purposes.  We do not need to add a new, generalized protocol to NFSv4 
for this, especially one which does not meet the requirements.
