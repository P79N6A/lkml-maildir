OK, perhaps I should have been more explicit...
A filesystem is *one kind* of database.
The operations that various databases implement differ -- not all
databases have commit()/rollback(), nor do all of them implement
relationals, object linking, etc.
The point was mostly that storing mail in a (basically) unstructured
flat-file format isn't really consistent with the operations you want to
perform on it.  I didn't mean the directory/file format was necessarily
the ultimate solution, only that (a) it works better than mbox, (b) it's
been around for a long time.
