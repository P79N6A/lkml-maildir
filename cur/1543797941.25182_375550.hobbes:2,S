the cost of a spinlock-based generic_cmpxchg could be significantly 
reduced by adding a generic_cmpxchg() variant that also includes a 
'spinlock pointer' parameter.
Architectures that do not have the instruction, can use the specified 
spinlock to do the cmpxchg. This means that there wont be one single 
global spinlock to emulate cmpxchg, but the mutex's own spinlock can be 
used for it.
Architectures that have the cmpxchg instruction would simply ignore the 
parameter, and would incur no overhead.
