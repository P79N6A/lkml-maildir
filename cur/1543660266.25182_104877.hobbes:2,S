(I've been going through all the <asm-*/*.h> API files, and there is a
lot of duplication, with very small variations.  It was with a view to
getting rid of some of the duplication, and making it easy to see what
the _real_ differences are).
MIPS and Sparc are the only architectures that decided to be really
different to all the other Linux archs).
Anyway, I spotted another MIPS suggestion:
	asm-mips/siginfo.h:
	The comments explain that siginfo_t is IRIX compatible with
	extensions.  In fact it is not IRIX compatible, now that
	siginfo_t._sigchld has an additional _uid field in the middle
	of it.  So it's compatible for _some_ uses only.
	It's obvious that the code author knew of this change (because
	_irix_sigchld is there to document it), but didn't change the
	comment.
Suggestion:
	That comment should be removed or changed as siginfo_t
	is not IRIX compatible, at least in this part.  And maybe
	_irix_sigchld should be removed, along with the comment.
cheers,
