I can buy that too.  It would be a great improvement over instructing
people to grok all one bazillion lines of kernel code to understand
how to tweak an area that might need to be massaged in three places.

Well, now you are at the other end of the spectrum.  I'm not suggesting
we head over that far.  Some popular "high impact" areas could be
provided the finer grained controls and the others could just be
lumped together.  I think there can be a middle ground that's
beneficial.

True, but there are a number of people out there who want to do say
a kernel port to XYZ custom board.  They learn some basic kernel
knowledge, but we can't expect them to be a guru of everything to
get some work done.
One thing that happens with even a little more flexibility is that
the amount of traffic about tweaking things go down a bit.  Not a
"sizing" type tweak, but I often get questions about optimizing
kernel VM space on high-end PPC systems. We put in some options
so that TASK_SIZE, PAGE_OFFSET, and PKMAP_BASE can be easily
tweaked...now it's easy to tell somebody where to look to make
a change.  Before that, it was necessary to explain both places
that mod needed to be made to move KERNELBASE to a smarter value.
Now, one thing I consider at this point is that if we do think
about even a *little* more fine-grained settings, config options
may not be the place to collect them.  We could just have a common
include to catch all these things.  That would hide it away from
the "dumb users" a bit and even provide a basis for a mechanism
to have some different system "profiles" perhaps.  CONFIG_TINY,
CONFIG_DESKTOP, CONFIG_SERVER..who knows.
