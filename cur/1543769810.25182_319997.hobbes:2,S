If you can't trust what the kernel is outputting in /proc, you're screwed.
And for that matter, how would you verify that it's the TPM that signed the
externally generated nonce? (Remember - if you can't trust /proc, then you
have to assume that *any* attempt at talking to the TPM from userspace *is*
a MITM attack - and you don't have access to any out-of-band info.  If the
now-untrusted kernel did a MITM on your nonce and signed it with a fake key,
then it can *also* MITM your attempt to read the "correct" key from /etc/tpm.key
or wherever it is....
