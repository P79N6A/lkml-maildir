    Hi all :)
    I'm going to build a new glibc for my system, and I've installed
'linux-libc-headers', but I've noticed that it provides headers for
'scsi/' subdir, and glibc *does that too*. Should I use the scsi
headers from llh? Should I instead compiled my new glibc without that
headers and let it install them as needed? Should I NOT use any linux
header for building my new glibc (2.3.4 BTW)?
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
