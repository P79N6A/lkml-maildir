Well, I basically thought the combination of my recent 4GB harddisk + the old 
IDE hardware causes troubles.
But you're right, it can be anything else - but there is nothing special about 
this old laptop - moreover the error occured in both models. So I just 
guessed that there could be an IDE hardware flaw which is not uncommon with 
old hardware.
But, what else could it be? The console driver? UNIX 98 PTY? Perhaps the math 
emulation (486SL has no coprocessor) makes troubles?
I'm absolutely clueless...
