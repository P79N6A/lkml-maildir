Well there are very great problems with a lot of drivers if you
want good latency, but are sharing interrupts. Many drivers poll
in the ISR! This means that they loop through their ISR code
in some "interrupt mitigation scheme" that some near-do-well taught
in web-page school. This means, that if you share an interrupt,
you are probably screwed. You need to put your board in some slot
where it will either be first on the IRQ chain, or not shared at
all. Typical latencies are around 1.2 microseconds on a 400 MHz
machine, better on faster, sometimes better with two CPUs and an
IOAPIC.
