It fails to create a slab. There should be some of message above what I 
can see that would indicate what went wrong.
Please try to reboot and specify "slub_debug" as a kernel parameter. If it 
boots then send us the kernel log output. Must have something to do with 
how the scsi slab is created in scsi_setup_command_freelist.
