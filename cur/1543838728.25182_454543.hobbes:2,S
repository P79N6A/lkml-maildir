Hi Sam,
I was told that the removing of UTS_RELEASE in include/linux/version.h is permanent. I use it in my configuration script to get the version numbers of different kernel build sources.  Greg k-h told me to ask you about how to properly get the kernel source version.  Do you have any suggestions?  Please don't forget to cc me directly since I am not in the mailing list.
Thanks,
Ping
