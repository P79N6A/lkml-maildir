I ran 2.6.21-rt10 + this patch with kernbench and then loops building a kernel 
(which would previously rapidly exhaust memory).  It successfully built 400 
kernels with "make -j 32" on an 8 opteron machine with 8 GB of RAM and has so 
far completed 25 "make -j" on the same system.  Looks like a winner to me so 
far.
