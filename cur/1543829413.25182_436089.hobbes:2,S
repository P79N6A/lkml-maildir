ok, i've improved the comment in trace_irqflags.h.

seems like the most practical place for it. Previously we had no central 
include file for irq-flags APIs (they used to be included from 
asm/system.h and other random per-arch places) - trace_irqflags.h has 
become the central file now. Should i rename it to irqflags.h perhaps, 
to not tie it to tracing? We have some deprecated irq-flags ops in 
interrupt.h, maybe this all belongs there. (although i think it's 
cleaner to have linux/include/irqflags.h and include it from 
interrupt.h)
