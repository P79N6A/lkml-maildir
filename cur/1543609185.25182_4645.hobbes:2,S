   Well on my setup, there are more hash buckets than there are
   pages in the system.  So - basically empty.  If memory serves
   me, never more than two pages in a bucket.
Ok, this is what I expected.  The function is tuned for
having N_HASH_CHAINS being roughly equal to N_PAGES.
If you want to experiment with smaller hash tables, there
are some hacks in the FreeBSD sources that choose a different "salt"
per inode.  You xor the salt into the hash for each page on that
inode.  Something like this...
Franks a lot,
