Yeah, I suppose I agree, though I dislike removing it en masse for some 
reason.  No real technical reason, more just gut feeling...  The PC9800 
people spent a good long while working with Alan and others to get what 
little bits got merged into the kernel.
I suppose disappearing and not maintaining the code is the overriding 
factor here...
