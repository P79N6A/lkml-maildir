Well: when someone does big changes to kernel (like turning way
wait-queues are declared), he/she tends to fix all places in linux
kernel. He/she certainly will break few drivers. Problem with pcmcia
drivers is that all of them are allways broken this little way. Is
pcmcia package distributed in form of patches?

mj@ucw.cz + jj@ucw.cz want to do complete rewrite of buses for 2.3,
and one of their goals is make dynamically configured devices
available.

Currently, PCMCIA is licensed using MPL. Would it be possible to
release pcmcia package under _both_ MPL and GPL in future to make
in-kernel integration easier? [pretty please] [I'm not a lawyer so I
do not know if it would be legal to integrate MPL sources into kernel
tree. And I do not think Linus would like MPL sources in kernel
tree...]
