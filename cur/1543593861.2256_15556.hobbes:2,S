It looks good, but it's black magic - it could use a comment along the lines 
of:
/*
 * Ensure at least one pass through all three lists with lock held
 */
There is some fuzz on the original code that could use a scrubbing.  "start" 
should not be the 1st full page needing truncating, it should be the first 
page needing truncating at all, full or partial.
The truncation condition becomes:
-		if ((offset >= start) || (*partial && (offset + 1) == start)) {
+		if (offset >= start) {
[...]
-			if (*partial && (offset + 1) == start)
+			if (*partial && offset == start)
Then the conditions are so easy to test it's not worth passing the &partial, 
just pass lstart... and... oh bother, it's not broke, why fix it ;-)
