s/zone/node/ then yes (zone == node if we just have a single zone).

The L1/L2 cpu cache or the pageset hot / cold caches? Take N pages 
from a node instead of 1? That would mean we need to have more complex 
interleaving logic that keeps track of how many pages we took. The number 
of pages to take will vary depending on the size of the shared data. For 
shared data areas that are just a couple of pages this wont work.

Not if we have a set of remaining nodes.
