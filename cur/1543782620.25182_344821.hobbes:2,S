The problem seems (IMO) to be in userspace, your software seems to be doing
too much stuff for no good reason. If grep calls mremap() too many times
that's their problem; and even if it's doing that, the kernel is doing the
mremap() stuff quite fast

Maybe a bug in the regexp code in your /bin/grep? Are you using
different distro/versions in your two boxes?
