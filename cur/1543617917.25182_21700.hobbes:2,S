Kent,
We had this on olympic for certain high end IBM boxen. Spent forever
trying to trap it as I couldn't emulate the behaviour on my test
boxes. We weren't getting correct values from pci reads/write and we
were running out of buffers as they weren't getting flushed. The
machine wouldn't lock but the adapter would stop tx/rx.
Turned out the pci bridge on the machine itself was causing the
problems. Tweaking the pci bus fixed the problem.
