I've been chasing several M/O disk problem reports and they appear to
indicate some drives do not report a media change if asked in the situation
where they have previously reported errors indicating that no media is
present or that the media is not ready.
Can a suitable scsi magician tell me if that is correct behaviour or not.
(Either way it wants fixing but I want to know if it should complain about
 the drive or not)
