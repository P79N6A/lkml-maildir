This would be OK.  It would not be hard to fix pxa2xx_spi, for example,
to reject zero-length transfers in DMA mode, as long as it is acceptable
to reject the message in mid-message.  If it were necessary to scan a
whole message for zero-length transfers and refuse to queue an offending
message, then that adds burden to all messages.
