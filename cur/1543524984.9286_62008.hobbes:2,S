A simple make modules for them would have told you the problem ones.

Does it belong in the tty layer when it appears relevant purely to physical
port hardware ? (Just curious)
Also btw, post 2.4 can we have a rule that anyone who submits a new different
Z8530 chipset driver gets told to write a generic one. Especially since we
even now have different includes with different names for the same register.
It puts the lance drivers in the shade 8)
