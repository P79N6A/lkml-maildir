Yes, of course that was my first idea, too. And this was my motivation for
sending you the cut down patch without the > 25 MHz entries. But I'm almost
prepared to bet this is not the root of the evil.
As I said, this does not explain why the resolution seems to switch to 800x640,
because lx_set_clock() does not return any feedback. I somehow doubt you'll get
a white screen just by raising the dotclock by 2 % (and getting it _closer_ to
the intended value)?
And before I wrote my mail yesterday, I checked the dotclock for the 0x00004286
and 0x00014170 PLL values with a scope, and both settings produced a fine signal
with the expected frequencies.
Anyway, I hope I'm wrong, then at least we'd have a solution for this issue.

Took the original table from lxfb_ops.c, everywhere set DIV4 and divided
frequency by 4, merged it back into the original table, dropping all lines
within 300 kHz of an preexisting setting.
I wrote a small script to do this, to avoid typos when mangling the table
(assuming the original table was ok).

LX Data Book, p. 554:
"DIV4: Divide by 4. When set, the PLL output is divided by 4 before clocking the
logic."
Sounds like a simple divider circuit _behind_ the PLL, so as long as the
original frequency is ok, the DIV4-ed should be, too.
As I said, I assumed the original table in lxfb_ops.c to contain usable values.
And all of the few settings I checked with the scope looked ok.

So in case the increased dotclock in fact causes the white screen, it might be
cleaner to lower the _requested_ dotclock in the OLPC DCON mode timing to 56.250
MHz instead of cutting out PLL settings.

Well, in my opinion it would be nice to have some intermediate steps in the
available dotclocks. However, I don't actually need those for the 320x240 panel,
so I don't care much.
