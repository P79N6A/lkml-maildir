The next time I'm using that system for large I/O I will try and do so.
But the shortcomings seem rather obvious already (more below).

But there is!  If it is not in-memory, then it needs IRQs to be paged-in
before it can redistribute any IRQs.  And when the situation is bad,
the page-in device is one that can be suffering from poor response.
Which just makes the system stutter even more.

You are more expert on that aspect than I am.
But surely networking can be taken into account when
distributing other IRQs dynamically ?

I think perhaps the existing algorithm makes the assumptions of
a static configuration of IRQ generating devices, and an unchanging
IRQ average frequency among them.
Neither assumption is valid in a hotplug environment, and the second
assumption is certainly not true on most of my machines.
The lone 64-bit desktop configuration I have here is the only one without
in-kernel IRQ distribution, and it has the fastest (2.5GHz) clock speed,
the largest number (4) of CPU cores, and the most memory (4GB)
of any of the machines here.
And yet it really felt "jerky" in use when copying data around last night,
even after installing/running the userspace irqbalance daemon.
I eventually just moved the work over to a slower machine with a 32-bit
kernel (notebook, 2.1GHz, two cores, 3GB), and things finished more rapidly
and with no noticeable mal effects on the GUI at the time.
The workload in all cases here was plugging in 2GB USB sticks,
and copying a 2GB image to them, and the unplugging/replugging them
and running md5sum to verify correct data transfers.
I had a lot of them (14) to do, and so generally two or three sticks
were plugged in and in use at any given time.
A last note on the quad-core, is that irqbalance *never* used
more than two cores.  Dunno why not.
Cheers
