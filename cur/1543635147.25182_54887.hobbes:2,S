I reported the same behaviour when the "input" stuff
was in Dave Jones's tree: the wheel on my "logitech"
PS/2 mouse now scrolls panes the wrong way (or at
least the opposite way to 2.5.24 and windows).
Here are the mouse related lines from /var/log/messages :
Jul  7 09:56:25 frig kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
....
Jul  7 09:56:25 frig kernel: input: ImPS/2 Microsoft IntelliMouse on isa0060/serio1  
Jul  7 09:56:25 frig kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
