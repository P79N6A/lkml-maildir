The problem I have with most visionaries is that while 
they see lots of stuff, they never show anything to the
rest of the world.
Unless you can explain to other people why your idea
makes sense, or unless you implement your idea, it won't
happen.
If the idea is good enough, either of explanation or
implementation should be enough.
Preaching, OTOH, does not convince people.
