It is not about attackers. It is about normal usage. If you spawn a program,
it might behave wrong since it does not know that it is priveledged. For
example a network daemon might start a child process which interacts with
the user, and forgets to drop priveldges for it.

Yes, however I thought this was exactly what the patch is not doing?
