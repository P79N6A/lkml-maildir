To do pathname-based access control in any way, the LSM must be able to
obtain the pathname of an accessed object. The discussion should be
about the best way for an LSM to obtain the pathname of an object being
accessed.
To find the pathname of the object, LSM needs the VFS mount point data.
The VFS owns this information, so the question is the best way to convey
it from VFS to relevant LSM hooks. We are agnostic about how to get that
mount point data, but AFAICT saying that LSM can't see the mount point
data at all is equivalent to rejecting pathname based access control
entirely.

The reverse path construction has been criticized for being both broken
and counter-intuitive. Our secure d_path patch fixes the "broken" part,
it now securely reconstructs the path. The counter-intuitive is because
forward construction of the pathname has unexpected costs, making the
retroactive construction more attractive.

John Johansen posted a patch (written by Andreas Gruenbacher) that
introduced a nameidata2 data structure to try to solve the conditional
null passing problem, but it received no comment. A proper fix to this
problem is clearly desirable, but it also is clearly a defect in NFS and
fixing it is a lot of work; why does AA have to stay outside the kernel
until NFS is fixed, when it can easily adapt to the problem until it is
fixed properly?

I think it is a little more fundamental than that. If you are going to
do pathname based access control at all, you need access to sufficient
information to compute the path name. Can we have a discussion about the
best way to do that?
