Their idea is simple:
a) Starting on an empty directory do a readdir() on it and makes symlinks on 
   every entry to the real file
b) If open regular file is made the symlink is removed and replaced with the 
   whole file. If the file already exists just use cached copy. No consistency
   check are done over the original and cached files.
c) If opendir is requested, directory is created in the cache and cachefs 
   daemon performs a) on the newly created directory
d) Only cache copies are performed on directories and regular files. Symlinks
   sockets, special files and so are redirected to the real file
e) when cache space is next to go out, cachefs daemon performs an unlink of
   files cached ( not directories ) using a First-in-Fisrt-out algorithm. This
   is the major problem: the entire cachefs is stopped during the cleanning 
   process ( what about a cache clean thread... a really big error )
f) Access, creation, and modification times are not consistent between cached
   and original files. Lack of lock control, so we must ensure that original
   files won't change and are mounted readonly (just as /usr or /opt directory)
Seems not to be very difficult patch the provided patch and create a GPL'd 
source available cachefs daemon.... but not sure if the limitations on this
package make it good for starting job
	Ideas?
