I ACK this patch, as mentioned earlier, but the description and sign-off 
leave something to be desired.
Would you rather resend this patch without all the commentary, so that 
it may be automatically snarfed, or just resend a proper description and 
sign-off?
Note that (as stated in Documentation/SubmittingPatches) the standard 
way to include commentary is to include it after the patch description 
and "---" separator.  Anything after "---" is automatically snipped.
This applies to patches sent to Linus, me, and anyone else who uses git 
to import patches.  (as well as being the patch format standard)
