Ok, fine.
Now I'm working on socket code.
We still have a question about implicit vs explicit function parameters.
This question becomes more important for sockets: if we want to allow to use
sockets belonging to namespaces other than the current one, we need to do
something about it.
One possible option to resolve this question is to show 2 relatively short
patches just introducing namespaces for sockets in 2 ways: with explicit
function parameters and using implicit current context.
Then people can compare them and vote.
Do you think it's worth the effort?

I found your comments, thank you!

I'll split the patch.

What helper functions are you referring to?
