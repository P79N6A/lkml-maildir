I have not had a problem, no errors at all, since I rebooted to 
2.6.24-rc8 with the added argument in the kernel line in grub 
(from dmesg):
[    0.000000] Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 acpi_use_timer_override rhgb quiet
which causes dmesg to log, some time later:
[   27.581823] ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
[   27.582014] ..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
[   27.592017] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[   27.592068] ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...  failed.
[   27.592071] ...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... works.
[   27.703623] Brought up 1 CPUs
This was about noonish yesterday, and the logs have been silent 
regarding this 'exception Emask' error since then.  The drive itself
has also passed a smartctl -t long test with no errors since then.
Now, the last boot that had the problem was to 2.6.24, which did 
NOT have that 'acpi_use_timer_override' argument, and its dmesg logged:
[   24.934176] ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
[   24.934367] ..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=0 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
[   25.045973] Brought up 1 CPUs
Now, my question is, did the use of that argument, while it looked
like it failed, cause the setup code to do something correct that
the default path didn't do?  Is this the clue we're all looking for?
Since libata is apparently the path taken by TPTB, I'm going to build
and boot to a 2.6.24 using libata, but add that argument to grubs kernel
line in only one of 2 copies of that stanza.
Wish me luck.
