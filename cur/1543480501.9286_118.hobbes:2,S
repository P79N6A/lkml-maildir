How about this, from Halloween III, the Microsoft official statement regarding
Halloween I and II:
Microsoft Netherlands' spokesperson Aurelia van den Berg stated in a memo 
concerning the Linux kernel development method,
  "Linux is a philosophy as much as technical phenomena. On the positive, and
  Microsoft is interested in better understanding and finding ways to
  accommodate this dynamic, it provides for extensive peer review, and for a
  lot of independent parallel work on a variety of features."

Ok, how about "Linux runs on personal computers such as modern Pentium II
and Power Macintosh systems, makes efficient use of older 80386-powered
computers, and is also available for Sun UltraSparc-powered workstations and
a variety of other system architectures."
