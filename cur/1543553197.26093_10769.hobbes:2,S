Code reuse.  You may not need every single thing that the kvmap api
gives you --- for example, you may not need the per-mmap refcounting,
because you might be associating your dma buffer with the file
descriptor, not the mmap region --- but if you implement the same
nopage code in every single sound driver, then you end up with a lot
of duplication and you increase (enormously) the number of places you
have to touch if anything ever changes in the vma management code.
Cheers,
 Stephen
