But that should be trivial: that's what the per-inode vfsmount list was 
(your first question in the last email).

And again - I talked about this in the previous email. Even if you anchor 
the list in "struct inode", or you do it with a totally external 
hash-list, you'll always have the "vfsmount->mnt_mountpoint" pointer to 
point to the dentry. So you can just iterate over the list, and 
cherry-pick the ones that point to the dentry you are removing.

No, lookup would just return the dentry, but the dentry would already be 
filled in with the mount-point information.
And you can do that with a simple vfs helper function, ie the filesystem 
itself would just need to do
	pseudo_mount(dentry, inode);
thing - which just fills in dentry->d_mountpoint with a new vfsmount
thing. It would allocate a new root dentry (for the pseudo-mount) and a
new vfsmount, and make dentry->d_mountpoint point to it.
IOW, the filesystem itself would never mess around with d_mountpoint 
itself.

Hmm.. We might as well allow it, I suspect. It's not like it should hurt.  
We'd end up following the mount-chain twice, but we already have that
issue with multi-mount cases..
