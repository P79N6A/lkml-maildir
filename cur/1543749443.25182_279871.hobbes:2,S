Thanks for having explained this. Up to now, after several series of find or
other FS-intensive tasks, I often launched a simple home-made program to which
I tell how much memory I want it to allocate (and touch), then it exits freeing
this amount of memory. A bit dangerous but really effective indeed !
I too will try to play with vm_vfs_scan_ratio, it seems appealing.
Cheers,
Willy
