We defintively need to go through the filesystem for I/O submission,
and also for I/O completion.  Thinking of the async submission might be
what Peter actually implemented for his network swapping patches as
you really wouldn't want to write it out synchronously.
Peter, any chance you could chime in here?

IMHO this shouldn't be done in the loop driver anyway.  Filesystems have
their own effricient extent lookup trees (well, at least xfs and btrfs
do), and we should leverage that instead of reinventing it.
