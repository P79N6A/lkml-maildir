Not to be fecicious, you can reboot.
But if this is not good enough, you can try this:
swapoff -a
swapon -a
This may take a while if your system is busy and a lot of RAM has been used.
It especially will take a long time if your system was dipping into swap because an active process really needed that extra ram.
You can kill off as many memory hungry processes as possible first, to try and do this as painlessly as possible.
My thought is this: if she wants swap, give her swap! It beats a diamond ring.
