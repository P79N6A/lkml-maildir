This is the same thing I said to Paul Rolland, since I think your
problems are the same:
I had this problem as well. It has to do with mac80211, cfg80211 and
the rate control algorithm not initializing early enough in the boot
process. These two patches should fix it:
[PATCH] mac80211: fix initialisation when built-in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/5710/match=patch
+mac80211+initialisation
[PATCH] cfg80211: fix initialisation if built-in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/71326/match=patch
+cfg80211+initialisation
Regards,
Rob
