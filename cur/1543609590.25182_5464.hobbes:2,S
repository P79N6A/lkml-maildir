Sorry Jonathan, but this is even more broken than the last patch. In
different ways. In no particular order:
o You are duplicating way too much code and exporting block internals
o You are breaking SCSI merge completely, why on earth are you suddenly
  using ll_*_merge functions for SCSI?!
o scsi_make_request need not worry about head active
o scsi_make_request can safe the q->*_merge indirect
o scsi_dispatch_cmd() io_request_lock removal looks racy
At least you are not breaking anything other than SCSI this time...
