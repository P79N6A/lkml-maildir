Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Cleanup code to replace DPRINTK with pr_debug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/8/533

This patch series replaces DPRINTK with pr_debug in alternative.c,
autofs, autofs4
and ncpfs. A new function called pr_err is also added to keep
functionality in
ncpfs. The last 2 patches add support for pr_debug_pid and apply it to
autofs4 to
keep the output the same as the current DPRINTK statements.
All patches have been compile tested but not boot tested
