    	if (PageWriteback(page))
    		BUG();
   -	ClearPageDirty(page);
   -	page->flags &= ~(1<<PG_referenced);
   +
   +	page->flags &= ~((1UL << PG_referenced) | (1UL << PG_dirty));
Umm, nevermind.  Look at ClearPageDirty, it does
"other stuff" so you can't remove it wholesale.
In the end, the code is as it should be right now.
