Subject: [PATCH 0/10] "Bigger" UML fixes for 2.6.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a collection of more intrusive UML fixes for 2.6.14.
However, I've been careful in them (at least so I hope). You may want to put 
some in -mm, but please let's make sure that they get into -mm.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
