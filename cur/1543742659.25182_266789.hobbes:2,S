OK, I am seeing the exact same results.  They are so close to yours that
I am not going to bother posting them.  UI activity does seem to trigger
missed IRQs - if I switch to my mail window or Mozilla and back to the
test I see that 4 or 5 IRQs in a row got skipped.  So maybe context
switching triggers the bug.
