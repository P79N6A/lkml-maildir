Yes, by fixing the file systems or by implementing safe user mounts. It will
be something like fuse, maybe it will be fuse using a userspace version
of a kernel thread. Maybe not.

It's global, and it can be done remotely. Therefore you can either have
remote logins or a secure console.
The correct fix would be binding the keymap to the current tty only,
resetting the console if it gets closed and not allowing init to reuse
it unless it's closed. If you do this, you'll want a default setting, too.
YANI: Root should be able to set a coloured border indicating that it's
really the getty/login process asking for the user prompt/password.
