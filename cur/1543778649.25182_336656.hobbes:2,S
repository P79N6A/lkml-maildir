add_watch and rm_watch both do, because system call arguments are
zero-extended by default for compat tasks, thus the "fd" arg needs
sign extension.
You'll notice that sys_ppc32.c has a ton of shims which purely
exist to sign extend "int" system call arguments.  Sparc64 does
something similarly, but in assembler so that we don't eat the
overhead of a full stack frame just to sign extend arguments.
