No, they are written out by swap_writepage.   The opening in sys_swapon
gets a handle of what is to be used for swap, but it then goes its own way.

Caches of swapfile are useful (but yes, can be discarded when memory
is tight).  There's nothing indirect about them: the page that is mapped
into userspace gets written to disk, the page that is read in from disk
gets mapped back into userspace.
