I have reinstalled SuSE now, and I apologise as I was only partially
correct. I do get errors, but they are slightly different from RH. They
appear to be saying the same thing, though. Every 30 seconds I get:
Aug 11 10:37:06 terra kernel: Northbridge status 9405c00000000a13

These suggest it's just reporting ECC corrections. Why would it do this
exactly every 30 seconds? (or is that just the reporting interval?)
