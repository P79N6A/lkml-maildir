I was told you could answer my question. Do you know why my computer would
be rebooting on the setup when it is at the point of "calibrating the
delay loop?"
My computer has:
Intel mother board
Intel chip (200MMX)
6.4 gig western digital hard drive. (completely formatted)
ATI video card
CyberDrive CD-ROM
Sound Blaster 16
Does certain version of CMOS not work with Redhat 5.1, I don't have my
version handy, but can get it later if needed. I have tried RH5.1,
a version of Slackware to no avail. I plan on trying RH5.2 tonight just
for kicks, but I'm guessing it will not help.
I am not on the distribution list, so if you could please reply
to me directly: seeman10@cns.uni.edu
I thank you for you time, and hope you can help.
