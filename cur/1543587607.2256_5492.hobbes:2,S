According to a couple other people this problem may only occur on this 
motherboard.

When these errors occur, I never get to a shell prompt.  Is there a way 
to save the errors or have them saved somewhere so I don't have to write 
all that stuff down?  Also, how can I set the console buffer (what is it 
called, where you can view previous screens with SHIFT + PgUP/DOWN?) to 
hold more so I don't lose some of the errors?
Thanks,
Moses
