Because people use it to tell objects apart. All over the kernel we do
things like
	if (inode1 == inode2)
to figure out if they are the same inode. Now inodes are not zero sized
so we are safe there

Its the usual semantic in languages that use a pointer as an object
handle. C is actually the oddity here, the other languages use it to
avoid aliasing of object handles and the resulting confusion.
Clearly we do need an option to make the kernel explode when misusing
such pointers for debugging whatever the default for other behaviour is.
And on a 64bit box we probably have enough address space to hand out a
few million unique faulting pointers.
