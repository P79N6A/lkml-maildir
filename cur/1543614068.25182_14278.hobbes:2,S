Subject: CD-ROM read problem introdruced in 2.4.x and 2.5.x ?

I tried this on 2 different systems:
1. Pentium 2/ Intel 440LX / SCSI System with 
	Plextor PX32TS and Yamaha CDR400t on aic7880
2. Athlon 1500XP / Via KT266A (vt8233) / IDE System  with 
	Plextor 24/10/40A (DMA off :-( ) and LiteOn DVD-ROM LTD163
A CD-R with mp3 songs (Maxell 74 min. 6x blue writing side):
It reads and plays well on all 4 drives of the 2 machines under kernel 2.2.18 
and 2.2.19 as well as under Windows.
It cannot be read and played under:
2.4.0		(both machines)
2.4.10		(both machines)
2.4.15		(ide, scsi not tested)
2.4.16		(both machines)
2.5.1-pre9	(ide, scsi not tested)
The errors occur always in the same regions of the disk with slight 
differences between drives so it probably has errors but they seem to be 
handled less tolerantly.
Related?: While copying from a CD under the 2.4 kernels the system load on 
the IDE machine goes up to 75 percent even for the LiteOn drive with DMA on, 
while on 2.2.19 it never exceeds 10% even for the Plextor with DMA off and it 
is slightly faster.

Sorry for this long post. I know it is quite general but if there is any 
further useful information I can supply.
Kind regards
