The main problem is that we would need a "vmalloc reserve first; allocate pages
later" interface. On x86 it would be easy by just splitting up vmalloc/vmap a bit
again. Does anybody else see problems with implementing that on any
other architecture? 
This wouldn't be truly demand paged, just pages initialized on allocation.
