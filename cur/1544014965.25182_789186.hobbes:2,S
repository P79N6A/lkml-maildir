After quick look,
it seems that css_set->subsys==empty case cannot be handled and need much
changes. Maintaining hierarchy tree itself seems difficult.
I think cgroup is being stable day by day. So, I don't like to crash it
by big hummer for this tiny feature.
How about adding "none" subsys  ? (I'd like to set default=y ;)
As Paul said, "Show multiple hierarchy view for each mount point"
seems attractive but it's not very fundametal, IMHO.
If we can increase subsys_id dynamically or subsys can have
multiple root node, the situation will change.
