 I may be mistaken, but the lirc_atiusb module looks redondant with
the driver already in drivers/usb/input/ati_remote.c.
Moreover, I was under the impression that the input layer was
currently considered the "right way" to implement the kernel side lirc
needs (AFAICT the lircd daemon is already able to handle events from
the input layer).
So I'm wondering : in view of a kernel merge, wouldn't it be better
for the lirc drivers to be ported to the input layer (linux-input ML
in cc:) ?
Regards,
Vincent
