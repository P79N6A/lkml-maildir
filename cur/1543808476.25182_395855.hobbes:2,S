On some 64-bit arches (e.g. x86_64), most userspace code is 64-bit,
while on others (e.g. powerpc), most is 32-bit.  Reducing the number of
things that a userspace tool or library writer can trip over seems like
a good thing here, even if it slightly complicates perfmon's internals.

It's pretty normal to just use 64-bit quantities in these cases, and
cast appropriately.
