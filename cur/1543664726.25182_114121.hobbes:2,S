Hi Linus,
some s390 stuff for 2.5.63.
Short descriptions:
1) Basic bug fixes for s390.
2) Add support for system call numbers > 255. The svc instruction
  provides 8 bits for the svc number. The additional system calls for
  the posix timers pushed s390 over the edge of 256 system calls. To
  support more than 256 system calls a second interface is introduced.
  svc 0 is unused so far and will be used like the int 0x80 interface
  on i386. The register %r1 contains the real system call number.
  The new interface requires on additional instructions, e.g. getpid
  with the new interface is "lhi %r1,20; svc 0" compared to the old
  interface "svc 20". The old interface will be used for system call
  number < 256 and the new one for calls >= 256.
3) dasd driver update. A race condition in dasd_end_request and a
  compile fix for devfs.
4) shutdown/restart fixes for the lcs driver.
5) Fix some kmallocs with GFP_DMA but without GFP_KERNEL.
blue skies,
  Martin.
