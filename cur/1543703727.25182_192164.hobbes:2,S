So a user who will only Run this kernel on a PIII for example, doesn't
need to select *any* other kernels at all?  I think the Kconfig help
screens need to be redone to make this clear.
I enabled all the sub-processors because I wanted to make sure my
kernel would boot no matter what.  It seems like I don't need that any
more, right?
