No. The physical addresses do not change due to a soft page fault.
A soft fault means that the page table entry is cleared, but that the 
physical page is still in the system memory. do_swap_page does a swap 
cache lookup and finds the original physical page in memory and maps it 
back to the virtual address. The physical page can't be dropped from the 
swap cache because your driver still holds one reference to the page - 
no swapout.
But fork() is a problem for get_user_pages(): You probably have to write 
an improved function (create_user_mapping/destroy_user_mapping) that 
handles fork correctly.
And add arch hooks into the new function - they are required for archs 
with incoherent cpu caches. Right now O_DIRECT doesn't flush the cpu 
caches, because it's impossible to implement it with get_user_pages(). 
It works, because the data cache is usually coherent and noone loads 
libraries with O_DIRECT.
