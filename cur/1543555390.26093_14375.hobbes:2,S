LKCD won't go into 2.4 (or 2.5) until I finish writing the direct
disk open/write functions that avoid going through the standard
IDE and SCSI drivers.  I'm working on it.
As far as work for 2.4 goes, we've got a version on SourceForge that
works well (for i386 and 95% for ia64).
As soon as the drivers are done, we'll hopefully get acceptance.

P.S.  Any way we can standardize 'make install' in the kernel?  It's
      disturbing to have different install mechanisms per platform ...
      I can make the changes for a few platforms.
