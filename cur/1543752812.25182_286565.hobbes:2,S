All,
I am experiencing issues with connecting two network adapters to the same
subnet, eg.
eth0 192.168.100.200
eth1 192.168.100.201
The task is to have redundant connections to two different hubs. In case one
link goes down the connection should go through the other. The driver
handles link events with netif_carrier_ok and netif_carrier_on from
linux/netdevice.h. These eventually send messages to networking stack with
netdev_change_state from net/core/dev.c
My question is:  Does the kernel handle  the interface state/routing tables
modifications due to link changing automatically or is there some external
daemon required to do that. Any links are greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Jyri Põldre.
