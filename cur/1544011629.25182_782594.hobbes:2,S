We can use xchg. The waiter is protected against the RUNNING_MUTEX
state change via the mutex->lock. It's just some overcautioness when I
started to fix this.

The mechanisms should be the same for everything now.

Duh, yes. So this should be:
     rt_restore_current_state(!mtx ? saved_state : TASK_RUNNING);

Good point.
