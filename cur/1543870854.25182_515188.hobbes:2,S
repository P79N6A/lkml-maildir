At what point does it stop working?
I am not asking this to be difficult, I just want to get Linux
a VM that does not need to be kludged up every time a distro
ships it to its customers.
I believe one starting point would be a concept that people
cannot shoot holes in any more.  That is no guarantee, but
as long as the concept has known holes coding it up is likely
to be a waste of time since the code will need kludges to
deal with the problems later on and we'd be back to square
one.
