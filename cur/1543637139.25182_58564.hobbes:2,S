I cannot reproduce your problem,  behaviour and code seem correct to
me.
I am suspicious of the "map_daemon" option.
This is not valid for the Kernel NFS server and would not be accepted
by the nfs-utils package.
Are you perhaps using the user-space nfs server (some times called
"nfs-server")?
If so, you should know that:
  The behaviour of the user-space nfs server would not be affect
    (greatly) by the kernel version that you are running
  That server is completely unsupported (as far as I know).
If you are using the  kernel based server, please show me:
  cat /etc/exports
  cat /proc/fs/nfs/exports
and I will try harder to reproduce the problem.
