You have to have a version of mac80211 which is current with the version
of rt2x00 2.0.14.  If you don't want to go back into wireless-2.6 git to
do that I can send you my known working copy (for rt73 and I hope for
rt61) of compat-wireless-2.6 which will compile under 2.6.24.  However
it is just over 1MB in size so I won't sent it to you unless you would
like me to do that instead of you pulling git from wireless-2.6 for mid
January (actually the most recent working version would be immediately
before the patch which raised the version of rt2x00 to 2.1.0).
