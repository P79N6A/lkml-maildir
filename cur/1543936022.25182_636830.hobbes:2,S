ENTRY/ENDPROC have nothing to do with dwarf2. That is CFI_STARTPROC/ENDPROC.
But actually checking the default implementation in linkage.h already
implements size:
#ifndef END
#define END(name) \
  .size name, .-name
#endif
#ifndef ENDPROC
#define ENDPROC(name) \
  .type name, @function; \
  END(name)
#endif
Are you sure it doesn't work?  Your patch should be not needed. If it's
still wrong then just ENDPROCs() need to be added.
