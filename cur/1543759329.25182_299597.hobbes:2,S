Heh, it will have to be done by hand for a while, as I don't think any
of us want to write a kernel-patch-managemement-system in our spare
time.  Although, I do know that osdl's PLM at one time was planned to be
such a tool, I'll go kick the developers over there to see what they
say...

Fair enough, I'll stick with 2.6.x.y, as I think it's a good
representation of what people expect.  If people start objecting, I'm
always open for change.
