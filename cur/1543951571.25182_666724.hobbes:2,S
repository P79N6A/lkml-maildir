Quite frankly, there have historically been too many people who just added 
"must_check" to their function prototypes because they thought they were 
oh-so-important. Which means that at least _I_ tend to just ignore them 
(and have asked people to remove some when they get too annoying).
So I'm not at all surprised that people tune them out. They have become 
debased by being overused.
