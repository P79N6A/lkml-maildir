Consider:
static int __init foo()
{
	// ...
}
static int bar()
{
	// ...
	if (foo())
		// ...
}
gcc will often inline foo into bar - and then all code are suddenly
part of .text and no section mismatch.
But you add anohter call to foo() somewhere so gcc decide no longer
to inline foo() and we then have a reference from .text to .init.text.

This is more the -ffunction-section issue I guess.
What we are dealig with here is ~20 more sections and the kernel has
~100 section today (or more). So not a huge increase.
