It has remaining problems that need to be addressed, yes.

Yeah.  I'm hoping someone who knows more about signals than I do would
be excited about looking into the best way to fix this.  I'm sure I
could plod through it in time, but, bleh.  SIGXFSZ is the one in the
back of my mind.

Yeah.  I wanted to experiment with this in the fs/aio.c syslet
management code.  The most obvious fix is to just tear down all the
waiting threads before each operation.  We have to have a worst case to
measure :).  More incentive to get thread creation and destruction even
cheaper might not be such a bad thing, too.
One can imagine all sorts of crazy schemes which let us only shoot down
waiting async threads which were cloned before state in the submitting
task_struct was changed.  Maybe we could swallow increasing a counter in
task_struct each time we change one of these sensitive fields (fsuid,
etc), but I bet the maintenance burden of anything more fine grained
than that would get pretty excessive.

No doubt racey and unsafe, too.

Yeah, and I'm blissfully ignorant of ptrace.  Imagine me skipping
through a field of daisies with some ptrace wolves hiding in the bushes
at the edge of the meadow.  La la la.

Well, don't conflate the two issues.
Each execution context having its own task struct is intentional, very
much so.  Remember, this started with the fibrils patch series which
indeed shared a single task struct amongst a set of running stacks and
thread infos, etc.  This approach is invasive because it changes the
sleeping entity in the scheduler from a task struct to some new
construct which has a many to one mapping to the task struct.  It
touches vast amounts of code.  This approach is also risky because it
introduces concurrent access to the task struct.  That's a pretty big
auditing burden.  So the syslet approach is a more conservative
alternative.  I think we'll need a pretty strong demonstration of why we
*can't* fix the problems you're seeing with the syslets approach before
taking on the amount of effort needed to divorce the notion of tasks and
scheduling entities.
Each thread being able to return to userspace is an interface design
decision that I'm not prepared to defend.  My current preference for a
user-facing API would be a lot stupider than what Ingo has built around
the atoms, and such, but I haven't taken up that battle as I'm focusing
on the fs/aio.c use of syslets.
My intention with the fs/aio.c syslet use is to only ever have one of
the worker threads returning to userspace.  That's not quite implemented
now.  I think cachemiss threads servicing fs/aio.c could get quite
confused if they exit their scheduling loop if a signal is raised, but
that's a bug -- not a feature :).

Have you looked at how the fibrils stuff did it?  It's a lot more work
than it seems like it should be, on first glance.  You start to modify
things and every few days you trip across another fundamental kernel
construct which needs to be modified :/.

So can we dig a little deeper into what it will take to fix these
problems with the syslet approach?
