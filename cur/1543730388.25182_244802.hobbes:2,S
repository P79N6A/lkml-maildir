thanks Scott, i've applied your patch to my tree - all the changes and
improvements look good (except for a small compilation problem on x86,
asm/time.h doesnt exist there - asm/rtc.h does). The resulting code
booted fine on an SMP and on a UP x86 system. I've uploaded -P9:

(there are no other changes in -P9.)
