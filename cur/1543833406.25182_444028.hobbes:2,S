I'd turn off some of the debugging options, and retest. For instance,
the pi-list debugging option will cause arbitrary latency, which you
seem to show in your results. Normally with PREEMPT_RT turned on you
would expect the timers to trigger within a constant amount of time from
when they are suppose to.
