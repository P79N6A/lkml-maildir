Well, I thought my problem was perhaps related to the scsi cdrom
locking issues that had cropped up. I booted in 2.2.14pre8 (which has
the fix for the scsi cdrom thing). 
Everything looked good for about 6 days, and then all of a sudden, the
stuck processes were back:
root     25497  0.0  0.1  1284  492 ?        S    Nov25   0:00 CROND
root     26316  0.0  0.1  1112  444 ?        D    Nov25   0:33 /usr/bin/slocate -u -e /home/rahl1,/home/rahl2,/tmp,/var/tmp,/usr/tmp,/afs,/net,/proc
root      6620  0.0  0.1  1288  508 ?        S    Nov26   0:00 CROND
root      6624  0.0  0.3  1488  804 ?        D    Nov26   0:00 rdump -9uaf rahl /dev/nst0 /home/jelerak1
root      9438  0.0  0.1  1284  492 ?        S    Nov26   0:00 CROND
root     10638  0.0  0.1  1112  444 ?        D    Nov26   0:35 /usr/bin/slocate -u -e /home/rahl1,/home/rahl2,/tmp,/var/tmp,/usr/tmp,/afs,/net,/proc
26316 /usr/bin/slocate wait_on_buffer
10638 /usr/bin/slocate down_failed
 6624 rdump -9uaf rahl wait_on_buffer
It could be dodgy hardware, but which? There are no errors. I can
access both my scsi disks, my scsi cdrom, and the ide cdrom. If I do a
'sync' it also gets stuck:
25221 sync             wait_on_buffer
anyone have any ideas? Anything I can do to get it to indicate what
buffer it's waiting on?
