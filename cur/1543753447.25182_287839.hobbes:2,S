I can certainly see how it could be useful for debugging.  Perhaps it
should be available to only oneself (like getrlimit restriction) or
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE processes?  (Though, I'm not sure how useful the data
would be to a malicious user).  Also, since the format is both arch
dependent and release dependent I guess it's not ideal for anything that
depends on the format.

BTW, when I went through the resource.h files, I didn't notice any that
leftout rlimits, it was only about ordering.  So I don't think those
ifdefs are necessary.
