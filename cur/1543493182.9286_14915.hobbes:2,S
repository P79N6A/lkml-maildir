This is my main contention. If i dont need them i shouldnt have them.
The relative perfomance differences might actually become important when
making performance comparisons with other OSes which dont have these
'fixes' or on low end systems.
Ugly as #ifdefs may look, they make the code more maintainable in the
sense that you know why some code is in there. I am sure in a short time
that the sun or apple fix will look as if it belongs there in the first
place.
And sure you have to interwork with broken systems, but baby-sitting
vendors(which is what is happening in this case) should be discouraged.
Maybe a time limited patch is a good concept.

No it shouldnt.
Something along  BSDs "HACKS" config option is probably a good idea. 
I can volunteer to scan the TCP code, if this is deemed acceptable -- it
would be extremely difficult to find code that is already assimilated
and not commented.
