Both are basically timesources. That is why I would suggest you upgrade 
the interpolators to timesources. Doing that would enable a gradual 
transition instead of a cutover to a new time subsystem. It should also 
insure that the gains we have made in terms of accuracy of time will be 
preserved in the new system. And the code would be able to use the 
existing proven code that already allows system time with nanosecond 
precision.
