Now I see (at least on Alpha) a constant wailing:
..../linux-2.4.2ac/include/linux/binfmts.h:45: warning: `struct 
mm_struct' declared inside parameter list
..../linux-2.4.2ac/include/linux/binfmts.h:45: warning: its scope is 
only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
Is this somehow related?
