Looking through the code, min() is most always used to find some value
that will not overflow some buffer, i.e.,
    len = min(user_request_len, sizeof(buffer));
The problem is that sizeof() returns an unsigned int (size_t), and the
user request length may be an integer. Everything works fine until
you get to lengths with the high bit set. Then, you are in trouble.
In this case, you could have a 'min()' that does:
#define min(a,b) (unsigned long)(a) < (unsigned long)(b) ? (a) : (b)
... where the comparison (only) is made unsigned, and you keep the
original values. This should work, perhaps in all the current uses.
However, min() is not the mathematical min() anymore. That's fine,
but it probably should not be called min() unless it is truly a min()
function.
So, I suggest that instead of using some macro in a header, if you
need min() you make one in your code called MIN(). Problem solved.
Your macro will do exactly what you want it to do. If It's broken,
you get to fix it (or keep the pieces).
