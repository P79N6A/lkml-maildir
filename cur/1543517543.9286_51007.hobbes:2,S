  I used to get these errors too whet accessing my 2nd CD-ROM. Now I'm OK
  after
    1) applying Andre's EIDE patch
    2) overclocking only to 378 MHz (before was 418 MHz)
    3) playing with BIOS (but at last boosted to max - CPU clock made
       the deal)
  It was not in IDE cable and/or CDs but it may work at someone's pc.
  If your CD medium does not work anywhere it is not the right aid
  but try to play with your system settings.
