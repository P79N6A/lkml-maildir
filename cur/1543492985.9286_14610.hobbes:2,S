The informix DBA is assigining informix "raw" partitions (i.e. /dev/sda4,
etc) even though I have mentioned that linux does not have raw disk
access. also given the performance problems that the ext2fs has with large
files I am not sure that we are really better off with a bunch of 2G files
anyway.
Thanks for the info.
