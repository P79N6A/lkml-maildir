Hello,
  I was wondering if anyone knows where the frame buffer support in the
kernel is heading. I seems to me for such projects as Linux/PalmPilot
that this is the perfect way to get X up and running.
It also occured to me if we move 2D and 3D support into a generic interface
in conjunction with the frame buffer we would only ever need one X server
that would be fully integrated with one OpenGl app. There could
also be software 2D and 3D support for those CPU with not enough
power.
Who do I need to talk to this about? Is the frame buffer heading in
this direction?
Thanks
Leslie Donaldson
