Personally, I'd call it confusing and inconsistent terminology. Or maybe  
confusing OS terminology and OO terminology. But anyone familiar with some  
of it should be able to understand which is meant from the context.

However, that's not how most OS boundaries actually look. Typically, they  
look like
        syscall(SYS_read, handle, buffer, size)
but could just as easily look like
        syscall(handle, OP_read, buffer, size)
It's not as if the idea of asking the handle about the operations were  
foreign to Linux, after all. That's what the VFS interface does (this  
time, with
        file->f_op->read(file, buf, count, pos)
), and a number of other kernel-internal interfaces as well.
That is, asking a kernel object for a certain operations (also called  
"calling the object's method" or "sending the object a message" in various  
circles, but then those don't often seem to say "message passing") from  
user space, should mean doing a syscall(object handle, operation code,  
arguments).
There are actually good arguments for doing it this way, very similar to  
the Unix "everything is a file" idea - for example, you need just *one*  
end-this-object operation that can work to close files, drop semaphores,  
drop shared memory, what-have-you. (NT actually does this, it's called  
CloseHandle IIRC.)
It's not even that far from the Unix model. Just call everything a file  
handle, though it might be a funny kind. The real benefits, of course,  
come when you wonder "could I implement this operation for this kind of  
handle, too?". If you don't look at handles as objects, you might never  
think of it.
I've thought for a while I'd like to experiment with an OS where you had  
an OS boundary like this, but you could actually do IPC where you see an  
object in another process as such an OS handle. Of course, you'd need some  
kind of information on what the arguments look like so that the OS can  
actually move them to the other process, and it should still be efficient.  
Doing transparent remote communications from this model is fairly easy,  
just set up a proxy process. Nothing new there. You could of course do it  
in-kernel, but in-kernel RPC is not all that funny.
Well, someone probably has done it before. But still, an OS with built-in,  
efficient OO IPC would be interesting. And I see no reason why one  
couldn't build a perfectly compatible POSIX environment on top of that.
