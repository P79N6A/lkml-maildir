This is because the files are human-readable, nothing to do with binary vs. plain
text. proc should be made (entirely ?) of value-per-file trees, and a back-compat
compatprocfs union mounted for the files people and programs are expecting.

I don't see that it's at all useful: it just makes life harder. You yourself
state above that read(2) parsing of human readable files is "not nice at all",
and now you're saying it is "just too damn practical".
Just drop the human-readable stuff from the new /proc, please.
In what way is parsing /proc/meminfo in a script more practical than 
cat /proc/meminfo/total ?

This just seems needless duplication, and fragile. Representing things as directory
hierarchies and single-value files in text seems to me to be much nicer, just as
convenient, and much nicer for fs/proc/ source...
