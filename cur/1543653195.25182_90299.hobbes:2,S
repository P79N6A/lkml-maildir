Correct, for a cfork() implementation two separate pointers would be
needed.  Ingo was asking the same question.
Note that I haven't received a request for such a fork interface variant
yet.  There obviously is a problem with fork() in MT apps but people are
either not hitting it or working around it.  In any case, cfork() would
at least for the time being Linux-specific anyway.
If people are in fact interested in such a new interface then you should
start asking Linus to change his mind on the second parameter.  I'm at
this point in time neutral since there is no urgent need from my
perspective to implement cfork(),

This doesn't work since it would overwrite the TID field in the calling
thread's descriptor.
