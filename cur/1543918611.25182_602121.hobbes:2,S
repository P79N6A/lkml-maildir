Short history what I know about this file:
after 2.6.22 the accounting was changes to use sched_clock and to use stime 
and utime only for the split. This is where task_utime and task_stime were 
introduced. See the code in 2.6.23-rc1.
Unfortunately this broke the accouting on s390 which already has precise 
numbers in utime and stime. So the code was partially reverted to use stime 
and utime again where appropriate, which are of type  cputime_t.

These conversions can reduce the accuracy to jiffie resolution, but should not
make the value non-monotonic. I dont think that here is the problem. 
But: it seems that p->se.sum_exec_runtime can change indeed. That would 
explain stime going backward, if sum_exec_runtime was increases in the middle 
of the calculation. 
The logic of task_stime and task_utime was introduced by 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=b27f03d4bdc145a09fb7b0c0e004b29f1ee555fa
Frans can you test this patch if this makes stime and utime monotic again?
It basically reverts the rest of  b27f03d4bdc145a09fb7b0c0e004b29f1ee555fa and 
should restore the 2.6.22 behavior. The process time is used from tasks utime 
and stime instead of the scheduler clock. That means, in general after a long 
period of time, it is less accurate than the current time and behaves like 
2.6.22.
