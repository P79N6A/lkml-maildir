I'm going to run a compile/load test overnight, but the test that
triggered it every time previously failed to do so with this patch.
pdflush is behaving so far, and I'll say you've figured it out for now,
with the final verdict in about 8 hours.
Does this mean that, if there were too many dirty pages and not enough
time to write them all back, that the dirty page list just stopped being
traversed, stuck on a single page? That would make explain why this was
easier to trigger on NFS than a local FS, due to the extra latency, etc.
Maybe I should look into tuning my NFS server while we're at it, as yours
must be much faster ;)
