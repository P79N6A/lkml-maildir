For a general case, that cost is leveraged by the improvement in scheduling,
by filling out the IO channels better, and thus, using most resources more
efficiently. I did some dirty tests that showed that the preemptible kernel
performed more or less one second better than the normal one when unzipping
and compiling a kernel [dirty general case]. The std deviation is around the
time difference, so we can quite conclude the impact is zero -- asides from
the improvement in responsiveness].
