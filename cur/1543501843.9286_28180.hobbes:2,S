   Because 2.2
      * has devfs
      * has reiserfs
      * supports more devices
      * is supposed to be faster
      * corrects some bugs
      * has better support for IDE
   I don't feel that Linux should emulate the more unsavoury aspects of
   Microsoft Windows -- in that when you update the kernel you have to
   willy-nilly update everything else so that it would work.  Of course
   2.2.x is basically obsolete now that the 2.3 branch is active, but
   it will make an adequate placeholder until 2.4 is released.

                  \/                             surprised when 2.4 comes along.
