"enterprise" XOR security ? I think you understand the problem with
your approach well ;-)
Linux scales well from PDAs to large clusters. This is quite an
achievement. Other operating systems are not able to match this.
So why do you think that Linux should try to mimic their flaws ?
Out of pity ?
BTW, parallel development does happen all the time. The point of
convergence in a single "mainstream" kernel is that you benefit
from all the work that's been going on while you did the stuff
you care most about.
