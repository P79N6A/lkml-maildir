Subject: [Patch 3/4] cpusets remove useless validation check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As reported to me by Simon Derr, there was an off by one
error in checking the usage count in validate_change().
However, after realizing that there was no way to exploit
this error, I determined that the check (for an empty
cpuset) could never fail here.  This is because:
 1) other code ensures we only attach a task to non-empty
    cpusets, and
 2) there is no way to make a non-empty cpuset empty again.
So, rather than fix the useless check, just remove it.
