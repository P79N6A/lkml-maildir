Which simply is not possible, especially for shared irqs.
Can you please elaborate why this effort is moot, instead of throwing
the usual flamewar arguments around ?
The concept of UIO divides the problem in two spaces:
- kernel interface, which controls interrupts and mapping
- user space restricted interface
I don't see why the necessarity of a kernel stub driver is a killer
argument. The chip internals, which companies might want to protect are
certainly not in the interrupt registers.
Aside of that there are huge performance gains for certain application /
driver scenarios and I really don't see an advantage that people are
doing excactly the same thing in out of tree hackeries with a lot of
inconsistent user land interfaces.
