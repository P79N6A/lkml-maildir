Unlikely to be the case this time. I get a sequence of 28 bytes that is
wrong in the data and often the wrong data is a copy from data 64 or 128
byte earlier in the file. If this was not on a PC with cache coherency I
would guess that someone forgot to do a cache invalidate/flush. But I do
wonder why I only see this problem with nfs over udp.
