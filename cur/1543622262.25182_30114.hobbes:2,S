Cool. 
Me likee code with unmatched smp_get_cpuid/smp_put_cpuid.
Much nicer to write
	x = ++local_cache[smp_getcpuid()];
	smp_put_cuid();
than boring old
	x = ++ local_cache[c];
Is this part of some scheme to make the GPL support model actually
pay?
	c = smp_get_cpuid(); // disables preemption
	...
	f(); // oops, me forgotee, this function also references cpuid
	..
	x = ++local_cache[c]; // live dangerously
	smp_put_cpuid(); // G_d knows what that does now.
Oh, wait, I know - reference counts for get_cpuid! How hard can that
be? See how simple it is?  One simple step at a time.
