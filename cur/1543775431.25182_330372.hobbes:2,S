I.e., something like 90% of the use of Linux here. OK.

Who is to say what is "data" and what is "system files"? And if you are
limiting yourself to /user/ data, why not have the /user/ decide how they
want to organize it, and give them the tools?

Just like each previous claim "this /must/ be the next cool technology!",
also called later the "dotcom crash"...

That works without screwing up the whole system, AFAIU.

Could you please explain in plain english? The only part I get out is
"propietary API", and I don't see anybody advocating such here.

And who says that a normal user isn't allowed to annotate each and every
file with its purpose or something else? I can very well imagine a system
in which users (say students in a Linux class) want to do so... on a shared
machine. Or users having a shared MP3 or photograph or ... collection, with
individual notes on each. Or even developers wanting to annotate source
code files with their comments, but leave them read-only (or have them
under SCM).

Bingo! And thus goes much of the supposed advantage of this nonsense.
[I see that /opponents/ are accused here of lack of imagination, while I
 see that the /proponents/ lack imagination... or perhaps just real-world
 experience.]

Presumably based on ReiserFS 4, which then has to be ported to whatever
platform you want to run Java on ASAP? Great for you! Wait a bit, and
you'll get what you want then, even across the board!
