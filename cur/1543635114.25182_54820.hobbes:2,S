Subject: [Bug] 2.5.25 build as one user and install as root

2.5.25 existing build system has a nasty bug.  Build as one user then
make install as root.  It does supurious recompiles of some files and
leaves them owned as root.  All of these files are now owned by root
and cause problems when the build user wants to rebuild.
arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
arch/i386/boot/compressed/piggy.o
arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux
arch/i386/boot/.setup.o.cmd
arch/i386/boot/setup.o
arch/i386/boot/setup
arch/i386/boot/vmlinux.bin
include/linux/compile.h
init/.version.o.cmd
init/version.o
init/init.o
.version
vmlinux
Not a problem for kbuild 2.5 of course, it checks and aborts if
installing as root would require recompiles.
