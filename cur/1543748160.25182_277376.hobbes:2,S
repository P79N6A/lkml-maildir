could enable WAKEUP_TIMING and LATENCY_TRACING, boot into the new kernel
and do:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
then you'll get the worst-case trace in /proc/latency_trace. Does it
show any millisecs-range latencies?
also, do this:
  chrt -f 90 -p `pidof 'IRQ 8'`
  chrt -f 91 -p `pidof 'IRQ 0'`
to make sure IRQ8 doesnt get preempted by other stuff. How often do you
get the rtc histogram in the syslog? Does tvtime use /dev/rtc for normal
operations perhaps? If yes then you might want to disable RTC_HISTOGRAM.
