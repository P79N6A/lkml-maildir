I think we should map _all_ kernel memory with PAGE_GLOBAL: most
distributions heavily use modules, and they would win from mapping
everything with _PAGE_GLOBAL.
I've attached an old patch that does that:
* PAGE_KERNEL and PAGE_KERNELRO are updated at runtime: if the cpu supports
PAGE_GLOBAL, then that bit is set.
* a new flush_tlb_pge() macro.
* you might get rid of kmap_prot, just use PAGE_KERNEL?
The patch won't apply, but I don't have access to the kernel right now.
AFAICS you can simply replace "local_flush_tlb()" in
do_flush_tlb_all_local() with "__flush_tlb_all()" in smp.c, everything else
should work.
