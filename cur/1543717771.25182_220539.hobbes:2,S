Version 2.7.2 of perfctr, the Linux performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
This version changes the user/kernel interface from ioctl()s
to syscalls. Requested by Andrew Morton (2.6-mm kernel maintainer).
This breaks compatibility with perfctr-2.6 user-space code,
so don't even think about using this except for testing.
It also only works in the 2.6.6 and 2.6.6-mm2 kernels.
The new user-space syscall() wrappers only work with certain
gcc versions and gcc options: x86 without -fPIC and ppc
with gcc-3.2 work, while x86 with -fPIC, x86_64, and ppc
with gcc-3.4.0 don't. This will be fixed in the next release.
Version 2.7.2, 2004-05-14
- Changes for submission to 2.6.6-mm kernel. Replaced
  ioctl() interface by new syscall (by request, not choice).
  Eliminated module support and backwards compatibility.
  Many other cleanups.
