Did you heard / read about Herring?
I found .pdf somewhere (I think I still have it). It is better alternative 
to ECB or CBC algorithms used in cryptoloop (if I understand good). Could 
something like that be implemented in dm-crypt? Is it already?
Could somebody write dm-compress (compressing not encrypting)? Is it 
technically possible (can device mapper handle different data size at 
input, differet at output)? (I think there is compressing loop patch.)
Could dm first compress data (even with weak algorithm), then encrypt, to 
make statistical analysis harder?
And, to be sure, does dm-crypto add anything in the begining (ie. 
header) or in other places to the stored data? Or it is the same data 
(same size) but encrypted?
