Subject: PCI Quirk / Hidden Bus Report
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I received:
PCI: Bus #0b (-#0e) is hidden behind transparent bridge #0a (-#0a) (try
'pci=assign-busses')
Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently
in my dmesg in 2.6.22, and am reporting it.  Context of message follows.
 Full dmesg output available on request.  This is a Clevo d900t laptop
motherboard, and everything works perfectly on it.
