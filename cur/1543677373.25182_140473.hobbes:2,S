It would have been nice if the original submitter of the patch would
have specified what bios they were using.  IO-APIC support on my board
seemed to be working nicely until eventually it got disabled. :)
I am using the 5.6 bios from their site for the BX Master -- the 6163
Pro (v2) has a totally different BIOS versions and I'm not sure if a
blanket black-list for this board would be the best idea.
Thanks,
