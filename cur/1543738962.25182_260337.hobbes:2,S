wait_event() seems to be what I was looking for; I don't really like the
condition being an argument.

Well, that wasn't what I meant exactly. I was looking for a standard
way to wait on a condition so that it would still work when spinlocks
are converted to mutexes such as these new RT patches seem to do;
wait_event() seens to provide this, although I like to POSIX mutex/cond
semantics better.

P.S. I seem to have been removed from the LKML right after posting
my question (it was the last message I received). Is there something
terribly stupid I may have done? Was the question _that_ stupid?
