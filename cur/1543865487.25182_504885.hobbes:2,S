That's also not true for me. I really don't understand why people keep saying
that rates above 11MBit don't work, because they do (and always did) on all
of my 4306 cards.
Sure, rates above 11M don't work for 4318 and similiar, but for those cards
not even 11M works, so one has to use 1M or something.
And there is absolutely no limit to 11MBit in the code.
