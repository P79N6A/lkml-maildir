It is a little weird, but it gave flexibility for most archs.
ISTR I had issues relocating the percpu area to 0, but I look forward to your 
code!

Hmm, did someone cc me on the patchset and I missed it?

Of course; you just need congruence in your allocation across CPUs.  It's 
possible, but no worse than the requirements on other schemes where you can 
reach a variable with a single addition for the CPU.

We've had practical problems getting the compiler to eke out the potential 
benefit.  That's why we settled for an offset between where the compiler 
expected and where the variable actually was.
Cheers,
