           Summary: Errors message and paused system with IDE ZIP
    Kernel Version: 2.5.69
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk
         Submitter: greg@ulima.unil.ch
Distribution: Mandrake 9.2 (Cooker)
Hardware Environment: MSI Max2-BLR with ICH4 IDE
Software Environment: ???
Problem Description: I got those errors:
May 11 15:12:39 localhost kernel: hdb: DMA interrupt recovery
May 11 15:12:39 localhost kernel: hdb: lost interrupt
I was thinking the problem came because it was slave, so I put the disc as
master withtout slave:
May 18 01:35:42 localhost kernel: hda: DMA interrupt recovery
May 18 01:35:42 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
These message aren't so annoying, but when they accurs, the system is near a
"pause" mode and react really bad...
Steps to reproduce: wait...
