This is not about propagating, but about making things work, and it is not
as easy as you might think, because mmu context/tlb stuff has changed a lot
in recent kernels. It took David Miller at least a week to make things work
on sparc64, and I'm still chasing spurious corruptions there.
Expect sparc32 be ready in a week or so if things go right.
Cheers,
