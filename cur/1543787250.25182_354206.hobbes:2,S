Three cleanup / fixes for CPU GDT alignment.  First comes from Andrew Morton,
PnP BIOS driver was broken during build.  I tested and fixed the PnP BIOS
code for SMP kernels, and third comes a fix for hotplug.
I included Andrew's initial fix for the benefit of those who didn't get it.
Testing: 4-way SMP boot/halt loops with APM and PnP compatible BIOS against
2.6.14-rc2.
