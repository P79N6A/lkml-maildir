I don't but you can try to isolate the changeset introducing the
corruption with git-bisect:
http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.3.3/howto/isolate-bugs-with-bisect.txt
So, in your case, you do:
<clone Linux mainline git repository>
# git bisect start
# git bisect bad v2.6.18
# git bisect good v2.6.17
then
<recompile and test>
<git bisect [good|bad] depending on results>
<repeat until you've narrowed down the changeset>
Also, please remember to send your .config when reporting bugs as
described in REPORTING-BUGS.
