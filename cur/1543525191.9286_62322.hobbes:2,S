Sure. I'm running 2.3.41. I was able to compile a number of previous
2.3.x kernels.  However, not all modules, devices, or interfaces like
RAID are going to work on beta kernels.

    The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:     2.2.14
    The latest beta version of the Linux kernel is:       2.3.42
    The latest prepatch (alpha) version *appears* to be:  2.3.43-8

Note that the latest stable version is 2.2.14. The 2.3.x kernels
are beta versions.
You can help by enabling your options, making patches to get your
devices to compile and, hopefully work, and submitting them. 
Cheers,
