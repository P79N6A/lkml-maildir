Will do, thanks.  Oh, another thing - what is the situation
where a NULL bdev would be passed into __blockdev_direct_IO?
All the filesystems seem to pass i_sb->s_bdev, so I guess it
must be blkdev_direct_IO - can I_BDEV(inode) ever be NULL on
a block device inode (doesn't sound right)?  If it cannot, I
suppose we should remove those NULL bdev checks too...
cheers.
