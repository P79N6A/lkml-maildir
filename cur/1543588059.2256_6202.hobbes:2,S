Take a chill pill, dude.
Dave's questions are perfectly valid.  Obviously, if a bunch of 
kick-butt programmers want to go off a create a "from-scratch" 
X11 implementation, please go right ahead!  If it turns out to 
be great (have rock-solid support for legacy apps, have screaming 
fast accellerated graphics drivers for all major hardware, support 
anti-aliased fonts, alpha-blending and so on in a way that is 
compatible with XFree86 APIs) then, sure, I'll switch over to the 
new X Server.  Of course, in the seven years that this project 
will take, XFree86 will have evolved quite a bit.
I suppose the new X Server could jettison support for legacy 
apps and only support applications written with the latest RAD 
toolkits.  There might be some value there.  This might also 
allow the new server to stabilize sooner.
