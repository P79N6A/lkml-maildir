Ah. I forgot about this :-( Sorry.

Big thnx.

Ok, part about buf was my stupidity, I agree here. But about extending
sys_size it WAS NOT. Some other "bright" soul changed code so sys_size
bigger then $FFFF will be accepted and not done anything about two byte
field where sys_size is stored in the end. THAT can be called stupid, no?

Agree 100%.

No. When you have field 2 bytes in size and you want to store there number
bigger than $FFFF you MUST increase field. Otherwise what's the point ?
I'm little surprised nobody noticed it for so long :-(
