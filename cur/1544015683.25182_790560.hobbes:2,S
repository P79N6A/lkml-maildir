Hi Dmitry,
From the gpio_keys.c, I can see that request_irq is assuming all the
gpio line interrupts to be edge triggered one, but what if we have
level triggered interrupts? Doesn't this flags need to come from
platform data hooks too? So, that we can specify either
(IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING |  IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING ) or (IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH |
IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW) based on the platform data?
