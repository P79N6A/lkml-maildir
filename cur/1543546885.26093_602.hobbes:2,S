Nope.  I've just put out a new test release against 2.2 which merges
in various bits which have been under development, so basically
there's just the finishing of the metadata-only journaling before
we're functionally complete for ext3-1.0 on 2.2.  At that point I can
seriously start to move it to 2.4.  Until then it will be 2.2-only
unless somebody presents me with patches.  :-)
Cheers,
 Stephen
