Here is the ksymoops. The first one (ksymoops.txt) is the ksymoops run without the
modules loaded.
The second one (ksymoops2.txt) is with appletalk.o psnap.o and p8022.o loaded.
Only one line is different:
gentoogato root # diff ksymoops.txt ksymoops2.txt

I hope this is helpful. Let me know if there is anything more I can run.
