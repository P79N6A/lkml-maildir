I've just tried 2.6.22-rc4 and sound doesn't work. It has never worked before, 
unless I disable ACPI.
dmesg (ALSA debug messages are enabled):
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1b.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1b.0[A] -> GSI 22 (level, low) -> IRQ 21

Any help is greatly appreciated.
