Known problem.  Old problem.  `initrd' support broke somewhere around
2.3.20.  If you don't need it, just disable it -- works for me.
Check the list archives for a recent thread named "Kernels do not
compile anymore".  A patch to get initrd working again was posted by
B.D. Elliot (sp?).  I haven't tried this patch, since I don't need
initrd.
Also ... is there a *good* reason you are wanting to use MODVERSIONS
with development kernels?  I ask only out of curiosity: typically it
doesn't buy you very much at this rate of development.
