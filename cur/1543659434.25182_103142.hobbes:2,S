OK, added. Now rmmod usb-storage followed by insmod usb-storage
resulted in an oops, as usual, but after a fresh reboot:
Yes indeed, just like desired:
% ls -l /sysfs/block/sdb/device
... -> ../../devices/pci0/00:07.2/usb1/1-2/1-2.4/1-2.4.1/2:0:0:0
Good.
Now that you removed this scsi device from /sysfs/devices, I suppose
you'll also want to remove
/sysfs/devices/1:0:6:0
which is an Iomega ZIP drive on the parallel port, driver imm.c,
device sda.
(I can also do it but have no time now. Friday.)
All the best - Andries
