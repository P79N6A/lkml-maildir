hello,
this is PII, MMX, 233 MHZ, single CPU lots of ram.
>gcc --version
2.7.2.3
build 2.3.42 OK, and ran it for a day, suddenly, things sort of
hanged. unable to even kill X (CTRL-ALT-backspace), shell
commands do not return, can't open new window since
can't type. unable to move windows around, nothing seems to 
move except for the cursor!
this happened 2 times. So I am back to running 2.3.39, which
never had this problem.
anyone else running 2.3.42 and saw a similar problem?
thanks,
Nasser
