Ok, this part is obviously sane.

is it really sane these days to split out gigabit from the "regular" 
ethernets? gigabit ethernet is getting quite a bit more common than it 
used to be, and a lot of the gigabit devices are just "standard ethernet" 
as far as the user is concerned, and in fact they are often _used_ in just 
regular 10/100Mbps setups.
In other words: it's quite understandable if somebody doesn't even
_realize_ that his chip supports gigabit speeds these days.
So wouldn't the right fix be to just remove the distinction between 
"regular" and "gigabit" ethernet, and put them all in the same menu?
If the menu then grows really big, maybe we can split it according to some 
_saner_ split. Not that I can see off-hand what that would be, but..
