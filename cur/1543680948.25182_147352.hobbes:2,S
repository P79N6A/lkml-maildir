Something was touched since I did not have this problem with the
2.4.21-ac
series which included hfsplus. This problem arrived with 2.4.22-pre3
(when hfsplus was introduced) so there was some merge issue maybe?
Actually, diffing .22-pre3-ac1 and .22-pre3 shows a few more fixes with
operator precedence missing in -pre3, like
-       if (!file->f_flags & O_DIRECT)
+       if (!(file->f_flags & O_DIRECT))
Which I am sure must be fixed.
