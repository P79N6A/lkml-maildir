What fails is when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD and CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE are 
both set.  I realize (now) that I don't need initrd at all, and 
initramfs works fine by itself, as you have tested.  It seems that the 
kernel may need some exclusion between these two mechanisms while the 
difference is sorted out.
I'm not totally up on Kconfig files, but maybe something like this in 
drivers/block/Kconfig:
config INITRAMFS_SOURCE
      string "Initramfs source file(s)"
      default ""
      depends on BLK_DEV_INITRD=n
Regarding the documenation it would have been helpful to me if 
Documentation/initrd.txt had a reference to 
Documentation/early-userspace/README.  I'm not sure who maintains that 
directory, or I'd send a suggestion.  tldp.org?
