Hi
I am having a problem with my Mitac M722 laptop.
When I pull the main cord whilst the machine is running, it continues to
operate for 1-3 secs on battery power and then hangs/locks solid.
After a reboot ... there's nothing obvious in the logs.
This problem does not occur on 2.4 (I've tried all the way up to
2.4.22-bk27) and does not happen <= 2.5.56.
I've had a look at the change log for 2.5.57 and through the patch for
obvious things ... but nothing stands out.
Can anybody help me with this / suggest a plan of attack to narrow the
problem down?
TIA
Daveh
