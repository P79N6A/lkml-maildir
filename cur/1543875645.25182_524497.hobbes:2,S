Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - small fixes for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/27/210

These are all 2.6.22 material.  Patch 1 fixes what appears to be a
i386 compilation bug, so we'll want Andi's ack on that, probably.
