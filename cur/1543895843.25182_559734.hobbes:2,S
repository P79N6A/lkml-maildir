Shouldn't the vm_dirty_ratio be based on the speed of the device, and
not the size of memory?  So slower devices can't keep as much in
memory as fast devices?  That would seem to be a better metric.  And
of course those with hundreds of disks will then complain we're taking
too much memory as well, even though they can handle it.  
So per-device vm_dirty_ratio, capped with a vm_dirty_total_ratio seems
to be what we want, right?
