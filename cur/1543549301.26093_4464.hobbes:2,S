Hi all,
I have recently been plagued with the problem of depmod complaining of
missing symbols after a kernel compile - and I am completely stumped as
to what is causing this.
- I confirm that no pre-existing /usr/src/linux or /lib/modules/2.2.17
directories exist.
- I download and unpack a virgin v2.2.17 kernel into an empty
/usr/src/linux directory.
- I compile the kernel with the following commands:
make menuconfig ; make dep ; make clean ; make bzImage ; make modules ;
make modules_install
- The compile ends successfully without any errors.
- I copy the resulting bzImage and System.map files to the /boot
directory, renaming them System.map-2.2.17 and vmlinubz-2.2.17
respectively.
- I run 
depmod -m /boot/System.map-2.2.17 -a 2.2.17
And I get this:
[root@jolanda /root]# depmod -m /boot/System.map-2.2.17 -a 2.2.17
/lib/modules/2.2.17/fs/nls_koi8-r.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.2.17/fs/nls_iso8859-15.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.2.17/fs/nls_iso8859-14.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.2.17/fs/nls_iso8859-9.o: unresolved symbol(s)

If I ignore the above, configure LILO with the new kernel and reboot,
the same problem happens when depmod -a runs during startup. The system
is a Redhat Linux v6.1 system.
Has anyone any idea what on earth is causing this? I have been trawling
the internet for a solution to this problem, but in all the
documentation depmod is supposed to "just work" and in my case it "just
doesn't".
Anyone encountered this before?
Regards,
Graham
