Hi Jens,
  Thanks for the patch; unfortunatly at the moment I can neither confirm
or deny whether the patch works - since the damn thing won't crash on me
with or without the patch - I suspect it depends on system mood.
But I have a PDA logging console so if it happens I should catch it.
Thanks again,
Dave
