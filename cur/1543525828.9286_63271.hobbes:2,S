I have some legacy proxy software designed to be spawned by inetd which 
I'd like to port over to Linux using the transparent proxy mechanism.
Is there a mechanism to retrieve (by socket) the interface on which 
the transparent connection arrived for TCP?  Get_sockname() will get
the ultimate destination, but not the local I/F.
Glancing through the network source, the kernel appears to keep track
of the interface connection number by socket, but does not appear
to allow the application layer a way to get to it.  Kernel hacking
was done on the original implementation and I'd like to avoid it,
if possible.
Many Thanks
Thomas Hoyt
