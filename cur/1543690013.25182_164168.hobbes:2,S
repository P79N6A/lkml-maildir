Side notes:
 - Jeff made a mailing list if you're really interested in sparse 
   (majordomo@vger.kernel.org, the list name is "linux-sparse")
 - most of the warnings right now seem to be "bad constant expression" due 
   to the adoption of C99 variable-sized arrays in <linux/bitmap.h>. I 
   don't much like it.
 - the rest are mostly due to the address space checks. Some of them are 
   likely trivial to fix, but the most interesting ones (in the networking 
   code) are because the networking code re-uses the same data structures 
   for both kernel and user addresses. David said he'd fix it a long time 
   ago, but he never got around to it..
Finally:
 - it's not seriously usable yet. It's _almost_ there, but especially the 
   networking thing has kept me from being very motivated lately. I've 
   documented some of the preprocessor limitations in the "validation" 
   tests.
Have fun.
