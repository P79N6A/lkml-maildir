Hi,
running on 2.2.16, we have still the problem with
the D process (the server has 384ram)
ovh      29453  0.4 39.0 167336 151556 ?     D    12:02   0:01 perl stats_age.pl
ovh      29605  0.5 40.1 167336 155748 ?     D    12:02   0:01 perl stats_age.pl
29453   500 down_f perl stats_age.pl
29605   500 down_f perl stats_age.pl
the only solution in this case is to reboot, but
kernel can not unmount the device and we have 1h30 of fsck !
What we saw is when a process takes lot of memory, 
it switchs sometimes in D state. is there any solution to 
fix it in 2.2.x ?
