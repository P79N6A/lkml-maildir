Again, you're saying that AA is not confining unconfined processes.
That's a given. If unconfined processes assist confined processes in
breeching their confinement, yes, that is not mediated.
You're basically saying that anything but system-wide mandatory access
control is pointless.
If you want to go down that route, what is your reply to me saying that
SELinux cannot mediate NFS mounts - if the server is not confined using
SELinux as well? The argument is really, really moot and pointless. Yes,
unconfined actions can affect confined processes. 
That's generally true for _any_ security system.

I'm quite sure that this reply is not AA specific as you try to make it
appear.

I want to restrict certain possibly untrusted applications and
network-facing services from accessing certain file patterns, because as
a user and admin, that's the mindset I'm used to. I might be interested
in mediating other channels too, but the files are what I really care
about. I'm inclined to trust the other processes.
Your use case mandates complete system-wide mediation, because you want
full data flow analysis. Mine doesn't.
