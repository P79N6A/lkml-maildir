Well, the main problem is that since the 2.6.0 kernel headers are used
by glibc on debian (and maybe others) it makes building userland
packages about this difficult. I was asking to know if there was
something inherently bad about implementing this in the userland kernel
headers provided by the glibc, as the glibc debian maintainers have not
been responsive about this, but i know since that a fixed package will
be provided once the situation resulting from the intrusion is cleared.

But also no particular reason not to use it, right ?
Thanks for your reply.
