If that ever occurs we are in deep deep doodo - this should be a BUG() so
we stop the box before we do serious damage.

This one should always have been a BUG(). At the point we hit this (which
we never have yet) the returned data for the command executed is *lost*
and we return garbage. It's a case that will only trigger due to a clear
internal bug (where we want the driver author to catch it promptly) or
memory corruption. It's not something that will pop up from a quirky bit
of timing.

Ditto should be a BUG().

If this ever occurs we are writing garbage to the ATAPI device and
continuing is a very bad idea. It could remain a warn but the command
issue should be aborted
(Should be a WARN/return)
	if (qc->dev->cdb_len < 12) {
		WARN_ON_ONCE(...)
		return;
