Not really, as I've explained, I want to do all these stuff in kernel 
space. More specifically, I want to write a newbie kernel module. In 
this module, I'll do something with a raw block device (with no 
filesystem). For example, I want to do block I/O operations on ramdisk, 
and I want to set the block size of ramdisk to whatever value I want 
(power of 2 of course).
Any comments?
Thanks,
Lei
