I changed motherboard and went for a (way cheaper but older) ASUS M2A-VM
with is based on the AMD 690G chipset with the exact same
kernel/phenom/memory/disk/box and installed the latest vendor BIOS
(1604). It took longer (25 hours) to get a stuck and unkillable process
but it did happen, but I got nothing in /var/log/kern.log this time.
In order to rule out a motherboard or memory issue I bought an Athlon X2
4400+ EE and put in replacement of the phenom with the exact same
kenel/memory/disk/box and my stress test has been running for 72 hours
without any issue so far.
So in the end it seems to be a problem specific to phenom 9500 with the
linux kernel.
Did anyone succeed in getting a stable linux box based on a phenom 9500
processor ? "Stable" defined as being able to survive a few days
compiling at -j4 (this is for the GCC compile farm after all :).
If so I'm interested by the exact motherboard/bios version/kernel
version/distro used.
As proposed in my first email, ssh root access is possible to my machine
(with either motherboard).
Thanks in advance,
Laurent
