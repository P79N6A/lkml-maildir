Don't include _any_ libc includes when compiling kernel modules,
they aren't valid in this context.  It is a bug in your C source file.
Glibc or older libc.

Unless you have to because the glibc includes aren't complete.
O_DIRECTORY anyone?  Then watch as your program fails to compile.
_Must_ <linux/fcntl.h> and <fcntl.h> be incompatible?
Personally I Autoconf my way around this disaster area.
Ugly but works.
