indeed! Does the patch below do the trick?

Subject: softlockup: do the wakeup from a hrtimer
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
David Miller reported soft lockup false-positives that trigger
on NOHZ due to CPUs idling for more than 10 seconds.
The solution is to drive the wakeup of the watchdog threads
not from the timer tick (which has no guaranteed frequency),
but from the watchdog tasks themselves.
