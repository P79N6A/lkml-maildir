I am running gnome netleds_applet version 0.9.1 and it is sporadically
dieing, with a various kernel oops warnings in my syslogs. I caught
the last one and ran it through ksymoops - I've attached the output of
that. It happens every few days and doesn't seem to be caused by
anything specific that I can see. Always the same program, and the
overall stability of the system seems unaffected. If it makes any
difference I have two copies of netleds running (they monitor eth0
and ppp0 separately). The processor is a Cyric 6x86MX233. Any other
information you'd find useful, please contact me!
yours
