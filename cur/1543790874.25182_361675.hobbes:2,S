I guess you are right and wrong. The architecture has the limitation, 
the chipset as well and the OS. According to this document, it is the 
fault of the architecture as well as it requires to support addressing 
which is not available *stock*, only several other providers have added 
such "mapping" to get a better use of the memory.

I really don't want to argue on who knows more or less, just want to 
clarify the fact that IA32 will have this problem normally and that the 
chipsets that go with it also will make this noticeable.
If you don't believe me, contact the guys who built the Arch which I 
think are the ones that made the document?
