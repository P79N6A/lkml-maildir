I have used userspace tools for managing multiple machines that spawn 
tasks in parallel on multiple machines and then buffers them per-machine 
to display the output of the commands in order, no matter which one 
finished first.
for example 'dsh m1,m2 ls /' would always result in
m1 .
m1 ..
.
.
m2 .
m2 ..
.
.
even if m2 finished before m1
why can't the detection be done in parallel, but the regestration of 
detected devices be done in order?
