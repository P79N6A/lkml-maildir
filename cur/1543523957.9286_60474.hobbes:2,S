Actually, we can measure this and take it into account.
In 2.3 we can use tsk->avg_slice and cacheflush_time to
decide if you want to wait on this cpu or take advantage
of another (idle) cpu...
We should be able to check for this in __schedule_tail()
and set a flag in the long-running process accordingly.
