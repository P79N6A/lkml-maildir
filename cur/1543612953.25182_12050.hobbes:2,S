Yes, as the length of an email approaches infinity the chance of saying

I don't know how bad it was in the old code, but now the little-ended data is 
confined to get_block/truncate, as it should be.  However, reading ahead...

I'm not proposing to change this, but I would have chosen Davem's approach in 
this case, with the aid of:
	typedef struct { u32 value; } le_u32;
This is a no-op for Intel, and it would make things nicer for non-intel 
arches, for what that's worth.  But it seems I've stepped into an old 
flamewar, so I'm getting out while my skin is still non-crispy ;)

Probably what I should have said is that *I* plan to do some conversions 
between on-disk and in-memory format for a patch I'm working on, that it's a 
natural thing to do, and that tying the in-memory inode straight to the disk 
buffer interferes with that.  On the other hand, if the direct pointer really 
is a cache win, it would trump the layering issue.
