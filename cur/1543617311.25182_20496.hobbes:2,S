he's talking about licencing issues.
LGPL libc replacements can be used with any program, GPL libc replacements
can only be used with programs licenced in a way that can be combined with
GPL (and the resulting program is GPL.
as an example (not for the boot process, but an example of a replacement
libc use) I use the firewall toolkit, it has been around for a _loooong_
time (in software terms anyway) and has a firly odd licence (free for you
to use, source available, cannot sell it) which is not compatable with the
GPL. with glibc staticly linked this makes huge binaries, with libc5 they
were a lot smaller. I would like to try to use this small libc for these
proxies, but if the library is GPL, not LGPL I'm not allowed to.
