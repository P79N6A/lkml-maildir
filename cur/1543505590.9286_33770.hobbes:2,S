Subject: memory leak while removing inode pages ?

from 2.3.12 sources, it looks like we are not checking for 
page->buffers and returning buffer heads to the unused list while truncating
a file or invalidating inode pages. the offending functions are
remove_inode_page() and invalidate_inode_pages()
