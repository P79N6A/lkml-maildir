AFAICS, the hash-locked refcounting grabs a spin lock for all
operations on the atomic_t. Any reason why that should not be safe ?
Of course, I can't see why we can't have two versions of the
reference counter depending on __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG. Kiran ?

mips64, smp arm ?? ;-)
With a hashed lock, it should not be all that bad in low-end SMPs.
Besides we already use such a thing in gettimeofday implementation
with a global lock. However this is a valid issue and performance #s
from those arch users would be useful.
