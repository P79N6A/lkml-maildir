Yes - already had forgotten about that - thanks for reviving

What do you mean by "floppy as second partition"?

Hmm. get_unaligned() for a single byte?
I see no reason for these two macros.
Also, it is a good habit to parenthesize macro parameters.

I have no objections.
Does it in your case suffice to check for 0 / 0x80 only
(without testing nr_bootable)?
I would prefer to omit that test, until there is at least one
person who shows a boot sector where it is needed.
