I have no idea what Firewire uses, but there are two generic kinds of  
numbers that the IEEE allocates (actually, they're two different views on  
a single id space).
Those are the MAC-48 address used by ethernet, fddi, and various other  
protocols, and the EUI-64 used by more modern designs (and referenced by  
IPv6; in fact, there's an algorithm that lets you create an EUI-64 from a  
MAC-48 via bit stuffing).
Both of these depend on a 24 bit id called company_id or OUI which you can  
buy from the IEEE for US$1.250,00 (for 16 million MAC-48's or 1 trillion  
EUI-64's).
The list of public OUIs is at <URL:
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/
 
oui.txt> (there are "unlisted numbers" in that namespace, too).
Ah, I see IEEE 1394 *does* use OUIs. Not at all surprising, of course.
So, the namespace should be used, not the appliation. In fact, given the  
standard conversion from MAC-48 to EUI-64, we should probably just use one  
namespace for both: my current ethernet card 00:50:FC:0C:63:69 would thus  
be named "eui-64,00:50:fc:ff:ff:0c:63:69".
More than you ever wanted to know about this stuff: <URL:http:// 
standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/>.
Of course, there *are* other namespaces.
