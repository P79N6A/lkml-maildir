The third patch works fine.
When I'm doing "hdparm -c0 /dev/hdc" (16bit I/O) the system respond-ratio gets very low. (with all ide-cd-patches) I can see when gtk draws it's icons... But when I switch I/O back to 32 bit linux gets responsive again and cpu load decreases (~20%).
Tested with 2.4.18-pre3-ac2 and 2.4.17-lowlat-ide.
