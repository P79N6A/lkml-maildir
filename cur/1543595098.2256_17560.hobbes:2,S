True.  Distributed metadata won't solve this problem.  It won't make the
problem any worse, either, so it's a wash on this issue.

What happens now when somebody takes over responsibility for a file
or subsystem and the MAINTAINERS file doesn't get patched, either because
that person forgets to send a MAINTAINERS update or Linus doesn't 
happen to take the MAINTAINERS patch for a while?
What happens when I look at a file and it's not obvious which
subsystem it belongs to?  Sure, I can grovel through MAINTAINERS.  But
how do I know which verbal description matches the function of the
cryptically-commented or uncommented code I have in front of me?
Distributed-information problems need distributed-information
solutions.  Locality is your friend.  This crowd should know that
if anybody should.
