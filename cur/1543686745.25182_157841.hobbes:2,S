I can see no relevance to the kernel here.
With the advent of zone recording only sector size, total
sector count and head count have any meaning and head count
is often false so that other geometry numbers will fit into
specified field sizes.  You cannot fit 255 heads in a half
height 3.5" drive.  Therefore cylinder boundaries are
illusory and should be ignored when partitioning if the
partition table allows LBA addressing.
Partition definition is not a kernel function.  It is user space.
badblocks is, as Andries reports, user space, not kernel.
If you read the manpage for badblocks you will see
       -b block-size
	     Specify the size of blocks in bytes.
So even badblocks doesn't need changing to work with
partitions having (sector_count % 8 != 0).
This sounds like an install script problem to me.
