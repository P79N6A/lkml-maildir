I agree that it's useful behaviour.  However, the change header should
be something like "scsi_error: don't retry for unrecoverable medium
errors" not "infinite retries .."

But, logically, this isn't part of the change set ... the behaviour
you're altering is unrelated to the change set details, so this piece
shouldn't be in.
