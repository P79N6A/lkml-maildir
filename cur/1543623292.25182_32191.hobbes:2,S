rmap is only about making pagout/swapout activities more efficient,
there's no stability issue to solve as far I can tell.

I don't see anything significant to save in that area. During heavy
paging the system load is something like 1/2% of the cpu.

Those numbers also control how aggressive is the swap_out pass. That is
partly a feature I think. Do you plan to unmap and put anonymous pages
into the swapcache when you reach them in the inactive lru, despite you
may have 99% of ram into freeable cache? I think you'll still need some
number/heuristic to know when the lru pass should start to be aggressive
unmapping and pagingout stuff. So I believe this issue about the "number
thing" is quite unrelated to the complexity reduction of the paging
algorithm with the removal of the swap_out pass.
