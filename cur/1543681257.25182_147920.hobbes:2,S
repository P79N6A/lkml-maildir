Subject: [PATCH] IPVS' Kconfig LBLC and LBLCR configuration typo

Hi there!
The following patch fixes what looks like a typo in ipvs' Kconfig
(net/ipv4/ipvs/Kconfig).
Both the IP_VS_LBLC and IP_VS_LBLCR schedulings have the same tristate
line (well, not the same, IP_VS_LBLCR's has a 'g' missing at the end):
tristate "locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling"
But it looks like LBLC should be "locality-based least-connection
scheduling" and LBLCR "locality-based least-connection with replication
scheduling".
Thanks,
		Alberto
