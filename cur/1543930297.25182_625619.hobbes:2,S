That SCSI error code doesn't sound like a reasonable one for the drive 
getting a bad block address. The more typical one in that case would be 
"Logical block address out of range", or maybe the catch-all "Invalid 
field in CDB". "Peripheral device write fault", especially as a deferred 
error (i.e. after the drive already returned a normal completion for the 
data, and then is reporting the failure to actually write to the media 
on the next command), really sounds like a drive problem.
And the kernel is supposed to trap those at the disk layer, like these 
are saying it is, _after_ that error occurs:
Dec  7 04:08:13 chaos kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
