Hi!
Where did you put the config.in entries to ?
This way it would be enabled all the time... okay...
I like that, too.
In the version I set up, I used the config.in entries,
because if you use disable pc_speaker, there is at
least one more int in the kernel. This is surely now much,
but as it is not needed all the time, I thought about choosing it
from menuconfig/config/...
So in short:
less code / one int more in the kernel
or
more code and #ifs / one int less in the kernel
What do you think is better ? I agree that the above one
is nicer code, but in fact I would prefer the second solution.
And what about the code from kernel/sys.c ?
The version you provided doesn't take care of what's
the default value of pcspeaker. This would make it
undefined, which is not really good.
Regards,
Nico
