The NFS protocal may be broken. But Linux has to work with as many
NFS client implementations as possible. That means there should be
no dentry, or anything like pointers to memory or filenames, in
filehandle. filehandle shouldn't change because of reboot, rename
nor hardlink. If we cannot get them all, at least we should try.
Otherwise, we just call it LNFS and tell everyone it is not
interoperatable with most NFS client implementations.
