I notice that everyone carefully avoided addressing this ;)
Oh well, hopefully people are testing with lockdep enabled.  As long
as the fs is put under extreme memory pressure, most bugs should be reported.
Except lockdep doesn't know about journal_start(), which has ranking
requirements similar to a semaphore.  Nor does it know about lock_page().
We already have hard-to-hit but deadlockable bugs in this area.
