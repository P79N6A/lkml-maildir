Subject: Is initrd working?

I was trying to run initrd on 2.5.41, 2.5.42, 2.5.42-mm{1,2}, 2.5.42-ac1 
and it is not working in any case (oopsing just after RAMDISK: Compressed 
image found...). I've sent decoded oops some time ago, without any 
response. I cannot even try modular IDE because of that :/
Please help
