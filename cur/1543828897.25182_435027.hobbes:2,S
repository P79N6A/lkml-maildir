Special treatment of the pages are required. In particular they *must*
be referenced in uncached mode. If something derefences the struct page
in cached mode and the official user of the page does it correctly in
uncached mode one risks memory corruption. It's worse than that in fact
it has to be a full granule of pages that isn't touched like this.
But as Robin pointed out, there just is no real benefit to having a
struct page behind it.
Cheers,
