That probably means the EMC is returning a vendor specific (or perhaps even
a standard) sense code, you'd have to ask EMC specifically what they mean,
and what sense code is returned, or maybe check the logs on your other box
for specifics.
This also means that changing the scsi timeout will have no affect, since
the IO will complete without timing out.
See scsi_error.c scsi_check_sense for how they are handled. One important
piece is that the VENDOR SPECIFIC sense key (value of 9 in
sense_buffer[2]) falls into the default case of SUCCESS (i.e. complete the
IO as failed). Whatever (and if) the code is, you would effectively want
scsi_check_sense to return NEEDS_RETRY rather than SUCCESS.
There is also some range (can't remember what, or where they are in the
SCSI spec) for vendor specific ASC/ASCQ for any (or all?) sense keys.
We don't have a way (2.4 or 2.5) to dynamically (and cleanly) add vendor
specific sense codes and handling of them.

Long enough probably means long enough for any IO to be sent to the EMC.
