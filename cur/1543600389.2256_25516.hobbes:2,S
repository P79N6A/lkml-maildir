The only nit being, every instance Stephan's reported so far,
and in most other reports I've seen, the allocation
has been GFP_ATOMIC (i.e. with mask without __GFP_WAIT).
For non-atomic >0 order allocations we already have some
good logic that does (b) via page_launder(), and
where necessary reclaim_page(),__free_page().
So waiting until we are in the high order allocation
allocation is too late, as we don't have room to move.
I think we need to defragment / avoid fragmentation
BEFORE the GFP_ATOMIC high order allocation comes along.
I have some ideas I'd like to test tonight.
