I tried "mce=nobootlog" and the mce log seems to have disappeared :

Now that you mention it, I always shut down the system from Linux,
because reboot doesn't work(from windows vista 32bit it works). If I
reboot the system from Linux it goes down, but then it enters a cycle
of automatic power down power up(with a beep) and it never stops until
I switch off the power supply.
