I'm not sure what you mean by 24%, since you don't say of what. I'm not
sure what you expect, an old Pentium 133 gives me 6-8Mbit on 10Mbit cards,
with a fair number of rules installed. If you are trying to load up Gbit
with a 386-16 or something, it won't work well, but for typical small
office setups Linux routing seems to run about as fast as directly
connected machines on the same subnet, although there is latency going
through the router.
