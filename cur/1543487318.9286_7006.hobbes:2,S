Is this a bug in the NTFS filesystem driver? I'm running 2.2.2-ac1, and when I
run "wine sol" and then close it, syslogd goes into overdrive logging lots of
the following messages:
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap 0
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: result b3a0f
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap of f90,block 0 is b3a0f
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: super 200
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap 1
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: result b3a10
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap of f90,block 1 is b3a10
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: super 200
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap 2
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: result b3a11
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: bmap of f90,block 2 is b3a11
Feb 25 08:18:54 warthog kernel: super 200
Unfortunately, since this is at work, I can't really spend the time poking
around in the kernel to find the problem, and I can't reproduce it at home, as
I don't have NT installed there.
I have tried vanilla 2.2.2, which oopses when I run wine, and I have also
tried 2.2.2-ac2, but that failed to compile ide-cd.c (as has been pointed
out).
