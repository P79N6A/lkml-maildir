Here is a nice proof that kmsg did become a problem around 2.6.0
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.misc.pape.general/595
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.misc.pape.general/590
It (Gerrit Pape's technique) very defiantly stopped working a few revs
back (2.6.7?). I'm seeing a similar failed read from /dev/rtc and
mplayer with 2.6.10, now too.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/8/226
while read file; do mplayer $file ; done <mediafiles.txt
Failed to open /dev/rtc: Permission denied
for file in `cat mediafiles.txt`; do mplayer $file ; done
works.
