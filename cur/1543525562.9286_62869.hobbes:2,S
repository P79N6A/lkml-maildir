The right thing IMHO is to add a new vector to loop_func_table, still pass
the old absolute block number to the old vector, and use the new with
the relative index when available.

Unfortunately they can not. One design problem of loopback crypto is 
that you cannot store any additional information. The only way to
check if the user entered the right password is to see if ext2 can mount
the file system. There is really no way to detect old and new format.
