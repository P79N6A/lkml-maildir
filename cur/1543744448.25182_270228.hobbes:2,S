I don't think you want to go there. Don't forget in a lot of cases you're
dealing with shared objects, and so you can't just go punching holes in the
middle thereof.

In that case, I'll look at making compound pages mandatory if you wish. I'd
rather avoid doing so because they incur additional overheads, and it'll be on
MMU and !MMU both, but it does make multi-order page handling appear more
robust.
