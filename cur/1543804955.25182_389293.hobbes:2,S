 It really looks useful to me. You don't check for fail because someone has
seen the fail happen. You check for fail in order to have a robust program.
 There are zilions of checks in the kernel and in programs out there which I
think they will never fail. But they are there.
 On the other hand, I'm not going to make too much noise for a such trivial
patch. If you think it's not useful, let's drop it. No problem.
