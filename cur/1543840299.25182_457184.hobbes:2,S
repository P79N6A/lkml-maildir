The standard policy, in place since you began, has been to push core 
stuff into #upstream, and the driver side into #pata-drivers.
That way core changes aren't hidden away in #pata-drivers, and new 
PATA-related code is always compiled -- just like it will be, when the 
PATA drivers are in mainline.
