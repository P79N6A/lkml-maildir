Ok, so what about torques (despite it's still something like FF_RAW or motor
descriptor)? It seems not to be so bad called effect name -- not only
phantom uses torques on motors as an unit of force, for example I get this
by quick googling:
http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/~bouzit/lrp/glove.html
They use there some motors with 14 torque values too, so the phantom isn't
the only device which uses this approach.

Actually there is also a version with 6 motors :).

Better say torques vector. You must compute a torque for each place from the
3d (or bigger) vector of forces in different way for each device that exists
-- this means forces are not independent unit, torques are in the meaning of
layer which doesn't care about what is connected above and below it.

Still, torques are better named raw/motor values, which goes to the device
and I'm sceptic about inventing something class-better than this.
