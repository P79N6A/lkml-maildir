Nonsense. The b,t,l addresses are NOT stable (at least for transports
where the kernel would have to make them up) unless you take an extra
effort to make them stable (like I understand Solaris does). But you
can use the same extra effort to make the /dev entries stable (like
udev does).
				Have a nice fortnight
