Actually in most of the discussion you simply didn't participate.  While
xattrs might not be the nicest interface they have the advantag of not
breaking the SuS assumption of what directories vs files are, and they
do not break the Linux O_DIRECTORY semantics that are defined and need
to solve real-world races either.

For one thing _I_ didn't decide about xattrs anyway.  And I still
haven't seen a design from you on -fsdevel how you try to solve the
problems with files as directories.

My competitors filesystem?  If you look at MAINTAINERS I maintain only
vxfs and sysvfs, neither of which I'd suggest anyone to run their system
on.

Hans, please stop the personal crap or the black helicopters will kidnap
you.   When was the last time you actually worked on kernel namespace
code instead of talking marketing bullshit and ignoring all real world
problems.

Could you pass on that crack pipe please?
