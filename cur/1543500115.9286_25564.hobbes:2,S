Hi!
I don´t  think that it is a good idea to change the behaviour in the
kernel source.
But for you I suppose, you write a module which handles everything with
the immutable flag. When this module is loaded it can handle everything
with this flag.
You can assure that the rmmod process is on a local tty and return EBUSY
or EPERM if it is not.
When you want to make changes to your system, you just 
rmmod immutable.o 
and when you want to make it secure again, type 
insmod immutable.o
So you can control the protection on a local tty and don´t need to hack
the new kernel each time you want to use a new one.
Greetings, Michael
