It could, but nobody had the idea of combining a cooked mode and a raw mode
like DOS provides. OK, DOS did not do a good job, you had to peek the shift
status separately, but you had the assigned character as well as the
(translated) scancode. IIRC, X11 does the same, but with the scancodes
(and the mouse coordinates?) included.
