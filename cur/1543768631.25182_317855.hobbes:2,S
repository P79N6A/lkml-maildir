Well, it really depends on how it is implemented, and what tradeoffs
you make.
Let's say that you don't start deep sleeping until you've backed off
to 64ms rebalancing. Now the CPU power consumption is reduced to less
than 2% of ideal.
Now we don't have to worry about uniprocessor, and SMP systems that
go *completely* idle can have mechanism to indefinitely deep sleep
all CPUs until there is real work.
What you're left with are SMP systems with *some* activity happening,
and of those, I bet most idle CPUs will have other reasons to be woken
up other than the scheduler tick anyway.
And don't forget that the watchdog approach can just as easily deep
sleep a CPU only to immediately wake it up again if it detects an
imbalance.
So in terms of real, system wide power savings, I'm guessing the
difference would really be immesurable.
And the CPU usage / wakeup cost arguments cut both ways. The busy
CPUs have to do extra work in the watchdog case.

Well so does the watchdog, really. But it's probably not like you have
to *really* tune sleep algorithms _exactly_ right, yeah? So long as you
get within even 5% of total theoretical power saving on SMP systems,
it's likely good enough.

I'm think power savings will be unmeasurable between the two approaches,
backoff will be quite a lot less complex, and have less impact on CPUs
that are busy doing real work.
Smells like a bakeoff coming up :)
