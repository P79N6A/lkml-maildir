Okay lets consider this. Now some video cards use different apertures for
their video memory. What I mean the framebuffer location is different for
8 bit (it's little endian) and 16 bit (big endian). Consider this.   
You start your X server in 8 bit mode. Now it will have write access to
/dev/fb. Now you start some app which opens /dev/fb in read only mode and
gets the current fix info. fix->smem_start will point to the little endian
aperture right. Now your X server has properly ALT whatever function keys
that do change the video mode. Since the X server has write access it can
change the modes. So now you switch to 16 bit color mode which means
fix->smem_start has changed to the big aperture. Your other app is still
writing to where the little endian aperture was which is the wrong place.
See even read only mode can hurt you.
