I have a similar system but my problems are different.
I use Andre Hendrick latest UDMA patch for 2.2.12 and ide-scsi for a cd-rom
and cd-rw on the second bus.  I'm getting strange mount problems and irq
time-out resets.  I'm going to try Acer Labs International M15x0 patch
tonight (Australian time) to see if that helps.  Anybody familiar with this
style of problem.
I think its a UDMA/ide-scsi conflict.  But I haven't had time to
investigate.
