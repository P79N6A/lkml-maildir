Not that much. The difference then remains only on a tickless system.

No I2C. LPC is so much faster than I2C (8 MHz 8-bit vs 100 kHz serial).

I'm not proposing polling. I'm proposing that there be a way how to read
the immediate values, in addition to the event notifications. 
Yes, this means polling would be possible.
Reading immediate values is a must, if only to know the values at the
start of your monitoring applet.

How often do you plan to do that? Anyway, the answer is yes, it's not a
big deal to do.

As Dmitry pointed out, all the info (except for the events) is in sysfs,
too.

You need at least 50 Hz for reasonable game control, too. I remember
that analog joysticks sampled at 10 Hz were unusable.
The input layer was designed for input devices that control applications
by actions of the user. The fuzz filtering was designed with that in
mind and is expected to be set once at boot either by an educated guess
of a kernel driver or by the system administrator. Because it's designed
for input devices, it has these properties:
	* It ignores minor noise
	* It slowly reacts to continuous drift of the values
	* It reacts immediately to large changes
This would be likely completely unsuitable for batteries and may be bad
for a drive parking daemon, too. If the daemon can't use it, it'll need
another interface.
