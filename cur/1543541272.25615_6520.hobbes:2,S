(a) GCC has been known to generate worse code for this.  But it's good
    for checking for misuse.  Why do you think the pte structs aren't
    normally used?
(b) iooffset sucks -- you'd use it on nearly every readl/writel call.
    So build it in:
  #ifdef CHECK_IOCOOKIES
  #define readl(iomem, offset) __readl (iomem.addr, offset)
  #else
  #define readl(iomem, offset) __readl ((iomem) + (offset))
#endif
Drivers that use readl(MY_REG_1(dev)) and readl(MY_REG_2(dev))
constructs can still do so.  But whereas before you had:
  #define MY_REG_1(dev)	devinfo[dev]->iobase + 0x10
  #define MY_REG_2(dev)	devinfo[dev]->iobase + 0x14
Now you have:
  #define MY_REG_1(dev)	devinfo[dev]->iobase, 0x10
  #define MY_REG_1(dev)	devinfo[dev]->iobase, 0x14
enjoy,
