You can't just touch a scope-probe to the PCI
clock pin and clip the scope-probe grounding
lead to a convenient "ground" to make these
measurements! You need a special fixture that
will make a low-inductance connection to the
PCI bus in the same manner as the interface chip.
A scope probe will allow you to see if there is
a clock signal. That's all. You can't determine
its quality. A 4-inch ground lead on the scope
probe will result in 10-20% overshoot and undershoot
being observed.
