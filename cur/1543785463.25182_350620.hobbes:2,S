most servers and embedded systems can survive just fine without hotplug 
(in fact hotplug is frequently the slowest part of the boot).
sysfs and netlink I would have to think about, I know I don't expliticitly

I don't think about.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
