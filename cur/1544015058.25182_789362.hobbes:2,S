I don't think that's necessary an universal truth. It 
can be probably fixed.

For most things we don't really need it to be reproducable,
the main exception are the inlines in headers.
Universal noinline would also be a bad idea because of its
costs (4.1% text size increase). Perhaps should make it
a CONFIG option for debugging though.
