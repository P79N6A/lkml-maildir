Let's hope courts see it this way.
But then, why is it that I can't use hardware to stop someone from
copying or modifying the source code, but I can use hardware to stop
someone from copying or modifying the binary?  Or is that not so?
Remember, section 2 talks about modifying *your* *copies* of the
Program, without any reference whatsoever as to whether they're in
source or object form.
