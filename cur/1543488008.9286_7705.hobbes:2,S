So a better solution would be to somewhat 'split' the
counter and task priority concepts, do the task
recalculation only once each eternity (say 3 times a
second) and reschedule with more static priorities,
less often and returning to the same CPU eater after
your editor has released the CPU.
I'll be looking into some schedulers RSN and design
something fun for Linux...
