	There is no problem with MD5 that makes it unsuitable for this particular 
application. A SHA signature would enlarge each packet, further reducing the 
effective MTU. This would increase the cost of what was intended to be a 
simple mechanism to solve a specific problem (spoofed SYNs/RSTs).
	What it comes down to is simply whether you care whether Linux machines can 
interoperate with Cisco's BGP authentication scheme. This feature would be 
very useful to me, so I personally do care, even if the scheme is not the 
best possible scheme.
