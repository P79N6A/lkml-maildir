And this is a problem that has plagues all PC operating systems, but has never
been a problem on the Macintosh.  Why?  Because the Mac was designed to handle
this problem, but the PC never was.
The Mac never enumerates its devices like the PC does (no C: D: etc, no
/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, or anything like that).  It also remembers the boot device
in its EEPROM (the Startup Disk Control Panel handles this).
The only way to solve this problem is the DESIGN IT INTO THE OS!  Someone needs
to stand up and say, "This is a problem, and I'm going to fix it."  There needs
to be a "device mount order database" or some kind, and all the disk drivers
need to access that database to determine where to put the devices it finds.
The only problem is BIOS boot.  That information is, I believe, stored in the
ESCD, but I don't know if it's reliable enough and complete enough to be usable
by Linux.
