Actually this list is not about Linux tuning. Please read post only 
about bugs and patches for the linux kernel.
Anyway, I guess what you are looking for is the "swappiness". For more 
info check 
http://www.brunolinux.com/06-Fine_Tuning_Your_System/Swappiness.html
Am I correctly understanding that you are using your video card memory 
as a place to put swap? This sounds quite cool, how have you done this? 
Is there a driver which can report the video ram as a block device?
see you,
Eric
