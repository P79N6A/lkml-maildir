Re: BIOS disables CPUSs.
It would be good to verify that 2.4.21 still works properly on this box
to verify the hardware isn't hosed.  Also, if your BIOS CMOS has error
logs, it might be good to read them to see what it is thinking.
Also, does the same 3-cpu configuration result when you boot 2.6?
Thanks,
