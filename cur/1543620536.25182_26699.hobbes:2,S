I dont like that attitude. I have a system that has been 'dead' for a while
(its now 15 years old), and I'm 're'-porting linux to it (Acorn A400).
Linux is meant to be fun, not just 'latest X86 crap'.
Not to say that we should restrict anything for old hardware, but it doesnt
hurt to spare a thought for it. Doing so may even encourage people to write
better code.
