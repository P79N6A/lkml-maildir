Hi Brian,
The solution is here:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2007-11/msg06482.html
You just need to run "alsactl -F restore" to force restoration of your
previous settings.  This needs to be done while /etc/asound.state consists
of your settings that work correctly under your previous kernel.
Hopefully Fedora hasn't already overwritten /etc/asound.state, I actually
manually run alsactl from /etc/rc.local and disable the alsa service just
to prevent my settings from being overwritten.
If your settings have already been overwritten, you may need to boot into
the old kernel, get it working, save the alsamixer settings (alsactl
store), reboot to the new kernel, then run "alsactl -F restore".  A
hassle, I know.
You might want to report this bug to the Fedora bug tracking system -- in
my opinion these kind of changes should not be made just for a minor
kernel update.
I also wonder if it is even possible to get digital output working under
newer kernels without an existing asound.state -- I tried in vain for
hours to get it working again by just using alsamixer, and I wasn't
getting anywhere.  asound.state consists of 225 controls for my SB Live,
and only 40 or so are exposed in alsamixer.  I wonder if alsamixer isn't
exposing the necessary control to enable digital output under newer
kernels.
