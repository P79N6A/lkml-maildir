After some heavy compile hours, here are the results:
- 2.6.13.1 and 2.6.13.2 behave the same way with the same config.
For reference I now published the configs [0]. 2.6.12.5 was the config
source, all others where generated using make oldconfig.
Perhaps there's a somehow heavy configuration mistake in it?
Btw, Daniel Aubry fixed his keyboard problem with disabling usb keyboard support
in the bios (is this really the right way?).
