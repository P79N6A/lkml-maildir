This is used by radeonfb and aty128fb at least... though only on ppc for
now... It could be used later in fbdev's for "optisation". Basically, a
trylock semantic on the console semaphore, allows you to try to do
something right away (irq time), but defer if not possible. I use it in
some low level PowerMac PM code.
