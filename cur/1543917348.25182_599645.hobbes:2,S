rootfs is mounted by init_mount_tree, and curret->fs is set up for init
there aswell.  This is called by mnt_init, which is called by
vfs_caches_init, which is called by start_kernel far before we go to
rest_init which finally creates a thread to call kernel_init which then
calls do_basic_setup which calls do_initcalls to initialize drivers and
afterwards runs the initrd/initramfs.
While the actual function names in main.c changed quite a bit we've
initialized the initial namespace very early on since the 2.5 days.
