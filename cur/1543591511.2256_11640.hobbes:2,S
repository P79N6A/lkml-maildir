What about a sysctl for that? Choose decent steps and let 0
(which is an insane value) mean "let's kernel decide" and make
this default.
In the past we could do this by adjusting some watermarks in
/proc/sys/vm but now, we can't do anything but trust the genius
kernel developers.
I doubt that we can test all kinds of workload and even imagine
what pervert stuff some people do with their machines.
Tuning _is_ manual work. Always has been and always will be.
This countinously "I know it better then you" is what I hated
about Windows and now this comes more and more into Linux :-(
Rik: Would you take patches for such a tradeoff sysctl?
