This _SHOULD_ correspond on each linux instalation. But if you would
distribute a binary to other people it's a problem.
(note that I'm running an rc script, which sets the symlink /usr/src/linux
properly at boottime ... this should be everywhere)
There is also one way how to guess HZ - calibrate :-)))
Recently I've done more difficult thing - I not only guess the HZ value, I
also guess the time when the tick comes. But it uses a bit of statistics and 
may be inaccurate on loaded systems. And you need TSC :-)
