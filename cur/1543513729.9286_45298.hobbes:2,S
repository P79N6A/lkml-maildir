This has been discussed quite extensively on debian-devel. Apparently,
SuS (Single-Unix Specification) says that echo must not accept any
parameters.
To be honest, I'd say that SuS stinks on this one, but it's a fact
non-the-less.
So either we specificy what shells can be used, or we'll have to rewrite
the echo-statement(s) in some way (printf?).
