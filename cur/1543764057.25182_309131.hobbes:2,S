Are there many kernels still being built with 2.95.4? It's quite 
antiquated, as far as
i'm aware.
The use of '__' violates compiler namespace. If 2.95.4 were not easily 
replaced by
a much better version (3.3.x? 3.4.x) I would see a reason to disregard 
this, but a fix
merely to satisfy an obsolete compiler?
In my humblest of opinions you are fixing a bug that is better solved 
by  downloading
a more recent version of gcc.
