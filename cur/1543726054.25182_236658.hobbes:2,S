I'd hope that kswapd was carefully to make sure that it always has
enough pages...
...it is harder to do the same auditing with userland program.

Yes, something like that would be neccessary. I believe it would be
slightly more complicated, like
"NFS server needs > 10MB *and working kswapd*", so you'd need 25MB in
fact... and this info should be stored in some readable form so that
it can be checked.
