Yes that's what I thought. And we don't really need to worry about this
case because filemap_nopage has to deal with it anyway (ie. we shouldn't
see a locked !uptodate page in do_no_page).

Yes, but in that case they're still going to hit the tree_lock anyway, and
if they do have a chance of synching up, the cacheline bouncing from count
and mapcount accounting is almost as likely to cause it as the lock_page
itself.
I did a nopage microbenchmark like you describe a while back. IIRC single
threaded is 2.5 times *more* throughput than 64 CPUs, even when those 64 are
faulting their own NUMA memory (and obviously different pages). Thanks to
tree_lock.
