LOCK just means the x86 "lock" prefix.
incl is the 32-bit version of "inc" (incremement)
You want to return the variable?  Try this:
static __inline__ unsigned long atomic_inc(atomic_t *v)
{
    __asm__ __volatile__(
        LOCK "incl %0"
        :"=m" (v->counter)
        :"m" (v->counter));
    return v->counter;
}
