I know what you mean, but right now it's far easier hacking the
kernel than libc, at least if running a uml-kernel ;)
Anyways, I booted my patch but I don't know if it's working, because
I've got no test machine to try it on... but, it didn't freak out
so I think it works :)))
As for the libc patch, I think it can be easier to make an
exec-prefault.so library and LD_PRELOAD it, at least for testing
purposes.
If you could tell me the locking is right, I might try patching my
physical machine 2.4.19-ck4 with the kernel patch just to see if it
works.
