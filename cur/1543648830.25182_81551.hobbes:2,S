Nope so far, as per Ulrich's word, this was one of the things that
held it out; same thing for NGPT. With this I can implement "more"
true real-time in NGPT.

Yep - error paths should be ok, but your are right, I don't want to
waste atomic memory. Heavily locked applications might exhaust it.
I'll check that out.
