Subject: [patch 0/8] uml: some fixes for 2.6.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Now I'm sending some other fixes intended for 2.6.12... they are either very 
simple or potentially critical (as the PREEMPT_ACTIVE fix). Some of these 
are/were still in -mm queue, but since they seem to have been dropped and 
anyway haven't been merged, I'm resending them anyway.
Also, we have one big 2.6.10 regression which is still unfixed: top always 
shows ksoftirqd/0 as runnable, while it gets 0% cpu time, and loadavg goes 
then to 1.0, while no real load is generated...
Possible culprits could be the IRQ code rewrite, maybe; I've not found what 
the hell can be arch-specific for this (except that UML does not support 
PREEMPT and that SMP, and locking in general, isn't well tested yet, even if 
the biggest problems are just theoretical, luckily).
I've not yet had the time to analyze it successfully (but while looking at 
this I saw the PREEMPT_ACTIVE problem, which also extends to other archs, see 
my other mail).
