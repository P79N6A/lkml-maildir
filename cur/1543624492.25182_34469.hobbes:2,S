Note that this is a perfect example of the tangle-of-states problem we
discussed on IRC.  This problem comes up because of the uholy way in
which pages and buffers are tangled together (page->buffer->page...).
The solution imho is to get rid of buffer_heads and divide their
current functionality between struct page and struct bio.
Cleaning up the state mess is just one of the reasons for doing it, of
course, but it's not all that unimportant.
