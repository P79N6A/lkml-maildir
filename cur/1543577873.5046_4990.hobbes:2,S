Hi Dave,
don't you think the writepage file operation is rather hackish?
I'd much prefer Ben La Haise's rw_kiovec [1] operation, it is more
generic (supports read and write) and should be easily usable for
zerocopy networking with plain old write (using map_user_kio).
Besides that the FS crew thinks it should go in soon because of
aio anyway...

[1] for those that don't know yet, the prototype is:
	rw_kiovec(struct file * filp, int rw, int nr,
		struct kiobuf ** kiovec, int flags,
		size_t size, loff_t pos);

Whip me.  Beat me.  Make me maintain AIX.
