No, the linker simply can not assume that this information is present. 
That's a limitation of ELF.  The right way to do this sort of
optimization is to compile every function into its own section and then
handle the (very small) performance cost of doing so by a relaxation
pass in the linker.  You can't safely remove any part of an input
section, no matter what relocation information you think you have.
