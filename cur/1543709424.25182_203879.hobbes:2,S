Hi everybody!
I hope that i can steal enough of your precious time to get
your attention for a patch that adds hard real time support
to the linux kernel (worst case response time below
5 microseconds at a 100 KHz periodic interrupt).
The proposed "real time interrupt patch" enables the linux
kernel for hard-real-time applications such as data aquisition
and control loops by adding priorities to interrupts and spinlocks.
New festures since first release
--------------------------------
* ported to 2.6 (tested with 2.6.2 and 2.6.3)
* io-apic priority operation partly implemented
* enhanced example application
* performed benchmarks
The following document will describe the patch in detail and how
to install it:

The patch and a demo application can be downloaded from:

Comments are highly appreciated!
best regards
Bernhard Kuhn
