Your legal people are idiots...You must make available the source
of what you ship.

Ah the crux of the problem...legal people invent problems for a living.
What could they possibly have been thinking?

Too bad you rolled over on this.  Would have been better to duke it out
with legal right up front.
On a constructive note...maybe you could try telling legal that it's risky
and irresponsible to to ship developmental kernel code with little testing
and you should stick to stable production sources.  "Current" doesn't mean
pre-production.
good luck,
jeff
