This can already occur worst case when we spin on an IPI (eg a cross CPU
TLB shootdown)
If the INT3 is acknowledged as safe by intel either as is or by some
specific usage like lock mov then great. If not it isn't too bad a
problem.
And to be real about this - how many benchmarks do you know that care
about mega-kernel-debugs per second ?
