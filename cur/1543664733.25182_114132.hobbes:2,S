I think that at the beginning of 2.5.x series there was some thinking
about removing end_that_request* completely from the API. As it never
happened, and __end_that_request_first()/end_that_request_last() has 
definitely better quality (like that it does not ignore req->waiting...)
than opencoded nbd loop, I prefer using end_that_request* over opencoding
bio traversal.
If you want, then just replace blk_put_request() with __blk_put_request(),
instead of first change. But I personally will not trust such code, as 
next time something in bio changes nbd will miss this change again.
