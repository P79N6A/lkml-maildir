I have a PC with an Athlon CPU, which has problems with newer kernel-versions. (see lspci-output below)
If I want to boot current Knoppix or Mandrake 8.2beta3 install cds (both based on kernel 2.4.17), it says:
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:05
It worked fine with the older mandrake 8.1 with kernel 2.4.8.
Any ideas? How can I help to fix this?
