But independent of the version/patchlevel, which was the point of shipping it.
If CML2 is adopted and I become the config system maimtainer,
symbolreplace is one of a number of small tools I'll drop into the scripts

symbols, power tools are needed.  Even just garbage-collecting unused
symbols isn't trivial.
