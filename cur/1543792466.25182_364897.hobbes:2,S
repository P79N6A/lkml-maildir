I understand that some people need to use attachment for
patches.  In some locations I have that problem myself.
However, the From: in the body above isn't needed.
Or if it's needed, it should be part of the patch.
And the patch (attachment) also contains From:, but it's missing
a Signed-off-by: line.
Please read/study Documentation/SubmittingPatches, esp. the
section on "12) The canonical patch format".
Anyone:  what are acceptable method(s) for using
attachments for patches?
Would no email body be OK?  (I.e., everything in the attachment?)
Everything being "the canonical patch format."
Thanks,
