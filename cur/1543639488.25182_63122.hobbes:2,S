Hi Jens,
	The following trivial fix has been in my kernel tree for
ages.  It is need for the C compiler to compile statements like
the following, which I use in my version of loop.c:
	BLK_DEFAULT_QUEUE(MAJOR_NR)->queuedata = NULL;
	Could you please apply it to your tree and forward it to
Linus (or let me know if you'd prefer to handle it some other way).
