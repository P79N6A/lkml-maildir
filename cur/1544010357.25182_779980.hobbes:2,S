It does, and panics (disables itself). I think if this happens it is a
kmemleak bug and some hook is missing or added twice.

No. This memleak_alloc() callback was mainly added to avoid plenty of
false reports from various parts of the kernel (especially the IPv4
stack). It wasn't really meant to track the allocated hash blocks.
