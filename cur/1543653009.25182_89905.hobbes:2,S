Wouldn't it then seem reasonable to remove things from the kernel that
have been broken for a long time, and no one seems to care enough to fix?
I know of at least one driver (IOmega Buz v4l) that seems to have fallen
into disrepair possibly since before 2.4.0, and as far as I know has not
been repaired since then.
