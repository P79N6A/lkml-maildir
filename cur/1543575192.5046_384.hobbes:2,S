One option, if there's no bespoke mechanism is to use DPorbes and or Linux
Trace Toolkit to set up a trace of file system apis. You could also start
with strace.

Subject:  who is writing to disk
Hello,
I found a process constantly writing to disk when I run gnome as desktop
and while the whole system is idle.  I don't find anything in the log
file, and I don't see anything updated in my home dir or in /tmp.  Does it
sound like bdflush is writing?  But I don't hear the disk access when I
am not running gnome.
My question then is, is there a (monitoring) tool that can tell me who is
writing to disk?  Or how I configure the kernel to know that?
Thanks!
Joe
