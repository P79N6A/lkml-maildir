           Summary: FTP NAT doesn't work in 2.6.0-test1
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test1
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: laforge@gnumonks.org
         Submitter: pavelr@coresma.com
Distribution: Red Hat 9
Hardware Environment: 
Software Environment: gcc-3.3
Problem Description:
Both IP masquerading and SNAT do not work with FTP. When I issue dir command,
ftp connection gets stuck. In ethernet sniffer I see a lot of TCP ack packets
going in both directions. Both FTP client and server are Win2k boxes. 
Steps to reproduce:
Setup a NAT box
modprobe ip_nat_ftp
modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE (assuming eth0 is an
external interface)
Try ftp connection.
This setup works fine with RedHat kernel 2.4.20-18.9.
