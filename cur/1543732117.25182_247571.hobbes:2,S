  My first thought would change the API that cp uses to copy the file.
  But  in  an earlier response on this message thread I have found out
  that  there is no such API (well there is, but it is linked into the
  program)  and  cp  in fact itself is doing the copying. this is also
  what  I  objected  against  before. It is a bad design and should be
  attended  much  higher  interest to change than just adding adding a
  new type of file-as-dir.

  Yes. This seem to be an acceptable way to do things. But next time
  someone comes and want to do changes like this we need to start
  patching things again. If there was an API that was separate from
  the programs then new features could be included much more easily as
  things could be done behind the scenes. ie the "cp fileA fileB"
  would succeed and all the extended attributes, metas, streams etc
  would be copied too. Nothing would ever be lost unless copying to a
  filesystem that doesn't support the special stuff. (as with NTFS
  file streams).
