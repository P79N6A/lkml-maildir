Hello all,
I have kernel verison 2.2.14-12 version with RH6.2.
I do "cd /sbin" and i see "depmod" there in the /sbin
directory. But somehow seems like load module is not
working. Maybe this is the reason why system freezes happen
in my RH. A driver for a custom built pci card is not
loaded properly. Maybe i should do "/sbin/modprobe pci.driver"
manually or put it in my rc.local file. Please clarify if possible.
Thanks in advance.
J
