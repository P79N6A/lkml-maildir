For those drivers that use schedule() calls currently to delay, what
would you recommend? drivers/atm/ambassador.c contains a few examples.
I can get rid of most of the schedule_timeout() calls, but the
schedule() ones are a little more difficult. Would schedule_timeout(1)
be preferred to schedule()?
