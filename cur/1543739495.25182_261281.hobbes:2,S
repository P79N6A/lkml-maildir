thanks. Could you send me the full successful bootlog of -U4 with
PREEMPT_REALTIME disabled (but otherwise the same .config)?
this looks suspicious:
eth0: -- ERROR --
        Class:  internal Software error
        Nr:  0x1ae
        Msg:  General: Driver release date not initialized
eth0: -- ERROR --
        Class:  internal Software error
        Nr:  0x1ae
        Msg:  General: Driver release date not initialized
eth0: 3Com Gigabit LOM (3C940)
eth0: network connection down
      PrefPort:A  RlmtMode:Check Link State
is this normal? Could the stall simply be a bootup stall due to no
network available?
