Subject: [PATCH 0/38] KVM: Decouple Intel VT implementation from base kvm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This patchset prepares kvm for multiple architecture implementations.  
The kvm.ko module is split into kvm.ko and kvm-intel.ko, and a function 
vector is used to dispatch arch specific operations to the arch module.
