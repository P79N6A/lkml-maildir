if it is, it seems to be the way reiserfs uses it, and not a general issue
of the driver itself. i don't really think this is a hardware problem,
unless anyone can give me a convincing reason why it should/could be.

i'll try, though i'm not really eager to get my files corrupted. so i think
i'll just copy some files from the old to the new drive and diff them to see
if they get corrupted with a plain 2.4.17 kernel. if they do, any ideas how
to track it down further?
