hi.
I loved 2.3.39, but then after 2.3.4x apps started
crashing....
#1 I see "unable to handle paging request"  errors
#2 For 2.3.40/41 some apps crash with kernel oops.
Other programs remain up and running. but
intermittently i see some crashes.
K6/II (3dnow) 333 
running X 3.3.5 {suse6.3} GNOME  {suse6.3}
and netfilter x.17 for IP masq.
-------------------------------------
I am enclosing the syslog entry about the Oops.
Any help is appreciated. Let me know if anyone needs
more information tracking this down.
