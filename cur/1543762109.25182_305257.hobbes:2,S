Patch the kernel?
There's no way of doing this apart from unmount/mount, or by forcing a ton
of memory pressure and hoping that the dentries get reclaimed.
A quick way of doing it would be to add a new mount option to the
filesystem and call shrink_dcache_sb() from there.  do `mount -o
remount,shrink_dcache'.
