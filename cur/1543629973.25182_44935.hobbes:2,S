    In many current distributions (e.g. from Red Hat, Mandrake and Caldera)
    they do.
Yes, distributions are known to introduce buggy patches.
Moreover, distributions are known to copy each others bugs.
Sometimes I tell one distribution that a patch is buggy,
and they revert their patch, but some months later they
have it again, copied from some other distribution.
Even bad "segmentation fault" bugs are copied.
But for 2.5 this is not important. Distributions have time
to fix stuff before 2.6.
