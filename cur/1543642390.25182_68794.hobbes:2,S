I've had a look now. I concur that e2fs at least is full of assumptions
that it has various different sorts of metadata in memory at all times.
I can't rewrite that, or even add a "warning will robinson" callback to
vfs, as I intended. What I can do, I think, is ..
.. simply do a dput of the fs root directory from time to time, from
vfs - whenever I think it is appropriate. As far as I can see from my
quick look that may cause the dcache path off that to be GC'ed. And
that may be enough to do a few experiments for O_DIRDIRECT.
Is that (approx) correct?
Peter
