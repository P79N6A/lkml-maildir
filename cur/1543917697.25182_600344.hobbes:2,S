Hmmm...  I think most current non-driver-model sysfs users are deep in
kernel anyway, but I think not exporting sysfs interface at all might be
a bit too restrictive.  I think we need to examine the current
non-driver-model sysfs users thoroughly to determine what to do about
this.  But, yes, I do agree that we need to put restrictions one way or
the other.

I think it would be better if namespace comes after interface update and
other new features, especially symlink renaming, but, under the current
circumstance, it might delay namespace unnecessarily and I have no
problem with your patches going in first.  My concerns are...
* Do you think you can use new rename implementation contained in this
series?  It borrows basic ideas from the implementation you used for
namespace but is more generic.  It would be great if you can use it
without too much modification.
* I'm still against using callbacks to determine namespace tags because
callbacks need to be coupled with sysfs internals more tightly and are
more difficult to grasp interface-wise.

Ah... Coming few months will be fun, won't they?  :-)
