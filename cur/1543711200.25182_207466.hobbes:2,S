just wanna know if somebody has the same problem as me.
i' m running an amd xp 3000+ on an epox board with nforce2-chipset. everything 
was alright til i changeed from kernbel 2.6.3 to 2.6.4 3 days ago. since then 
my cpu-temperature rised to 60-65 degrees, sometimes 73 degrees (while 
compiling) and pc powered himself down then.
i took my old config-files and did not change anything.
last night i upgraded to 2.6.5-rc1 and everything is running normal as 
before..
