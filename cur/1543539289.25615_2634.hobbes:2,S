 Although there are many different genre of 'realtime', the fundamental
factor is deterministic behavior such that a running thread or process
shall not be pre-empted except by an interrupt, or a higher priority
thread/process being marked 'runnable' (generally by an ISR via
semaphore/mutex release).  This is vital to ensure a system can keep up
with hardware and data flow that cannot be allowed to 'miss' a critical
timing deadline.
 Everything else just boils down to implementation differencess.
 Fault tolerance is another issue entirely...
