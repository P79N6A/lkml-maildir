There is a very simple reason why Linux shouldn't have a "bootscreen" - 
its a lame idea. We have copied enough of the bad "features" of Windows et 
al into Linux already, IMHO.
FWIW, I usually remove the graphics from LILO/GRUB config as installed by 
default these days.
Most of the machines I maintain are very seldom rebooted, but if someone 
was to do a reboot, I would want them to be able to observe any errors or 
other abnormal output from the boot-up process. A "bootscreen" makes it 
more likely that such an error message would be more likely to go 
unnoticed - and, if they became commonplace, may eventually result in 
developers making the on-boot output less verbose/informative/etc, on the 
basis that it isn't likely to be seen in the first place!
The stuff you see on your screen when your Linux installation boots up 
weren't put there for no reason. Please lets leave them there!
