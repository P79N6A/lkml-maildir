One might think that, but it isn't true.  That'll just stop the kernel from
halting immediately when it doesn't find any tsc capability.  The system
still locks up -- maybe some other parts of the kernel tries to use tsc?
I never looked into it as compiling the kernel correctly (sans tsc) works
just fine.
On a side note, has anyone seen dd scrolling behavior with video chipse
using shared memory?  On the geode board I'm playing with, the screen
never scrolls correctly.  It's probablly something stupid in the 5530's
setup that's at fault. (I have ever intention of turning the VGA port
off entirely.)
