	I "guarantee" you that the reason for the segmentation fault
is a memory allocation failure because the infinitely recursive
invocations (modprobe -> syslog -> wants unix sockets -> modprobe).
	You are probably missing the following line from /etc/conf.modules:
alias net-pf-1 unix
	I just tried "modprobe -s an_unknown_module", and indeed it
does try to log the failed request for an unknown module via syslog.
If you already have that net-pf-1 line in your /etc/conf.module, you
might want to try this:
mv /sbin/modprobe /sbin/modprobe.real
cat > /sbin/modprobe << EOF
#!/bin/sh
echo "$*" >> /tmp/modprobe.log
EOF
reboot
	This will put a list of the modules that the kernel is
tring to load in /tmp/modprobe.log.
