OK, just for completeness, this issue has been resolved.
In my BIOS, there was an option:
PCI IRQ  (edge/level)
It was set to 'edge'.  Setting to 'level' fixed the problem - the 
8139too.c driver is perfectly OK (I am now on 2.6.4 with no 
problems).
I would like to thank OGAWA Hirofumi for the time and debugging code 
he done for me, and also successfully pinpointing the problem and 
giving me an idea of what was going on and what to look for to fix 
it.
Thank you!
Nick
