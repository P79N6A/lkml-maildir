I've found six compile errors in -pre2 with gcc 3.4 I'll send patches 
for.
There are still tons of warnings for lvalues and a few other warnings, 
but I don't see a pressing need to fix these:
They are not a real problem with gcc 3.4, and whether gcc 3.5 will ever 
be supported as compiler for kernel 2.4 is a question whose answer lies 
far in the future.
