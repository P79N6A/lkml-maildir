	Following myself, I found that version 1.06 works correctly
	with my setup. Could the driver be integrated in the main
	tree ? (I guess the answer will be : it's up to Donald to
	provide the new drivers to Linus :-)
	As a side question, not related to l-k, could someone give
	me some indication on how regenerating a proper RH 6.1
	bootable image once I have recompiled the kernel-2.2.12-20.src.rpm
	package ? (ie, how running the different mkboot, mkinitrd,
	updmodules, etc. scripts found on the install RH 6.1 CD).
	Thanks in advance,
A+,
