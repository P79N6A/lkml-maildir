OK, applied your one-liner above with PREEMPT.

The above was on reiserfs and happened on the very first pull.
Attaching the source of saga.c for reference.
So, what next doc?  Back out that one-liner and try your vmtruncate?
Or try Chris' patch for reiserfs?
At the moment I'm testing on ext3, which survived the two pull/unpulls.  
This is like watching paint dry.
I'll do some more bk unpull and bk pull cycles until this breaks on ext3.
