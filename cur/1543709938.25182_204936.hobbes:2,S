Dear All,
 is it advisable to apply both preempt-kernel-rml and low-latency patches
for 2.4.18 kernel.
for 2.4.18 kernel I applied the following patches .
1. 2.4.18-pre9-low-latency.patch
2. preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-5.patch
After booting Linux with the above patches if I load ATM driver the kernel
is panic
and it is showing in sched.c line 580 . Is there any other patch I have to
apply  or any 
sequence  i.e. first low latency and then preempt kernel or vise versa ..
Thanks and Regards
Suresh K
