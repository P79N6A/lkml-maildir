I realize this question must get asked alot, but I need to know the answer.
How can I boot up Linux wihout the kernel switching to graphics mode?
I never did this is 2.0.x kernals. Do I need to recompile it with special 
settings?
Maybe I can use an option with loadlin? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
