DTR/DSR is a very often used handshake for serial printers, at least
in the POS field. A lot of supermarket cash registers are in fact PCs
with special hardware, which for some unclear reason typically knows
only about DTR/DSR handshaking (even if it is from other vendors:
SNI or EPSON does not make a difference: only DTR/DSR).
Sending people to a thousand stores around the country putting special
cables between printers and computers is simply not acceptable (if you
know POS service people, you know that about half of the cables would
be put on the wrong serial ports).
This patch is very small and you should be able to easily see any side
effects it might have.
hope you change your mind,
Martin
