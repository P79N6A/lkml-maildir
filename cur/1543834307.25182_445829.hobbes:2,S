Definitely yes. The problem is to figure out what "one" is.
I already posted what I considered one logical change in this case and 
why I did: It's an idiomatic makeover of k*alloc calls without change in 
functionality. What breaks my counting of "one" is that unwritten rules 
about preferred idioms (are said to) override written rules.
