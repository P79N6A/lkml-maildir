bugzilla.redhat.com is a good first start.
Hmm. I just realized that I was also running my script on a plain vanilla 
2.4.20 kernel, NOT rh9's own kernel, so that's probably why I couldn't 
reproduce the problem. I'll try again tonight, but as you said this points 
strongly towards some new RH kernel feature which is less than stable or 
which modifies certain semantics in ways that occasionally break amd.
