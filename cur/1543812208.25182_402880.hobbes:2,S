Thank you for your input.
I agree that "common configs" are the most important ones, but I also
feel that problems need to be fixed in general no matter how "corner
case" or "trivial" or "uncommon" they may be.
I ran an experiment, I reported the results. And from the comments in
this thread and what I've also recieved privately I think I achieved
my goal of getting more bugs fixed :)
I personally fixed some of the warnings.
Other people fixed other warnings and errors as a result of my post.
People got thinking about these things.
All in all I think that's a good result :-)
