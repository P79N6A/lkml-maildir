Well, in all honesty, I don't think I really said "valid", but that I said 
that some crazy people want to do it, and that we should try to allow them 
their foibles.
So I'd be nervous to do any _guarantees_. I think that good VM policies 
should make it be something that works in general (the dirty mapping 
limits in particular), but I'd be a bit nervous about anybody taking it 
_too_ seriously. Crazy people are still crazy, they just might be right 
under certain reasonably-well-controlled circumstances.
