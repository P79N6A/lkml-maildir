I don't think this is right. When we unplug a device, we're unplugging it 
whether it is unused or not, and pci_remove_device_safe() is the wrong 
thing. It should use the "remove_behind_bridge()" thing, so I think 
Russell's patch is closer to working, but that one looked like it will 
certainly corrupt memory with any multi-function device, so I really would 
want to see something that has actually been tested too.
