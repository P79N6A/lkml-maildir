The safest thing to do at this point is to simply delete the whole thing:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb count=1
then pvcreate the disk again.  If you already have data on the PV in
question, you can "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1 seek=510 count=2"
to remove only the partition signature.
Note also that it is a bug in LVM that it did not zero the whole thing
in the first place.
Cheers, Andreas
