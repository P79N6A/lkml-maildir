I should have given all the information about my setup.
Asus A7M266-D with two Athlon MP 1900+'s (running at 1.6GHz) with
2GB registered DDR at 133MHz.
Ethernet IntelPro 100 working fine with IRQ19.
The ASUS BIOS version 1.005a.
SuSE-7.3.
XFree86-4.2.0-??.i386.rpm produced by SuSE recently.
Checked with two graphics cards  NVidia GeForce 2MX and Matrox
G400.  Those two boards worked fine on a Intel-P4 machine.
This means that I keep XF86Config files for the respective
boards perfectly working on the Intel P4.
I guess that is all.
THank you.
