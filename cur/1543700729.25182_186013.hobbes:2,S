Ummm...  there are many changes to the pcmcia net drivers in my 
net-drivers-2.5-exp queue.  All can be classified as fixes, to a greater 
or lesser degree, and I would put those at a higher priority than API 
cleanups and such.  Mainly patches from Russell King and Al Viro, but 
also some random fixes from lkml.
For the net drivers, please coordinate with me (and perhaps Russell 
King), otherwise it will turn into an even bigger mess.
My latest patchkits are always posted at
