whoops, that should have read 'remount ro' .. xfs_repair on a live and
writable filesystem is of course inviting desaster. I was trying read
only - btw, the system as such is booted via PXE and running complete
out of an initrd, using the HDD just for local data storage - not much
happening on shutdown/reboot either way.

I basically build a PXE image which does an xfs_repair -L /dev/sda2 from
initrd - and the problem persists. Sigh. Exactly no change.

okay ... it happens on several of the dozens of machines I'm running
this way, but not on others - I have yet to find the difference.
what can I do to help find the problem?
