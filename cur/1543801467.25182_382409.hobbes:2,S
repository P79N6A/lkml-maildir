Just did. Reverted that one patch, then rebuild/reinstalled the kernel
(with the same .config) and booted it - no change. It still locks up
in the exact same spot.
X starts & runs fine (sort of) since I can play around at the kdm
login screen all I want, it's only once I actually login and KDE
proper starts that it locks up.
