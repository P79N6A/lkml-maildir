Even assuming all segments are attached at the same virtual address on all MM
(this can be enforced with MAP_FIXED of course), we can't use the same tlb
entries for accessing the same shared sement from different MM. That's not even
possible on hardware with address space numbers (on x86 it's obvious it's not
possible even with future x86 chips that can tag the TLB entries
with the phisical address of the pgd to skip the full tlb flush during
switch_mm).
I think the main point of using threads instead of shared mappings is
performance.
