From a quick read:
- Impressive lack of code comments!
- The /proc entries seem to be undocumented.
- There are several uses of `volatile' in the driver.  Usually this is
  either unnecessary or indicates a deeper problem.  Are they needed?
- Why is mmap setting VM_SHM?
- hpet_alloc() leaks `hpetp' on error paths
-
