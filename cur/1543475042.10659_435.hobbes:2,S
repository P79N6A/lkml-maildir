1. Don't compile Unix98 as a module (although it should work, it is a
   highly discouraged configuration -- the modular option is mainly for
   testing, as the modularity overhead is significant.)
2. Unix98 ptys are allocated in blocks of 256.  If you pick a number
   that is not a multiple of 256 it will round up.  In your case 32->256.
