Its raising the irq but its never getting seen - as if it jammed

I did a ton of work. The 8390 driver is believed rock solid on SMP. It does
do a lot of enable/disable irq stuff so a bug there would explain it if
it somehow confused the irq controller.
However you note that restarting the driver fixes it. That might be worth
playing with - if free/request_irq pairs clean it then we know whats up.
If a chip reset fxes it we also have an idea
