Subject: 2.3.40pre6 on P2 UP: Massive FS corruption on ext2

I have seen this with all 2.3.x kernels since I got my P2 machine (intel
SE440BX motherboard with updated BIOS, 128Mb RAM), which was 2.3.20.
Symtoms include files transformed into directories, massive amounts of
duplicate blocks (usually between an innocent file and a newly created one,
while e.g. compiling a kernel).  Haven't seen corrupted files per se (but
the files with duplicate blocks do get screwed). Several compilers
(egcs-1.1.2-24, gcc-2.95.2, egcs snapshots) and binutils on Red Hat 6.0 and
6.1. e2fsck from 1.18 doesn't find weird devices and files with weird
lengths, permissions and owners/groups anymore, which certainly is an
advance...
Machine is rock solid with 2.2.15pre, memtest86-2.1 didn't find anything
either.
Has anybody else seen anything like this? Any clues? Test programs for
other parts of the machine (cache, CPU, whatever)?
