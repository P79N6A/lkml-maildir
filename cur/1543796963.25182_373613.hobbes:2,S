nice. Just to underline your point, on x86, with gcc 4.0.2, i'm getting 
this with your patch:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  11077       0       0   11077    2b45 exit.o.orig
  10997       0       0   10997    2af5 exit.o
so 80 bytes shaved off. I think such patches also increase readability.
