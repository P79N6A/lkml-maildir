Here's a strange situation.  I've been running another app that uses a
lot of swap, and now I notice the RSS for xdos, as reported by
/proc/XX/status, has gone into the negative range.

I presume this is not good.
If there's some more investigating I should do, please let me know by
e-mail ASAP.  I can't keep this thing running indefinitely, and I don't
know if it'll be reproducible.
TIA
