What's unclean about bnel?
I think ret_from_fork would be better like this:
	.globl	ret_from_fork
ret_from_fork:
	bl	schedule_tail
	lwz	r0,TASK_PTRACE(r2)
	andi.	r0,r0,PT_TRACESYS
	beq+	ret_from_except
	bl	syscall_trace
	b	ret_from_except
Unless of course you have bloated the kernel beyond 32MB, but then we
would be in all sorts of difficulties.

Can't you do this in arch/ppc/vmlinux.lds using PROVIDE() instead of
making the same change to each of the head*.S files?
Paul.
