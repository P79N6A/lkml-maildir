Hi,
I've compiled the 2.6.20.2 kernel today (I took the SuSE HEAD kernel instead 
of the vanilla one) and I'm having issues with the "imm" module. I still use 
a ZIP drive here for small backups and the "imm" module worked flawless on 
kernel 2.6.18.8 but with kernel 2.6.20.2 I get error messages that the device 
is offline even if the device is switched on and has a ZIP disk inside of it.
This is what I get from "dmesg" (Sorry for posting this here if it's the wrong 
place, but I wasn't sure if I should report this to Novell's bugzilla because 
I'm using the SuSE head kernel which is not officially supported)
