That's a strong possibility, good catch John.
Although, I'm still not ruling out some box in the middle
even though I consider it less likely than your theory.
So you're suggesting that tcp_prune_queue() should do the:
	if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) >= sk->sk_rcvbuf)
		tcp_clamp_window(sk, tp);
check after attempting to collapse the queue.
But, that window clamping should fix the problem, as we recalculate
the window to advertise.
