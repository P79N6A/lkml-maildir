Did you also read Greg's follow up posting:
     
http://www.kroah.com/log/2005/11/07#osdl_gkai2
where he says that he was wrong about OSDL pushing for binary drivers? 
(Not that the update was a glowing review of OSDL in general ;-))
I agree with Gerrit - from where I sit on OSDL's DCL tech forum, I have 
not seen any push for binary drivers and have seen consistent pressure 
pushing towards GPL'ed only drivers.
That position is strongly spelled out in the OSDL sponsored open drivers 
page as well.
