"should be" does not imply "won't"   :-)
On a drive which is capable of remapping sectors, imagine what
happens if the remapping data itself is corrupted. (the user data
is perfectly fine and is not being relocated)
What I mean is that the logical sector numbers not only change,
but they are the only thing changing. The user data never moves
to a different physical location, and is never intended to move.
The user data is perfectly readable. It just appears in the wrong
place as viewed by the OS.
