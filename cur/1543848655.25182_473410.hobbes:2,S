It would be nice if we could clean up some of the complicated locking in 
this code.  For example, from do_tty_hangup,
 *
 *      Locking:
 *              BKL
 *              redirect lock for undoing redirection
 *              file list lock for manipulating list of ttys
 *              tty_ldisc_lock from called functions
 *              termios_sem resetting termios data
 *              tasklist_lock to walk task list for hangup event
