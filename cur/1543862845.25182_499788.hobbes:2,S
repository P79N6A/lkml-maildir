Dunno if its magical, but it does solve a few issues I ran into.

This would be per NFS mount, pretty global indeed. But not different
that other backing_dev_info's. request_queue::nr_requests suffers a
similar fate.

Its a per backing_dev_info thing. So using the zone counters will not
work.

Yeah, that function used to be larger.

Hmm, right, thats not good indeed, I can pull the call to
nfs_commit_list() out of that loop.
