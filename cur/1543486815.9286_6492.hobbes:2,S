I know that compression ratio is important, but at least for me 
(still using a slow PODP83, and maybe may others too) CPU usage is
at least as important.  did you ever check `lzo' compression
from Markus Oberhumer <markus.oberhumer@jk.uni-linz.ac.at>
which is much faster than gzip (I'm using it for compressed backups
to keep the tape streaming rather than dripping;) which offers
in-memory compression library.  for more information have a look at
