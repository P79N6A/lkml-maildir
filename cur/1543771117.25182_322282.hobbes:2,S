Go read the thread on lkml a few weeks ago about how sync + vfat (and
others) does nasty destructive things to flash media that doesn't have
excelent wear leveling (vfat updates the fat sector for every block of
data written when you use sync option, which means you do a lot of
writes to one sector of the device, which is not good for devices with a
limited number of writes).  Typically when flash starts to reach it's
limit in number of writes, it starts having trouble holding the value
written (some bits start to drift back to one state) which can explain
your crc errors and such).
In other words: Don't use sync with flash media.  It's a horribly bad
idea, and if you look into how flash works (at least the cheaper ones)
you will realize why.  Anything with a limited number of writes allowed
to each sector should avoid rewriting the same sector again and again,
and that is what sync does when you use filesystems designed for disks
rather than flash.  JFFS was designed for flash use and rotates the
sectors it uses to store filesystem meta data and has spare space in the
filesystem to do wearleveling at the filesystem level.  vfat and ext2/3
do not, and it shows.  At least write caching/delayed write back
elliminates the worst of the rewriting of the meta data sectors.
