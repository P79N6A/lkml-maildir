This is what /proc/sys/vm/swappiness does in 2.5, actually.  It defines
the kernel's preference for pagecache over mapped memory.
Setting it to 100 (percent) makes it treat both types of memory equally.
Setting it to zero makes the kernel very much prefer to reclaim plain
pagecache rather than mapped-into-pagetables memory.
