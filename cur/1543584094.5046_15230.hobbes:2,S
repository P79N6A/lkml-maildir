No.
First of all HW_CACHEALIGN aligns to the L1 cache, not SMP_CACHE_BYTES.
Additionally you sometimes need a guaranteed alignment for other
problems, afaik ARM needs 1024 bytes for some structures due to cpu
restrictions, and several usb controllers need 16 byte alignment.
And some callers of kmem_cache_create() want SMP_CACHE_BYTES alignment,
other callers (and DaveM) expect L1_CACHE_BYTES alignment.
It's more a API clarification than a real change.
I think it can wait until 2.5:
drivers should use pci_alloc_consistent_pool(), not
kmalloc_aligned()+virt_to_bus(), arm can wait and the ability to choose
between SMP and L1 alignment is not that important.
