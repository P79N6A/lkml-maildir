I re-ran the tests again last night and founfd that I had made one 
mistake in my description.
The really poor results occured with the *ext3* filesystem, not ext2.
"mount" was telling me that the contents of /etc/fstab which was ext2 - 
but the kernel actually had it mounted it as ext3.
I think I might be able to give a little insight to the "0.34MB/s" and 
"0.48MB/s" numbers. I think these numbers closely match the theoretical 
performance rate when a single 4kB write occurs per disk rotation.
4kB * 5400RPM / 60 seconds = 360 kB/s
4kB * 7200RPM / 60 seconds = 480 kB/s
Perhaps the drives that I am running the test on do not have 
write-caching enabled.
By the time the first 4kB write has completed the drive may need to wait 
a complete rotation before it can do the next write. I don't think it 
quite explains the difference between ext2 and ext3. Any ideas?
Below are the resuls of ext2/ext3 tests on a new Seagate 80Gb SATA, 8MB 
Cache, model ST380023AS.
The ext3 results are a lot better, perhaps this drive has write caching 
enabled.
