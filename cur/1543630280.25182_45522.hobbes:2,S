	<shrug> relying on 5% in security-sensitive setup is *dumb*.
In that case you need properly set quota (better yet, no lusers with write
access anywhere on that fs)..
	There are worse holes problems 5% rule.  E.g. you can create a
file with hole, mmap over that hole, dirty the pages and exit.  Guess
who ends up writing them out?  Right, kswapd.  Which is run as root.
No suid applications required...
