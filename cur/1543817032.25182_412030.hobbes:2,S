Agreed.  It should.
But if I leave in CONFIG_IDE=y, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y I get root on
0x0302 rather than 0x0802 even when I also have CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
and CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX=y.
If the first two are not set then the kernel cannot find anything.
My understanding is that with Alan's patch everything should be
using major 8, and that CONFIG_IDE is no longer required, yes?
