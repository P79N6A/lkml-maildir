I can confirm that this is still an issue on 2.6.0-test5-bk5... I
didn't test -bk3 explicitly (although I certainly will if you like), as
I assume that any relevant changes will be in -bk5 as well.  The oops
appears to be essentially identical, so I'm omitting it and the debug
output in order to conserve bandwidth.  If you want to see it anyway,
just let me know.
Thanx!
