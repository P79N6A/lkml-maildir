Hi,
Don't know if this is the correct place to bring this up but 
/pub/linux/kernel/* seems to be unavailable on kernel.org via FTP. Both 
my linux box and my work Windows box can connect to kernel.org, but 
cding to the directory (I'm on the Windoze machine at the moment) gives:
230 Login successful.
ftp> cd pub
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> cd linux
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> cd kernel
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> cd v2.6
(after about 30 seconds)
Connection closed by remote host.
www.kernel.org via http seems to be REALLY slow as well.
Cheers
--Chris
