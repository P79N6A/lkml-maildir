Probably a stupid question, but I spent some time searching the net
for an answer without success:
What is the correct setting of the "Processor family" configuration
option for a 32 bit kernel which is going to run on an Intel
Pentium D 940 processor (cpu family 15, model 6)? It doesn't seem
to fit any of the available selections.
More generally, what is the correct way of selecting the processor
family option for a CPU whose name doesn't appear anywhere in the
prompts or help texts in arch/i386/Kconfig.cpu? I guess there must
be a way of deducing it from the content of /proc/cpuinfo, only I
cannot figure out how.
Thanks,
Tilman
