    I've tried linux-abi myself.  No luck at all.  Best I can tell it has
yet to reach the level of compatibility that iBCS has.  Although last
version I tried was the 2.4.3 patch on the linux abi web site.  I noticed a
newer one on the openlinux ftp site, might give that one a try too though
considering what happened with the one I previously tried I am nowhere near
optimistic.  Unfortunately this has burned me since I need to setup a new
system that uses the new features of the 2.4.x kernels (latest rieserfs,
better smp, support for the latest ide chipsets, better scaling) which also
can run SCO binaries.  I am actually at the point where I am strongly
considering trying to port iBCS myself though not sure about it yet mainly
due to concerns that I may not implement it correctly to work with some of
the latest kernel changes without understanding how the original iBCS was
designed.
    By the way is there a reason there isn't a patch to support the latest
available for the 2.2.x kernels?  Is it incompatible with the 2.2.x kernels?
I recently needed to downgrade the kernel on a machine due to 2.4.x
instability but was unable to due to the lack of a patch to support the
latest rieserfs on 2.2.x.
