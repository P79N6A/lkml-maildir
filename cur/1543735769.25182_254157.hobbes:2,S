I'm looking for recommendations on how to deal with the possibility of 
filesystem corruption.
As in the subject, I'm on 2.4.22, with SATA drives.
 From what I've read, the safest thing to do is to turn off the write cache and 
use a journalled filesystem.  However the hardware guy says that turning off the 
write cache also turns off the automatic error correction on writes, so the 
write may return an error rather than being remapped silently.
What's the best way for me to deal with this?
Chris
