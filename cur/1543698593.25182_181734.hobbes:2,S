Oddly that's what I have been doing, but we've run out of time to
completely eliminate the recursions in PCMCIA before the 2.6 brakes
were turned on.  Sure, if someone wants to try submitting a PCMCIA
rewrite to Linus right now and wants to receive Linus' flames, go
ahead. 8)
So, for the time being, live with the fact that current automated
program analysis detects the recusion.  Inteligent human examination
will tell you that it can't infinitely recurse.
