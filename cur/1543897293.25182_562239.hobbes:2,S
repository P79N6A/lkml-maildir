For the K7 and K8 cores AMD systems are exactly like Intel systems
with respect to MTRRs (although AMD systems also have additional registers)
For the K9 core (i.e. AMD socket F or the K8 with DDR2 support) there
is an additional mechanism that makes everything above 4G write-back
cacheable without using any MTRRs.
So only on the very latest AMD cpus would this code not be applicable.
