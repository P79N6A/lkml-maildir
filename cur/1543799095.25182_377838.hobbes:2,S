You reminded me that I failed to put in the summary that whitelist/blacklist ARE in this patch as
well as the sysfs. Apply the patch, and set your white or black list with the vendor_id:device_id
that you desire. This needs to be done after bootup.
We plan on some userspace script for initializing EDAC, etc. But we need it in the kernel first. 
We will put such at bluesmoke.sourceforge.net
