Subject: 2.4.2-ac[78] boot hang on k6-2 due to UP_APIC

A couple of days ago, I reported that 2.4.2-ac7 was hanging on boot on
my k6-2 machine. I compiled ac-8, but turned odd UP_APIC, and it
worked (I vaguely remember some APIC-related hangs reported in the
past). If this is a new problem, I can narrow it down with a few
recompiles.
