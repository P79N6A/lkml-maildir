Your module initialization gets the current maximum number of tasks,
allocates an array of the desired size and stores the size and address
of the array in the module.  Then store whatever you want in your
private data area.  If the max tasks value changes on the fly,
reallocate your private data.  Use a read/write to protect your private
data during resizing.
