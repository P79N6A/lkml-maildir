Hello everybody,
I would like some info about proxy arp behaviour.
I have a firewall linux running kernel 2.4.25
with 3 NIC. Proxy arp is enabled on two of them
(eth0 and eth1).
eth1 configuration is here:
ifconfig eth1 10.77.77.1 broadcast 10.77.77.3 netmask 255.255.255.252
ip route del 10.77.77.0/30 dev eth1
ip route add 172.17.1.0/24 dev eth1
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/proxy_arp
Hosts connected to eth1 are all 172.17.1.0/24.
The linux box is now replying to arp requests
that are sent by 172.17.1.0/24 hosts on the eth1
network segment. Is this because ip on eth1 is
10.77.77.1?
I think that linux should not reply to arp request
for 172.17.1.0/24 because of:
ip route add 172.17.1.0/24 dev eth1
Is this a bug?
TIA
