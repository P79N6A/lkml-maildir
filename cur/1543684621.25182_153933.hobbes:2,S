The db corruption hit again on test2-mm2. I am on -test1-mm1 trying to
reproduce it there. I don't now what little query or update is the
problem. There is nothing in the system logs. I went through everything
that I thought might have been happening at the time and the tables came
up clean with the "check tables" command. Then it happened a bit later.
There is a cron job doing a query every minute, but it doesn't happen
all the time. I don't know, its probably some config change I made to
mysql.
I am still backing out the 64 bit devt bit, I assume that is still
needed. The db and mysql binaries are on, respectively:
/dev/vg02/varlv /var ext3 rw,noatime,nosuid,nodev 0 0
/dev/vg02/usrlv /usr ext3 rw,noatime,nodev 0 0
mysql version
mysql  Ver 12.12 Distrib 4.0.3-beta, for pc-linux-gnu (i686)
