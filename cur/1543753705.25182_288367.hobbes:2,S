Doubtless.  So far I only have 1 e1000 driver issue.  The IBM guys
were tracking an issue with one of the aic7xxx cards.  But those kinds
of issues seem to be fairly rare right now :)

To some extent.  It is worth noting that the first 13 of my patches
are not core functionality they are bug fixes or feature enhancements
of code that simply have come to be associated with the work on kexec.
Which is why I put them first in the list of things so it is clear
they don't depend on the core kexec code.  So some work in that
area seems to be happening and from what I have heard about ppc64
kexec support has been a motivating reason to clean up their boot
process some more.
The nice thing at this point I think one more cycle through the
development process and we should have a fairly well defined and
working mechanism for taking crash dumps.  With the remaining work
left simply to porting it.
