Perhaps for the sake of portability the best way to approach it would
be:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
#!perl

On linux systems with this support, /usr/local/bin/perl5 would be
checked first, if it isn't there then it looks for relative
interpreters for `perl'. This would make your hack more backward
compatible.
