No, the idea is to physically separate the headers.
include/{linux,asm} is currently copied to userspace, hacked a bit,
and then shipped as the "glibc-kernheaders" package.
I would rather that the kernel developers directly maintained this
interface, by updating headers in include/abi, rather than ad-hoc by
distro people.
