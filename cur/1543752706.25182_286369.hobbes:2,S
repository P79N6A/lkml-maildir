Hi!

Good news is it booted. But I could not measure any powersavings by
turning it on. (I could measure difference between HZ=100 and
HZ=1000).
Hmm, it does not want to do anything. threshold used to be 1000, does
it mean that it would not use vst unless there was one second of quiet
state? I tried to lower it to 10 ("get me HZ=100 power consumption")
but it does not seem to be used, anyway:
root@amd:/proc/sys/kernel/vst# cat successful_vst_exit
0
root@amd:/proc/sys/kernel/vst# cat external_intr_exit
0

Ugh, if minimum recomended value is 10K, why does it have 1K as a
default?

It definitely booted with vst disabled here... echo 1 did the trick
through.

...it is bad idea to have them world-readable, then.
