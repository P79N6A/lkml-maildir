Sorry, some of us (me) don't know that much about Nowell. What
advantages does it have over ext2? Is it faster? Does it have fast
fsck? Is it tolerant to power-of?
Or is it there just to be compatible with nowell? [Just as vfat is
there only to be compatible with windows, because it is slower than
ext2 and much more ugly.]
