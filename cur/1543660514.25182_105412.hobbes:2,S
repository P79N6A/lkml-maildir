OK, rev#4 (and hopefully final).  I only renamed a file,
as per suggestion of Andrew Morton.  Haven't seen anything
else worth changing.
Quick recap of the mods involved:
  o Documentation/x86-hal.txt      # added file
  o include/asm-i386/eflags_if.h   # added file (only used for VM)
  o arch/i386/Kconfig              # added one menu entry
  o arch/i386/Makefile             # added one ifdef..endif
  o arch/i386/boot/Makefile        # added one ifdef..endif
Diffs are available at:

The file 'Documentation/x86-hal.txt' explains the rationale for
these mods and my case for them going into the kernel before 2.6.
No *.{c,h,S} files are modified.
