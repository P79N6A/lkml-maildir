1) If someone has already reserved that address,  it (the page) will not join to
   buddy allocator and it's no problem.
2) No, I can grow the zone.
   A reserved page is the last page of "not aligned contiguous mem_map", not zone.
I answer your question ?
I know this patch contains some BUG, if a page is allocateed when calculate_alinged_end()
is called, and is freed after calling this, it is never reserved and join to buddy system.

I'll rewrite this.
/*
 *  calculate_aligned_end() has to be called by each contiguous mem_map.
