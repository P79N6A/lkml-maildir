So then you will have to reboot sometimes. BTW, IDE can be hot swapped if you 
are carefull:
Umount the device,
unplug it.
Plug in the same device (same model)
Remount.
A bit risky to your hardware, but I have used this way for harddisks several 
time when a system has to keep running. Never used it for compact flash 
though.
Another option: Buy an USB card controller or a pcmcia controller for in your 
pc. Costs about $10,-
