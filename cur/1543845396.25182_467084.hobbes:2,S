Did you check that WOL was enabled? I need to re-activate it after each
boot (I guess that's normal, not sure though).
The output of "ethtool eth0" should show:
        Supports Wake-on: g
        Wake-on: g
Also, I remember a bugzilla entry in which it was said that the MAC was
somehow reversed by the driver. I that is still the case (I can't find
the bugzilla entry right now), you might just reverse the MAC address in
your WOL packet to workaround the bug.
