Indeed.

In my source tree pulled about at the end of last night here (10pm in 
California) it is still GDT_ENTRIES*8-1. Time to pull :-)
	Gabriel.
P.S: since the first entry is not used, the first 8 bytes could be filled
with
	1:	.word 0
gdt_table_desc: .word GDT_ENTRIES*8-1
		.long 1b
to eliminate the array of GDT descriptors and save a few bytes.
