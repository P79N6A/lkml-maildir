OK, but first can You try to fix Your cron daemon? Just make sure that if mpop 
is already started it won't be started again. Maybe something like "pgrep mpop" 
and "if [ $?". 
I don't remember exactly, but some time ago somebody had problem with to large 
disk buffers and sync(). Check LKML archives. MPOP is doing fsync().
You have VIA chipset. Me too. It isn't very reliable. Don't You have something 
like "error { d0 BUSY }" in dmesg? This would explain high CPU load. Simply 
DMA isn't used after such error and disk goes to PIO mode. On two disk system 
load is about 4.0 in this case. Simple program takes hours to complete if 
there is havy I/O in progress. Btw. SLUB seems to behave better in this 
situation (at least up to 8.0).
