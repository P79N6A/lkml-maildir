Confused over terminology?
Tie PVs together to form a VG, then divide VG up into LVs.
Size limit depends on metadata format and the kernel: old LVM1 format has 
lower size limits - see the vgcreate man page.
New LVM2 metadata format relaxes those limits and lets you have LVs > 2TB
with a 2.6 kernel.
