I am looking at 2.6.16-rc1 and I don't see cpu_possible_map
being set in setup_smp(). That said, it seems alpha setup_smp()
probes for cpus there, so there is no reason why it cannot
be set there. I think it is wrong not to set cpu_possible_map
very early.
Or perhaps it got fixed later on, in which case, oh well, I need
to download more often. <sigh>.
