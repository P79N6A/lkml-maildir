Sweet.  Hope you like it.  I think its very valuable during all sorts of
kernel debugging (or even simple administrating), because everything is
tied into the slab layer but /proc/slabinfo, while useful information,
is impossible to grok.
This is actually inspired (although not really based on) Martin Bligh's
vmtop perl script.  I just checked in a little "thanks" to him into the
man page ;-)
