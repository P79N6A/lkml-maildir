Logically I think we can only expect 'real' filesystems with block
devices or similiar behind them to do something with fsync and
everyone else to be more or less undefined.
Undefined creates problems I guess so I guess simple_dir_operations
could return 0 (it sorta does make sense, if you have no backing store
you are always in-sync?).
