khubd and ksuspend_usbd.

Those two threads will try to resume USB devices in response to wakeup
requests.  Such requests arrive during a suspend or resume transition
more often than one would expect.
If the resume attempt occurs before the host controller has been 
suspended, it will abort the system suspend.  If it occurs after the 
host controller is suspended (and before the controller resumes) it 
will fail and try to unregister the USB device -- something else we 
don't like happening while the sytem is only partially up (not to 
mention the annoyance caused by the unregistration of a perfectly 
functional device).
