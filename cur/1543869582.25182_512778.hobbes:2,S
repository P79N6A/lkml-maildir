I'm guessing my patch to switch the appropriate from get_irq_data to
get_irq_msi was merged in between that conversation and this.
Sorry about that. 
There was a real problem that ppc used the data stored in get_irq_data
for something else.  So we added a dedicated pointer to struct irq_desc.
If that isn't the issue holler and I will look into it a little more.
