Matt, some 3d drivers are known to do sched_yield() behind user's back,
(notably dri radeon ones, grep for sched_yield:
http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/mesa/Mesa/src/mesa/drivers/dri/r200/r200_ioctl.c?revision=1.37&view=markup
http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/mesa/Mesa/src/mesa/drivers/dri/r300/radeon_ioctl.c?revision=1.14&view=markup
)
thus absolutely killing any desktop interactivity whatsoever.
If you see sched_yield() when stracing any 3d program, I suggest you
to try this bruteforce workaround, which works fine for me,
disable sched_yield():
