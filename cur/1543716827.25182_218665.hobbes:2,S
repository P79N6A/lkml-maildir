gcc-3.4 generates warnings about it:
include/asm/rwsem.h: In function `avc_audit':
include/asm/rwsem.h:126: warning: read-write constraint does not allow a register
include/asm/rwsem.h:126: warning: read-write constraint does not allow a register
The gcc people (or at least one of them) seem to think that these warnings are
correct on a "+m" constraint. See:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107475162200773&w=2
I understood "+m" to be a shorthand way of specifying "=m" and "m" on the same
bit of memory, but apparently it that's not what it means.
