Currently, both machines are working and stable.  I may have tanted the
results by bleeding on them, however.

First, both machines have un-certified "POWMEM" memory modules.  So, that's
my first suspect.  Tyan boards act insane with "bad" memory.  That said,
memtest86 cannot stress memory in the way it needs to be stressed to
actually fail.  The ring buffers from the e1000's (64bit, 133MHz PCI-X)
will stress memory in the extreme.
If you have "spread spectrum" enabled (search all the BIOS screens), turn
it off and see if the machine becomes more stable.  Failing that, find
known good memory (certified for use in the MB by the manufacturer.)  From
there, try reducing the PCI bus speed (if possible -- there's a bios
option on the i7501)
I'm still running with "pci=noacpi" so that might be adding to the soluion.
I wasn't seeing any IDE problems.  In fact, the disk isn't being touched
at all.
