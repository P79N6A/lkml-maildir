Well maybe he should just go away then and save his and our time. 
Reiser4 works just fine without Christoph.  Users are happy with it. 
None of them have asked for his help.  I don't consider Christoph to be
qualified to work on our filesystem.  I would not hire him if he applied
--- he is not capable of innovative work.
Reiser4 is far from perfect, but it is ready for more users.

Yes, but the helpful ones have nothing to do with VFS.  Linux has lost
filesystem developers because of the VFS team, developers who I can tell
you were very very  gifted DARPA researchers who decided to work on BSD
because they had too much dignity to develop a filesystem for  Linux.  I
assure you that no one on the VFS team is as bright or capable as one of
the fellows I know of that they abused away.

Yes, which is why people who have not written a serious filesystem
should not instruct those who have written the measurably fastest one.

Christoph is not testing.  We have tested, our mailing list has tested.....

We are supposed to write a filesystem so that overheating CPUs do not
make it crash?
Prejudice is a very simple phenomenom.  When either ext3 or ReiserFS V3
crash it is almost always due to bad hardware.  Prejudice is the process
of remembering that one filesystem crashed due to bad hardware and not
remembering that the other one crashed.
It is remarkably simple how it works: people who use Reiser4 want it in,
people who use ext3 and don't want to have a choice of something else
don't want it in.  That was true of V3, and it is true of V4.  My point
of course is that those who have used V4 know more about it than those
who haven't......
I think Alan Cox is the only poster who has no intention of using
Reiser4 but said at one point that he thinks it should go in.
V3 is obsoleted by V4 in every way.  V3 is old code that should be
marked as deprecated as soon as V4 has passed mass testing.   V4 is far
superior in its coding style also.  Having V3 in and V4 out is at this
point just stupid. 
This whole thing reminds me of an IBMer who told me that he thought that
IBM lost to MS because they called OS/2 by a name other than DOS.  The
sad thing is he was probably right. 
V4, as it is today, is as much superior to V3 as OS/2 was to DOS.  Any
distro or user who would stay with V3 for new installs once we have
passed mass testing is nuts.  We need the mass testing.
