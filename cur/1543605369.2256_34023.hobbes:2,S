That's very interesting.  It would explain why it takes 2 seconds _every_
time you invoke "mdir", whereas before the invocations after the first one
were more or less instantenous.  And indeed, as you say, mounting a floppy
does result in a good performance.
However, it does not explain why the first invocation is two times slower
(it's 1 sec with kernel 2.4.9 and 2 secs with 2.4.10, the effect is even
more visible for mcopy of a small file, like 30KB).  I strace'd mdir and
it's opening /dev/fd0 just once, at the beginning, and closing it at the
end.
