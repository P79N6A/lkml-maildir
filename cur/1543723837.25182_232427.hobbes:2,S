The original "plan" for error logging was to eventually take out the
printk's all together once we could get ela (the userspace daemon
responsible for parsing error messages and routing them appropriately)
into all distros. We didn't want the possibility of a customer losing a
vital message by not having ela installed.  
I would propose the making the printk's of the messages a kernel config
option.  Then the distros could turn it on or off depending on if they
are packaging ela.  All messages should still go to userspace though.
This will alleviate the spamming of the printk buffer.
I have no problems in moving communication between kernel and userspace
to netlink.  Whomever makes the change needs to keep Mike Strosaker and
Nathan Fontenot informed since they are maintaining the user space
counterpart. 
Thanks,
Jake
