I think it's entirely due to the awesome effort by Chuck Ebbert of Red
Hat.  He has been digging through all of the applied patches to Linus's
tree and been forwarding them on to the stable team.  Without his effort
and help, we would not have so many patches in these releases.
I know I personally owe him at least one beer if I run into him at some
conference, and I think all other users of the stable tree do too.
thanks,
