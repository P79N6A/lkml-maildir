Here's one that I'd like (came up recently with these 21600x21600x3
images from NASA:-): MADV_REVERSE_SEQUENTIAL. When converting images
from stupid formats which have the origin in the top-left, to formats
which have the origin in the bottom-left (the way god intended), you
can avoid a massive malloc(3) if you read the input file backwards
(basically through llseek(2) steps).
