Bingo.  git-describe is what I was looking for.  It's more accurate to use
as a reference even after rcN come out.  My current cloned tree of yours
sez:
	v2.6.23-6562-g8add244
One more small git question: I keep a separate tree for unionfs, which I
rebase often based on your tree.  But my tree sez:
$ git-describe
v2.6.21-rc1-22880-g3a1848d
"v2.6.21-rc1"?  What am I missing (some tags I forgot to pull?)  Why isn't
git-describe saying that I'm based on your latest tree?
Thanks,
Erez.
