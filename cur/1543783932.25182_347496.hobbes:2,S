The whole point of the orcacle cluster filesystem as it was described in old
papers was about pfiles, control files and software, because you can easyly
use direct block access (with ASM) for tablespaces.

Yes, I dont dispute the usefullness of OCFS for ORA_HOME (beside I think a
replicated filesystem makes more sense), I am just nor sure if anybody sane
would use it for tablespaces.
I guess I have to correct the artile in my german it blog :) (if somebody
can name productive customers).
Gruss
