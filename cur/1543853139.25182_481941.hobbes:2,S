hm, that should be solved by the generic edge-triggered flow handler as
well: we never mask an IRQ first time around, we only mask it if
we /already/ have the 'soft' IRQ_PENDING flag set. (in that case the
lost edge is not an issue because we have the information already - and
the masking will prevent a screaming edge source)
but maybe this concept has not been pushed through to the disable/enable
irq logic itself? (it's only present in the flow handler) Thomas, do you
concur?
