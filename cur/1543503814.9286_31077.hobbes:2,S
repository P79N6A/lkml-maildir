Well, actually my answer wasn't really focused on flanging... Because of
the delay issue, I agree that flanging is a bad example. (Not MY idea!
;-)
What about simulating an RC filter? can be done one sample at a time,
using a single variable (C) per channel... In that case, the
input->output delay depends only on the hardware and the scheduling.
THAT's low latency processing! :-) (If it's practically useful is
another matter...)

That's the kind of processing I'm interested in. And the delay should be
as low as possible (within reasonable limits), and still, there must
never be a single drop-out.

Why not? For example, I can setup a periodic task at, say 8 kHz,
watching the DMA buffers or whatever. The big advantage over user space
is that the task will preempt EVERYTHING, including all Linux
interrupts. There will be no drop-outs.

Agree. And again, that RTL task will just take as much CPU time as it
needs. (Be careful; control brings responsibility... A watchdog task is
strongly recommended!)
