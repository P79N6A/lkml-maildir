There is smc_open() as well, but only smc_timeout() is really 
problematic because of the schedule_work() call.

Please make it another flag.  You could replace your dev_hold(dev) with 
lp->work_pending = 1 and dev_put() with lp->work_pending = 0, then 
adding a while (lp->work_pending) schedule() in place of the 
flush_scheduled_work().
And while you're at it, could you replace:
smc_phy_configure(void *data)
with
smc_phy_configure(struct net_device *dev)
The parameter doesn't have to be void *data anymore now that you 
introduced smc_phy_configure_wq().
And finally, please tell about the reason why flush_scheduled_work() 
can't be used in your comment.
