Hi,
My Supermicro X5DPL-iGM-O has a winbond w83627hf chip onboard that 
includes a watchdog timer.  I found a driver on freshmeat that points 
here: 
http://www.freestone.net/soft/pkg/w83627hf-wdt.tar.gz
but this does not seem to work correctly on 2.4.23, even with my 
modifications to the ioports and registers that Supermicro sent me. I 
have tried to contact the developer, he hasn't responded.  I also 
located a post to linux-kerel quite sometime ago:
http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2002/Dec/att-4150/w83627hf_wdt.c
  I haven't tried this driver just yet. The lm_sensors project seems to 
include a driver for this chip as well, but not for the watchdog part. 
The specifications Supermicro sent me for the watchdog function are 
located here:

Any help would greatly be appreciated, I know this particular chip is 
included with many motherboards.
Ethan
