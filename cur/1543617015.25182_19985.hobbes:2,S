Indeed.  In the beginning I was also afraid I'd hit the fork()
problem Eric mentions, but after running lots of tests I can't
really say it has shown up in the profiles anywhere.
I'm sure you could make a benchmark to clearly show it, but for
most common workloads it doesn't seem to be much of an issue.
A possible exception to this is apache, I need to look into that
a bit more.

Rik
