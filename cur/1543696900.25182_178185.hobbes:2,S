we've more solutions now. The file contents to "updating" would work too
but I believe it would be by far the most complicated, the md5sum has
the advantage of valiating the file contents too and it only requires 1
file update to be atomic, no matter how the upload of the data paylod
happens, so I tend to like it most even if it only works
probabilitsically (but it's sure safe enough).
However I understand Larry has no real interest in helping us to
rsync a known to be coherent copy of the repository (very understandable
from his own business standpoint), so I guess this is all wasted time,
and we've to live with an heuristic like:
       1:rsync
	sleep 60
	rsync -> if something changed goto 1
I doubt Peter can provide the coherency guarantee with the md5sum on his
side, unless it's Peter fetching the update of the scm data, and not the
other way around.
