Interesting that coverity found that, but failed to find the other
leaks in that function from exactly the same code and error
case.....

Not the right fix - we should only be trying to free valid
buftargs, which means xfs_unmountfs_close() is the correct
place to fix this....
e.g:
-	if (mp->m_logdev_targp != mp->m_ddev_targp)
+	if (mp->m_logdev_targp && (mp->m_logdev_targp != mp->m_ddev_targp))
As to the afore-mentioned leaks, if we fail to allocate a realtime
buftarg, then we will leak a reference to both the rtdev and logdev,
and if we fail to allocate an external log buftarg we'll leak a
reference to the logdev. i.e., we fail to do one or both of:
	xfs_blkdev_put(logdev);
	xfs_blkdev_put(rtdev);
To remove the bdev references we may have gained earlier. Normally,
these references are released by xfs_free_buftarg(), but because we
failed to allocate the buftarg, we can't drop the references via
that method....
Cheers,
Dave.
