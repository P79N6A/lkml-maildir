It would seem that swsusp doesn't properly suspend devices, or more
precisely it wakes them up again before suspending the machine.
The problem is in swsusp_suspend(). It is designed as if
swsusp_arch_suspend() would suspend the hardware, when in fact all it
does is prepare for a suspend. The effect is that devices are brought
back up because swsusp_suspend() believes it is resuming.
Below is a patch that uses the same system as kernel/power/disk.c to
determine if it's suspending or resuming. The patch brings up a new
problem though, disk writes generate a huge amount of "scheduling while
atomic".
