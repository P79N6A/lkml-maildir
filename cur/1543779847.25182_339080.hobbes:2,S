Hello,
I found X-OUTRCPT-TO: header since
Linux-kernel-daily-digest Digest, Vol 8, Issue 21
(at Date: Thu, 21 Jul 2005 06:00:01 -0500).
The X-OUTRCPT-TO: header exposes recipient's mail addresses.
And recently I'm getting spam mails to the exposed address.
I want you to hide X-OUTRCPT-TO header if you can.
I sent to the person managing the list
(linux-kernel-daily-digest-owner@lists.us.dell.com)
on Mon, 1 Aug 2005 20:11:31 +0900, but no reply.
So I sent to you this time.
Regards...
