I think that your should post this patch to people working on the bonding
project, since there are other pending patches. I used to be one of them, but
really don't have time anymore. Please take a look at :

Anyway, I agree that your patch is useful for several situations, mainly cases
of dual attachment to a lan with 2 routers (master/slave), and I too would like
to get it in a future kernel. But it's a new feature and we're in -rc now, so
may be we'll have to wait for 2.4.21pre.
Cheers,
Willy
