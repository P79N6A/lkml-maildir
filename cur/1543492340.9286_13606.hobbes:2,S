hi!
	for a personal project, I would like to contribute to linux ACLs on
ext2(if the project is still active today!) Please let me know:
1) Whom should I contact in this regard?
2) If no one is working on ACLs anymore, then where can I find the
current status and how can I pick up from there?
With Warm Regards
Tarun
