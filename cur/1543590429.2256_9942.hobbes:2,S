In most cases, good luck.  Though as you pointed out, checking RIPE might
help.
I mentioned in here (kernel list) about dogpile.com not supporting
it.  I've tried to contact their administrators with no luck.

Agreed.  For now ECN has been disabled here.  I got tired of so many sites
not supporting it that I gave up.  Maybe by 2.8.x kernels it will be worth
turning back on.  Thats not to say however that I don't like what the ECN
people are trying to do, rather its causing me more grief with it on, then
the grief I get with it off.
