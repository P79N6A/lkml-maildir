> Use PCI DMA 'lost interrupt' problem with some hw [which ?]
wow !
I do have 'Use PCI DMA' in my 2.2.15pre14
and I do get 'lost interrupt' when trying to restore data from
my ide-tape OnStream 30Go. of course it doesn't work.
I have to try disabling 'Use PCI DMA' though.
So your answer could include 'OnStream 30Go ide-tape'
