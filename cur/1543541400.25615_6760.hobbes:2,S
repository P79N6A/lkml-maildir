Also, you should try to avoid doing these kinds of operations inside a
spinlock, simply because they are slow (ATOMIC does not imply "fast", it
only implies that we won't schedule). 
Rule of thumb: use GFP_ATOMIC only inside interrupt handlers or bottom
half routines.  In any other case, try to just do the allocation before
you do the spinlock (or drop the lock and re-start). 
It's not positively _wrong_ to do a GFP_ATOMIC inside a spinlock, it's
just something to be avoided as much as possible.  Sometimes it is
unavoidable (or really ugly to avoid).  But everybody should be aware of
the fact that the less you do inside a spinlock, the less contention you
will have (and this is often a super-linear effect - read some queueing
theory if you really care about the exact issues).
