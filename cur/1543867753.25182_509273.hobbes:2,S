So that the compiler has to assume that if its accessing this __packed
structure, it may be embedded unaligned within something else? And
because the pointer is cast through (void *) it isn't allowed to use
alias analysis to notice that the pointer wasn't originally (apparently)
unaligned.
Seems sound to me.
