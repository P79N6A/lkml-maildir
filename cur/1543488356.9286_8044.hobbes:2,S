Well, I can only base on what I've heard. The approach you describe above
will certainly work, but I have read somewhere that putting the CPU into off
mode for a short moment through power management worked too, somehow.

Hmm, I think I'll have to dig the article out somewhere. I think the
BIOS way is 'fix #2' when they realized the first won't work.

Yeah, both the Awards and AMIs (which are the most common) have a
NVRAM layout description in the FlashROMs, all with bit fields and menu
item texts. Piece of cake to find the right bit in this case.
Have fun,
