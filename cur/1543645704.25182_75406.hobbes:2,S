	Estemeed kernel developers,
	I adress you this offtopic question, but I know that only here I  can 
find a corect and authoritative answer:
	Did some of you know a reliable and production ready implementation of 
iSCSI server ( host adapter) protocol because I was able to find only 
client software for Linux.
	Thank you for your help and patince,
		Mircea Ciocan
