If he did a [mc]alloc to ALLOCate the the memory and got a non-null
return, it certainly said it did.

If I used [mc]alloc(), I wasn't asking about free resources. I was
asking for ALLOCation of memory.

If a process can segfault trying to use memory it has succeeded in
allocating, then the system has made a ghastly error.

The explanation is not the issue. The issue is having programs that
act correctly (check malloc() returns, don't follow null pointers,
etc.) fail in ways that are quite difficult for their programmers
to prevent.
For example, this implies one should not run a production database on
a multi-user Linux machine since it could crash in non-recoverable
ways.
