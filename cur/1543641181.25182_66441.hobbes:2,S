Thanks!
Yes, I've noticed this in the 2.5.31 kernel. This is something
to be done on open by the overlying fs or userspace utility, or
should I set the flag on the inode->filp (or whatever) myself in
the drivers open function? And do I need to define
inode->mapping->a_ops->direct_IO()? (sorry - but I haven't had time to
experiment yet today!).
It looks like the 2.5 kernel has this pathway, but what about the 2.4
kernel? Nothing.
