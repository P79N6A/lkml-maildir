I have done a lot of testing with async i/o with the kernel that comes with
RH6.2 which is the same as you're referencing. On close a POLL_HUP and then a
POLL_IN get sent to the app.  I'm using sigtimedwait && sigwaitinfo rather than
poll.  If you're looking for sample implementations you can get phhttpd at
zabbo.net, or I just put up a sample implementation which is designed to be a
sigio library (just beginning few bugs hanging around) its on anon ftp at
isupportlive.com/pub/libfio.tar.gz .   The source is very small and it's pretty
easy to understand.  I can't help but think possibly your implementation is off
because I haven't experienced the problems your speaking of, are you removing
the O_ASYNC flag before the close event or something?
Anyhoo, for a lot of people generally interested in async io you may want to
check out the phhttpd list, instructions are on www.zabbo.net.  You might want
to repost to that list, Chuck, Zach, Stephen, Andi and myself are known to
answer there.  (Though my kernel's been Oopsing lately in the response category
<this is a joke, attempted one anyway>)
Later,
Shane.
(Phhttpd has handling code for both signal driven and poll, so it might be more
interesting to you.  The present version is designed for your kernel version as
well as that's the one Chuck Lever runs and he put out the last revision.)
