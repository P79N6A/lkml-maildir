per CPU ids are simple (just seed with a different secret). Is it worth

The secure RND can run with a few cache lines, the AVL inetpeer
code needs a potentially unlimited number of cache lines. Given
the current CPU/memory speed ratio, I think the OpenBSD approach
looks much better (my first vote for the per-dst counter was based
on the assumptions that it is free because the routing cache can be
used). Also I think the secure RND is needed anyways to generate 
the initial per destination ip counter (so unless you always talk 
to the same host the overhead is the same + some ugly code)
For what else would you want to use the inetpeer cache?
The assumption that it can hold information for all peers looks 
broken to me. Every attacker can pollute it enough to fill all 
available memory (so you only raise the limit over the routing cache
hash a bit, not fix it)
So I think the best solution is to use a reasonably secure RND
that works with minimal state. What do the crypto experts on l-k
recommend?
