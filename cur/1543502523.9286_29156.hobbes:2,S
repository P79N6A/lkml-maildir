Eh? If you use select or poll directly your code can get a bit messy. However, if
you build an event oriented library on top of select you can cook up simple elegant
servers very quickly. I've been doing it for years.
Threads mean lots of asynchronous behaviour. Asynchronous behaviour means major
testing problems. The asynchronous behaviour in select based servers is much more
limited, so their testability is much better. I can cook up simple servers based on
my event library in a few hours, and they run reliably. A threaded application
couldn't be tested well in that time.
Of course, a select based application won't scale to multiple CPUs, but for a
single CPU environment nothing beats it for simplicity, testability, or - as you
point out - performance.
