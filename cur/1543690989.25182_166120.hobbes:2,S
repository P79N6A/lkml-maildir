No doubt because that is what comes from your keyboard controller.
I do not think this is a Linux matter.
If you want to check, try 2.4 and see that the same happens.

These are key up sequences for keys that the kernel did not think were down.
0xb8: LAlt up
0x9d: LCtrl up
0xae: C up
0xa0: D up
0xc0: F6 up
0x9c: Enter up

Most KVMs emit some garbage at the moment of switching.

That is the opposite phenomenon: the kernel sees a key down but no key up.

I imagine that your problems, apart from the key repeat, are not Linux problems
but hardware problems.
