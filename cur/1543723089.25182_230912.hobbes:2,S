2.6 series kernels on HP Netserver LH4 - kernel panic on boot
First, sorry if this ends up being a double-post, but here goes:
In attempting to migrate to the 2.6 series Linux kernel on my HP 
Netserver LH4, I've run into a kernel panic on boot.  This happens 
nearly immediately upon booting to the kernel, and so quickly that I 
can't make out anything other than the truncated (transcribed) dump 
appended below.
2.4.x kernels work without a hitch on this system (I was trying to move 
from 2.4.26 to 2.6.6 or 2.6.7 -- both of which produce the same 
problem.).  I've also searched around a bit online, and found a couple 
other mentions of what seem to be the same problem, however, there were 
no replies to go along with them.
The dump below is from a vanilla 2.6.7 kernel:

   <0>Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!
Any help on this would be much appreciated, and I would be more than 
happy to provide any additional information which may be needed.
Thanks,
Andrew Feldhacker
