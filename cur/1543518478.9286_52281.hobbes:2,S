Subject: Process stuck in "D" state (uninterruptable sleep) which involve IO with /proc/isapnp

I've been trying to get my sound blaster working again with 2.3.30, and
I've been playing with /proc/isapnp.  
I did the following:
[root@smitten]:/proc# cat > /proc/isapnp <<EOF
> card 0 CTL002a
> dev 0 CTL0031
> auto
> EOF
And the process never goes back to the bash prompt.  I tried to "cat
/proc/isapnp", and that process got stuck in the "D" state also. 
ps reports:
  308 pts/1    D      0:00 cat
  328 pts/3    D      0:00 cat /proc/isapnp
With regards to the sound blaster issues, I recompiled the
kernel with the following change in drivers/sound/sound_config.h :
- #define DDB	{}
+ #define DDB	x
And I got the following on kernel bootup:
Sound initialization started
sb_dsp_detect(220,5,1) entered
sb: No response to RESET
Doing ESS1688 address selection
sb: No response to RESET
sb: No response to RESET
SB reset failed
Sound initialization complete
I've compiled sound support, and isapnp support into the kernel.
(monolithic)
If anyone has any patches, or the like, I'll be happy to test them.  I'm
not very good at this kernel debugging stuff.
