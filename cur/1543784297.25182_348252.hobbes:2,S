If we continue with Takahiro-san's design, then I agree that the name
'subcpusets' doesn't have quite the right connotations, and would join
you in exploring alternative names.
First it looks to be worth exploring alternatives that make resource
control more an attribute of existing cpusets than a new (sub) type of
cpuset, as Dinakar and I have both contemplated in earlier posts today.
