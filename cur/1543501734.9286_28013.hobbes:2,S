You can do this manually now, though not in a safe manner, by directly
changing the sys_call_table array of system calls. Also, in a proposed patch
by Alexander Maryanchick (dated around Jun 25), you can do this through what
appears to be a cleaner way.
(Obviously, you'll have to come up with some way of synchronizing between
different modules, or things wouldn't be too friendly).
I've done such things in the past (and am actually currently working on
something that messes with it too), with no problems. I've been running a
system that has used several 'new' system calls, as well as 'overwritten'
some existing system calls, as a production system for lengthly periods of
time with no observable trouble.
