Hi all,
just logged on this morning and saw the load of the machine (2.2.3 smp on
Dual-PPro) being pretty high. Some quick checks showed init went haywire
and almost all processes (knfsd, kswapd,...) were zombies. :-(
Beside this the system was still in a usable state, network was just fine,
kde came up nicely. finding no reason for this I tried to shutdown(8) the
machine, but switching runlevels did not work.
Nothing in the logs, after a hard reboot the system came up as it
should...
I've no idea what could have caused this, otherwise I would try to
reproduce it....
Any ideas?
Cheers,
Guenter
