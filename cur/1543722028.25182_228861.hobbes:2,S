Indeed, that was a bug. In our current tree we have this, which gets rid
of the superfluous quotes:
EXTRAVERSION = -$(shell echo $(CONFIG_RELEASE)-$(CONFIG_CFGNAME))
> KERNELRELEASE=$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION)

Well, it depends in which context you use the string, which is why we
didn't catch the bug for a long time. I agree that the quotes shouldn't
be there. Mistakes happen.

This test may often turn out not to be very useful: For example, we are
building modules for different kernels without booting into each of
those kernels. Cross-compiling is another case where the above test
doesn't work.
