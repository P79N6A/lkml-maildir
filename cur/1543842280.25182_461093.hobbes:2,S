The problem is that "asm/mman.h" is being included from entry.S indirectly
through "asm/pgtable.h" (see code snips below).
* arch/ia64/kernel/entry.S:
...
#include <asm/pgtable.h>
...
* include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:
...
#include <asm/mman.h>
...
* include/asm-ia64/mman.h
...
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define arch_mmap_check ia64_map_check_rgn
int ia64_map_check_rgn(unsigned long addr, unsigned long len,
                unsigned long flags);
#endif
...
Without this fix compilation is broken:
  gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/ia64/kernel/.entry.o.d  -nostdinc -isystem /usr/lib/gcc/ia64-linux-gnu/4.1.2/include -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude  -include include/linux/autoconf.h -DHAVE_WORKING_TEXT_ALIGN -DHAVE_MODEL_SMALL_ATTRIBUTE -DHAVE_SERIALIZE_DIRECTIVE -D__ASSEMBLY__   -mconstant-gp -c -o arch/ia64/kernel/entry.o arch/ia64/kernel/entry.S
include/asm/mman.h: Assembler messages:
include/asm/mman.h:13: Error: Unknown opcode `int ia64_map_check_rgn(unsigned long addr,unsigned long len,'
include/asm/mman.h:14: Error: Unknown opcode `unsigned long flags)'
