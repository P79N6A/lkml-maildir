There are two different kinds of error - the ones at the transport
level which we are able to force a result of "no sectors transferred"
for.  For all other errors and successful completions, the driver
reports "all sectors tranferred" since the driver level doesn't know
that an error occurred.
This causes us to tell the upper levels that we were successful,
even if we weren't.  Hence the problem.
