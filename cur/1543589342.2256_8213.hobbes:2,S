The thing that made me say we discussed this last month was Richard's
comment that it had already been implemented (which it has, by Andrea,
for x86-64.)  The idea of doing it for i386 has been kicked around for
years, originally as a way to handle INT 0x80 vs SYSENTER vs SYSCALL,
which I think is part of why it never got implemented, since handling
multiple flavours of system calls apparently causes some pain in the
system call entry/exit path.
The handling of a few things like gettimeofday etc. was something we
observed could be added on top at that time, but was largely
considered secondary.
