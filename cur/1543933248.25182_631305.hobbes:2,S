.. and I call BS on this claim.
/proc/slabinfo was (and is) totally pointless for "trying to eyeball 
what's going on". The output is totally unreadable, and useless. You end 
up with exactly the same script as above, except it reads as
	cat /proc/slabinfo | (read headerline
		while read name active num objsize objsperslab pagesperslab rest
		do
			realsize=$(( nul * objsize ))
			size=$(( active * objsize ))
			.. exact same rest of loop ..
		done | sort -n | ..
so no, "cat /proc/slabinfo" was almost never practical on its own.
The *one* advantage it does have is that you can forward it to others. 
That's a big advantage. But no, it wasn't ever readable for eyeballing, 
because it doesn't even give you a memory usage thing (just "number of 
objects and object size" as separate numbers).
But the "everything in one file" indubitably did make it a lot easier for 
just attaching it to bug-reports.

That's the only really ugly thing there. Otherwise, it's pretty nice, but 
having a million files makes for problems when trying to send somebody 
else the full info.
