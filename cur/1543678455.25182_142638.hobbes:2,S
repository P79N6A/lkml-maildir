Probably you'd like RH version numbering scheme more?
Do you think there is a big difference between, say, RH or Mandrake 9,
and Debian 3 (not sure about exact numbers)?

A vendor is for releasing alpha quality code? Well...

Not the money is the problem. I don't think the documentation costs
(much) money anyway. The NDA is the problem - why would you want
documentation if it prohibits you from releasing your (source) code?

Never worked for me reliably.
My experience is that under Linux no binary-only kernel modules work
reliably. Not that it's much different with (the) other OSes.
