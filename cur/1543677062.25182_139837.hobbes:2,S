If I am seeing this right this changes were introduced in -mm8 (i.e. I                                                                            
wanted to change the code and I saw the changes have already been done).                                                                          
In spite of that, when I boot -mm8 the device-mapper is very angry :)                                                                             
device-mapper ioctl cmd 2 failed:

This is hopefully written down from screen correct so that the error                                                                              
should be clear...
