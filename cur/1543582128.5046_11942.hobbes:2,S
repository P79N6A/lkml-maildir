Of course.
Just check the output after preprocessing.
It's 
	int entry;
	entry = *pte;
	entry &= ~_PAGE_CHG_MASK;
	entry |= pgprot_val(newprot)
	*pte = entry;
We need
	atomic_clear_mask (_PAGE_CHG_MASK, pte);
	atomic_set_mask (pgprot_val(newprot), *pte);
for multi threaded apps.

Correct, but we need a platform specific "update_pte", and perhaps
update_begin, update_end hooks (empty on i386) for other archs.
