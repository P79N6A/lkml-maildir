gregkh pointed out this as well and that is why I said that Maneesh's
patch may have taken kobjects in a different direction than what
it was intended earlier. I don't disagree with this and it may
very well be that dentry ageing will have to be done differently.

ISTR, a large number of files in sysfs are attributes which are leaves.
So, keeping a kobject tree partially connected using dentries as backing 
store as opposed to having everything connected might just be enough.
It will be looked into.
