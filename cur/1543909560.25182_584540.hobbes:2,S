Could you be a bit more specific? Where do you want to place the data?
What we are talking about is
atomic_inc(&zone->reclaim_cpu[smp_processor_id()]);
smp_wmb();
spin_lock(&zone->lru_lock);
....
spin_unlock(&zone_lru_lock);
smp_wmb();
atomic_dec(&zone->reclaim_cpu[smp_processor_id()]);
That is not light weight.
