Hi.
The speed difference depends of course upon the number of pages free and
the degree of fragmentation. I guess the easy answer is that it was
written and kept because it helped. Having talked to Andrew about the
use of page flags, I'll do some more changes before we put it to Linus -
I'll use a dynamically allocated bitmap instead of pageflags.
Regards,
Nigel
