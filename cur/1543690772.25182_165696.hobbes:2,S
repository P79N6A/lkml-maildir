	Sure, it could, but there's no particular reason to expect it to. The one
exception would be if another thread was already blocked waiting for that
particular pipe. In this case, your sending data on the pipe would unblock
that thread, which could trigger a pre-emption.

	Yes, but there's no reason that transition should cause the kernel to want
to change processes. The kernel generally tries to let processes complete
their timeslice. An exception could certainly be if the write to the pipe
causes a new thread to unblock and that that thread has a higher dynamic
priority (which it well might, since it was waiting).
	Personally, I don't think the kernel should ever pre-empt threads/processes
with equivalent static priorities, but that's another whole argument. ;)
