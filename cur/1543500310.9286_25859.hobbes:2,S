I don't get it. Why private? So less people compile it? So less configurations
get tested? You would be happy if the kernel just compiled, but didn't work?

Of course it doesn't. What's your point? Everybody who bothers to read
linux-kernel knows that it doesn't, and knows why it doesn't. If you want to
run a kernel that is on a development branch, that was moreover expressly
earmarked `Don't run this unless you're sure you can afford to trash your
system', you _do_ have to at least bother to read the mailing list.

You don't get it, do you? This isn't a release. Your complaints about
breakages in 2.2.x are perfectly valid. It sucks when something earmarked
stable starts corrupting your disk. Something's wrong with 2.2.9-10. And this
btw, shows why your model doesn't work very well: none of the `core developers'
can reproduce this problem on their hardware.

This is a problem with the development model of the kernel.  Some people do
prefer other styles. I do myself: I'd like read-only access to a CVS tree.
But Linus likes this one. End of argument.
