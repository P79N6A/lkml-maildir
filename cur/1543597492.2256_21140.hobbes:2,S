I am attempting to compile on a Dual Pentium Pro machines.  The make dep
runs fine but when I run the make I am getting the following errors:  I have
been working on this for two days now and have run out of options.  I have
checked all of the supporting tools and made sure they are up to date.
The errors are:
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.6/fs'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.6/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
