This is not DDR, it is SD-RAM (K6-2/300, 256MB SD-RAM in one stick).
But there is not much CPU traffic when making the files. The NFS-client
is doing the compression, but the corruption seems to happen on the
NFS-server (at least I can avoid it by turning off DMA on teh NFS
server), which has not got any special CPU usage at that time.

I will try to look into BIOS settings (it does not have a 'load failsafe
option' IIRC, but I'm pretty sure I can change RAM timings) - but I
won't be near the machine before tomorrow.
