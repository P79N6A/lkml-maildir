I've been doing more work on the driver.  Wednesday, I was
going crazy because the data I read back from the device
was SOMETIMES NOT the same data I wrote there.
On Thursday, I switched from Linux 2.5.34 to Linux 2.5.36.
Now, the driver reads back the same data it wrote.  There must
have been some bio changes in 2.5.36.  2.5.36 also
calls the driver shutdown notifier routine, which 2.5.34 didn't.
This uncovered a coding bug that causes a kernel OOPS during shutdown.
That'll be fixed in the next patch.
I'm about to test changes that put the command and status memory
mailboxes into dma memory regions.  Once I've tested that,
I'll send you a new patch (Probably on Monday after week end
testing).
After that, I'll change the status reporting structures to be in dma
memory regions.  Expect a patch containing that maybe the end of
next week, or the Monday following ( September 30).
