What about not being able to unmount a filesystem that was once
exported, but now it's not? I've been experiencing this problem since a
long time ago:
I have a volume/partition exported via NFS:
/data           192.168.0.100(rw,no_root_squash) 192.168.0.0/24(ro)
However, during shutdown (it's a RH9 box), I do get "can't unmount,
device is busy" errors while unmounting this filesystem *after* the NFS
server has been stopped and all shares unexported.
This does only occurs if the shared NFS volume has been used by other
clients on the LAN. If no client tries to mount/use the share, this
doesn't happen.
Anyways, I'm having problems with NFS on 2.5... many programs fail when
accessing files over NFS, normally, programs that perform heavy file
seeks, writes and reads, like "oggdec" or "lame". They usually can't
complete without exitting with errors.
More information can be provided on detail :-)
