Hi Paul,
Thank you for your reply.
I am currently auditing all the interrupt handlers and related code
(request_irq(), free_irq(), and others of that ilk) and, in the process,
I found some dead code. Getting rid of this cruft would just make my
life easier.
The final goal of this audit is to determine whether the Linux interrupt
handlers are kdump-ready. With the advent of kdump it is now possible
that device drivers have to handle pending interrupts generated in the
context of a previous kernel. Any pending interrupts will come in as
soon as the IRQ is allocated, but, unfortunately, not all the device
drivers handle this situation properly.
Besides, I am also trying to determine if applying this patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/19/687
is a sane thing to do.

As Linas mentioned in his reply, cleaning things up first will probably
make things easier for you too.
Please consider merging the four patches I sent to the PPC mailing list.
