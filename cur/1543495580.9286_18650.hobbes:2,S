Hi, guys!
Sorry that I have no dump of the OOPS!
Let me tell you the story!
(Below you have my configuration.)
I compile a 2.2.7 kernel and i boot. After 5-10 minutes, I got an OOPS in
swaper. I rebooted and the system works great.
The same thing with 2.2.8, but this time I just edit a file.
With 2.2.5 I haven't this problem! 2.2.5 is stable that 2.2.7 and 2.2.8.
I have a:
	- dual Pentium II AGP/PCI/333 MHz
	- mo Intel i82440LX
	- 196 MB Ram
	- 1 x AIC-7880
	- 2 x 3C905b
	- 1 x Cyclom YeP
	- 1 ESS1869 Sound Card
Kernel is 2.2.[78].
We are an ISP.
Thanks!
