William, can you explain please this effect more precisely ?
What does mean "the other task will have to wait" ?
That the other task will not be scheduled until the inode freeing is finished,
while the other runs fine ?
How does the old 2.2.10-lowlatencyN6B kernel react to these 2 SCHED_FIFO
tasks ?
