Checkin 464bdd33e9baad9806c7adbd8dfc37081a55f27e "fbdev: ignore VESA
modes if framebuffer is disabled" is just plain wrong on any system
which has support for extended text modes in its VESA BIOS.
Antonio is incorrectly assuming this branchout is used only to set VESA
graphics modes, but it's to set any VESA mode, be it text or graphics.
