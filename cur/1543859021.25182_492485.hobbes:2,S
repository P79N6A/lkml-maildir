> Can we achieve smooth write times in Linux?
if you want truely really smooth writes you'll have to work for it,
since "bumpy" writes tend to be better for performance so naturally the
kernel will favor those.
to get smooth writes you'll need to do a threaded setup where you do an
msync/fdatasync/sync_file_range on a frequent-but-regular interval from
a thread. Be aware that this is quite likely to give you lower maximum
performance than the batching behavior though.
