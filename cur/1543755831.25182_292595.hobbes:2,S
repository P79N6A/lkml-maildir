I would disable rx/tx checksums on the cards to ensure that's not a bug
in this part. Because one reason to see what you encounter would be that
some frames are corrupted at gigabit speed (possibly on one of the cards
themselves), and they don't correctly compute the checksum on the receive
side, or they ignore when it's bad.
IIRC, you can do this with ethtool :
  # ethtool -K rx off tx off
