So, this one has been reported by me before on 2.5.62 and 2.5.63. I just
enabled kksymoops, so I'd get maybe some more complete info.
It has been very reproducable on my motorola powerstack 2 mobo. I just
boot, and try to ping my default gateway. Well, there is no reply, and
the gateway never sees the ping requests. DHCP does sem to work, because
the my little testbox does get the correct IP, and I do see the DHCP
reply's on the wire (the requests must be there as well, I just don't
see them because I had to filter the tcpdump).
Well, after a few failed pings, when I unplug the ethernet:
flops:~# eth1: 10baseT-HD link ok, status ffffffc8                      
       
eth1: link down                                                         
       
eth1: timeout expired stopping DMA

Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!                                 
In interrupt handler - not syncing                                            
Hope any of you know how to fix this... For this box, the ethernet not working 
is currently the only part that doesn't seem to work in the current 2.5 kernel.
