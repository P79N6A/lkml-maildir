i the patch in fact enables this too: you can more agressively get irqs
and softirqs executed by increasing max_rate just above the 'critical'
rate you can measure. (and the blocked-interrupts period of time will be
enough to let the softirq work to be finished.) So in fact you might even
end up having higher performance by blocking interrupts in a certain
portion of a timer tick - backlogged work will be processed. Via max_rate
you can partition the percentage of CPU time dedicated to softirq and
process work. (which in your case would be softirq-only work - which
should not be underestimated either.)
