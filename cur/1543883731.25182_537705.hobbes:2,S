Hi Mike,
first of all thank you for explainig us all the context - well done!
I spent some 4 hours yesterday to try to find a compromise solution as Trent Piepho ignored my criticism, which is no fine behaviour at all.
Even if you do not believe I even managed to nearly complete a compromise, making dvb-pll.c deselectable for both of the v4l layers.
I only stumbled over line 614 of module dvb-bt8xx.c in current 2.6.21-git2 kernel.
For this static dependency concerning support for the Fusion HDTV 5 Lite card I did not manage to find out a solution how to get rid of.
I think I will send my stuff to Markus who already offered to help me to work this out.
So there is no "small price to pay" at all if one knows how to resolve it. It's quite simple in fact - I am just missing the appropriate thought kick.

Again I state:
I haven't found any unresolved symbols caused by my DST deselection patches.
Even if Mauro Chehab repeats that like a parrot it is like an air bubble on my testing side: empty, non existant, wrong!
