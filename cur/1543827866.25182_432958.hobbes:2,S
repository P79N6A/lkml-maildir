Linux follows the standards draft.  SO_REUSEPORT is fairly obscure
BSDism.

That doesn't actually prove very much. Its very easy to write incorrect
code that only works on one system, especially when endian-ness gets
involved with network code.
In particular if writing portable code you must remember to join the
group. You must also remember that the various htons/htonl macros need
to be correctly used or your code will break on little-endian systems.
The default IP_MULTICAST_LOOP value is probably also worth overriding if
you are being fairly paranoid.
