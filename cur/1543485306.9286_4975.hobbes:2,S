	CLONE_PID isn't really implemented yet.  For it to be correctly
implemented, we need a 'TID' (thread ID) field also, so that different
threads in the same process can be distinguished.  I believe that
functionality is considered a 2.3 job...
	After TIDs get implemented, then I suppose people will be more
motivated to do a clean sweep of the multithreading code, and fix any
tiny bugs.  
	Actually, I don't know much about this.  Don't use it, haven't read the
source.  But I was interested in writing a multithreaded program at one
time...  I suppose you have read the information at the LinuxTHreads
homepage?
