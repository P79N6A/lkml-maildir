This is a great idea, thanks.
What I'm not clear on is where this is intended to go?
The below isn't a patch, so if it's intended to live on a website
rather than in the kernel tarball, great. We probably want a link from
the in-kernel HOWTO to that website.
If it is intended to live in the kernel tarball, I'm not sure that's a
good idea. There are a number of languages we could consider
translating these and other documents into.
