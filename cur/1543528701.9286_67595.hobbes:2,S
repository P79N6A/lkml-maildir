I use my Linux box as a desktop. So I usually don't want the memory hog
(NetScape) dead. Most of the time I've gotten OOM, it's been because of
a moderately (or sometimes quickly) growing program, not because of
something going beserk.
And anything that can spiral out of control, you'd of course set to a
high-numbered memory priority -- that way, it'd be killed first. While
you'd set the other things to a lower-numbered memory priority.
This set up could work nicely, for example, on a webserver, too. Apache
would keep it's memory priority as 0, whiile any CGI's it spawns would
be given 1. It'd probably work for others servers that spawn processes,
too.
I imagine a lot of the time the memory-hungry process and the
lower-priority process might corespond, though.
