This is the exact configuration of one of the users who reported the
problem on LAU.  Got a pointer to the patch?  And what's the issue with
IN transfers?

Unlikely because it works under Windows.  We're not all that far behind
however; USB audio on that OS did not really work until XP SP1.  Also,
if that were a widespread problem we would be seeing problems with PCI

Also please fix the threading in your email client.
