OK, I'll take care of that.
After talking with akpm, it sounds as though some of the nasty aspects
of "select" in Kconfig rules can be avoided as long as no config
option is controlled by both "select" and "depends". So I'll probably
go back to making things like CONFIG_CPUSETS select CONFIG_CGROUPS,
and enforce that CONFIG_CGROUPS can't depend on anything.
