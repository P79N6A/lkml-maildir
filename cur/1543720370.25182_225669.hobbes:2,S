See you there.

PS.  Get the official MINIX sources, and use a XX-to-YY translator or
write your own that converts the assembler sources to NASM.  It
shouldn't be that difficult., or do it by hand, since there's not much
of it.  The C code is ANSI and GCC should handle it.  Then you can
rewrite the Makefiles and possibly add linker scripts for LD, and you'll
have MINIX built on Linux in no time.
