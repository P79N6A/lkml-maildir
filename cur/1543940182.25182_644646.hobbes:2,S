Actually NFS was just one example. I cannot remember of a top of my head what else was there
but there are definitely other users of work queues that expect all the threads to run at
some point in time.
Also if you think about it. The patch does _exactly_ what you propose. It removes workqueue 
threads from isolated CPUs. But instead of doing just for NFS and/or other subsystems 
separately it just does it in a generic way by simply not starting those threads in first 
place.

100% agree. That's why I said mentioned that this patches is controversial in the first place. 
Right now those short from rewriting module loading to not use stop machine there is no other 
option. I'll think some more about it. If you guys have other ideas please drop me a note.
Thanx
