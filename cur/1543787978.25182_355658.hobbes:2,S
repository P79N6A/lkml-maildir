Hello, Zwane!

Okay, I've tried the latest linux' git tree from friday last week:
2.6.14-rc3-something, but the
c010fdd5    send_IPI_mask_bitmask+0x65/0x70
c0110236    smp_send_reschedule+0x16/0x20 
still occurs when I want to do a "shutdown -h now".
A reboot or "shutdown -r now" seems to work without any errors (or at least
I cannot see any until the graphcs card get re-initialized)!
All that is on a Tyan Tomcat IIID (S1563D) machine, w/ the latest BIOS (4.02)
APM and ACPI are currently disabled...
Unfortunately, I have had a severe two-at-a-time hard-disk crash on another
machine, which kept me quite busy the last days. :-(
Hopefully, by the end of this week, I will be able to debug into that more...
Can you give me a pointer to some code, where the kernel actually splits
up in between rebooting and halting the system?
Thanks,
