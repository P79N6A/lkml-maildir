Perhaps this is related (from 2.4.10-acX thread later on l-k):

Read the ll_rw_blk diff. Basically it tries to avoid too many locked
buffers clogging up memory and killing the box. I'm not totally sure its
the right approach.

Were there recent changes in ll_rw_blk which are being addressed by
"Elevator flow control"?  As suggested earlier in this thread, the cause
might be a few layers up, and this seemed relevant.
Can anyone confirm or shed any additional light on this?
