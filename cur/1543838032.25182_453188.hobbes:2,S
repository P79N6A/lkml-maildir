Subject: module compiler version check still needed?

Does anybody know of any reason why we would still need the compiler version
check during module loading? AFAIK on i386 it was only needed to handle
2.95 (which got dropped) and on x86-64 it was never needed. Is there
a need on any other architecture for it?
