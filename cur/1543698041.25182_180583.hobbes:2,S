Yes, that would be a good idea, it would be even nice to automatically
save the partition table the first time parted access the harddisk. The
problem is that it needs to be saved on a separate harddisk though, or
printed or something such.
The partition table saving/restoring would be part of the partition
table specific code, so you could know the logical partitions or
whatever your precise non-mbr partition table mandates.
