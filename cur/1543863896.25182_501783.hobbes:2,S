Completely depends on the system hardware and BIOS.

Not usually. Sometimes some SMIs can be disabled via BIOS options.

Yes. The kernel has no notification that the SMI occurred.

Also do check the -rt tree as Ingo suggested. I mis-read your earlier
email and thought you were running it.

vsyscalls are only supported on x86_64/powerpc (I think) right now.
glibc support is necessary, and right now its only for gettimeofday()
not clock_gettime().

Yea, unfortunately the ACPI PM is much slower then the TSC.
However, the TSC is often unstable, so you might not be able to utilize
it.
You can play around w/ the "idle=poll" boot option to see if that allows
you to use it, but that will up your power usage and has possible
thermal risks.
