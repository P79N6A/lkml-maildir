Hi,
What's the difference between msleep_interruptible and msleep ?
If I understand correctly the main difference between msleep and 
msleep_interruptible is that msleep_interruptible can return if there is 
a pending signal ?
But why if I have a kernel thread that do [1] :
while (true) {
Do some stuff
msleep(1000)
}
the load average is high (near 100%).
and if I use msleep_interruptible the load average is normal.
Does the same applies to wait_event_timeout vs 
wait_event_interruptible_timeout ?
Thanks,
Matthieu CASTET
