Hi,
my NFS server seems not to utilize the read-ahead feature, my exported
dir is located on ext3 fs over sata disk. the sata controller can
issue commands up to 1MB, also I modified the read ahead under the sys
to 1MB. but when the client do reads in 32KB chunks (rsize), I can see
in the server side that all IOs are ~32KB. my kernel version is
2.6.22.7.
according to the nfsd code, the NFS server should utilize the
read-ahead feature, but what should I do
to make it work?
