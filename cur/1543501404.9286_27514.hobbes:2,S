If you could clarify: suppose I had an albod (written by KWord or
whatever). Will I still be able to use my existing tools such that the
directory appears as a directory (i.e. for stat() and open()
purposes)?
Another question, since it hasn't been made clear to me: which
problem(s) are you trying to solve by adding new semantics for
directories?
I'm assuming the new semantics are that read(2)ing a directory yields
the "default" data fork (is this assumption correct?).
