1. Read the patch.  All of it.
2. Virtually the same identical variables are stuffed into the stack
frames of:
o mhz_mfc_config,
o mhz_setup,
o mot_setup,
o smc_setup,
o osi_setup and
o smc91c92_config.
That is six functions.  If it were just one, I would definitely agree
with you.  For two functions, well, it wouldn't really matter either
way.  But should six functions all copy the exact same struct six
different times instead of referencing a single globally defined one?
Naa, that's barely an advantage.

If you would actually like to do something, please provide further
patches to that driver.  It sucks.  It sucks so bad, that it's hardly
possible to change anything without improving it.  There are much
grosser things to clean up than the one we're discussing right now.
