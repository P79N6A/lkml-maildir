RFC 1122 :)

Your interpretation is essentially correct, but has been amended by modern
style Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), where the old concept of
class A-C nets is essentially thrown away, making 192.168.0.0/16 the net
number, if you then don't subnet it 192.168.0.1 WILL be a valid host,
since the host portion is 0.1
Courses on TCP/IP still blabber on about how class A-C nets are different,
but that's essentially useless knowledge nowadays, used only by lazy or
ignorant teachers because it's easy to grade on and they confuse memorised
facts with understanding.

Modern routing code has no knowledge of the different classes (apart from 
multicasting), and is entierly using the netmask.
