I've had an identical argument with Linus about lib/zlib_*.  He
decided that he didn't care about diverging, I went ahead and changed
the code.  In the process, I merged a couple of outstanding bugfixes
and reduced memory consumption by 25%.  Looks like Linus was right on
that one.

Dito in lib/zlib_*.  lib/inflage.c is only used for the various
in-kernel bootloaders to uncompress a kernel image.  Anyone tampering
with the image to cause a buffer overrun already owns the machine
anyway.
Whether any of our experiences with zlib apply to lzo remains a
question, though.
