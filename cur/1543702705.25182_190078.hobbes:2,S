I get the same behaviour. The 0x37ffffff is from the place where MAXMEM 
is used (the ramdisk_max variable in setup.S); it subtracts one from the 
value. It turns out that the error only occurs when the value is used in 
a data definition. Experimentally found first value for which it gives 
the error is:
ramdisk_max: .long ~(0x80000000)
Interestingly, it doesn't occur for 0x7fffffff. I've taken a look at gas 
to see where it goes wrong, but my newly built version doesn't exhibit 
this behaviour -- it compiles the above statement without warnings. It 
might have to do with the differences between the build environment that 
the Debian binutils package is built in and my own machine -- I'll do 
some more investigating.
