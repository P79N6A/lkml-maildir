Yep. It is Standard. If you want to forget POSIX, just say so. I'd like to
meet the standard, but if we don't... might as well kill some other POSIX
junk as well. Being almost-POSIX isn't worth much.

Go bitch to the IEEE.

This should be obvious, but: threads, signals, and the use of multiple
processes are all kludges. Die, die die!!! :-) Blocking system calls
are crap, and interruptible calls are extreme crap. It is better to
go with something a bit more like SCSI. One could fire off system calls
in groups, finish some useful work, then wait for completion of any
system calls whose results are needed.

That will die (assuming those are supposed to be threads) as soon
as I figure out how to get a unique VM ID from userspace and find
the time to fix ps.
Every system I know with real threads (AIX, Digital UNIX, SunOS, UnixWare)
provides an option to list threads separately, so I don't see your point.
You should be familiar with Sun's "-L" option.

Clearly yes. The system must meet normal expectations.

Well, updated at least. The kernel and libc needed updates too.
Your point?

Huh? Without OS support, you don't have clone() or threads at all.
All of this stuff needs OS support, libc support, and system software
support.
I'd love to add support for /proc files like Solaris has, but we have
some fundamental incompatibilities AFAIK and /proc/*/status is taken.
