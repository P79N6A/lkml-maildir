I think Scott may be on to something.  There are several reports that P9
does not work on SMP machines at all - it either doesn't boot, locks up
the first time there is heavy IRQ activity (starting KDE), or locks up
as soon as the first RT process is run.  This is exactly the behavior
that would be expected if Scott is correct.  See this thread:
http://ccrma-mail.stanford.edu/pipermail/planetccrma/2004-August/005899.html
Does anyone have P9 working on SMP?  Fernando, can you see if M5 works
on SMP?  If this works it would seem that the preemptible IRQs are the
problem.
