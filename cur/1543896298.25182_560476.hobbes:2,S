After the successful Embedded Linux Conference in San Jose earlier
this year, it's time for an event targeted at the European embedded
Linux community!
The CE Linux Forum would like to invite you to make a presentation
at our upcoming Embedded Linux Conference - Europe.
The conference will be held November 2 and 3 in Linz, Austria, in
conjunction with the 9th Real Time Linux Workshop.
See 
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/ELCEurope2007
for more information.
= Guidelines =
Presentations should be of a technical nature, covering topics
related to use of Linux in embedded systems.
The CE Linux Forum is focused on the use of Linux in consumer
electronics products, but presentations may cover use of Linux
in other embedded areas, as long as the topic is of general
relevance to most embedded users.
Presentations that are commercial advertisements or sales
pitches are not appropriate for this conference.
Presentations on the following topics are encouraged:
   * Audio, Video, and Graphics systems for embedded products
   * Security
   * System size
   * Bootup time
   * Meeting real-time constraints
   * Power management
   * Streaming media
   * Flash memory devices and filesystems
   * Technologies related to cell phones, digital settop boxes,
     handheld devices, or other CE products
   * Development tools for embedded users
   * Use of Linux in actual products, practical experience and
     war stories
   * Standards for CE products
A paper submission is NOT required in conjunction with
the presentation. However, if a paper is produced, it is
requested to be published on the Embedded Linux Wiki,
in MediaWiki format. (
http://www.elinux.org
)
You may also submit a request to present a tutorial.
Tutorials are intended to be longer, interactive learning
sessions. A tutorial may occupy more than one session
slot at the conference.
We prefer presentations that have not been previously
presented. Exceptions will be made for material that is
either of great interest or has been seen previously only
by a limited audience, like e.g. (updated) key presentations
of ELC 2007, San Jose.
For examples of presentations from previous conferences, see:
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/ELC2006Presentations
 and
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/CelfPubWiki/ELC2007Presentations
= Deadlines =
Proposals for presentations, demos and Birds-of-a-Feather
sessions must be received by August 11, 2007.
Speakers will be notified by September 15, 2007.
Full details, including the e-mail address to use to submit a proposal, are at:
