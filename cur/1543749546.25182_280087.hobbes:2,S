Hmmm, unfortunately I did not changes in that area. Perhaps memory

Using regular vga console and digital camera seems to be popular way
to get dumps. I'm not sure why swsusp critical section interferes with
serial, perhaps serial console support has to "know" about serial
console and not suspend it during suspend() call?
