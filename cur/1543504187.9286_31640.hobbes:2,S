We are having the exact same problem with our web server.  Running
Redhat 6.0, kernel 2.2.10.  The only difference is that we didn't use
linuxconf to configure our aliases, we just wrote the following script:
#!/usr/bin/perl
# -*- Perl -*-
$min = 10;
$max = 199;
for ( $i = $min; $i <= $max; $i++) {
	system("/sbin/ifconfig eth0:$i 209.50.110.$i");
	system("/sbin/route add -host 209.50.110.$i dev eth0:$i");
}
Same setup worked with 2.0.34 for at least the last year.

BUT, that is ONLY the case if you have not had communicate with the actual -real- interface.... i.e. accessed 's2' directly, instead of one of the aliased ip's configured there...
