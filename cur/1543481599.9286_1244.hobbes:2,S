	Yes, I realize it would be impossible to keep all of them documented,
	but I would think that at least the basic ioctl's (say for changing baud on
	a serial port) would be fairly static and those the documentation would
	stay correct
Contributions to man pages like ioctl_list.2 and console_ioctl[s].4
are welcome.
