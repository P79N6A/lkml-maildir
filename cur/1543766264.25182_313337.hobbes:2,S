But the real problem is that you expect your editor to be smart enough 
to diddle permissions (some aren't) or create a new file (some aren't 
that either).
It sounds as if you're kind of using the wrong tool here, frankly.
You also don't understand hard links, they don't hide anything, the 
inode number is there, which is exactly as much information as is in the 
original link. And they are lots safer, since you can't wind up with 
them pointing to a non-existent file, get them in circular loops, etc. 
Okay, YOU probably wouldn't, but believe me semi-competent users 
regularly these things.
