Hi,
sorry for the broken threading, I read this in the archives.
My RNG worked with the older kernel 2.6.18-1.2200.fc5
I booted this kernel and made the following tests:
hexdump -v /dev/hw_random
here is the beginning of the output:
0000000 a7ff 1dff b312 0be0 64c9 8f83 9082 7d94
0000010 ac03 c513 ac1b b502 b93e 8f34 1a05 d417
0000020 b9cc c5d5 345f e6f6 d84b 333c c156 9007
0000030 0539 b145 7fdc 071b ea10 9145 c395 5536
0000040 7942 f8a2 f07d a5ea 2c76 a934 742c 1288
0000050 925a f710 67e6 8f68 ece2 bb23 536d bebe
0000060 1ad3 ab94 ab7b 54c9 8ce3 adaa 7f79 edd7
0000070 4c5b 0a28 66ee bc8d 90ae 0515 353e dcf5
These Numbers seem random to me :)
rngtest produces the following output:
[root@kra:~] rngtest -t1 </dev/hw_random 
rngtest 2
