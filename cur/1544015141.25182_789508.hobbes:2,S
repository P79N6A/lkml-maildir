Ugh, I think you're right.  I'll revert this (and all of the patches in
the series that were needed to get this working properly), and redo the
patch set, first making device_initialize() able to fail, and auditing
all callers to make sure it's not being called in atomic context.
At first glance, I think it's only firewire that is doing this in atomic
context, so Stefan, I wouldn't mind seeing your patch go in as-is just
to make things simpler overall.
I'll go make up the patchset and send them to Linus...
