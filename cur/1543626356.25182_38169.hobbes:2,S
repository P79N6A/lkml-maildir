Ok, I tested (and repeated for consistancy to prevent repeat of
unfortunate premature results) 2.4.19-pre5 and 2.4.19pre5aa1.
I didn't get my write throughput back (oh well), but I do NOT
see any bad behavior.  IO looks/feels good in both kernels.
Only thing interesting during testing was that 2.4.19pre5aa1
lost by a consistant ~15% in the move a tree around test.
(if I find anything interesting on the 2.5 thingy, I'll let you
know offline)
