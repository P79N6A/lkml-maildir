Subject: cannot get clean 2.4.20 kernel to compile

Hi,
I have downloaded the 2.4.20 kernel from ftp.kernel.org, have checked its sign, and no matter what I try I cannot get it to compile.
I do a make mrproper, I then do make dep which is fine, but then i try "make bzImage modules modules_install", selecting all the defaults, and get an SMP header error:

I then disable SMP support and get:
http://rafb.net/paste/results/muYA9t12.html
I even tried using my config from the 2.4.32 kernel which works perfectly fine, and I also get the sched errors.
I'd greatly appreciate any help.  Using a different kernel is not an option, I need to use the 2.4.20 kernel for a project that a module was written and tested on.
Thanks!
Geirge
