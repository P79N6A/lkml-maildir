I noticed these.  Do you have a pointer to documentation on this API?
Another thing I noticed.  Which is better, __u32 or struct in_addr and
int?  Both are used in include/linux/in.h for what appear to be the
same objects:
struct ip_mreq 
{
	struct in_addr imr_multiaddr;	/* IP multicast address of group */
	struct in_addr imr_interface;	/* local IP address of interface */
};
struct ip_mreqn
{
	struct in_addr	imr_multiaddr;		/* IP multicast address of group */
	struct in_addr	imr_address;		/* local IP address of interface */
	int		imr_ifindex;		/* Interface index */
};
struct ip_mreq_source {
	__u32		imr_multiaddr;
	__u32		imr_interface;
	__u32		imr_sourceaddr;
};
struct ip_msfilter {
	__u32		imsf_multiaddr;
	__u32		imsf_interface;
	__u32		imsf_fmode;
	__u32		imsf_numsrc;
	__u32		imsf_slist[1];
};

Thank you for clarifying.  I only wish the userspace was caught up.
