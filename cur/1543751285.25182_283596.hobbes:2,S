Im having the same issue on a 2.6.9 kernel ...
Dell PowerEdge 2650 /w Adaptec AACRaid 
In hardware Raid 0 (stripe array)
am finding that some of the earlier 2.6  kernels were
a bit more stable ... 
only seem to get input/output & bus errors when
high load is present on the system ... e.g. Backup ... 
Thanx ...
