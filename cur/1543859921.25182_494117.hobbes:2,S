Some things for the testers to try, please:
- mount the fs with ext2 with the no-buffer-head option.  That means either:
  grub.conf:  rootfstype=ext2 rootflags=nobh
  /etc/fstab: ext2 nobh
- mount the fs with ext3 data=writeback, nobh
  grub.conf:  rootfstype=ext3 rootflags=nobh,data=writeback  (I hope this works)
  /etc/fstab: ext2 data=writeback,nobh
if that still fails we can rule out buffer_head funnies.
