Which is a good reason for USER_HZ to be the same as HZ.

These programs could (and should) use sysconfig(_SC_CLK_TCK) to find out 
how many ticks there are in a second so this does not constitute a good 
reason for USER_HZ not being equal to HZ.
BTW, in ignorance of sysconfig(_SC_CLK_TCK) and because of statements to 
the same effect in Robert Love's book, I had been assuming that this was 
the reason for USER_HZ and HZ not being equal.  But now that I've been 
told about sysconfig(_SC_CLK_TCK) I can see no valid reason.  That 
doesn't mean that there aren't any but the reasons you've advanced 
certainly aren't them.
