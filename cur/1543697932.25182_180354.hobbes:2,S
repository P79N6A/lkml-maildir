Well, running 2.6.0-test11, I just discovered I'm back to being unable 
to 'su amanda' again.  It worked the first time, but I got rejected 
frorm unpacking the lastest amanda-2.4.4p1-20031126.tar.gz due to a 
lack of permissions, so I exited, chowned the archive to what it was 
supposed to be, but cannot now do another su amanda in order to start 
the install of this latest snapshot.
The process just hangs, never comeing back to a prompt.  I never had 
any troubles with that useing test9, so I guess its reboot time 
again.
However, IMO this is a major problem, and needs fixed before 2.6.0.
