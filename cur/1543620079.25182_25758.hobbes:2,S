Hi!,
I've just compile the kernel 2.4.17 in my linux 7.2 and installed it in my 
embedded device running 2.2.18. I have followed all the instructions about 
make modules install_modules and so on.
-> I have the modutils 2.1.121.
-> I have the modules in
       /lib/modules/2.2.17/...
-> and I have also updated my modules.conf with the new paths, something like:
      path[drivers]=/lib/modules/2.4.17/kernel/drivers/
      path[net]=/lib/modules/2.4.17/kernel/net/
    and so on
Errors:
-> My modules.dep is empty, and I know I have several dependencies and depmod 
-a is executed while loading.
-> If I use insmod with the absolute path, then it works, but if I try to use 
modprobe, it does not work ( can't locate module...).
-> When I use modprobe -c I get three differents paths for each 
modue:
   path[drivers]=/lib/modules/2.4.17/kernel/drivers/
   ...
   path[drivers]=/lib/modules
   ....
   path[drivers]=/lib/modules/default
So, What happens here? Is there any other file still storing the old paths 
and I should modify it? Are these paths stored in the kernel itself so is 
impossible to change then?
Thanks in advance.
