Please find a way to get your patch queue into linux-next so that others
get some visibility into what you're brewing earlier than
last-day-of-the-merge-window?
Also, when emailing patches like this I do think that it's best that they
be sequence-numbered, even if they are all non-overlapping and unrelated. 
Because it allows the recipient to check that none got lost.
Thanks.
