If X86_GENERICARCH is not breaking anything, why does X86_PC exist? If
you say X86_GENERICARCH is okay for everyone, at least help texts need
to be fixed.
config X86_PC
        bool "PC-compatible"
        help
          Choose this option if your computer is a standard PC or compatible.
config X86_BIGSMP
        bool "Support for other sub-arch SMP systems with more than 8 CPUs"
        depends on SMP
        help
          This option is needed for the systems that have more than 8 CPUs
          and if the system is not of any sub-arch type above.
          If you don't have such a system, you should say N here.
I certainly have PCtype machine here, and definitely not more than 8 CPUs.

At least config texts need to be fixed if you want people to use
X86_BIGSMP. And why keep X86_PC when X86_BIGSMP works as well?
