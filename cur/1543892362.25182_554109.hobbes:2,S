I can see several problems with that:
- - experimental implementers might choose domain values which definitely
won't collide with others
- - the flags parameter ideally allows using the same values used for
open's mode argument.  The lowest value I can see making sense is
O_NONBLOCK (04000).
- - how to recognize kernels without the support?  -EAFNOSUPPORT can also
with new kernels mean it's actually the domain which is wrong
- - there might be new flags we want to use over time
I would strongly argue that any change we're doing in this area at
userlevel would involve a new interface.  Programs also need new
definitions from headers files.  This means a recent enough glibc will
be needed in any case.  Unless programs use their own definitions in
which case they might as well use the syscall() function.
