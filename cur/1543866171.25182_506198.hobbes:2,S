unless we exclude mlocked dirty pages from NR_DIRTY accounting, which

NR_DIRTY is only used for write throttling, right?  well, and
reporting to user-space, but again, i suggest that user space should
get to see NR_MLOCKED as well.  would people flip out if NR_DIRTY
stopped showing pages that are mlocked, as long as a seperate
NR_MLOCKED variable was present?

i'd be wary of a VM algorithm that treated mlocked pages any
differently than, say, unreclaimable slab pages.  but there are no
concrete suggestions yet, so i won't comment further.
all this is not to say that i dislike the idea of keeping mlocked
pages off the LRU, quite the opposite i've been looking for this for a
while and was hoping that Stone Wang's wired list patch
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/20/128
) would get further than it did.
but i don't see the need to keep strict accounting if it hurts
performance in the common case.
