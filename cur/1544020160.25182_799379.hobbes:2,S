Hang on.  You said
  That's typically for softirq vs non softirq, which is important for
  the network stack.
that's what in_softirq() does.
Now, if networking is indeed using in_atomic() to detect
are-we-inside-a-spinlock then networking is buggy.
If networking is _not_ doing that then we can safely switch it to
in_sortirq() or in_interrupt().  And this would reenable the bug
detection which networking's use of in_atomic() accidentally
suppressed.
