Heh,. I didn't much look at the git numbers, since I knew those were 
supposed to be linear in the size of the patch...

Yes. I have my "tools" scripts for git in
	kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/torvalds/git-tools.git
and I sent out the script I used to test the 2.6.12-rc2 + patches stuff in 
the previous email, so you would just have to edit my mbox-applicator 
tools to work with hg and get comparable numbers.

That should work.

Getting a bunch of SHA's means that the file contents match, but that your 
index file wasn't up-to-date, so git had to actually uncompress the object 
backing store and _compare_ the file contents to notice.
And I suspect that you may have done _all_ your numbers without ever
having initialized the git index, in which case git will really suck raw
eggs, because git will basically always re-read every file (it will never
realize that they are up-to-date already).
Basically, the theory of git operation is that the index file should
_always_ be up-to-date.  Normally you don't have to do anything about it,
since the git helper tools will always just keep it that way, but if you
didn't, then..
