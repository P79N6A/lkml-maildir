If a task has restricted its memory allocation to one node and does 
excessive allocations then that process needs to die not other processes 
that are harmlessly running on the node and that may not be allocating 
memory at the time.

People are accustomed of having random processes killed? <shudder>

We are terminating processes perform restricted allocations. Restricted 
allocations are only possible on NUMA boxes so the phrase "numa boxes 
using some form of memory constraint" is a tautology. OOM killing makes 
sense for global allocations if the system is really tight on memory and 
survival is the main goal even if he have to cannibalize processes. 
However, cannibalism is still a taboo.
