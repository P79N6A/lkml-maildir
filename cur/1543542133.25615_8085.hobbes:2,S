are you asking wether there are waitqueues in the 2.2? Yes, of course,
waitqueues were around and were the primary process-wakeup mechanism since
around 1992 or so.

my point is that you lose future optimizations (already in my kernel) done
at the wake_up() level.

well, if you do your own locking then yes. With waitqueues you need no
extra locking as far as thread exits go, and they are more generic.
wake_up_process() is used only a few very specific and kernel-internal
cases.
