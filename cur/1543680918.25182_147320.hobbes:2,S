	While I'm sure I don't have a grasp of "the big picture", I would have 
imagines these would have acted like a mask against the file system 
attributes.  In effect setting O_RDONLY would clear the write permission bits 
read by stat(), and O_WRONLY would clear the read permission bits.  O_RDONLY 
+ O_WRONLY (O_RDWR) would leave the permissions alone.  These would be 
applied somewhere around the may_open() call in fs/open_namei.c
	A poor mans umaks(), I guess.
