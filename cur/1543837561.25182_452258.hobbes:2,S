An unmount will flush out anything that is dirty anyway.  Memory
pressure is easier, it usually don't have to flush everything,
only enough to satisfy the memory requests.
Of course you can have some mechanism that trickles out writes
of half-dirty stuff.  Similiar to how dirty stuff is flushed, but with
a much lower frequency.
