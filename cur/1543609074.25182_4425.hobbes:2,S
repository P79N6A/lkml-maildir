I am sorry, but I still don't see the difference. I wrote a small program
with different
cases, but the values still come same irrespective of the input arguments
to the
checks. Could you tell under what conditions the checks wuold fail ? The
2's
complement  works the same for addition and subtraction. I have included
the
test program below.
Thanks,

     if (jiffies <= start + HZ) {
