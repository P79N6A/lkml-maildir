Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but shouldn't this just be the same
check to see if the page can be swapped out or discarded? Surely any page
that can be swapped out or discarded can be migrated. There might
theoretically be some pages that can't be swapped out or discarded that
could be migrated, but why not just ignore those cases?
