Yes, it does not need backing store.

- shm fs was written as a specialized fs to implement POSIX shared
  memory based on SYSV shm.
- ramfs was introduced shortly after shm fs and was meant as a
  programming example for a minimal virtual filesystem. 
- Later shm fs was redone to use the same methods like ramfs but still
  was only useable for shared memory.
- After the release of 2.4.0, I extended shm fs to support read/write
  and thus be tmpfs and since then it can replace ramfs.
