According to the line numbers your build is pulling a version of the 
header cleaned for userspace.
Does this happen with a freshly unpacked vanilla 2.6.22 kernel from 
ftp.kernel.org?
Please send the first 50 lines of the file include/linux/dvb/audio.h in 
your kernel sources.
What is the output of "make V==1" for fs/compat_ioctl.o?
