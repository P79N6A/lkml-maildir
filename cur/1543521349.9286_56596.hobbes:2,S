You do know that the MVP3 lets you change the PCI IDs through software? It
seems some BIOS definitely do this, changing the ID of the southbridge to
an older controller ID for some unexplainable reason.
The only way to know for sure is to look on the motherboard itself. The
data from software can't be trusted.
