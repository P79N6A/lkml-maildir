The create_workqueue by default marks the worker_threads to be
non_freezable. For cpu hotplug, all workqueues can be frozen 
except the "kthread" workqueue (which is single threaded, so won't 
be frozen anyway).
And a quick cscope scan shows that only the "xfslogd" and "xfsdatad"
are the only freezable workqueues. Any particular reason
for not marking rest of the non-single_threaded workqueues freezeable ??
thanks and regards
