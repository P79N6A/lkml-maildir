We can certainly try to tune it better. 
And I do agree that we did a very drastic reduction in the dirty limits, 
and we can probably look at raising it up a bit. I definitely do not want 
to go back to the old 40% dirty model, but I could imagine 10/20% for 
async/sync (it's 5/10 now, isn't it?)
But I do not want to be guided by benchmarks per se, unless they are 
latency-sensitive. And one of the reasons for the drastic reduction was 
that there was actually a real deadlock situation with the old limits, 
although we solved that one twice - first by reducing the limits 
drastically, and then by making them be relative to the non-highmem memory 
(rather than all of it).
So in effect, we actually reduced the limits more than originally 
intended, although that particular effect should be noticeable mainly just 
on 32-bit x86.
I'm certainly open to tuning. As long as "tuning" doesn't involve 
something insane like dbench numbers.
