And even X is trying to move away from that at least partially... With
the DRI driver handling IRQs and processing command buffers... except
for cards with multiple hardware contexts, but then, we are in a case
similar to Infiniband where the HW is -designed- to have specific areas
mapped into user space, and there is still a kernel driver to arbitrate,
decide who gets what, establish those mappings, etc...
Thus X isn't even a good example :-)
