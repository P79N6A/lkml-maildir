The idea I had was to catch processes which are preforming ostensibly
undesireable filesystem operations (as defined by the actions that F_NOTIFY can
monitor).  I'm not sure how else to avoid the race condition that can arise
between the delivery of the F_NOTIFY signal to the monitoring process, and the
exiting of the monitored process. If you have another thought, I'm certainly
open to it.
Re: restarting processes.  If a sysadmin wants to manually resart stopped
processes, that would certainly be an option.  My thought was that the
monitoring process could do it in code.  notice this patch also delivers the pid
of the stopped process in si_pid to the process receiving the signal.
Regards
Neil
