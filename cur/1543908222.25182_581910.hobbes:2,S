how did you disable the jiffies logic? Also, could you please send me 
the cfs-debug-info.sh:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
captured _while_ the above workload is running. This is the third time 
i've asked for that :-)
to establish that the basic sched_clock() behavior is sound on that box, 
could you please also run this tool:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/tsc-dump.c
please run it both while the system is idle, and while there's a CPU hog 
running:
  while :; do :; done &
and send me that output too? (it's 2x 60 lines only) Thanks!
	Ingo
