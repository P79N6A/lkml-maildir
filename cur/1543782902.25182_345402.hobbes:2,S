2.6.13 does not boot in my PPC (iBook, 500 MHz), it hangs just at the very 
begining and the machines is automatically rebooted after a couple of 
minutes.
The on-screen messages finishes with a few "openpic" messages:

I used the same 2.5.12's .config that works fine 
(
http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/tmp/config-2.6.13-ppc.txt
). During "make oldconfig" 
I selected the default options, with the exception of the "hardware monitor" 
which I first enabled and then disabled because was the first suspicious.
Can I do any further test? Or is it a stupid mistake?
Cheers.
