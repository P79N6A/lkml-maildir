Which bit are you streaming, what kind of things are you doing with the
data ?
Take a database table are you - accessing it sequentially with caching,
accessing it randomly without readahead or streaming it and discarding
data. All three are valid answers, for the same data, and potentially on
a per table basis in the same file.
See the fadvise proposal. O_STREAMING is basically a subset of what is
needed
