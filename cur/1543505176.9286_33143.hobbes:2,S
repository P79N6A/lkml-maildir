And as I described it's the wrong answer to this problem, instead
kmem_cache_create needs to be made more intelligent.  Adding a new
interface for cache destruction requires changes to all users of SLAB,
making SLAB creation more intelligent does not.
This is why your patch was not applied.
I find it amusing how you even quote my email where I describe how it
should be fixed, and then complain about your approach not being
looked at.
