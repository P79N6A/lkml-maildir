Hi Alan
Sorry to bug you but could you tell us what's up with the synchronisation
between your tree and Linus' please? I haven't seen any ac stuff being
spooled into Linus' tree for a while and the trees seem to be drifting
further apart ... it would be nice if there wasn't much difference
other than the device name and the page cache VFS stuff. I know you're
both hectically busy but it would be nice to know that the plan is not
to let things drift too far apart.
It's getting tricky to decide which tree to dabble with!
Thank you!
