Yes, that matches my recollection.  some versions of gcc 4.1.0 (and
possibly 4.1.1, it wouldn't be hard to check) could not handle having a
regular and weak function in the same file (I hit this trying to do
some abstraction or another in kgdb, using includes) but it was correct
if in separate files.  I assume blacklisting 4.1.0 is out of the
question :)
