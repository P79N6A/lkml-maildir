I believe the interface is OK in that regard.  AFAIK, Oracle is happy
with it.

I'm a bit concerned about this, too.  My preference would have been to
use the regular mmap() and shmat() syscalls with some
augmentation/hint as to what the preferred page size is (Simon
Winwood's OLS 2002 paper talks about some options here).  I like this
because hints could be useful even with a transparent superpage
scheme.
The original Intel patch did use more of a hint-like approach (the
hint was a simple binary flag though: give me regular pages or give me
large pages), but Linus preferred a separate syscall interface, so the
Intel folks switched over to doing that.
