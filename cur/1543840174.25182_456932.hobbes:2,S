Thanks, you're right, I missed that.  I'll change this to byte access 
shortly.  Any recommendations for style/api for byte access? 
I could create a searate patch to change struct descr {} to split 
the u32 into several u8's; there's a dozen spots that get touched.
Alternatel, I could do a cheesy cast to char[4] and access that way.
Opinions?
