The reason I did not send it directly, but sent it to Andre for proper 
fix, is that the error is all over the place, this is from ide-cd.c
static void ide_cdrom_add_settings(ide_drive_t *drive)
{
	int major = HWIF(drive)->major;
	int minor = drive->select.b.unit << PARTN_BITS;
	ide_add_setting(drive,	"breada_readahead",	SETTING_RW, BLKRAGET, BLKRASET, 
TYPE_INT, 0, 255, 1, 2, &read_ahead[major], NULL);
	ide_add_setting(drive,	"file_readahead",	SETTING_RW, BLKFRAGET, BLKFRASET, 
TYPE_INTA, 0, INT_MAX, 1, 1024, &max_readahead[major][minor],	NULL);
	ide_add_setting(drive,	"max_kb_per_request",	SETTING_RW, BLKSECTGET, 
BLKSECTSET, TYPE_INTA, 1, 255, 1, 2, &max_sectors[major][minor], NULL);
	ide_add_setting(drive,	"dsc_overlap",		SETTING_RW, -1, -1, TYPE_BYTE, 0, 1, 
1,	1, &drive->dsc_overlap, NULL);
}
