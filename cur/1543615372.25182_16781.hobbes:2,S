And since here in the real world, where the set of all people not
including you lives, seek time dominates storage performance thus 15000RPM
disks are going to chew up and spit out 7200RPM disks.
It is very silly to compare a hardware RAID 0+1 to a software RAID 0,
since RAID 0+1 has to push twice as many bytes as RAID 0 to acheive the
same effect, and your software RAID 0 has a much more powerful CPU than
the i960 on your Mylex RAID controller.
