This would involve the pci hotplug driver.  On 2.6, look in
/sys/bus/pci/slots for the different pci slots (after you have loaded
the proper pci hotplug driver for your hardware.)  To add or remove a
card, simply echo 0 or 1 in the power file in the slot that you wish to
turn on or off.  I recommend using the pcihpview program if you don't
like using echo, as it is a gui driven program to do the same thing.
The FC-HBA portion is the same if it's hotplugged or not, no difference
there.

It should just be added, if the whole FC-HBA comes up.  If you mean
adding another one later on, after the controller card has scanned the
bus, I don't know, ask the scsi people.
Hope this helps.
