Let's say there is a piece of (crap) controller which can handle 4 
segments; but the system has a powerful IOMMU which can merge pretty 
well.  The driver wants to handle large requests for performance but it 
doesn't want to break up requests itself (pretty pointless, block layer 
merges, driver breaks down).  A request should be large but not larger 
than what the hardware can take at once.
So, it uses max_phys_segments to tell block layer how many sg entries 
the driver is willing to handle (some arbitrary large number) and 
reports 4 for max_hw_segments letting block layer know that requests 
should not be more than 4 segments after DMA-mapping.
To sum up, block layer performs request sizing in favor of block 
drivers, so it needs to know the size limits.
Is this explanation any better than my previous one?  :-P
Also, theoretically there can be more than one IOMMUs on a system (is 
there already?).  Block layer isn't yet ready to handle such cases but 
when it becomes necessary, all that needed is to make currently global 
IOMMU merging parameters request queue specific and modify drivers such 
that they tell block layer their IOMMU parameters.
