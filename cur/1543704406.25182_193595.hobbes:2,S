I was hoping this might fix the "missing TLB flush" which Martin
Schwidefsky believes is there, and which is causing him grief.

But look:
 	retval = 0;
 	build_mmap_rb(mm);
 out:
 	flush_tlb_mm(current->mm);
 	up_write(&oldmm->mmap_sem);
 	return retval;
 fail_nomem:
 	retval = -ENOMEM;
 fail:
+	flush_tlb_mm(current->mm);
 	vm_unacct_memory(charge);
 	goto out;
 }
There is no missing flush here.
