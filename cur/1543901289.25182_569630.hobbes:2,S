Ok. In fact, it would have been nice if gcc had been able to pick it up
for another reason. The old code is:
	if (cascade == NULL)
		return;
	cascade_irq = irq_of_parse_and_map(cascade, 0);
	if (cascade == NO_IRQ) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "mpic: failed to map cascade interrupt");
		return;
	}
And NO_IRQ is 0 on powerpc nowadays. Thus the test can never be true :-)
But it looks like gcc doesn't pick that up.
Ben.
