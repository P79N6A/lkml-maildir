So, we know now it's almost definitely something about lapic and IPIs
but, maybe it's not this code to blame...
Here is one more patch to check the possibility it's about the way
the resend edge type irqs are handled by level type handlers:
so, let's check if acking isn't too late...
Marcin and Jean-Baptiste: I would be very glad, as usual! And no need
to hurry; I think we know enough to fix this for you, but maybe this
test could explain if there are errors in lapics or only bad handling.
Many thanks,
Jarek P. 
PS: this patch is very experimental, and only intended for testing.
It should be applied to clean 2.6.23-rc1 or a bit older (eg. 2.6.22)
(so 2.6.23-rc2 or any patches from this thread shouldn't be around)
