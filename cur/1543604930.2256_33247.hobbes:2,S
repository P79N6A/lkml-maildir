Hi everyone.
I'm interested in developing a file system which could take features from
ramfs and cramfs so I have a couple of questions which possibly Linus
would answer to.
First, what is the current status of these modules ? Are new features
currently being developed ?
Second, quoting from the jffs2's TODO list :
- fix zlib. It's ugly as hell and there are at least three copies in the
kernel tree
What is the current status of zlib ?
Third, is there any project which tries to implement bzip2 algorithm
inside the kernel ? Does it give better compression ratios on 1-page-long
data ?
Thanks :-)
Cristiano
