If you need at least one user-level program in an embedded device (like
the "minimal userspace webserver that does CGI" above), you pull in some
libc functions. But then you already have the libc functions, and the
additional code for serving static web pages is trivial and doesn't add to
the size noticeably.
Putting stuff inside the kernel is not the solution in that case. Using a
lightweight c library is.
Granted, if the sole application of the embedded box is to serve some
static webpages, and you don't need any other programs _at all_, then you
can add the 150 lines of code in the kernel it takes to serve webpages
(in a simple, not heavyweight-optimised manner). But then we're talking
about a pretty specialised scenario.
