Yes, and one of the consequences is that people who disagree with his
stance tell him off for it.  Him, and everyone else who profits from
distributing GPL licensed code without abiding by the very simple
requirements of the GPL are parasites.  They should stop.  Legally
they might not be required to.. and some of the best legal minds in
the world think they are, if only the copyright holders would sue
already.. but that's just a side issue.
