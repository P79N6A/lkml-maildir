IIRC, The kernel does some encryption functions, involving TCP, NFS, and 
IPsec since all these are part of the kernel itself.
If you intend to write your own apps that have to use encryption functions, 
it would be best to use the relevant encryption libraries, such as OpenSSL.
Thank you very much.
