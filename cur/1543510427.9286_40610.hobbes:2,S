There are only three chipsets that have ATA-66 native to the kernel with
two others as a WIP.  This does not include anything that Intel has
produced to date.  PIIX4 is ATA-33 limited.
If this is an ATA-66 drive, either clobber it with the OEM disable tool
or use one of my patches and include "piix_tuning" at compile time.
