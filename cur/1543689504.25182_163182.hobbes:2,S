Where does this put me? I'm finishing off 1.1 for 2.4 and have a port to
2.6 in process. I want to get it merged, but how do I go about that now?
For the record, it's worth merging, I believe. It has a fully year of
extensive testing, support for saving a full (as opposed to minimal)
image of RAM, support for highmem, swap files, full asynchronous I/O,
aborting cleanly from errors, user tuning and a nice interface. I don't
want to see it thrown away, but neither do I want to have a third
option!
Regards,
Nigel
