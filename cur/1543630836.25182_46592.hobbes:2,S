Yep. Our includes dependancies suck bigtime.  Some work has been
done already in untangling the mess, but a lot more needs to be
done to really make a real difference.
Whats scary is that if you look at the dependancy graphs[1] of the
'best of the worst' includes, it's the same ugly mess we've
come to know and expect, and yet this is *after* some cleanups
already happened.
The 'dump everything into sched.h and friends' things really
needs splitting up some more, but it's a lot of work, and I don't
think kbuild2.5 alone is going to make that much difference
in this regard. Pulling out the component parts of the bigger
includes is probably the only way around this.
A driver that needs 'jiffies' defined should not be
inadvertantly pulling in a hundred include files.
    Dave.
