So you place your money into the bank until you have a "large enough sum
to be worth investing in a mutual fund or stock", I presume. If not then you
SHOULD understand the invest now for returns later ideas. If the time is
invested now the return on investment later will be far greater than if they
finally grudgingly try to do it later.
While I was at Magnavox I watched several software projects from
proposal through production code. The more time that was invested
up front in tools the more likely the project was to be on time and on
budget or even under budget. (And this was with that roundly dispised
thing called Ada. Go figure.)
I rather strongly think it is well past time to make the debugger
investment. But building a good one is hard to do. Where is someone
smart enough and capable enough to get the core built so that there
is a rational debugger project to parallel the kernel development?
It's not a glamorous job. But somebody ought to grit their teeth and
get their name on The Linux Kernel Debugger. I suspect the community
would remember THAT person a LONG time. I kinda wish I had the
time and that it better fit my skill sets. I know the people who fit the
project are out there earning REALLY big bucks from Raytheon
and Rockwell as well as some of the more often thought of companies.

Dr. Horst H. von Brand, I think you are pointing out one of the more
splendidly large worms in the Open Source apple. Better tools are
needed and if they exist they would be used. But nobody wants the
job. So it doesn't get done.
Alas, *I* do not have a solution other than maybe to embarrass someone
into doing what has to be done and geting intense satisfaction about that
when it is done.
