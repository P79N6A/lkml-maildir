uh ??
no sorry, you are not seeing the characters I'm trying to type...
my charset is setted (on system-wide basis) to it_IT@EURO, no UTF-8 ... btw, 
tryng to use UTF-8, iso-15, iso-1 and so on does not affect the problem.
The characters I'm tring to print are the "italian single letter" that on a us 
keyboard I would type as " a` ", " e` ", " e' ", " i` ", "o` ", " u` " ...
I repeat that the strange thing is that _only_ tty1 as this strange 
beahviour .. not dipending on the user logged in (infact I have this problem 
already at login time, when I have to type the login name... If I'd have a 
login name containing one of this characters I could not login from tty1)...
Is tty1 somehow special in respect to other ttys ???
