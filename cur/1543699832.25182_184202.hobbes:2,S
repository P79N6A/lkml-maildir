I've got / on linux-raid0 on 2.6.0-t11-cset-20031209_2107:

Disks are two ST3120026AS connected to sii3112a controller, driven by sata_sil 
'patched' so no limit for block size is applied (it's not needed for it). 
Those are results of hdparm -tT on drives:
<cite>
/dev/md/1:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.40 seconds =323.28 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.75 seconds = 36.47 MB/sec
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.41 seconds =309.23 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.46 seconds = 43.87 MB/sec
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.41 seconds =315.32 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.23 seconds = 52.04 MB/sec
</cite>
What seems strange to me is that second drive is faster than first one 
(devices are symmetrical, sd[a,b]2 is swapspace (not mounted at time of 
test), sd[a,b]1 is /boot (raid1)).
What is even stranger is that raid0 which should be faster than single drive, 
is pretty much slower- what's the reason of that?
