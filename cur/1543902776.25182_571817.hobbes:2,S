Ever since I started using linux in 1997, the first program to run from an
installed system was /sbin/init. (I might think about removing the other 
paths.)
The ramfs' /init was intended for system setup, which is a separate job.
It is not intended to be the program running the system. Mixing those two
up just does not feel right. Setting root= in order to change the root
directory is much more natural.

That's no reason for keeping bugs in that part.

Using that argument, you can deduce that nobody would need selinux at all.
Obviously some people disagree, and maybe some of them are no fools,
therefore we should try to DTRT for them and do the callback when it's
supposed to happen.
BTW: The problems start as soon as you have to do "reflections on trusting 
trust".

Why should I have to do that if I can do the right thing in the first

Obviously these problems were solved.

You may also use the same kernel with the same initramfs in order to start
a classic system, just by changing root=. This may be nice for rescue
systems. Off cause after applying the third patch, you may also unselect
that feature.

These patches changes the spec in order to support system-on-rootfs:
If there is an init, it will run. No change from the current situation 
ever, at least if not using rdev.
If you use root=rootfs, a system-on-rootfs will run.
If you use rootfs=tmpfs, root= will default to rootfs, and I did it in a 
way disabeling that obsolete rdev.

Not booting /using/ an intramfs differs from not booting /from/ an 
intramfs. Mixing them works by accident.

Why do you build a way if walking through the fields already works?
Besides that, using all these features safes about 3KB.
