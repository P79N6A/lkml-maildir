These machines remain very stable at 2.4.20.
I don't know where things currently stand vis-a-vis knowing what's
causing this network/system load creep problem, but I thought I'd report
that I installed 2.4.21 on a single processor about a week ago (1GHz PIII,
500MB, Intel 82820 (ICH2) Chipset w/ eepro100 module), and am seeing the
same bad behaviour.  I have very clear graphs, if that's useful, but
haven't been logging system stats as aggressively as on some other
machines.
So something between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21, I think.  I wish I could be more
helpfull..
