I already queued a patch for x86-64 for this for post 2.6.14
following earlier complaints from Eric.
iirc on 32bit there are other issues though like limited
number of reader lock users.
But then I'm not sure why anybody would want to run a 32bit
kernel on such a big machine ...

Someone at Unisys just needs to put dual core hyper threaded CPUs
into their 64 socket systems, then you'll have a 256 CPU x86 machine
(which is currently the maximum the APICs can take anyways...) 
With Multicores being on everybody's roadmap we'll probably see 
such big systems soon.
