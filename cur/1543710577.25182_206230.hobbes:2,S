what you are missing is that we don't need a prio_tree at all with
anonmm+linus-unshare-mremap, prio tree can make sense only with
anon_vma, not with anonmm. the vm_pgoff is meaningless with anonmm.
find_vma (and the rbtree) already does the trick with anonmm. the
linus-unshare-mremap guarantees that a certain physical page will be
only at a certain virtual address in every mm, so prio_tree taking pgoff
into account isn't needed there, find_vma is more than enough.
any prio_tree can't fix anyways the problem that anonmm will force
the vm to scan all mm at the page->index address, even for a newly
allocated malloc region. that is optimized away by anon_vma, plus
anon_vma avoids the early-COW in mremap. the relevant downside of
anon_vma is that it takes some more byte in the vma to provide those
features.
