There's a few _big_ things that aren't addressed in my makefile hack
either. It's very much a proof of concept.
However, if we limit the use of --combine to files within the same
directory, the modifications to the kbuild infrastructure shouldn't be
too intrusive. I strongly suspect that files within the same directory
are where the majority of the benefit is anyway.
Whole-kernel optimisation is likely to be prohibitively expensive, and
can wait for LTO¹.
