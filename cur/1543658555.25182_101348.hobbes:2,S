    Hi HPA :))
> Can we *please* kill off the stupid in-kernel boot sector?
    Yespleaseyespleaseyesplease... I posted a message here a long
time ago because I couldn't boot a raw kernel image with 2.4.x. Well,
it didn't work even with a emulated floppy image (El Torito, you
know)...
    I think that, with those good boot loaders out there, this piece
of code, that is architecture dependend, should be off-the kernel.
    IMHO, those saved bytes should be used to store another cool Tux
image or something like that XDDDDD

    Exact...
    You've got a very good and sensible idea ;)
