I just diffed out the boot log between 2.4.27 and 2.4.28.  And I found
this new message appearing in 2.4.28:
        ACPI: IRQ9 SCI: Edge set to Level Trigger.
Weird since IRQ 9 is not in use in this system.  IRQ9 is typically
used by ACPI.
After some digging in the sources, I found that the newly introduced
(2.4.28-rc2) function acpi_early_init() runs wether or not acpi=off
was specified on the command line.
This trivial patch makes my laptop suspend-happy.  Len, please confirm
that this is ok.  Marcelo, please include in 29-pre.
Phil.
