Yes, it does, but you have to be root to do this (ie overkill).  However, it 
turns out that the "first" mount works if you specify both codepage and 
iocharset at the same time even if they do not fit each to other (eg cp437 
and iso8859-2).  It looks like a bug to me.
Thanks,

PS
BTW, I think the mount should be reported as "ro" if it's not _really_ "rw".
