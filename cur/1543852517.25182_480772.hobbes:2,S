Subject: [Dumb question] 100k RTC interrupts/sec on SMP system: why?

Hi.
I have a couple of old SMP systems (Dual P3 on Intel STL2 boards), on
which I experience the following:
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- -----cpu------
 0  0      0 800752  45376 143064    0    0     0     8 96607   65  0 0 100  0  0
 0  0      0 800752  45376 143064    0    0     0     0 96439   57  0 0 100  0  0
It's a completely idle system. Interrupts are coming from rtc.
This is a stock fedora SMP kernel.
IIRC, some time ago (years) I've read that rtc can be used somehow in
SMP but I don't remember the specifics. So, maybe you are familiar
with this and can give out a quick answer - what this 100K
interrupts/sec are about, and how to get rid of them (if possible).
Thanks!
