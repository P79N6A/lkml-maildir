Note that the Theses and Aries are Xeon systems, which are 32-bit systems
in the first place, so the problem described is likely not applicable
to these.  I fully expect that the problem being encountered on Baby Alcor
(and Bonnie?) is specifically because of the large memory configuration,
on a 64-bit system, but running a 32-bit OS configuration.  At least
that's how I understood the explanation.
