btw., the softlockup watchdog detects non-progressing uninterruptible 
tasks (regardless of whether they locked up due to mutexes or any other 
reason).
This does occasionally help in debugging deadlocks:

but it would indeed be also good to have the most common self-deadlock 
case checked unconditionally in the mutex slowpath.
