Hi everbody,
  Will kernel tree 2.0 stop developing and regard historical after the release 
of 2.6?  I think we would put our focus on much more newer kernel. And I found 
this may confuse the newbies, because they don't know much about versioning in 
Kernel.
  In nowsdays, there are less less compputers using 2.0. We should push them to 
upgrade, so I think stop developing 2.0 is better, in my opinion
