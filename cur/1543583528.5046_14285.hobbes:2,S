hi
One of my friend needs some information on third party products on LINUX
1)Are there any RDBMS available on linux
2)IF they are present ,then how powerful are they (relatively)
3)Are there any Databases which come along with the LINUX open source.
I will be thankful for ur kind feedback on these questions.
With regards,
Girish.S.
