Optimization versus debugging is a common issue...
As I said, it might make sense to disable this optimization depending on 
some debugging option.

This would lead to people trying to optimize code for one gcc version - 
and the code might stay this way for 10 years.
People should write readable C code. This also has the best chances of 
resulting in good performance with the next gcc version on the next 
generation hardware.
