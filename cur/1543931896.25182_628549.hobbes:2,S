More news, I hope this time my problem get more attention from developers 
since now I have much more information.
So far I found that:
  - 2.6.20-rc4 - bad: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=14057
  - 2.6.20-rc2 - bad: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=14058
  - 2.6.20-rc1 - OK (probably, I need to wait little more to be 100% sure).
2.6.20-rc1 with 33m uptime:
~$ grep Dirt /proc/meminfo ;sync ; sleep 1 ; sync ; grep Dirt /proc/meminfo
Dirty:           10504 kB
Dirty:               0 kB
2.6.20-rc2 was released Dec 23/24 2006 (BAD)
2.6.20-rc1 was released Dec 13/14 2006 (GOOD?)
It seems that this bug was introduced exactly one year ago. Surprisingly, 
dirty memory in 2.6.20-rc2/2.6.20-rc4 leaks _much_ more faster than in 
2.6.20-final and later kernels as it took only about 6h to reach 172MB. 
So, this bug might be cured afterward, but only a little.
There are three commits that may be somehow related:

I'm going to check 2.6.20-rc1-git... releases but it would be *very* nice 
if someone could finally give ma a hand and point some hints helping 
debugging this problem.
Please note that none of my systems with kernels >= 2.6.20-rc1 is able to 
reach 0 kb of dirty memory, even after many synces, even when idle.
