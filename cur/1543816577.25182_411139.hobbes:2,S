I think that the patch I sent to address a) above will also fix this 
problem as find_busiest_queue() will no longer find node-0 as the 
busiest group unless both of the processes in node-0 are on the same 
CPU.  This is because it now only considers groups that have at least 
one CPU with more than one running task as candidates for being the 
busiest group.
Implicit in this is the assumption that it's OK to move one of the tasks 
from node-0 to node-1 if they're both on the same CPU within node-0.
Could you confirm this is OK?
Thanks,
Peter
