I only have anecdotal evidence, but 2.4.12 worked fine for my on a single
SCSI disk but as soon as I mounted my root device on RAID 0, the kernel
would oops  (after ~30 seconds up uptime) and all processes which write to
the disk would be unkillable.
I switched to 2.4.12-ac3 with no problems (yet).
