I don\'t like the vmalloc():
* vmalloc must flush all TLB\'s on alls CPU\'s, ie it\'s
extremely slow.
* it\'s superflous: there are no atomicity guarantees for
/dev/kmem, what about allocating a single page, and
adding a short loop:
while(len > 0) {
	int cur_len = len;
	if(cur_len > PAGE_SIZE)
		cur_len = PAGE_SIZE;
	...
	len -= cur_len;
}

access is not

I never benchmarked it myself, but Christoph benchmarked
the shm code: vmalloc() was so slow that he replaced it
with an indirect allocation.
A driver that frequently calls ioremap() will be slow -
with or without lock_kernel().
