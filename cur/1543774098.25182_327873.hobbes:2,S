I would prefer to keep devfs around as well, but most of my embedded 
systems have enough RAM to put a primitive /dev tree in tmpfs using a 
linuxrc script at boot.  The workarounds for the userland requirements 
of udev are a little less clear to me, but I'm not sure they're 
insurmountable yet for anything except the smallest embedded systems, 
since Busybox appears to have some udev support available now.
I think that devfs and udev appeal to different audiences, hence I don't 
think you can say that the "world will be a better place" with one or 
the other.  It would be nice to find a way to have the two coexist 
peacefully...
Case in point.  I'm going to udev reluctantly; all my embedded work 
based on earlier kernels used devfs exclusively.
