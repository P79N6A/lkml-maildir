no state for no connection.
if you want rate limiting, you can use iptables -m limit, or whatever your fw 
implements. Frankly, you can't distinguish DNS traffic from someone who 
hijacked your box by just looking at the packet's header. And your FW _has_ to 
account for the case that multiple, possibly "non-related" packets appear on 
the same source port.

And the kernel keeps a rover. It's right here:
	grep udp_port_rover /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/*.c
So whenever someone binds an udp socket to port 0, the kernel chooses 
something. And IF NOT (i.e port != 0 at the time you call bind), you gonna use 
THAT specific port.
