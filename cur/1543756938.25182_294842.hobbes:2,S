Add a cancellation period or a relicense block to BK/Free.
For instance:
1. $licensee can cancel his license with 30 days period before end of a
   month
2. BK/Free license is not available to (1) people who have worked on a
   system essentially similar to BK in the past six weeks, (2) people
   who have had their BK/Free license terminated within the past six
   weeks for any reason other than a new BK version becoming available.

This is, by your leave, ridiculous. I was, so far, allowed to stop using
BK/Free on day #1 and hack non-BK SCM on day #2. I understand you don't
want users to repeat this sequence, use BK on every odd day of month and
hack non-BK SCM on every even day, and I haven't done that (I haven't
hacked SCM).

So have them send a SSAE and pass that note in writing.
