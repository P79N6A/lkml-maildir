Yes, this semantics is same for AMD and Intel. And we have verified that
it also works AMD.

Yes, The "common" word is for the common set of bit-mask between all the
SMP processors, in case they are not same. Renaming the
mxcsr_common_mask to mxcsr_feature_mask is ok.

I agree that it will be cleaner to read. The idea of the set_fpu_mxcsr()
was to export access to the static mxcsr_common_mask variable. We can
get rid of the function by making the mask a global variable, or through
a new function exporting the static variable.
