Hello Mikulas,
	I think I have an hpfs patch for you.
	linux-2.3.31/fs/hpfs/file.c attempts to call grab_page_cache,
which is not defined anywhere in the kernel.  However, there is a
routine named grab_cache_page that matches the parameters being
passed.  I believe the call to grab_page_cache was supposed to
grab_cache_page, but I am not completely sure and I do not have
an hpfs partition on which I could test the resulting code, so I
leave it to you to email it directly to Linus if you think my patch
is correct.
