No. As I said, I mount /dev with mount -t devfs devfs /dev in a sysinit 
bootscript. Whether it's in the kernel or not shouldn't make any difference. 
Maybe I just need to reissue LILO after booting the 32bit dev_t kernel?

I'll try that, thanks. But I have this in lilo.conf:
boot=/dev/discs/disc0/disc
root=/dev/discs/disc0/part2
/dev/discs is indeed a symlink, but it should be resolved when LILO is 
installed, i.e., prior to the reboot. Why has this behaviour changed?
Cheers,
Alistair.
