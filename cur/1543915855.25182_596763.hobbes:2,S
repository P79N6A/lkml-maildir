Hi,
sorry for this taking too long, I was physically located away from the 
hardware. 
Without your patch, after resume I got corrupted image (looked like 
remains of BIOS POST graphics, in bad resolution, or something like that).
With your patch applied, I get no video at all after resume (I tried all 
three possible combinations of acpi_sleep parameter).
