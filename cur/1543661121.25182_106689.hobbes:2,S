Subject: [Announce]  Smatch checker / bug database
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I have been working on an error checker called Smatch that was 
inspired by the Stanford Checker.  The project page is at
http://smatch.sf.net
Smatch is useable but still in pre-Alpha stage.  Email me or 
smatch-dicuss@lists.sf.net if you have any problems.  So far, 
I've been really good at replying promptly.
On the smatch.sf.net page there is a link to the database of 
bugs Smatch scripts have found.  A lot of the bugs turn out 
to be false positives so the web page has a feature where you 
can create a login and mark a bug as a false positive. 
Hopefully you will find Smatch useful.
Thanks,
Dan Carpenter
