	Like you, I also disagree with this approach, but I think it
is ugly enough and has so little justification that I see, that I
_currently_ hope that those comments from the Makefile will simply
be deleted.
	If radical changes were necessary, the drm maintainers could
always write libdrm2 and modules that needed that would pick it up via
depmod/modprobe.  We have radical changes all the time in kernel
interfaces (for example, the "new style" PCI initilialization) and deal
with the same issues of wanting to support old methods for old hardware
for a while.  Imagine if the rest of the kernel took this approach.
	The issue of supporting old hardware is particularly inapplicable
to drm, because drm, given that the shortcut to the framebuffer that is drm
is for situations where one is willing to go some trouble to get really
fast graphics performance.  Users of those applications will be
disproprortionately likely to keep up with hardware.  This is like
recoding i386 floating point into assembly language: the
performance vs. maintenance trade off is not worth it because 386's
have migrated to tasks where that performance is not valued at all
(otherwise they'd be upgraded to 486's at least).  And, yes, I am
saying that the approach of replicating the .o files is *harder*
to maintain, because it is an unusual build scheme and increases the
resource cost of enabling drm, encouraging small (such as boot-over-network)
systems to drop it.
	Also, from looking in the list of external symbols that the
drm modules resolve, it is also clear to me that replicating these
object files will not result in binary modules that work with many
kernel versions, if that is what they were aiming for.
	Anyhow, it is not my call, and there probably aren't any
more keystrokes for me to generate with respect to this issue, but
if there is not some information that I have missed about this issue,
then I sure hope that the drm maintainers will see the light or, if not,
that Linus overrules the drm maintainers if necessary and integrates a
patch like the one I posted and just deletes those comments from
drivers/char/drm/Makefile.
