hm, Thomas pointed it out that this wont solve all the problems as 
quicklists have a built-in "preserve me" throttle (which is rather 
stupid).
the right solution is to get rid of quicklists altogether (Thomas 
expects to have patches for that later today).
If anyone implements a _sane_ general purpose allocator that can 
preserve constructed objects then i'm all for utilizing it in x86 too, 
but quicklists arent that mechanism ...
