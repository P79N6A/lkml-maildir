Hi,
I've been wondering if it would make sense to auto enable CONFIG_RTC when 
CONFIG_SMP is set?
I'm judging entirely from this bit of text from the CONFIG_RTC help text : 
[...]
If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
"Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.
[...]
Isn't it always desirable to be able to set the clock in an SMP compatible 
fashion if the kernel is indeed build for SMP?
If it would make sense to make such a change I'll be happy to supply a 
patch.
