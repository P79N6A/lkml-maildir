I just wish that people would learn from the mistakes of others.  The 
MacOS is a prime example of why you do not want to use a forked 
filesystem, yet some people still seem to think it is a good idea. 
(Forked filesystems tend to be fragile and do not play well with 
non-forked filesystems.)

I would like to see more clarification from the designers as to what 
problem they are trying to solve.  Some of the goals seem to be laudable, 
but some are not problems that I worry about.
I see filesystems that are trying to handle the flakeyness of hardware. 
That is useful to me.  I also see people who are trying to archive every 
little change for "legal reasons".  I have a hard time with this one 
because I have a hard enough time keeping spare hard drive space for the 
stuff I want, not the space that someone else wants me to keep.
What I really want are high throughput systems where I can write and read 
as fast as the hardware will allow.  (And then I want faster hardware.)
