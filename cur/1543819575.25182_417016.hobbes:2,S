In case of MultiAdm: It adds some more LSM hooks, some of which have
received a frown.[1] And it adds a ton of changes scattered throughout
the kernel (namely replacing capable() with capable_x()) -- I would
suppose these would be ignored to death even more than [1]. Just look
at the 2.6.15-mtadm.diff within the multiadm package.
In general: I am probably too strongly tied to my own CodingStyle to
change it for Documentation/CodingStyle. (Regarding tabs-vs-space. I'm
flexible about indent level.) After all, I have to maintain it... If
someone else makes the necessary adjustments, let it be.
