I completed storage layer development itself, the only remaining todo item
is to implement new redundancy algorithm, but I did not see major demand
on that, so it will stay for now with low priority.
I will use DST as a transport layer for distributed filesystem, and
probably that will require additional features, I have no clean design so
far, but right now I have nothing in the pipe to commit to DST.
