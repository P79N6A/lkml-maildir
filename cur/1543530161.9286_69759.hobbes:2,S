	Add the following to your fstab:
	none	/proc/bus/usb	usbdevfs	defaults	0 0
	Then type "mount /proc/bus/usb".
	Now "ls /proc/bus/usb" should show something like this:
	001  devices  drivers
	Usb has its own file system that it's supporting.  Putting it
in fstab will insure that it gets mounted at boot up.
