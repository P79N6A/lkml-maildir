I have no problem with your latest patch for ARM.  Moving ARM to
assembly will actually remove some information which the compiler
has when it knows about the access to be performed.
If atomic_read() were converted to inline assembly, we'd prevent the
compiler from knowing that a load has been performed and it should
therefore avoid using the result of the load where possible for the
following few instructions (due to result delays.)
