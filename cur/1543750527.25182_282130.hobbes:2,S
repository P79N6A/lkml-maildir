2.6.10-rc3 maybe... depending on whether you want to look at this oops
with a proprietary iSCSI module loaded...

However, the fact that this person can't reproduce the slab corruption
without this iSCSI module loaded may be telling, but since you're also
chasing such a problem, it may not have anything to do with their iSCSI
stuff.
