There is a possibility that another kernel may be reordering your
SCSI disks differently.
Try several roots in your /etc/lilo.conf file and see which one works.
Like this:
#
#  Lilo boot-configuration script.
#
boot = /dev/sda
message = /boot/message
compact
delay = 15	# optional, for systems that boot very quickly
vga = normal	# force sane state
image = /vmlinuz
 root = /dev/sda1
 label = linux-a
image = /vmlinuz
  root  = /dev/sdb1 
  label = linux-b
image = /vmlinuz
  root  = /dev/sdc1 
  label = linux-c
Cheers,
