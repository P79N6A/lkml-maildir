Ummm. sorry. The directory entry contains only:
              struct dirent
              {
                  long d_ino;                 /* inode number */
                  off_t d_off;                /* offset to this dirent */
                  unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this d_name */
                  char d_name [NAME_MAX+1];   /* file name (null-terminated) */
              }
Only enough to support directories. Even the kernel structure doesn't have
more (from linux/fs/readdir.c):
struct old_linux_dirent {
        unsigned long   d_ino;
        unsigned long   d_offset;
        unsigned short  d_namlen;
        char            d_name[1];
};                                                                                             
Everything else is in the inode. No "extent of the data blocks". The byte-
stream is implemented via runtime library. read/write transfers variable
length buffers.

And that bloats the VFS code, with something that will perform like a 
directory, look like a directory, and act like a directory, but not
"be a directory". (If it quacks like a duck, and ...:)

That seems reasonable, but this thread isn't about being reasonable.
