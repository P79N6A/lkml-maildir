Sill bullshit. I did nothing except to try to help a neighbor
who got locked out of her machine. I spent most of Saturday
and all of Sunday trying to break in. The LILO command prompt
readily took "parameters". However, any parameter passed on
the command-line resulted in a try-to-kill init error. Her
machine uses an Adaptec SCSI controller which needs to be
loaded via initrd to make the root file-system available.
I tried Red-Hat 8.0 here at work. It works as you described.
There is no problem with it and LILO and initrd. However
Red Hat 9/Professional does not allow break-in, at least on
the machine tested...and I have several pissed off witnesses.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
