This looks better and it makes FreeBSD able to ls the directory, and on
touch /mnt/try, I get EROFS on the client, so this is okay; however, the
access reply does not include EXECUTE permissions which I find strange,
since the client lists this:
drwxrwxrwt  23 root  wheel  706 Jan  2 11:53 /mnt
Evidently, the directory has execution permissions for everyone.
