No, that would not work at all.  We have a very nice system to allow  
set-uid scripts (Specifically, I like my nice secure taint-mode set- 
uid perl scripts).  If you did this, they would break completely, not  
to mention _add_ all sorts of unsolvable race conditions to the few  
ways of working around such a lack of SUID scripts.  Also, it means  
that I can't just "mv /sbin/init /sbin/init.real ; vim /sbin/init" to  
do a simple wrapper around the init program, I would need to write a  
compiled C program to do all sorts of fragile hackish things like  
calling a script /sbin/init.sh.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
