Because all of the RPC stuff was, initially, user-mode code. For
performance reasons or otherwise, it was moved into the kernel.
Okay, so far? Now, when something goes wrong with that code, should
that code be fixed, or should the unrelated TCP/IP code be modified
to accommodate? I think the time-outs should be put at the correct
places and not added to generic network code.
Once the client side gets a buffer of data from the TCP/IP stack,
the TCP/IP should not care (ever) what it does with it. Putting
the timeout(s) in the TCP/IP stack, makes it care, and adds code
to accommodate.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
