Yeah, that seems to be what's going on.  I don't think we have any other
choice than blacklisting those notebooks.  This is a mess.  How does the
other OS cope with this?
I'm thinking about using DMI vendor/product match to detect the affected
systems but I think it would be better to match the ACPI implementation
directly.  Is there a way to match specific ACPI implementation?
Thanks.
