We can't allocate a huge kiobuf structure just for requesting one page of
IO.  It might get better with VM-level IO clustering though.

No.  I was speaking abou the light-weight kiobuf Linux & Me discussed on
lkml some time ago (though I'd much more like to call it kiovec analogous
to BSD iovecs).
And a page,offset,length tuple is pretty cheap compared to a current kiobuf.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
