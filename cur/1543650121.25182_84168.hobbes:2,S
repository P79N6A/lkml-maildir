The kprobes homepage says:
 Extensions to kprobes
   kprobes has been developed from the full Dynamic Probes patch. It
   includes the essential mechanism to allow probes to exist in kernel
   space. The RPN Language Interpreter, Watchpoints and User-space probes
   extensions, which are part of the Dynamic Probes Package, will be
   available as add-on patches from the website.
   At the moment, we are proposing for kprobes inclusion into the kernel
   which includes the following four patches:
     * kprobes base:
       Provides the interface described above
     * debug register management:
        [snip]
     * kwatch points:
        [snip]
     * user space probes:
The first paragraph seems to say that only the base patch is being
submitted and the watchpoint and user-space extensions can be
retrieved from the site.
But then it goes on to say that you are proposing those for inclusion
also.  I'm confused and I've been using your patches.  Also, that first
paragraph mentions "add-on" patches while all along I thought your
intention was to have enough of dprobes in the kernel so that patching
wasn't necessary.
