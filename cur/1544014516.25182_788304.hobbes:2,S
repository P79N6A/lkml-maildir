Ok, this one looks _almost_ ok.
The only problem is that I think you've lost the UP case. 
In UP, you shouldn't have the code to spin, and the "spin_or_schedule()" 
should fall back to just the schedule case.
It migth also be worthwhile to try to not set the owner, and re-organize 
that a bit (by making it a inline function that sets the owner only for 
CONFIG_SMP or lockdep/debug).
