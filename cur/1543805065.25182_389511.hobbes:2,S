I disagree. Look at the graph. mm results are consistent and stable, and 
significantly worse than mainline.

Thanks, but I have that. What do you think those vertical bars on the 
graph are for? ;-) They're deviation of 5 runs. I throw away the best 
and worst first. If it was just random noise, then you'd get the same 
variance *between* runs inside the -mm train and inside mainline. You 
don't see that ...
Use the visuals in the graph .. it's very telling. -mm is *broken*.
It may well not be the same issue as last time though, I shouldn't
have jumped to that conclusion.
