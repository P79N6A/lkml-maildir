Hi Dave: (hope i'm addressing this issue to the right person!)
When making bzImage with the current BK I receive the following during 
the final link process:
net/built-in.o(.text+0x4ba22): In function `xfrm_probe_algs':
: undefined reference to `crypto_alg_available'
net/built-in.o(.text+0x4ba68): In function `xfrm_probe_algs':
: undefined reference to `crypto_alg_available'
this is because ipv4 seems to depend on some Cryptographic API stuff... 
that doesn't sound right though! Anyway, I added base Cryptographic API
support to shut it up, and the link went fine.
But this was definitely not added until recently - I was able to  
compile all 2.5.54 BK cleanly. What's the deal now?
Regards
Josh
