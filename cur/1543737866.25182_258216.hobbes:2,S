Interesting point.  Any readers (init, some/all of it's children) will
read until one reaches EOF, all writers will flood it 'til it's full.
If there was an IOUAC (international obfuscated unix abuse contest),
you could use this for IPC, maybe.

Anyone able to turn /dev/console into a regular file can already do
much worse things.  Don't think it's a security issue.
