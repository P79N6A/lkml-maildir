OK.  That raises an interesting question.  If a) you as the IDE
maintainer want to make a policy change, and b) you have a concrete
action to take, then how do you go about it so that the right thing
(tm) happens?
One tack would be to post to the ARM list stating that there is
such-and-such, a new policy, and this requires a change to the
way-things-work (tm).  Then effect a patch that breaks the bad stuff
so that the users of such bad stuff must cope.
For example, the patch could edit each of the arm ide files so that
they don't compile when IDE is enabled.  This wouldn't clobber the
files as much as make them useless until the such-and-such policy is
followed.

Ah.  I see where you're going.  I can do that.  I cannot test it, but
I can do it.
BTW, thanks for you help and input.
Cheers.
