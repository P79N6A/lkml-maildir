It isnt for interrupt stuff - its going back to the old kernel behaviour
when it used to be usable

Actually the code it uses is clean, slightly verbose but clean. It puts
the phases in the right order and that fixes the race cleanly. You
could just use completions in that case or you could use
	wait_event_interruptible(&my_wait_queue, my_condition==FALSE)
which is a macro that generates the right stuff.
