I was wrong. After several trials the same behavior also occurs on the
Core2 Duo T7200. It just took longer to show its nasty.

False. It used to run fine, until the creeps happen first time :(

Now it applies to all 2.6.23-rt1 images I could test upon.

Not be sure anymore, but this seems to be still a valid assumption.
Just in case someone might try in reproducing this showstopper, the
kernel .config is available from here:
  
http://www.rncbc.org/datahub/config-2.6.23-rt1.0
dmesg output as right after init:
  
http://www.rncbc.org/datahub/dmesg-2.6.23-rt1.0
which can't really tell where to look :)
Cheers.
