Though there is nothing wrong with this patch, I would prefer a single 
function, pci_intx(), as found in drivers/scsi/ahci.c.
Would you be willing to move that one to the PCI layer, eliminate the 
multiple copies of pci_enable_intx(), and replace the calls to 
pci_enable_intx() with calls to pci_intx() ?
