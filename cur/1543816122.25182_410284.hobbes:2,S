OK, we have an andi-easter-egg:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16/2.6.16-mm1/broken-out/x86_64-mm-lost-cli-debug.patch.
So you're right, it's not the time patches.  I just blame you whenever anything
time-related goes wrong - who else is there? ;)
The above patch records the most-recent caller of local_irq_disable() in a
global variable, then prints that out in the lost-ticks handler.  But how
do we know that the global didn't get overwritten between the most-recent
local_irq_enable() and the call to handle_lost_ticks()?
I guess the code assumes that the local_irq_enable() will result in
insta-entry into the timer IRQ handler.  Which is probably good enough, as
interrupts from other sources won't be pending most times.
So why did we lose three ticks after __do_sortirq()'s local_irq_disable()? 
Dunno.
I think a better debugging patch would be:
u64 timestamp[NR_CPUS];
local_irq_disable()
{
	cli;
	timestamp[me] = rdtslcc();
}
local_irq_enable()
{
	if (rdtscll() - timestamp[me] > enough)
		whine();
	sti;
}
(Is there any point in do_softirq() doing local_irq_save() instead of
local_irq_disable()?  __do_softirq() will unconditionally enable anyway..)
