 If RAM is clobbered you cannot assure the check will fail for bogus data.
Then the code executed afterwards may trash data on a hard disk.

 This does not work.  Asserting RESET causes one of the bits in the
keyboard controller to remember the fact and all PC BIOSes check for a
cold start at the very beginning of the execution and ignore the reset
code in this case.  Also memory refresh subsystem may not work after
asserting RESET.  What PCs are really missing is a HALT button or just a
single button that might be configured either for HALT or for RESET. 
 Well, all the problems we are writing abou at the moment are the results
of PCs being PCs and not workstations nor servers.  Actually there may
exist some ia32-based workstations or servers but most products advertised
as such are still PCs.
