Why do you require a header file for this?
Simply put the #warning in gazel.c .
If the API is scheduled for removal, you should put the #warning in the 
header file for the API.
If the API is old but is expected to stay for a longer time, simply do 
nothing. Artificially increasing the warnings during kernel compilation 
only makes it harder to find important warnings.
