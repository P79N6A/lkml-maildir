The usage of magic symlinks shall be kept minimal. 
The asm -> $(ARCH)-asm symlink already has caused me troubles when
doing cross compilation. Also the separate obj tree patch treats
the symlink with special care.
the gain should be high introducing one more symlink.
For what I understood the gain is only to avoid a couple of
one line files that inculde another file. Not enough to justify a 
second symlink IMHO.
