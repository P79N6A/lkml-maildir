Quota side looks sane.  fs/super.c one is an overkill - just set default in
alloc_super().  There is no need to bother with resetting it - in the
places where you do it superblock is already deactivated, so get_super()
in quotactl will not return it and at that point there should be no inodes
left from that filesystem.
