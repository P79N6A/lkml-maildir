I mentioned the following error in another thread:
drivers/char/char.a(msp3400.o): In function `msp3400c_init':
msp3400.o(.text+0x1fe2): undefined reference to `register_sound_mixer'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
In doing some investigation, I found that the problem is that if you
configure sound card support as a module, register_sound_mixer() doesn't
exist in the kernel.  However, if you compile BT848 support built-in at
the same time, the msp3400 driver is built, which calls that function.
[If you're curious, I need to compile sound support as modules to use the
Red Hat configuration tool, but I wasn't bothering with modules for video.]
