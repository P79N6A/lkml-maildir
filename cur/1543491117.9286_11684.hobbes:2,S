Good listers..
	I'm having a problem installing RH 5.2 onto a HP omnibook 4000CT 
(520M HDD, 8M memory).  Your advice would be appreciated..
	Be gentle with your replies, I'm a mewbie...
	I install the RH boot disk and begin installation, I need to 
utilize PCMCIA as the notebook doesn't have a CD, and I was planning on 
using a SMB share over my 10b2 network via the PCMCIA card (xircom CEM2).  
So in goes the Supplemental disk..
	I get into either Disk Druid or fdisk but when I try and add 
partitions and continue the system sort of 'locks up'.  It doesn't crash, 
but the floppy starts seeking something and it stays in that mode {until 
I power it off, I left it running over night without any progress}.  The 
seek pattern is regular and sounds like a possible ramdisk/floppy disk 
swap or the disk has a bad track and we are constantly going to that bad 
track and re-trying.
	I have re-created both the RH boot and supplement disk (rawwrite 
from the windows machine) so I don't think its a corrupt image on the 
floppy.
	I have also tried to install by another method.  I have been able 
to successfully boot off a floppy with muLinux on it and use fdisk to 
partition (and mk2esfk {format ?}) and set dev/hda1 to bootable, BUT I 
have been unable to then figure out how to transfer a operating system 
(lilo ?) on it.  and then I would need to get the PCMCIA devices 
working.. then SMB.. etc..
	Does anyone have any {reasonably} simple ideas on how to achieve 
what I'm trying to do ?  I _really_ don't want to have to load W95 on 
this machine but my frustration level is rising (and time is running 
short) so it's starting to look more likely.
	Of course the best option would be if somebody was prepared to 
loan me a CD drive that was HP omnibook compatibe, but that might just be 
stretching the friendship... :-)
	Thanks in advance...
