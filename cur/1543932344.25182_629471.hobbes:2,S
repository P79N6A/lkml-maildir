Thanks. This is a bug in iwlwifi.
The problem is actually another case where my workqueue debugging with
lockdep is triggering a warning :))
Here's the thing:
iwl3945_cancel_deferred_work does 
cancel_delayed_work_sync(&priv->init_alive_start);
(which is the "(&(&priv->init_alive_start)->work)" lock)
but it is called from within a locked section of
mutex_lock(&priv->mutex); (locked from iwl3945_pci_suspend)
On the other hand, the task that runs from the init_alive_start
workqueue is iwl3945_bg_init_alive_start() which will lock the same
mutex.
So the deadlock condition is that you can be in
cancel_delayed_work_sync() above while the mutex is locked, and be
waiting for iwl_3945_bg_init_alive_start() which tries to lock the
mutex.
