Try hitting the hardware function key that swaps the CRT/LCD and/or the 
function key that changes the font.
Works on my laptop.  Really annoying two-fold issue.  First, the screen 
is blank, second, I have to blindly run setfont to change the garbage 
font to a readable font.
I'm not running an fb, just an nvidia card in text mode on a Dell 
Inspiron 8200.
