On non-Intel platforms, with no dedicated IOIO opcodes, IOIO is
usually implemented as a specific memory range.  In that case, the
only way to allow user-space access to it would be to mmap() that
range... which means iopl() inb() and outb() on those platforms might
be implemented either as open, readp and writep, respectively, or by
iopl() being open() followed by mmap().
