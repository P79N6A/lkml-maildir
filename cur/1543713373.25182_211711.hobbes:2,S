this is greatly appreciated, thanks!

I'm unsure about the arch/ppc/mm/pgtable.c part, I mean, ppc is being
tested heavily, how can it be necessary if nobody ever got an oops yet? 
OTOH your patch certainly cannot hurt and it might be needed after all.
Maybe I should apply it after all, it'd be nice to get a comment on this
bit from ppc people who knows tlb.c better to be sure.
The rest is definitely necessary of course (especially the return NULL
on ppc64 ;).
