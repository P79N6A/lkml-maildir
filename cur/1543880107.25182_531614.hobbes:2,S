If the obsolete tag is to be removed then it needs a formal maintainer,
all the obsolete interface usage cleaning up and the like otherwise at
some point in a clean up it is going to end up breaking and migrating to
&& BROKEN as well.
If that is going to get done (by Karsten or someone else given Karsten
appears totally occupied on other stuff) then great.
