one could do a symlink/hardlink parallel tree for a specific snapshot with
GIT tools, and then only poll that with git-unaware copy tools.
I guess this would make sense for the most common kernel development lines.
Another improvement would be to add a "secondary storage fetch" script, so
the git tools can, if they cant find a object by hash just query an external
pool. In combination with the above this will allow users to compare progress.
