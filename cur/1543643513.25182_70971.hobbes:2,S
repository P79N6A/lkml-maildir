True, however, it's really amazing what a wide range of kernel problems
UML does faithfully reproduce.  It is, after all, just another port.  You
could make the same argument about MIPS distorting timings vis a vis i386.

Oh, and there is another big suckage in UML in the area of modules, you
have to load the symbols by hand, which is just enough pain to make it
not worth compiling things as modules in UML.  Jeff has reasons why its
hard to get gdb to load the module symbols automatically, but hopefully,
that is another problem we can dig into now that UML is officially part
of the tree.
