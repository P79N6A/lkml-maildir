"Me" happens to be "Me sitting at a desk top doing word processing, IRC,
some Quake3 and Doom, listening to music, playing with Gimp, watching
videos, and running firefox."  I'm assuming "me" == "99% of all desktop
users," and that we also can't predict what all specialized machines need.

I see you're trying to lead me into saying we should be more focused on
supplying exactly what works for 100% of everybody, which we can't do.

Something I wrote once
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaX
- --CLIP--
A DoS attack (or its equivalent) is generally an annoyance, and may in
some situations cause loss of time or resources (e.g. lost sales for a
business whose website is affected): however, no data should be
compromised when PaX intervenes, as no information will be improperly
copied elsewhere. Nevertheless, the equivalent of a DoS attack is in
some environments unacceptable; some businesses have level of service
contracts or other conditions which make successful intruder entry a
less costly problem than loss of or reduction in service. The PaX
approach is thus not well suited to all circumstances; however, in many
cases, it is an acceptable method of protecting confidential information
by preventing successful security breaches.
- --CLIP--
This doesn't just apply to PaX or Gr or whatever you want to claim I'm
trying to get into the kernel right now; it applies to everything.  In
some cases anything can be bad.  The idea is to realize that these are
*specialized* cases, and make a design decision:  A) allow a quick way
to disable the stuff (finegrained runtime with executable flags, or
disable in kernel); B) let the 1/100000000000000 people who this bothers
write a patch to change it themselves (RTLinux for example).

This is true.  I however have something like 300M of e-mail and I'm
subscribed to something like 15 or 20 mailing lists for about a year
now.  You of course have a work-around:  Don't try to load 800 gigs of
e-mail into memory all at once.  If you need to *quickly* parse this,
this may not be an acceptable work-around (though reading ahead and
dumping after processing, i.e. buffering, may be a good middle-ground).
Like I said, it's not something you'll hit every day on every machine,
and it's something that can be quickly worked around.  In the worst
case, disable all enhancements on the binary (using chpax or execstack
or whatever for whatever ASLR/NX system and God knows what else you're
using) for that binary or the system, depending on how fine-grained you
can control it.
I sympathise, really, but you're that one in ten-jillion.  :)

The fastest way is ALWAYS in memory :)  (unless you have $12000 SATA
drives with 2G of on-board cache and 500 track read-ahead)
