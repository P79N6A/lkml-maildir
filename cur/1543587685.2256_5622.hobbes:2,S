a degraded raid will not deliver broken data. and even if it does, one more
reason not to check a degraded raid.

fsck does not neet to be changed, yoi can have a shell script loop and check
the raid state before caling the fsck.

fixed as in rebuild, thats what we where tlking about, no?

yes would be a nice feature if rebuild can be made to only to io which is
required by the kernel anyway. since fsck will reach a lot of meta data this
is a fairly good start for a slow rebuild.
