With the latest e2fsprogs and 2.6 kernels, the online resizing support
has been merged in, and as long as the filesystem was created with
space reserved for growing the filesystem (which is now the default,
or if the filesystem has the off-line prepration step ext2prepare run
on it), you can run resize2fs on a mounted filesystem and grow an
ext2/3 filesystem on-line.  And yes, you get more inodes as you add
more disk blocks, using the original inode ratio that was established
when the filesystem was created.
