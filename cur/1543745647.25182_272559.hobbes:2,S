Don't forget write() too. If someone does a write, that would have to be
written over the mapping too. Obviously this is not impossible.

It'd probably have to be something like an md5 sum.
Okay, technically, we could probably emulate it, but is it worth it? I think
it's something to bear in mind for another time.
More to the point, perhaps, is making shared memory stuff work.
