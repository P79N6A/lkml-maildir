No.  I do not claim that his problem was caused by the stats.
It is just that I get reports from people with mysterious mount
and fdisk problems that go away when CONFIG_BLK_STATS is disabled.
And requests from RedHat to put ugly patches into mount to
tell stdio to use a larger buffer, increasing the probability that
all is read in one go.

Good!
So the very reproducible problem is solved, and only the
sporadic random problem is left.
I still hope that you will remove it again.
