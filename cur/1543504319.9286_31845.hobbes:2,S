I think that most kernel hackers agree, that it's a good thing to have
threads handled like processes with some special features wrt VM, signals,
... 
This allows the kernel (scheduler) and all the tools (ps, top, gdb, ...) to
just magically work. I see no technical reason to change it.
(And I don't accept, that it looks nicer to see only one PID for one
 multithreaded app as a technical reason.)
I believe linuxthreads will have different pids for different threads in the
future.
Just my 2¤ (<=\texteuro)
