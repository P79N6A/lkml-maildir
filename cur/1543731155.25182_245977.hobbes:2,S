Think of it as being like VFS, where you can plugin new filesystems.  
Only in this case, you can plugin new kinds of files, and everything you 
need to implement those new kinds of files (items, nodes, keys, 
processing before flushing to disk, etc.) also gets implemented as a 
plugin.  It is an Uber-VFS.

I am not concerned about ram in this design, I want nifty new kinds of 
files easy crafted over a weekend by sysadmins working in Canada and 
Guatemala.  Software engineering cost is what matters to me ( I turned 
40, so I think different now....;-) )
