Hi all,
I've been hacking the ethernet bridging code present in stock
2.2 kernels. So far I've done multiple bridge port groups and
dynamic adding/removing of devices. However, I'm clueless about
submitting this to someone. Is there anyone out there willing
to test my patches? Is there anyone out there who can provide
me an FTP home for this? (my ISP is a bit weird. they do not
allow anon ftp access, but http access to my ~ mangles the
file names. But visit 
http://www.dsv.nl/~buytenh
 if you want to
try.) Also: what is the status of the current bridging code?
No one seems to be maintaining it?? Why is it still experimental?
Who uses it? etc. etc.
Please CC your responses as I have only a prehistoric 2400 bps
(dont laugh) :-(
