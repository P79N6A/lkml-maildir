Unrelated to your change, but...
We prefer min_t over casts like this (not sure why, but let's be consistent)
The reason for this cast is that all this code is using `int' for the
transfer count (arguably wrong - should use size_t, but that propagates all
the way to tty_operations.write) but cyclades has
#define SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE        (min(PAGE_SIZE, 4096))
which is unsigned on most architectures.
A possibly-sane fix for all of this is to use min_t in the above then nuke
the casts.
