I've had the same problem before.
The answer was in my configuration.  Make sure your options are chosen
correctly in the processor section of configuration.  If you need help, look
at a previous .config file you have.  Or, check out a stock .config file
from Redhat or another vendor where the kernel boots fine. The problem is
that you have some option checked that is not compatible with you
processor - or so was the case with mine.

You have probably optimized your kernel for the wrong processor.  Double
check that and try again.
