Mandatory access control (MAC) prevents them from mounting tmpfs on top of /dev .
MAC mediates namespace manipulation requests such as mount()/umount().

MAC mediates execution of /sbin/iptables or /usr/bin/passwd .
So, use of this filesystem alone is meaningless because
attackers with root privileges can do what you are saying.
But use of this filesystem with MAC is still valid because
MAC can prevent attackers with root privileges from doing what you are saying.
