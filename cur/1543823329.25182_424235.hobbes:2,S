Hi,
   I am trying to write an sdio driver.
   I have sent command 52 with argument of 0x00001000 to get the block size.
   In return i get an response of 0x00001000 which indicates that the
CRC Check of the previous   command failed.
   The last command i sent was command 7 and it returned success.
   Any clues where the problem could be?.
Regards,
sriram
