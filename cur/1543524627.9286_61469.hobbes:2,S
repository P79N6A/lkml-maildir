Could you please wait with this patch? It's unclear if it's allowed or
illegal to call __get_free_page() while "current->state !=
TASK_RUNNING". __pollwait() does exactly that.
I've written a similar patch, but I'll wait until the allocation problem
has settled down (the "2.2.15pre5: still very unstable" thread).
And _pollwait() ignores oom. Hmm. I think my patch is required. I'll
merge your changes and forward the result to Linus. Ok?
