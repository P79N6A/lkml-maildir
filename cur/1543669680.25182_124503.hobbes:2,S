Um, how do you show a symlink to a device that is no long there when the
device is removed?  :)
It would also require that users can delete files from sysfs, which
isn't currently possible.  Special casing one directory for this would
be a pain.
In the end, it's a nice idea, but the current one is much simpler, and
works today :)
