Hi all,
	Lguest is a simple hypervisor which runs Linux under Linux, without
needing VT hardware.
	Two people asked if I had a version of lguest which worked on
other-than-bleeding-edge-mm kernels, so I did a backport of the latest
version to 2.6.21.
	
http://lguest.ozlabs.org/lguest-2.6.21-254.patch.gz
See Documentation/lguest/lguest.txt for how to run,
drivers/lguest/README for the draft code documentation journey.
Bug or even success reports always welcome!
Rusty.
Quickstart:
$ cd linux-2.6.21
$ zcat /tmp/lguest-2.6.21-254.patch.gz | patch -p1
$ make
	- Say "y" to CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, "m" to CONFIG_LGUEST.
$ make modules_install
$ make -C Documentation/lguest
$ sudo Documentation/lguest/lguest --block=<some-convenient-raw-image> \
	128 vmlinux root=/dev/lgba
Three ^C's within one second will kill the guest.
