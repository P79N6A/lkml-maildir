NO. 
Please don't do this, it will result in some _really_ nasty problems with 
X and other programs that potentially disable interrupts in user space.
Also, there are broken old drivers that potentially have interrupts 
disabled, and we shouldn't just oops them. We should have a warning, but 
we already do have that: that's what "might_sleep()" does.
So something like this may be appropriate at some point, but not in this 
format. At the very least you absolutely _have_ to check for user mode 
(possibly in the same place where we now have that
	/* It's safe to allow irq's after cr2 has been saved */
comment).
