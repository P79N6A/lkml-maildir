I wonder if that SCSI fix (restoring a wrongly deleted mem clear) helps
get rid of this oops too?

I'd have stopped at "wouldn't make any difference"; the kernel must make
some initial choice, but userspace is free to revise it.  Agreed it would
be odd if altsettings had different class/subclass/protocol, but I don't
see any good reason to make that illegal.

Erm, no; that's a per-configuration thing, not a per-altsetting thing.
It's checking the config descriptor, not the interface descriptor,
for that particular concern.

I think that's not true, and it would be worth verifying that it's not
a no-interfaces device even if the USB spec required it.  It's trivial
to create device firmware that advertises no-interfaces, and those should
never be able to make Linux hiccup (much less oops).

Right; there's always at least one setting.  Calling them "alt" settings
can be confusing; any one of them could be the "main" setting.
