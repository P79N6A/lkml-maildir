Looking at this, it seems like the classification stuff for 32-bit is
generic, it's just the compat bits that are special cased and wrap back
in through the 32-bit classifier.
Is there any point in keeping the 32-bit audit.c rather than simply
moving it to kernel/ or lib/ and leaving the arch/ bits as compat
wrappers only?
At least powerpc, x86, and ia64 look like they could go that way.
