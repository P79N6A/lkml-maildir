It makes sense. If you're going to use MTD drivers for other partitions
of the flash, you want to be able to co-ordinate with it so you know
when the flash is being written to. You want to be able to use its
partitioning rather than hard-coding the physical address and length of
what might be a dynamic partition. You want the MTD driver to know that
the device in question is in use.
