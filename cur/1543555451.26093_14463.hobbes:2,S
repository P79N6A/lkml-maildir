WOAH, STOP!!!  You say "lost"???
Under NO circumstances should klogd or ksymoops mangle the
original oops. The raw oops data MUST be completely preserved.
It is a serious bug that this is not what currently happens.

1. this is harmless

Nope. You get the unmolested oops and some symbol data.
If there isn't any symbol for 0x424a5149, so what? It is
no big deal to look up a few opcodes in the symbol table
by accident.

That would be trading one design flaw for another.
The hard part of klogd/ksymoops is decoding the code bytes AFAIK.
The rest is a just a cross between grep and ps -- you search and
you do symbol lookups. I could throw it together in a few hours,
minus the disassembly part.
Hey, anybody ever think about splitting the kernel message buffer
to be per-CPU or keeping interrupt context separate from process
context? Not that I've looked at it, but locking might be reduced.
