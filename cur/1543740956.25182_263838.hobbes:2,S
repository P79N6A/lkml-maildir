You didn't understand.
An absolutely necessary information regarding kernel source is the
kernel version number, the tree (-mm, -ac, ...) and/or source URL where
the information (be it a bug report, a kernel oops or false accusations)
is related to.
Simply stating "the linux kernel" has no relevant meaning in any of
these cases.
