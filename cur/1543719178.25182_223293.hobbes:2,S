If the page is "even" the thread_info is at the top of the stack. If the
page is "odd" the thread_info is at the bottom of the stack (or the
other way around depending what you mean with "odd" and "even").
the per-cpu irq stack will have the thread_info at both the top and the
bottom of the 8k naturally aligned order1 compound page. The regular
kernel stack will have it at the top or the bottom depending if it's odd
or even.
this should allow 8k irqstack and bh stack fine at in-cpu-core speed w/o
segments or similar.
The only downside is that itadds a branch to current_thread_info that
will have to check the 12th bitflag in the esp before doing andl, the
second downside is having to update two thread_info during irq, instead
of just one.
It would be probably better if the thread_info was just a pointer to a
"pda" instead of being the PDA itself so there are just two writes into
the kernel stack for every irq. In x86-64 this is much more natural
since the pda-pointer is in the cpu 64bit %gs register and that saves a
branch and defereference on the stack for every "current" invocation,
and two writes for every first-irq or first-bh.
