Currently even if you're not connected to the network it's fine. As long
as you connect sometime. If a packet manages to get sent to the sever in
a window when you're connected your stats will be fine and the seconds
of uptime will be checked against the time it passed on the server.

That shouldn't be the case. Anyway I can trivially detect the suspended
systems, so if you want I can add a tag like "suspended" on the right of
the table (in the future we can add filters in the main page so you can
filter out the archs you don't want, smp etc..).
