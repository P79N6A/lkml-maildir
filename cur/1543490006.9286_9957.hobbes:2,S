Never fear a chipset code for tuning PIIX's is in the loop.
Sheesh, if pronouce this phrase, it sounds like tweaking a fairy.
Seriously this is an ugly to reproduce in the same class as the PDC20246,
since we are overriding a BIOS configuration.
Mark have you got a set of tuning rules based on the pci-config space?
I have the rest of the code, just need the BIOS key to fill the blank.
