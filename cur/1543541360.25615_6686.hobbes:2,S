On my laptop (Dell Laititude CPi A366XT, 366 MHz PII, 128MB RAM), kernel
2.4.0-test6 locks up on boot right after trying to start the pcmcia stuff if
I have my modem (3Com Megahertz 56K 3CXM756) in. I get all but one of the
normal beeps, the light on the ethernet card comes on, and then the system
completely locks up. Hard. No error messages, etc. It boots fine with only
the ethernet card in. If I insert the modem after boot, it locks up hard
again with no beeps and no error messages.
Anyone else seeing this behavior?
