This would be a problem for short-lived processes. Because "map in
all pages" also means "zero them out".  And I think that performing
a 4k clear_user_highpage() immediately before returning to userspace
is optimal.  It's essentialy a cache preload for userspace.
If we instead clear out 4 or 8 pages, we trash a ton of cache and
the chances of userspace _using_ pages 1-7 in the short-term are
lower.   We could clear the pages with 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 ordering,
but the cache implications of faultahead are still there.
Could we establish the eight pte's but still arrange for pages 1-7
to trap, so the kernel can zero the out at the latest possible time?

On the nopage path, yes.  That memory is cache-cold anyway.
