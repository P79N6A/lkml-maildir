I can confirm this passes my boot, shutdown, reboot test that failed with
2.4.15-greased-turkey.  2.4.15-viro1 is currently running my kernel build
tests quite happily thus far.
I think 2.4.15-greased-turkey should be renamed to 2.4.15-dead-duck. 8)
Al, thanks for the fast response.  Appologies for the slow build.
