    Not an easy fix, then. I've read the thread that this message
originated, and I think that the better solucion, in the short term I
mean, is to symlink /etc/mtab to a proper writeable place in the
filesystem. Anyway, I think that this kind of 'traditional' things
should go away and better solutions used instead. My particular
problem is that *I* don't have better solutions (at least
implemented...).
    Thanks a lot for the interest :)
