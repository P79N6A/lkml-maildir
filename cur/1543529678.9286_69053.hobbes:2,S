yep, of course. It's a grave error to schedule during IRQ contexts, and we
do have an assert in schedule() so it's plain impossible. The lowlatency
patch simply works by increasing the effective frequency (occurance) of
rescheduling (preemption) points [without actually rescheduling more
often].
Having said this, i now do agree that doing a preemptible kernel (which
the Linux SMP kernel could become with a small amount of work) is a
superior solution to this, wrt. latencies.
