PIC code on the x86 reserves the %ebx register for an offset pointer,
but the syscall interface defines %ebx as the first argument of a
syscall.  Glibc works around this by pushing and popping %ebx around the
syscall.  You would need something like this:
#define _syscall1(type,name,type1,arg1) \
type name(type1 arg1) \
{ \
long __res; \
__asm__ volatile ("pushl %%ebx; movl %2, %%ebx; int $0x80; popl %%ebx" \
        : "=a" (__res) \
        : "0" (__NR_##name),"g" ((long)(arg1))); \
__syscall_return(type,__res); \
}
