The problem was that the DMA API didn't work for x86_64 when I wrote the 
driver. I see now that it has been fixed.
isa_virt_to_bus still works even though CONFIG_ISA is not configured. So 
I still think that the ISA dependency should be removed.
I'll move to the new API when I have the time to properly test it.
