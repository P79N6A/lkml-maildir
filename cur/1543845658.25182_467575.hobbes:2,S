I wouldn't say it was extensively tested, but no, there's checks for the
value "none" and it does indeed fail to discover any devices ;-)

I must confess to having not thought about how userspace probes a
scsi host to find out what devices are behind it.  This was a feature
that James asked for and it was easy to add.

Note that by specifying "none", not even the FC/SAS/etc drivers can
register targets as they find them -- it really is up to userspace to
echo scsi-add-single-device H C T L >/proc/scsi/scsi
I'm a little uncomfortable with that, and I'd be open to adding another
word that means "no scanning, but if the driver's been told about the
device by a switch, add it automatically, don't wait for userspace".
I do think that none needs to mean none though.

That would be up to userspace in the "none" view of the world.  I could
see people wanting to ignore the self-configuring expander and impose
a new (incorrect) topology on the system.
BTW, there'll be a lucky version 13 in a few minutes ...
shost_for_each_device_safe isn't.
