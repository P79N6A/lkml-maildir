Not that much actually. It avoids having to gather them all in the last
stage at the low level but that isn't really related to what we are
talking about right now.

kernel preemption and SMP have nothing to do with it. You can still
schedule because one of the driver suspend() callback is schedul'ing,
maybe waiting for some requests to complete, etc... Happens typically
with the disk suspend callbacks.
I agree that it does lower the likelyness of having a userspace process
pound on the wrong driver at the wrong time though.
