ok so this is actually a per pci device property!
I would suggest moving this property to the pci device itself, not doing
it inside an edac directory.
by doing that you get the advantage that 1) it's a more logical place,
and 2) users can do it even for 1 of 2 cards, if they have 2 cards of
the same make and 3) you can use the generic kernel quirk interface for
this and 4) drivers can in principle control this for their hardware in
complex cases 
I understand that on a PC, EDAC is the only user. but ppc has a similar
mechanism I suspect, and they more than likely would be able to share
this property....
