Looks like a stream of IRQs getting delivered before
the chip was initialized ... interrupts that shouldn't
have been arriving.  Do you have funky BIOS settings?
Does this happen if you don't use ACPI?  I've had
reports of folk using NForce2 boards that needed
to use "acpi=off", since ACPI didn't initialize
the interrupts correctly.  Yours seems to be at
least partially correct.
