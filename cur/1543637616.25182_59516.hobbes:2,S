And if you look at the ratio between the access time of ram
which is in the low nanoseconds (1* 10 ^ -9) (data and address must be
present for at least
the rated number of ns to guarantee a sucessful read or write). and compare
it to
the seek + rotational delay of a discrete spindal which is in low
milliseconds (1* 10 ^ -3) that puts you at
a ratio of about 1000000.
