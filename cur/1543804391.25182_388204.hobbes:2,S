The related patch had some (I think duplex related) 
issues with setting up certain NICs. It's reverted in 2.6.16-rc1-mm1.
I'm about to work out the problems of this patch.
The driver version did not increase since more than three years.
But perhaps it is a good idea to maintain the driver version.
