Right so that it works in O(1) if you're doing sequential I/O.

Correct. The request out of latency units will become a barrier and
nothing will be allowed to pass it.

Yes, it have to tell to the other requests that they are being delayed.

Yes, in the sense of I/O request (not `struct request').

Correct.

Here you're talking about the latency control logic.

The algorithm that control the latency and the one that enforce the
ordering are two separate things.
For example in 2.2.15 there's only the latter (2.2.15 was missing a
latency control mechanism).

We're not using a SCAN ordering algorithm it's instead a CSCAN. The queue
can be for istance:
	12 13 14 1 2 3
Now insert 15 (assume 15 is the last sector of the disk):
	12 13 14 15 1 2 3
as you can see the higher block number of the HD will wait less time than
1 2 3 (it will pass 1 2 and 3, of course assuming they are fresh requests
and they still have some latency unit to spend).
SCAN instead would have a fairness problem where the middle of the disk
gets less latency but SCAN as well goes backwards and it's not know how
well it works in all the hardware out there. (I think that's one of the
main reasons we use CSCAN instead)

PS. Thanks for having read and understood the internals of the 2.4.x
elevator before posting your comments, it simplifies very much the
communication.
