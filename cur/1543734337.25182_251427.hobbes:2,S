That could only happen if max_steps were initialized to PIDMAP_ENTRIES
instead of PIDMAP_ENTRIES + 1, so this more accurate upper bound is not
strictly necessary, though with this in place, we could probably reduce
max_steps to just PIDMAP_ENTRIES so we cycle no further than the block
we began; I'll not bother with that.
