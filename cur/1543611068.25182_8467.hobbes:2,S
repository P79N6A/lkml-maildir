Forgive me if this winds up being stupidity, but I am not much of a
coder and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope troubleshooting this
issue.
I have a Memorex 48x and HP 9100i CD drives on my system, using
ide-scsi, both drives are detected fine, but no matter what ide
controller or slave/master configuration I try, I'm having real
problems with timeouts reading from them.  Specifically ripping tracks
from audio CD's.  I think I might need to increase the timeout and
wasn't able to grok from ide-scsi.c where to do so, thus this letter.
Here are some stats.
Both drives have been tried with multiple IDE cables, and in any
combination as master/slave and on controller channels with another
master/slave or alone.
I have tried disabling DMA, forcing PIO4 and results have been reduced
function to no function at all.
Best possible combination is the CDR HP drive as slave on second
channel alone, but still times out.
Both drives are known good under other OS's in the same configuration.
Both drives functioned properly quite a while back under 2.0.x
kernels.
Kernel versions all with same errors 2.2.19, 2.2.20, 2.4.13, 2.4.16
The errors I'm getting;
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
scsi_read error: sector=15622 length=1 retry=4
                 Sense key: 3 ASC: 2 ASCQ: 0
		 Transport error: Medium reading data from medium
                 System error: Input/output error
