I solved the problem with dualhead!!!
Second head from 2.4.3 is /dev/fb2 rather than /dev/fb1.
Just had to look to the messages.
About matroxfb + X11 what I have seen is that if you use the same
resolution with the same number of colors as in X11 ,most of the times it will
work(except if I am in the login manager kdm!Then if I change to console
it will have the same screen).
P.S. Petr on the second head if I put mouse in the right-corner at the
bottom of the screen I will have a nice white border around the screen.
Also cursor blinks very strange if there is a lot of move on another
framebuffer on the first head and leaves some white blocks around.
I have used software and hardware cursor.
