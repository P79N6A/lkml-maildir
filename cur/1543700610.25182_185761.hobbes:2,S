First of all, eventhou I'm the maintainer of cryptoloop, when Christophe
posted the first time I immediately recognized that dm-crypt is vastly
superior to cryptoloop for a number of reasons:
.) It does not suffer from loop.c bugs (There are a lot, no maintainer)
.) dm-crypt does not depend on special user space tool (util-linux)
.) dm-crypt uses mempool, which makes it rock stable compared to cryptoloop. 
From an operational point of view, patching util-linux has been the most
troublesome point. Lot's of incompatible inofficial patches floating around
in the net, while the last release of util-linux provides a broken and IMHO
insecure why of setting up cryptokeys. Further: To fix the design flaw of
unencrypted/unhashed IV vectors one has to add another setup parameter.
That's where I really do like the flexible interface dm has.

We should support cryptoloop. No new features, but working well. At the same
time we should declare it 'deprecated' and provide dm-crypt as alternative.
I'm happy to provide documentation on how to migrate.
I will review Christophe's patch as well as test compatiblity with
cryptoloop. Expect my results in a few days.
