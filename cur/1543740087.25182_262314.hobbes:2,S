great! I've uploaded -U8.1 with this fix included:

note that the keyboard and USB interrupts are SCHED_OTHER by default, so
they could be delayed quite long depending on the workload. To avoid
that i'd suggest to:
        chrt --fifo --pid 30 `pidof 'IRQ 1'`
        chrt --fifo --pid 30 `pidof 'IRQ 12'`
(do this for every IRQ you have for input devices.) This puts them below
jackd's priority (which is FIFO 50 iirc) but above all SCHED_OTHER
tasks. The soundcard IRQ i guess you have chrt-ed already?
or did you have them on SCHED_FIFO already?
