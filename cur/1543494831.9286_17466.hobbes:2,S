congratulation, you found a bug in lint;)
or just think that it's an `error' in lint's mind to write such ugly code
(which looks like Pascal code;) -- but lint's mind and lint itself isn't part
of the C language standard.

can you please explain what `assignment was tested' means in C language ?
and an you please show where K&R or ANSI C explain what it means that
an `assignment (does not) succeed' and how this ever shall happen ?
does this test check if the value already was stored ?
was stored in main memory? stored in L2 cache?  in L1 cache?  
in a register variable ?!
and how ever should such a test, if a value got stored, fail in C ?
do you expect to read back memory (register, cache, ...) and compare
it with the original value to be stored ?!
