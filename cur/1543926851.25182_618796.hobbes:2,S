Subject: [PATCH] task_pid_nr_ns() breaks proc_pid_readdir()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

proc_pid_readdir:
	for (...; ...; task = next_tgid(tgid + 1, ns)) {
		tgid = task_pid_nr_ns(task, ns);
		... use tgid ...
The first problem is that task_pid_nr_ns() can race with RCU and read the
freed memory.
However, rcu_read_lock() can't help. next_tgid() returns a pinned task_struct,
but the task can be released (and it's pid detached) before task_pid_nr_ns()
reads the pid_t value. In that case task_pid_nr_ns() returns 0 thus breaking
the whole logic.
Make sure that task_pid_nr_ns() returns !0 before updating tgid. Note that
next_tgid(tgid + 1) can find the same "struct pid" again, but we shouldn't
go into the endless loop because pid_task(PIDTYPE_PID) must return NULL in
this case, so next_tgid() can't return the same task.
