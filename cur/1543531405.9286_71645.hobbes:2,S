	The modules from VMWare 2.0 (build 476) doesn't compile anymore on kernel
2.3.99-pre2, at least not the vmnet-only part. The errors are:
netif.c: In function `VNetNetifOpen':
netif.c:350: structure has no member named `tbusy'
netif.c:351: structure has no member named `interrupt'
netif.c:352: structure has no member named `start'
netif.c: In function `VNetNetifClose':
netif.c:400: structure has no member named `start'
netif.c:401: structure has no member named `tbusy'
netif.c: In function `VNetNetifStartXmit':
netif.c:441: structure has no member named `tbusy'
netif.c:453: structure has no member named `tbusy'
make: *** [netif.o] Error 1
	The offending file is attached.
	On 2.3.48 VMWare builds ok, but i didn't tryied other kernels between 48
and 99-pre2.
