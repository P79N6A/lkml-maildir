Would you like a pessimistic answer, or an optimistic answer?
Pessimistic answer: any Makefile can play with any variable that it
feels like at any time.  Think 'Windows Registry', with bonus points
for achieving subtle effects by using delayed '=' assignment.
Optimistic answer: first, I have documented the existing setup.  Second,
I'll try some more to get my documentation merged.  Third, anyone who cares
(including me) can refine the docs to track each variable precisely and
fix the code so that each distinct variable belongs to one authority.

    % grep 'CROSS_COMPILE.*=' arch/*/Makefile
    arch/mips/Makefile:CROSS_COMPILE  = $(tool-prefix)
    arch/mips64/Makefile:CROSS_COMPILE  = $(tool-prefix)
    arch/sh/Makefile:CROSS_COMPILE  = $(tool_prefix)
