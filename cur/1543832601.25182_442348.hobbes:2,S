Yes we can't really make it optional. There are reasons to use GFP_DMA
even without ISA. Also on x86-64 CONFIG_ISA is never set so it would
completely eliminate GFP_DMA, which we can't do.
That said however nearly users of GFP_DMA outside arch/* are wrong.
They should be all audited and convered to use the PCI DMA API instead.

There are also devices with 31 or 30 bits that also fall back to GFP_DMA
and a couple of other cases.
