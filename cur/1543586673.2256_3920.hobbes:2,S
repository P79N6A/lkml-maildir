The first problem you are running into is mixing user space with kernel
code.  You cannot use pthreads in the kernel... not directly anyways.  You
could use kernel_thread() instead.
If your future stack will have a BSD socket interface you could prototype
your server in user space - and use pthreads.  If you don't want the
interface then you can hook into the stack directly by using the sock_*
functions (see include/linux/net.h).  You will probably get everything you
need to start you off from an article by Alessandro Rubini at the Linux
