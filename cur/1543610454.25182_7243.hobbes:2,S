I've been manually gzipping the kernel for Sparc64, just gzip the built
kernel, and copy to your boot partition.  Then follow the normal setup
steps, and This works fine.  There is an initial size limit IIRC, of about
over 2mb.  Trimming it down, and gzipping has been working great for me.  
Hope this helps,
Bruce H.

Subject: Sparc64 Compiles OK, but won't boot new kernel
Hi,
I have been able to successfully compile the 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 kernels
for Sparc64 but each gives me an error on boot-up:
Image to large for Destination  (twice)
It then kicks me back to the silo prompt.  My kernel is trimmed back
quite a bit and there isn't a lot there.  
It's not a compressed kernel -- should it be?  How do I do that since
the bzImage make is missing from the Sparc64 makefiles?
I am using Redhat 6.2 on an Enterprise 4000, 4 Ultrasparc-II CPU's and
2Gb of Ram.
Any suggestions??
Norm
