hm.  Aggregating dirty and unstable at inc/dec time is a bit kludgy.  If
later on we want to know just "dirty" then we're in trouble.
I can see the logic behind it though.
Perhaps one could have separate BDI_DIRTY and BDI_UNSTABLE and treat them
separately at inc/dec time, but give them the same numerical value, so
they in fact refer to the same counter.  That's kludgy too.
