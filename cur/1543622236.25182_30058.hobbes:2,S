the userspace library side does it. The kernel patch is the slowpath, the
fast path (no contention) happens in user-space, using SMP-atomic
instructions. It's all very nice and lightweight.
also as far as i can see, this implementation enables semaphores to live
anywhere within the VM, the /dev/usem is just a hack to communicate this
VM address to the kernel-space code. So i think the patch's concepts are
really nice, except the interface cleanliness issue which shouldnt be too
hard to fix - adding new syscalls is pleasant work anyway :-)
