No file like /include/net/tcp.h is used in the compilation of the kernel.
Perhaps you mean ../linux-VERS/include/net/tcp.h (make sure you are
not compiling against some user-space headers).
Also, please fix your mailer line-wrap. Unix/Linux machines put '\n'
on or before the 80th character.
Once you check this out, search through that file, looking for "RTO".
There are many things that affect the retransmit interval. FYI the
current algorithm is correct and the minimum time to retransmit must
not be changed if you put this on a "live" network. If you were to
do this, your Linux machine gets an unfair advantage on a congested
network. This may seem great at first, but eventually your machine
will actually need to receive some some data. By taking over the
wire, you will end up with a bunch of hosts that were backed off,
now trying to jam packets into your machine. The result will be
poor performance because many packets will have to be dumped on
the floor, requiring an eventual retransmit. 
Also, remember to install the new kernel before you re-boot. Some
persons forget that they actually have to install the kernel. They
compile it, smile when it completes, then reboot. 
Cheers,
