Will do.
I was going down the path of using request_firmware but needed to support older 
2.4 kernels as well, so I punted for the time being and stuck with what you 
currently see.
I hope to add the request_firmware approach soon [ always willing to accept a 
patch :) ]
Also, for those that are interested, we have a mailing list set up for the 
driver at 
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ipw2100-devel.
