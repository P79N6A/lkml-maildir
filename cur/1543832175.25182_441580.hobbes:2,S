oh, come on. that's a pretty cheap argument. let me tell you i tried
swsusp (admittedly a while ago) couldn't get it to run reliably on
several laptops, went for suspend2 --- and it worked rather well. i
certainly didn't go for suspend2 because of its "eye candy"...
this is not about eye candy, this is about pragmatism: suspend2 seems to
work on a lot more platforms than what is currently in the kernel.

IIRC correctly he did try earlier and was told to come back when he had
his code subdivided in little pieces.
