Are you still working on this patch?  I'm still figuring that this, or
my 'cpu_must_load_balance' variation, will be our best choice.
The other avenue of pursuit, Nick's suggestion to partition based on
the individual task cpus_allowed masks, is blowing up on me.  Details
below, if it matters to anyone ...

This is a terrible algorithm.  It does a really poor job of finding
optimum (minimum size) sched domain partitions.
For example, if we pinned every task in the system so that it is
either running on the even numbered CPUs, or on the odd numbered CPUs,
this algorithm would miss the obvious partitioning, into even and
odd numbered CPUs.
Or for a more flagrant example, lets say we pinned every single task
but one to a single CPU, and then pinned that last task to a pair of
CPUs, the lowest numbered and the highest numbered CPUs.  Ideally we
would only have a single sched domain partition in the entire system
that needed balancing - a two CPU partition for that last task.
The above algorithm would lump all the CPUs in the system into a
partition, because they are numbered in the range of CPUs covered
by that last task, into a single sched domain partition covering the
entire system.
If people only selected cpus_allowed masks allowing adjacent CPUs, then
this algorithm worked just fine.  That's not a realistic constraint.
A deterministic algorithm for this might be NP-complete, I don't know.
Whether or not a useful approximation exists, I don't know.  And even
if we found one, whether or not it would adequately meet the needs
of high CPU count systems anywhere nearly as well as simply marking
cpusets with flag to indicate which ones define sched domains,
or which ones don't need to be load balanced ... I don't know, but
I'm skeptical.
