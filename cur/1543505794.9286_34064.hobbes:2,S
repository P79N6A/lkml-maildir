My not just *give* them *all* of you bank cards/make them sole controlling party on
all of your accounts - Iam wondering if it's legal to do what these companies do.
If I developed a card  would *want* people to have the specs - it can't do any harm
- other companies will the specs anyway by whatever means they feel needed (catch
my drift? :) so they certainly can't loose anything. If people have the specs, they
can write drivers, etc which can only boost the company's performance.
