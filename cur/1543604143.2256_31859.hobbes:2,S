Actually there is no locking implemented for the ac97 codec mixer.
It never seemed worth it, even if there are potential races in the code.
To have two applications accessing the mixer at the same time is a _very_
rare condition and the worse that can happen is to set a wrong volume
value. Anyway, I will give it another look and try to come up with a fix.
The locking that we care about (mgr->lock) is for the dsp microcode, where
we don't want to have it changing under us. Writing to the wrong
dsp register can have some interesting effects.
