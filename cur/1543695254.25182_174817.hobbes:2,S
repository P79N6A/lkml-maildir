Your 2.6.0-test8 patch from:
  
http://jdike.stearns.org/mirror/uml-patch-2.6.0-test8.bz2
worked for me as well.  It built and booted at least, when applied
to a clean, current as of a few hours ago:
   bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
But your bkbits tree, at:
  
http://jdike.stearns.org:5000/uml-2.5
seems to have something quite different in it than what
I got from the above linux-2.5 + uml-patch-2.6.0-test8.bz2.
Just one UML relevant example of what I see different:
================ arch/um/kernel/Makefile ================
48c50
< QUOTE = 'my $$config=`cat $(TOPDIR)/.config`; $$config =~ s/"/\\"/g ; while(<STDIN>) { $$_ =~ s/CONFIG/$$config/; print $$_ }'

> QUOTE = 'my $$config=`cat $(TOPDIR)/.config`; $$config =~ s/"/\\"/g ; $$config =~ s/\n/\\n"\n"/g ; while(<STDIN>) { $$_ =~ s/CONFIG/$$config/; print $$_ }'
The '<' is from your bkbits tree, and didn't compile.
The '>' is from applying your patch, and works.
I see many other differences as well, most seemgingly unrelated
to UML.
