I thought we'd been fairly good about that, actually.  The -rc1's always
come too early for me (I usually wait for all the bk merges to happen). 
But once we hit -rc2 people are good?  At least, I think I've only ever
seen one "ytf did you merge that now" email...

That's number-of-lines-of-patch versus day, from the bk-commits list. 
There's definitely a pattern there ;)
