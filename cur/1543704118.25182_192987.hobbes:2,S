Hello!

Looks good, but there are still some places to polish (in addition to
Andrew's comments):
> +	  to access the pci configuration space through enhanced config
> +	  access mechanism (Will work only on PCI Express based system)
"pci" should be "PCI".
> +	mcfg = (struct acpi_table_mcfg *) __acpi_map_table
> +						(phys_addr, size);
Wrapping long lines is good, but you seem to overdo it.
> +	printk(KERN_INFO PREFIX "Local  mcfg address %p\n",
> +			mcfg->base_address);
Again -- you should be consistent in usign caps: "MCFG", not "mcfg".
> +#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_EXPRESS
> +	else if (!strcmp(str, "no_pcie")) {
Why "no_pcie" with an underscore when existing switches ("noacpi", "nobios"
etc.) don't have one?

Why printing such a enormous banner for reporting a trivial error?
One line is enough.

"PCI:Using" -> "PCI: Using".

PCI_EXPRES -> PCI_EXPRESS
Also, linking the same object twice doesn't look right.

We really shouldn't scan the capability list during each access to /proc/bus/pci.
Better calculate the configuration space size when probing the device
and put it to struct pci_dev.

Header files should not contain static variables.

Why is this inline?

If the base_address is 64-bit and you stuff it in a 32-bit variable, you
should check the upper 32 bits and in case they are non-zero, print an error
message.
				Have a nice fortnight
