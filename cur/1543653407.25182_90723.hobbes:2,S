Cool.  I was pretty certain it would get into Linux but the fact the device
drivers are not hanging up is a real plus.

Yep.  I really haven't tracked and fixed the cause of the hang,
I just avoided the issue entirely.  Eventually I will come back
and look into what it takes to improve the odds of having BIOS calls,
work.  --real-mode restores the old kexec behavior.
All of the real changes were to the user space code.  The kernel
patch stayed the same.

Or you can write a routine to gather that information dynamically and send
me a patch for /sbin/kexec.  Though it may take another proc file to do
that one properly.
