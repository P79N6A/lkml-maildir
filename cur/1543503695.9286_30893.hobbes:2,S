Ever wanted to know exactly what happens at every moment
in your machine. What process gets scheduled in, what 
others out, why? Tried to resolve complexe synchronization
problems to no avail? Find /proc and the likes not enough
for your needs ... Well this might come in handy
The Linux Trace Toolkit enables it's user to know exactly
what happened in a system at all times and why it happens.
It consists of 4 software parts, which together acheive
the desired functionnality. These are :
1) A modified kernel that logs critical events.
2) A kernel module that buffers the events (this is viewed
   as a char device in user space).
3) A daemon that empties the trace device buffer when full.
4) A front-end that decodes the trace and presents it to
   the user in a comprehensive graphic or text way.
I have been working on this for more than 6 months now, and
I think now is the time to give it a public test. That is,
I would like to have feedback on the interest this tool
represents to you, the features you would like to see added
to it and the changes you think should be made.
The Linux Trace Toolkit can be found at the following address :

The above page contains more detail, screenshots, documentation
than a mail can carry ...
Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon!
