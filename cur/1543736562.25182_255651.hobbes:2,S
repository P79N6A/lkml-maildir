Looks like disk_stat_add in the sw-raid code. The proper fix is probably
to disable preempt around those regions - but just doing it the dumb
way (ie. in the driver code) looks like an unfortunate layering violation.
Maybe something like disk_stat_update_start / disk_stat_update_end that
gives you the per-cpu stat pointer as a "token" to be used by
disk_stat_inc/add/etc. Anyone?
Named slightly differently, so you keep backward compatibility, of course.
