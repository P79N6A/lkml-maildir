Of course.
And I do still need to check what other bits and pieces of hardware, if any, 
may want to make use of that particular interrupt. Given that I'm trying to 
get this to run on a very specific system (a Hurricane LX-800), the simple 
solution may very well work locally.
In fact, it may even be a good first problem-solving step for the vanilla 
kernel, if only to quickly mark the driver as "known bad with shared irqs" to 
possibly save someone else from having to perform a debugging session. The 
full fix can then happen later.

Which does nicely illustrate the value of running a debugging-enabled kernel 
during development. Random OOPSen out in the field == ouch. Much pain was saved 
this time around.
