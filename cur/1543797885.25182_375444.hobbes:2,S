OK, I've changed my code that way. Thanks for the hint.

I don't mind the extra expense if it helps spotting race conditions. I
just wanted to make sure we agreed that doing so would simply change
the nature of the error we'll get if such a condition happens, but
won't actually prevent this error from happening. Unless each user of
the driver data has an explicit NULL check, which isn't the case for my
driver (and I *would* mind that extra expense.)
Now the question is, is there actually any race condition there? In my
case, the only users of the driver data are the sysfs callback
functions, so I guess that this is all down to whether the driver core
will unregister them before platform_driver.remove is called, or after
it is called. If .remove is called first, then yes my code is racy and
I'll have to fix it.
Thanks,
