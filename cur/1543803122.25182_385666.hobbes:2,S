 thanks.
I see, I'll care about it.

I'll care about it too.

This patch series fixes the following problems on 32 bits architecture.
 o  stat64 returns the lower 32 bits of blocks, although userland
    st_blocks has 64 bits, because i_blocks has only 32 bits.
    The ioctl with FIOQSIZE has the same problem.
 o  As Dave Kleikamp said, making >2TB file on JFS results in writing
    an invalid block number to disk inode.  The cause is the same as
    above too.
 o  In generic quota code dquot_transfer(), the file usage is calculated
    from i_blocks via inode_get_bytes().  If the file is over 2TB,
    the change of usage is less than expected.  The cause is the
    same as above too.
 o  As Trond Myklebust said, statfs64's entries related to blocks are
    invalid on statfs64 for a network filesystem which has more than
    2^32-1 blocks with CONFIG_LBD disabled. [PATCH 3/3]
