Ok.

already does.

don't need it/already done in the frame buffer.
You CAN also look at the GGI project (
http://www.ggi-project.org/
)
They have an interesting approach (only slightly superseded by the
framebuffer driver) - They are/were looking at dividing the graphics
resource into its' components. Clock drivers, video registers drivers, GPU
interface drivers, graphic event queue driver. Last time I was looking
(shortly after the framebuffer introduction) they wanted to be able to mix
and match the components to the actual devices on the video board (since
many of them use the same fundamental components) and eliminate the "one
driver one video device" aspect.
It may even be suitable for embeded devices... though I think they kinda
got too large since then.
They also support X.

Not unhappy, it just indicated a bit of experience lacking.
