Humm, maybe I missunderstand you:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc2-nf2]# objdump -d 
</boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8-rc2-nf2>.o >file.objdump
objdump: a.out: No such file or directory
So I grepped to locate dcache.o (its in the fs subdir) but its still 
an error:
----------------
[root@coyote fs]# objdump -d <dcache.o >file.objdump
objdump: a.out: No such file or directory
------------------
and it (dcache.o) does exist.  What am I doing wrong?
