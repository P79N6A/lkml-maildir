In bio_add_page(), there is this check:
	/*
	 * if queue has other restrictions (eg varying max sector size
	 * depending on offset), it can specify a merge_bvec_fn in the
	 * queue to get further control
	 */
	if (q->merge_bvec_fn) {
		/*
		 * merge_bvec_fn() returns number of bytes it can accept
		 * at this offset
		 */
		if (q->merge_bvec_fn(q, bio, bvec) < len) {
			bvec->bv_page = NULL;
			bvec->bv_len = 0;
			bvec->bv_offset = 0;
			return 0;
		}
	}
The packet writing code has the restriction that a bio must not span a
packet boundary. (A packet is 32*2048 bytes.) If the page when mapped
to disk starts 2kb before a packet boundary, merge_bvec_fn therefore
returns 2048, which is less than len, which is 4096 if the whole page
is mapped, so the bio_add_page() call fails.
I don't think this case ever happens with the standard kernel, because
it doesn't (afaik) contain any merge_bvec_fn implementations that are
as restrictive as the one in the cdrw packet writing code. I still
think the code in mpage_writepage() is wrong, even if it happens to
work in the standard kernel.

I didn't make any exact measurements, but it looked like the pageout
code didn't throw enough parallel bios at the packet writing request
queue, so a lot of incomplete packets had to be written to disk. This
is very costly, because the code then has to do read/modify/write
cycles instead of just writing the whole packet directly.
A rough guess is that 2kb block size was 2-3 times slower than 4kb
block size, but I'll make more tests later to see what's really going
on here.
