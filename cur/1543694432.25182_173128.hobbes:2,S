I was coming to this conclusion too...  still, it's safer simply to 
handle collisions.

Consider a simple key-value map, where "$hash $n" is the key and the 
value is the block of data.  Only three operations need occur:
* if hash exists (highly unlikely!), read and compare w/ raw data
* write new block to disk
* add single datum to key-value index
Inode block lists would need to be updated regardless of any collision; 
that would be a standard and required part of any VFS interaction. And 
the internal workings of the key-value index (think Berkeley DB) are 
static, regardless of any collision.
