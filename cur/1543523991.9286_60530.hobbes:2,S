Oh, _analogue_ mixing...  I hadn't realised.
To rephrase: when there is no path through the mixer from any source,
then turn it off.  And when a source isn't playing, don't count it.
That turns it off when nobody is using the appropriate part of /dev/dsp.

Well that's ok then, with the notifier the combined driver + mixer will
do whacky things.  I'm sure the user experience will be of similar
quality, i.e. you get sound or you don't get sound after a resume.
If it's wrong, user loads player app and clicks "Stop" or "Play" as
preferred.  From there, everything works again.
If there's anything more difficult going on, it's something the CD
driver should be attempting to correct, perhaps by resetting the drive
after a power status change.
have a nice day,
