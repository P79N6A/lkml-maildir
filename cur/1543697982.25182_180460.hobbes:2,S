   I used to use:
    char buf[MAX];
     ...
    buf[MAX-1] = 0; /* zero terminate */
    strncpy(buf, src, MAX-1);
   This is safe regarding both 0 termination and 0 padding rest of string.

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
