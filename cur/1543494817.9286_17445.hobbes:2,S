Hi,
I mailed to the list last week describing "out of memory" problem.
Accoring to sysreq-alt-m, it seems that network buffer allocations
takes 130,000,000 or more buffers. This situation is "normal" here with
using 2.2.7 ;-( But I recently discovered that our main server (running
Linux 2.2.6 UP) must be rebooted in average every weeks because of similar
problem. Is there any idea   ?        
Thanx : Gabor,
