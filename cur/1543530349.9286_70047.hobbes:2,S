Hmmmm.  No.

He appears almost daily on the various NIC lists.

(pardons to the USB crew to use you :) How much USB development is actually
talked about on l-k?  There's a fairly steep ratio between linux-kernel and
linux-usb.
There is discussion and it filters quite quickly from l-k to l-t.

And it is Donald's NIC drivers.  ...a LOT of them.

Why do you choose to ignore the linux-tulip list where the work happens?

The months of broken drivers are because the powers that be chose not to
allow the current code to be brought into the tree because it had changed too
much.  This wasn't any fault of Donald.  Anyone is free to update the incore
version to match the developer's version.  It happens all the time.

Well, I'd be pretty irritated when the kernel version keeps getting hacked
left and right to fix one thing which breaks another and none of it reported
directly back to the developer.  How much of your changes have you posted to
him?

Or you end up with tulip drivers that work for you but break on three
different things for me.

Well, his driver worked for me, reliably.  Double or not.  I'd rather have
the double alloc mem than have a driver that is totally broken.

Why is it then that Donald's drivers always seem to work more than the driver
in the kernel?  A bug pops up and is reported on linux-tulip and we get a
fix.  A bug pops up on l-k and two months later we still have the same
version in the kernel.  Repeated gripes about it being broken don't get us
very far.
