So you change it to 2... but what about the "float" type? It gets
a mixture of 64-bit and 32-bit IEEE arithmetic depending rather
unpredictably on compiler register allocations and optimizations???
If a "float" will have excess precision, then a "double" might
as well have it too. Usually it helps, but sometimes it hurts.
This is life with C on x86.

Ugh, more start-up crud.
