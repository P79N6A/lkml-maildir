Thanks for all suggestions.  I tried passing mem=2048m to the kernel. 
This is with 2.6.16.13.  This did fix the USB ehci problem.  Of course
the kernel only sees half of my RAM, so this is not a satisfactory
long-term workaround.
As for your other suggestions, I'm not sure how to implement those. 
I'm not a kernel developer.  If you can give me more specific
instructions or send me a patch I would be happy to try those out. 
Otherwise, if you feel that this is unrelated to the other entries in
bugzilla with similar symptoms, I would be happy to submit a bug
report.
