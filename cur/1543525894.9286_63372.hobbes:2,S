Then what? You can forcibly kill processes which access no more
existent files, if these files are on a removable media.
Moreover, this situation is not very different from
opening a file on disk and deleting it in another window. The only
difference is that it'd be killed if the media is gone.

No, you cannot do the following with autofs:
- insert a CDROM, floppy, whatever
- "click on the icon"
- remove the media
- insert another one
- "click refresh"
Yes, that's newbie stuff, and thus, all newbies would benefit from
this. Dumb users, if you wish. And they are by far the most numerous.

If well implemented, it needs no bad press, nor it needs press at all.

See above.

And it has a simple solution: a forcible kill. After all, it's the
users's fault in this case. You know which processes use a file, if
this file doesn't exist *and* the device is "sloppy-mounted" and not 
here -> SIGKILL.

It still does not answer my question of what misses in the kernel to
do that... Moreover your solution would require that the media report
media status change. There's AIN for CDROMs, but what for IDE floppies
and the like? Moreover, IDE floppies have no CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl
right now (I have a patch for that BTW).
