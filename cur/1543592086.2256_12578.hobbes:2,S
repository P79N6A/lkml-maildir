The current partitioning code consists of re-reading from disk. That is 
code that has to be present anyway even without an initrd since it is needed
for mounting other filesystems

Thats the kind of LVM layer I am thinking in terms of, not a large block
of LVM code. And for that matter the partition scanner and modifying code
can even be seperate dynamic loaded modules.
At the moment ponder what happens if you have I/Os in flight to /dev/hda3
when you delete /dev/hda2
