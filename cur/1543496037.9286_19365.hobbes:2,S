Is that missfeature of sh? I thought that it was race between sh being
loaded and potential change of file. Malicious user could delete suid
program and replace it with his own code with other name -- that is
not easily worked around. So capabilities support will have to go into
sperl, anyway.
Anyway, suid is currently not honoured by scripts. It will take
_years_ before we'll get all tools like tar, cp, nfs, etc. work right
with capbilities-in-namespace. By putting capabilities in name space
you have to teach admins about new dangers: there are priviledged
executables which have raised priviledges. These are all changes that
are probably good thing - in distant future. But I think that we want
something before that distant feature - and for common case (elf
executables) solution is not that hard.
It may show that elf capabilities will be nice even when we have
filesystem support: they have nice property of being able to travel
across other unixes unharmed.
Did I convince you now?
