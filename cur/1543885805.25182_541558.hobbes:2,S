Actually, it does take this path ... one of the things we've been doing
in SCSI is slowly eliminating the old direct submission paths in favour
of sending everything through the correct block layer paths.
scsi_execute(), which the sr ioctl uses is just such a fixed path ...
the bug is that it should be bouncing the request but because of an
oversight (which Mike's patch corrects) it doesn't.
The ultimate goal is to be able to eliminate the unchecked_isa_dma flag
entirely and have the block layer (or device mask allocations) fix all
of this in every ULD.
