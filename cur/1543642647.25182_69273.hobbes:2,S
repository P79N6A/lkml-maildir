Yeah, SciFi decided not to do a 5th season. They will finish season 4.
All fans enraged. Of you are a fan, please do the followings:
Sign the petition here:

Also, send snail mail to the addresses and calls and faxes to the
numbers mentioned here (snail mail has more impact than email, in these
cases):

Do it before friday !  They're going to destroy the set by then !
The scifi.com website was completely slashdotted all Saturday and Sunday
(i.e., flooded with people), and is still pretty bad. This is a good sign 
that the reaction is vehement.  I have already sent mail, email, and I've 
posted messages on the SciFi bulletin board.
If you're in the States, your mail will get to its destination a lot faster 
than mine, because the addresses mentioned on that Web site are in the States.
Please do this !
<sarcasm>Oh happy frelling day !</sarcasm>

You are my socket, my only socket,
you make me happy, when routers fray,
you'll never know how much I transferred,
please don't take my socket away.
