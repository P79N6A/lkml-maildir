Al, can you try a patch posted to linux-fsdevel and linux-ext4 from
Hisashi Hifumi <hifumi.hisashi@oss.ntt.co.jp> to see if this improves
your situation?  Dated Mon, 04 Feb 2008 19:15:25 +0900.
    [PATCH] ext3,4:fdatasync should skip metadata writeout when overwriting
It may be that we already have a solution in that patch for database
workloads where the pages are already allocated by avoiding the need
for ordered mode journal flushing in that case.
Cheers, Andreas
