Agreed.  Further, embedded routers - since they are headless/diskless -
have problems even with the _current_ /dev/random code.  They simply do
not generate enough entropy to fulfill sshd requests [1].
Saying "use /dev/urandom" in this case means we may as well not have a
/dev/random.  There is a difference between incorrect accounting (which
it seems you have identified) and just too strict gathering behavior.

[1] this is why I wrote my netdev-random patches.  some machines just
    have to take the entropy from the network card... there is nothing
    else.
