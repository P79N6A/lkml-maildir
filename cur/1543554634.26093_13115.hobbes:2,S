I have been using (a heavily patched) 2.4.0test9 since it was released
and have not seen any problems that I can recall.  Booted (vanilla)
2.4.0test11pre5 a moment ago, but after
	insmod ipchains.o
	rsh foo
	ping bar
the machine was completely dead immediately -
no ping/console change/.., no log messages -
a real ping of death.
(This machine would forward from foo to bar. This happened
while copying a disk to another disk using dd.)
