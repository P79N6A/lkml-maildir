I think checking for NULL should be the first thing a caller of these
interfaces should do.  So from that perspective, I don't think putting
anything in *lenp makes sense.  It's value is undefined.
In fact since we'll leave *lenp alone if the property doesn't exist,
you can initialize it to -1 if you want to simplify your checks.
