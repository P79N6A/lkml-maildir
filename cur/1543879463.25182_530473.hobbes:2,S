Well, it looks like someone allocated about 6000 pages after we had freed
enough memory for suspending.
I suspect one of the device drivers plays some dirty tricks in its .suspend()
routine.  Now the question is which one.
I wonder if setting PAGES_FOR_IO in include/linux/suspend.h to eg. 8192 will
help.

Yes, and this seems to be related to the APIC.
Gautham, can you please tell me who's the right person to ask about it?
