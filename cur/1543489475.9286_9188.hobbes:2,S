I have one computer that is loaded with ISA cards (modem, isdn, scsi,
sound) and PCI (vga+tv, ethernet). Two of the ISA cards are PnP (and
that's more than the average). 
I'm using isapnptools and I'm happy with it. All the above devices
are usable in Linux (all at the same time). I cannon say that about
other OS that claim to support PnP (pronounced "Plug and Pray").
I am aware that isapnp has some limitations. First it is far
from being user friendly. A nice GUI wrapper would be nice for
new users.
The other problem is that the devices that it supports must be
loaded as modules (same thing applies to kernel isapnp tools that
need to interact with a userland daemon). In the (rare ?) cases
of isapnp boot devices, initrd can be used.
