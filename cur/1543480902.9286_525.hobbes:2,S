a customer wants a seriously fast machine
so does anyone know of an available quad xeon motherboard?
the emphasis is on motherboard, not built system
also, does the board require s special enclosure?
or is there another way of skinning this cat (disk?)
before this descends into a pissing contest between various
architectures, let me say that my own system is an alpha PC164LX
so i'm not religious about Pentium; just speed
