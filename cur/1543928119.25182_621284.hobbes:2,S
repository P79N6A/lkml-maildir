It's not the SATA subsystem itself that is experimental.
There are some some drivers that are still experimental.
That's the same like e.g. with network drivers where the subsystem is 
stable but some drivers are not (yet).
And therefore people are forced to enable CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL for 
getting the kernel running on their hardware.
But e.g. the fact that a user must enable an experimental SATA driver 
does not imply he also wants experimental network subsystem features.
