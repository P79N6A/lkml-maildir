OK, so the problem is that get_vm_area allocates the vm_area with an 
extra page added as a guard page.  iounmap uses p->size directly, 
without taking the guard page into account.
I don't see why this doesn't cause more problems.  I guess uncached 
iomappings are not used that much?
Anyway, I think this is the right fix:
Subject: fix iounmap's use of vm_struct's size field
get_vm_area always returns an area with an adjacent guard page.  That
guard page is included in vm_struct.size.  iounmap uses vm_struct.size
to determine how much address space needs to have change_page_attr
applied to it, which will BUG if applied to the guard page.
This patch adds a helper function - get_vm_area_size() in
linux/vmalloc.h - to return the actual size of a vm area, and uses it
to make iounmap do the right thing.  There are probably other places
which should be using get_vm_area_size().
Thanks to Dave Young <hidave.darkstar@gmail.com> for debugging the
problem.
