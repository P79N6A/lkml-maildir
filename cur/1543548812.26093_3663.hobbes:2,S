"TRG hereby offers to SGI Corporation exclusive, unlimimited, perpetual,
transferable, licensee rights to the Linux port of the MANOS debugger
and upon TRG posting this debugger code to the Linux community, agrees
to grant to SGI the rights to maintain and create derivative works from
the MANOS Debugger source code, and the right to place SGI's Copyright
notices on this code.  In exchange for these rights, SGI will be
required to accept support costs for maintaining the MANOS debugger, and
will provide Keith Owens or another representative of it's election
reasonable consulting fees for a period of five (5) years to maintain
this source base for the Linux Operating System.   TRG reserves all
other rights."
Since SGI has recognized the need for good debugging technology in
Linux, and has shown a willingness to fund something that makes
everyone's life easier, TRG would be willing to contribute to SGI's
demonstrated leadership in this area.
TRG's plans are to focus on MANOS once the Linux merge is completed, and
we will post the MANOS debugger for Linux, but we would really like to
see a commercial company like SGI carry on supporting it on Linux.  I
can do some of it, but I think having a "kernel debugger source" for the
industry like SGI who wants to fund and promote kernel debugging tools
would make more sense and as Keith pointed out, centralize changes and
features.
