Sorry, I mis explained it, I haven't taken that much of a leave of 
my senses , at least I don't think so.
The card has auto support in hardware for those options, outside of
the uart. Options 2/3 you can obviously implement this way  with 
ioctl( TIOCMBIS/TIOCMBIC and friends) but in this card you need to 
enable that option first anyway.
This mean  we have three options as I see it.
	1) Chose one, and that what linux supports, 
	     then do ostrich impression
	2) (1a really) Chose one mode as default make userspace 
             bang the h/w directly to change it.
	3) Add a (new?) ioctl to change it. Define a default.
Does this explain it better?

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
