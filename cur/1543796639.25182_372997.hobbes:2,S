Please stop beeing a freaking jackass.  There are various projects using
the current code.  It's not perfect but people are working on it.  And Joseph &
friends are writing a module to support softmac cards in that framework,
which is one of the most urgently needed things right now, because all the
existing softmac frameworks don't work with that code.
And please stop your stupid devicespace advertisements.  If you think the
code is so useful why don't you send patches to integrate it with the
currently existing wireless code (after cleaning up the horrible mess
it is currently)?
