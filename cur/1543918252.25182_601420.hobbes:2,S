Please take a closer look at my partition_sched_domains() and its
interface to the scheduler.
You should recognize this API, once you look at it.  It simply passes
the full flat, hard partition, in its entirety.  This is the
partitioning that you speak of, I believe.  It's here; just not where
you expected it.
The portion of the code that is in kernel/sched.c is just a little bit
of optimization.  It avoids rebuilding all the sched domains and
reattaching every task to its sched domain; rather it determines which
sched domains were added or removed and just rebuilds them.
Once you take a closer look, I hope you will agree that this new
interface between the cpuset and sched code provides a cleaner
separation.
