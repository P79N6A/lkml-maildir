Good questions! They are very important and also my concern now.

The current driver just looks two mport as two independent fabrics.
We can add bridge driver to implement your idea.

That's a terrible thing in the current driver. Two mports get the same
 ID in one fabric. About the port bound, it's a good idea, I also need
 a new driver to support it.
In fact, our first mission is to make the RapidIO driver ported from ppc
to powerpc can
 be compiled and run. Fortunately, there is no more than one port in
processor now,
 we have time to implement it.

A choice is add ID option into dts node. I have some ideas about RapidIO
 driver in u-boot. U-boot can assign ID in dts and tell kernel.

It seems the address pair is a must-be selection as pci bus.
But now, no connection between ports. Every operations in only
 in its own port view.

A good nose! Thanks! :)
