Given that it has just become easy to replicate, I suspect that it will
get fixed by someone looking at the recent changes. Agreed, a perfect fix
may wait, but when preempt fails regularly and SMP works, as described in
posts and by some mail, I don't think a rewrite is needed, just one or a
few locks.
My guess only.
