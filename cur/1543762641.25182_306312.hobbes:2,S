Yes.  The drivers that use it just need visiting with a big hammer.
However, our character ULDs (st and sg) use it because they try to
simulate fire and forget in the async write path (That's the only time
you actually don't wait on completion for scsi_do_req).
This comes about because the mid-layer is block oriented, so you can't
use any of the read/write machinery.  We could fix this by having a
generic character tap to a block queue for use in cases like SCSI where
the underlying driver uses block queues even if the actual device isn't
a block device.
Essentially, the character tap would simply submit a stream of reads and
writes through the block queue.  Then we could modify st and sg to use
an identical framework to the other ULDs ... you get a setup API and a
returning command API which are called for every I/O and the block layer
gets to handle the async/not-async pieces.
