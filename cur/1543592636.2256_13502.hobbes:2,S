I did the same thing in my directory indexing patch, but with a much 
larger buffer: 2728 bytes.  I traced the path from the syscall and all 
the paths out as well.  I did cause a stack overflow with this because 
gcc took the union of two such allocations in different control blocks 
instead of the intersection, much to my surprise.  This was cured by 
using fancier code to eliminate one of the allocations.  Al since broke 
this out into a separate function, making it more obviously safe, but 
note: it has to be broken out further so that there are no complex 
trees of calls descending from the stack storage pig.
This call appends a new block to a file then splits the contents of 
some other block into the new block using some workspace on the stack. 
The block has to be appended outside the function, otherwise the big 
stack allocation gets carried arbitrarily far through the kernel (think 
recursive allocation).  Similarly for mark_buffer_dirty and just to be 
safe, brelse as well.  Mark_buffer_dirty didn't use to have a big hairy 
call chain attached to it but it does now.   Even lowly brelse might 
evolve this way without warning.  The only safe thing to do is avoid 
all calls outside the subystem and comment the others.
My question: assuming the entire call chain is documented, exactly how 
much of the 8K kernel stack is safe to use?
