It is production.  This week these systems go to 2.4.21-ac4 with the
2.8.0 i2c.  I only think it's not a straight up kernel bug because there
are 35ish identicle systems running all the same software with 0
problems.  In addition for some odd reason this one machine was giving
some very odd temp readings.
Thus spake Zwane Mwaikambo (zwane@arm.linux.org.uk):
