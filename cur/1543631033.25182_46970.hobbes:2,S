I was gonna suggest the same thing. Why not just have a simple event server 
based on unix sockets.
This server would listen on unix stream socket. Clients interested in 
events would connect to it.
All the server has to do is copy event to all connected clients.
Server code is very simple. About 20 lines, everything in a single thread, 
if you use GLib's event loop.
