You might as well have said "the moon is made out of cheese" and i'd not 
have quoted it either. Why? Because it's irrelevant to the fundamental 
point that was raised and which you keep ignoring: that the only 
"example" you cited is a hypothetical that is currently false. In any 
case, speculation about what Sun might or might not do, up until the 
point it actually does it, is not something i feel compelled to do 
anything over, so please stop wasting my time by Cc:-ing me. Thanks,
	Ingo
