Well, that's kinda silly to have two different approaches. If the
consensus is to keep net/ and drivers/net/, why not just have sound/ and
drivers/sound/ too?
It is not a big stretch to grab sound/ and drivers/sound/ over just
sound/ and certainly the proposal of having a subsys/ directory is
essentially a rename of drivers/ to subsys/.
so....
net/
sound/
drivers/net/
drivers/sound/
The drivers subdir structure closely follows what happens one level up.
Not a problem and maintains the status quo. QED.
