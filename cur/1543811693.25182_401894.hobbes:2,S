In theory the bit offset could be from -2**31 to 2**31 - 1

This seems to work but causes more problems than it solves:
#define vaddr ((volatile long *) addr)
static inline void set_bit(int nr, volatile unsigned long * addr)
{
        __asm__ __volatile__( "lock ; "
                "btsl %2,%1"
                :"+m" (*(vaddr + (nr>>5)))
                :"m" (*vaddr),"Ir" (nr)
                );
}
First, it generates the byte offset nr>>5 and puts it in a register
even though it will never be used in the asm.  I can't find a constraint
that says "I'll be accessing this address but I don't need you to generate
it for me."  Second, the compiler thinks *vaddr will be read when it
really won't (unless nr>>5 == 0 in which case constraint 0 takes care
of it.)
Generated code when nr is a variable:
        movl nr,%edx
        movl %edx,%eax
        sarl $5,%eax
        sall $2,%eax
        lock ; btsl %edx,addr
This causes a register reload afterward (assuming all regs are busy) and
can cause a function to use more stack space.  That plus the three extra
instructions made me go with the full memory clobber instead.
