Indeed it is (as well as <linux/stat.h>).
I believe the use of feature macros is probably the way to go; that way 
userspace can request subsets, which can vary from libc to libc.
There is, of course, the "ABI language" variant, but I don't see that 
happening unless someone has a lot of time to spend on it.
