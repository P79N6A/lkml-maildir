I only saw fragments of the original patch -- could you be just
a bit more specific?
If you're suggesting adding some "struct list_head" into
"struct urb" for exclusive use of the interface's driver
(instead of urb_list, which is for usbcore/hcd) ... I'd
agree that'd be a good thing.
In fact I recently got around to adding that to the
"gadget side" analogue of an URB.  For much the same
kind of reasons as you mentioned.
