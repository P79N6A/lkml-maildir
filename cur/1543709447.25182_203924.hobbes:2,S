What do you mean by "reflected"?  That the NMi is delivered to both
siblings but only appears in /proc/interrupts as being delivered to the
zeroeth?

nmi_watchdog=2 is local apic, and nmi_watchdog=1 is I/O apic, is that
correct?
I am showing the current behaviour:
nmi_watchdog=1: 1000 NMI/second, accounted to both siblings
nmi_watchdog=2: one NMI/second, accounted to sibling 0 only.
with your patch:
nmi_watchdog=1: 1000 NMI/second, accounted to both siblings
nmi_watchdog=2: 1000 NMI/second, accounted to both siblings
All of these are wrong, aren't they?  We'd like to see one NMI per second,
on all siblings.  I gues that's not possible for the IO APIC?
From the above it appears that you have a solution planned for the local
APIC at least, yes?
