Hmm, good question, I hadn't considered this.  One option is to just limit
rec_len to 32768 or less (16k, 8k, 4k?), and require that there be multiple
such records in a directory block.  We could additionally require that the
records don't span such a boundary, which would potentially make it easier
to validate broken entries themselves, but would slightly hurt the case
where there are many large filenames.
I suppose the reason this wasn't hit during previous 64kB block testing is
that this has always been tested in relation to IO performance and not with
metadata, so the directories were probably all single-block dirs with a
"." and ".." entry at the beginning and a 65512-byte rec_len for the rest.
Cheers, Andreas
