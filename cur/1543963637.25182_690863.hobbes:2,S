+Kernel driver ibmaem
+======================
+
+Supported systems:
+  * Any recent IBM System X server with Active Energy Manager support.
+    This includes the x3350, x3550, x3650, x3655, x3755, x3850 M2,
+    x3950 M2, and certain HS2x/LS2x/QS2x blades.  The IPMI host interface
+    driver ("ipmi-si") needs to be loaded for this driver to do anything.
+    Prefix: 'ibmaem'
+    Datasheet: Not available
+
+Author: Darrick J. Wong
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+This driver implements sensor reading support for the energy and power
+meters available on various IBM System X hardware through the BMC.  All
+sensor banks will be exported as platform devices; this driver can talk
+to both v1 and v2 interfaces.  This driver is completely separate from the
+older ibmpex driver.
+
+The v1 AEM interface has a simple set of features to monitor energy use.
+There is a register that displays an estimate of raw energy consumption
+since the last BMC reset, and a power sensor that returns average power
+use over a configurable interval.
+
+The v2 AEM interface is a bit more sophisticated, being able to present
+a wider range of energy and power use registers, the power cap as
+set by the AEM software, and temperature sensors.
+
+Special Features
+----------------
+
+The "power_cap" value displays the current system power cap, as set by
+the Active Energy Manager software.  Setting the power cap from the host
+is not currently supported.
