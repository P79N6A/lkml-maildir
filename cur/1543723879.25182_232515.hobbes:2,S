ah, OK.  The original idr.c code had a (weird) feature in which each time
you add a new element, idr_add_new() returns a generation counter in the
top bits of the returned index.  So when doing a lookup the idr code would
mask the counter bits off the index before using it.
This was so that if someone did a quick add/remove/add, the second `add'
would return the same index, with a different counter in te top eight bits.
When you do another lookup you can compare the counter which you imbedded
in the object with the counter in the index which you used for the lookup. 
If they're different, you know that someone has deleted the object you were
looking for.
It was, IMO, sorry, a complete crock and was all thrown away a month or so
ago.

The comment is stale - I'll remove it.
