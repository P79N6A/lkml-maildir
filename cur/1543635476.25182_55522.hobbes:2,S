While I understand the possible value, are printk translations
really important enough to justify?
Do we really need to have the equivalent of:
	printk(tr("Context string %s: %d"),tr("some string"),value);
translate/lookups?  Why?  If so, is this facility supposed to be
run-time or compile-time?
Unfortunately, I missed the RAS BOF at OLS, so I don't know
what was discussed.  Some of these were audio recorded.
Anyone know of the audio repository location?  Can't find any of
the 2001 or 2002 sessions on the symposium website.

to schedule a discussion with some IBM folks about part of this
