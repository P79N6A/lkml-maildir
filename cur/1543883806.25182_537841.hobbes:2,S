I did the upgrade last night.  Drive performance was SLLOOWW.  When it 
came time to the reboot, I had a corrupted disk.  (Not certain if that was 
the fault of the upgrade.  I have to finish the fsck repairs first.) And 
this is with ext3.  Not good.
I have been seeing real bad driver performance on the latest FC6 kernel as 
well.
