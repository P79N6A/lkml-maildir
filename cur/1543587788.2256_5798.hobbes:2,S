I'm wondering if that veto business is really needed. Why not reject
*all* APM rejectable events, and then let the userspace event handler
send the system to sleep or turn it off? Anybody au fait with the APM
spec?
This would have the advantage that the veto stuff could be ripped out
and things made simpler.
