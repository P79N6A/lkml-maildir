Felix,
We do have utilities that make Netware file systems and fsck them on linux.
They will be posted mid-July.  They need a lot of cleanup yet and code
reviewing.  The fsck utility more so than the nwdisk utlitity for creating
file systems.  This project will probably have all the pieces pulled
together by fall and finalized for all Linux versions.  We are hoping
mid-summer, but looking at all the work and testing, it's going to go on for
awhile.
There are several excellent books on the NT file system, Some better titles
are,
Inside Windows NT, Second Edition, David Solomon
Windows NT File System Internals, Rajeev Nagar
And the best source is the Windows NT IFS Kit and the sources.  Be prepared
to delve into structured exception handling, NT FS's are heavily dependent
on it.  The unwind cases for handling raised exceptions are mind numbing, be
warned.
Jeff
