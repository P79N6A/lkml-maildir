My P4 box has the same "problem", which is remedied by..

..whacking the ancient last_tsc before entering test loop.  Question is,
is there a good reason to disable the TSC once it's been stepped upon by
BIOS?  Are there any ill effects to be awaited by ignoring this BIOS
artifact?  All seems just fine here.
