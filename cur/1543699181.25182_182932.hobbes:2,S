Hi,
There has also been an issue identified where HT will not be detected
correctly with 2.4.23 unless you apply a patch or set your number of CPUs to
8 instead of 2...
Please try the patch at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/current-updates/linux-2.4.23-updates.patch
as it contains this as well as other fixes.
Regards
James
