You have to know the dependancies for the entire system, its nearly
impossible to do. Once you have the apps also waiting for each other and
for direct communications (eg via a database or a shared service) life
gets fun. 
For local apps one thing that has been suggested and some microkernels
have played with is a syscall that basically is "send this message and
donate the rest of my timeslice to.."
