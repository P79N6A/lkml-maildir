    i'm running a vanilla 2.6.1-kernel, without any additional patches.
    you're right about the message, showkey is exiting after 10s, even
    if i keep one of the 'problematic' keys pressed..
Yes, I see. Looking at 2.6.1 things are a bit different again,
but raw mode is very broken. Instead of reporting what the
keyboard sends, as raw mode is supposed to do, the scancode
is first converted to a keycode, and in the case of an unknown
scancode it is then just thrown away. In raw mode the keycode
is later translated back to a scancode (using a correspondence
that is not 1-1), but in your case we never get that far.
Did you try using setkeycodes? Say
# setkeycodes 91 120 92 121
to map scancode 0x91 to keycode 120 and 0x92 to 121.
