??  There's been no change to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited().  I merely
widened the interface a bit: introduced the new
balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr() and did
static inline void
balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited(struct address_space *mapping)
{
	balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr(mapping, 1);
}
That being said, if reiserfs has `number of pages' in hand then yes, it
makes sense to migrate over to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr().

No, I wouldn't expect it to make much difference.
All that gunk is there just to avoid calling the expensive
get_writeback_state() once per set_page_dirty().
Inaccuracy here will introduce the possibility that we'll transiently dirty
more memory than dirty_ratio permits, but it'll only be a little bit (eight
times the amount of memory which is dirtied per balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited()
call).
That's a small amount of memory.  But if you have 1000 filesystems mounted
and they all do the same thing at the same time, things could get a bit
sticky.  Your patch will (greatly) reduce the possibility of even that
scenario.
