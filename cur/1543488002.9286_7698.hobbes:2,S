If you write-lock on waitqueue-lock, then you will release the lock and
try again. A write lock will never wait with the lock held, so the other
CPU should not read-lock. See the write_lock(rw) implementation:
        asm volatile("\n1:\t" \
                     "lock ; btsl $31,%0\n\t" \
                     "jc 4f\n" \
                     "2:\ttestl $0x7fffffff,%0\n\t" \
                     "jne 3f\n" \
                     ".section .text.lock,\"ax\"\n" \
                     "3:\tlock ; btrl $31,%0\n" \
                     "4:\tcmp $0,%0\n\t" \
                     "jne 4b\n\t" \
                     "jmp 1b\n" \
                     ".previous" \
                     :"=m" (__dummy_lock(&(rw)->lock)))
Note how we release the lock at label 3.

I think you just overlooked the basic writelock implementation.
