	  Hi all,
I've been hitting the same error every time I try to compile bk current on
alpha, namely the linker can't do its job on .tmp_vmlinux1.
My compiler is "gcc version 3.2.3 (Debian)" (but I also tried with 3.3 and
2.95), same problem.
Here is the output:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
init/built-in.o(.text+0x12a8): In function `inflate_codes':
: relocation truncated to fit: BRADDR .init.text

make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Am I missing something? Is there a bk tree for Alpha (Jeff Garzik, in his
bk doc talks about one but it seems to be dead)?
