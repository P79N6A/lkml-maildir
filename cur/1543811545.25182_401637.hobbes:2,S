Am i just tired from trying to make XSLT to do something unnatural or is
there something odd going on in msi.c?
static void msi_set_mask_bit(unsigned int vector, int flag)
{
        struct msi_desc *entry;
        entry = (struct msi_desc *)msi_desc[vector];
        if (!entry || !entry->dev || !entry->mask_base)
                return;
        switch (entry->msi_attrib.type) {
        case PCI_CAP_ID_MSI:
        {
                int             pos;		<==
                u32             mask_bits;
                pos = (long)entry->mask_base;	<==
...
Doesn't that mean that we, a: read 64 bit from memory. b: save it in a
32 bit area?
(esp since it seems to be a address pointer, which could also be using
higher memory areas... but then i dunno what a void __iomem * is, but i
assume that it will be 64 bits here =))
