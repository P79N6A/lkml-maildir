Uhm, so you actually want to change entry.S lines like:
	movl %eax,EAX(%esp)		# save the return value
to:
	movl %eax,.LEAX(%esp)		# save the return value
?  That sounds seriously ugly.

Have you actually looked at offset.c ?  It works fine with a cross-compiler,
and so does the $(NM) and sed solution, I suspect.
