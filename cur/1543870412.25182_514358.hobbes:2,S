for apache I agree that the target box was maxed out, so if you only had a 
single core on your AMD64 box that would be about half, however the thttpd is 
only useing ~1 of the CPU's (OS overhead is useing just a smidge of the second, 
but overall the box is 45-48% idle
if the amount of ram is an issue then you are swapping in your tests (or at 
least throwing out cache that you need) and so would not be testing what you 
think you are.

same test retreiving a ~128b file the server never gets below 51% idle (so it's 
only useing one CPU)

again with >50% idle on the server box
also, ab appears to only use a single cpu so the fact that there are two on the 
client box should not make a difference.
I will reboot these boxes into a UP kernel if you think that this is still a 
significant difference. based on what I'm seeing I don't think it will make much 
of a difference (except for the apache test)
