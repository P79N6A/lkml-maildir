Stephen,
Thank you for your interests and comment.
I'm beginning to feel that you might be misunderstanding
my message. Let me explain.

"The idea":
If we let process to inherit the name of its ancestors (usualy starts
from /sbin/init), then Linux kernel will be able to know ancestors
for each process.
"Above examples" are:
examples of how we can distinguish the same /bin/bash processes.

What do you mean by "this" here?
I was not talking about MAC nor policy definitions.

The above three lines are not TOMOYO Linux plicy.

In your SELinux policy examples, someone must write down them.
To do that someone must know what will happen beforehands.
But if you use TOMOYO Linux, you'll get domain transition
information easily. The example of the result can be found here:
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/lxr/source/?v=policy-sample
(choose whatever distribution and open the link for
"domain_policy.txt")
For example, from 
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/lxr/source/centos4.4/domain_policy.txt?v=policy-sample#L4564
you will know:
/bin/cp which was invoked from
   /usr/bin/makewhatis which was invoked from
     /etc/cron.weekly/00-makewhatis.cron which was invoked from
       /usr/bin/run-parts which was invoked from
         /bin/bash which was invoked from
           /usr/sbin/crond
that /bin/cp process needs to
read /dev/null, /etc/selinux/config, /proc/filesystems, and
write /var/cache/man/whatis, and truncate /var/cache/man/whatis.
We implemnted the above mentioned idea and TOMOYO Linux is a
sample system which use distinguished process as a "domain".
In some sense it is a system analyzing tool.
Again, we intended to share the idea to people on the lkml.
MAC (TOMOYO Linux) is just a sample.
Any feedback will be appreciated.
