Therein lies the problem.  I (and probably others) will not look into the
source for the vmware modules precisely because it is not GPL'd and may
contaminate me against working on a project like freemware.  They may well
consider the techniques they use in their code a trade secret, and I don't
want to be in the middle of a legal war.

For all kernel developers, working on code that is not free (as in
freedom) is dangerous business, and the safest way to deal with it is to
treat it as a black box.
