Noah,
Lots of your questions are appropriate for kernelnewbies.org .
__init (with 2 underscores) is defined in the header file
  linux/include/linux/init.h
It marks a code (text) segment as being discardable after boot/init
for code that is not in a module (i.e., it is compiled into the
kernel boot image).
"1<<12" is C.  Take the value 1, shift it left 12 times (bits),
giving 0x1000.
