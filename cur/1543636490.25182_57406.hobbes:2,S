Okay then. When would it be useful? I read that it would be useful
in embedded systems, but everything that will ever run on embedded
systems is known at compile time, or is uploaded by something written
by an intelligent developer, so I don't think it's useful there. I
'do' embedded systems and have never encountered OOM.
I also read about some 'home users' not knowing how to set up
there systems. I don't think one CPU cycle should be wasted to
protect them, well maybe 10, but that's it.
I keep seeing the same thing about protecting root against fork and
malloc bombs and I get rather "malloc()" about it. All distributions
I have seen, so far, come with `gcc` and `make`. The kiddies can
crap all over their kernels at their heart's content. I don't think
Linux should be reduced to the lowest common denominator.
Cheers,
