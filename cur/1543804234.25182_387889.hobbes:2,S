Someone unnamed has suggested I submit a patch with these cleanups.
But I am  lazy git who hates to test code, and it looks like Paul
Mundt is in a position to actually test that whatever we end up
with still works.
So I intend to send in two totally untested patches shortly:
 1) some minor cleanups of these bitmap routines, and
 2) Mundt's > BITS_PER_LONG patch, more or less, on top of that.
Then perhaps Mundt could retest and fix what I broke, then send in a
final pair of patches for Andrew's consideration.
If this isn't such a hot idea, Mundt, holler, and we can work
something else out.
