hi
	Sorry for my poor English.
	I am upgrade my system to a Intel OEM machine:
	2x PIII 450
	512 MB
	Intel GX mainboard with aic7896 onboard scsi controler
	5x QUANTUM   Model: VIKING II 9.1WLS HD 
	Creative ES1371 PCI SoundCard.
	Those soundcard and HDs were working fine with my old
	PII 450 (Intel BX +NCR58xx) box.
	There is always scsi error message like 
	scsi1 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
	SCSI bus is being reset for host 1 channel 0.
	(scsi1:0:2:0) Performing Domain validation.
	(scsi1:0:2:0) Successfully completed Domain validation.
	(scsi1:0:2:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 31.
	(scsi1:0:2:0) Performing Domain validation.

	scsi1 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
	SCSI bus is being reset for host 1 channel 0.
	(scsi1:0:2:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 31.
	scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 312278, scsi1, channel 0, id

	(scsi1:0:6:0) Synchronous at 40.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 31.         
	and that time ,uptime display like 26,20,15,system dead lock.
	cant reboot.
	But I am sure my HD is good. I have update the aic7xxx from 
	5.1.17 to 5.1.18 ,but seems no use.
	And my ES1371 dont work now.
	During booting,the Kernel said found the es1371 card.
	But I cant play anything, my joystick dont work too.
	How can I do?
	Are 2.2.10 work fine with Intel GX chipsets?
