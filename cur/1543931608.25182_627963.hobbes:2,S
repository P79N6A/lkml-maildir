Ok.  My analysis here was wrong.  Currently pgprot_noncached and
ioremap_nocache are out of sync.  With ioremap_nocache only specifying
_PAGE_PCD and pgprot_noncached specifying _PAGE_PCD | _PAGE_PWT.
So I don't have a clue how someone could reprogram the mtrrs currently
and expect things to work.
...
If we bother to ask ioremap for memory that is not cached, the last
thing in the world we want is the MTRRs upgrading that to write combining.
So ioremap_nocache has been slightly buggy for ages.  ioremap_nocache
and PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE should get _PAGE_PWT added to their
definitions.
Could we please get a cleanup patch at the beginning of this patchset
or that comes before it that fixes ioremap_nocache on x86?
That will make us a lot more git-bisect safe.
