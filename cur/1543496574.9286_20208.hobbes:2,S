Isn't this in the FAQ ? 
Two tools that work excellent together, are bonsai and lxr (of
www.mozilla.org and lxr.linux.no respectively). Bonsai let you query and
browse CVS histories, and LXR let you cross-reference the files and every
function/variable. Check out the demo at lxr.linux.no for example
(indexing the latest kernels).
Both install as web scripts so you can use a normal browser from anywhere.
Bonsai might require some twiddling to get to work so try LXR first, it's
easy to configure (if you don't have a CVS tree not much point using
bonsai either).
