I've had similar problems here on an AOpen AK73Pro(A) motherboard.  Its a 
single-processor board based on KT133A, and since 2.4.3 haven't been able 
to get USB working on it at all.
Dug through the old USB-users mailing lists and tried a wide variety of 
things; "noapic", changing IRQs, PnP On/Off in the BIOS, but had no luck.  
Best I was able to discern was that the board is using MPS1.4 but has no 
option in the BIOS to switch it back to MPS1.1.
Would love to get it working so that I could finally get my Epson1200U 
scanner working again, but am out of things to try (any suggestions would 
be MORE than welcome).

Exactly the same error I'm getting here.  Doesn't matter whether its the 
USB scanner or printer that I plug in to the USB ports, I always end up 
getting that error.
