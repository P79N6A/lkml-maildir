Subject: [patch 3/6] kprobes: Align probe address.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: David Wilder <dwilder@us.ibm.com>
Running a probe on s390 with a probe address that is not 4 byte aligned
results in a Kernel BUG.  The problem is that the stura instruction used
by swap_instruction requires the destination address to be 4 byte aligned.
As stura only writes 4 bytes, aligning to the next 4 byte aligned address
results in the breakpoint instruction being stored past the probe address.
The fix is to align the address backward (to the previous 4 byte aligned
address) and writing the two byte breakpoint instruction in the appropriate
bytes.
