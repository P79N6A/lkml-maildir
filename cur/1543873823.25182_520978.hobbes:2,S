You have to do some sort of lookup anyway, and Andy seemed to have them
all folded into one.
Or are you trying to avoid this by going to back to the crud we had
in 2.4 where we pretend mem_map is one big array, indexed by pfn with
huge sparsely mapped holes in it?
Would be nice to work out (and document somewhere) what the pros and
cons of virtual memmap vs sparsemem were - ISTR one of the arguments
was extremely sparsely layed out machines, and you needed sparsemem
for that. But right now we have 3 solutions, which is not a good
situation.
