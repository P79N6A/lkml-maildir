Subject: [PATCH 1/7] lguest: documentation pt I: Preparation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/505

The netfilter code had very good documentation: the Netfilter Hacking
HOWTO.  Noone ever read it.
So this time I'm trying something different, using a bit of
Knuthiness.  Start with drivers/lguest/README.

+Welcome, friend reader, to lguest.
+
+Lguest is an adventure, with you, the reader, as Hero.  I can't think of many
+5000-line projects which offer both such capability and glimpses of future
+potential; it is an exciting time to be delving into the source!
+
+But be warned; this is an arduous journey of several hours or more!  And as we
+know, all true Heroes are driven by a Noble Goal.  Thus I offer a Beer (or
+equivalent) to anyone I meet who has completed this documentation.
+
+So get comfortable and keep your wits about you (both quick and humorous).
+Along your way to the Noble Goal, you will also gain masterly insight into
+lguest, and hypervisors and x86 virtualization in general.
+
+Our Quest is in seven parts: (best read with C highlighting turned on)
+
+I) Preparation
+	- In which our potential hero is flown quickly over the landscape for a
+	  taste of its scope.  Suitable for the armchair coders and other such
+	  persons of faint constitution.
+
+II) Guest
+	- Where we encounter the first tantalising wisps of code, and come to
+	  understand the details of the life of a Guest kernel.
+
+III) Drivers
+	- Whereby the Guest finds its voice and become useful, and our
+	  understanding of the Guest is completed.
+
+IV) Launcher
+	- Where we trace back to the creation of the Guest, and thus begin our
+	  understanding of the Host.
+
+V) Host
+	- Where we master the Host code, through a long and tortuous journey.
+	  Indeed, it is here that our hero is tested in the Bit of Despair.
+
+VI) Switcher
+	- Where our understanding of the intertwined nature of Guests and Hosts
+	  is completed.
+
+VII) Mastery
+	- Where our fully fledged hero grapples with the Great Question:
+	  "What next?"
+
+make Preparation!
+Rusty Russell.

+ * A hypervisor allows multiple Operating Systems to run on a single machine.
+ * To quote David Wheeler: "Any problem in computer science can be solved with
+ * another layer of indirection."
+ *
+ * We keep things simple in two ways.  First, we start with a normal Linux
+ * kernel and insert a module (lg.ko) which allows us to run other Linux
+ * kernels the same way we'd run processes.  We call the first kernel the Host,
+ * and the others the Guests.  The program which sets up and configures Guests
+ * (such as the example in Documentation/lguest/lguest.c) is called the
+ * Launcher.
+ *
+ * Secondly, we only run specially modified Guests, not normal kernels.  When
+ * you set CONFIG_LGUEST to 'y' or 'm', this automatically sets
+ * CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST=y, which compiles this file into the kernel so it knows
+ * how to be a Guest.  This means that you can use the same kernel you boot
+ * normally (ie. as a Host) as a Guest.
+ *
+ * These Guests know that they cannot do privileged operations, such as disable
+ * interrupts, and that they have to ask the Host to do such things explicitly.
+ * This file consists of all the replacements for such low-level native
+ * hardware operations: these special Guest versions call the Host.
+ *
+ * So how does the kernel know it's a Guest?  The Guest starts at a special
+ * entry point marked with a magic string, which sets up a few things then
+ * calls here.  We replace the native functions in "struct paravirt_ops"
+ * with our Guest versions, then boot like normal. :*/
