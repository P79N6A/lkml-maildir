If drop source compatibility with user space, you end up with
user/kernel API files referring to <asm/types.h> (at best).
That works fine but your suggestion to copy definitions into
applications is then ever more messy.  All the basic types (`u32' etc.)
are wrong.  So a straight cut and paste will not always work.
