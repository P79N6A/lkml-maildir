Subject: POSIX.4/POSIX.1b (real time timers): maintainer???

Hi,
I patched my 2.2.5 kernel with a patch found at
http://hegel.ittc.ukans.edu/projects/posix/time.html.
This patch was ment for kernel 2.1.43 and so I ended up inserting a lot
of code manually to get it to work.
The only thing which I can not find is the header file(s) to include for
userspace... I need some structs from siginfo.h, but this file is
impossible to include from user space... ask gcc or egcs :-)
What I need in userspace is:
    a clockid_t typedef
    a struct timespec
    a struct itimerspec
    some defines like CLOCK_REALTIME, SIGEV_SIGNAL, ....
So the question: is there a maintainer for the POSIX.4 or now POSIX.1b
stuff? Or somebody who nows how I should handle this code???
Could you please also CC answers to this mail, I do not know how long I
can manage so much mails from this list :-)
