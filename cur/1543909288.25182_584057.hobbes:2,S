The DMA allocator is NUMA unaware. This means it doesn't require multiple
dma zones per node, but is happy with a global one that can live somewhere
else outside the pgdat. I also removed PCP and other fanciness so it's
really quite independent and much simpler than the normal one.  It also
doesn't need try_to_free_pages() because in a isolated zone there
shouldn't be any freeable pages.
The big difference is that it can go into a slower than O(1) mode that tries
to find pages based on the DMA mask

There are still other architectures that use it. Biggest offender
is s390. I'll leave them to their respective maintainers.
It's not clear s390 really needs the mask allocator anyways.
e.g. I suspect they just need to put data into a specific 
range, but if there are no subranges then it might be
overkill.
