We might be talking past each other on this one.  If I am not getting
too confused, it is possible to configure a mainline kernel so that
the load cannot rise high enough to force softirqs into process
context.  Although looking at 2.6.15, it appears that this would
require rebuilding after hand-editing the value of MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART,
which some might feel too-brutal of tweaking to be considered mere
"configuration".
In any case, the key point of the comment is that synchronize_sched()
is not guaranteed to wait for all pending softirq handlers to complete.
Does the comment make that sufficiently clear?
						Thanx, Paul
