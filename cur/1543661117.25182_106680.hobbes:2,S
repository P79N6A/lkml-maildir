I was bitten by this when I built up gcc-3.2.1.
In earlier gcc's you could have
	ln -s /usr/local/gcc-3.0/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc
and it would all work OK.
But in recent gcc's, that does not work.  You actually have to add
/usr/local/gcc-3.2.1/bin to your $PATH, and execute gcc from there.
The problem also goes away when you remove -notsdinc from the kernel
makefiles.  So it seems that something changed in the way in which gcc
locates the compiler-provided headers.
In short: check your compiler setup.
