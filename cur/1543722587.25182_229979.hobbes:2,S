What is the problem again, can't the driver us the dynamic pci mapping
API which does allow more memory to be mapped even on crippled machines
without iommu ?
And isn't this a problem that will vanish since PCI Express and PCI X
both *require* support for 64 bit addressing, so all higher speed cards
are going to be ok in principle ?
