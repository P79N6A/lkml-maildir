And a difference of memory architecture is there tooo. x86_64 in
64-bit mode implements flat memory model but IA32 uses
segmentation/paging. As far as Linux Kernel is concern I know kernel
won't implements segmentation in IA32 so it memory management is
almost compatible with x86_64 except registers/real address /virtual
addresses ...

Nops, I am not interested in x86_64 context of intel and amd, I rather
wanted a comparison between the intel and amd server processors
architecture (Itanium and Opteron).
Any ways, Thanks
