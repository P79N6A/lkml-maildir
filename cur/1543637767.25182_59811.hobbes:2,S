Subject: Patch?: initial ramdisks did not work in 2.5.28-29
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Initial ramdisks do not work in linux-2.5.2{8,9}, because
fs/block_dev.c in these kernels has a new version of bd_open()
that does not set bdev->bd_inode->i_size when bdev->bd_openers is
non-zero.
	I would appreciate information on whether this change in
bd_open's behavior is intended.  If it is, then the following
patch makes updates the ramdisk driver to work again.
	Also, I would appreciate knowing if anyone is acting as
maintainer for drivers/block/rd.c, or if I should just send
patches for rd.c directly to Linus if nobody complains on
the linux-kernel mailing list.  I have some other minor patches for rd.c
to reduce its use of minor device numbers, and a patch that someone
whose name I don't remember posted long ago for dropping pages that
contiain all zeroes.
