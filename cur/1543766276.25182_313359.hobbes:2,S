With which machine is this? 
I tried to reproduce with V0.7.45-01 in my 2xPIII 0.9 Ghz I cannot get
more than 1.9ms when doing 2000 samples repeatedly (60 iterations and
counting). 
Did you use other parameters to 'test'?
# cnt=0 
# while true

> ./test --samples 2000 file.hist 2>&1 | grep maximum; cnt=$(($cnt+1))
> done
With 2.6.12-rc3-V0.7.46-02 I get:
...
2 maximum cycle time: 0.003ms
3 maximum cycle time: 1.706ms
4 maximum cycle time: 1.538ms
5 maximum cycle time: 1.168ms
6 maximum cycle time: 0.003ms
7 maximum cycle time: 0.008ms
8 maximum cycle time: 1.821ms
9 maximum cycle time: 1.013ms
10 maximum cycle time: 1.043ms
11 maximum cycle time: 1.787ms
12 maximum cycle time: 1.519ms
13 ...
roughly the same as with 0.7.45-01:
0 maximum cycle time: 1.872ms
1 maximum cycle time: 0.008ms
2 maximum cycle time: 1.947ms
3 maximum cycle time: 1.902ms
