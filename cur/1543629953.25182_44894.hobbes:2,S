i've validated that the performance difference is due to copy_to_user().
i created a hack in the tree where a read() on a file opened with the 
option O_NOCOPY causes no copy_to_user() to occur. (diff at the bottom of 
this email).
on this test machine (dual P3 Xeon / 256K L2 cache, 2G PC133 SDRAM, QLogic 
2300 FC HBA, 8 x 15K RPM disks).
maximum theoretical performance is 2gbit/s (~200mbyte/sec).  kernel is 2.4.18.
i get the following performance numbers with 256K reads syncronously from 
the disks:
         /dev/md0 raid-0 with O_DIRECT:          91847kbyte/sec (2781usec 
avg latency/read)
         /dev/md0 raid-0:                                129455kbyte/sec 
(1978usec avg latency/read)
         /dev/md0 raid-0 with O_NOCOPY:  195868kbyte/sec (1297usec avg 
latency/read)
         requests split evenly across /dev/sd[e-l] w/ O_DIRECT:
                                                 78279kbyte/sec (3276usec 
avg latency/read)
         requests split evenly across /dev/sd[e-l]:      105130kbyte/sec 
(2437usec avg latency/read)
         requests split evenly across /dev/sd[e-l] w/ O_NOCOPY:
                                                 123050kb/sec (2088usec avg 
latency/read)
there's some interesting numbers here.
  - given the performance difference between O_NOCOPY and pristine on
    /dev/md0 one can definitely point at that being the copy_to_user() 
overhead.
  - however, when requests are split across multiple block-devices 
(/dev/sd[e-l])
    the difference are significantly decreased -- and something wierdo is 
going on:
         - readahead?
         - scsi priorities?
    perhaps some form of async i/o is required to get the performance back.
i'll do some experiments with a 2.5.xx and see if the block-layer changes 
cause any significant changes.
