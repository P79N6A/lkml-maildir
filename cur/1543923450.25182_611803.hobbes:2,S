This is part of Xen's ABI, so it isn't easily changed.  You're right
that getting monotonicity is a pretty ugly affair of doing something
like "if (now < previous_return) return ++previous_return;", but its
better than using the tsc.
(Last time around, it was "Xen can't use the tsc because it can't ever
be used as a stable timebase" - though I don't think that was you
specifically.)
