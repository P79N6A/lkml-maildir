Subject: [RFC] my current kernel todo list

Linus et al,
	Can you briefly comment about the todo list bellow? I want to help cleaning
code, but to avoid losing our time, maybe somebody can say something "hey, don't
do that" or "hey, that is wrong you stupid" or something.
	TIA,
			- Arnaldo
- get rid of check_region, use just request_region checking its return (2.2
  request_region returned void) and now the driver init sequence is not
  serialized anymore, so races are possible
- request_irq needs to be checked
- check all init_etherdev return
  - drivers allocating net_device with init_etherdev doesn't need zeroing it
    (init_etherdev does this for us)
- check all kmalloc, vmaloc, skb_alloc, etcalloc
	- check drivers/char/ip2main.c
- release previously successful allocations on failure
  - use forward gotos to release previously successfull allocations
- convert drivers to new PCI API
- remove uneeded historic code
  - checking for NULL on probe routines for net drivers
- check freeing skbs with kfree instead of kfree_skb
- get rid of panic function in drivers (watchdogs need to use machine_restart
  instead of panic 8) )
  - several char drivers do this happily :(
- get rid of isa_read/write[bwl], use ioremap instead
- sed s/return EWHATEVER/return -EWHATEVER/
- check misc_register return (yes, it can fail, murphy's law applies here as
  well)
- get rid of verify_area with copy_*_user get/put_user, only needed if
  using __copy_*_user et al
	- make sure that copy_to_user et all are checked
		- look at drivers/char/generic_serial.c
		- look at drivers/char/n_tty.c
	- get rid of copy_to_user_ret et all (Linus call)
Maybe:
- check drivers/scsi/ips.c for resource leaks (ips_release doesn't seems
  to release all the kmalloc memory it got in ips_detect. (quick look)
