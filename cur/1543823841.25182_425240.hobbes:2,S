oh yes, the ADC is multiplexed with dozens (well, actually 14)  inputs.
But you can actually very carefully prorgram which ones to read into
what register, and have you notified once completed.
Oh, and to make it even better: The ADC is used by two processors, by
the Application Processor (that runs linux) and the Baseband Processor
;)
I've now fixed that interrupt problem, but I have some other issues in
the state machine that is required for alternating pressure/xy reads.
Confident that those things can be fixed, though.
