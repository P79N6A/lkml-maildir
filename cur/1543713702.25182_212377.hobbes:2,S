Yeah, I was afraid someone would suggest that :-)
I'd actually like to do that, but that's a longer-term project.  And I
don't know the history behind efi_rtc, so maybe there's a good reason
for it being separate.
(Actually, it looks to me like gen_rtc.c ought to be killed off as well,
with both being folded into rtc.c.)
