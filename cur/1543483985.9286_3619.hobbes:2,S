Subject: compiling 2.2+ for pentium won't run on 486...

I just built 2.2.* (for pentium) and tried it
on a 486 machine (I don't recall processor
being so critical).
When it comes up it says:
	Kernel panic: Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC
and it crashes...
Shouldn't it go into a limp mode with insufficient hardware?
