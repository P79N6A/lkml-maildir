I'll try this when I get the scheduler stuff done, and also dig out the 
"resp1" stuff for "back when." I see the most recent datasets were 
comparing 2.5.43-mm2 responsiveness with 2.4.19-ck7, you know I always 
test your stuff ;-)
Guess it might need a bit of polish for current hardware, I was testing
