I doubt it's a change, more likely an undocumented requirement.  Look at
it another way: is the transmitter ready when the link is down?  No.
Why?  Because if it does attempt to transmit a packet, it will get a
transmit error, but it can't possibly be an error since it's a normal part
of bringing the link up.  Does this sound reasonable?
