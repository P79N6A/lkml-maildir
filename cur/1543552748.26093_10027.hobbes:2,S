POLLOUT checks the socketbuffer (if we're talking about sockets),
and yes you may still block on mbuf allocation (if we're talking
about FreeBSD) if the socket isn't set non-blocking.  Actually
POLLOUT may be set even if there isn't enough memory for a write
in the network buffer pool.

Yes, it's true, not using non-blocking sockets is like ignoring
friction in a physics problem, but assuming you have complete
control over the machine it shouldn't trip you up that often.  And
we're talking about readability, not writeability which as you
mentioned may block because of contention for the network buffer
pool.
