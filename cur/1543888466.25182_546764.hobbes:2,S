SLUB_DEBUG is both "bool if EMBEDDED" and "depends on SLUB", which
means just getting it to be visible in "menuconfig" is quite a challenge :-)
You first need to go into the choice where you pick the allocators ("Choose
allocator --->" which is the last option in General Setup), and then pick
SLUB as your allocator.
Then, from the General Setup again, turn on the "Configure standard
kernel features (for small systems) --->" just above the previous option
and then go into that menu. Now the option to disable SLUB_DEBUG
(which is y by default) becomes visible, so just deselect it to disable it.
