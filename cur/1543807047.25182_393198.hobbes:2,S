If that happens, it also means your container is not fully isolated which
is also a challenge for the vpid approach when you try to migrate. nop ?
If i take your example with the external process group, what would happen
if the process group leader dies and then you try to migrate that container
? How would you restore the processes in your container that are refering a
dead external process group leader ?
Everything is possible but "loose" isolation on pid raises a lot of issues
on vpids at restart. I would stick to a real strict isolation and forbid
such cases. And, in that case, it's much easier to use the pair approach
(container, pid).
We've been living with the vpid approach also for years and we found issues
that we haven't solve at restart. So we think we might do a better job with
another. But, this still needs to be confirmed :)

i don't see much changes, when you query a task by pid, you only look in
your *current* container pidspace.
some areas in the kernel use directily pids, true. Eric Biederman really
knows well his job on this topic. Many thanks. But, that could be fixed.

that's another container model issue again. your init process of a VPS
could be the real init. why do you need a fake one ? just trying to
understand all the issues you had to solve and I'm sure they are valid.

hmm, I'm not completely satisfied :) but we'll work this out, we'll find a
way to agree on something.
