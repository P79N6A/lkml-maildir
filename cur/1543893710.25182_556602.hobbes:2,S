Err, no.  I was merely questioning Ingo's reasoning that Sun wanted
Linux's drivers as badly as he made it seem.  All the fuss about
waiting for and going to GPLv3 wouldn't get them that.  Moving to
GPLv2 would, and still, they aren't doing it.  That was my point.
FWIW, I share most of your assessment and wait-and-see attitude about
Sun's situation.
