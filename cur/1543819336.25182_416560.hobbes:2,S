I'm not really working on it, but on a bigger SMP machine it might not
be that uncommon .. PI is running on all tasks now isn't it? It seems
like a simple check could be at the same point as the BUG_ON() we're
talking about .. <speculation> If that BUG_ON() triggers , it means the
task is walking the lock chain at the same time as another task on the
same chain, so you could make the lower prio chain stop at that point ..
no?

I can imagine. Seems like PI is always a point of controversy .

Did that BUG_ON ever trigger for you? I don't know how you would end up
in that state without at least two chain walkers on different cpu's ..
