Except for long plane rides, I only read it these days through filters.
Those filters watch certain people and patches that modify certain
files.  That should work pretty well, especially for those people that
really care about isolated bits of code in the kernel like certain
drivers or architectures.
I'm in awe of those who can really keep up with LKML.
