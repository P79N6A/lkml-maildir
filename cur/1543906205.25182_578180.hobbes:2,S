Most definitely, but going through the list below, I could think of
maybe several more little things that people tend to forget when actually
/implementing/ the system call (and not necessarily the abstract level
design decisions such as argument(s) and sizes).

Yes, that must definitely be spelt out clearly, probably with examples
of how to do it right.
Another thing that's a must when designing a syscall would be thinking
of any security implications that it brings about and clearly spelling
out expected behaviour in all cases -- security could mean different
things for different syscalls, but just getting that word in here would
mean people don't make basic mistakes like introducing "xxx_set_xxx"
kind of syscalls that go ahead and modify kernel/global structures
without authors having even thought of how and why that's wrong.
Other than that, as I said above, probably what we also need is a
"system call implementation checklist" of some sort, which lists out the
basic things (copying buffers from/to userspace, various security checks,
other things I'm not recollecting currently) and how to get them right.

Probably makes sense to prefix "sad" or "unfortunate" here.

Again, this is a "bad" example.
