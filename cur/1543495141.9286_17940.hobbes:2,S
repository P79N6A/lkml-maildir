That's not what my response was about. The person I was responding to had
stated (as you can see at the top) that there is a 30% performance
increase with SMP. No stipulations about I/O-based bottlenecks or
too-small RAM or anything. I want to know where he got those numbers from.
Further, I would like to know of any real-world situations where he has
actually seen performance decrease on a SMP system. In other words, I want
evidence.
I understand that when you increase the computing power of a system you
often have to increase its available resources. Bigger power supply,
faster disks, more RAM...no problem. But an example system gets only a 30%
increase in capacity once you've added a CPU and this is a result of not
enough RAM, you don't then say in a public forum it "means about [a] 30%
performance increase."
