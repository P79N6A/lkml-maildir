I would appreciate if someone could answer the following question:
obviously oom killer has been removed from 2.4.23.
the result is _bad_ in my special environment.
(xserver gets killed instead of application)
i'm sure you had very good reasons for removing the oom killer.
nevertheless i've seen, that oom_kill.c is still in mm/ but disabled with
#if 0
and out_of_memory() is not called anymore from vmscan.c.
is it sufficient to remove the #if 0 from oom_kill.c,  call out_of_memory()
from 
vmscan.c again and add PF_MEMDIE to sched.h in order to get the "old"
behaviour ?
or will this result in - i don't know - something horrible?
thanks for your help!
cheers,
pet
