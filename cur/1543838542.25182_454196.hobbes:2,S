Well, this would explain why Linux freezes while polling only if Linux
polls for the slow, static ones just as much as it does for the
dynamic ones ...

If I remember correctly (damn, I can't find a way to do a search on
the LKML archives ...) there was someone working on Dell stuff, at
least as far as fans and thermal sensors were concerned (based on the
code from Massimo Dal Zotto) to integrate them with the kernel sensors
framework. However, some of those patches where NACKed by someone from
Dell because they were sort of "guessy" about the addresses to poke
around to get the information, instead of using the data provided by
the BIOS on where to look for them ... however, there hasn't been any
news about that that stuff since ...
