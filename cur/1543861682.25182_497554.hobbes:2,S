I have such a machine that showed this problem and when I wrote the patch I 
tested it on it (and on a couple of others of course). No twice as fast on 
my testing.
In fact there are two types of ATI machines: ones that have a BIOS workaround
for the original Linux issue and ones that don't. Keeping both
happy is not easy.
So I'm somewhat dubious on that. Where is that report?

I agree. It's more problematical than I expected. Reverting is 
the best option right now.
