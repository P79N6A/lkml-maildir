I fail to follow you - yes, dev_alloc_name calls sprintf on it, but
sprintf works fine on strings without "%d", and dev_alloc_name also works
fine (despite a little suboptimal).

well, reading the part again it seems that dev_alloc_name is not "allocating
a name" but just looking for a free one. If it is indeed logically allocating
the devicename then it's a bug in dev.c. If it is just used to find a free
existing name, then it's a bug in tun.c (and elsewhere), in that it simply
shouldn't call dev_alloc_name, but instead allocates the name itself.
my personal opinion is that dev_alloc_name should work, as it would be the
logical place to do this stuff, an abstraction. it could be coded more
efficiently, but it doesn't seem to be a terrible important place anyways.
but I also must admit that I, well, know nothing ;)
