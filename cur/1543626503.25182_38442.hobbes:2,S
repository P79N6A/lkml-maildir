Subject: Patch: linux-2.5.8-pre1/kernel/exit.c change caused BUG() at boot time

	When I attempted to boot linux-2.5.8-pre1, I got a kernel
BUG() for exit.c line 519.  The was a small change to to kernel/exit.c
in 2.5.8-pre1 which deleted a kernel_lock() call.  Restoring that line
resulted in a kernel that booted fine.  I am sending this email from
the machine running that kernel (so I guess a matching release of
the kernel lock is already in the code).
	Here is the patch.  Of course, it would be helpful if someone
who actually understands this could take a look at it.
