This listing is a little different to what I got. For me,
srcpkgcache.bin did not exist when apt eventually finished. Did you
notice whether the install took a lot longer than usual ?

apt didn't hang for me, it just took 20 to 30 minutes to complete
building the package database. Usually, it takes less than a minute.
The installer stopped because it could not find a kernel to install. I
have seen this failure mde before, and as you have previously pointed
out, is probably the same problem (corrupted apt cache files), just a
different manifestation.
