Turns out we didn't have CONFIG_DEVFS_FS defined.  Big time fun when it is:
/u2/engler/mc/2.4.1/drivers/char/tty_io.c:1996:tty_register_devfs: ERROR:VAR:1996:1996: suspicious var 'tty' = 3112 bytes
/u2/engler/mc/2.4.1/drivers/char/tty_io.c:2007:tty_register_devfs: ERROR:FN:2007:2007: function stack consumes = 3146 bytes
/u2/engler/mc/2.4.1/drivers/char/tty_io.c:2031:tty_unregister_devfs: ERROR:VAR:2031:2031: suspicious var 'tty' = 3112 bytes
/u2/engler/mc/2.4.1/drivers/char/tty_io.c:2042:tty_unregister_devfs: ERROR:FN:2042:2042: function stack consumes = 3148 bytes
Right now we've just gone in and put =y for all options in .config --- is
there a more principled approach that will get more coverage?

Thanks!  If you have any other ideas of things to check for, do let us
know.  We're mainly just going after things we've found in comments and
code.  We have about another 600 potential bugs to report, but are
going over them to try to make sure they are reasonable.
