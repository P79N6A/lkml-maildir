This can only be true when device in question is behind a pci-to-pci
bridge (which is obviously not the case for ICH controllers you mentioned).
Otherwise we have plenty of MMIO space.

Linux knows how to do this for years. Actually, this is the way how alpha
and some other platforms work. Since 2.6.13, this pretty much applies to
x86 as well (we do respect BIOS PCI allocations, but we clean the things
up after BIOS quite aggressively - see pci_assign_unassigned_resources() call).
