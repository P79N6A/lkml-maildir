Subject: Patch: linux-2.5.34/drivers/ide/ide.c was building list of drives in reverse order
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	ata_attach in linux-2.5.34/drivers/ide/ide.c builds a list of
IDE drives that do not yet have a device driver bound to them, in case
ide-disk, ide-scsi, or whatever driver you want to use is not loaded
yet.
	The problem was that ata_attach was adding to the head of
the list, so the list was being built in reverse order.  So, if
you had two IDE disks, and ide-disk was a loadable module, the
devfs entries for the disks would be numbered in reverse (the
first disk would be /dev/discs/disc1, and the second would be
/dev/discs/disc0).
	The follow patch fixes the problem by changing the relevant
list_add to list_add_tail.  Incidentally, the generic code
in drivers/base/ already does it this way.
