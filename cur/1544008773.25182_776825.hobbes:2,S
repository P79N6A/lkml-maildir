It is regular suspend to ram.
I feel now confident in saying that with the debug patch resume from STR 
is 100% reliable. And the two workarounds I was using to improve resume 
reliability are no longer needed:
- unloading e1000e before suspend
- using aggressive powersave setting on snd_hda_intel to ensure that
  sound controller was already sleeping before entering suspend
I don't think we have any theory yet on how those workarounds were helping 
to improve things, right?

I cannot comment on this as I have not owned this laptop long enough.
One other thing: the ohci1394 "irq 19: nobody cared" issue is definitely 
unrelated as I just got one during a resume with the debug patch.
