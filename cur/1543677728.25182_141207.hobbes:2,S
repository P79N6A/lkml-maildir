I submitted a bug on this a while back, bug #800 in bugme:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800
I saw it starting with 2.5.70-bk15.  It looks like it did not have this
problem in 2.5.70-bk14.  Does this seem to be the case with you as
well?  I have not yet had time to hunt down more than is in that bug
report.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
