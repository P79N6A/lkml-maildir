Maybe there is some misunderstanding here: I am not playing music
from the CD. It is idle. But if I press the CD eject button, then
audio output (e.g. some mp3 file played from harddisk) gets
corrupted, the network connection is dead, etc.
Ejecting the CD takes about 7 seconds. Durig this time Linux is
dead! I haven't checked any SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR applications,
but AFAIK this shouldn't happen.
If I run "eject cdrom" on the console instead, then there is no
such problem.
