You may not want to run cachefs on *all* your NFS partitions. It will
slow you down on those partitions that have lots of cache contention.
That said, David & co.: why did you choose not to use something similar
to the Solaris syntax for cachefs? The "layered filesystem" syntax has
the advantage that it would avoid entirely the need to change the NFS
mount syntax, and would make it easier to port cachefs to cifs etc.
Cheers,
