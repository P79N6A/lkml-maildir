That is because one could enable the chipset with out AUTODMA and then
try, but crash the system, to retune the drive but the chipset is still
set at PIO 0.  Thus attempting to do DMA transfers from the drive to a
PIO 0 configured host adapter will CRASH........
This will be fixed or is pixed in 2.3.99pre2
