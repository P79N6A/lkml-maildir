The words "web of trust" (signing GPG keys) come to mind. Most software
that is GnuPG signed is signed with very short keys with no signature,
and GPG options such as --always-trust would be harmful here.
The advantage which is a difficulty at the same time is that the trust
level of each BK tree will then be different, depending on the local key
ring, trust settings and all that. This should be documented, to avoid
confusion.
