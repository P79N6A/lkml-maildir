Maybe this was true for a very early version of bzip2, but not any
longer.
The opposite is true. .bz2 contains a checksum for each block and a
running checksum (just watch bzip2 -vv file). In case of corruption you
can recover all compressed blocks but the corrupt one with bzip2recover.
Or maybe they just got bad RAM, which would show easier with bz2, since
it uses more memory for decompression than gzip.
