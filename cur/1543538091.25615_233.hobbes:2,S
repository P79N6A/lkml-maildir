It was discuted and *will be* fixed the *clean* way,
now instead of giving false argument, read the interesting thread 
( the one that discuss about how to fix the problem the right way )
and help in the design / coding area if you can.
So your "why don't include the Ingo patch" argument isn't an
argument anymore.

Talking about Non Executable stack (and *YES* i know that the patch
provide other interesting things ), it do not provide any security gain;
if you want to know why, I, and other who participated to this thread
about non exec stack will not repeat themselve 100 times, so just walk 
throught the lkml archives and read mail containing LUID / General Security 
in their subject.

Theses things you're talking about are going to be done in a clean way
(and you'll maybe already know it if you was reading the interesting 
mail (not this thread) ).
Maintaining this thread alive doesn't even brought any quality 
discution about design / code thingies...
now help coding and stop maintaining this offtopic discutions.
This thread should die.
Ps : if you wish to continue this BS thread, 
     please remove the lkml address from the CC : it will, at least, 
     prevent to bloat the list with non existing and offtopic things,
     and people CC'd will be free to not answer your email message.

     It is well known that M$ products don't call free() after a malloc().
     The Unix community wish them good luck for their future developments.
