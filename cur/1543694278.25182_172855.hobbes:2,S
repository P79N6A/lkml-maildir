I haven't got the original message (mail problems) so I'm responding here.
I misread your message, and thought you said compression.
My Duron 1300 (hardly the fastest machine) compresses (gzip -1) at around
40Mb/sec (repetitive log-files that compress to 5% using gzip -1) and 
10Mb/sec on text (compressing to 40%).
On expansion, it decompresses compressed text at around 14Mb/sec (resulting
in 30Mb/sec, around my disk speed), and logfiles at 110Mb/sec, which is 
significantly faster.
This is with a single stick of PC133 RAM, and a tiny 64K cache.
I would be very surprised if even a high end consumer machine couldn't handle
50Mb/sec.
