I'm sorry, but I don't see where in the paragraphs above you aren't
making a general argument against the pathname model.  I'm not trying to
get into that discussion (I'm smart enough to know I'm far too stupid to
hold my own there).
I do understand that AA is different from selinux, and that you
have valid points about the level and type of protection that AA offers.
But, this is a completely different discussion than if AA is
solving problems in the wild for its intended audience, or if the code
is somehow flawed and breaking other parts of the kernel.
We've been over the "AA is different" discussion in threads about a
billion times, and at the last kernel summit.  I think Lars and others
have done a pretty good job of describing the problems they are trying
to solve, can we please move on to discussing technical issues around
that?
