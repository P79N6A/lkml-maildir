We do we refcount ZERO_PAGE at all?
Ok, there may be multiple, but they exist always and always at
the same physical addresses, right?
So why do we care at all?
Memory hotplug?
Doesn't it suffice there, that they are reverse mappable?
Aren't they a perfect candidate for a VM_UNPAGED from /dev/zero :-)
