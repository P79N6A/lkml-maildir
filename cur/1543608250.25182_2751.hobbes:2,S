What my

Ok. I re-checked the code and found out this approach cannot stand.   
the list scan _is_ already exited early when priority is low:         
        int max_scan = nr_inactive_pages / priority;                  
                                                                      
        while (--max_scan >= 0 && (entry = inactive_list.prev) !=     
&inactive_list) {                                                     
                                                                      
It will not make big sense to do it again in max_mapped.              
                                                                      
On the other hand I am also very sure, that refining:                 
                                                                      
        if (max_mapped==0)                                            
                swap_out(priority, gfp_mask, classzone);              
                                                                      
        return nr_pages;                                              
                                                                      
in the end to:                                                        
                                                                      
        if (max_mapped==0 && nr_pages>0)                              
                swap_out(priority, gfp_mask, classzone);              
                                                                      
        return nr_pages;                                              
                                                                      
is a good thing. We don't need swap_out if we gained all the pages    
requested, no matter if we _could_ do it or not.                      
                                                                      
Is there some performance difference in this approach, Lorenzo? I     
guess it should.                                                      
                                                                      
Regards,
