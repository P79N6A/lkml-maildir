Actually, I figured he was taking this from a fairly well known lock-free
method. The problems with the normal method in the general case are:
1. It can livelock. The more the lock is contended for, the more likely this
is.
2. Data size of the lock grows linearly with number of contenders (CPUs in
this case).
3. Time required to scan grows linearly with number of contenders.
I believe he is only suggesting it be used to check if there was contention,
if it fails you fall back to the locked transactions. That may remove the
problem with livelock.

I agree that it isn't worth the trouble and added complexity.
