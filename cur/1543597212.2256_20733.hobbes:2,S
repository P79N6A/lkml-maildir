There are a lot more bugs (and "send-in" patches to Ted) which fix a lot of 
problems even in the 2.4.7-x driver.
I know about a guy "Ian Abbott" (abbotti at mev.co.uk) which is active on the 
serial.sf.net bug-list and has done a lot good to the serial driver. Perhaps 
he should be heard regarding this.
Personally I found a (h/w) timinig problem in the inititalisation code which 
hangs the "sunix" chips (and freezes the complete box). But since I couldn't 
get my hands on a datasheet of these chips, I've until now only solved this 
problem through a hand full of delays after "critical" I/O operations (very 
ugly).
Salut, Jörg
