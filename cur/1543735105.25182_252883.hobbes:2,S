|

| timer2 after 10*110ms = 1100ms,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I agree that timeval_to_jiffies() has some serious rounding errors.
I don't see why it even cares about any of the scaled math in the
(inline) function.  I rewrote it (for userspace, not kernelspace)
like so, with expected results:
static __inline__ unsigned long
tv_to_jifs(const struct timeval *value)
{
        unsigned long sec = value->tv_sec;
        long usec = value->tv_usec;
        if (sec >= MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES){
                sec = MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES;
                usec = 0;
        }
        return (((u64)sec * (u64)HZ) +
                (((u64)usec + (u64)HZ - 1LL) / (unsigned long)HZ));
}
Results of timeval_to_jiffies() compared to tv_to_jifs() [small sample]:
(tv_sec is fixed at 5, with tv_usec varying)
                         +--- timeval_to_jiffies()
                         V              v--- tv_to_jifs()
tv_usec: 499000,     jifs: 5500,     jf2: 5499
tv_usec: 499100,     jifs: 5500,     jf2: 5500
tv_usec: 499900,     jifs: 5501,     jf2: 5500
tv_usec: 500000,     jifs: 5501,     jf2: 5500
tv_usec: 500100,     jifs: 5501,     jf2: 5501
tv_usec: 500900,     jifs: 5502,     jf2: 5501
tv_usec: 501000,     jifs: 5502,     jf2: 5501
tv_usec: 501100,     jifs: 5502,     jf2: 5502
tv_usec: 501900,     jifs: 5503,     jf2: 5502
tv_usec: 502000,     jifs: 5503,     jf2: 5502
tv_usec: 502100,     jifs: 5503,     jf2: 5503
I think that tv_to_jifs() can be written for kernel use by using
do_div(), but I haven't tried that yet.
