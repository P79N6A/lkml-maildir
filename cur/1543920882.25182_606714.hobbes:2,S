I don't think we little angels want to tread here.  There are so many
weirdo things out there which will break if we bust the coherence between
the fs and /dev/hda1.  Online resize, online fs checkers, various local
tools which people have hacked up to look at metadata in a live fs,
direct-io access to the underlying fs, heaven knows how many boot loader
installers, etc.  Cerainly I couldn't enumerate tham all.
The mere thought of all this scares the crap out of me.
I don't actually see what the conceptual problem is with the existing
implementation.  The buffer_head is a finer-grained view onto the
blockdev's pagecache: it provides additional states and additional locking
against a finer-grained section of the page.   It works well.
Yeah, the highmem thing is a bit of a problem (but waning in importance). 
But we can fix that by teaching individual filesystems about kmap and then
tweak the blockdev's caching policy with mapping_set_gfp_mask() at mount
time.  If anyone cares, which they don't.
