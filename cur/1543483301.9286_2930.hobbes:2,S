This is not the kernel! This is about 300 megabytes of stuff that came
off a distribution disk. A lot is text in /usr/info. A system that has
a 'C' compiler and its necessary includes, X11 with its comprssed fonts,
some man pages, and a current kernel, only takes about 40 megabytes.
If you remove the man pages, you save another 15. Note that you can
make a bootable system that will run the vim editor, mount, and a
few other basic 'fix-your-system` tools on two floppy disks with
no RAM disk. I have such a rescue disk pair.
Cheers,

Penguin : Linux version 2.1.131 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
Warning : It's hard to remain at the trailing edge of technology.
Wisdom  : It's not a Y2K problem. It's a Y2Day problem.
