Subject: [PATCH] swap 2/4 unsafe SwapCache check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Recent testing has shown that the BUG() check in try_to_unuse is unsafe.
delete_from_swap_cache does final swap_free just after removing page
from swap cache, and add_to_swap_cache does swap_duplicate just before
putting page into swap cache, therefore swapin_readahead may resurrect
a dying swap entry and assign a new page to it.  That's fine, there's
no need to change this ordering; but it does mean that try_to_unuse's
page may have left the swap cache yet its swap_map count still be set.
That BUG() has done good service for swapoff sanity, but now abandon it.
