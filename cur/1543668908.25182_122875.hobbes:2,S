You've to enable the input device support as compiled in the kernel,
not as module.

You don't need this now...the kernel builder now is smart enought to know
what has to recompile and what doesn't have.

and make dep isn't needed now AFAIK

The same for this; when you apply a patch; just a "make" will recompile
the files you need; see "make help" for help ;)

As I said, this has to be compiled inside the kernel (you also want keyboard
support, right? ;). If you don't compile it; or compile it as
module; the "virtual terminal support" menu entry won't appear for some
reason....
I think that a BIG warning should be added if CONFIG_INPUT isn't compiled
