Just to end this thread in a victorous manner ;-), thanks to Michel Dänzer
<michdaen@iiic.ethz.ch> and me, there is now a working implementation of
busmastered video transfers for the r128 driver, and it has been submitted to
all relevant lists and maintainers. It indeed solved the problem, CPU time
eaten by video transfers is negligible and DVD and "DivX ;-)" playback was
never so smooth. With software-only DVD decoder, watching fullscreen DVD
leaves 50-60% CPU time idle on a Duron 650, even on action-packed scenes. If
I catch someone claiming again that Linux isn't suitable for multimedia, I can
just laugh now :-).
