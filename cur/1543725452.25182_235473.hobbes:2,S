The mga dri kernel driver shares a problem with the radeon (which I use
a lot) and the r128 drivers. They have high latency points that reach
10-15 msecs in normal operation[*]. I have a very old patch (not mine, I
don't quite remember where I got it from) that solves this, but it is
not a "legal" patch in the sense that in schedules with a lock held. It
seems to work but it will lock the computer at some point. AFAIK there
is no proper patch for this latency point at this time. Turning off
acceleration should get rid of the latency spikes with the usual
tradeoff of slow video performance.
