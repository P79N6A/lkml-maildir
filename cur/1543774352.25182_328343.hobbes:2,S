I haven't found any reason why CONFIGFS_FS is user-visible.
Other parts of the kernel using configfs should simply select it.

-	  configfs is a ram-based filesystem that provides the converse
-	  of sysfs's functionality. Where sysfs is a filesystem-based
-	  view of kernel objects, configfs is a filesystem-based manager
-	  of kernel objects, or config_items.
-
-	  Both sysfs and configfs can and should exist together on the
-	  same system. One is not a replacement for the other.
