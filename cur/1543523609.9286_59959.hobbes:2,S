This is one place where r/w semaphores might make it a _lot_ easier to
get the locking right in a fairly general manner.  Ben's semaphores are
_really_ lean to take, and using scheduler-safe locks will make it much
easier to delegate the locking to the mid-layers instead of forcing
every driver to do it internally.
