Any misinformation found there must have been deliberately put there
to generate reactions from the Linux community.  Please ignore them.
Think about it: Why sending a list of satisfy linux users to them?
So that they can target their marketing power on these users?  
Why correct them of their misconception? (whether deliberately put 
there or not)  Why argue with them when we knew all they will do is
ignore us?  Probably covering their ears and chat NT is better, 
NT is better...
If you post a response, it is easy to prove some of those responses are
wrong by simply a case or two where it doesn't apply.  This would make
their propaganda even more believable.  We end up throwing the ball
back and fore...  At lease now, most knowledgeable people know there
is something wrong in those article and I'll leave it at that.
Responding to such things will only waste developers' time, slow down
linux development, make us target the wrong area of development.  We
could end up trying to improve on insignificant areas of the kernel
while the important technology are falling behind.
Why don't we just drop this thread and work on problems we have here?
There are definite IDE/SMP/Network/crash threads floating around for 
some time.
