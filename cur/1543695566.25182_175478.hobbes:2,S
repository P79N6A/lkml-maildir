Actually gettimeofday() does NOT do that.  It always returns GMT since 1970. 
The daylight savings thing is really a timezone shift, not a time shift.
My suggestion, which I admit may rely on a particular distro, is to define two 
new run levels.  One for going to sleep and one to wake up.  This is how the 
system boots and powers down already.  The new levels would allow applications 
which have special needs to put the proper notifier stuff in the runlevel 
directory, just as is done for boot/ shutdown.  It is this code which should 
tell the system to sleep, just as the shutdown run level shuts off the machine.
