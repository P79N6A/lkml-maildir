That's the biggest problem. I fear it might be necessary to make checks
device specific (at least for device classes) *and* even include operation
modes.
For example WRITE BUFFER in default mode would be safe and maybe useful
for read. However it can also be used to overwrite firmware, which makes it
unsafe even for regular write.

The question is how other device types will interpret some of those commands.
