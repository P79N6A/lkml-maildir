It is not uncommon to have a large number of tmp files on the disk(s) (Rik also
pointed this out somewhere early in the original thread) and it is sensible to
keep all of them in buffers if RAM is sufficient. Transfering _very_ large
files is not _that_ common so why shouldn't that case be handled from the user
space by calling sync(2)?
