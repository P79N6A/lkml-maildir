Yes, correct.  Normally, it is useful to have error messages show up
on the console when a mount fails for whatever reason.  But when you
are doing autodetecton the stupid way (by trying to brute force mount
every single filesystem type), the error messages get annoying.  In
init/do_mounts.c, it is trying to do the exact same thing, which is
why it passes MS_VERBOSE (now MS_SILENT) as a mount option.
