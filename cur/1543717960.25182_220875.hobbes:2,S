Second reply with some interesting developments.
I ran Andy's bk exersisor script on a vendor supplied kernel (2.6.3-4mdk) for
36 iterations, with no failures at all.
I then stopped that test, updated the 2.6-tree to the state at 15:00 MDT today,
compiled with the above two DEBUG options, and rebooted with that new
kernel.
I ran Andy's script again, and it caused a failure right away.  Here is a
snipped version of the log:
renumber: can't read SCCS info in "SCCS/s.ChangeSet".
include/asm-x86_64/SCCS/s.i387.h
[list of files snipped]
net/ipv4/SCCS/s.ip_output.c
Your repository should be back to where it was before undo started
We are running a consistency check to verify this.
check passed
Undo failed, repository left locked.

The digits in column 1 above are an iteration count from the testing script.
I control-c'ed out at that point.
For reference, here is Andy's script again:
#!/bin/sh
x=0
while true; do
        bk clone -qlr40514130hBbvgP4CvwEVEu27oxm46w testing-2.6 foo
        (cd foo; bk pull -q)
        rm -rf foo
        x=`expr $x + 1`
        echo -n "$x "
done
The RESYNC directory in 'foo' does not contain an SCSS directory.
There were no unusual messages in dmesg.
In the spirit of 'rounding up the usual suspects', I'll unset CONFIG_PREEMT
and try again.
