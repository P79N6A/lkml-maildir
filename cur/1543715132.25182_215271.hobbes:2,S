Hmm, looks like we have an element of commonality - I also am on a 10
MBit half duplex network ( an old corporate switch thing with no
auto-sensing ).
Unfortunately the chance of persuading the powers that be to buy some
less prehistoric networking gear is ... slight :)
I've also tried the eepro100 driver and get the same symptoms, but I
notice that both drivers use the mii module, which appears to be main
element of commonality.
