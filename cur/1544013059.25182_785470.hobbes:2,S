This doesn't work.
We've had this bug several times now, and one of them just very recently.
Some gcc versions will inline weak functions if they are in scope - even 
if there is a non-weak function somewhere else. So you MUST NOT have the 
weak definition in the same file (or indirectly called through some inline 
functions in a header file) as the call. Because if you do, then any user 
with the wrong version of gcc will get the weak function semantics, even 
if it was meant to be overridden by something else.

We don't write out that whole "__attribute__" crud. We use
	unsigned in __weak arch_module_section_size(struct module *mod, unsigned int section)
instead. But as mentioned, it needs to be in another compilation unit.
