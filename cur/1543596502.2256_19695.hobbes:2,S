It's a good old tradition to put macros in uppercase letters. This would 
have avoided one fatal error in your patch, the conflict with the gcc 
built-in 
	int abs(int);
which has it's prototype in include/linux/kernel.h. There's places which 
depend on this and would break with your macro.
Also, unless you have more macros in mind, it may make sense to just place 
MIN, MAX in kernel.h and of course to remove similar macro definitions 
throughout the kernel and replace them by the commonly defined ones.
