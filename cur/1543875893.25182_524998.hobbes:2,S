That one's not fine.

You implemented nanosecond accounting, but here you give a task which
has either missed the tick ofter enough, or accumulated enough cross cpu
clock drift to have an I.O.U. in it's wallet a shiny new $8 bill.
WRT  clock drift/timewarps, your latest code cedes that these do occur,
but where these timewarps can be anywhere between minuscule with Intel
same package processors, up to a tick elsewhere, charges a tick.

Hm.  How, where?
I'm getting inconsistent results with current, but sleeping tasks still
don't _appear_ to be able to compete with hogs on an equal footing, and
I don't see how they really can.
What happens if a sleeper sleeps after using say half of it's slice, and
the hog it's sharing the CPU with then sleeps briefly after using most
of it's slice.  That's the end of the rotation.  They are put back on an
equal footing, but what just happened to the differential in cpu usage?

The behavior is different, and is less ragged, but I wouldn't say it's
really been improved.  The below was added as a workaround.

I don't really know what to say about this.  I think it explains reduced
context switching, but I don't see how this could be a good thing.
Consider a nice -20 fast/light task trying to get CPU with nice 0 tasks
being constantly spawned.  How can this latency bound fast mover perform
if it can't preempt?  What am I missing?

Opinion polls are nice, but I'm more interested in gathering numbers
which either validate or invalidate the claims of the design documents.
 
WRT this subjective opinion thing, I see regressions with all loads, and
I don't see what a < 95% load really means.  If CPU isn't contended,
dishing it out is dirt simple.  Just give everybody frequent, and fairly
short chunks, and everybody is fairly happy.  The only time scheduling
becomes interesting is when there IS contention, and mainline seems to
do much better at this, with the caveat that the history mechanism
indeed doesn't always get it right.
