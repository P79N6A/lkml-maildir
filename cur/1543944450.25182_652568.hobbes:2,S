Perhaps not, but self-conflicts are the bigger issue for the
networking.
If I (or Jeff or John) push a bug fix to you outside of the merge
window, that blows the entire development tree because at 1500+
changesets I can guarentee you there will be a merge conflict
somewhere.
Near the end of 2.6.24 every bug fix I merged to you created a
conflict with my net-2.6.25 tree.  Every time I rebased there
were on the order of 10 to 20 patches with merge conflicts to
resolve.
