I don't think the swap space = 2 x RAM rule every applied to Linux,
but there were certainly vendor Unices that suggested this. This
requirement was often related to the fact that upon a kernel panic an
image of your memory contents at the time of the panic was dumped to
the swap partition for later diagnosis. Linux doesn't do this.
In fact, under Linux, with that much RAM, you don't need a swap file
at all. Of course if you plan on running applications that take large
amounts of RAM you might want some swap space. Or if you want the
system to swap out idle applications you might want some.
The short of it is that it depends on what you use your system for and
what the applications you run on it demand. There is no hard rule,
under Linux, for swap space.
