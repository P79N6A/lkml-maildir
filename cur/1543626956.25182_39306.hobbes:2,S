Andries --
I have docs on this thing.  It's been an on-again, off-again project with
some other developers.  You're the first to be able to write to the thing.
The translation is designed to preserve integrity -- i.e. you write the
data, then atomically set one block invalid and another valid.  There's
actually a command for this at the controller-level.
I suggest that, if you're serious about finishing this, you get on board
the usb-storage devel team (contact me off-lists about this), so we can get
you access to the specs and then get this thing working.
