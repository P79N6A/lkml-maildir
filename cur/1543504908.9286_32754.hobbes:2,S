ide-scsi is for use with ATA ("IDE") devices that use
packet commands similar (damned near identical) to SCSI.
It just takes the SCSI packet, does some massaging,
and sends it out the ATA interface to the target device.
Thus, the target device has to understand packet commands.
This includes CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, newer ZIP, and tape drives.
All current ATA hard drives use register-based commands
rather than packet commands (much lower overhead this way).
That may change once ATA disks get bigger than 128GB in size,
the hard upper limit of the current register interface.
In the meanwhile, I suppose one could take and write an ide-scsi-disk
driver.. but it might be better to just replace the IDE subsystem
with a SCSI-adaptor layer for ATA interfaces/devices.
Ugh.
