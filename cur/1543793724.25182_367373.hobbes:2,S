Ah, this is odd indeed: your hardware uses 800 scanlines
(overflow:(512+256)+vdisp_end:0x1f), while the actual needed lines
should be y:25*fonth:16 ... Maybe it is actually using a 32 lines font.
Just to make sure about every VGA bits, could you install the
svgatextmode package, which holds a getVGAreg command, and run twice
for i in `seq 0 24` ; do getVGAreg CRTC $i ; done
The first time while having a correct full text screen rendering, and
the second time after vgacon_doresize() has blanked the bottom half of
the screen.
Regards,
Samuel
