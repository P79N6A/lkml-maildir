yeah. Section 2 of the GPLv2 takes a permissive (and IMO correct) 
approach here:
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
the argument is quite strong that the linking of two independent works 
is "mere aggregation" as well. (as long as they are truly separate 
works)
