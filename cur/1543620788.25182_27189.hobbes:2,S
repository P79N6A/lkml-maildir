Hi All,
  Well forgive me for not being up on the lastest news but from building
2.5.4 kernel for my box, which uses the cs46xx.c sound driver, it would
appear that virt_to_bus and bus_to_virt has gone the way of the do-do. 
  What's the correct method now? 
  Be nice to get this cleaned up....
  Regards,
  Tom
