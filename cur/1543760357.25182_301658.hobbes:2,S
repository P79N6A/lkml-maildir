but.... tasks don't have an IP address. Hosts do. Hosts can have
multiple IP addresses. Both ipv4 and ipv6.  Users don't have IP
addresses either (they do have user IDs so that link is clear). 
I think I'm missing something big here. What does it *mean* for a task
to have an IP address. Once that is clear maybe I can start to
understand the rest, but until the meaning of "task has an IP address"
is better explained/more clear I think I'm stuck. (and no the output in
a log isn't a meaning, it's only a result)
