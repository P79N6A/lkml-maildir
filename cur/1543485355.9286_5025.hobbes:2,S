Ok, but which are the cases the dentry go away while the inode pointed by
the dentry is still perfectly valid? Here I can't see any kind of icache
problem. In the code I seen that d_invalidate(entry) try to prune the
dentries of the subdirs of `entry', but I have not clear how
d_invalidate() is used.
Here number of unused inodes is still close to 0 as usual:
andrea@laser:/usr/src/linux/fs$ cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state 
0       22529   45      0       0       0
andrea@laser:/usr/src/linux/fs$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr 
8205    8
andrea@laser:/usr/src/linux/fs$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-max    
8192
This with a perfectly normal system usage.
I have no problem in rejecting my first patch when I'll understand which
are the cases that impacts the icache. I'll search better for them this
evening...
Thanks.
