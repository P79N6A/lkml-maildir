Subject: down_interruptible use in the new SCSI code after 2.2.0-pre8

scsi_error.c uses down_interruptible in a way that is no longer valid
with the recursive semaphores introduced in 2.2.0-pre8. The end result
is that when  there are 2 scsi hosts using the new scsi code and the
first scsi error is triggered, the error handler task loops forever
trying to activate itself and the system totally locks.
A very simple fix is to add
sem.owner_depth = 0;
just before down_interruptible(&sem) in scsi_error.c.
