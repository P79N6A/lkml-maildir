3c59x.o.  Yeah, we don't have a clean solution for this. An `alias
3c575_cb 3c59x' in modules.conf will fix it, but screws you up if you
boot 2.2.  Manually adding the symlink is another way.

It's not reading the EEPROM correctly.  Please apply the patch at
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/3c59x.patch
 and if that doesn't
work, please invert the value of EEPROM_8BIT in your NIC's entry in
vortex_pci_tbl[] and let me know the outcome.
