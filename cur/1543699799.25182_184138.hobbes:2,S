I don't think it belongs in per-cpu data, that's a bit disingenous.
It's a separate section by itself, I think.  But it's also fairly
rare.
The smp_call_function() case is more subtle, but in fact, there are
only two calls to smp_call_function in non-arch-specific code, and
both are wrong:
mm/slab.c: smp_call_function_all_cpus() should just be on_each_cpu.
net/core/flow.c: This should also be on_each_cpu: I actually have a
		 patch for this, too.
The aim of this document is to give the reader an overview core
techniques, not describe every possible variant.  IMHO a more likely
candidate for a section would be atomic_dec_and_lock(), which there is
no real concept of an "owner" of an object, but the destroy is
implicit (and atomic) by the last user.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
