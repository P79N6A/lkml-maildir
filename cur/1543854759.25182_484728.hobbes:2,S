Don't have much clue, still...:(
The logic of the while loop in ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv() looks
like:
while (1) {
	/*make a new reservation window*/
	ret = allocate_new_reservation();
	if (ret < 0)
		break /*fail*/
	/*allocate a block from the reservation window */
	ret = ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv()
	if (ret > 0) {
		...
		break;	/*success*/
	}
}
If it stucks in the loop, that means next two things have to be true: 
1) ext2_try_to_allocate() keeps failing to allocate a bit from the
window just reserved, every time.  
2) we could endlessly create a new reservation window in this block
group.
For (1), when create a new reservation window, we do make sure there are
at least one free bit in the window, so that
ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv() could claim that bit. I haven't found
any thing wrong in that part yet;
For (2)the search for the next reservation window should start from the
end block of the old window, and should stop and fail if it reachs the
last block of the block group. 
Will continue looking at the code, but so far everything looks just fine
to me.:(

A bit confused, did the whole system hang or just the "ld" writer hang
in ext2 block allocation? And what other writers were waiting for? Were
they trying to write to the same file?

It might be helpful to check the return value of ext2_try_to_allocate(),
to see if it fails. It would be nice if you could check if there any
free bit inside the reservation window.
And could you check the start and end block for every rsv_window_add and
rsv_window_remove, to see if it was keep creating and removing the same
window in the same block group?
And it might be useful to dump the whole filesystem block reservation
tree as well.
Not sure if it worth the effort to test it on ext3.  The ext2 block
reservation code in 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 looks pretty much the same as ext3/4,
except the missing truncate_mutex. I understand this might take a few
days to reproduce, so this might not needed now.
