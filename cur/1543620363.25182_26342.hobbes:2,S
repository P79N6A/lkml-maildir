Is there any syscall that can guarantee that a single packet has been sent out
over the wire?  Suppose I want to broadcast an ARP packet.  If I make a packet
socket and call sendto() on it, I want a guarantee that the packet will make it
out onto the wire, or the sendto() should fail.
UDP failing I can understand (kind of, anyway) but for raw sockets, packet
sockets, etc. I think there should be at least some kind of mechanism to bypass
all the congestion controls and either shove the packet onto the device's tx
buffer or return a failure code.
The possibility of random dropping of packets in the kernel means that an
infinite loop on sendto() will chew up the entire machine even if you've only
got a 10Mbit/s link.  This seems just wrong.
