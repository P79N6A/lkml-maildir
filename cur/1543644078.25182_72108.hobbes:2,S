Normally yes, but not always. e.g. for squid you don't really want to 
cache user space.
But I guess it would be a reasonable heuristic. Or at least worth a try :-)

SSE2 has hints for that (prefetchnti and even prefetcht0,1 etc. for different
cache hierarchies), but it's not completely clear on how much
the CPUs follow these. 
For writing it's much more obvious and usually documented even.

They should be aligned, otherwise it makes no sense. When you assume it's
more likely that one target or destination are unaligned then you can easily
align either target or destination. Trick is to chose the right one,
it varies on the call site.
(these are for big copies so a small alignment function is lost in the noise)
x86-64 copy_*_user currently aligns the destination, but hardcoding that
is a bit dumb and I'm not completely happy with it.
