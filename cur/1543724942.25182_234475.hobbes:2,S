I'm glad I'm not the only one that is suspecting that.  I just tried
switching my T40p from APM to ACPI.  I got suspending to RAM working in
ACPI, but noticed that when I got it back out of my laptop bag later, it
was physically warm to the touch.  It also had consumed more battery
power than it would have when suspended with APM.  And, if I would shine
a bright light on the screen, I could make out text on it.  In other
words, the backlight was off but it was still displaying stuff.
