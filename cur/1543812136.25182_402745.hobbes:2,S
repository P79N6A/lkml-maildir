Hmm I would have guessed the first is way more common, the device/driver
consuming lots of iommu space would be the most likely to run into
IOMMU-OOM.

I was thinking just a global one, we are in soft error handling anyways
so should be ok. I don't think you would need to dirty any global cache
line unless you actually need to wake waiters.

I think so, yes.
