It is easier than that. Nobody should be rebuilding the firmware apart
from driver mantainers. If driver version in 2.4.5 is 6.1.13, that version
includes a certain firmware in .h format and that is all. Apart from
this, the author (Justin) can make available in his web page one other
package for driver testers or developers including aicasm and firmware
source. But that should not be in the kernel tree.
If there are updates to the firmware, just send the patch for .h files
to kernel mantainers and/or lkml, as everybody does.
This is easier, doesn't it ?
