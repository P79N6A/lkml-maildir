Let me see if I understand you.  If SS and DS point to segments that
have different base addresses then code like this...  (I'm an assembly
newbie.  hope I get this right.)
# get whatever is at %ss:%esp + 4 and put it in eax
movl 4(%esp), %eax
movl %esp, %edx
# get whatever is at %ds:%edx + 4 and put it in eax
movl 4(%edx), %eax
# eax probably changed twice because while esp and edx have same value,
# if SS->baseaddr != DS->baseaddr, then (%esp) and (%edx) don't point to
# the same memory location.
I'm pretty sure I've seen plenty of code like this, which must mean,
like you just told me, that the C compiler assumes the base address of
DS and SS are the same.  So, if I want to change segment base addresses
then I'm up shit creek.
Thanks very much for the info!
