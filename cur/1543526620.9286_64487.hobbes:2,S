   The only problem with this is that at least in the late 2.2.x kernels
   UUID or volume label mounting breaks when the filesystems in question
   are on a RAID1 mirror.
Yeah, unfortunately the Raid1 descriptor block is at the end of the
partition, not at the beginning, it makes this confusion possible.
One easy way of fixing this for mount and company is to check the size
of the filesystem in the superblock.  If it's bigger than the physical
size of the partition, then mount should skip the physical device, and
then find the MD device instead.
