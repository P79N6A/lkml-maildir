Simply just matching on *defconfig should be fine. I already changed this on
matching defconfig-* for sh to get around matching SCCS.

Agreed. The whole reason I did the automated "- Build for foo" thing is that
it's completely automated, and people building should already know what their
target is (if not, they can look at arch/$(ARCH)/Kconfig and figure it out).
I suppose it's not particularly descriptive, but it seems more sensible to
have an abbreviated help text then none whatsoever.
