While the first is fairly clear on what the content might be,
its not very clear what the second is referring to..At first
I figured they were going to be discussing techniques like
how to automate the benchmark process to make it faster
(which would overlap with the first, I imagine?), but if not,
is it going to be about which benchmarks to run etc? or how to
avoid benchmark legalese miseries that can make them a big
headache?? :)
thanks,
