yeah - found a bug that could explain the symptoms on your system.  
Called softlockup_tick() from the global timer interrupt, instead of the 
per-CPU timer interrupt. So on SMP the other CPUs would not see any 
softlockup ticks at all, and would incorrectly report soft lockups.  
This bug is fixed in the -48-36 patch i just uploaded.
