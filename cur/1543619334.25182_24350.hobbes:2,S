So basically you are telling me these are my options:
    1) Someone is going to have to recode the ircd source we use and
possibly a modified kernel in the *hope* that performance improves.
    2) Convert the box to FreeBSD which seems to have a better poll()
implementation, and where I could support 8K clients easily as other admins
on my chat network do already.
    3) Move the ircd processes to some 400Mhz Ultra 5's running Solaris-8
which run 3-4K users at 60% cpu!
Now I want to run Linux but unless I get this issue resolved I'm essentialy
not utilizing my hardware to the best of its ability.
Vince.
