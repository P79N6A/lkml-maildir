These values belong to the clock, NTP specifies the speed of the clock via 
tick/frequency, these variables specify the current state of the clock. If 
we assume there is only one system clock, we need only one set of those, 
so leaving them in timer.c doesn't really hurt. How these variables are 
updated depends on the clock, so separating them doesn't make much sense.

Cleaning up the code would be nice, but that shouldn't be the priority 
right now, first we should get the math right.
I looked a bit more on this aspect of your patch and I think it's overly 
complex even for continuous time sources. You can reduce the complexity 
by updating the clock in more regular intervals. 
What basically is needed to update in constant intervals (n cycles) a 
reference time controlled via NTP and the system time. The difference 
between those two can be used to adjust the cycle multiplier for the next 
n cycles to speed up or slow down the system clock.
Calculating the offset in constant intervals makes the math a lot simpler, 
basically the current code is just a special case of that, where it 
directly updates the system time from the reference time at every tick.
(In the end the differences between tick based and continuous sources may 
be even smaller than your current patches suggest. :) )
bye, Roman
