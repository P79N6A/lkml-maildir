For reasons I don't claim to understand, the nvidia drivers have much
better 2D acceleration as well.  And with the patches from www.minion.de
they work acceptably under 2.5.64, modulo a few issues:
At least on my Dell laptop (GeForce 440 2Go), the 'GLX' extension will wedge up
the X server (ctl-alt-del still reboots, so the kernel is still there).
Restarting the X server hangs the machine sometimes.
I'm going to take a shot at debugging those two issues now that my office is
remodelled and I have a fighting chance of hooking something to the serial
port for debugging. ;)
