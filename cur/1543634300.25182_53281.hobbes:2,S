I have generated high load to test how accurately my genrtc driver will 
work - it turned out that timers added with add_timer occassionally
get delayed by several jiffies. Results were much worse on IO bound 
load, especially IDE drives, CPU intensive userspace apps didn't appear 
to matter.
Using schedule_task() to poll the event seems to work without any 
problems.

this was also my impression after looking at the lowlevel interrupt
handling so I am really puzzled.
