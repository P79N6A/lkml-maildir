Yes, the current openSUSE basically uses the same setup, but this will change

That's what i like about it and the part i want to keep: do all the
workarounds in one place, ideally with locked VTs and maybe mlock()ed, but get
the workaround options from HAL.
I also had the impression that i had said this quite clearly, but the talk was
short, so the "data compression" of the information might not have been
lossless :-)
Hope this helps to clear up the confusion.
