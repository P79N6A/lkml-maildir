Agreed on these points, but you really HAVE TO work towards
flushing the page ->writepage() gets called for.
Think about your typical PC, with memory in ZONE_DMA,
ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_HIGHMEM. If we are short on DMA pages
we will end up calling ->writepage() on a DMA page.
If the filesystem ends up writing completely unrelated pages
and marking the DMA page in question referenced the VM will
go in a loop until the filesystem finally gets around to
making a page in the (small) DMA zone freeable ...

Rik
