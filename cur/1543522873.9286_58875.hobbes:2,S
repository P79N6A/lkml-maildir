I find that automounting infrequently referenced filesystems does
help a log with the fsck-after-crash problem.
Another one that I am trying but can't get to work is to have the
filesystem mounted "ro,user" by default, but I can't seem to "-o
remount,rw" (or the other way) as a user. I haven't started to track
it down yet, but is this likely to be a mount issue or a kernel
issue?
