Reviewing the 'compatible' values in my device-tree, I definately agree.
I can hack the pmac_zilog driver to test this out further - I've just
been using my airport card.
Are there any other "invalid" characters for the compatible property?
CRLF would work, but these values (as a group) need to be put into
modules.ofmap as well as passed via environment variables for hotplug.
As such, CRLF isn't really easiest choice to work with.
Is whitespace (in any form) allowed in the compatible value?
