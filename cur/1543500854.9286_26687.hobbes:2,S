Not at all, but lets take one thing at a time. IMHO the best way to
compare an ftp test should be "PC with Pentium X at speed Y, with QMB
memory" + plug in whatever netcard/disk controller you can find for
less than $Z. That way people can compare to whatever they feel most
comfortable with under a certain OS and you wont have anybody moaning
about them losing because they were forced to use a badly supported
NIC etc.
