That's true when the hash table has a reasonable size. But with 1MB 
and bigger hash tables you are guaranteed to get a cache miss for most
head bucket access, no matter how many dentries you have. The hash
function is actively working against your cache here.
The dentries are actually more likely to fit into dcache because they
don't get artificially spread out over the cache space.
