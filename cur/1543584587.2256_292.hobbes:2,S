	Enterprise customers are beginning to see the value of having
	source available, and MS is doing this as a half-baked
	solution to give decition makers one less reason for switching
	to Open Source.
Microsoft such attempts can be viewed as either
1. Trying to make it sources open(in the long run) or
2. As you said a "half - baked solution"
	But the article mentioned about the "earlier success with the pilot
program" , which made me feel that they may have more plans than making the
sources open for a few customers.
