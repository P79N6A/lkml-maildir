more maestro updates.  the web page has most things you'll care about:
	
http://people.redhat.com/zab/maestro
the big features are the hopefull squashing of memory stomping, full
duplex sort of, and multiple /dev/dsp support.  the latter is a little
silly due to the maestro's dma restrictions, but such is life. 
some laptops might work a little btter, but I wouldn't expect
a vast improvement in supported machines out of this driver.  That
will happen next, I hope.
the SMP locking is all redone, and might vaguely approach working now :)
The thing should also be closer to building under 2.3
