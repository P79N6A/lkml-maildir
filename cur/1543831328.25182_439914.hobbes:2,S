There was a race in ondemand and conservative which made them lock up on 
resume (possibly only on SMP systems though).  There's a patch for that 
in current -mm, but I suspect there's another problem (still haven't had 
any time to track it down).
The workaround is to switch to one of the performance/powersave/user 
governors just before suspend, and restore the governor on resume.
