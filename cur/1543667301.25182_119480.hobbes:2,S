Thank you!  That'd be a god-send for those of us w/o serial 
ports and who have very cramped hands from hand-copying 
panics :-D.  Frankly, I can't imagine why something a simple 
as this isn't in the kernel.  Technically, it isn't a 
debugger, so I don't think it violates Linus' "No Kernel 
Debuggers in the Kernel" rule.
Cheers,
Nicholas
