Why? The variable isn't used anywhere I can see. If there is some hidden
use (perhaps only in SMP?), a comment would be useful.

You lost me there. AFAIKS, if this breaks with old binutils, they are just
broken way beyond hope. This just tells gcc to generate:
   movw %ax, %dx
instead of (clearly wrong!):
   movw %eax,%edx
It might be right to stay with known broken tools to not rock the boat for
a stable kernel series, but _please_ get rid of that crap for 2.4
