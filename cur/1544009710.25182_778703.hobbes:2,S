Subject: [PATCH 34/44] x86: KVM guest: sign kvmclock as paravirt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Glauber Costa <glommer@redhat.com>
Currently, we only set the KVM paravirt signature in case
of CONFIG_KVM_GUEST. However, it is possible to have it turned
off, while CONFIG_KVM_CLOCK is turned on. This is also a paravirt
case, and should be shown accordingly.
