Should the comment read "kernel->user event/get-response"

in regards to the elseif above:
Could you not have both PID and TGID passed? From my earlier
understanding it seemed legit, no? if answer is yes, then you will have
to do your sizes + reply TLVs at the end.
Also in regards to the nesting, isnt there a need for nla_nest_cancel in
case of failures to add TLVs?
cheers,
