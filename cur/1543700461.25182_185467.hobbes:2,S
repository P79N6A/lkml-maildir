If they are working, then no.

This is normal. This is because the keycodes are above 128 and that's
all that you can fit into a single signed byte.

This is also normal and can be fixed via the setkeycodes utility. The
driver cannot be preconfigured for every PS/2 keyboard out there,
because their scancodes conflict. On USB the configuration is static,
because USB carries much more information about the keys.
