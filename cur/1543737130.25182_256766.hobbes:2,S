Just one in 5 years, the one being me?  Not really Jeff.  Someplace in 
this lists archives is a squawk from me dating back maybe 2 years, 
detailing that I had to go download such and such a kernel from 
kernel.org repeatedly (I think it as 3 times, on a dialup circuit) 
before the unpack gave me a certain subdir in the tree and the -mm 
patch upchucked over missing src files it wanted to patch.  At that 
time IIRC, someone suggested I use the .gz's and I've had no further 
problems.  Whomever made the suggestion semi-indicated that what I 
was seeing wasn't unknown to the responder.  Not in so many words 
mind you, but the general tone of the message sure said it.
I also got bummed a couple of times back in the very early days of bz2 
because it beat the amiga's default .lha compression quite a bit.  
But it didn't always work.  IIRC there was a flurry of bz2 
development 2-3 years back, and maybe thats no longer true.  Me, I 
don't fix what isn't broken, so I get the .gz's only.  On dsl it 
doesn't hurt so much. :)
