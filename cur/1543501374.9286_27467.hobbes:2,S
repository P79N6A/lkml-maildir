        switch (_NSIG_WORDS) {
        default:
                memset(&set->sig[1], -1, sizeof(long)*(_NSIG_WORDS-1));
                break;
        case 2: set->sig[1] = -1;
        case 1:
        }
... seems okay to me.
   case 1: falls off the end of the switch which is legal in 'C'.
   To make this more clear. Observe:
   switch(foo)
   {
   case 0:
   case 1:
   case 2:
   default:
   }
   This is basically a NOP. Perfectly legal (and useless).
Your code might not compile because some "include" file, necessary
to make some macros in this header make sense, probably was not included.
Cheers,
