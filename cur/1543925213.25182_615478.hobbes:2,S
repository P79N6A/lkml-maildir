The procfs interface can only be used to get some debug data out from the 
driver, not to bind the driver to a CD/DVD device, so it shouldn't be a 
problem.
The other way to bind a device is to use the pktsetup program, which is 
doing ioctl calls to the driver. In that case, user space has to open the 
device before being able to do the ioctls, and the open call will increase 
the reference count.
