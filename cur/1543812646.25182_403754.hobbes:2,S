Ohh well, let's work on the assumption that it is the re-try logic first, 
then try something else if it turns out it isn't. I have no problem testing
a bunch of patches if needed.

I doubt it's POSIX ACL data : 
juhl@dragon:~/download/kernel/linux-2.6.16-rc5-mm2$ grep -i ACL .config
# CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL is not set

Ok, it's reproducible on demand (at least I've now reproduced it on 6 more
boots), so if you need any more just let me know and I'll gather a few.

Well, now is probably as good a time as any for becoming a git user, 
tracking my own patches as individual plain-text files is getting 
un-managable and as you say, bisection would be useful to be able to do.
I'll dig up some git docs and start reading.

Hmm, that patch does not apply to the 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 kernel : 
patching file drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 260 (offset 1 line).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 473.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 1394.
2 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c.rej
patching file include/linux/blkdev.h
Hunk #1 succeeded at 190 (offset 6 lines).
I'll go see if the problem also exists in mainline - will report on that 
shortly.
