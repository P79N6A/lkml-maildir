Wat this last bit added to the standard after ANSI/ISO 9899-1990?  I'm
looking through my copy and I can't find it.  All I can find is that 
in 6.3.6 Additive Operators
When an expression that has integral type is added to or subtracted from a
pointer [...] Unless both the pointer operand and the result point to
elements of the same array object [...] the behavior is undefined...
but
in 6.3.4 Cast operators
A pointer may be converted to an integral type.  The size of the integer
required and the result are implementation-defined. [...]
An arbitrary integer may be converted to a pointer.  
   ^^^^^^^^^
The result is implementation defined.
	I interpret this to mean that one MAY use integer arithmatic to
do move a pointer outside the bounds of an array.  Specifically, as soon
as I've cast the pointer to an integer, the compiler has an obligation to
forget any assumptions it makes about that pointer.  This is what casts
from pointer to integer are for!  when i say (int)p I'm saying that I
understand the address structure of the machine and I want to manipulate
the address directly.
	If the satandard has changed so this is no longer possible, there
NEEDS to be some other way in the new standard to express the same
concept, or large application domains where C is currently in use will
stop working.
