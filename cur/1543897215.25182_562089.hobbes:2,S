As long as "available for backwards compat" doesn't imply "will be deprecated 
and removed at some point in the future", then fine.
I'm not interested in the difference between class and bus.  I don't even 
really know what it is.  I'm interested in the difference between char and 
block, which is a fairly important difference if you want to actually mknod() 
anything.

So anything that's not in /sys/subsystem/block is a char device?  Is there one 
directory in which to look for char devices, or are there multiple 
directories?  (Is there a /sys/subsystem/class?  Or a /sys/subsystem/char?  
Or multiple directories I have to look at all of?)
You mentioned busses exporting device nodes.  Would these be char or block 
device nodes?

So code like mdev will need to keep using the old paths for this, or else not 
work on older kernels.

How is /sys/subsystem/{block,class} and improvement over /sys/{block,class}?  
I'm sure there _is_ a rationale for this, but I haven't actually been told 
what it is.

I was trying to read the documentation Greg posted.

There are devices in /sys/bus, but there are only symlinks in /sys/bus.  
That's very zen.
Would these devices be discoverable some other way?  Do they currently show up 
under either /sys/class or /sys/block?  If no, are they char device nodes or 
are they block device nodes?

Hmmm...
$ cd /sys/bus/usb/devices
$ ls */dev
$ ls: */dev: No such file or directory
Let me plug in my USB external hard drive...
$ ls */dev
ls: */dev: No such file or directory
Is this only in newer kernel than Ubuntu 7.04 comes with?  Am I looking wrong?

Ok.  /sys/subsystem/block is where the block devices are, all 
other /sys/subsystem/* are char devices.

So class and bus devices are NOT everything else, and therefore char devices?
I'M CONFUSED!

Actually I've been doing:
  path[]="/sys/class"
  if (path[5]=='b') is_block();
  if (path[5]=='c') is_char();
Pretty straightforward, I thought.  And it's had the added benefit of actually 
working, up until the config option to yank "old symlinks" went into the 
kernel...

After OLS I'll take a whack at updating mdev to use non-legacy paths, and tell 
you what I needed to do.
