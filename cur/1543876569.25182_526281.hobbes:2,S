Please read the thread i gave you for some details for things you ask
Have in thought that we mostly talk here about embedded devices
that run Linux in a very restricted environment where only specific
applications are allowed to exist and run, there are no user logons
and these applications need to be updated by remote once in a while
over public networks. These applications need not be tampered with
and must not be executed if they are, by someone that has hijacked
the connection by any means. Such devices can have some tamper
responsive hardware where the kernel (only) is protected in case
someone tries to tamper one of these devices by hand (not over the
network). You also need to have a centralized way of updating but
a de-centralized way of key usage so that if a person tampers with
one of these devices does not gain information that can be used
to attack the other devices over the network (like what would happened
if you used symmetric cryptography).
This is not a PC-security feature at all. Though it can be used in 
favour off
other tricks like trip-wire and digsig and others). Of course such 
functionality
could be easily by-passed in that case by someone root privileged with a 
good
understanding of the system internals.
As for Vista, no comments.... :)
