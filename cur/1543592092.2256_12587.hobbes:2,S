I can accept that, but only if there is some documentation in
drivers/char/Makefile to tell people which 6502 assembler to use and
how it should be run, preferably including the commands used by the
maintainer to generate ser_a2232fw.h.  Comment out the commands to
prevent them being used by mistake (we don't want another aic7xxx
debacle) but it should be documented.
