 Hello, Keith
 Thank you for the comment.

 It is necessary to use kernel_data field in struct module. I see.

 Certainly, I made patch for the x86 architecture. 
 However, I guessed that neither creation nor free of profiling buffer
would depend on architecture. 
 And, I had it write these processing (create_module_profile(),
delete_module_profile()) in kernel/profile.c, and call from module(). 
 Isn't this idea correct?
 If it is not correct, it is necessary to inpriment as processing of
the architecture dependence like your point it.

 It is so. Processing which specifies module from eip is corrected as
shown in the point.
