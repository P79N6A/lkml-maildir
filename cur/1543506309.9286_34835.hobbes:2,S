Hi (I hope I remembered the anti-spam To: address correctly),
I am building some hardware to allow my computer to control a mains 
appliance, and was planning to have the parallel port drive an opto-isolated 
relay. However, it occured to me that maybe it isn't possible to hold a bit 
on the parallel port high for an arbitrarily long time. If so I'd need to 
put some kind of bistable circuit into my hardware.
Can anyone tell me whether this is the case or not?
Thanks,
Adrian.
