I don't know the answer of this, but it was the usual top configuration
with very large memory model, I'm not aware of a superior config on x86
and this triggered bugs for the first time ever which could mean we were
the first ever pushing the db that far.

what is your point, that OASB is a worthless workload and the only thing
that matters is TPC-C? Maybe you should discuss your point with Oracle
not with me, since I don't know what the two benchmarks are doing
differently. TCP-C was tested too of course, but maybe not in 32G boxes,
frankly I thought OASB was harder than TCP-C, as I think Martin
mentioned too two days ago.
about the limited number of vmas per inode, that's not the case, there
were tons of vmas allocated at least a 512m SGA window per 7.5k tasks,
infact without the vma-file-merging there's no way to make that work.
But the number of vmas isn't relevant with 2.6 and remap_file_pages, so
whatever your point is, I don't see it.
