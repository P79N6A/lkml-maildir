There is a new release of the user-mode kernel available.
What's new:
A version number!  It can't be a serious project if it doesn't have a version 
number.
Shared libraries work.
It is a lot faster now that it doesn't spend 90% of its time in the context 
switching code.
I'm not distributing a canned 2.0 filesystem any more.  Since shared libraries 
work, it is now possible to use pieces of any standard distribution.  So, 
instead of the filesystem, I'm distributing a script which will construct a 
working filesystem from a Red Hat distribution.  If RH isn't your cup of tea, 
it ought to be pretty easy to make the script work off any other reasonable 
distribution.
Halting works.  Rebooting doesn't.
Caveats:
fsck will crap out if it's given a dirty filesystem.  The workaround is to 
make sure that the root filesystem is cleaned from the outside before running 
the kernel.  What appears to be the same bug occasionally crops up elsewhere 
as well.  It produces the panic "Bogus address in segv".
This version only runs on 2.2 and higher.
As always, everything is available at
