i /think/ it's this bit of code commented out in kernel/softirq.c:
        //if (!in_interrupt() && local_softirq_pending())
        //      invoke_softirq();
try to uncomment that. (this should i think do the trick on PREEMPT_RT - 
but no guarantees. It might cause problems on !PREEMPT_RT configs, i had 
to juggle around some code here. Maybe the easiest would be if you tried 
to take the new softirq.c, sans the lockdep changes. Not sure how 
feasible that is though.)
