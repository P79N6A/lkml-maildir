Its an order-of-complexity issue.  No matter how hard you try,
bitfields will -always- be tougher to optimize, than machine ints.
Bitfields are weirdly-sized, weirdly-aligned integers.  A simple look at
the generated asm from gcc on ARM or MIPS demonstrates the explosion of
code that can sometimes occur, versus a simple 'and' test of a machine
int and a mask.  x86 is a tiny bit better, but still more expensive to
do bitfields than machine ints.
