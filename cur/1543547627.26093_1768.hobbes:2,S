Far smaller companies have _already_ got away with not only violating the 
Linux kernel's GPL, but blatantly encouraging their customers to do so.
Why should we believe that anyone's actually going to pursue one as large 
as Microsoft?
See 
http://www.m-sys.com/files/drivers/doc/DOC_linux_2_2_x.zip
 for a 
binary-only driver which comes with instructions on how to link it into 
your kernel - encouraging you to break the GPL.
Note that it doesn't come as a loadable module (although it's possible to 
hack it a bit to do that). The instructions only tell you how to link it 
into your kernel - hence violating the GPL if you distribute your product.
I believe that IGEL's products are shipping with the DiskOnChip driver in 
this form. Has anyone sued them yet?
