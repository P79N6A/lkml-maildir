Hi,
First, I propose you to have a look on "Linux Kernel 2.4 Internals" from 
Tigran Aivazian. You can read it from the LDP at exact URL: 
http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lki/index.html
In this, you'll probably see that syscalls are hardcoded (file 
arch/xxx/kernel/entry.S  on your kernel tree).
This means, AFAIK, you cannot implements a syscall function in a module ;-)
One other way is using  your modules to implements char drivers and use 
ioctl() as if it was yours syscalls. This method is generally 
recommended to users who wants to implement new sayscalls.
Am I wrong?
Regards,
Matthieu
