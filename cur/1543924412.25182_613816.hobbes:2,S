Somebody pointed me to this thread in a support forum of Asustek:
http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?id=20070710054607250&board_id=1&model=M2A-VM
+HDMI
For special occasions, Asustek hand out a testing and reprogramming
utility from VIA to their customers (viafire.exe, together with EEPROM
image files and instructions; see the link to the RAR archive at this
page).  The documentation of the tool also contains a partial
description of the EEPROM contents.
