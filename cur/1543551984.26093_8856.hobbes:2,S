Well, this seems to be half the story. If I remove the close() and
let server bleed file descriptors, the RST goes away. If I add a
read() on the socket after sending all the data, the RST goes away.
However, there's NO DATA on the socket. read() returns zero until
the client closes the socket.
In the code below, I removed the shutdown() and added the block
after do_scan() to eliminate the RST. The read() never finds any data.
If there's no data pending, why does read() have any affect?
b.c.
            fcntl (data_fd, F_SETFL, 1);        /* set non-blocking */
        /*    shutdown (data_fd, 0); */
            do_scan (w, h, data_fd);
            {       
                char buff[10];
                int i, c;
                printf("looking for extra data\n");
                while ((c = read(data_fd, buff, 10)) >= 0) {
                    if (c > 0) {
                        for (i=0; i<c; ++i) {
                            printf("%x ", buff[i]); 
                        }           
                        printf("\n");
                    }           
                }           
                printf("no more data\n");
            }           
            close (data_fd);
