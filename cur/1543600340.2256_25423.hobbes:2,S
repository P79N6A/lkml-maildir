       Here is an idea i think i stole from Matthew Dillon`s paper.
    Actually it sound more like we take some pages from the near 0 
  age and swapping them out but not throwing them away, but moving them
  from active list to cache. So that we can always throw them away
  at near null cost while shrinking the cache. This is like a
  replacement for swap-cache if i`m right here...
cheers,
 Sam
