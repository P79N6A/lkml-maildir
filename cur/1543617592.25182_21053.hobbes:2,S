Here's a progy.. This SHOULD run forever. I assume malloc() works and
don't check the result --yes I already know that.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>
#define MAX_FLOAT 0x100000
int main(int args, char *argv[])
{
    unsigned int seed;   
    double *x;
    double *y;
    double *z;
    size_t i;
    x = (double *) malloc(MAX_FLOAT * sizeof(double));
    y = (double *) malloc(MAX_FLOAT * sizeof(double));
    (void) time((time_t *)&seed);
    for(;;)
    {
        srand(seed); 
        z = x;
        for(i = 0; i < MAX_FLOAT; i++)
            *z++ = cos((double) rand());
        srand(seed);
        z = y;
        for(i = 0; i < MAX_FLOAT; i++)
            *z++ = cos((double) rand());
        if(memcmp(x, y, MAX_FLOAT * sizeof(double)))
            break;
        seed = rand();
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "Floating point failure\n");
    return 1;
}

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
