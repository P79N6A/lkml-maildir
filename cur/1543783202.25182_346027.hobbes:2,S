I have responded all I am going to on this topic.  Further discussion 
will not be helpful.  The patches are provided
IAW the GPL.  Our proprietary application is just like the thousands of 
others provided on Linux, and it
does use or incorporate any GPL or Linux code.
I will not respond to any further discussion on this thread.  Thanks for 
the input.  Please feel free to read Linus
statements on kernel.org regarding the statements that applications that 
run on Linux and that use published
interfaces are unaffected by the GPL.
Thanks for your input.
Jeff
