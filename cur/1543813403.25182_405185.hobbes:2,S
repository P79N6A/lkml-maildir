Hi Darren!
	Ingo's approach is indeed orthogonal.  But the obvious approach to PI
etc is to tell the kernel who is holding the lock, by making the lock
value == TID of the holder.  If we are heading towards this anyway, the
kernel could use this to implement robust mutexes, too, although not
with a 100% guarantee (due to tid wrap).  Ingo doesn't like that,
though.
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
