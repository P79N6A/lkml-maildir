Yep! I must say I cannot resume my system from disk. The kernel always
complains about failing when trying to resume from disk. Also, after
suspending to disk, the swap partition is completely valid, and I don't
need to "mkswap" it. On previous releases of the kernel, when STD
worked, trying to skip resume from disk left the swap partition unusable
(as expected after dumping memory to the swap file).
