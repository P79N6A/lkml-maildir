Then the combined result would be a GPL'd product. You can do that now.
Add BSD code to GPL and the result comes out GPL.

The GPL says "you can use them if your final new result is GPL", the BSD
world says "Hey go do it, just say thanks". Its probably a lot simpler
to use the FreeBSD code if you don't want a GPL result.
For myself I'd be willing to discuss relicensing code in some cases but
there is little that has a single author.
