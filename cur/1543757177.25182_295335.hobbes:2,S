How do I enable DRI with my card to test that crash? I have the
following in my XF86Config:
Section "DRI"
    Group      "video"
    Mode       0660
EndSection
but nothing else about DRI. So do I have to change something in
my configuration?
Oh, and could you please include run "lspci -vv" and include the
part about VGA compatible controller in your mail? I have some
hypothesis about the settings there having to do with resume.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
