[ snipped rej file ]
These are harmless rejects that are just there because a patch snuck into
Alan's kernel that I wasn't aware was already in there.

My latest code has the number of udelay calls reduced, but it doesn't make
sense to even try and get rid of them all.  As for the one with an incorrect
comment, ignore the comment.  It's fixed in my current sources.

That should have been fixed already.  It acts as though the WIDEODD bit isn't
doing its job on your controller.

I'll have to do some more testing here to see if I can get this fixed.
[ snipped stuff about compile warnings ]
These are all in code that isn't under my control, and are harmless anyway
(even if they don't look good).
[ snipped /proc/pci list ]
The driver won't try to control the card if it isn't the right driver for the
silicon.
