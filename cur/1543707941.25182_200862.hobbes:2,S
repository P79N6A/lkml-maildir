Other than the fact it is strongly rude and error prone to depend on
the contents of a global descriptor table you did not setup?
If we did the lgdt boot_gdt before hand I don't see any problems
though.  
But at the point we could as easily do lgdt cpu_gdt_descr, and use
__KERNEL_CS which is better anyway.

That is almost nice.  Care to export where the bottom of the page
tables or even better where the bottom of the kernel is for those
folks who want to place their ramdisk as low in memory as possible?
