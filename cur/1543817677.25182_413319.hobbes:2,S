Subject: [PATCH 000 of 16] knfsd: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Groan, I missed the merge-window, but that's for new features, and this
is bug fixes...
The following 16 patches fix various bugs in the nfs server, mostly
related to NFSv4, but there are a couple that are more generally
applicable (005 in particular).
They are against 2.6.16-mm2 and should be suitable for 2.6.17-rc2.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
