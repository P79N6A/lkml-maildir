The proprietary modules where only a tiny wrapper is linux-specific and
the rest is cross-platform are in a grey area, yes.
But your modules, written specifically for linux but distributed as
binary-only, are specifically what the people choosing the GPL want to
avoid. They are a derivative work, and are, as such, illegal under the
GPL.
As stated by multiple other people, please consult a lawyer if you want
to be nasty. Or just play by the rules.
