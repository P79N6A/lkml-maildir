Oh my. How dare you! I like it. :-)

If you implement enough to run the common Windows benchmarks,
we can have loads of fun.

If this stuff isn't too insane, just make it available for all
software to use. That includes regular SPARC Linux executables, etc.
Use a regular system call without a module. I suppose you ought
to have a config option if this gets to be over 200 kB of bloat.
