When a user program wants to obtain data from a block device, there are
two ways it goes about it:
1. via read().  Read copies the data out of the kernel mapping of the
   page cache, so there's no coherency issues as far as PIO is concerned.
2. via a page which has been mmap()'d.  In this case, we are performing a
   "PIO read from device write" operation to page to fill the page cache
   with data, which must complete _before_ we hand the page to userspace.
In neither case will the page be available to the user before the PIO
operation has been completed - if it was, there would be one very big
security hole since the previous data would be visible.
Hence I find your comment "There are two cases where devices kmap a
user page into kernel space and then proceed to read from or write to
it" to be misleading - at the exact point in time that the device
driver is manipulating the data in that page, it is not a user page.

Here we fundamentally disagree - and I'm afraid that it seems that you
didn't actually read what I wrote since there's an obvious disparity
between me saying "if the page has not been mapped into userspace" and
you saying "the page is almost always mapped initially in user space" -
we're _definitely_ talking about different things here.
How can we proceed with this if this kind of misintepretation is rampant?
