send_sig_info has this code  
	/* Optimize away the signal, if it's a signal that can be
	   handled immediately (ie non-blocked and untraced) and
	   that is ignored (either explicitly or by default).  */
	if (ignored_signal(sig, t))
		goto out;
So when the signal is blocked it should never even reach the process.
