| Cool!!!
Be aware that it only works if you have not changed the Hz from the
default of 1000.

There is such a thing available if you check the archives. The only
problem with changing the min timeslice is that once you get below 10ms
you get significant cache trashing and wasted cpu cycles.

| BTW, the mentioned "sched batch kernel modification" is something else,

| Google wasn't very usefull for "sched batch"...
My staircase scheduler in 2.6.7-ck3 supports sched batch.
