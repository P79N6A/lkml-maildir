1) for details see: 
http://tapas.affenbande.org/?page_id=6.
 
2) Sending box and sending process
* periodically sends udp message using broadcast adress 192.168.2.255
* this process at RT priority FIFO (using chrt tool)
* put IRQ of network card to RT 99 FIFO prio
* box is idle (to create sort of 'stable') reference timing 
3) receiving box
* blocking read on udp socket
* put to RT FIFO 99 (chrt tool)
* process cannot be swapped out (mlockall call)
* while [1] do make -j100 && make clean; done;
* put softiqr-net-rx to RT FIFO 99 (using chrt)
* watchdog/0 not RT (i'm not sure this is mandatory)
* put IRQ of network card to RT FIFO prio 99
* Time measurement the cpu clock using gettimeofday calls

on sending box: usleep with 20000 interval (20 millisecond)
on receiving box: blocking read on udp socket

No, only usleep (maye it uses highres timers in the libs/kernel)

Not measured...

Correct. In my case the repsonsiveness is acceptable in a real time control 
system where sporadic deadline misses are acceptable. 
Thanks
