Hello,
I have a quick question and don't want to discuss the why or why not at
this point (it's been discussed to death), I'm only interested in the
facts.  Did RAID 0.90 make it into the 2.3 kernel before Linus
feature-froze it?  If not, can I saftely assume that it will not be in
the 2.4 kernel (that seems to be what he is saying)?
If the answers to those questions is "NO" and "YES" respectively, the
last question is who is the maintainer (mingo?) and will they be
releasing regular patches agains the latest 2.3 kernel and 2.4 when
that is released?
Thanks,
Fred Reimer
