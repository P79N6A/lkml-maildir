Unfortunately uidhash_lock cannot be used from a bottom half either.
You can push it into a work queue.  See schedule_work() and the default
events queue.

Yep.  Everyone architecture I know of - and certainly all that Linux
support - can do atomic read/writes to a word.  Thinking about it, it
would be odd if not (two writes to a single word interleaving?).  There
are places this assumption is used.
Anything more complicated, of course, needs atomic operations or locks.
