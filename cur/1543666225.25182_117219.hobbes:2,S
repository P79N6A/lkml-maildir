Hello
Kernel 2.5.64 with mm patches dies with "kernel panic,
killing interrupt handler" when ejecting cdrom 
(with eject /dev/hdc). 
System is duron 700 Mhz with via kt133 cipset and 
radeon ve video card. 
I didn't had time to copy the panic message but if 
you can't reproduce it (for me is 100% reproductible)
i'll send it to you. Programs and glibc are the same 
as in linux/Documentation/Changes or newer.
I'll try tomorrow to send the full Panic message to you.
Bye
Calin
