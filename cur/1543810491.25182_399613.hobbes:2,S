Add the "nosoftrepeat" parameter. This is useful if a "dumb" keyboard
has (unswitcheable) hardware repeat, like in Dell DRAC3.

Hi, Dmitry,
Dell people passed on a request to add a new parameter, "nosoftrepeat",
to i8042 (in atkbd.c). So, if I understand right, things should work so:
 - None set in grub.conf: Softrepeat is set by the driver as detected
   or derived. This is the default.
 - "softrepeat" set: Softrepeat is on, regardless
 - "nosoftrepeat" set: Softrepeat is off, regardless
 - Both "softrepeat" and "nosoftrepeat" are set: Do not do that.
The code looked confusing, but there is an good explanation in this bug:
 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=181457
In short words, DRAC3 "plugs into" the keyboard connector, but does not
emulate output, so we detect this as "dumb" keyboard and enable softrepeat.
But softrepeat causes double keypresses.
I suppose we could revamp the old softrepeat parameter to be more than
a boolean, but I see no point.
If you agree, please include the attached.
