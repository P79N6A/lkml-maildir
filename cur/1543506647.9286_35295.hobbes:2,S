Oh well, today same problem here, I've just updated my 
loadlin cmdline kernel 2.2.11 to parport=0x378,7 parport=0x278,5
before install a new lpt2 card :)
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [SPP,PS2,EPP]
parport0: no IEEE-1284 device present.
0x278: CTR: wrote 0x0c, read 0xff
0x278: DATA: wrote 0xaa, read 0xff
parport1: PC-style at 0x278, irq 5 [SPP,PS2]
parport1: no IEEE-1284 device present.
[root@home parport]# cat 0/* 1/*
MODEL:Unknown device;
MANUFACTURER:Unknown vendor;
 lp
base:   0x378
irq:    7
dma:    none

MODEL:Unknown device;
MANUFACTURER:Unknown vendor;
 lp
base:   0x278
irq:    5
dma:    none

5
[root@home parport]# insmod lp
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
lp1: using parport1 (interrupt-driven).
As you see, parport came out with some messages (*), in this
situation we can show some bad warning and maybe don't 
load parport1....
