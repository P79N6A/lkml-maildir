Christoph, my only argue against getting rid of UDF_I_* macro in
my patch is UDF coding style, I don't want to damage it. I think
we may leave it as is (including my patch). So just review the patch
I sent (second version) and Ack it then so Andrew could include it
into mm tree. Meantime I'm rewritting the whole UDF subsystem to
get rid of that macroses (it will be a long way ;)

P.S.
But if you still insist on getting rid of UDF_I_ macroses from my patch
just let me now :)
