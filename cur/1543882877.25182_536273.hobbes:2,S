The patchset used to contain lots of debugging support which wildly
duplicated thigs which we already did and was generally overdone.  That
appears to all have been cleaned up now, so thanks for doing that.
The one remaining nit I'd have with the debug code is that it adds a
private hexdump() facility.  By my count, that is the kernel's eighth
hexdump implementation.  There may be even more which don't have "hexdump"
in their name.
lib/hexdump.c is rather overdue.
