>From what I recall when we were looking into reiserfs on S/390,
the core problem was that reiserfs tried to do *atomic* operations
on non-aligned words.  This isn't supported by the hardware on
S/390 (normal non-aligned accesses just work).
I don't really see how this can be fixed in a trap handler; how
would the handler guarantee atomicity?
