C program instructions are in ASCII, data certainly isn't restricted to that.
If you or your M*A can't or won't deal with anything but plain text, then
filter it.  Plain text is clearly in the minority of emails throughout the
world and the people on LKML seem in general not to care about MIME and
frequently use it.  Let's end this offtopic thread please.
