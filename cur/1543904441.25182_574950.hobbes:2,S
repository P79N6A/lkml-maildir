That would be nice.  It'd be great if there was a per-filesystem inotify
mode.  I can't help but think it'd be more efficient than recursing
every directory and adding a watch.
Or maybe a netlink thing that could buffer events since filesystem mount
until a daemon could get around to starting, so none were lost.
