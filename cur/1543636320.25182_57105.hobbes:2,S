I'm afraid it must show that I didn't read the previous threads closely 
enough, but what is the specific benefit supposed to be, if not to address
the races?

What do you mean by single entry point?  Mount?  Register_filesystem?
Lowlevel activity on a filesystem is certainly not restricted to a single 
entry point.

It makes perfect sense for mount to be able to know which module implements 
its filesystem.  I do not see why updating every mount-like thing in the 
system is bad, if it's the best interface.
It's really hard to see why contention on a slow-path lock is anything to 
worry about.  Anyway, it's not hard to fix the locking model so the lock
only covers the transitions of state bits, instead of all of free_module.
So, I'm still hoping to hear a substantive reason why the filesystem model
can't be applied in general to all forms of modular code.  To remind you
of the issue: the proposition is that the subsystem in the module is
always capable of knowing when the module is quiescent, because it does
whatever is necessary to keep track of the users and what they're doing.
