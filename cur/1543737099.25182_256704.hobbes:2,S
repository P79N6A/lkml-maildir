In the original patch, Kenji added a dummy function in several source files. Instead now
the new patch should have a single default implementation with a __attribute__((weak))
As a result its removing all the old additions and now keeping just a single default function.
so yes, its a reverse patch mostly, but there should also be a new function added with the weak 
attribute.
