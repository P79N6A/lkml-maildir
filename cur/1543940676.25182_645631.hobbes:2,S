Oh sure, it can't avoid those. But it is free to program the controller
directly using registers instead of feeding it hardware-defined
descriptors (which are different from the dma_async_tx_descriptor
struct.) That's how I would implement support for the PDCA controller
present on the uC3 chips, which doesn't use descriptors at all.

So what you're really talking about here is framework overhead, not
hardware properties. I think this is out of scope for the DMA slave
extensions I'm proposing here; in fact, I think it's more important to
reduce overhead for memcpy transfers, which are very fast to begin
with, than slave transfers, which may be quite slow depending on the
peripheral we're talking to.
I think descriptor caching might be one possibility for reducing the
overhead of submitting new transfers, but let's talk about that later.

So basically, you're asking for maximum flexibility with minimum
overhead. I agree that should be the ultimate goal, but wouldn't it be
better to start with something more basic?

Yeah, there doesn't necessarily have to be a 1:1 mapping between
channels exported by the driver and actual physical channels. If we
allow several logical channels to be multiplexed onto one or more
physical channels, we can assign quite a few more options to the
channel instead of the transfer, reducing the overhead for submitting a
new transfer.

But devices that do flow control should work just fine with scaled-down
bus speeds. And I don't think such platform-specific tuning belongs in
the driver anyway. Platform code can use all kinds of specialized
interfaces to tweak the bus priorities and arbitration settings (which
may involve tweaking more devices than just the DMA controller...)

We should try to hide as many such quirks as possible in the DMA engine
driver, but I agree that it may not always be possible.

Not really. They had different drivers from the start. The atmel-mci
driver existed long before I was allowed to even mention the name
"AVR32" to anyone outside Atmel (or even most people inside Atmel.) And
at that point, the at91_mci driver was in pretty poor shape (don't
remember if it even existed at all), so I decided to write my own.
The PDC is somewhat special since its register interface is layered on
top of the peripheral's register interface. So I don't think we'll see
a DMA engine driver for the PDC.

See? The DMA engine framework doesn't even support all forms of memcpy
transfers yet. Why not get some basic DMA slave functionality in place
first and take it from there?

Yes, but I think we should at least _try_ to avoid them as much as
possible. I'm not aiming for "perfect", I'm aiming for "better than
what we have now".

Why? It doesn't have to be expensive, and we already have "core plus
standard subclasses"; you're arguing for adding "plus SOC-specific
subclasses". I would like to make the async_tx-specific stuff a
"standard subclass" too at some point.

Right. I'll add a "unsigned int engine_type" field so that engine
drivers can go ahead and extend the standard dma_device structure.
Maybe we should add a "void *platform_data" field to the dma_slave
struct as well so that platforms can pass arbitrary platform-specific
information to the DMA controller driver?
