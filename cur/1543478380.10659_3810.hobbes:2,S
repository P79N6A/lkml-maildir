Hi Michael.

 > kernel-related software.
 > I found "linux-config" on vger, but it seems to be about sound card

 > If there is already such a list, can you point me to it?
I'm not aware of one...

I'd be willing to host it for you, but it'll take me a few days to get
it set up...
Best wishes from Riley.
