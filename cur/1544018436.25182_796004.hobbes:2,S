I'm running on 2.6.24.3 right now which is irrelevent.  Is your system
x86_64 capable?  This specific machine is not.  It's an older dual xeon 533mhz
fsb.

lshw IIRC uses dmi information to obtain that information.

# grep HIGH .config

I see no reason not to use highmem 64gb  I've used it on several of my
systems, even ones that can't handle more than 2gb w/o problems.
One thing I have noticed (which is irrelevent to your question) is that I
see about 100mb less memory running a 64-bit kernel vs a 32-bit kernel on 2
systems (different brand of motherboard) and 4gb.  One was upgraded to 8gb;
32-bit shows about 8400000kb memory and running 64-bit shows about 8200000kb
memory.  Noone has answered my question as to why that is.
