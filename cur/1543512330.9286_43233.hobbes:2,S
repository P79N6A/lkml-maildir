  AFAIK, this message is harmless. It's due to a bug in the read ahead code,
(Davem, correct me if I'm wrong) which try to read beyond the end of a file.
This problem is general to every filesystems, but isofs is the only one I know
which complains about this.
If these messages bug you, you can comment out the printk which generate it 
in linux/fs/isofs/inode.c (search for _iso_bmap).
This is not a fix, it just hide the symptoms, but as long it's the only
symptom so far, you can just hide it :)
