Interesting, I can't remember you sending me any
patches...
Also, the 2.4 VM (unlike the other VMs) doesn't actually
FREE memory wrongly (with the exception of buffer cache
pages from page_launder()) but just moves it to the
inactive_clean list, from where it will be re-used by one
of those 99% user level allocations that happen on a typical
Linux system.
But, as I said in Ottawa, I wouldn't mind any classzone
stuff in the new VM, as long as it won't complicate the
integration of _other_ memory organisations (like NUMA).
regards,
Rik
