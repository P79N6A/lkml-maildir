Hi, Igno.
I've tested my case with gentoo kernel 2.6.20-r9(2.6.20.14+some gentoo
patches) and sound still interrupting ...
I've attached config.
Is it possible that my hardware became broken?
I really don't remember the kernel version when sound hadn't been
interrupting. It's possible that everything was alright with 2.6.20
I'll try to test alsa subsytem.
Best wishes,
Dima.
