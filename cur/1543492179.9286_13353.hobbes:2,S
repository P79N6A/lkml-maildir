Well, gee!  I kind of find myself in agreement with this.  I personally am
running RedHat, but I also ran Debian, and long ago slackware and SLS.  What
about if the maintainers of a particular module included make options to
make the appropriate package type, but still deliver them in tar.gz format?
In other words, the could have been a rpm make target that would make the
appropriate rpm.  There could also have been a srcrpm make target to make a
source rpm, or a deb make target to make a Debian package, etc.  That way,
for those who wanted to use rpm's or deb's or whatever, all they would have
to do is untar it and then run one make command to get the package type of
their choice.  Those who don't use packages can happily ignore the extra
cruft that is included for package users...
Good idea?
