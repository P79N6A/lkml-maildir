Andrew,
	Here's a trivial patch to add PC Bios support by default when
activating Advanced Partition Selection e.g. when someone wants to add
LDM he doens't have potentially vital feature removed which can be very
annoying indeed (especially when you preconize an option to be an
upvalue) :(
Regards,
FabF

 	  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
 	  were partitioned on an x86 PC (not necessarily by DOS).
