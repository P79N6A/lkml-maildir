honestly, I think if you're contemplating this kind of thing, you've
gone too far with the design.  it should be dirt friggin simple', like
what wli posted a while ago with struct list.  if you need more, you
really should just use list_head and be done with it.  (restartable list
walking?  why did you stop walking in the first place?  oh, you didn't
mean restartable, you meant able to start walking at an arbitrary
position?  back to list_head.. )
Here's something I'd consider using if it were in the kernel.  if others
agree, I can finalize and submit it.
( yeah, a lot of it is stinky, like the requirement that users magically
have the right member in their structs.  I have no deep love for the
interface.  at least this passes basic usage tests..)
