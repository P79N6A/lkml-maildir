Ugh. That setting is VERY BAD. Just a quick test without
doing anything complex...
  # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog
  # ping dws7
  PING dws7 (192.52.215.17) 56(84) bytes of data.
[so the DNS lookup worked]
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=0 Destination Host Unreachable
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
  ...
[NOTE - these are plugged into the same 10/100 Ethernet switch]
  # echo 8 > /proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog
  # ping dws7
  PING dws7 (192.52.215.17) 56(84) bytes of data.
[so the DNS lookup worked]
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=2210 ms
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1210 ms
  From dws77... (192.52.215.87) icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=210 ms

I tried again with 2, 3, and 4. Two appears to be "way too small" with
a ping of 1000 ms and nominal values of 0.800 ms. Three does not appear
to be good either with nominal values of 0.500 ms. Four has similar
results to eight (8).
