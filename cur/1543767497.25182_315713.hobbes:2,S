RAID does stripe sized rewrites so you get into the same situation as
with actual disks - a physical media failure might lose you old data
(but then if the disk goes bang so does the data...)

Benchmark it - it depends on your workload I imagine. If you are able to
write a log entry well before it is needed then the fsync can be a big
win because you can hope the data is already on or heading for disk when
you fsync

If you are trying to write logs on that kind of simplistic "reliable"
approach then you probably want a raid card with battery backed ram, at
that point fsync becomes very fast. Most transaction services tend to
use different algorithms to provide reliable service due to exactly
these kind of reasons.
