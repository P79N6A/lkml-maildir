We have a written a little LD_PRELOAD library which intercepts fork()
et. al. and migrates the task to a different cpu, pins itself to only
that cpu, then does the user requested call, upon return from the call,
the task is migrated back to the original cpu and the original allowed
cpus is restored.  With that library, we find a few advantages, mainly,
the task_struct and page tables are allocated node local to the task.
As long as the task does not change its allowed cpus mask, they are also
freed on the same cpu which allocated them.
Thanks,
Robin
