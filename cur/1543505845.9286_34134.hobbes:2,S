The SYM53C895 chip only implements 128 bytes of IO registers. The upper
128 bytes of the IO window just map the same registers as the lower 128
bytes. Without any concept of resource allocation, it did not seem this
usefull to care about more than 128 bytes of IO registers. Now, we
probably should want to care about the full 256 bytes IO window for this
chip.
