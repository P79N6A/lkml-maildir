Hmm, you have managed to load the 8390 module?
I have an SMC-ultra card and the kernel firmly (but politely)
refuses to even load the driver :(
mirkwood:/usr/src/linux# modprobe smc-ultra
/lib/modules/2.1.131/net/smc-ultra.o: init_module: Device or resource
busy
mirkwood:/usr/src/linux# tail -3 /etc/modules.conf
# Options
options sb io=0x220 irq=9 dma=0 dma16=5
options smc-ultra io=0x300 irq=10
No messages whatsoever have been handed over to syslog
and io 0x300 and irq 10 are not in use yet...
This is the first time I am going to set up a network
myself, so I could use a bit easy-going driver stuff :)
(I have set up a null-modem PPP link however and have
installed part of a Linux system over it. The next step
is a headless install over PPP :)
As soon as I succeed I will make available a tarball of
the rootfloppy I use to do this...
cheers,
