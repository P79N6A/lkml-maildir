Yes. Currently VMware's & mine code is identical except that mine
vmmon supports all released products since VMware 2.0.0 through VMware 
express, GSX & so on up to the VMware 4.0.2, while VMware's code supports 
only product it is shipped with. And you need C++ (for templates which are
used for generating code for different product versions) with mine code,
while you get one unwind template instance from VMware.

If this patch is for vmmon, can you share it with VMware (or with me
and I'll then share it with VMware) ? I cannot explain why ACPI does 
not notice that kernel is spending about 99% of time in the kernel, 
being very busy with hard work...
