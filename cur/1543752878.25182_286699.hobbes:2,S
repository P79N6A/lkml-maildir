But my hardware has the buffers on chip, if connected directly to each other.
So no system level buffering is needed.

Here we agree already, so lets talk about the rest.

That sounds really close to what I want.
Now imagine this (ACSCII art in monospace font):
[ chip A ] ------(1)------ [ chip B ]   [ CPU ]   [memory]  [disk]
      |                        |           |         |        |
      +----------(2)-----------+---(2)-----+----(2)--+--------+
(1) Is a direct path between these chips.
(2) Is the system bus (e.g. PCI)
(1) works without any CPU intervention
(2) needs the buffering scheme you described.
I like to use (1) for obvious reasons, but still allow (2).
User space should decide which one, since it's a policy decision.
I need to open the chips with default to (2), because the driver
doesn't know in advance, that it will be connected to a chip it can talk to 
directly. Everything else will be quite ugly.
Please note, that this is a simplified case and we actually have many chips of
A/B and (1) is more like a software programmable "patch field" you
might know from a server rack. I want user space to operate this "patch 
field".
Maybe "io router" is a descriptive term. No?

Yes, I understand and support your vision. Now I would like to use path (1)
the direct for this. Possible? 
Maybe by making drivers optionally aware of splice() and defaulting to a 
regular pipe, if they don't care?
