as said in a part of a previous email might_sleep() just like BUG() can
be defined to noop.
cond_resched() is the API to use.
if you're scared that there are too many cond_resched (I'm not scared
and people should enable them anyways if they make a difference, they
still should be less than the number of spin_unlocks with preempt
enabled), then you should add a cond_resched_costly and add a config
option that turns it off. I think you don't even need to add the config
option, you can define cond_resched_costly as cond_resched, and to just
use it to mark the places that might be expensive.
Then you should change cond_resched to call might_sleep in the else
branch (as I discussed with Andrew last month).
this was the core of the patch I was playing with last month which
should be still valid and it solves the preprocessor issues with
cond_resched (and I hope the bug was not in the below code ;)
could you modify your patch accordingly? thanks!
