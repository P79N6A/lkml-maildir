exactly, that's the difference.

there's not a single page of difference.

are you kidding? burnt space in the algorithm? the burnt space is to
move the thing in kswapd, period. that global variable and message
passing protocol between the task context and kswapd is the total waste.
There's no waste at all in moving the oom killer up the stack to
alloc_pages and in the future up outside alloc_pages with some more
higher level API.
