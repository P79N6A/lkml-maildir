1st, it's not Bill Gates, but someone in his company.
2nd, if he said "Microsoft can commit suicide any time, Linux can't"
would you commit suicide just to prove him wrong ?

PS: no, I'm not necessarily opposed to innovation in FS semantics, but
    I still haven't come across any compelling example where forks would
    provide anything new.  Better support for tiny files (like 32bits long)
    sounds good to me, but I see no reason to really change the basic
    semantics.  In any case, all this `fork' stuff has been way too hazy.
    Some people tried to propose a rough `user-level forks' implementation
    description so as to allow constructive criticism, but I still haven't
    seen any serious description of what `kernel-level fork support' is
    supposed to look like.  You say you're ready for coding, so you must know
    what you want to code.  What is it going to be ?
    If it's just better support for tiny dirs and files (with attribute
    inheritance, for example (plus, at worst, a little bit of hint from the
    application)), I'm all for it.
