Ewww, you're right.  As I believe I already mentioned, this is why I
was originally opposed to mixing lvm and md into one directory.  Not
that this was a valid objection, of course.
The easy fix would be to unconditionally enter the directory.  But
let's do better, shall we?

Here's the best I can come up with.  Completely untested.  Yes, it's
ugly.  So are the alternatives.  The version with temp variables came
out to 21 lines.  Comments?
  ##### [ drivers/Config.in ] #####
  # enter dir for kernel case if MD==y or LVM==y
  ifneq($(findstring y,$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD) $(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM)),)
    SUB_DIRS += md
  endif
  # enter dir for module case if MD==y or MD==m or LVM==m
  ifneq($(findstring m,$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD) $(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM)),)
    MOD_SUB_DIRS += md
  else
    ifeq($(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD),y)
      MOD_SUB_DIRS += md
    endif
  endif
