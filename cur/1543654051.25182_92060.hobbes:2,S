Subject: 2.5.49: compile with CONFIG_NET=n still broken

[I haven't tried to compile without CONFIG_NET for a while, so I suppose
 this probably crept in earlier.]
With CONFIG_NET=n, I get two link errors:
  	v850e-elf-ld  -T arch/v850/vmlinux.lds.s arch/v850/kernel/head.o arch/v850/kernel/init_task.o  init/built-in.o --start-group  usr/built-in.o  arch/v850/kernel/built-in.o  kernel/built-in.o  mm/built-in.o  fs/built-in.o  ipc/built-in.o  security/built-in.o  crypto/built-in.o  lib/lib.a  arch/v850/lib/lib.a  drivers/built-in.o  sound/built-in.o  net/built-in.o --end-group  -o vmlinux

make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
(1) The `dev_ioctl' error is because of the added call in sock_ioctl
    (net/socket.c) to dev_ioctl #ifdefed on WIRELESS_EXT, which is defined
    in <linux/wireless.h>.  Since net/socket.c actually includes
    <linux/wireless.h> twice, once #ifdefed, and once not, I just got rid
    of the non-#ifdefed include, which seems to solve the problem:

(2) `__secpath_destroy' is used by the inline function `secpath_put',
    in <net/xfrm.h>, and net/core/skbuff.c calls secpath_put -- but
    __secpath_destroy is defined in net/ipv4/xfrm_input.c, and the
    net/ipv4 directory isn't even compiled if CONFIG_NET=n.
    [I didn't know what to do about this, so I just commented out the call
    to __secpath_destroy in secpath_put]
Thanks,
