Hi all.
I have a clients laptop (above) and acpi seems to be broken. It is running Suse 8.2. There is a guide for all this at 
http://www.shroom.com/linux/laptop/8000.html
But it is for a 2.2 kernel.
The main error is from acpi saying "Cannot allocate resource region"
My question is: Has acpi been changed alot since then, as the kernel is not picking up the sound card and modem. I have traced this to acpi, as the only way I can get into the machine without pcmcia hanging to by putting pci=noacpi in grub.
Both are supported, but lspci -vv doesn't show them as acpi is off.
Am I correct is thinking that without acpi they will not be detected?
I have tried 2.6.0-test and 2.4.22 with this same error. Have not tired a 2.2 kernel on it.
