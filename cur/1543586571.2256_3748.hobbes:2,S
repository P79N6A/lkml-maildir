And _that_ approach is the reason why I absolutely refuse to run your code
on any of my boxen.  Sorry.  If devfs (without serious cleanup) will become
mandatory I'll fork the tree - better backporting patches to Linus' one than
depending on current devfs.  You've been sitting on known (and easily fixable)
bugs and asking to leave fixing them to you for what, 10 months already?
Furrfu...  You are maintainer of that code.  You keep insisting on having
everything and a kitchen sink in the devfs and refuse to split the
functionality into reasonable pieces.  Essentially you are saying that it's
all or nothing deal.  Fine with me - out of these options I certainly
prefer the latter.
