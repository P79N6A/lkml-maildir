umm..  I'd say what you've done in there is an improvement to the exiting
stuff: getting gcc to check it is better than having to use sparse.
I'd have expected gcc to generate poorer code with your approach but I'm
showing zero text size changes from Christoph's patch (gcc-4.1 and
gcc-3.4.5).
So I wouldn't be averse to creating a new, generic, kernel-wide alternative
to the existing __be32/__le32/etc code.  It is an improvement.
But I don't think we want driver-private implementations.
We could conceivably simply switch the existing stuff to use structs, but
quite a lot of code assumes that cpu_to_foo32(0) == 0 and just does
open-coded assigments of zero.  They'd need fixups.
