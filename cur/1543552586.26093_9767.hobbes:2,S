Yes, that is just working right.

Right.
2.4.0-test10-pre4 is also buggy because it doesn't check for O_LARGEFILE while
reading and writing (it should return EOVERFLOW from read and EBIG during
writes).
2.2.18pre17aa1 allows anybody to open a file larger than 2G (that seems not to
be completly in sync with the specs) but it has all the necessary runtime
checks during read/write. Just search for O_LARGEFILE in the lfs patch. That
needs to be forward ported to 2.4.x.
