Hi Darrick:
Sorry this took forever for me to review.  Just a few little things...

Documentation/hwmon/adt7473 would be nice.

That should be const.

Given ADT7473_PWM_BHVR_SHIFT is 5, this BUG() is obviously impossible.
But I guess it's not obvious to GCC.

NACK on that comment and associated code:  Jean Delvare submitted a
patch to NVIDIA over two years ago to fix their bug.  Apparently some
distros even carry his patch.  So, I don't want to encourage such a
hack to persist.  Please just do the standard check here.
