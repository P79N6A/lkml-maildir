If you don't have reschedule point in your equivalent of shrink_mmap and this
1.5G will happen to be consecutive in the lru order (quite probably if it's
been pagedin at fast rate) then you may even hang in interruptible mode for
seconds as soon as somebody start reading from disk. 2.4.x have to scale for
dozen of Giga of RAM as there are archs supporting that amount of RAM.

So I can't read more than the size that the fs cache can take? I must be
allowed to do that (they're 200 Mbyte of RAM that can be more than enough
if the server mainly generate pollution anyway).
