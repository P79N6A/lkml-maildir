Thank you very much for your reply!
The problem is, I want to do all these stuff in kernel space. More 
specifically,  I want to use them in a newbie kernel module. In this 
module, I wanna do something with a raw block device (with no 
filesystem).  Below are some more questions regarding to your comments.  
Really appreciate your help!

This gets recorded in the superblock of the device. You can see what blocksize a device is using by running the tune2fs command with the deivce as an argument.

>Reading and writing a block on a device in userspace is as simple as opening the device, lseeking to the block in question and doing a read or write. Keep in mind that the filesystem blocksize has nothing to do with the blocksize for the device. The sector size for most block devices is 512 bytes. This means that the unit in which we can communicate with the device is 512bytes. However, the filesystem driver will have it own unit i.e, the blocksize. Hence, usually many sectors will fall in a block. The blocks are held in the buffer cache.The filesystem block size should be a power of 2 and less than the pagesize.

Isn't there a bwrite similar to bread?
