This is of course a kernel bug - but it could be easily fixed.
My scg driver for SunOS requires write permissions since it has been
created in August 1986.

So changing the kernel to require write permissions would be a simple fix that
would help without breaking cdrtools as libscg of course opens the devices with 
O_RDWR.
I am not against a long term change that would require euid root too, but this 
should be announced early enough to allow prominent users of the interface to 
keep track of the interface changes.
BTW: the currely used errno EACCESS applies to file permissions while EPERM
applies to process permissions. So EPERM would be a more appropriate errno 
value.
