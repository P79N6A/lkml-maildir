Not to put words in anyones mouth, but the rejection is mainly based on
the concept of stuffing acpi directly into the SCSI core where it
clearly doesn't belong. I don't think anyone is against utilizing ACPI
(if useful/required) for suspend+resume as a concept, even if lots of
people have reservations on ACPI in generel.
