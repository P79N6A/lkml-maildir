Well, the way I do it on ppc64 works with failure cases too. The IO
layer is given my phusical limitations, that is it provides me with an
SG list that will always fit. If I can do merging, great, that will
improve, but I don't enforce merging.
You could do exactly the same.
The problem I agree is that this forces the IO layer to give you small
enough requests, it would be nice to have a "try big and retry smaller"
path but that require invasive changes.
