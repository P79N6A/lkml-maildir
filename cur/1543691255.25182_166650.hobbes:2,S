It was mainly to show that the patch is a better solution than what currently
is in the kernel.

Probably because of the two __get_user in is_prefetch. I suspect their exception
tables get accounted to data.

None at all. The test did not measure prefetch performance, but just
how much overhead is_prefetch adds to the page fault path. 
AFAIK there is no prefetch in the  do_page_fault -> fail to find vma -> signal delivery
path.
As for measuring prefetch I'm not sure it makes sense. It depends a lot
on how fast your memory is, how thrashed your caches are, how many
CPUs you have (e.g. on Opteron memory latency varies based on the
number of CPUs) etc. So even if it isn't a win on some system
it can help on others.

Maybe. But that would be really a separate thing. even with prefetch completely
removed from the kernel we would still need a workaround for user space.
