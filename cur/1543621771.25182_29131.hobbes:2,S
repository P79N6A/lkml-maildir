Btw, _please_ don't do things like changing the bitkeeper etc/config file.
Right now your very first changesets is something that I definitely do not
want in my tree.
Sure, I can do "bk cset -x" on the damn thing, but the fact is, I don't
want to have totally unnecessary undo's in my tree on things like this.
That's just stupid, and only makes the revision history look even less
readable than it already is..
