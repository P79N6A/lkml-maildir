You understand wrong.  /dev/pts was constructed because the semantics
of BSD pty's is broken (there are issues with permissions.)

You should fix your applications.

Absolutely not.  BSD and Unix98 ptys have different semantics, and
absolutely, positively, must be kept separate -- or you have a
security hole in your machine.
Fix your old applications.
