What I just submitted doesn't include the snapshot target as yet, I
want people to focus on the dm core rather than getting side tracked
by one of the targets.

For the last few months all snapshot io has been going through kcopyd,
*except* the snapshot metadata update (which did use a kiobuf).  I
have a patch which sends the metadata through kcopyd in the works, so
when I submit the snapshot target it will not use a kiobuf - I'm no
fan of kiobufs.
