Problem is, what happens if vendor X ships a feature and that feature is
deemed unacceptable for the kernel.org kernel?
There are examples of this and as I've earlier indicated, I'd be OK with
merging some fairly stinky things after 2.7 forks off, as a service to the
major kernel.org customers and as a general lets-keep-things-in-sync
exercise.
But we then need to do it all again in 2.8.x.  It's hard to see how to fix
this apart from either merging everything into the main tree or dropping
things from vendor trees.  Or waiting for someone to come up with an
acceptable form of whatever it is the patch does.
