You need to look at the kernel messages - normally you'll find an
"oops" in there when this happens.  If the dump doesn't contain
symbolic information (ie, the function names) you'll need to pass
it though ksymoops to decode it (using the correct System.map file
for the kernel which generated the dump.)
If you do use ksymoops, be sure to include the original oops dump -
ksymoops appears to drop some lines from the oops dump.
