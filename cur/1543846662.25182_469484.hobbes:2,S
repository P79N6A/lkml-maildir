delta IRQ == 263
delta LOC == 3
That explains the problem. The lapic frequency seems to be way off. I
have no good idea offhand how to detect such lapic brokeness.

It brings update_process_times() back into IRQ0. On systems with a
working lapic, it would not matter. SMP moves update_process_times() to
lapic too. That's why I asked whether a SMP=y kernel has the same
problems on this box.
