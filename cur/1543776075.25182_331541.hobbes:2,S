OK, I can see the whitespace changes now, but please don't send patches
in any kind of zip format, it makes them impossible for someone to review
and comment on them.  Attachments are allowed (or tolerated) if they
are of type text/plain so that an email client can display them
inline with the rest of the mail message.
