I was saving that for later, but if people want it and Linus doesn't mind
adding new features... why not.

Sorry to say so, but although this works, I don't think it is flexible
enough. I really would like to have a dynamic mapping between host ->
documentroot. Having said that, this system is a good start... (So unless
anyone comes up with a better one, this is it for now)

That can be done easily. I'll send you a patch for this later today.

I'll check your code soon and add the IP-mode thing. 
One question to l-k/Linus: Is the feature-freeze in effect or can something
like this be added to the kernel?
