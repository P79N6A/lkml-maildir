If that is the last object in the slab then the page is deslabified and 
it will stick around as a regular page until its refcount reaches zero.
There is slab functionality in SLUB that uses this trick to insure that 
the slab does not go away.

You can bump the slab page count. But you have to use virt_to_head_page() 
instead of virt_to_page() since slab pages may be compound pages (in both 
SLAB and SLUB). Incrementing the refcount of a tail page will cause an oops on
free.

If you kfree the object then all slab allocators will feel free to 
immediately alloc the object for other purposes.
If you want to prohibit further allocations from a slab then I can likely 
give you a function call that removes a slab from the partial lists so 
that the slab will not be allocated from. But this will only work with 
SLUB.
At some point the slab will then need to be returned to the partial slab 
lists.
Hmmmm... Maybe we are creating more of a mess with this. Isnt there some 
other way to handle these object.
