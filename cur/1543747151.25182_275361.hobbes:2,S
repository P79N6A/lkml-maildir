This ifdef is not needed.

Please use a __bitwise marker for your enum so that sparse will check
for improper usage of it.

Not needed (see the recent thread on lkml for why).

Why not use the kernel list structures here instead?

Why have 2 different sections in the same header file for this check?
Please put them all together.

Make these static inlines to get the compiler to check the arguments
properly.

Should this really be here?

No changelogs in files please.

Looks like it's unused to me :)
Use pr_debug() if you want debugging stuff, don't make up your own...
