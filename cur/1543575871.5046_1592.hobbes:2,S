   The oops looks something like this. It was caught on serial
   console, and decoded on test11, so it doesn't have translation for
   module symbols. It if helps, this box is running ip_conntrack and
   the oops occurred basically as soon as an NFS request came in.
If you turn off netfilter, ip_conntrack, etc. does the OOPS still
occur?
