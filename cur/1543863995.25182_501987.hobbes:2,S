I don't really understand what you are trying to say here. The overhead
of running in RAW1394_DMA_PACKET_PER_BUFFER mode is only acceptable for
very small buffer sizes. Usually one packet consists of 8 to 32 frames
(depending on the framerate of the stream), a frame being one sample of
all audio channels.
Currently I prefer about 4 interrupts per period, as we need some slack
to cope with the variable amount of no-data packets. So the
RAW1394_DMA_PACKET_PER_BUFFER mode is needed only for buffer sizes of 32
frames (assuming 8 frames per packet). Higher buffer sizes should use
another mode, because otherwise we're burning CPU cycles for no good
reason (12% cpu load is a little too high for me). The most frequently
used buffer sizes are around 128 frames, so that would mean 16
interrupts per period (4 times too much).
The way I currently solve this is by using the BUFFERFILL mode, but I 
inform the kernel that I expect packets that are larger than what I will 
effectively receive. If you specify a max_packet_size of 4096/4 bytes, 
every 4 packets the DMA buffer will be full and an interrupt will be 
generated. Internally it's called buff_stride if I'm not mistaking.
But again, what exactly is your point in this message?
