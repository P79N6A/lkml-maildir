No, they don't. They simply state that *you* may obtain the right to
modify/distribute the work from either license at your option. They do not
say anything about relicensing. Again, such an agreement would have to be in
writing.
What license a distributor uses to acquire the rights to modify or
distribute a work has no effect whatsoever on the rights the recipient has
to the work. The GPL is absolutely clear about this (section 6).
