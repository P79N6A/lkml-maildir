Please don't do this!
Yeah the kernel will boot but the hd performance is sh*t on my laptop. I 
am running FC6 with
kernel 2.6.21 and without the combined_mode setting my disk performance 
goes down to a
whopping 1.25mb/sec from 44mb/sec when I boot with combined_mode=libata. 
It make my
system unusable!

Steve
