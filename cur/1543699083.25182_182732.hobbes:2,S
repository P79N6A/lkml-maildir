Great. seems to work very well. Thx.
Ran some very hungry testprogs (memeat.c), filled a tmpfs with crap, ... 
I was satisfied with oom's kill decisions.
And it is/was very easy to modify/extend oom_kill.c  for special needs.
Maybe the Configure.help text should be somewhat more frightening.
I think aa had good reasons for disabling oom (possibility of lock up) but
among others 
I'd prefer to see your patch - a config option (default disabled +
experimental)  - in 2.4.24.
Cheers,
Pet
