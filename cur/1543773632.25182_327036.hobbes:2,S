ebtables doesn't have all the targets/matches that iptables has.
Perhaps a rule structure using marking can always be used so that the
ACCEPT/DROP can be deferred until inside ebtables, I don't know if that
will always be possible though.
Deferring the hooks makes the bridge-nf code alot more complicated, so I
would be glad to get rid of it if it is the right thing to do. But
backwards compatibility can't be maintained and I'd be surprised if
every ruleset that now works will still be possible using an
iptables/ebtables scheme.
It has worked fine in the past and I see no reason why to stop making it
work now because of some recently found and unrelated referencing
problem.
Of course, if the netfilter people decide it should be removed, then so
be it.
cheers,
Bart
