Yes For KerberosV this seems to be the case, but from the 'README' file:
krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.Z is the cryptographic library source.  It may be
        export restricted.
krb5-1.0.src.tar.Z is the source tree.  It may be export restricted.  It
        is your responsibility obtain an export license if necessary.
        Not that the source code does not include the cryptographic
        library source.  Both tar files should be untarred in the same
        place to produce the full source tree.
Perhaps somebody from MIT could clarify this, but my understanding has
been that KerberosIV was exported by stripping out the encryption
stuff (but leaving the hooks) and then exporting the 'Bones'. Thus you
have efforts such as the ftp.pdc.kth.se:/pub/krb/src which have taken
Bones and added the encryption back in.
Recently, people have discovered a loophole in the US regulations. You
can apparently perfectly legally export encryption software in paper
form (this is what was done for pgp-5.0 and pgp-6.0 (see
http://www.pgpi.com/faq/pgpi.shtml#Why
). Perhaps this is what has been
done for KerberosV?
Cheers,
