This is incorrect and misleading.  The *KERNEL* has bugs that
require an older gcc.  Red Hat 7.0 includes an older gcc called
"kgcc" in order to compile kernels.

Which is irrelevant since Red Hat 7 includes kgcc which is
intended for kernel builds.

[Mike A. Harris Linux tip #1 - 50 line mode]
Is the 80x25 line screen too small for you?  If you want more screen real
estate, you can set 50 column mode by editing your /etc/lilo.conf file, and 
adding a new line with "vga=ext" to the global section near the top.  Save
and exit, then run "lilo".  Next time you boot, you'll have a nice big 80x50 
screen.
