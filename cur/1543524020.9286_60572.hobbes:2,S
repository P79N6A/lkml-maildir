Same patch, updated. (still just cleans up file_operations struct
initializations)
Changes:
	- updated to 2.3.41
	- cleaned up instances of leading spaces rather than tabs
	- removed some benign garbage added the first time
	- removed the 3 files from patch that were accepted
	  (arch/i386/kernel/apm.c, drivers/pci/proc.c, fs/udf/file.c)
	- file count is now down from 171 to 168 :)
	- 2429 LOC deleted - 980 LOC added = 1449 less kernel LOC
