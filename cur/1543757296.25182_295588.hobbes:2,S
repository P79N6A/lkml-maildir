I can't see your point ... you mean there is a problem that when 
kbd->kbdmode == VC_UNICODE, then control will not reach the 
"if (dead_key_next)"?
I don't think this is a problem. You have type a really strange sequence
of keypresses -- sth like: <a dead key><Compose> <a letter> in Unicode
mode ... then the behaviour would slightly differ from today's one. 
If you think this is worth fixing, I can do it.

Ok, it's not needed, because it would have been done automatically, as 
diacr and value are both unsigned chars. But at least we can clearly see
what's happening.

You only want to transport more bits when handling a dead key. If the
put_queue at the end of the function was simply replaced by to_utf8, you
would modify the behaviour of normal KT_LATIN keys with value > 127;
Somebody may be rely on the current meaning.
