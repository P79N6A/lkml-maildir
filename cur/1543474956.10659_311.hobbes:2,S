Sometimes hard discs screw up (that is why do backups and RAID if you care 
about your data), sometimes network cable/gateways/systems corrupt packets.
Given the current state of cheap computer hardware and cables it is surprising
that it only happens with a few ISPs. In short: computer networks are 
unreliable, bit errors are nothing uncommon even for end2end networks
that have other checksums and you have to accept that sometimes a packet
gets mangled. That is why TCP has a end2end checksum. 
All standards say that packets with wrong checksum should be silently dropped,
2.2 will do that and turn off that debugging, I repeat, debugging message.
