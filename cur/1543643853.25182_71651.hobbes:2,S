Hi,
this has happend ever since with JFS filesystem. I am trying to do sofware
suspend with "echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep".
The following errors are reported:
Stopping tasks: ========================
 stopping tasks failed (3 tasks remaining)
Suspend failed: Not all processes stopped!
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, jfsIO not stopped
 Strange, jfsCommit not stopped
 Strange, jfsSync not stopped
 done
When I reported this first a whole while ago, someone said JFS still somehow
lacks support for software suspend.
# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
CONFIG_JFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_JFS_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_JFS_STATISTICS is not set
Best regards,
Axel
