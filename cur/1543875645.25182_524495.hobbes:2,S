Subject: [PATCH 6/6] UML - Fix LVM crash
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/27/208

From: Jason Lunz <lunz@falooley.org>
Permit lvm to create logical volumes without crashing UML.
When device-mapper's DM_DEV_CREATE_CMD ioctl is called to create a new
device, dev_create()->dm_create()->alloc_dev()->
blk_queue_bounce_limit(md->queue, BLK_BOUNCE_ANY) is called.
blk_queue_bounce_limit(BLK_BOUNCE_ANY) calls init_emergency_isa_pool()
if blk_max_pfn < blk_max_low_pfn. This is the case on UML, but
init_emergency_isa_pool() hits BUG_ON(!isa_page_pool) because there
doesn't seem to be a dma zone on UML for mempool_create() to allocate
from.
Most architectures seem to have max_low_pfn == max_pfn, but UML doesn't
because of the uml_reserved chunk it keeps for itself. From what I can
see, max_pfn and max_low_pfn don't get much use after the
bootmem-allocator stops being used anyway, except that they initialize
the block layer's blk_max_low_pfn/blk_max_pfn.
This ensures init_emergency_isa_pool() doesn't crash uml in this
situation by setting max_low_pfn == max_pfn in mem_init().
