Given the way that "make -j" behaves, I'm surprised it was only inetd
that crashed.  From the make(1) manpage:
 -j jobs
            Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simul­
            taneously.   If there is more than one -j option, the
            last one is effective.  If the  -j  option  is  given
            without  an  argument, make will not limit the number
            of jobs that can run simultaneously.
I would recommend using a number with "make -j" for a very large
job.  Then again, I could be wrong about the way that make behaves.
