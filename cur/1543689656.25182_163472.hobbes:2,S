I think Martin is right here. I don't know what would be a good reason
for wanting X to work nicely with a make -j25 running. X typically
needs at least 75% CPU on my box to be nicely interactive when moving
a window or scrolling something complex. This gives only 1% to each
cc1.
I am still working on my scheduler. I've removed backboost. It is
hypocritical of me to worry about complexity or difficult traceability
of say Con's implementation when backboost is probably "worse" than
anything he has ;)
So I've found I'm getting more consistent behaviour, but it is now
very dependant on nice to get X running well under load. I'm
concentrating on getting it working well with make -j <= 6.
