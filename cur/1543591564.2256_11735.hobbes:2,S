It is way too easy to crush your example, by pointing out that
Red Hat ships and automatically installs an Athlon-optimized kernel.
However, the argument above is wrong even if Red Hat did not.
We are talking about CML2 and interaction with Aunt Tullie.
This has nothing to do with automated rebuild at install time.
