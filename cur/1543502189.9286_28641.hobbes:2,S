That's right.  The problem is jitter which is visually noticeable -- the
fixed delay is something we seem to ignore easily.
BTW in the source I forgot to mention that the select() delay can come
out negative -- then you don't call select() of course.

Quite.  Jitter.
That's why I'm not too fussed about whether an extra tick is added or
not in general -- the busy wait is necessary in either case to get rid
of jitter.  I would like to see accurate schedule timing but that's a
different problem.

Or decouple timed scheduling from HZ altogether.

I was referring to software-only rendering.
It seems to be a perceptual thing -- the whole screen changes, and
there's so much going on that you just don't notice the perceptual
jitter.  Also there is jitter due to the limit on screen switching
times.
BTW 3d games get away with a much lower frame rate than 2d for that
"smooth" look too.  Though if you're a fussy viewer you do need high
rates for both.
