The current version (which your patch has crossed with) has these changed
to "required" and "prohibited" respectivly, to remove the ambiguity introduced by
tehe "no spaces X" form.
I did consider and reject the "is not required" form.  In english this
does not correct carry the "must not be present" meaning, it more means
"may or may not be present at your option".  Which is not what we are
trying to say either.
Hopefully the new wording is clearer to native and non-native english
speakers alike.
Thanks for doing the patch even so.
