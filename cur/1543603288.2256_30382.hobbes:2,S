Subject: [PATCH] nfsd 2.4.10: unbloat filehandles for export points

The otherwise excellent nfsd patches in 2.4.10 accidentally inflated
all filehandles for export points to the max size permitted by NFSv3:
64 bytes.  This problem isn't just cosmetic; it also breaks SFS
(
http://sfs.fs.net
).  Granted, SFS isn't living quite within the law,
but still there's no reason to inflate filehandles.
Thus, this (tested) patch:
