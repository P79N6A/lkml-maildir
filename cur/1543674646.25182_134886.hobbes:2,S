Ok guys. I have quite the same problem, and I tested justins aic on top of
2.4.21-rc2. You can expect it to perform better. Without justins aic my box
froze every day, with it I just managed to freeze it first time after 14 days.
It looks better, but not solved. I am now out and trying rc3 with justins
driver (20030520).
