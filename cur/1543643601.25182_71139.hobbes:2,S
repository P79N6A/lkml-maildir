Things to note:
"should" != "must"
1166 Internet numbers. S. Kirkpatrick, M.K. Stahl, M. Recker.
     Jul-01-1990. (Format: TXT=566778 bytes) (Obsoletes RFC1117, RFC1062,
     RFC1020) (Status: INFORMATIONAL)
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (not a standard)
RFC2119 defines should and must as:
1. MUST   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
   may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
   particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
   carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

If your users have access to ifconfig, then they can also send out
whatever packets they want via raw network sockets, even packets that
appear to be coming from external IP addresses.  Adding protection
into the kernel for 127/8 buys you nothing from a determined user
that has root.
I'd suggest configuring the firewall up correctly; deny traffic with
the 127/8 address being received via any non-loopback interface.
A good rule of thumb for firewalls:  Deny everything.  Then
explicitly specify what you want to let through.
