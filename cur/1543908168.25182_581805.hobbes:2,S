Okay, here is something to try.  Don't try this unless you haven't
already tested 2.6.23-rc2, since there is a bug that was fixed in
2.6.23-rc2 that might be the cause of your problem (you can test that
easily by specifying edd=skipmbr on the kernel command line.)
Anyway, if that doesn't solve it:
In main() in arch/i386/boot/main.c, please comment out everything from
query_mca() to query_edd(), inclusively.
