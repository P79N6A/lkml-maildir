We had a problem with this and Lustre, when we NFS export it.  Lustre is
already a network filesystem so we don't have a device number.  I had a
discussion with Neil Brown about this and suggested that we allow NFS to
get a _real_ stable export ID from the filesystem (e.g. superblock UUID
or similar) instead of the device number hackery which only has a vague
relationship to stable.
We implemented it for Lustre with a filesystem option FS_NFSEXP_FSID
that tells nfsd it can export such a filesystem in the absence of
FS_REQUIRES_DEV and then put our export ID into sb->s_dev (although I'd
prefer something slightly cleaner than that).
Cheers, Andreas
