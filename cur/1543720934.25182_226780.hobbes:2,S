That makes absolutely no sense (and should generate a warning anyway).
This is _NOT_ a userland pointer.  Obviously so - we are talking about
on-stack address, for crying out loud!

Again, makes no sense whatsoever (we _still_ get a warning and clear fix
would be to get rid of set_fs() here and switch to compat_alloc_user_space()).
Same goes for the rest of patch.
Folks, warnings are not personal performance metrics, they are tools for
finding bogus code.  Sigh...
