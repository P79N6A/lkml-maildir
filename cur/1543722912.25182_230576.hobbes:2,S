Hi Dan & Marc,
There was a memory leak in do_fork() which was fixed in 2.4.26-pre-something.
Maybe you can hit it with 200 kernel compiles ! I agree with Marc that you
should try with a non-rh kernel, and more specifically a *recent* kernel.
2.4.20 is quite old, even if there were additional security fixes added to
it. 2.4.27-rc2 is out and doing well, you might want to give it a try ?
Regards,
Willy
