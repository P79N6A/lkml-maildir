Well, it's renamed to zero_user_page and gained an argument.  We do
changed like that all the time and don't put silly deprecation warnings
in.

No, there is absolutely no point in feeding this through maintainers.
For something as trivial as a rename and adding an argument doing one
patch is enough and the right thing.  We can't feed any trivial global
search & replace through maintainer and generate warnings in the
meantime.
