Alternatively, limit the amount of memory supported to
32GB ;)
With only 1GB of lowmem you can't support much more
than that anyway.  The RHEL3 -smp kernel limits itself
to 32GB in order to have a smaller pte_addr_t.
For larger systems there's the -hugemem kernel, which
has Ingo's 4:4 split enabled.
