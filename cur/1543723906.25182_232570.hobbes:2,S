this must be some misunderstanding, i do not want to complain, and i
dont hope people get that impression, i am trying to do feedback, so
that issues can be fixed.
the thing about testing against a local apache, i did that, and its
fast, however, i still take that with a grain of salt, because, as said
before, even though that internet speed may vary from time to time, i
can see that kernel.org has plenty bandwith, and when 2.6.5 then
downloads with 200kb/s from 
http://kernel.org
, and 2.6.7 only 50kb/s,
this should be able to prove its some issues with 2.6.7, but thats just
my opinion
