I find this whole business of must check return value for sysfs files to
be gratuitous bloat. There are many cases (like this one) where we don't
really care and a printk will just increase the kernel size for no good
reason.
Maybe we can have a macro we can use to silence the warning when we
don't care about the result ? Can gcc do that ?
Ben.
