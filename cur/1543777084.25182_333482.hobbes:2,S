Everything does get built, just as you say... However, there is code 
inside cx88-dvb.c and saa7134-dvb.c that is enclosed within #ifdef's 
...  This code is NOT included during the compile.  For some reason the 
#ifdef's are turning up as false during compile time... In -mm1 this 
didn't happen.  For now, I am just setting these to true at the top of 
the *-dvb.c files... In the future, we (v4l) will either provide a 
better solution, or just remove the #define AND #ifdef's alltogether...  
I am including an excerp from cx88-dvb.c to illustrate what I am talking 
about:
#if CONFIG_DVB_MT352
# include "mt352.h"
# include "mt352_priv.h"
#endif
#if CONFIG_DVB_CX22702
# include "cx22702.h"
#endif
#if CONFIG_DVB_OR51132
# include "or51132.h"
#endif
#if CONFIG_DVB_LGDT3302
# include "lgdt3302.h"
#endif
<snip>
#if CONFIG_DVB_MT352
static int dvico_fusionhdtv_demod_init(struct dvb_frontend* fe)
{
	static u8 clock_config []  = { CLOCK_CTL,  0x38, 0x39 };
	static u8 reset []         = { RESET,      0x80 };
	static u8 adc_ctl_1_cfg [] = { ADC_CTL_1,  0x40 };
	static u8 agc_cfg []       = { AGC_TARGET, 0x24, 0x20 };
<snip>
static struct mt352_config dntv_live_dvbt_config = {
	.demod_address = 0x0f,
	.demod_init    = dntv_live_dvbt_demod_init,
	.pll_set       = mt352_pll_set,
};
#endif
<snip>
This should be enough to explain what I am talking about... Of course this is just a small snippet...
There is more in cx88-dvb.c that does this, as well as saa7134-dvb.c...
In -mm2, the code inside the #if is NOT compiled... This is a problem, and this is why I sumbitted the patch.
