It doesn't take that much - of that 20MB:
   the parent process occupies 2-3MB - ~2MB shared text + at most 1MB data.
   Each child will vary from 3MB (unused server) to maybe 10MB - 20 if
	the perl module is included. If CGI is used, then each child
	will have 2MB shared text + 2-3MB data + CGI.
   The CGI memory is reclaimed as they exit.
On the other hand, lets assume the amount IS accurate:
Without overcommit:
	You can support 100 simultaneous connections, with full saturation of
	each server, with no failures.
	Result: happy customers, happy management, maybe even a raise.
If you overcommit:
	You might support 100 simultaneous connections, but not full saturation
	of each server, without aborting some connections or crashing the
	server/system.
	Result: some unhappy customers, not so happy management, difficulty
		in identifying problems, and definitely no raise.
So you used 2G byte of swap - I know where you can by 18GB of swap for about
$300 US...
