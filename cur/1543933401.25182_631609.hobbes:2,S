Definitely.  So, two questions:
What's the preferred way to deal with the desire to view extended config 
space with "lspci -vvvxxx"?
Right now, we enable mmconfig for the bus/domain range requested by the 
BIOS [heh, so by implication many early BIOSen stomp themselves].
Is there a path for hw vendors, after passing 1,001 anal checks, to 
maintain the current behavior as it exists today in 
arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_{32,64}.c?
