Many file formats that require 'embedded' archives use cpio. RPM is one such 
file format. I think every single RPM distribution relying on cpio for the 
core of its package management system discounts your claim of 'nobody using 
it'. Just because you have not seen cpio directly used as an archive format 
doesn't mean it's unused.

tar and cpio are both POSIX standards. I fail to see how one is more 
'defacto' than the other. 
As far as having tar already being implemented by at least two people, it 
really doesn't matter for a format as simple as cpio. Having a reference 
implementation for tar would be nice, as it is a hairy, complicated standard. 
The cpio format can be fully described in less than a page.
