Of course this is one way around it (and there are certainly others).
But it (may) save "my" domains from false complaints and bounced emails
just because some spammer sends email "From: xxx@mydomain".
Yes, SPF does not avoid spam in general (and BTW nobody on openspf.org
claims that).
And yes, we all want such a thing, but AFAICS there won't be such a
thing (except making email - at least - as expensive as snail mail).
