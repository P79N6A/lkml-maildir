	Hello,
	The problem is that after making a halt (System halted shown) I push 
the power on/off button (that is set to power on/off in the BIOS) but it 
doesn't power off the system, instead the kernel intercepts it and reports  
something about APIC error, is this normal? if not I'll send detailed 
info.
