In light of the recent announcement by SGI (that the core of the XFS
journalling filesystem will be opensourced this summer) what is "the
panel's" view of the continuing devlopment of ext3/whatever the linux
jfs will be called. Should we adopt XFS as the defacto replacement for
ext2?
Of course this is all dependant on SGI coming through and releasing the
source under a kernel friendly licence agreement (GPL seems sensible to
prevent plundering by Sun/HP et al.) but whatever the outcome, the open
sourcing of commercial technologies (opposed to applications), whatever
they are is cool.
