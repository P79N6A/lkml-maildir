Yes. It need to be able to configure each LED individually as following.
this patch supports different two hardware.
LANDISK:
 LANDISK have two LED.
 power-led = blink.
 status-led = hard.
USL-5P:
 USK-5P have 7 LED and one BUZZER.
 power-led = blink.
 status-led = blink.
 led1 = none.
 led2 = none.
 led3 = none.
 led4 = none.
 led5 = none.
 buzzer = bitshift.

Thank you for explaining.
I understood the problem.
However, a complete solution is not hit on.
I think that it is the easiest solution to define the new trigger "Blink", and to use it.
