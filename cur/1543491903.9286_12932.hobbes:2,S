Folks,
I've just had two rather strange system lockups on my box - running kernel 
2.2.5. Whilst using 'dd' to copy a boot floppy image off a CD-ROM on to a 
floppy, the entire machine hung.
The system is running from an EIDE disk on /dev/hda, and the CD-ROM is on 
/dev/hdd. No 'unusual' system activity was happening at the times the crashes 
happened, and the crash is reproducable.
Anyone got any ideas? I don't even have an oops to go on...
Peter.
