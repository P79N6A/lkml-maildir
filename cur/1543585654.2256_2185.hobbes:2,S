Back in the early nineties I was working with 18 developers on a Data
General Aviion running DGUX. The system had only 16mb of memory and
600mb of disk. We were all continuously going thru the edit, compile,
debug steps developing as large Computer Aided Dispatch System. Never
did this system with its limited resources crash, or randomly start
killing user or system processes.
My $.02.
