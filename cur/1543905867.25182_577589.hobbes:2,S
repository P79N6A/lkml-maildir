I have not personally, however there has been a lot of testing of this
hardware feature both on other OS and for this particular implementation
by the powertop community, which is composed of community members running
all sorts of hardware.  So far I've not received any bug reports
wrt non-intel AHCI.  As I mentioned several times, the default for ALPM
is to be off anyway.

I think if it's applicable to SCSI at all it is fine.  If it is not, then
I think we need to make do with the interface we are given.  I do not think
we should hold up a feature for libata sysfs integration.

I want us to be careful about spreading a lot of unease without data to
back it up.

I believe so, but I'm obviously not privvy to their implementation details.
