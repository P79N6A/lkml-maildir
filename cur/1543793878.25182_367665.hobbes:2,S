Hi all,
It's impossible to enable the U32 classifier in QoS submenu, to use it
with the "tc" application. In fact there are 23 :-/ options and suboptions
that are missing from the configuration because it seems that the Kconfig
file is broken.
I don't know enough Kconfig syntax, but it seems that one of the problems
is here:
config NET_CLS_ROUTE
   bool
   default n
Anyway removing this doesn't show all the options, just some of them,
so there are more problems with the net/sched/Kconfig file.
