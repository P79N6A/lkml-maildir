I just realized something: The include files for functions dealing with
uids and gids (like getpwnam for instance) define them as 16 bit wide
versus 32 bits in i86 Solaris!!! Whose fault is this? e2fs? gcc? Will it
be upgraded? Can it be patched now?
I'm about to make a Solaris-to-L:inux migration and I'll have to perform
a few somersaults to fit the user database into 16 bits. Could be worse,
I know. But someone, somewhere, is going to hit this limit like a brick
wall. Think about big ISPs.
Cya,
