Well, we're trying.  It looks like another release of these patches
will be needed, so I'll have a shot at integrating those.
Judging by the number and severity of the bug reports which seem to be
flying past, 2.6.23 isn't exactly imminent.  And I've been basically
off the air this week due lack of electricity (building work).  And
next week won't be seeing a storm of activity..
