The patch disables sound for me. The programs play sound normally,
without any errors, there is just nothing out of the boxes.
Everything, I could think of, is unmuted.
Reverting the patch brings sound back.
I applied _not_ all of the -mm patches, so probably there is something
very important but not containing alsa anywhere in patch name.
It is an SMP (ht) machine.

alsa-101.patch
Alsa was applied last, and kernel was tested to work (with sound)
before applying alsa-101.
The only message in log: "kernel: intel8x0: clocking to 48000"
(in both kernels, working and not).
strace didn't any errors on the silent kernel.
