Nice idea! One more thought: Would it be possible (and useful) if the time
spent in spinning is changed dynamically?
I mean:
	1) If a lock needed schedule the previous time, decrease the time
           spinning for the next time the lock is contented
        2) If a lock didn't need to schedule, have a little more patience
	   and spin somewhat longer the next time
The heuristic can look a bit like the read-ahead in the vfs....
