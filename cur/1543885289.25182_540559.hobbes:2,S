Its basically not possible to do with most hardware because you get
deadlocks when there are shared interrupts.
However see drivers/uio in the current GIT tree (or recent -mm kernels),
that assumes you write a truely minimal IRQ handler/board driver in the
kernel and it then exposes the memory spaces and IRQ stream to user space.
