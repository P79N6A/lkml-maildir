CVS has a more comprehensive patch where the X server tells the DRI
module which pipe it should use to signal vblank. With the patch posted,
a dual-head environment will generate interrupts on *both* pipes, which
will reduce performance while negating the desired synchronized
behaviour.
The more complete fix requires updated DRI bits and an updated
xf86-video-intel 2D driver, but no changes are needed in the Mesa GL
driver. This bumps the i915 DRM version to 1.5.
When we start looking at mergedfb environments, we may want to consider
an even more sophisticated fix where the vblank used depends on the
dominant monitor displaying the window. The patch I made won't help with
that, unfortunately.
