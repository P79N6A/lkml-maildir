It's not unreasonable to have both installed, it's unreasonable to
require it.
Eric seems to think he can tell every distributor to ship Python2
tomorrow. Well it's a fine dream but it's not going to happen; Most
distributors do not ship new major versions of tools in their minor
number release versions. I've seen him mention the number 6 months
until everybody ships it, but a) thats not going to happen Red Hat is
currently at 7.1 (if one looks at their release history, one would say
there is a good chance there will be a 7.2) not to mention the release
rate of Debian (not sure about the current state of all other
distributions). 18 months is more realistic for it to be deployed
widely enough.

Well I don't like to quote personal conversations without peoples'
approval, now both David Woodhouse and Arjan are two examples.
