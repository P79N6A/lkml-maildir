Hi,
We have an application made up of 15 processes that interact through
shared memories and sockets. Each process computes for a few
milliseconds and then pass its data to the next one (a pipeline
computation scheme). When a process is done with its computation, it
calls pause() to release the CPU, it resumes its computation when its
timer interrupt wakes it every 10 milliseconds, if the computation
were not completed, we log this as an overrun.
With Kernel 2.0.36 on a Dell dual PII 400 MHz with 256 Mb RAM all
process are able to compute within there allocated 10 ms time frame.
With Kernel 2.2.1 on a Dell dual PII 450 MHz with 256 Mb RAM the
processes keep overrunning !  (same configuration, same amount of
computation). With Kernel 2.0.36 on the Dell dual PII 450 MHz, things
are normal (no overruns).
With Kernel 2.2.1, if I change the scheduling policy to FIFO with a
priority of 90 to 95, then things improve (there are less
overruns). But I observed something strange. If I use the Real Time
Clock (/dev/rtc) at 8192 Hz (or any high "enough" frequencies), things
improve even more, there are much less overruns for the very same
computation.
It looks as if the use of the RTC at high frequencies causes the
Kernel scheduler to be executed more often.
Also, with Kernel 2.2.1, I noticed with that a process has a tendency
to keep switching from one CPU to another (that process being the only
one using a noticeable amount of CPU according to ps and top). With
2.0.36, it almost never switch CPU ! That could explain why
performances seems more random with 2.2.1.
In the scheduler, is the PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY is large enough, is it
something else ?
Is there something to do to adress this ?
Comments ? Explanations ?
Claude
