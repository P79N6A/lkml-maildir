Well, for what it's worth, there are a few devices out there for which
there is no open source driver:
0000:02:02.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs [SB Live! Value]
EMU10k1X
(Dell Dimension 2100, *I think* - it's at work right, and I'm not)
I believe 4Front provides the only driver for that specific device (it's
a crippled EMU10k1, probably what could be called a "WinSoundchip")
