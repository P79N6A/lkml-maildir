A userspace program? I thought this was about kernel device drivers.

Some parallel port chips always return 0 on inb(base), for example
the AMD K6 boards that shipped with VIA Apollo chipsets (1998). On
the other hand, a chipset as old as to carry a i386DX CPU (probably
was all Intel back then) returns the desired 0xA on inb(base).
