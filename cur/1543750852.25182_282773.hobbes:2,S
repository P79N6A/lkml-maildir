Hi Andrew,
The following series of patches are mainly just cleanups of the ppc64 code
in order to eliminate the naca structure.  In the end, the naca only
exists for legacy iseries kernels.  One of the more intrusive parts of
these patches is the renaming of the fields of the lppaca structure to
eliminate another set of StudyCaps.
These patches (in total) have been built on iSeries, pSeries and pmac and
booted on iSeries and pSeries.
Please apply and send upstream.
