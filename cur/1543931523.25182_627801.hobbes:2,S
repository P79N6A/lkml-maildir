yeah. x86.git is "history-less" tree, as it frequently shrinks and grows 
we dont want to burden upstream's history with that pach management 
noise.
This means that it's a fresh new git tree every time i update it, not 
the usual append-only git history that is a descendant of the previous 
x86.git tree that you pulled.
You can force git to non-append jump-pull the remote via changing 
.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD from:
 ref: refs/remotes/origin/master
to:
 ref: +refs/remotes/origin/master
or you can use git-pull --force, but IMHO it's safer to edit the refspec 
because a mistaken --force can mess up some other tree by accident. Hope 
this helps,
