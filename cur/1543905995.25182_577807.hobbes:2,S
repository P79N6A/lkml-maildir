Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: delete CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_SLEEP (again)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_SLEEP is a NO-OP -- delete it (again).
Apparently 296699de6bdc717189a331ab6bbe90e05c94db06 creating CONFIG_SUSPEND
and CONFIG_PM_SLEEP was based on an out-dated version of drivers/acpi/Kconfig,
as it erroneously restored this recently deleted config option.
