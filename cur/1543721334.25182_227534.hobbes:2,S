One other thing that I'm not certain about in this patch is if there
is actually an important difference between "process" and
"session" key-rings.  I believe that the "session" distinction
should be left up to user-space software like PAM to determine
which key-ring "session" a process should belong to.  The user
and group key-rings are a good idea, so I guess the order with
which key-rings are checked for keys is:
	Thread
	Process
	Session???
	User
	Group
