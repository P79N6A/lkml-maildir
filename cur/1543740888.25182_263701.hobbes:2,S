yes, but all you care about is to turn off the incremental min, you
don't really care about lowmem_reserved, because you don't have floppies
that do ZONE_DMA allocations on ia64, x86-64 would oom-kill tasks just
because insmod floppy.o was running (and this is one of the showstopper
bugs in my queue, I had to disable forced the oom killer to workaroaund
it, apparently the vm can then later on free some page after many loops
despite without swap enabled).
