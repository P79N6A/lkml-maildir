No, pilot error ;-)
Linux supports three different backoff types which can be configured via
/proc or sysctl.  This is how to display the backoff type of interface
sp0, for example:
  [root@dl5rb] sysctl net.ax25.sp0.backoff_type
  net.ax25.sp0.backoff_type = 1
  [root@dl5rb]
1 in this example stands for linear backoff which is the default and what
you've been observing.  0 would be no backoff which generally in a shared
RF environment is probably unfriendly and can mathematically be shown to
cause network meltdowns.  Finally 2 would means exponential backoff,
which would use t1, 2*t1, 4*t1, 8*t1 for the waiting time, but never goes
worse than 8 * t1.
You can change the value with sysctl also but generally linear backoff is
quite reasonable.
