The changes that we are considering for 2.6.24 will result in a single 
zonelist per zone that will filter the zoneslist in alloc_pages. This lead 
to a performance improvement in the page allocator.
What you call a hack is doing the same for the special policy zonelist in 
2.6.23 in order to be able to apply policies to the two highest zones. We 
apply a limited portion of the changes for 2.6.24 to .23 to fix the 
ZONE_MOVABLE issue.
