Please reread my explanation above.  The bios has to compute the 
absolute offset based on the geometry and the values you pass it.  It 
does so by multiplying the track number you pass by the number of 
sectors per track, multiplies the cylinder number by the number of 
sectors per track and the number of tracks, and adds those two values to 
the sector number you pass to arrive at the LBA to read.  If it performs 
the CHS->LBA translation using a different geometry than you used to go 
from LBA->CHS, then it will get the wrong sector.
