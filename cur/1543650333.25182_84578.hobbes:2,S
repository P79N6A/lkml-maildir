Is the interface for this going to be ext2meta?  Al and sct seemed to 
agree that that was the best way act upon the filesystem metadata while 
it's online...  I'll probably be updating that for 2.5.x VFS changes in 
a few weeks, that will provide safe online defrag and a good interface 
for other metadata interaction.

It would be nice if this paper were available to everybody, and not
