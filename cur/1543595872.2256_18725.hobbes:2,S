yes, that works very well.  A userspace app sits on top of the
tun/tap device and pulls out packets, delays them and reinjects
them.
The problem is routing: when you send the packet back to the
kernel, it sends it straight back to you.  You need to rewrite
the headers, which is a pain.
A simpler approach is to use policy routing - use the source
and destination devices to override the IP addresses.  Works
well.  The code is at

It has its own variable bandwidth management as well
as variable latency.  It's for simulating narrowband, high
latency connections.
