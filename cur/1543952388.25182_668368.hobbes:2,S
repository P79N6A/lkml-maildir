Just a point of information, most of the mid-tier and above disk arrays 
can do replication/mirroring behind the scene (i.e., you write to one 
array and it takes care of replicating your write to one or more other 
arrays).  This behind the scene replication can be over various types of 
connections - IP or fibre channel probably are the two most common paths.
That will still leave you with the normal latency for a small write to 
an array which is (when you hit cache) order of 1-2 ms...
