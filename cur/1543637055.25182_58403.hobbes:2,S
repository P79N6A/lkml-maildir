Yes, the cache is allowed to take all memory in the system, but
when something needs to run the memory will be reclaimed.
Of course it's also possible that program memory will be swapped
out instead of reclaiming from the cache, but the way rmap is
balanced means that the system is more likely to swap out cache
memory .. unless the memory from the cache is heavily accessed.

Kswapd removes the right pages from RAM, that is: pages that will
not be used again soon (most likely).  This also means it doesn't
need to read those pages in again from disk and the VM is less
busy as a result.
It also changes some data structures inside the kernel to remove
some of the complexity in chosing which page to evict from RAM,
meaning that it can choose the right page to evict with less CPU
usage.
kind regards,
Rik
