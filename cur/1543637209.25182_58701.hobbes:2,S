I was asking Dave McCracken and he mentioned that rmap and highmem pte
don't play nice together.  I tried turning that off and it boots without
error now.  Someone might want to take a look at getting those two to
work cleanly together especially now that rmap is in.  But for now, this
will work around the problem.
Thanks,
