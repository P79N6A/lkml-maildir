Thanks.  It seems the problem is Evo (or possibly firefox) has a slow
memory leak.  I overlooked the fact that Evo had been running for more
than a week.
I guess the only possible kernel issue is that Evo never gets
OOM-killed, always Firefox (or OpenOffice if it's running), although
it's the biggest hog.  I'll have to investigate more.
