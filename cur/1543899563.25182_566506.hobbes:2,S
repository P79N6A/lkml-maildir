I'm at a bit of a loss on this one I'm afraid - it seems to be specific
to a couple of boards and every IT821x box I can lay my paws on works
beautifully.
It would be useful to know if a kernel built with no DMA support for the
IT8212 behaved as that might give us a clue about what is choking. If you
look in drivers/ata/pata_it821x.c:it821x_init_one you'll see a pair of
lines that say
	mwdma = 0x1f,
	udma_mask = 0x7f
remove, rebuild and report..
Thanks
Alan
