	If you were using the included driver you need to update it.  Pick
up the updated patches from Sangoma.  We have a 2.2.7 + new Sangoma patch
in staging running 8 100Mbit ether (K6-3 450, 192M ECC, boots off flash to
ramdrive, 2 ANA6944TX quad cards, 1 Sangoma S508/FT1, and a Wavelan 915mhz
wireless ether), working ok so far but have not abused the Frame link yet.
