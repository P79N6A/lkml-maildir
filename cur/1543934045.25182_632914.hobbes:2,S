As an example, the whole purpose wireless-compat package is
to load latest bleeding edge wireless stuff into a distribution kernel.
So people are not required to recompile their kernels for using
drivers that support their hardware.
And guess what, it is used a _lot_. And lots of bugs are found with it.
It increases our testing community a lot.
So, all this wouldn't work, if kernel symbols could randomly get
nuked by some "garbage collector".
In practice, no distribution would use symbol garbage collection, as the
only benefit from it would be an increased level of bugreports.
