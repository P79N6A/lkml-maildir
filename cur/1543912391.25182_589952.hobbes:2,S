Thanks for working that out: your patch certainly works for me,
and would be good to see in 2.6.23, to prevent lots of users getting
an unnecessary CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU forever after.  I wonder what config
options this might have forced in the past.

But please add a sentence to your patch description, something like:
make oldconfig from a 2.6.22 .config with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU not set
was in some configurations setting CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y without asking,
even when there was no actual requirement for CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
Thanks,
Hugh
