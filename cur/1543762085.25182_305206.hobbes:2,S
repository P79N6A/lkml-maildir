You can turn off a network interface and turn it back on without
closing a network application and it will continue to work.

I see this issue less a case of bad guys vs. good guys. I see it
as various components doing system related work, but there is
no mechanism of knowing who is on who is off by today's patch. A
service listening to the fork connector can request to turn off
cn_fork_enable on exit and inadquately affect other services/daemons
listening to the same connector. It is not acceptable in my opinion.
The idea of implementing fork connector enabling/disabling was so
that the kernel does not waste time writing to the sockets if no
application listening. If implementing such a feature costs
more than it saves, maybe the fork connector should simply always
send?
