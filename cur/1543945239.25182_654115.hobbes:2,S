This is for 2.6.25 and 2.6.24.y, but NOT for 2.6.23.y.
Thanks,

I added a nasty local variable shadowing bug to fuse in 2.6.24, with
the result, that the 'default_permissions' mount option is basically
ignored.
How did this happen?
 - old err declaration in inner scope
 - new err getting declared in outer scope
 - 'return err' from inner scope getting removed
 - old declaration not being noticed
-Wshadow would have saved us, but it doesn't seem practical for
the kernel :(
More testing would have also saved us :((
