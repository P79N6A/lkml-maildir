You will need to implement this in your replacement init because 
one of init's jobs is to wait on unparented zombie tasks.  In the 
sysvinit package, see chld_handler() in init.c which handles the 
SIGCHLD signal.
Basically, I believe all you need to do is waitpid() in the SIGCHLD
handler until you get a 0 return code.
