All the current netlink messages are structs with basic data with a
variable list of attributes. This is easy to parse and all current
netlink tools support uniformly. Is it intentional that you are now
switching to text data that needs to be parsed? Your patch seems
to have RFC822-style headers that would work perfectly as standard
netlink attributes to a message.
