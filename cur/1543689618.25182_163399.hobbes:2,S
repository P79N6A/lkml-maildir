Men! Why is everyone doubting the usefulness of assembler optimized parts?
It's twice as fast on my Athlon. I assert the same is true for P3/P4. Just
test.
twofish-i586.ko's .text section is smaller than the kernel's twofish.ko's. 945
bytes to be precise. Please note that twofish-i586 includes TWO
implementations: C and assembler. Just think about how much smaller it will
be when I rip out the C part. 
So much for that.

How can you be sure? Mathematical program verification applies quite badly to
assembler.

I'm sorry, your critique is too generel to be useful.
