Paraphrase: Replace filtering code that catches spam with filtering
code based on checking header content that can be trivially forged by
spammers.

Current figures are irrelevant, spammers react to spam filters and they
react very quickly[*].  If you replace "reject HTML bodies" with "allow
HTML based on known From: lines" then the spammers will send HTML
bodies with forged headers, because they know it will get through.
That will require the original HTML filters to be reintroduced, the end
result is you added an extra step for new posters without reducing the
spam or users whining "my mail does not get through".
[*] About 24 hours after slashdot carried a story on Baysian spam
    filters, I started receiving HTML spam that contained comments that
    were designed to fool the Baysian filters, like this.
    FREE 1 MONTH SUPP<!--kernel-->Y WITH THIS
    The comment has no effect on the spam display but the use of
    non-spam words skews the Baysian rules on whether the content is
    spam or not.
