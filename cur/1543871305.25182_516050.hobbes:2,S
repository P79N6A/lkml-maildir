Embedded people, I guess.  The problem here is that if we are gonna
support !CONFIG_PM configuration and try to reduce the kernel/module
images size for such case, we end up sprinkling #ifdef's all over huge
number of device drivers.
If we determine to drop !CONFIG_PM configuration, I'm happy with that
too but we need to determine something here.  Alternatives...
1. drop !CONFIG_PM configuration
2. continue to sprinkle #ifdef's over device drivers
3. find out prettier way to mark PM functions
