FFFFFFFF!!!!
This returns ffffffff too:
  cb_writel(socket, CB_SOCKET_MASK, 0x0);
  if ((temp = cb_readl(socket, CB_SOCKET_MASK)) != 0)
    printk("Yenta: probe can't write socket mask %x\n",temp);
because the device is somewhat "passive" after a suspend....
Should we save all registers? - it has 128
It sits on the same bus with ide, e100 which work, so it won't
be pci related - OK?.
Another thing, even lspci returns crap after suspend because 
data come from RAM rather than device(s).
I would like to do generic pci_save_state/pci_restore_state 
centraly in the pci driver. It would reduce other driver side 
work too.
What is the possible downside of this approach and your 
opinion in general?
Regards
Michael
