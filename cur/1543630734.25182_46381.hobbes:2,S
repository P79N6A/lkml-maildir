Subject: [PATCH] fixing supermount for > 2.4.19pre4

Hi,
in 2.4.19pre4, the dentry revalidation has been patched, and the VFS behavior 
has changed due to an NFS bugfix. All non-standard remote file systems (like 
supermount, ftpfs, etc.) are in conflict with the patch and may not operate 
correctly.
Alan Cox pointed out that non-standard remote file systems should get fixed 
for 2.4.19. So, here is my quick hack for supermount 0.7 that changes the 
return policy in the d_revalidate operation. Supermount should work now in 
2.4.19pre4 kernels and higher.
Other file systems with similar revalidate policy can get fixed accordingly.
Cheers,
Jörg
