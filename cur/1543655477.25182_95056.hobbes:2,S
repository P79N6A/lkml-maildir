Subject: Radeon DRI w/ large memory

I recently upgraded my memory to 1GB and compiled 4GB large memory support
into the kernel.  Now, my display freezes when I try to use DRI with my
ATI Radeon VE (Radeon 7000 chipset IIRC).  The machine is still responsive
to the LAN, but even if I kill X, the display remains frozen.  Disabling
large memory support makes the problem go away.
I can live without the extra 44MB of memory, but I'd really like to get this
fixed.  I vaguely remember hearing about a bug like this, but I have to
idea how to patch it.  I use 2.4.20-ac1 and my motherboard is a Gigabyte
GA-7VRX.
Thanks,
Daniel Franke
