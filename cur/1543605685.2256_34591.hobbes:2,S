I certainly can't argue with your logic.  :-)
Actually, I believe there are some decent, honest, well-meaning people in our
government.  It's just that they seldom have much influence on policy.  :-(

Oh, come on.  Every government is right on some issues.  Proof:
     For every government X there is at least one government Y such that X
would claim that Y is a bunch of corrupt assholes.  Since every government
_is_ a bunch of corrupt assholes, every government is right at least in one
of its claims.
