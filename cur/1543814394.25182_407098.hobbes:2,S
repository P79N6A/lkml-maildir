Great!  That has really been long overdue.

Given that the kernel now requires gcc 3.2 or later, that already includes 
a native boolean type (_Bool)?  Why not use that instead of "int"?
Also <stdbool.h> contains:
#define bool	_Bool
#define true	1
#define false	0
So we could take the bool rather than _Bool, too given _Bool looks 
rather ugly...
We could even go as far as removing all those typedefs and replacing all 
their uses with the native boolean type (or the "bool" define or 
whatever).  Seems like the perfect janitorial task to me.  (-;
Best regards,
