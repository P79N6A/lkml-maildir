freeze or random oopses when the X-server terminates. It is happening on both 
machines I am using whose hardware configuration differs slightly, however 
both of them are equipped with ATI video cards (ATI Rage 128 and ATI Radeon 
8500), and both of them run the same version of X-server. That's about all 
they have in common.

seen it to (~60% of the time)
my X is quite old:
XFree86 Version 4.2.0 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6600)
Release Date: 18 January 2002
thought that it was a problem of X and didn't have time to update it 
(although I played with a lot of -mm kernels since 2.5.64).
