I don't think so.  We're getting the wrong answer out of
calculate_zone_totalpages() which is an init-time thing.
Maybe nr_free_zone_pages() is supposed to fix that up post-facto somehow,
but calculate_zone_totalpages() sure as heck shouldn't be putting 1568768
into my ZONE_NORMAL's ->node_present_pages.
