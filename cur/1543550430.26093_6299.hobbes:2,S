It would must be so easy to inhibit the write head on losing the
power-good signal, or perhaps trying to hang in there until the end of
the current write. ??There is a power-good signal on a PC isn't there?? 
So, which drives don't do this (so I can be sure not to buy one) and
which do?
Tux2 deals with the possibility of a bad write in the last block by
checkpointing each new metaroot and writing it to a location different
from the last one (waaaay far away).  This assumes that only the last
block written has a chance of getting random scribbles in it.  If it's
possible to get random scribbles in places other than the last block,
the only reasonable solution I can think of is throwing away the drive.
I'd be happy if someone would point me at some low-level engineering
info along these lines so I can really get down and dirty in my
analysis.  I tend to take a programmer's view of these things and assume
that the logical way is the way they've actually been designed, but
that's just isn't always the case.

With Tux2 all you need is an iret there.
