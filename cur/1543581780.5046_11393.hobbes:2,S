It's currently not designed for multihead usage.
I haven't looked at it much, but I believe that the
linux-console project is working on that.  (?)

I agree; your suggestion (same physical device on same connector =>
same logical device) makes sense to me, at least for some
devices, like mice and keyboards.  For some devices it could
lead to misuse of the device.

Use /dev/input/mice for this case, not /dev/input/mouse0 .
(Ah, I said /dev/usb/mice earlier; should be /dev/input/mice .)

Yes, we can/do know what physical connector a device is attached
on.
