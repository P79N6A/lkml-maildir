This is not an elevator starvation problem.
I also experienced these stalls with my IDE-only system.  Unless I'm
badly mistaken, the elevator is only used on SCSI disks, therefore
elevator starvation cannot be blamed for this problem.  These stalls
are particularly annoying since I want to find the pid of the process
hogging memory in order to kill it, but the read from /proc stalls for
45 seconds or more.
