No. But it must have rules about what to do with all possible device
types (at least very generic default rules), based on the data the
drivers can provide to identify the device.

If the using an UUID stored on the device (like the filesystem UUID), yes.

Not necessarily. But udev must get the all the data that could possibly
be used for assigning a name to the device. It can get them either as
hotplug command line arguments and environment variables or via sysfs,
or by any other means.
