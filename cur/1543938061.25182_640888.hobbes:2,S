So my understanding is that you want to get a "IPC shared memory for
dummies" API. You're already willing to use custom-numbered system
calls, requiring to recompile the Linux kernel, having to add these
system calls to libc (or putting _syscallX macros into the
application's code) and loosing all portability for the application
using this API.
My point of view is that this is a planed nightmare :)
I'd suggest to dig into "Unix Network Programming, Volume 2.
Interprocess Communications" and implement that API as a library
instead of using a set of new kernel system calls. That way, the
applications using it will use that API and only that. They won't
require operatins system specific modifications afterwards. OTOH, this
library will probably quite portable by itself and shouldn't need
any kernel changes, independent of the underlying kernel.
