I see.  I think there is a more straightforward solution: PAT does the
same thing as MTRRs, but has no such "number of ranges" limitation ---
it lets you set the memory type on a page-by-page basis.  If the
number of MTRRs becomes a problem (anyone know how many the P4 has?),
then the real solution is to implement PAT support.
IIRC, only the PPro, the first PII model (Klamath?), and the first
Celeron model have MTRR but not PAT (Athlon has PAT, but /proc/cpuinfo
misreports it as "fcmov", at least in 2.2.14; Xeons always had PAT).
