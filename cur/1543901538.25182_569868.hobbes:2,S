Why did you cut off the rest of the sentence?
To illustrate the problem a little different: a task with a nice level -20 
got around 700% more cpu time (or 8 times more), now it gets 8500% more 
cpu time (or 86.7 times more).
You don't think that change to the nice levels is a little drastic?
bye, Roman
