Sorry, I think one macro to get the address, one to get the contents
is a *horrible* interface.  per_cpu() and per_cpu_ptr() or something?
I think you'll find that per_cpu_ptr would be fairly common, so we're
forced into a bad interface for little gain.  You might be better off
using another method to implement per-cpu areas.
To be honest, it was merely my oversight that the statement expression
didn't allow the address to be taken in the first place, not a
feature.
Sorry,
Rusty.
