> This patch is by far the most complex in the series.  It adds a new syscall
> paccept.  This syscall differs from accept in that it adds (at the userlevel)
> two additional parameters:
> 
> - a signal mask
> - a flags value
> 
> The flags parameter can be used to set flag like SOCK_CLOEXEC.  This is
> imlpemented here as well.  Some people argued that this is a property
> which should be inherited from the file desriptor for the server but
> this is against POSIX.  Additionally, we really want the signal mask
> parameter as well (similar to pselect, ppoll, etc).  So an interface
> change in inevitable.

> The flag value is the same as for socket and socketpair.  I think
> diverging here will only create confusion.  Similar to the filesystem
> interfaces where the use of the O_* constants differs, it is acceptable
