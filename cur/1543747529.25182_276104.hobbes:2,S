Not that I've seen. Maybe your school. Google also doesn't seem to agree 
with you. In other words, it seems to be in pretty limited use.

Oh, I know what an ABI is. I just don't think your "contract" part has 
anything to do with it.

I think you're making that up. Maybe there's some sw cult that swears by 
"contract programming", the same way there are the "extreme programming" 
cults etc.  For example, I find this "Design by Contract" cult for object- 
oriented programming, but it has _zero_ to do with external API's, and is 
all about the interfaces for object-oriented components.
IOW, I don't find your arguments or your language usage in the least 
convincing. But hey, I did all my CS stuff outside of the US, whatever.
