Hi all,
every now en then, I have the keyboard repeat rate and delay which seem
to
reset to the default BIOS speed of about 6 chars a second and 1 sec
delay.
When this happens, it emediatly affects all consoles and X terminals at
the
same time, and there doesn't seem to be a way to reset this back to
higher
speeds (actually as fast as possible) except by rebooting.
This phenomenon is rare (about once every 2 months), but only seem to
happen
since kernel 2.2 (or just before), and I can't reproduce it at will.
What I see is a brief light up of the keyboard leds like during boot.
It doesn't happen during extreem system load nor am I a fast typer.
for what it's worth:
 the keyboard is connected via the PS/2 connector.
 the chipset is mvp3 (if that changes anything)
I can send more info, but I don't know what's relevant.
has anybody else seen this ? could this be a defect of my keyboard ?
This last bit bothers me, as my keyboard _is_ about as old as this.
However, I have the fealing the no keyboard defect could reset this
value without showing some other problem as wel. or could it ?
Cheers,
Ernest.
