What you said...  In my case, I don't use the soundblaster side of
the card (last four pas2 parameters 0,-1,-1,-1), but building the pas16
and opl3 into the kernel still results in the opl3 not working because
the opl3 gets initialized before the pas16.

Back on March 10 I mentioned to Alan that there was no way to control
the order in which built-in sound devices were initialized, and this
meant we were pretty much forced to go with modules.  He indicated he
wasn't working on 2.3.X stuff and hadn't been for a while, so for what
it's worth, *I* agree with your analysis.  I'm not sure what the
officially blessed method of manipulating built-in device initialization
order is, but my initial knee-jerk thought is to bypass opl3
initialization if CONFIG_SOUND_PAS is defined (compile-time directive),
and have the PAS16 init code call the opl3 init code if
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812 is defined.  Yeah, it's ugly, but we shouldn't be
forced to build device drivers for non-removable devices as modules,
and auto-probing for sound devices is a minefield I don't think we're
ready to walk through :-).
