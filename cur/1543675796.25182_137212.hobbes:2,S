Well, the CPU I bought was supposed to support hyper-threading. That's
what it even says on the box (new Hyper-thread technology)! I guess
Hyper-thread technology isn't "hyper-thread", only its "technology",
like it's got some pins and takes power.

These were purchased together to be a "hyper-thread" board
for my new system. I have always had two CPUs since SMP became
available, and I wanted to experiment with the new "single-CPU"
SMP architecture.

I got ripped off. I got sold a board that doesn't have the gigibit
adapter populated plus, you can't tell from a distance because the
connector is present, but has some metal tape covering the hole.
This board costs $275 plus the CPU was $635. I got badly raped
and the vendor won't take them back.
