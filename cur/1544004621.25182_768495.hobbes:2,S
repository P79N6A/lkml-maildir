Hello, Greg.
I'm now trying to convert the cdev thing for CUSE and it just ain't
feel right.

That "normally" is from the days when only a single or fixed number of
devices are associated with single module or driver.

Yes, it requires all drivers to have global device table and check
whether the device is still available at ->open.  For most, drivers
usually have certain fixed number of devices which can directly be
indexed with minor.  For CUSE, it gotta be a hash table or a b-tree.
I don't really see any point in not adding ->release.  Time has
changed and everybody is playing with reference counts and ->release
methods.  Plus, cdev_alloc() interface is half-baked anyway (no free
function for cases where cdev_add() fails, drivers call cdev_del() in
those cases risking unregistering other driver's map).  It's perfectly
okay to keep it around for compatibility but there just is no reason
to cling to it.

Heh... CUSE did that too.  Removing it.
Thanks.
