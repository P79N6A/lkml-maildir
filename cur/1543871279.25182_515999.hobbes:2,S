This is actually pretty standard handling for a lot of drivers: any
device which can appear on a cardbus or other hot-unpluggable bus and which
shares interupts needs such treatment.
I don't know whether anything which this driver drives could ever appear on
such a bus, but I'm inclined to just apply it into 2.6.21.
(I'm also inclined to drop the darned mmc tree - am getting rather tired of
people moving their files all over the tree all the time).
