Yes, I can generate it at will on two quite different IDE machines
with the run-bash-shared-mapping script from
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/ext3-tools.tar.gz
It's on my list of things-to-do, filed under "hard".  It even happens
on uniprocessor, with unmask_irq=0.
Interestingly, I _think_ it only ever occurs against the
swap device.  But I need to confirm this.  Marc, do you
have swap on /dev/hda1?
