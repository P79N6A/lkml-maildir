Hard to say, but consider this:
Something patented is _not_ a secret, and therefore not a trade secret.
Anything patented can be looked up in the patent databases by anybody.
So there cannot be any problem with distributing this patented knowledge.
Using it is another matter, but it is up to the user not to disable
CONFIG_USA within us jurisdiction.
