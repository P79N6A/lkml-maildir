Maybe others have had better luck with the IDE Zip as IDE
Floppy configuration; I've had no luck at all with it -
including several kernel hangs in the ext2fs code (but
not related to ext2fs - related to the IDE Floppy API
and it's mismatch with the Zip drive functionality). I've
also seen several FAQs stating that using ide-scsi is the
best way to get an IDE Zip working reliably.
Meanwhile, it does work fine with the IDE code running
my hard drive(s) and CD-ROM, and the ide-scsi running the
Zip. The only nuisance is the need to manually do an
'insmod scsi_mod; insmod ide-scsi' in the startup files.
I had to exclude the IDE Floppy code from the kernel/modules.
