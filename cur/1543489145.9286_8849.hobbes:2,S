I just bought a new dual PII motherboard (Gigabyte 6BXDS)
and replaced my old PII motherboard (Gigabyte 6BXC).  I
was using 2.2.1, so I did a make config, turned on SMP,
and then did a make clean ; make dep ; make bzImage.  I
copied this image over to /boot, added an entry in lilo.conf
and ran lilo, then rebooted.  The new kernel was able to
detect and use both CPUs, but in X I have to sometimes click
several times on a window to raise it.  I downloaded and built
2.2.2 and have the same problem.
I had 2.0.36 still in my source directory, so I build an
SMP kernel of that and tried it.  X had no problems.  I
thought the window manager I was using (WindowMaker) may
be the problem, so I switched to fvwm.  No change.  Any
ideas?  This is my first time trying to use Linux SMP.
