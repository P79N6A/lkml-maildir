Well, I claim not to have ignored it.
I have gone thru the entire patch-2.4.1 file and can't see
anything there that would cause what you are seeing.
You aren't using ACPI, right?  (not in your log files)
[That just makes the patch file of interest smaller.]

Have you booted 2.4.0 again (lately)?  You log file is from
Jan-08-2001.  It may also report only 64 MB now, based on
some kind of BIOS change (or ESCD ...) since Jan-08.
Someone else with a similar "problem" actually had a fruit fly
in one of their slots that caused a problem, so I would ask that
you (a) boot 2.4.0 again to see if it works now and (b) remove
adapters, clean slots, reseat adapters, boot 2.4.1 again.
