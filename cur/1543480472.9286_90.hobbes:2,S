Linus releases all official kernels, not the 'Linux software team', so
it should read something like:
'Santa Clara, Calif. - January x, 1999 - Linus Torvalds today announced
the immediate availability of Linux 2.2.0., the much touted successor to
Linux 2.0.0.' 
> * Y2K compliance.
Previous 2.0.x kernels were Y2K compliant.
