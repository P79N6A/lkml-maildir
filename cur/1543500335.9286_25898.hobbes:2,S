I was aware of that, this is why I underlined _does not_.
But it would be overdosed to call panic() on kassert(),
so kassert() is identical to assert() except that is does return.
I don't think that kassert() and kassertoops() are required:
kassert() should print all information that an oops would print, but
then it tries to continue. The worst thing that could happen is an
oops, so we win nothing by oopsing immediately.
