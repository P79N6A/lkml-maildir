Not everyone is as deficient as I am.  But I do agree with you.
I think Martin had good reason to do his "maxpages = swp_offset(....)"
to work out the maximum pgoff expressible in an architecture's swap
offset bits; but just went overboard in doing likewise with swap type.
MAX_SWAPFILES and MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT are defined in the common
include/linux/swap.h, and every architecture supports that many
(some could manage more, but swp_type doesn't let them).  If an
architecture came along which somehow couldn't support that many
(seems unlikely to me), then we'd move MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT into
into arch-dependent files, wouldn't we?
Yes, I'm all for sys_swapon just saying "if (type >= MAX_SWAPFILES)".
