Hi!
I'm in trouble with some 2.2.x-kernels (2.2.6, too):
The kernel had nearly nothing compiled in (even no networking), I've
compiled with
	gcc 2.7.2.3
and switched the computer on "fresh" (this is not necessary). Sometimes
everything is okay. But
too often it hangs with:
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 12, function 
ncr53c8xx: 53c875 detected with Tekram NVRAM
ncr53c875-0: rev rev=0x03, base=0xdf800000, io_port=0xb000, irq=11
ncr53c875-0: Tekram format NVRAM, ID 7, Fast-20, Parity Checking
ncr53c875-0: on-chip RAM at 0xdf000000
CACHE TEST FAILED: script execution failed.
start=00007230, pc=00007238, end=0000725c
CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED.
ncr53c875-0: detaching...
And then the kernel fails mounting root.
But if the kernel is doing "normal" its easily possible to crash the
system (it just stops, the host-adapter-led is on and an led of one or
more disks, too):
while : ; do ls -laR / ; done		("/" is /dev/sda)
	on another terminal:
cat /dev/sdc > /dev/null
It takes about 20 seconds. I dont need the "cat" when I start
"/sbin/update" before.
An other way is:
cat /dev/sda > /dev/null &
cat /dev/sdc > /dev/null &
cat /dev/sdd > /dev/null &
But now I have to switch from one vt to another and back and forth and
back... I really hold down Ctrl and Alt pressing: F1, F6, F10, F1, F6...
I twiddle then about 10 sec.
Maybe I dont need to change the virtual terminals, but after 10 min.
"catting" I get bored and played again with Ctrl+Alt+Fx,Fy,Fz... - This
took again only some seconds...
Kernel 2.2.2 is less problematic during reboot (first problem), but here I
tried only with kernel+raid-patches. - I'm now using this kernel (I depend
on raid): uname -a
Linux panorama 2.2.2 #6 Fri Mar 5 01:47:41 CET 1999 i586 unknown
I had no problems (during reboot) with kernel 2.0.3x. And the second
problem didn't appear. I updated all things mentioned in
"Documentation/Changes" for 2.2.x
Ah! I forgot to mention, that the SYM53C8XX-Driver was a little bit
different: already one "ls -laR /" stopped the system...
Who can help me? What should I further report? And most important:
Which searchengine is _really_ capable looking for:
	ncr53c875 and "CACHE TEST FAILED"
in the linux-mailing-lists? - I failed here, too.
Thanks for everything!
Bye,
	Rob
