Question: would it be advisable to add an atomic killuser system call to
kill all processes belonging to a certain user (and optionally blocking
any attempts to create processes owned by them), including, of course,
login shells?  This would seem to be an excellent way to smash a really
bad user before they can do any harm, and also preventing them from
leaving any backdoors in place (cron scripts, cgi scripts, etc.).
