What I would to see also included here is to provide a clean posix
interface to these drivers. IMHO the current char interfaces to clock
drivers should be removed. Look at SGI's mmtimer implementation in
2.6.10-rc3. We have modified the posix interface to allow clock drivers to
export their timer values via CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE and we are also
now able to schedule hardware interrupts via timer_* posix functions
utilizing CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE that are then delivered as signals to an
application. Timer chips usually include time sources as well as the
ability to generate periodic or single shot
interrupts. There needs to be some way for clock drivers to cleanly
interface with these. The API may be the posix subsystem but I do not
like the quality of the code nor the current API for the clock drivers.
The API for user space to clocks already exists through the posix
standard. I would suggest to work with that standard for a way to deal
with clocks under Linux.

These are not really functions right? timesource_read can be a direct
memory read and the cyc2ns and ntp_scale can be reduced to some scaling
factor?

Please do not call this function from monotonic_clock but provide some
sort of scaling factor that is adjusted from time to time.

I think 64 bit values are fine but then I work for a 64 bit company and
this may just be the contextual predisposition.

In that case maybe the "ticks" are the timesource and not really tick
processing per se.
There could be a separation between "increment counter" and tick processing.
