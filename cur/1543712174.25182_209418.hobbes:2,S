i sent an email last night, but i think my email host was down so i will 
try again. since 2.6.x can preempt, what do you think about using a call 
gate in place of int 80? sysenter was implemented in this fashion for 
p4's, but there are a lot of pre p4 boxes still out there. operations 
that will not allow for a conforming code segment could simply turn 
around and issue the int 80, or use a task gate.
