That is what I am trying to do, making bool as accepted as any other 
integer. No more, no less.

Yes it is, but I am (for now) trying to convert those who uses some sort 
of boolean to the generic one (in fs/ for now). Right now the ntfs/- and 
partitions/-conversion seem to have thumbs up, in -mm.

A root-beer maybe?
What do you say, can you hold on it for a while (can't be urgent, can 
it?) and see how the conversion go. Will take time for it during this 
week(end) and if the result is that almost no maintainer wants it, then...
Just seem strange to having a boolean function but declaring it integer, 
for (in my knowledge) no reason.
