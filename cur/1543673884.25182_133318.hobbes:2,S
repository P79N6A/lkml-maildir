That sounds like a believable explanation.  My copy of the generic UHCI
specification does not include the OC port status bits.  I'm guessing from
your mail they are either bit 10 or bit 11 of the PORTSC registers, can't
tell which.  Maybe they are an Intel-specific addition?  Or perhaps a more 
recent version of the spec has more information -- the one I've got is 1.1 
(March 1996).
Can you suggest a good way of detecting whether or not a controller is
part of a PIIX4 chipset, to indicate whether or not the OC bits are valid?  
Maybe the PCI vendor and product codes will have that information?  I'm
not sure it's safe to assume that any old host controller will have
meaningful values there; the spec just says "reserved" and doesn't
stipulate that they will always read as 0's.
