Then suse's  use of reiserfs is pretty b0rken. Putting reiserfsck on /
partition is pretty useless -- if it crashes during mount you can't
repair it.
If reiserfsck detects errors on /, you can't repair them because
reiserfsck is on that partition. Ouch.

I already repaired my system -- had to install another copy of suse to
another partition :-(.

No stack trace, sorry. It refused to mount saying that attempting to
write into log block.. That's panic. Reiserfsck is not usable in such
case, because ... how do you run reiserfsck from partition you can't
mount?
