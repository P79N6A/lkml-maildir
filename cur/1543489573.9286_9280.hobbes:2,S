As a general rule in the capability based system the superuser should
not have special [read] access to sensitive things simply because of its
[e]uid being 0. The /proc/ filesystem makes this hard to enforce because
files like /proc/kcore are readable by uid=0.
Here is a patch to make it possible for the admin to mount /proc/ (plus
all of its sub directories and special files) with uid.gid other than
0.0. It simply propagates the already supported uid= and gid= mount
options for the top level /proc directory to the non-process-specific
files within the proc filesystem.
Cheers
