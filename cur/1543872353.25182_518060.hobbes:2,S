My first nsproxy control fs was not based on Paul's set, but was very
nsproxy-specific.  After that I based it on Paul's set.  The nsproxy
subsystem is in Paul's latest patchset.
On top of that set I've posted a set to implement namespace entering,
but that is on hold (or dropped) because the only people so far
interested in namespace entering don't like an fs interface.
If you wanted to take my original non-container fs nsproxy interface and
try to rebuild resource containers on top of them I don't think you'll
get anything better than containers, but then maybe you would...
