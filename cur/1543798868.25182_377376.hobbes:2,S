Maybe, but I would not bet anything on that statement.  I'm sure there 
are people still using semaphores for IO completion, calling up() from 
interrupt handlers.  And the fact is that it still works fine.

This is IMHO too fragile and too easy to screw up.  And it puts extra 
conditions on the usage of semaphores that don't exist today.
This is why I think spliting counting semaphores and mutexes _is_ a good 
thing.  There is no special "no from interrupt" issue to care about with 
the unlock operation, it has better performances where the count is not 
important (the vast majority of all semaphores) and it produces even 
smaller code (and we're all for smaller kernels, right?).
