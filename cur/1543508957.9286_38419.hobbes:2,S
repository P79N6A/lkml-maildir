  Hello.
  While reading buffer cache code I found one thing which I didn't understand.
In __bforget() there is a test whether buffer head is in use or is locked.
The test looks like:
        if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&buf->b_count) || buffer_locked(buf))
                goto in_use;
But I think it should be:
        if (atomic_dec_and_test(&buf->b_count)...))
                goto in_use;
Because buffer is in use when it has b_count > 0 and now whne b_count == 0.
Am I missing something?
							Honza.
