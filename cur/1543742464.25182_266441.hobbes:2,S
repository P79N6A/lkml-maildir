GOOD LORD you people a re fsking annoying.  You make these outrageous
claims that are based in nothing but your own deluded self-righteous
brain's skewed reality.
If you want a hamburger analogy, you're WAY off base.  The license of BK
is like McDonalds saying you can have all the free hamburgers you want,
but you can NOT have them if you are trying to recreate the secret sauce
recipe.
And again - IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE LICENSE, DON'T USE THE SOFTWARE.
And please, for the sake of GOD shut up.
