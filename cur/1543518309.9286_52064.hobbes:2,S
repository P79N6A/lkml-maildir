You shouldn't need that for the regular "load libc" case. When you do the
link, you have full knowledge of whether the program you linked tried to
override any weak symbols.
Or what am I missing?
Sure, a new libc may come along, and introduce _new_ weak symbols that
happen to clash with something you pre-linked. And yes, in such a case the
new weak symbols would not be overridden in the pre-linked case. But is
that really even an issue?
