Hi,
i have problems scaling down my p4 prescott 2.8 GHz.
In the /sys -tree all seems to be ok:
[ck@holodeck:cpufreq] pwd
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
[ck@holodeck:cpufreq] ls -1
cpuinfo_max_freq
cpuinfo_min_freq
scaling_available_frequencies
scaling_available_governors
scaling_driver
scaling_governor
scaling_max_freq
scaling_min_freq
scaling_setspeed

[ck@holodeck:cpufreq] cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Mhz
cpu MHz         : 2807.131
cpu MHz         : 2807.131
As you can see tools like cpudyn or powernowd successfully
change the entry in scaling_setspeed (also for cpu1),
but the real cpu clock stays at 2.8GHz ?
The cpudyn doc sais there's support for 'Intel Pentium 4, Intel Xeon'
CPU's, but is there support for p4 prescott ?
Has annyone here successfully scaled down a prescott ?
regards,
clee
