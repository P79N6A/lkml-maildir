Please, this could turn into a flamewar:
*	Users hate the NFS hangs.
*	Applications need them for consistency.
Is there really a solution that makes everyone happy
when NFS servers are down?  If so, I haven't seen it
in my career working with NFS.  (Unless NFS v3 helps ...)
All the network admins I've known choose non-interruptible,
tolerate the complaining users when a server is down,
and just work on getting the server back on-line ASAP.
