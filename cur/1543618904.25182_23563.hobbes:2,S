Well... not sure. I'd like this to be doable. I have worked
on some high-end broadcast video stuffs in the past, and we
did intensive use of direct bus master from the disk controller
to the framebuffer linear aperture. Actually, we even controlled
the scatter gather list to "sort" lines ;)
If the HW cause a fault, the disk controller should stop and
report an error, and the process should be signaled instead
of getting an oops, but I don't know these code path in linux
at all so...

Well. My point of view here is fix copy_to_user, but well...
