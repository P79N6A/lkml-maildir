Hi all,
I am maintaining the Debian package containing the preemptible kernel 
from Robert Love. 
A user told me that win4lin stops working when the preemptible patch is
used. He sent me a patch (see below); I have tested it on my computer it
seems to work, however I don't understand exactly what it does. 
Could anybody can give me some comments on this patch and the possible
consequences it could generate?
Thanks
Aurelien
