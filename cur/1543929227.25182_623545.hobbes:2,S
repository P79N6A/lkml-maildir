Hi Linus,
Before rc4, please pull from: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
This fixes the Thinkpad T61 OOPS regression due to the -rc3 thermal changes.
It also fixes a boot crash in the AML interpreter that has been with us forever,
but has recently been exposed by acpi-cpufreq on some new platforms.
This will update the files shown below.
thanks!
-Len

    ACPICA: fix acpi-cpufreq boot crash due to _PSD return-by-reference
    
    Changed resolution of named references in packages
    
    Fixed a problem with the Package operator where all named
    references were created as object references and left otherwise
    unresolved. According to the ACPI specification, a Package can
    only contain Data Objects or references to control methods. The
    implication is that named references to Data Objects (Integer,
    Buffer, String, Package, BufferField, Field) should be resolved
    immediately upon package creation. This is the approach taken
    with this change. References to all other named objects (Methods,
    Devices, Scopes, etc.) are all now properly created as reference objects.

    ACPI: Delete the IRQ operation in throttling controll via PTC
    
    The IRQ operation(enable/disable) should be avoided when throttling is
    controlled via PTC method. It is replaced by the migration of task.
    
    This fixes an oops on T61 -- a regression due to
    f79f06ab9f86 b/c FixedHW support tried to read remote MSR with interrupts disabled.
