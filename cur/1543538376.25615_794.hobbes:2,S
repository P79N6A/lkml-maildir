Well, sometimes I don't care if the kernel kills some processes because of
a memory hog. But it should kill things like the hog itself or big
applications. 
What I do *not* understand is why it hapilly kills system management
processes like syslogd, inetd or sendmail, when they don't use much memory
or CPU, making my machine useless.
It's trivial for any user to bring the system to an unusable state:
for(;;) malloc(1);
...and boom! In 15 seconds there's no more inetd, logins, http, etc :(
