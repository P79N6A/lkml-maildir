	You can't violate the DMCA on a GPL'd work. At least, if there's a way to
do, I couldn't find it. See some of the previous posts on this list about
whether the DMCA meant you couldn't remove the GPL tag on exported symbols.
The GPL explicitly permits you to modify the code as you wish, and this
includes removing any restriction or enforcement type code.
