Does it mean that nobody cares to fix errors in assembler code? Do we have
to keep special compiler for kernel only? It seems that gcc-2.95.x is the
official GNU C compiler, isn't it? May be I'm wrong (I doubt), but I do
think that it's a good thing to get the kernel buildable with the official
compiler... EGCS had not been the official GNU C compiler, so one can make
an excuse kinda "don't use something unofficial", but this is not a case
with gcc-2.95.x...

Did you try to build a kernel with gcc-2.95.1? Have you seen that whole
bunch of assembler warnings during the build? May be those warnings can
explain (at least partially) why don't the resulting kernel behave?
