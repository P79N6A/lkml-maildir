Stacked GIT 0.14 release is available from 
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
This release requires at least Python 2.4 and GIT 1.5.2.
The main features in this release:
    * Support for correctly running StGIT in subdirectories
    * 'repair' command for fixing an StGIT repository modified by GIT
commands such as 'commit', 'pull', 'merge' or 'rebase'
    * 'edit' command for editing both the patch description and diff
    * Support for SMTP over TLS
    * Support for MIME multipart e-mail templates
    * '--attach' option to the 'mail' command to send a patch attached
rather than inline
    * Diff statistics and shortlog added to the cover e-mail template
    * '--sign/ack' options to the 'import' and 'new' commands
    * '--number' to the 'log' command for limiting the output
    * Support for binary files in patches
    * Support for detached HEAD
    * Refactoring of some modules with better support for debugging
    * Many bug-fixes
