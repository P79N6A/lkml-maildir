As I recall (and I'll test tonight) it didn't make a difference if I
chose just the PIII config, or if I compiled for I386 on up to PIII
using the new selection stuff.  Check the .config I posted before.  
I've got a laptop here, so maybe I can configure the serial console
and get a copy of the boot messages so I can post them.  We'll see if
I get a chance to do this tongiht.
Right now, 2.6.1-mm5 is compiling, I should be testing it, then
2.6.2-rc1 in an hour.
