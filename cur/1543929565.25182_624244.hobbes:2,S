David Holmes found a bug in the RT patch with respect to
pthread_cond_timedwait. After trying his test program on the latest git
from mainline, I found the bug was there too.  The bug he was seeing
that his test program showed, was that if one were to do a "Ctrl-Z" on a
process that was in the pthread_cond_timedwait, and then did a "bg" on
that process, it would return with a "-ETIMEDOUT" but early. That is,
the timer would go off early.
Looking into this, I found the source of the problem. And it is a rather
nasty bug at that.
Here's the relevant code from kernel/futex.c: (not in order in the file)
[...]
smlinkage long sys_futex(u32 __user *uaddr, int op, u32 val,
                          struct timespec __user *utime, u32 __user *uaddr2,
                          u32 val3)
{
        struct timespec ts;
        ktime_t t, *tp = NULL;
        u32 val2 = 0;
        int cmd = op & FUTEX_CMD_MASK;
        if (utime && (cmd == FUTEX_WAIT || cmd == FUTEX_LOCK_PI)) {
                if (copy_from_user(&ts, utime, sizeof(ts)) != 0)
                        return -EFAULT;
                if (!timespec_valid(&ts))
                        return -EINVAL;
                t = timespec_to_ktime(ts);
                if (cmd == FUTEX_WAIT)
                        t = ktime_add(ktime_get(), t);
                tp = &t;
        }
[...]
        return do_futex(uaddr, op, val, tp, uaddr2, val2, val3);
}
[...]
long do_futex(u32 __user *uaddr, int op, u32 val, ktime_t *timeout,
                u32 __user *uaddr2, u32 val2, u32 val3)
{
        int ret;
        int cmd = op & FUTEX_CMD_MASK;
        struct rw_semaphore *fshared = NULL;
        if (!(op & FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG))
                fshared = &current->mm->mmap_sem;
        switch (cmd) {
        case FUTEX_WAIT:
                ret = futex_wait(uaddr, fshared, val, timeout);

               struct restart_block *restart;
                restart = &current_thread_info()->restart_block;
                restart->fn = futex_wait_restart;
                restart->arg0 = (unsigned long)uaddr;
                restart->arg1 = (unsigned long)val;
                restart->arg2 = (unsigned long)abs_time;
                restart->arg3 = 0;
                if (fshared)
                        restart->arg3 |= ARG3_SHARED;
                return -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK;
[...]
static long futex_wait_restart(struct restart_block *restart)
{
        u32 __user *uaddr = (u32 __user *)restart->arg0;
        u32 val = (u32)restart->arg1;
        ktime_t *abs_time = (ktime_t *)restart->arg2;
        struct rw_semaphore *fshared = NULL;
        restart->fn = do_no_restart_syscall;
        if (restart->arg3 & ARG3_SHARED)
                fshared = &current->mm->mmap_sem;
        return (long)futex_wait(uaddr, fshared, val, abs_time);
}
So when the futex_wait is interrupt by a signal we break out of the
hrtimer code and set up or return from signal. This code does not return
back to userspace, so we set up a RESTARTBLOCK.  The bug here is that we
save the "abs_time" which is a pointer to the stack variable "ktime_t t"
from sys_futex.
This returns and unwinds the stack before we get to call our signal. On
return from the signal we go to futex_wait_restart, where we update all
the parameters for futex_wait and call it. But here we have a problem
where abs_time is no longer valid.
I verified this with print statements, and sure enough, what abs_time
was set to ends up being garbage when we get to futex_wait_restart.
The solution I did to solve this is to allocate a temporary buffer when
setting up the block and free it in futex_wait_restart. This patch
allows David's test program to actually pass.
