The objection was to dilution of developer effort towards one cpu scheduler to 
rule them all. Linus' objection was against specialisation - he preferred one 
cpu scheduler that could do everything rather than unique cpu schedulers for 
NUMA, SMP, UP, embedded... Each approach has its own arguments and there 
isn't much point bringing them up again. We shall use Linux as the 
"steamroller to crack a nut" no matter what that nut is.

I could find no difference either, but IA64 which does not cope with 
indirection well would probably suffer a demonstrable performance hit I have 
been told. I do not have access to such hardware.

Nice pun.
