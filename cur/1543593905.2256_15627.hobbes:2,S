Assuming you did compile an executable, not just try to execute the .o file,
then your filesystem probably corrupted the executable. Building and linking
programs stresses parts of the filesystem that your other tests cannot
reach. In particular, it does lots of seeking and writing to places other
than the end of the file, which isn't trivial to do from a shell script. 
Try running the attached test program.
