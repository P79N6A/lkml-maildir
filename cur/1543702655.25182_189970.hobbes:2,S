hi,
I recently got my hands on a system with a realtek 8180l-based wireless 
network card (billionton miwlrp, [1]). There is a closed source driver from 
realtek, however it does not support 2.6 (yet, probably) and seems to be 
quite buggy.
Having read a thread [2] about this, in which mr. Jeff Garzik seemed to imply 
that he was working with the realtek people to create an open source driver, 
I was wondering if anybody could confirm the existance of such an initiative.
If it exists I'd like to offer my help, both towards developping (I'm a 
newbie, but I'd be happy to learn :) and/or testing.
thanks in advance
