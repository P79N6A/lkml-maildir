Hi,
When I call sys_clone() inside the kernel, the new (child) process
occupied all the CPU time and other processes don't have much
chance to run (the mouse moves very slow...).  I did set the
interrupt flags on and set the field "priority" and "counter" in
the task_struct  to the default value but it still didn't work
Would any of you have any suggestions?
Thanks a lot.
Viet
