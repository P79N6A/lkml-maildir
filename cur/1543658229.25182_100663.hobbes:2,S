    You *chose* GNU/Linux to parallel Unix? I assume you mean that you
    influenced GNU into using a Unix base with the eventual goal of having
    some sort of GNU Unix base (the Hurd?). The words you selected above
    are rather assuming.
I decided in 1983 to develop a Unix-compatible operating system, and
then chose the name GNU for it.  In 1990, after finding or writing
most of the necessary components, we started developing a kernel for
the GNU system; that kernel is the GNU Hurd.  Since Linux was working
long before the Hurd, people mostly use GNU with Linux instead.
See

 for the history of GNU.
