Hello !
I want to get linux 2.4.25 running on my server, whitch currently uses 
2.2.20.
I've read /linux-2.4.25/Documentation/Changes and it seems
that everything required is ok.
But.
My server has Pentium MMX in it. So when I compile the 2.4.25 kernel 
with all defaults (i use menuconfig), it fails on startup. Just reboots 
the PC, and I can't see anything. I've googled through linux-kernel 
archives and got the idea that I've not configured the Processor type 
correctly. Ok, I choose Pentium MMX from menu (as my old 2.2.20 reports 
in /proc/cpuinfo) and try to compile the kernel. All the other kernel 
settings are default.
It fails ! Here's the log. I've tested that on my workstation with some 
new cool fast processor and it says the same:

.... and so on.....
I can send the whole stderr output if that's not enough.
It seems to me that one can easily reproduce all this error and 
warning messages that I've got. Just set Pentinum MMX processor and 
leave all the other settings default.
So, how should I understand this ? Have I done something wrong ? Is that 
a bug in kernel ? Can I run 2.4.25 on Pentium MMX?
Please, advice me something, hope you can easily reproduce the bug.
Thanx in advance !
