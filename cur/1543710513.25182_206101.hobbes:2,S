This actually is largely a question of architecture-dependent code, so
the answer will depend on whether your architecture matches those of the
others who have had a need to arrange this.
Basically, all you really need to do is to check the vma and call either
a hugetlb-specific fault handler or handle_mm_fault() depending on whether
hugetlb is configured. Once you've gotten that far, it's only a question
of implementing the methods to work together properly when driven by
upper layers.
The reason why this wasn't done up-front was that there wasn't a
demonstrable need to do so. The issue you're citing is exactly the kind
of demonstration needed to motivate its inclusion.
