struct sigevent is defined like this:
typedef struct sigevent {
         sigval_t sigev_value;
         int sigev_signo;
         int sigev_notify;
         union {
                 int _pad[SIGEV_PAD_SIZE];
                  int _tid;
                 struct {
                         void (*_function)(sigval_t);
                         void *_attribute;       /* really pthread_attr_t */
                 } _sigev_thread;
         } _sigev_un;
} sigevent_t;
For the SIGEV_KEVENT case:
   sigev_notify is set to SIGEV_KEVENT (obviously)
   sigev_value can be used for the void* data passed along with the
   signal, just like in the case of a signal delivery
Now you need a way to specify the kevent descriptor.  Just add
   int _kevent;
inside the union and if you want
   #define sigev_kevent_descr _sigev_un._kevent
That should be all.
