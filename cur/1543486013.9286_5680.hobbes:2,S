This is what I don't understand.. the only function of this message is to cause
confusion for 99% of the users and putting "-- MARK --" in the system logs just
to show that the system is actually still alive is pretty useless and just
takes up disk space. Sure, you can turn it off, but I really think it should be
off by default.
I always rip the code out of syslogd whenever I compile it, and I'd bet a lot
of others do too.
