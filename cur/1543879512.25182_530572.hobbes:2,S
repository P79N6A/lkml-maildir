I think that would violate at least the spirit of the ACPI spec.
The example in section 11.6 of the ACPI 3.0 spec shows a _TMP
method that runs an EC method to read the temp, and the EC ioport
usage is correctly declared in the EC device's _CRS method.
Of course, there are always BIOS defects.  But if we could make a
case that a BIOS that doesn't declare the resources used by the AML
is defective, we could add quirks to reserve the undeclared resources.
Chuck's last update (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/20/136
) says his
problem turned out to be unrelated to k8temp and may have gone away
after a BIOS update.

This might solve it, but doesn't seem like a clean way to do it.
I don't like the idea of sharing a lock between drivers and ACPI.
k8temp happens to be x86-dependent, so we'll always have ACPI, but
in principle, we could have the same problem with an arch-independent
PCI driver that only has ACPI on x86 and ia64 platforms.
(BTW, if Chuck's problem was solved by the BIOS update, I assume
there *is* another instance of the problem that we're trying to
solve with this lock.)
