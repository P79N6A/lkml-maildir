Ok, I couldn't help but try it. I've got a 2G bochs disk image for Debian
(really a 250M holey file) I can copy and throw away.
A `rm -rfv *` as root from / does:
(removes a bunch of files, including "rm" from bin and so forth), then loops printing:
removing all entries of directory `dev/pts'
removing the directory itself `dev/pts'
removing all entries of directory `dev/pts'
removing the directory itself `dev/pts'
removing all entries of directory `dev/pts'
removing the directory itself `dev/pts'
removing all entries of directory `dev/pts'
removing the directory itself `dev/pts'
removing all entries of directory `dev/pts'
removing the directory itself `dev/pts'
It's apparently having issues with removing the mount point of the devpts
filesystem.
