This sounds great, to me.
One minor question: is it even possible to be completely fair on SMP?
For instance, if you have a 2-way SMP box running 3 applications, one of
which has 2 threads, will the threaded app have an advantage here?  (The
current system seems to try to keep each thread on a specific CPU, to
reduce cache thrashing, which means threads and processes alike each
get 50% of the CPU.)
