Unfortunately, all the code in the dik_* functions depends on the registers
being passed in, as far as I can tell. When panic() is called, the registers are
not included in the arguments. I think somehow I need to get the PC and RA (r26)
from the previous stack frame or something.
I was hoping to get the registers from PALcode, but I don't see any way of doing
that, other than halting the processor, which would give me the info I need in
the HWRPB. The last thing done in panic() is a halt, is there a way to do that
and then have the PALcode jump to my routine? Of course, even if this worked,
the PC and RA in the HWRPB would just be from the panic() routine; I need those
addresses from the function that *called* panic() !
