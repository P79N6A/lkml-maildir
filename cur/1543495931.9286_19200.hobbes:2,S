When the heck is the latest epic100 driver going to be put in 2.2??  I just
got bit again doing a new kernel install because I forgot to get version
1.06 (1.04 has problems).  It's been available since Feb 98!!
I've e-mailed it to Linus before so now I'm begging...PLEASE get this in the
kernel release!!

Version 1.07 is also out there but I haven't tested it yet:
