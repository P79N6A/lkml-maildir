Not fixed in any update you sent to your original patch, in
the past three weeks, that's the key point.  In particular,
the number one issue was completely ignored.  (Your recent
responses haven't come across to me as helpful either..)

So, when I said that sysfs doesn't use names like "gpio-19" but instead
uses names like "gpio19" ... exactly what don't you agree with?
Your examples prove what I *did* say.  I don't know who you're trying
to argue with on other points, however.

Which is fine.  The $SUBJECT patch provides a simple solution for it.
As well as for the other use cases I sketched.  With identifiers that
are much simpler, and harder to get wrong.

Those are *NOT* my words.  Again, I don't know what straw man you
are arguing with, but please stop painting my face on it, putting
your words in its mouth, and using that to claim you're disproving
something I've "said" (but haven't).
I did say your problem could be solved ... but with different
identifier syntax than you suggested.

Right, and since I *can* do stuff like that in busybox with ASH,
that quickly, I hope you'll agree your flamage has been blowing
things way out of proportion here.

Elaborated in my reply to Ben; see that.

Userspace being able to MODIFY the direction and output value
is most certainly mucking around!!!

It's a question of how easy you make it to break things.
You seem to draw the "too easy" line differently than I do.
I don't want *anything* else mucking around with state my
drivers are responsible for managing.
