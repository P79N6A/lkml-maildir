OK, to be honest, I never fully understood the concept of this
"simple_irq". I figured it was because of the ARM architecture.
Your arguments seem reasonable and you are probably correct. But I didn't
write this code, nor do I understand it, and before I go ahead and change
it, I'll wait to hear input from Thomas. Hopefully, he'll be back soon.
Perhaps my confusion about the simple_irq part is from the bug you are
trying to fix. I've been confused by why it was different ;-)
