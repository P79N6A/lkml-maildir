IIRC plex86 requires quite large module on the host. And I am not sure
it's does not have any privilegies. Umlinux requires no or very minimal
(thus easy to check for insecurities) patch to kernel and does not need
any privilegies (except the helper that sets up networking, but that's
pretty minimalistic too). If you properly chroot the umlinux process,
it's very secure (the skas mode will only work in chroot once it's made
to use syscall).
