Hi there!
I found a bug in the via-velocity driver, but I cant find a maintainer for that, so I write to the lists.
This driver depends on CONFIG_INET (tcp/ip) if CONFIG_PM is enabled.
This is tested on i386 and x86_64.
I'm not familiar with network stuff but I don't believe a device should depend on a protocol.
If you are interested to fix it:
make allnoconfig
enable CONFIG_PCI
enable CONFIG_NET
enable CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
enable CONFIG_NET_PCI
enable CONFIG_VIA_VELOCITY
make
That only happens when CONFIG_PM is enabled. If it's switched off it won't happen.
Greets,
Henne
