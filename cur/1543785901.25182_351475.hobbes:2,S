I am trying to say that I think that Hans is being treated a bit unfairly.
His fs is new and has fairly complex on-disk structure and complex journalling
machinery, yet his source and object code is smaller than xfs which already
is accepted. This is no easy feat I guess.
Maybe xfs shouldn't be accepted too, this may be an answer.
Let's look at the code. Hans' code is not _that_ awful. Yet people
(not all of them, but some) do not point to specific things which they
want to be fixed/improved. I see blanket arguments like "your code is hard
to read". Well. Maybe spend a minute on what exactly is hard to read,
or do we require Hans to be able to read minds from the distance?
This is it. I do not say "accept reiser4 NOW", I am saying "give Hans
good code review".
