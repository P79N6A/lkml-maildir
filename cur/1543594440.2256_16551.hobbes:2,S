Actually, they don't hang _immediately_. They report:
eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0050  0000 at 6022/6034 commands 000c0000
000c0000 000c0000
Command 0000 was not immediately accepted, 10001 ticks!
And the ssh connection stalls but does on trying (it eventually hangs, but
not after a lot of errors are reported on the problem-box's console)
And then the box hard locks. Interesting to see that only when I run the
ssh ls -lR is that any error at all is produced. The lockups I was seeing
were all interactive use and I never really noticed if errors were showing
up or not; I just assumed they weren'.
Any help you can provide is very much appreciated. I'm about to try
Intel's drivers to see how they do.
Take care,
