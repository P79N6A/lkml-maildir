I recommend we just delete the pci_bus class.  I don't think it serves
any useful purpose.  The bridge can be inferred frmo the sysfs hierarchy
(not to mention lspci will tell you).  The cpuaffinity file should be
moved from the bus to the device -- it really doesn't make any sense to
talk about which cpu a bus is affine to, only a device.
