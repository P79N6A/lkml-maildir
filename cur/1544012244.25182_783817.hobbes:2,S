An experimental marking is no excuse for being broken.

This seems broken to me.  The only way for a process to get into
RR mode is if it had been set by someone with the right privileges
or if it was inherited from its parent.
So having a default where such a process stops executing altogether
after performing a setuid is wrong.
The default should be to give each user a non-zero allotment.

Well the program which this was based on, asterisk does check for
errors on setuid.  However, even if setuid did return an error this
isn't much better than the status quo since the user will be left
with the question "why on earth is asterisk failing on setuid?".
