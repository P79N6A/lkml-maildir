It should, the problem is if someone has plugged higher up in the
hierarchy, then you do need the explicit replug to drain that before
going to sleep and waiting for IO to complete. Not very happy about that
situation, I'd prefer if that happened automagically. I'll likely change
the code to fix that, so we don't have to sprinkle
blk_replug_current_nested() and always call io_schedule() instead of
schedule(). It's just going to cause too many problems.
