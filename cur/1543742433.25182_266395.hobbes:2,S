this particular one (atomicity-checking) is always-enabled if you have
the -RT patch applied (it's a really cheap check).
for the 'application-triggered tracing' facility we talked about earlier
is only active if LATENCY_TRACING is enabled. In that case to turn the 
tracer on, call:
	gettimeofday(0,1);
and to turn the tracer off and save the current trace into 
/proc/latency_trace, call:
	gettimeofday(0,0);
or apply the patch below - i've added the tracer bits too. I've added a
simple limit: all delays above 2 msec will be saved - you might want to
do a maximum search there or something. And dont forget to:
	echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
to activate the jackd-triggered kernel tracer.
