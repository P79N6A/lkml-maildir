If we got at this point, we :
Found a non NULL pointer in our fd table.
Then, another thread came, closed the file while we not yet added our reference.
This file was freed (kmem_cache_free(filp_cachep, file))
This file was reused and inserted on another thread fd table.
We added our reference on refcount.
We checked if this file is still ours (in our fd tab).
We found this file is not anymore the file we wanted.
Calling put_filp() here is our only choice to safely remove the reference on
a truly allocated file. At this point the file is
a truly allocated file but not anymore ours.
Unfortunatly we added a reference on it : we must release it.
If the other thread already called put_filp() because it wanted to close its new file,
we must see f_refcnt going to zero, and we must call __fput(), to perform
all the relevant file cleanup ourself.

I see your point. But currently, any thread can be "releasing the last
reference on a file". That is not always the thread that called close(fd)
We extend this to "any thread of any process", so it might have
a security effect you are absolutely right.

Any real world program that open and close files, or said better,
that close and open files :)
sizeof(struct file) is 192 bytes. Thats three cache lines.
Being able to reuse a hot "struct file" avoids three cache line misses.
Thats about 120 ns.
Then, using call_rcu() is also a latency killer, since we explicitly say :
I dont want to free this file right now, I delegate this job to another layer
in two or three milli second (or more)
A final point is that SLUB doesnt need to allocate or free a slab in many cases.
(This is probably why Christoph needed this patch in 2006 :) )
In my case, I need all these patches to speedup http servers.
They obviously open and close many files per second.
The added code has a cost of less than 3 ns, but I suspect we can cut it to less than 1ns
We prefered with Christoph and Paul to keep patch as short as possible to focus
on essential points.

We could avoid doing the full test, because there is no way the files->max_fds could
become lower under us, or even fdt itself, and fdt->fd
So instead of using twice this function :
static inline struct file * fcheck_files(struct files_struct *files, unsigned int fd)
{
        struct file * file = NULL;
        struct fdtable *fdt = files_fdtable(files);
        if (fd < fdt->max_fds)
                file = rcu_dereference(fdt->fd[fd]);
        return file;
}
We could use the attached patch
This becomes a matter of three instructions, including a 99.99% predicted branch :
c0287646:       8b 03                   mov    (%ebx),%eax
c0287648:       39 45 e4                cmp    %eax,-0x1c(%ebp)
c028764b:       74 a1                   je     c02875ee <fget+0x3e>
c028764d:       8b 45 e4                mov    -0x1c(%ebp),%eax
c0287650:       e8 fb fd ff ff          call   c0287450 <put_filp>
c0287655:       31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax
c0287657:       eb 98                   jmp    c02875f1 <fget+0x41>
	
At the time Christoph sent its patch (in 2006), nobody cared, because
we had no benchmark or real world workload that demonstrated the gain 
of his patch, only intuitions.
We had too many contended cache lines that slow down the whole process.
SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is a must on current hardware, where memory cache line
misses costs become really problematic. This patch series clearly demonstrate
it.
Thanks Nick for your feedback and comments.

[PATCH] fs: optimize fget() & fget_light()
Instead of calling fcheck_files() a second time, we can take into account we
already did part of the job, in a rcu read locked section. We need a
struct file **filp pointer so that we only dereference it a second time.
