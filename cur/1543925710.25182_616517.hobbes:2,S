Because it is easier to solve if there is only one non-privileged user:
you just give them privilege (fun with chmod and sudo) to edit the
system policies, and you're done (assuming you are happy allowing the
non-privileged user to edit policy at all).
If there are lots of non-privileged users sharing a computer, then I
submit that solutions are either insecure, intractable, or purely
restrictive.

Ok, I can see where that would be useful in theory. But solving it is
VERY hard in practice, and AppArmor is not attempting to address this
problem of user extensibility of mandatory access controls.
