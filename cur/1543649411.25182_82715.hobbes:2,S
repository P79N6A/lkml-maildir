In 2.5.41every architecture except Intel 386 has a "#define cli 
<something>" in its asm-arch/system.h file.  Is there supposed to be such a 
define in asm-i386/system.h?  If not, where does the "official" definition 
of cli() live for Intel?  Or what is the include file that one needs to 
pick it up?  I can't find it.
Thanks,
Dave
