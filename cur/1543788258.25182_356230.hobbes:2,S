Thanks for the support.
Just to clarify a little, the main reason (from my point of view) that
Suspend2 hasn't been merged prior to now is that I haven't asked for
that. I have sought code reviews a couple of times, and have really
appreciated the feedback. But so far I haven't sought for the code to be
merged. This has been for a number of reasons:
First, I've been seeking to make it as mature and bug free as I can
prior to the merge so that the merge itself creates as few problems as
possible. Part of this has involved spending a long time cleaning up
code, improving the commenting and so on.
Second, getting it in a form that Andrew and Linus can use involves
preparing a git tree for them to pull from, and this requires splitting
the patches up into discrete functions and pairs of functions. Doing
this and writing descriptions for each patch has also taken a long time,
especially because Suspend is by no means the only thing I do with my
life (although my wife sometimes feels otherwise!).
So, then, at least part of the blame for Suspend2 not being merged yet
must lie with me, sorry. I am seeking to address this, and trying not to
be too much of a perfectionist, but it will take a little bit longer
yet.
Of course even when I think I'm ready, it doesn't mean others will
agree, so don't expect it to happen the instant I become satisfied :).
Regards,
Nigel
