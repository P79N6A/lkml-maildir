Yes, Thanks, it does.  I actually fixed the code in a similar way last night, 
but didn't submit this code since the bridge detection still looks accidental: 
 the code finds several non host bridge devices on subordinate bus 1 which 
cause `found' to be set to one but never increment `cnt'  Fortunatley, cnt has 
already been incremented by the two host bridge devices found on bus 0
