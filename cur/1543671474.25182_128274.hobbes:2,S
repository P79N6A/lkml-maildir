There are even in bigger companies already many production machines
running Linux. I don't say that it's impossible for them to switch to a
different OS, but this would be a non-trivial switch (if this is
critical infrastructure) and a non-cheap (both for training the staff
for a different OS and for buying soft- and perhaps hardware) switch.
