Given that I do not touch core kernel and most of spinlocks I ever
did were in drivers - yes, they are there to protect me from IRQ
handler races.

No.
I say that writing kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC) takes more time to verify
that it is needed compared to hypothetical kmalloc_auto(size),
and yet kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC) is worse in a sense thet it won't sleep
even if it happens to be called outside locks.
Think about this:
/* may be called under spinlock */
void do_something() {
	/* we need to alloc here */
}

Where did I say "let's use GFP_ATOMIC everywhere" ?
