Subject: [PATCH] linux-2.5.39_timer-changes_A3 (1/3 - infrastructure)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, Dave, all,
	This is part 1 of 3 of my timer-changes patch. Nothing new in this
release, but I broke it up considerably to try to aid people who might
attempt to read over it. 
As I've said before, this collection of patches breaks up the i386
time.c using a timer_ops structure to abstract away the different time
sources used (such as TSC, PIT, and in the future HPET, cyclone,
ACPIpm). 
Part 1 is just the infrastructure required (struct timer_ops,
select_timer()), and changes no existing code.
Please apply.
thanks
