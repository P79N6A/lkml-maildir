Looking a code generated from fragments, I don't think gcc shares that
opinion ;-) Actually I find it more obvious with the ? notation, and it
prevents someone in the future changing the logic in one line of code when
it needs to change in both.
Oh well, I expect the ? form to stay, since it uses less cache.
