If there is a list separated usual one, driver can choice which region 
to check or not. However, in general, maybe almost all driver will regist 
all region it has.
Agree, I'll use the pci_dev->resource. This is a realistic approach.

I see, this wouldn't cost so much. I'll use.

Sounds good. I think these naming are more better for peace porpose :-)

On ia64, readX_check() will be used to make sure that there has no MCA before 
read_pcix_errors(). I think we could use original plain readX() in place of 
readX_check() if we ignore checking accuracy or if the driver takes care to 
all loaded data. But I don't know how about this on other architecture.
I think inside of readX_check() would be mostly arch specified codes.
