Ouch.  Out of curiosity - what is the reason for this behavior in ld?

Using -print-file-name may cause problems if a system has libintl installed,
and the C library provides libintl support as well - you end up detecting
libintl, but linking to it isn't a good idea in that case.  Not to mention
figuring out which libintl to link to - static lib?  .so?  .dll (cygwin)?
Using a tempfile sounds like the right solution - you want to detect if
linking with -lintl is absolutely required, not just if the library exists.
Sam Ravenborg mentioned reimplementing this using check-lxdialog.sh.  I'll
wait and see what comes of that.
BTW - many thanks to all the folks who looked at this (admittedly trivial)
patch.  There's a level of professionalism and attention to detail in the
Linux community that's very refrehing.
