Yes, it is. Think about: (let ping be shell script)
# cp -a /bin/ping /tmp
user1$ ls -al /tmp/ping
rwsr-xr-x  ping
user1$ creates evil script to echo "user1evil:0:" into /etc/passwd
user1$ /tmp/ping &
kernel now starts executing /bin/bash /tmp/ping
but
user1$ mv -f /tmp/evil_script /tmp/ping
/tmp/ping had suid, /tmp/evil_script does not have suid, but shell
being launched already _runs_ suid
user1$ su user1evil
user1evil#
DO you see my point? You need to pass open fd of program being
executed to interpretter if you want suid scripts to work. This
vulnerability does _not_ exist with elf files.
