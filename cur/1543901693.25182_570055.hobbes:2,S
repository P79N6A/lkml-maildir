Old, I'd think. Note that this issue was hidden behind the fact that
we would call vfs_permission()->generic_permission() anyway even if
that check failed.
Now generic_permission() returns 0 (success) if capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE)
and -EACCES otherwise (that's for MAY_WRITE tests, which is what this
one is). Now I suspect most (all?) common userspace programs out there
just don't ever have a capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE) && !capable(CAP_FOWNER)
kind of capability mix, so we never saw this before.

Just code inspection. In fact I got interested in following this
codepath precisely after the recent discussion on this list ...

Yes, I thought of writing a helper function for this myself. The semantics
of CAP_FOWNER sort of justify that, but probably better to get Al's views
on this first.
