My guess is that it is a sort of optimization.  Most if not all
system services end up with a PID < 300 at boot time.  As long as
they don't get killed and restarted, they'll keep that PID.
Userland processes will come and go, and as such most PID's after
300 will be free to use again if PID just wrapped, whereas most
PID's under 300 have a higher chance of allready being used.
That is my guess anyways..
