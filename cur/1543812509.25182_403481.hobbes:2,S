You're missing some crucial information about how Linux operates.   
EXPORT_SYMBOL != extern.  Basically, Linux maintains a list of  
symbols that dynamically loaded modules are allowed to use, along  
with some technical usage restrictions on each  (Symbols exported  
with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL may only be used by modules that declare  
'MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");'.)  Exporting a symbol increases the  
likliehood that some module author will use it inappropriately, and  
bloats the kernel.  In this case, removing the EXPORT_SYMBOL() would  
be a good thing.
