Hi all,
I recently installed Debian on my Acer Travelmate 613 XTC and get the
following boot messages:
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
I checked the list archives and only found reports about that on SMP
machines or with some VIA chipset.
The kernel I use is 2.4.18, the chipset is some Intel 82815 controller.
Some other strange thing is, that the message occurs very often after a
cold reboot, but not after some warm reboot (e.g. after starting linux
after having run win2k)
The machine runs perfectly stable, I just thought someone out there
might be interested ;-)
Martin
