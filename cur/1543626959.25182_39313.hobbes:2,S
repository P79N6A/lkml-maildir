For some odd reason, the FSF doesn't like man pages. If you read the
info documentation for glibc, you'll find the _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
property listed in the "libc : System Configuration : Sysconf :
Constants for Sysconf" page. The man pages tend to lag behind the actual
info documentation, because they are maintained seperately.
