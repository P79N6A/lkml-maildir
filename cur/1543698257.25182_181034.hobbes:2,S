The only thing that looks at _all_ likely to explain the problem is

since there aren't that many XFS users I know of. It's also now the only
thing that uses buffer heads in your config, so..
I assume it's not an option to try another filesystem on this setup, but
it's entirely possible that the 2.6.x buffer-head removal has impacted XFS
negatively - although I'm a bit surprised at how easily you seem to show
problems, since XFS actually has active maintenance.
Nathan - I don't know if you follow linux-kernel, but Jerome Pinot has
been having bad slab problems for some time now. Do normal XFS users
compile with slab debugging turned on?
