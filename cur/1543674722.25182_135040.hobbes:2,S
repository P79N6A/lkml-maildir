Did you enable SysRq with
echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
If so, can you test if sysrq works while the system is not crashed?
In case SysRq doesn't work only after this crash, can you compile in the
NMI watchdog and boot with parameter
nmi_watchdog=1
That should print a backtrace if your system hangs hard and SysRq does
not work.
NOTE 1: You can see the backtrace only if you are not using X at that time.
NOTE 2: Your system will be dead after the NMI watchdog triggers. Please
write down the backtrace and pass it through ksymoops.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
