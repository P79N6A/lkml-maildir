I have one disk (containing the root partition) on the disk controller
on the motherboard, and a second disk on its own PCI (IDE) controller
  [ Promise Tech Chp, ATA 133 ]
Under 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 everything worked as soon as I plugged in the
card to the motherboard.
With either 2.4.21 or 2.6.0-test1, the OS doesnt seem to see the controller,
(no error messages), and you get down to a point where you are trying to
mount the disk partitions, and you get error messages saying /dev/hde does
not exist.
What changed?
Do I need an additional config line of some sort (Ive looked but dont see
anything?)
More details if necessary.
