As I modified it the clk_get() function it should be compatible with
the past, simply now it recognizes ALSO the format clkname.X to allow
a generic driver to have access to all clocks.
The other way to achieve this is to simulate a specific id in a fake
dev parameter, but it's awful.
For the driver to be generic, all low-level drivers should recognize
the clkname.X format. But this is the standard syntax for devices
name, so I think this should be correct.
Also clk_for_each() and clk_name() should be added to clock
infrastructure, so they should be implemented in all drivers.
Maybe this should be proposed and discussed with the clock
infrastructure maintainer, but I didn't find him in the MAINTAINER
list. Do you know who is ?
Where do you think the generic user access driver should be placed ?
