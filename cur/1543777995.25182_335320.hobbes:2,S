Subject: 2.6.13-rc3 Battery times at 100/250/1000 Hz = Zero difference
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'd gladly (ehum..) redo this mind-numbingly boring test if someone can
point me to a magic software which unleashes some untapped powersaving
feature of the CPU.
_Kernel 2.6.13-rc3 Boot to Death_:
2h48m at 100 HZ
2h48m at 250 HZ
2h47m at 1000 HZ
_"Load"_:
#!/bin/sh
touch time-hz-start
while (true) do
    touch time-hz-end
    sleep 1m
done
_Environment_:
No distro (LFS-ish pure 64 bit), no X, no network, no cronjobs, no
peripherals attached. Screen off by hardware switch, but disk obviously
spinning all the time. powernow_k8 + cpufreq_userspace + powernowd-0.96
= 800 MHz at "idle". Fan(s?) always on unless room temperature falls to
a slightly chilly level.
_Machine_:
Acer Aspire 1520 (1524) WLMi, AMD Athlon 64 3400+ (socket 754 according
to dmidecode-2.6). L1 64K/64K, L2 1024K, 512MB DDR RAM. Manufacturing
date 18 March 2005. Bought 20 May 2005. Battery used to full drain ca 5
times prior to this test (after the initial 3 charge/drains to reach its
full potential). "cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info":
present:                 yes
design capacity:         4000 mAh
last full capacity:      4000 mAh
battery technology:      rechargeable
design voltage:          14800 mV
design capacity warning: 400 mAh
design capacity low:     120 mAh
capacity granularity 1:  280 mAh
capacity granularity 2:  3880 mAh
model number:            Bat 8Cell
serial number:           236
battery type:            Lion
OEM info:                Acer
