I've looked the two patches which you've queued in the -mm branch, and
they look correct to me.
The bugs fixed by these patches can potentially lead to filesystem
corruption, since we ultimately use these fields to set the superblock
values.  This in my mind makes them stable candidates at the very
least, and if we weren't so late in the 2.6.28 cycle, I'd be strongly
tempted to push them to Linus as a bugfix before the merge window.
Andrew, any strong objections for me to grab them for the ext4 tree?
Or would you rather carry them?  I would prefer that they get pushed
to Linus as soon as the merge window opens, which is one reason why
I'd prefer carry them, but we can do this either way.
