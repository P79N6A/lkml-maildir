That seemed to solve the drifting problem, but I still get some weird
behavior.  The max reported trace in dmesg still does not
match /proc/latency_trace:
( posix_cpu_timer-3    |#0): new 38 us maximum-latency wakeup.
preemption latency trace v1.1.5 on 2.6.17-rt1-smp-latency-trace
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 latency: 19 us, #74/74, CPU#0 | (M:rt VP:0, KP:0, SP:1 HP:1 #P:2)
    -----------------
    | task: posix_cpu_timer-3 (uid:0 nice:0 policy:1 rt_prio:99)
