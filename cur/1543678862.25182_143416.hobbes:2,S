Works for me, I wanted to hijack pci_dev->slot_name (or the equivalent) so
we print both domain:bus:devfn as well as the system location on ppc64.
The system location makes it easier to work out which slot the card is in.
I dont necessarily need pci_name() since I could do what I want if
pci_dev->slot_name becomes a pointer.
