When you run out of RAM, or the RAM can be put to better use than keeping
stale process data around (you do realize that program code is paged
directly from the executable, don't you?).

There is: Max out the RAM on your machine. Don't ever run large processes.
Don't ever read large files.

Use a regular filesystem for /tmp, Linux is pretty good at caching file
data. If it isn't enough, complain /with data/ and /details/ of how it
isn't enough...

OK. But in any case, this is rare? So it would make not that much of a
difference...

Again, I fail to see the point.

Right.

Desired, yes; but not all desires can (or deserve to) be granted...

The overhead is not "just" runtime overhead, it is also developer time
consumption, it is more complex testing (need to check it works
with/without), ...

I've given no proof that "just another knob" is a bad idea either, but the
road to massive suckage is paved with "just another little feature"...
