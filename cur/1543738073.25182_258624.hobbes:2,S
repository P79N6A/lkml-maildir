That's fine.  Serge, can you enlighten us with an idea of the users of
this code?

Absolutely.

One portion of the vserver project (that which has to do with security
and isolation) could be largely covered by this work.  And vserver
is an active project with many users AFAICT.  The vserver maintainer
has expressed some interest in this as well.  The other portion of the
project, which does the resource limiting has a decent chance of working
well with something like CKRM or similar.

I agree, some userbase does wonders to justify mainlining the code.
