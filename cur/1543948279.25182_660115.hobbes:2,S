Ok. I've spent some time testing this. The good news is that with the nv
driver, s2ram as available from suspend.sf.net works, when run without
parameters on a 32-bit 2.6.24.3.
The bad news, however, is that it segfaults reliably after "Calling
get_mode" when I run it on 2.6.25-rc3. GDB shows that the segmentation
fault happens in the libx86 library, but as the version I use doesn't
have debug symbols, I don't have a complete backtrace. I'll try to
compile a version of libx86 tomorrow evening with debug symbols, and
return with a proper backtrace.
I have also tried to bisect the problem (its somewhere between 2.6.24
and 2.6.25rc1, quite a large span). However reverting the resulting
commit didn't solve the problem, I suspect I took a wrong turn
somewhere. I'll try to redo the bisection also tomorrow evening.
So I'll return with a proper bug report tomorrow (in its own thread). I
just wanted to give a heads up, if the above makes sense to anyone ;-)
