What I was saying in my first email was we can throttle "patches"
arbitrarily (I think Andrew/Linus even have a merge period for these
types of patches) ..  So that's not the issue .. I feel style clean ups
are fundamentally good.. So what we don't want to do is discourage the
creation of good patches, which is what I think Andi is doing..
If there's something in checkpatch.pl that you think is "Not All That
Important", than send a patch to remove those cases and we can discuss
that directly.. I'm not saying the tool is perfect..
