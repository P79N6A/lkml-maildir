Subject: aic7xxx 5.1.26 still doesn't work for WDIGTL WDE18310

Last working version was 5.1.21.
5.1.26 does work with my seagate Model: ST318203LW       Rev: 0001,
But a mkfs on the entire disk on my 
Western Digi: Model: WDE18310 ULTRA2  Rev: 1.30
causes continuous SCSI timeouts and bus resets.
Controller: AIC7890.  SMP, 2xPIII.  This was tested against 2.2.15pre5
(which works with 5.1.21 brought forward from 2.2.13).
