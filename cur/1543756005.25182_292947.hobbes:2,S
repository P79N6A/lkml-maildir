This doesn't work because net/core/dst.c can only search based
on dst->dev.  For the split device case, dst->dev is set to
loopback_dev while rt6i_idev is set to the real device.
Therefore net/core/dst.c stands no chance of finding the correct
local address routes that it needs to process.
If we wanted to preserve the split device semantics, then we
can create a local GC list in IPv6 so that it can search based
on rt6i_idev as well as the other keys.  Alternatively we can
remove the dst->dev == dev check in dst_dev_event and dst_ifdown
and move that test down to the individual ifdown functions.
However, IMHO the split device semantics is inconsistent with
the philosphy that addresses belong to the host and not the
interface.  So it doesn't really make sense in the current
networking stack.
Cheers,
