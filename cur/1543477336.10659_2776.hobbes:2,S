I disagree. All that fastdep does is generate a .depend file 
in *that* directory. If that directory is not recursed through
by the main compile or module compile, that file is never used.

Super fast huh? It takes 90 secs to do the dependancies. That 
about 10% of the total compile on my machine for everything.
Since more than half of the directories it recurses are never
looked at anywhere else, it seems a bit of a waste.

genksyms? where? The output of make dep doesn't mention
the word genksyms, module or anything like that anywhere.
Just for arguments sake, I actually implemented it, and it
cut the dep time down to 38 seconds, with no ill effects.
All the .depend files that needed to exist, exist.
Here's the patch. Ofcourse MY_SUB_DIRS is a bad name, bad
I'm trying to make a point.
