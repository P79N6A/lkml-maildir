OK, it builds and runs on my dual athlon (gcc-2.95.3,e1000,scsi), my
notebook (gcc-3.3.5,tg3,acpi), and on an ultra60 (ultrasparc SMP,gcc-3.3.4,
scsi,sunhme). I also built it on an alpha ev6 with gcc-3.3.5, but I didn't
want to reboot it.
While compiling, I noticed that hosts using gcc-3 gave a few warnings such
as this one, which is easily fixed with the following patch :
  bond_alb.c: In function `bond_alb_xmit':
  bond_alb.c:1278: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated

at first, I though that both the config option and the feature were removed !
fortunately, it's only the option ;-)
