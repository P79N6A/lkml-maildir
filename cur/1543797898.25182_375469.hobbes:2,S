From: Mike Miller <mikem@beardog.cca.cpqcorp.net>
This patch fixes a bug that breaks hpacucli, a command line interface
for the HP Array Config Utility. Without this fix the utility will
not detect any controllers in the system. I thought I had already fixed
this, but I guess not.
Thanks to all who reported the issue. Please consider this this inclusion.
