I'm thankful they're not.  It is very difficult to debug threaded programs.
Threads are not a panacea.  It is often a kitchen-sink mentality for 
programming
(we have a feature, let's use it).  Most threaded programs can effectively
be non-threaded if you think hard about the problem.  And then they become
much simpler to debug and understand.
Most programs in the real world are quite poor...threads just make
it harder to debug...
