Larry originally came up with the patch for our RHEL4 2.6.9 kernel,
after customers were hitting OOM under some heavy workload he can
probably recall better than I can.
iirc it didn't solve the users OOM entirely, but it does make their workload
run longer before the kill happens.
A little while later, after Fedora users started reporting oom kills,
I forward-ported it to 2.6.14, and threw it out in an update.
The Fedora user in the bug report
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=175173
who on x86-64 with 5GB saw zone_dma exhausted saw a similar result,
delays the kill, but it does still happen.
Hmm.
