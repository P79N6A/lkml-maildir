That's 2.6.22.6; I was looking at 2.6.23, where clameter had moved
krealloc into mm/util.c.  So that explains why I thought slob didn't
provide it.  Apologies for the confusion.

OK.  I have no problem with making stringbuf allocate max(oldsize * 1.5,
newsize+1).

OK, I'll do that for the next round of patches.

I agree.  It was good for testing though, when I inadvertently wrote to
the wrong bit of the string on a realloc ;-)
