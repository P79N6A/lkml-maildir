Hmm... I'd really prefer to just use the existing i_sem - umsdos doesn't
work as-is right now anyway, but as far as I can see that's really what
umsdos actually wants anyway (ie then you can just remove the down/up from
the UMSDOS_notify_change() routine).
do_truncate() already does the i_sem thing for its notify_change, and
notify_change() really _is_ equivalent to a write, so this really seems to 
make more sense that way. 
Just move the current down/up pair from do_truncate() into notify_change()
(it also protects the "newattrs" assignment in do_truncate, but that is
purely local data at that point and needs no protection).
