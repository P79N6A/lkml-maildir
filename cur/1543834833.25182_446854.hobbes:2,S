No, please read again:
In the kernels referenced in the bug reports, the quirks were not being 
applied.
When the systems booted up a usual APIC/ACPI config, the hardware in 
question did not work. The quirk was not applied here.
When the system booted up a kernel with acpi=off, the hardware in 
question worked fine. The quirk was not applied here.
When the kernel is modified to apply the quirk again, the system works 
fine in both cases.
IOW, on these systems at least, the quirk is *definitely* needed when 
ACPI/APIC are enabled, whereas in your last mail, you were suggesting we 
should only do the quirk in non-APIC mode:

Such a change would stop the hardware in question from working when 
ACPI/APIC are enabled on these systems.
