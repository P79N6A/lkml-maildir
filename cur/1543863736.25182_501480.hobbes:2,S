Justin,
According to your kernel_ring_buffer.txt (attached to another email), 
you are using "anticipatory" as your io scheduler:
   289  Jan 24 18:35:25 p34 kernel: [    0.142130] io scheduler noop 
registered
   290  Jan 24 18:35:25 p34 kernel: [    0.142194] io scheduler 
anticipatory registered (default)
I had a problem with this scheduler where my system would occasionally 
lockup during heavy I/O.  Sometimes it would fix itself, sometimes I had 
to reboot.  I changed to the "CFQ" io scheduler and my system has worked 
fine since then.
CFQ has to be built into the kernel (under BlockLayer/IOSchedulers).  It 
can be selected as default or you can set it during runtime:
echo cfq > /sys/block/<disk>/queue/scheduler
...
Hope this helps,
Bill
