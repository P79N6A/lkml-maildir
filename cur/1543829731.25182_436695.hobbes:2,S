I'm not sure this directly applies, but....
The Marvell wireless chip we're using this generation in the OLPC
machine is interfaced via USB.  Not ideal, but there's no other game in
town to let us keep the mesh network up while the main machine is STR.
We intend to leave the Marvell chip on (it can forward packets in the
mesh network, and/or wake up the CPU if there are inbound packets for
the machine that matter), and turn off the USB interface it is attached
to.
