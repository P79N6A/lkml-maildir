yes, we will not merge these patches without your ack.

I have followed up with a question on this on another thread, so I'll
skip to #2...

I think this should be done - if the pci slot driver detects that a
hotplug driver is controlling a slot, it should allow that driver to
set the name of the slot.

I'm not sure if we can do this, since slot name might depend on what
spec people are implementing.

I think we should definitely implement this one ^^^.
