cond_resched() is conditional on __resched_legal(0), which should take
care of being called under a spinlock.
so I guess we can just reinstate the call in invalidate_mapping_pages()
(still waiting on the compile to finish...)

invalidate_mapping_pages() is called under locks (usually preemptable)
but can do a _lot_ of work, stick in a voluntary preemption point to
avoid excessive latencies (over 10 seconds was reported by softlockup).
