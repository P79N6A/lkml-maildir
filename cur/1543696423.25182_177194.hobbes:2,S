sure. But distributor already has shipped all the modules as part of kernel 
package. Given the number of different kernels in Mandrake currently shipping 
yet another copy of binary modules for kernel sources would easily fill up 
the whole CD alone.
besides it is not the only problem. Even without MODVERSIONS build process 
attempts to write in temporary directory in kernel build tree making it 
impossible for non-root to build module.

Could you point to posts that describe this idea? Also we could join efforts 
:)
