"bk -r check -acv" on the linux-2.5 tree shows up as 39MB RSS in top and is
actually much bigger, it wants all of the SCCS files in ram to go fast. 
If they are, it's about 15 seconds on a Ghz box, if they aren't, it's 
mucho longer.  I _think_ we're careful to not go back and look at the
same files twice but I might be smoking crack.   All I know is that 
running a check on a 128MB machine is painful as hell.
