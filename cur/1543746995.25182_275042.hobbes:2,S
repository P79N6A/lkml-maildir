No. The whole rcu_data structure is cpu-local, it's never accessed from 
remote cpus [except during hotunplug]. It doesn't even contain a lock.
A grace period consists of the following steps:
- one cpu is in rcu_start_batch() and does rcp->cur++.
- for all cpus:
* __rcu_pending mismatch between rdp->quiescbatch and rcp->cur, calls to 
rcu_check_callbacks
* rcu_check_callbacks schedules rcu_process_callbacks as a tasklet
* rcu_process_callbacks stores last_qsctr.
* further calls to rcu_process_callbacks du to __rcu_pendig()==1, until 
qsctr was increased
* grace period completed by the cpu
- for the last cpu: call rcu_start_batch() and start the next one, if 
needed.
As far as I can see the patch is correct.
