That is the design the Jens' original ioprio code used which we used in 
-ck for quite a while. What myself and -ck users found, though, was that 
being tied to cpu 'nice' meant that most tasks behaved pretty much as 
we'd expect based on one sys call.
I think what is ideal is to have both. First the ioprio should be set to 
what the cpu 'nice' level is as a sort of global "this is the priority 
of this task" setting. Then it should also support changing of this 
priority with a different call separate from the cpu nice. That way we 
can take into account access privileges of the caller making it 
impossible to set a high ioprio if the task itself is heavily niced by a 
superuser and so on.
