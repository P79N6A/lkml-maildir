Exactly.  Don't be shy about fiddling CFLAGS in UML-specific Makefiles.  This 
is already done quite a bit (-D__i386__ and the construction of userspace 
CFLAGS are examples).
This is very UML-specific, so there's no reason to bother the rest of the 
kernel (unless, of course, you find a bug that could affect other ports).
