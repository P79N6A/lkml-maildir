Is it possible to use __raw_*() in portable code?  I have some places
in my code where non-byte-swap IO functions would be useful, but on
ppc64, __raw_*() doesn't know about EEH.  Clearly I don't want to
teach portable code about IO_TOKEN_TO_ADDR etc. so it seems I'm out of
luck.  I end up doing the fairly insane:
	writel(swab32(val), addr);
instead of what I really mean, which is:
	__raw_writel(cpu_to_be32(val), addr);
I'm also a little worried that m68k, sh64 and s390 at least don't
define __raw_* functions.
Thanks,
  Roland
