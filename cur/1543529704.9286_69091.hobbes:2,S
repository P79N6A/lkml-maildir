Hi All!
I'm building a new server, and thinking of an Asus P3C-D (i820) or
an Intel "OUTRIGGER" OR840 (i840) motherboard with RDRAM.
Do You guys know about anything i should be aware of?
Are these chipsets ready to use in a production system with the latest
stable kernels?
Thanx for the infos!
PS. If i'm asking it at the wrong place, please tell me where to ask..:>
