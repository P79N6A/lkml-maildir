Linus, would you _look_ at the uses of open() proposed upthread?
Would you like to argue that close(open("/bin/ls,-l,/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY));
as equivalent of spawn(3) is _not_ contrieved and idiotic?
Would you like to argue that close(open("/dev/md0/..add-...=/foo/bar",O_RDONLY))
as a way to add stripes is not contrieved and idiotic?

I would say that both examples above (both really proposed) _are_ side
effects by any definition.

Who argues for ioctls? I'm perfectly OK with the stuff that affects future
IO on the descriptor you've opened. That's what open() is for, after all.
However, IMNSHO examples of abusing open() (see above, grep your mailbox if
you think that I'm making it up) posted to that thread _are_ side effects
- ugly as hell, contrieved and bound to be source of exploits.
