There is nothing really in this object but the "next_id" which is recoverable
by an fsck utility (Not yet submitted) by a simple osd-list-partition
command. Same for num-of-files. All these values are just cached values,
for convenience.

Not used will be dropped

OK Only one, but so is all other directories. I'll think about it.
I'll probably postpone it for together with the raid management.

I fixed all that to be __le64, you can see that on the web here:
http://git.open-osd.org/gitweb.cgi?p=open-osd.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/exofs
I will submit another round ASAP. I'm currently busy with user-mode-library.
Once done I'll post the next exofs round. All these and lots of other areas where
converted to proper __leXX types. Specially the directory code had all these
missing. It was all triggered thanks to Morton who pointed me to all these ext2
bug-fixes since 2.6.10.

Yes also fixed to __le64

OK Avisi got lazy, This is a copy form ext2. I will fix that,
thanks for pointing this out. I will put __le64 for seconds
and also add __le64 for nanoseconds while at it.
Thanks Ingo for your review
