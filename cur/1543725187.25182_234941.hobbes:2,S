John might remember the details, I didn't get a backtrace this time.  When we 
boot with the default values on a 512p system, it livelocks shortly after 
init starts.  I *think* what's happening is that a the global rebalance value 
is shorter than the time it takes to do the global rebalance, due to 
cacheline contention.
