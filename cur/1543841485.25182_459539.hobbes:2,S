I edit .config but still have to use 'make oldconfig' afterwards. And it
screws me over because of all this 'select' nonsense. This used to
work...
	sed -i /^CONFIG_SCSI=/d .config 
	yes n | make oldconfig
So "make *config" certainly isn't optimised for me, although of course I
do have to use it. It seems to be increasingly optimised for Aunt
Tillie.
