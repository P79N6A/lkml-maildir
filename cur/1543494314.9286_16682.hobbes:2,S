Hi,
    I'm looking at the source for end_that_request_first in ll_rw_blk.c:
int 
end_that_request_first( struct request *req, int uptodate, char *name ) 
{
	struct buffer_head * bh;
	int nsect;
	req->errors = 0;
	if (!uptodate) {
		printk("end_request: I/O error, dev %s (%s), sector %lu\n",
			kdevname(req->rq_dev), name, req->sector);
		if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
			nsect = bh->b_size >> 9;
			req->nr_sectors--;
			req->nr_sectors &= ~(nsect - 1);
			req->sector += nsect;
			req->sector &= ~(nsect - 1);
		}
	}
	if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
		req->bh = bh->b_reqnext;
		bh->b_reqnext = NULL;
		bh->b_end_io(bh, uptodate);
		if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
			req->current_nr_sectors = bh->b_size >> 9;
			if (req->nr_sectors < req->current_nr_sectors) {
				req->nr_sectors = req->current_nr_sectors;
				printk("end_request: buffer-list destroyed\n");
			}
			req->buffer = bh->b_data;
			return 1;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
and I'm thinking "why doesn't the sector field in the request get updated when
there are more buffer heads on the list?". Doesn't this mean that a driver
which processes the buffer heads on the list one at a time will start trying to
read/write subsequent buffer heads from/to the wrong sector?
If you could explain this little mystery to me I should be most grateful.
Please cc on any reply, thanks, Harry.
