Hi !
Good catch, Ion !

Same here, dual AMD/760MPX.
BTW, there's something I don't understand. The only reference to
APIC_init_uniprocessor() I found was in smpboot.c:1044. It's called when the
SMP config has not been found at boot time (and it also sets
phys_cpu_present_map to 1, BTW). My problem is that this function is executed
on my dual-k7, on an SMP kernel (because I see the added message), but I
don't see the "SMP motherboard not detected" message which should be displayed
just before APIC_init_uniprocessor().
So I suspect there's something strange in this code that might explain why
only CPU0 receives the interrupts, but I don't understand the code path !
I'd appreciate it if someone has a clue... I can provide .config and dmesg
if needed. By this time, I'll add printk's everywhere in the kernel.
Cheers,
Willy
