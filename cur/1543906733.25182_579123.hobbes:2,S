Please, do that as SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE, and make it look like
	config SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE
		depends on BLACKFIN || MIPS || SUPERH || FRV || ((PPC32 && PPC_MPC52xx)
		depends on !SMP
		default y
and now you can write the above thing as
	depends on SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE || SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE
and it's all much nicer.
I would say that doing a similar setup for HIBERNATE would be nice too, 
but the SUSPEND case is more noticeable because the SMP case is so nice 
already.
