This discussion was about event driven vs. thread driven IO models, and
threadlet only behaves like event driven because in my tests there was
exactly one threadlet rescheduling per severa thousands of clients.
Kevent is just a logical interpolation of performance of event driven
model.
My assumptions were based not on kevent performance, but on the fact,
that event delivery is much faster and simpler than thread handling.
Ugh, I'm starting that stupid talk again - let's just jump to the end -
I agree that in real-life high-performance systems both models must be
used.
Peace? :)

After your changes epoll increased to 5k.
I can easily reproduce 6300/4300 split, but can not get more than 7k for
kevent (with oprofile/idle=poll at least).
I've completed 800k run:
kevent 4800
epoll 4450
with tons ofoverflows in 'ab':

Any other bench?
