Maybe this is a better way to get my point across.  Think about more CPUs
on the same memory subsystem.  I've been trying to make this scaling point
ever since I discovered how much cache misses hurt.  That was about 1995
or so.  At that point, memory latency was about 200 ns and processor speeds
were at about 200Mhz or 5 ns.  Today, memory latency is about 130 ns and
processor speeds are about .3 ns.  Processor speeds are 15 times faster and
memory is less than 2 times faster.  SMP makes that ratio worse.
It's called asymptotic behavior.  After a while you can look at the graph
and see that more CPUs on the same memory doesn't make sense.  It hasn't
made sense for a decade, what makes anyone think that is changing?
