   Good point.  What about this patch then?
No, this is gross.  The ipsec protocols should be available by
default, I don't like this message solution at all.
Why don't we do this for every thing that needs ZLIB for example?
The answer is that we don't because it's rediculious.  We instead
define sensible defaults and if the user grinds out his own changes
that override them, as James said, he does so at his own peril.
