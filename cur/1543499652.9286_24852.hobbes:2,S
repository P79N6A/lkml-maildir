How do you know this information is correct?  What if a driver goes
gonzo and requests 20 regions before it finds one it likes.  This kind
of info is best suited to some kind of log or history.
BTW, if there is a way to arbitrate sharing of regions that would be
great.  An optional usage count maybe?
