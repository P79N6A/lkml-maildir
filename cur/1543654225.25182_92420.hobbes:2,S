It now doesn't.  What I'm considering is some function you can call from
gdb which would longjmp to the stack that you want to look at and execute
a breakpoint (or maybe just hit a breakpoint that was put there earlier).
That should give you equivalent functionality to the current det/att.

Pretty much.  It's basically the same as SMP in tt mode, except that starting
the idle threads will be slightly different.
