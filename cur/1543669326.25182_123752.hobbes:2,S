Well, one question is this: I'd like to be able to get at a list of disk stats
sorted by activity.  If you noticed, the output above reserved space for 4
drives.  I know it's not general at all, but it would be nice to somehow be
able to get at the "busy" drives.  I don't have any ideas on how to do this
generally and that might mean it isn't possible but maybe (I hope) it means
I'm tired and not thinking clearly.  Anyone have any ideas?
