Even if in mentined samples kernel used more CPU more extensively then
all userspace processes combined still there were LOTS of CPU power free
to use. Real bottleneck is I/O :-/ And Linux is not good in this area
(especially with bad hardware like EIDE). 2.2 is better then 2.0, 2.3 is
better then 2.2 but steel cursor is not moving smoothly mcedit on
console (no X!) when there are paraller kernel and xfree86 compilation in
background ...
