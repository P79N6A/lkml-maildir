While accessing a ide-floppy disk (LS120), I got the following error
messages:
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  3, asc = 11, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:41 (hdd), sector 176058
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  3, asc = 11, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:41 (hdd), sector 176054
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  3, asc = 11, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:41 (hdd), sector 176056
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  3, asc = 11, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:41 (hdd), sector 176058
I don't seem to be able to access certain files any more. So my questions 
are: 
- What can trigger these messages ?
- What is exactly wrong with the disk (or drive, or whatsoever) ?
- Is there any way to retain those inaccessible files ?
The kernel is 2.2.3 with ide-floppy compiled as module.
