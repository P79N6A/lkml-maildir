I basically agree with your argumentation, but it wasn't really eliminated 
in 2.5.6. The kernel still provides some values to the users. If the 
kernel doesn't know, it should clearly say so, this is where we fucked up. 
Silently fixing a few applications and leaving everybody else believing 
everything is well doesn't help.
At this point we either complete the job and remove this ioctl or we 
restore the 2.4 behaviour (maybe with a deprecated warning).
bye, Roman
