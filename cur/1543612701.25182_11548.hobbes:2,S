Hi,
When booting a virgin 2.5.1-pre7 kernel I get this panic:
VFS: Cannot open root device "341" or 03:41
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:41
2.5.1-pre6 boots fine with the same .config and /etc/lilo.conf
When I add root=/dev/hdb1 to the kernel commandline I get the same error
hdb isn't detected by my BIOS but by the kernel. I have a boot partition (hda1)
Attached you find my .config and lilo.conf
