I think this should default to 0x00000000, then in the early_printk code
we can test for zero baseaddress and attempt some sensible fallback in
that case (even to disable).

Again, default address should be zero which is checked in the code (zero
can disable).  Prevent accesses to random memory locations in case of
poorly configured kernel.

As suggested by Grant, this sohuld be
1. renamed and described as something sensible
SELF_MODIFYING_CODE_HACK
2. Made condition on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL at very least.

Should be just "get all of the CPU settings", since we use OF to get the
device tree.

Why does this depend on UNCACHED_SHADOW?
