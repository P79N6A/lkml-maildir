   what's somewhat weird is that the disk _seemed_ OK (i.e. no errors 
that I would notice, nothing in the syslog) and then suddenly the disk 
does not respond at all, I tried dd_rescue and it ran for hours (more 
than a day) and it rescued absolutely nothing. Is it possible that the 
disk surface is OK but the electronics went bad? Is there anything that 
can be done if that's the case? (I have another disk, same model).
