My personal preference is:
1) change s390* entry*.S so that all syscalls can use up to 6 arguments,
   otherwise we'll have the same problem every now and then
   (last syscall before this one was fadvise64_64 if I remember well)
2) allow sys_futex to have 6 arguments (the 6th on the stack, get_user'ed
   from an s390 wrapper)
3) special structure passed in 5th argument for FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE
4) your solution
   (you have a special wrapper around futex anyway, so why not to handle
   it there already and create completely new syscall).
That said, NPTL can deal with any of these variants and the decision
is up to Martin I think (assuming the base patch gets accepted, that is).
http://listman.redhat.com/archives/phil-list/2004-May/msg00031.html
is the latest version of the userland part of FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE changes
(against CVS glibc) and there futex_requeue () macro is defined
in arch specific headers, so nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/s390/lowlevellock.h
can do there its own black magic.
