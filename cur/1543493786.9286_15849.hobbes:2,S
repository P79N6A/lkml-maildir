Subject: switching channels with WinTV primio doesn't work

Thias problem occurs with all tv programs I've tested. When I
start xawtv (or any other tv viewer) I get the last selected
channel. When I try to switch to another channel nothing happens.
the current channel stays. But in the status bar xawtv shows me
which channel should be seen. I'm using the 2.2.6 kernel. When I
load the bttv module I get the following output in my syslog:
Apr 25 03:45:53 nexus kernel: bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.
Apr 25 03:45:53 nexus kernel: bttv0: Hauppauge eeprom: tuner=Philips FI1216 MK2 (5)
Apr 25 03:45:53 nexus kernel: bttv0: model: BT848(Hauppauge old)
Is this a problem with the old BT848 chip set?
Regards
Martin
