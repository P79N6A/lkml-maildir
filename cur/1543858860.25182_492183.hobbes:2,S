Can you try "git bisect" on this?
It's really easy: since you know that v2.6.20-rc1 doesn't work, and 
v2.6.19-rc6 _does_ work, just get the current kernel git tree, and then do
	git bisect start
	git bisect good v2.6.19-rc6
	git bisect bad v2.6.20-rc1
and it will pick a kernel for you to try. Just compile that, boot with it, 
and if it works, say "git bisect good" (and if it doesn't work, just do 
"git bisect bad" instead). It will give you a new kernel, and in a few 
tries you'll have been able to narrow down exactly where it breaks (ok, 
more than "a few" - there's 3728 commits in that range, so it's more like 
"twelve reboots later").
That said, it's likely one of not a lot of commits that are broken, as 
shown by
	git log v2.6.19-rc6..v2.6.20-rc1 arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c
and it's *probably* commit b0268726: "[PATCH] x86-64: Try multiple timer 
variants in check_timer"
But a few other people also added to the Cc in case they have ideas.
