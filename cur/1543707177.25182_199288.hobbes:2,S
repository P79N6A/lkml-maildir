Since Nischal didn't specify which port on the sound card he was thinking about, 
I started to think that a SPDIF digital output / input, would give much better 
results:
6 channels, 16 bit, 48KHz = 4.6Mbit/s
I don't know enough about the standard digital format and the maximum bandwidth 
that we could get from a sound card, but in theory we probably could connect the 
digital input on a sound card to digital output on another card (and vice-versa) 
and map the whole thing as a network interface :)
Anyway, this is an extremely crazy, time wasting, "just do it if you have loads 
of time to throw out the window" kind of project, because the cost of ethernet 
NIC's is extremely low these days.
