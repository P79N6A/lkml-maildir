The destructor is never invoked from that path, but it's not the path that
should free it anyway. To me it appears the call to __page_cache_release()
on the head of the hugepage should just be removed in favor of doing
nothing; at best it can only race against concurrent put_page(), see
page_count(page) vanish, and accidentally call free_hot_page() against
the head of the hugepage. As hugepages are never on the LRU, the
remainder of __page_cache_release() should be a nop for them.
Untested patch below.
