Subject: HIGHMEM4G config for 1GB RAM on desktop?

There seems to be a controversy about the use of the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G  
kernel configuration.  After reading many posts on the subject, I still 
don't know which setting is best for me.
My x86 system has 1.0GB of installed memory and is primarily used as a 
desktop environment.  I don't have any SCSI devices that might require a 
high-memory buffer.  Should I enable the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G config for this 
environment or not?
Thanks.
