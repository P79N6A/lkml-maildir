Which is how many?  Do you have _any_ data which shows that this is going
to do anything?  Everything I know says that you're in the 1% area.  My
experience is perhaps different than yours, but I'd like to know why.

Great, so set it up, write a parser that grabs all the patches out of the
list, run them through your system, and report back how much it helps.

more power to you.
