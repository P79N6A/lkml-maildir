It is becoming increasingly apparent, that mount/umount permission
based on file permissions is inherently broken:
1) there are user-writable files under /proc/$PID/, which definitely
   shouldn't be allowed to be overmounted
2) if user mounts an fs read-only, then wants to create a submount of
   this, it will fail with the current patchset
Solving 2) should be trivial: submounting a mount owned by the user
should be always allowed regardless of the file permissions.
Maybe this could be generaized to say, that a mount can be submounted
by an unprivileged user IFF parent mount is owned by said user.
This would get rid of some of the complications in the current
patchset, namely the functionality of MNT_ALLOWUSERMNT and MNT_USER
flags would be merged, and the permission checking would be removed.
For example on login, the user could get a private namespace set up
some that the home directory is owned by the user, and hence can be
freely submounted:
  clone(CLONE_NEWNS)
  mount --bind /home/$USER /home/$USER
  mount --remount -ouser=$USER /home/$USER
This is of course more limiting than allowing mounts based on file
permissions, but it's also a lot cleaner.
Hmm?
