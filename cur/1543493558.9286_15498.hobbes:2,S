ksymoops does not read vmlinux by default.  I was also thinking about
users who want to do cross system debugging.  That is, those working on
embedded systems or porting to new systems.  Debugging a big endianess
Oops (say i370) on a little endian machine (say i386) needs a common
interface.  Fortunately we have one, it's called network order :).
The real problem is the endianess ambiguity on *some* systems when they
dump their code lines.  AFAIK, all archs use network order for
/proc/ksyms, System.map, EIP/PC, registers, stack trace, objdump etc.
Some archs dump Code: in network order as well.  Only a few systems
cause problems by dump the Code: line with the native endianess.  IMHO,
the traps.c code for those systems should be converted to network order
instead of complicating ksymoops even further.
