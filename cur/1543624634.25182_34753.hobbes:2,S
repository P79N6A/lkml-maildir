Subject: USB-Storage in 2.4.19-pre

I have used usb-storage with stock redhat kernels for some times. That is usable
with just few problems. Recently I switched to 2.4.17, and then to 2.4.19-pre1.
On the stock redhat kernels (up to the latest update 2.4.9-31) and on 2.4.17  I had to
umount the disk before shutdown. Normal shutdown did not unmount the disk cleanly.
It looks like the scsi layer lost access to the physical disk - maybe after unmouting
of usbdevfs. (even when I unmount the disk I had some scsi errors reported).
This problem was fixed with 2.4.19-pre1.
Now I'm trying the latest changes. 2.4.19-pre2-ac{3.4} and 2.4.19-pre3 and I cannot
use usb-storage at all. I get all kind of erros similar to these:
Mar 14 13:41:06 itai kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2, assigned device number 2
Mar 14 13:41:06 itai kernel: usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 2, frame# 673

Mar 14 13:41:09 itai kernel: usb.c: USB device not responding, giving up (error=-84)
Switching back to 2.4.19-pre1 - It looks like the disk is reported too early. The Vendor-Model-Rev
fields are still empty. (Is it just cosmetics or a real problem?)
