Distribution makers shouldn't be overly impressed by this default,
and just put "lba32" into any new lilo.conf they generate, or at
least offer the option to do so.
Keeping the old CHS default makes sure that people upgrading LILO
on an already configured (and probably quite ancient) system that
really needs CHS don't get a nasty surprise.
