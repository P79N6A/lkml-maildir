No. 
But it isn't really a issue. Basically everything[1] will work fine anyways.
[1]  Only thing you're missing AFAIK is PCI Extended Error Reporting.

If you have a better proposal please share. I tried a few others, but none
of them could handle all the buggy Intel 9x5 boards that hang on any
mmconfig access (so the "try the first few busses" check already hangs)
Originally I thought
DMI blacklisting would work, but it's on too many systems for that
(and Linus rightfully hated it anyways). ACPI checks also didn't work.
I don't know of any others.
