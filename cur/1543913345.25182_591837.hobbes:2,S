FWIW, I was running 2.6.23-rc5 on my laptop (along with iwlwifi-0.1.14
for wireless) and I saw the same symptom: panic (blinking capslock)
while in X.  I saw one panic out of maybe 12 hours of uptime over a
few reboots.  The same system is quite stable with the stock Ubuntu
2.6.22 kernel.
My laptop is a Thinkpad X60s (core duo) so quite a different system.
I'm traveling at the moment so I probably won't be able to gather much
debugging info until next week.
