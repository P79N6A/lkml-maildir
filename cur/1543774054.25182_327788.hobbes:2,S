please retest using recent (i.e. today's) -RT kernels. There were a
whole bunch of fixes that could affect these numbers. (But i'm sure you
know very well that you cannot expect a fully-preemptible kernel to have
zero runtime cost. In that sense, if you want to be fair, you should
compare it to the SMP kernel, as total preemptability is a similar
technological feat and has very similar parallelism constraints.)
