hm, i thought Jes having the first S-o-b line makes it well-defined that 
he is the author? I did that similarly for the other patches too: the 
primary author has the first S-o-b line, and that's definitely not 
always me in this series: Nico and Arjan have written portions too. (i 
have added my S-o-b lines because i obviously refactored the patches and 
did some changes to them too most of the time, but only as secondary 
lines)
I only add "From:" if i dont have a S-o-b line from someone. Am i 
applying the S-o-b protocol incorrectly?
