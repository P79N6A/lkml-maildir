	Perhaps you missed it, but I believe Dave's intent is for this to
only be a proof-of-concept idea at this time.  These changes are not 
currently up for inclusion into the mainstream kernel.  I can not think
that Dave would ever just step around a maintainer and submit a patch to
Linus for large changes.
	If many people test these and things work out well for them 
then I'm sure Dave will go back to the maintainers with the code and 
the api and work with them to get it into the mainstream kernel.  
Soliciting ideas and suggestions on how to improve the api and the code 
paths in the drivers to handle this new method most effectively.
