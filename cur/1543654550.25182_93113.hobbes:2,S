Subject: Reiserfs broken in 2.5.50 (possibly nanosecond stat timefields?)

Upon compiling and booting 2.5.50, there seemed to be a flurry of
messages regarding /etc/mtab and /etc/mtab~77 or ~32 or some other
random numbers. ls in /etc seems to look good, but upon opening mtab
up in vi, I get a kernel BUG, and everything stops responding. I flip
VT's and type my username, but never get a password prompt. I rebooted
again, and cat'ed dmesg to a file just for safety. That works, until I
open it up, where I get the BUG again. Reboot to 2.5.47, everything
seems to work ok. Open up the dmesg file I saved, no bug, but the file
seems to be garbage. hexdump looks like
0000000: 6c64 2e73 6f2d 312e 372e 3000 2c03 0000  ld.so-1.7.0.,...

ld.so? My systems is completely reiserfs (3.6), and nothing has
changed in my config file between 2.5.47 and 2.5.50. Upon looking
through the source tree, it seems like lines 1134-7 in
fs/reiserfs/namei.c seem to be throwing this panic. Only changesets to
touch namei.c in the past 4 months are "nanosecond stat timefields" and
"*_mknod prototype". I really can't see why these would cause this
problem, so maybe someone else does. Hand-copied output from the
BUG() follows, so this is only what I thought was important and might
contain errors. If you need any other information I will gladly supply
it.
