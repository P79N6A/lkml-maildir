It optionally (if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_SOUND) registers
as sound mixer, so you can adjust the volume of the TV card with a
mixer tool of your choice.  That's the only thing it has common with
sound card drivers.

I'd move the config option to the v4l-Config.in.  The chip is useful
for TV-Sound, you'll never find this chip on a "normal" sound card.
It does'nt belong into the sound card section IMO, and this will
confuse alot of users.
