In one sense or another some sort of graceful transition to unfair
behavior could be considered a kind of thrashing control; how meaningful
that is in the context of disk I/O is a question I can't answer directly,
though. Do you have any comments on this potential strategic unfairness?

What kinds of phenomena appear to be associated with IDE's latencies?
I recall some comments from prior IDE maintainers on poor interactions
between generic disk I/O layers and IDE drivers, particularly with
respect to small transactions being given to the drivers to perform.
Are these comments still relevant, or is this of a different nature?
Cheers,
Bill
