The STANDALONE thing? I'm not convinced that's really any cleaner,
it makes even more of a mess of io.h than there was already (though
we could consider that a lost cause ;-)). 
What's your objection to just throwing in a defn of xquad_portio?
A preference for burying the messy stuff in header files? Seems to
me that as you have to define STANDALONE now, the point is moot.
