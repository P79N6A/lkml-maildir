Hmm.  This will work as long as the peer process is running setuid
to it's own unique user.  Excellent idea!  Since I need to make the
program setuid to avoid non-priveleged ptrace attacks, this is a
terrific solution.

I'm actually not so concerned about the client -- that code will be
trusted as well.  The problem I'm trying to solve is preventing any
non-priveleged code except the server and client from gaining access
to their shared memory area.  With the feedback I've received from
this thread I think a solid design is emerging, some of which will
need to be solved by system configuration by the sysadmin.
Thanks,
Brent
