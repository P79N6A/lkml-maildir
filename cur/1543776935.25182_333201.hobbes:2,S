35 years for me...  My, how the time flies!

Don't rule out the hardware too quickly.  2.4 and 2.6 manage the UHCI
controllers in different ways.  In particular, the usb-uhci driver in 2.4
does not suspend the controller when no devices are attached, whereas
uhci-hcd in 2.6 does.  (So does the "alternate" uhci driver in 2.4.)  I
recently handled a bug report -- from another Frenchman -- where it turned
out that his UHCI hardware instantly crashed the entire system whenever
it resumed from the suspended state!
To try and help pin things down, tomorrow (i.e., Tuesday) I'll send you a
test patch to completely disable the UHCI controllers, leaving them awake
and idle, not generating interrupts.  If you still get those spurious
IRQs, they will have to come from somewhere else.  (Assuming you can
devote server time to this sort of testing...)
And of course, if the spurious IRQs stop then we'll know where to probe 
further.
