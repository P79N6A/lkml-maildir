Still no good. xine drops frames by kernel's make -j2, xmms skips while
bk pull (locally). Updates (after switching desktops in metacity) get
delayed for seconds (mozilla window redraws with www.kernel.org on it,
for example).
Priorities of xine threads were around 15-16, with one of them
constantly at 16 (the one with most cpu). gcc/as processes were 20-21.
That said, it feels better than before, though. And the last changes in
the scheduler seem to reveal more races in applications (a found rxvt
not checking for errors reading from pty).
