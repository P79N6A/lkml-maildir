I think I have.  Seems that someone hasn't been naming their patches
consistently (which is quite irksome).  I have:
fix-the-softlockup-watchdog-to-actually-work.patch
softlockup-make-asm-irq_regsh-available-on-every-platform.patch
softlockup-improve-debug-output.patch
softlockup-watchdog-style-cleanups.patch
softlockup-add-a-proc-tuning-parameter.patch
softlockup-add-a-proc-tuning-parameter-fix.patch

It fails with them all applied too:
fix-leak-on-proc-lockdep_stats.patch				OK
fix-the-softlockup-watchdog-to-actually-work.patch		BAD
softlockup-make-asm-irq_regsh-available-on-every-platform.patch
softlockup-improve-debug-output.patch				BAD
softlockup-watchdog-style-cleanups.patch
softlockup-add-a-proc-tuning-parameter.patch
softlockup-add-a-proc-tuning-parameter-fix.patch		BAD
