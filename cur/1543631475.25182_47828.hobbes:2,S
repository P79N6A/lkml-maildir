I see how the patch is supposed to work, such subtle dependency on doing
the check_pgt_cache after the tlb invalidate wasn't commented in the
patch, it deserves a fat comment or it's really hard to guess we depend
on it. the main reason being that pte_free semantics are really "free
like if I put back in the freelist", not "don't touch it until
check_pgt_cache", because remember the pte_free clobbers the contents of
the pte with "random" data, this random data happens to have the
property on x86 that all the last 2 bits are always zero, so the last
two bits aren't random, and with this conicidence plus the other
coincidence that the invalid bit of the pte is the less significant bit
in the pte entry, it can actually work on x86, but it can very well not
work on other archs if the invalid bit isn't the last one or if they
stores something else and not a virtual addess in the pte entry chain.
In short the "pte_free" must clobber the pte in a way that lefts it
invalid, so that we're guaranteed to generate a page fault, this
requirement also deserves a big fat comment. I couldn't guess the
dependency of the fix on the lowlevel details of the quicklist
releasing, on the invalid bits of the pte and finally on the bits
guaranteed to be zero, not sure if that was just obvious to all the arch
maintainers.

the question is: can you explain how the speculative tlb fill can start?

	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I assume the userspace access could be imagined right after the
invalidate_tlb in the above example, and that's the one supposed to
trigger the speculative tlb fill but how can it pass the invalidate_tlb?

In all cases either the 2.4 fix is wrong, or 2.5 is still overkill while
freeing the pages (not the pagetables), while freeing the pages the
fastmode can still be mm_users == 1 (there's no risk of caching a global
tlb entry with the pages, they're just data, not metadata, and the data
will be invalidated from the cpu during the tlb flush).
I also assume that an irq will force a restart of the TLB fill, if it
doesn't then the same race in freeing the pagetables can happen with
only one cpu too (again assuming invalidate_tlb isn't enough that I
don't think it's the case).

If that's true then the previous race (the number 2, where I wrote "see
below") cannot happen and we can return to do the fastmode mm_users == 1
check also for the pte/pmd freeing (not only for the page freeing). They
are confirming the TLB fill is serialized by the overwrite of mov->cr3
and the invalidate_tlb _before_ the cpu-local userspace access
underlined in the previous case2 will be a strong barrier for any tlb
fill, so the tlb fill cannot be speculated across it and we can fastmode
with mm_users == 1.
> cross-call itself necessarily does anything to the background TLB fetch.
If smp_num_cpus == 1 or #ifndef CONFIG_SMP can use the fastmode for bug
number 2, then it means the irq handler is a cpu-local strong barrier as
strong as the invalidate_tlb (otherwise in case 2 again the race could
trigger on an UP machine if the irq handler aloocates the page [skb or
whatever] and scribbles over it). OTOH as said case 2 cannot trigger
anyways even on SMP because there's the invalidate_tlb that forbids the
speculative tlb fill to pass, so if the irq is a barrier for the tlb
fill or not is not obvious from case2.
But regardless of case2, I think for UP single threaded transparency all
the IRQs should be strong barriers to any speculative activity, so I
think the IPI irq should as well be a strong barrier that forbids the
speculative TLB to pass. So I'm not convinced the above is necessary.
The only required thing for this last case3 is that the order is
pte_clear, invalidate_tlb and finally free_page and that's guaranteed by
the fastmode because mm_users > 1 (there's an active lazy mm of the same
mm in cpu2), and the invalidate_tlb will make sure any tlb fill is
restarted before the page can be freed and in turn before the pte can be
scribbled by cpu 1 (or any other cpu in the system). otherwise it means
the irq isn't a barrier for the speculative tlb fill as it should for
UP transparency of the speculative actions (all speculative actions
should become visible only with smp effects).

thanks for the whole explanation, this just makes many things clear, the
approch in the patch floating around definitely can fix free_pgtables
(case1) [I'd say a bit by luck because the pte still are overwritten in
pte_free], and it incidentally fixes case2 as well (plus it is more
efficient than 2.4 by lefting the fastmode for pages mm_users == 1). But
I'm not really convinced that the tlb fill can pass the IPI irq in case
3 (so I'm not convinced leave_mm is needed), and I think the 2.4 patch
incidentally takes care of case 2 too, but again I don't see what's the
problem of case2 in doing the fastmode for pte too (not only for pages,
where for pages it is certainly safe, or better at worse we can read out
of the ram address spce, potentially allocating an alias cacheline on
the gart but that's ok as far as it's a read-only cacheline, and
speculative read activity shouldn't really allocate writeback buffered
cachelines that would cause lost coherency to two aliased phys addresses)
