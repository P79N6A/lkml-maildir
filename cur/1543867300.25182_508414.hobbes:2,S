well, each async syslet has a separate TID at the moment, so if we want 
a submitted syslet to be cancellable then we could return the TID of the 
syslet handler (instead of the NULL) in sys_async_exec(). Then 
user-space could send a signal the old-fashioned way, via sys_tkill(), 
if it so wishes.
the TID could also be used in a sys_async_wait_on() API. I.e. it would 
be a natural, readily accessible 'cookie' for the pending work. TIDs can 
be looked up lockless via RCU, so it's reasonably fast as well.
( Note that there's already a way to 'signal' pending syslets: do_exit() 
  in the user context will signal all async contexts (which results in 
  -EINTR of currently executing syscalls, wherever possible) and will 
  tear them down. But that's too crude for aio_cancel() i guess. )
