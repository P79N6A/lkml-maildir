Sure.

Yes, a while later.  I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to post your patches here
before submission, but I don't think you need to funnel them through Ted.

Well, I can think of a few mechanisms that would work better than a
simple on/off method that you are proposing.  The current code will
basically "fill" the urandom pool each time it is depleted, and then
when the entropy is gone it will just go on dumping out data.  You
could make urandom only get more entropy each N times through its pool,
or make N a function of the "fullness" of the available entropy.  Then
if a system has lots of entropy sources urandom is TRNG, but if not
it will gracefully degrade from TRNG to PRNG without wiping out all
the entropy in the process.
As an alternative, instead of taking poolsize bytes of entropy each
N uses, you could take some small amount of entropy to mix into the
pool slowly.
Cheers, Andreas
