irq load fluctuates by definition. but acting on it faster isn't the
right thing.

like what?
Assuming this is a "once every few seconds" decision (and really it is,

I assume you've read what/how irqbalance does; good luck convincing
people that that kind of policy belongs in the kernel.

kernel or kernel source? If there was a good place in the kernel source
I'd not be against moving irqbalance there. In the kernel... not needed.
(also because on single socket machines, the irqbalancer basically has
a one-shot task because there balancing is effectively a static setup)
The same ("critical piece of infrastructure') can be said about other
things, like udev and ... even hal. Nobody is arguing for moving those
into the kernel though....

interrupts and tasks have an N:M relationship.... or sometimes 1:M
where tasks only depend on one irq. Moving the irq around then tends to
be a loss. For NUMA, you actually very likely want the IRQ on the node
that the IO is associdated with.

irqbalance does that today.

I listed a few;
1) it's policy 
2) the memory is only needed for a short time (20 seconds or so) on
single-socket machines
3) it makes decisions on "subjective" information such as interrupt
device classes that the kernel currently just doesn't have (it could
grow that obviously), and is clearly policy information.
