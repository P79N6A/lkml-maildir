Please first check to see if /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 
contains the string:
Option "RenderAccel" "1"
If it does, either remove the line or replace it with:
Option "RenderAccel" "0"
Render acceleration is still not working with the proprietary driver. I'm not 
saying it's definitely this, it just might not be related to the messages in 
syslog.
I occasionally see these badness messages in syslog, but my machine never 
locks up. I was under the impression that these were only warnings.
