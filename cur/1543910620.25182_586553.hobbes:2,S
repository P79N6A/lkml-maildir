Although interestingly, we are not guaranteed to have enough memory to
completely initialise writeout of a single page.
The buffer layer doesn't require disk blocks to be allocated at page
dirty-time. Allocating disk blocks can require complex filesystem operations
and readin of buffer cache pages. The buffer_head structures themselves may
not even be present and must be allocated :P
In _practice_, this isn't such a problem because we have dirty limits, and
we're almost guaranteed to have some clean pages to be reclaimed. In this
same way, networked filesystems are not a problem in practice. However
network swap, because there is no dirty limits on swap, can actually see
the deadlock problems.
