If these were each only 100 bytes of memory (unlikely), my answer would
be "what are you smoking?"  I am no kernel hacker (though I am going to
try to cut my teeth here shortly), but no, I really don't think so.  If
I don't want APM debugging functionality, I don't want ifs taking up
kernel time, I don't want code taking up ram... I JUST DON'T WANT IT.
This is not Windows land where you make things "run time configurable." 
You make them clean; you make the cut and dry!  Like I said, if they
were 200 bytes of memory TOTAL and didn't clutter the common path,
fine... but I don't think you can claim this.
