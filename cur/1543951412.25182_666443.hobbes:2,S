Actually, it's clearly not one-to-one.  Counter-example:
a 3V3 regulator powering one of a SOC's I/O power domains,
which is managed by a digital switch.  That same regulator
can power several I/O devices too.  It may even feed a 1V8
regulator.
So the relationship is probably that regulators define a
domain ... but such domains can be subdivided.  There's
a tree; it's probably more shallow than the clock tree.
And enable/disable primitives probably map best to power
domains, not all of which are entire regulators.
