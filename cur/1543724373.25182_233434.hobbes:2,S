I've seen this on a partition with NO other activity, than me editing a .c
file with emacs in a project consisting of about 4 files in total, compiling
and testingocasionally, editing again, etc... Then one day, powerloss, 
when power came back, the file was nothing but null. Atleast it had 
correct size and timestamp though, great comfort, that. :)
