It is my understanding that there is one kernel stack. If there
is a stack allocated for some "transition", and I guess there
may be, because of the mail I'm getting, then it has absolutely
no purpose whatsoever and is wasted valuable non-paged RAM.
The reason why system-call parameters are passed in registers
is so that we didn't have the overhead of copying stuff from a
user stack to a kernel stack.
Does anybody know (not guess) if this was stuff added for the
new non-interrupt 0x80 syscall code? I want to know how a
simple kernel got corrupted into this twisted thing.
Anybody who has a copy of any of the Intel manuals since '386
knows that there needs to be only one kernel stack.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
