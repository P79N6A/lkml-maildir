I kinda wish we'd fix these in the callers.  I know we do something
similar to this with mntput(), but I worry a bit that this just
discourages people from using the right interfaces.
Do you have a case where we're actually getting a NULL mount in here?
We had at least one in reiser4 that really revealed some nastiness in
the fs that needed fixing.
