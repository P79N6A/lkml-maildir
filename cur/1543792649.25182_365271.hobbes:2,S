Since it out of tree, it's not a issue of 'updating' a kernel, it's more
of a issue of making it compile with a kernel.
(which if you read the original post was one of the problems mentioned.)
And, yes, they might have a valid view, but the kernel also has
"experimental" features, why not merge a driver that can be used, mark
it as experimental until it's merged with a stable rel. The issue of
getting the first rel in to the kernel is that all of the sudden more
developers starts hacking away on it and the original developers have to
keep it all in sync (as i mentioned before).

And that applies to me to, now deal with it.
