No, That is NOT OK! That's nothing but a joke, and if it is a joke : )
it hits well in Mister Buesches direction. In so far it's 
well-done : ) : ) : )
To be honest:
I expect at least TWO explained cases:
A. The case in which the b44 module is a PCI module (onboard, additional PCI 
card etc.).
B. At least one well described case in which the b44 module is a bus 
independent one.
Apart from that, it is Michael's task to explain the what and why, not mine 
and not yours! It is him that wants his stuff being pulled into mainline, and 
in so far he very well can do the "dirty work" of documentation, explanation.
But the issue is: He is not ready to DO that! Only if it fires back!
Cheers
Uwe
