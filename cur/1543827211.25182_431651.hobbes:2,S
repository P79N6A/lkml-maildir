It will halt and fail the boot.
Of course, installing a kernel more recent on 2.6.14 or so a RHEL4
system when you have a SCSI controller such as MPT Fusion will also
cause the system to fail to boot unless you remember to compile it
directly into the kernel because of changes in semantics about whether
the SCSI probing happens before or after the module load completes ---
and the answer that has been given is "we don't care".  So these sorts
of traps have been around for people who are going back and forth
between the bleeding edge and distro systems, but I think we'd all
agree that this isn't necessarily the common case.
