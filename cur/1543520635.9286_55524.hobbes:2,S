There's no way you can rely on a fixed MODULE_PARAM info to avoid going
oom in the case where the admin is doing the wrong thing.

With my fix for the dirty-oom bug (different (more serious) issue), you
will know how much protected data is allocated in memory all the time. You
don't need any bitmap to know how much memory is allocated for all ramdisk
minors (all further writes won't be accounted).

There is a more serious issue that you assume as easy to solve:
	how do you know when the ramdisk driver should stop working?
You should tell the ramdisk driver "stop allocating memory" when the
_buffer_ allocation fails, and at buffer allocation time the buffer is
still freeable (innocent) and even worse getblk is just an oom-deadlock
prone thing even without ramdisk involved.....
The point is that you can't just look at the number of free pages and look
at how many pages are in the page-LRU queue inside the request callback to
know if the system is oom or not. Only after a failed allocation you could
choose to say "ok, this is real OOM and so the ramdisk driver must stop
working". Otherwise you risk to overstimate or understimate, because you
don't know how much of the allocated memory is freeable or swappable.
And only stopping generating protected data can be not enough to avoid a
deadlock.
And stopping working if there we are low on memory would imply that a
malicious memory-hog launced by an luser during the ramdisk construction,
could potentially generate fs corruption on the ramdisk.

invalidate_buffers just works per minor basis. You can just say flushb
/dev/ram0 and only release the memory for the 0 ramdisk minor.

Any fix I can think of, looks worse than the missing check itself 8)
