You miss the point.
sigevent has nothing necessarily to do with signals.  I don't want
signals.  I just want the same interface to specify the action to be used.
If I'm using
  struct sigevent sigev;
  int kfd;
  kfd = kevent_create (...);
  sigev.sigev_notify = SIGEV_KEVENT;
  sigev.sigev_kfd = kfd;
  sigev.sigev_valie.sival_ptr = &some_data;
then I can use this sigev variable in an unmodified timer_create call.
The kernel would see SIGEV_KEVENT (as opposed to SIGEV_SIGNAL etc) and
**not** generate a signal but instead create the event in the kevent queue.
The proposal to use sigevent has nothing to do with signals.  It's just
about the interface and to have smooth integration with existing
functionality.
