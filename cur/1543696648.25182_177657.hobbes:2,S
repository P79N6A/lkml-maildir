| This is not the real fix.

| Instead, just make /proc/interrupts use the proper _sequence_ things, so

| "s_next()" thing to print them out one at a time. The seqfile interfaces
| will then do the rigth thing with blocking/caching, and you only need a
| single page.
| 
| Al - do we have some good documentation of how to use the seq-file 
| interface? 
See  
http://lwn.net/Articles/22355/
and  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/doc/seq_file_howto.txt
| In the meantime, without documentation, the best place to look is just at 
| other examples. One such example would be the kernel/kallsyms.c case: see 
| how it does s_start/s_show/s_next/s_stop (or /proc/slabinfo, or vmstat, or 
| any number of them).
