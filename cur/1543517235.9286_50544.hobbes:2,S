G'Day David,
    Have you tried putting heat conductive compound between the BX chip
itself and its heat-sink?  This has been recommended by the Abit BP6
overclockers <
http://www.bp6.com/bx>
 as a generic BX chipset cooling
strategy.
We have several Epox BXBS (dual slot I) boards, and all have been
crashing/freezing routinely every few days (for months; a real pain in
the behind) under any/all of SMP Linux/SMPFreeBSD/Windoze(95/UP;
NT/SMP)... I reasoned that cooling couldn't hurt, and I tried it on one
of the BXBSs to good effect.  (There is no room for an active fan on the
board, so I just used heat conductive compound...)
So far, I've reached nearly 2 weeks uptime on the unit that I've cooled
(Linux 2.2.13), and that is well out into the extreme of the
distribution of TBFs that we had been observing. If (when?!) it reaches
2 weeks uptime, I'm going to declare victory and cool all of the BX
boards that we have in the building...
Hope this helps (and obviously, YMMV :-)
    Cheers,
        Frank Horowitz
