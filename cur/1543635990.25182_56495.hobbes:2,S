   Long ago (10-15 internet-years ago..) I followed testing of
   FFS-family of filesystems in Squid cache.
   We noticed at Solaris machines using UFS, than when the directory
   data size grew above the number of blocks directly addressable by
   the direct-index pointers in the i-node, system speed plummeted.
   (Or perhaps it was something a bit smaller, like 32 kB)
   Consider:  4 kB block size, 12 direct indexes: 48 kB directory size.
   Spend 16 bytes for each file name + auxiliary data: 3000 files/subdirs
   Optimal would be to store the files inside only the first block,
   e.g. the directory shall not grow over 4k (or 1k, or ..)
   Name subdirs as:  00 thru 7F (128+2, 12 bytes ?)
   Possibly do that in 2 layers:  128^2 = 16384 subdirs, each
   with 50 long named users (even more files?): 820 000 users.
   Tune the subdir hashing function to suit your application, and
   you should be happy.
   Putting all your eggs in one basket (files in one directory)
   is not a smart thing.
