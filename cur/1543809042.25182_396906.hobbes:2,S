Found and fixed. It's a missed rollback_patch on one of the two branches of 
the code that checks if a patch can be reverse applied. This case apparently 
doesn't trigger as easily as it seems, or else we would have found it sooner. 
Still quite bad.
Shall we wait until the translations are up-to-date again, or release 0.44 
immediately?

You should have sent your gquilt announcement to the quilt-dev list as well. 
Thank you for summarizing the changes.
