In my particular case that's true, so I only depended on kswapd as a 
side effect of the memory allocation logic. Setting PF_MEMALLOC fixed that.

In the general case that's not sufficient. What if the NFS server wrote 
to ext3 via the VFS? We might have a ton of ext3 pagecache waiting for 
kswapd to reclaim NFS memory, while kswapd is waiting on the NFS server 
writing to ext3.
The patch I posted is simple and quite sufficient for my needs, but I'm 
sure more convoluted cases will turn up where something more complex is 
needed. Probably one can construct such cases out of in-kernel 
components like the loop device, dm, and the NFS client and server.
