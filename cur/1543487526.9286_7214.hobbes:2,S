Hello,
it's really going to become a time mega-patch. I have fixed all the 
obvious problems in snapshot #2, and now I brought you snapshot #3 
for the weekend.
Some tests indicated (on a Pentium-100 using TSC) that time 
occasionally runs backward in the fractional second (in 15 of 2000000 
samples). I'll have to investigate that...
Using ntp-4.0.91f required some patches, because the "struct timex" 
lacks some magic from Dave Mills. Maybe even, that ntp version still 
has some bugs. I don't want to decide too early. PPS has significant 
jitter, too.
Maybe have a look. Compilation problems for some networking stuff 
should be fixed now, and the new MOD_* bits can be really used now.
The patch is a 100%-patch that is based on 2.2.1, but should apply 
with little fuzz to 2.2.2 too.
URLs: PPSkit-0.6-i386-pre3.diff.gz is on master.kernel.org in 
/pub/linux/daemons/ntp/PPS and on
