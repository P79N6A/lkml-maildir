this is indeed too ugly, and if we do it we'll get both this ugliness 
and the CPU loop upstream forever. Frank, if you dont have time to fix 
this code, then i guess the best thing is to do the full revert that 
Peter sent.
Regarding this teardown bug. Stupid question: why cannot the signal 
structure live as long as the last user is around? It's a tiny amount 
of RAM.
