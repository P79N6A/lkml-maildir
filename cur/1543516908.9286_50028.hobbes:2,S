So we could reimplement a rmb() (and in turn an mb()) that scales in SMP?
Something like:
	#define rmb()	... "movb $0, ZERO_PAGE+32*smp_processor_id()"
This because the spin_unlock really is:
	mb();
	spin_lock.lock = 0;
If spin_unlock() doesn't need the lock, mb() doesn't need the lock
on the bus either.
Am I missing something?
