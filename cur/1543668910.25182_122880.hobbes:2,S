Changing the device between usb printers.
I have several usb printers, each have a device to work 
/dev/usb/lp0.../dev/usb/lp1/...etc. an example for the problem. If I 
turn off 2 printers, printer #1 (/dev/usb/lp0)and printer #2 
(/dev/usb/lp1)  if i turn on first printer#2 and later printer #1 I got 
for printer#2 to /dev/usb/lp0 and printer #1 (/dev/usb/lp1), if the 
printers are the same is not a problem but if the printers aren't the 
same then exist a problem  when I send to print. I put a dmesg in 
console and I got messages from "hub.c" that it put the number of 
bus3/3/1 for a printer and bus3/3/2 to another but "printer.c" put 
always usblp0 for the first printer detected and usblp1 to another. I 
think that "printer.c" must to follow the same idea that hub.c to use 
like /dev/usb/bus/3/3/2/lp or something like that
I have a Mandrake 9.0 distribution, I try with the kernel 2.4.20 and 
2.4.21-pre6 too, all have the same problem
Thank you
