freeze_processes and thaw_processes is not needed by the migrate

I do not think this is necessary because 
freezing and awakening are not done concurrently. First you will 
freeze a number of processes (and no awakening occurs).
Then some action occurs (migration, suspend). Then complete_all 
is invoked. No freezing occurs during the awakening period.
It would be great if you can fix this issue with a patch. But taking a 
lock only makes sense if you can use it to coordinate multiple updates
of variables. I.e. take siglock for clearing PF_FROZEN and TIF_FREEZE and
then use it while checking the state of PF_FROZEN and TIF_FREEZE.
