I have a Seagate Hawke:

This is under Kernel 2.2.13 with devfs.
Now, the problem is that aprox every 4 to 5 seconds, there are 4 writes
(according to /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0).  This is a problem because the
repetitve clicking noise is, well, in my room.  Imagine sleeping next to a
metrinome -- I sleep next to these machines (being they're in my room and
all).
My first responce was to use a combination of nannie (a program which
monitors files for any changes) and lsof (listing open files).  I tracked
down a daemon that would write to a file every 5 seconds.  As I had the
source, I modified it to write the log, then exit.  Then I set it as a cron
job.  Problem solved......  or not.  The regular writing continued.  The 4
random writes every 4 to 5 seconds were really getting to me.  
Here is the debug log of the SCSI driver:

Now, I'm not a master of the scsi.c internals (far from it), and I don't
really spend much time poking at the kernel (I'm not that good), but a large
amount of zeroes like that makes me wonder what is wrong.  Is it a driver
problem?  Should I downgrade back to 2.2.9?  Any feedback is appreciated.
(CC:ing will get my attention better as I skim the digest ver and could miss
replies there)
