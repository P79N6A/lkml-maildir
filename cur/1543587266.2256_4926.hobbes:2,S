Using a signal to hit init with is a bit dubious because most signals
are hooked up for something else already. For example, SIGTERM sent to
my init (
http://john.snoop.dk/programs/linux/jinit
) would shutdown and
start sulogin, which is probably not what you want when you press the
off button. The FreeBSD init is similar FWIW (goes to single user
mode).
Some PM interfaces (e.g. APM) require a descision to be made by
software on such an event (to turn off or to "reject"). IMHO the best
way to do this is to exec a small script from kernelspace to get the
user's preferred policy; this is lighter weight than a daemon, doesn't
require some nasty magic number interface, and can be easily
programmed by any admin knowing sh or perl or whatever.
