No. I asked how _significant_ the difference is, as compared to the rest of
the accesses it makes.

There are problems with purely per-CPU stacks if you run with interrupts
enabled. You theoretically ought to have a stack big enough to allow all
possible interrupts to be nested on one CPU.
And having non-uniform stack sizes of course introduces other
problems... notably the fact that you can no longer locate the thread_info
struct by means of AND-ing the stack pointer.

I wonder if it might be possible to invalidate just that bit of the
cache... though I suspect that's not worth it, even if it is.
