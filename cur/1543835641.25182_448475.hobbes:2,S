That requires a copy, which can neglect syscall overhead.
Do we really want it to be done?

And how "misordering" between queue and buffer is going to be managed?
I.e. when buffer is full and events are placed into queue, so syscall
could get them, and then syscall is called to get events from the queue
but not from the buffer - we can endup taking events from buffer while
old are placed in the queue.
And how waiting will be done without syscalls? Will glibc take care of
it?

Ok, let's do it in the following way:
I present new version of kevent with new syscalls and fixed issues mentioned
before, while people look at it we can end up with mapped buffer design.
Is it ok?
