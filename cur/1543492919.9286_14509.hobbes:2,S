Christoph,
It is bus reset that is wiping you out.
I would like to think it is not the sg device driver because it
remained unaltered from 2.2.5-ac2 to -ac7 (version 2.1.31) while
2.2.5-ac1 was only slightly different (version 2.1.30). 
Production kernels 2.2.0 through 2.2.5 all have the original sg
driver.
So the problem seems uncorrelated to changes in the sg device driver.
Your note suggests the failure was induced by a change between
2.2.5-ac2 and -ac3 but Alan's release note says nothing about
a change to either ide-scsi or sg in that patch (and nothing
in that area changed in -ac4 either).
Perhaps Jens may have some ideas?
