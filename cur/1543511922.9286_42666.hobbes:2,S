	The bug was present in 2.2.7 and I mailed to tytso@mit.edu on 10 May and
	it (bug) seems to have disappeared but now we have something even more
	interesting. Attempt to use the "-o loop=/dev/loop0" syntax as in:
	dd if=/dev/zero of=image bs=4096 count=1000
	mke2fs image
	mount -t ext2 -o loop=/dev/loop0 image /mnt
	results in a massive (infinite?) amount of messages in kernel log saying 
	"hm, busy page invalidated? (not necesserily a bug)\n" coming from
	invalidate_inode_pages() of mm/filemap.c (this is 2.3.19). Note that I do
	NOT get all these messages if do losetup /dev/loop0 image first and then
	mount -t ext /dev/loop0 /mnt.
Precisely the same things happen, however.
(Roughly speaking, mount just calls losetup, so there should not
be any difference. If you can reproduce a difference in behaviour
then this is not a kernel matter, since both approaches should
result in precisely the same sequence of system calls, namely
	ioctl(LOOP_SET_FD);
	ioctl(LOOP_SET_STATUS);
	mount();
but it would be a mount and/or losetup bug. You might mail me,
I maintain both.)
On the other hand, if you try something twice and the second time
differs from the first, that need not have anything to do with
mount vs losetup.
Finally, you can save a little bit of typing using
	mount -t ext2 -o loop image /mnt
in which case mount will use the first loop device that is
not yet in use. (Probably you knew.)
