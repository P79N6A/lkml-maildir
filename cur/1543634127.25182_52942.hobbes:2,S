Subject: [2.4.18/2.4.19 IDE] cannot read(2) from IDE-DVD-ROM drive

Hi folks,
I have a MATSHITADVD-ROM SR-8176 (as reported in /proc) on a i830 chipset 
integrated IDE controller running with PIIX4 drivers in a 2.4.18 or 
2.4.19-pre10 kernel. Everything works fine except read()ing and e.g. 
llseek()ing on that drive when a DVD-ROM is inserted. CD-ROM make now 
problems but DVD-ROMs (_not_ video DVDs with that RPC crap but data DVDs). 
I can mount them and use them but I simply cannot use basic file operations. 
I verified the following:
sam:~# mount /dev/hdc -t iso9660 /cdrom/
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
sam:~# ls /cdrom/
audio_ts     desktop  dvd	gamestarter.exe  patches    start.exe
autorun.inf  directx  extras	leser		 programme  treiber
demos	     dlh      gamestar	mods		 screens    video_ts
sam:~# umount /cdrom/
sam:~# dd if=/dev/hdc of=/tmp/test
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
sam:~# cat /dev/hdc
# test.c is quoted at the end of that mail
sam:~# ./test /dev/hdc
read 0 bytes
All that works with CD-ROMs in that drive and google had nothing to say
about that phenomenon.
Any objections?
Thanks in advance,
  Joerg

test.c as used for the test above:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#define __USE_LARGEFILE64
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int fd, c;
        char buf[4096];
        if(argc < 2)
                exit(1);
        if((fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)) == -1) {
                printf("open failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                exit(1);
        }
        if((c = read(fd, buf, 4096)) == -1) {
                printf("read failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                close(fd);
                exit(1);
        }
        printf("read %d bytes\n", c);
        close(fd);
        return 0;
}
