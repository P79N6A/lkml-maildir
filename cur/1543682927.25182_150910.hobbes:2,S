What you're forgetting is that the goal of the GPL is to promote freedom 
not prosecution. You don't do this via litigations, this way you only 
alienate everyone, but you don't win support for free software.
The free software movement is a social movement not a legal movement. In 
court you only reach short term effects, but if people vote with their 
wallet you can achieve a lot more profound results.
