True, irman2 is a very nasty little bugger.
Your method works well here.  With your patch in test1+G4, I can run irman2 
and still have a quite usable system.  It could possibly use a little 
refinement though.  If xmms happens to run out of slice at a time when you 
determine that starvation is in progress, it'll nail the innocent xmms (or 
other very light task).
I went a different route in tackling irman2 to avoid the pain of expiring X 
(glitch), but really there's no difference between X and xmms... they 
should both be run RR if you want 100% glitch free operation (and thus 
would be exempted from punishment under your method, and mine as well)
