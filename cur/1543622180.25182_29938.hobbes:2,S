Because it was related to ide-tape (which I don't use) and
it also was about the tape not working at all or with massive amounts
of errors. Which I already know, bacause I tried it.
I now run with the SCSI emulation (scsi_mod, ide-scsi etc) and it
seems to *almost* work fine...
I'll try with DMA off and see what happens, but that should slow down
the other HDD on the bus, right?
Is there any known problems with changing the DMA settings back
and forth on a live production system?
