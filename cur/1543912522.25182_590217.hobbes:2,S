If so, and since that's obviously what people _expect_ to happen, why not 
make that the default, with the "consistent" behaviour being the one that 
needs an explicit option.
Just out of curiosity - Hua, is this NFSv2? Especially there, cache 
"consistency" is largely a joke anyway, so defaulting to some annoying 
careful mode is doubly ridiculous.
