Fix pcmcia_device_remove NULL pointer dereference at shutdown.
Signed-off-by: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

Unlike its older brother, this oops has not yet graduated from -mm to
mainline.  I've not yet seen my cards working in -mm (maybe intermittent
anomaly at my end), and saw oops when removing and inserting card; but
follow those issues up another time, this is a good start just for
closing down the box.
