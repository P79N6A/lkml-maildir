Yes. But a Hayes modem wants a bit more than just RTS/CTS handshaking.

That's not my idea.
If we want to support modems (Hayes-compatible) we need to make sure,
in addition to CRTSCTS, that we don't send anything when DCD (or DSR)
is down - and then we probably need another option.
BTW I think you know all of this very well for years.
