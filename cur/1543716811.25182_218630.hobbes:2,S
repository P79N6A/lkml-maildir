Hi all,
currently arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c file looks like complete
mess. Interfacing with other kernel subsystem made using
ad-hoc ways, mostly with ugly global variables, additionaly
coding style is ... not good. So these patches appear:
	patch-dmi-1-matches - simplify DMI blacklist table by
removing the need to fill unused slots with NO_MATCH macro.
	patch-dmi-2-api - separate and export dmi_check_system()
function (along with some needed declarations) which checks given
DMI id table against system DMI data and runs callback functions 
when necessary.
	patch-dmi-3-whitespace - various coding style cleanups.
	patch-dmi-4-sonypi - make sonypi driver use dmi_check_system()
function and remove is_sony_vaio_laptop global variable.
	patch-dmi-5-apm - make APM BIOS driver use dmi_check_system()
function and move all related quirks into apm.c.
	patch-dmi-6-pciirq - make pci irq routing code use 
dmi_check_system() function and make broken_hp_bios_irq9 variable 
static.
	patch-dmi-7-smbus - make PIIX4 I2C use dmi_check_system()
function and remove is_unsafe_smbus global variable.
Please take a look.
Best regards.
