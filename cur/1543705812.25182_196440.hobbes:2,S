I finally got around to testing this in tiny, and it works quite well.
I actually got it working in my mem=2m test case, though it was a
little tight.
It's the philosophy of -tiny to make all new features optional, so I'm
currently in the process of making it a config option and am going
back through and adding CONFIG_SYSFS_BACK. Will post a new version
as part of my next -tiny shortly.
