irtty is dabbed as broken in Makefile.
Question - is it fundamentally broken, sometimes broken or under special 
conditions broken? :)
I need to decide if I replace default ldisc-11 by irtty-sir in 2.6 (risking 
that some dongles stop working for some people) or leave it as irtty and tell 
guys who build kernel to use CONFIG_IRTTY_OLD
TIA
