We need to combine this with my original patch description of the
aio-dio-fallback + follow on patch which had the race that Daniel
fixed and then rolled together into one working patch.
Does the following sound better as complete description ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This patch ensures that when the DIO code falls back to buffered i/o 
after having submitted part of the i/o, then buffered i/o is issued only
for the remaining part of the request (i.e. the part not already
covered by DIO), rather than redo the entire i/o.
We need to careful not to access dio fields if its possible that 
the dio could already have been freed asynchronously during i/o 
completion. A tricky part of this involves plugging the window between 
the decrement of bio_count and accessing dio->waiter during i/o 
completion where the dio could get freed by the submission path. 
This potential "bio_count race" was tackled (by Daniel) by changing 
bio_list_lock into bio_lock and using that for all the bio fields. 
Now bio_count and bios_in_flight have been converted from atomics 
into int and are both protected by the bio_lock. The race in 
finished_one_bio() could thus be fixed by leaving the bio_count at 1 
until after the dio_complete() and then doing the bio_count decrement 
and wakeup holding the bio_lock. It appears that shifting to the
spin_lock instead of atomic_inc/decs is ok performance wise as 
well.
