Much higher than 30-50 - but yes, the total bandwidth won't exceed
the slowest channel.

SCSI won't get you a faster PCI bus.  Guys, *PLEASE*, - everyone on this list
knows what the respective virtues and horrors of SCSI and IDE are.   Configured
properly, both can perform well, configured wrongly, both will suck.
The timings below are from a dual PII-350, Asus P2B-DS, it has a six disk SCSI
RAID and a five disk IDE RAID.  The IDE raid is configured properly with one
channel per disk - which would have solved the performance problem in the array
that spawned this thread. 
(By the way: the SCSI RAID is configured with three controllers for the six
disks, because of the low SCSI bus bandwidth, reality rules in the SCSI world
as well)
Kernel is 2.2, RAID is 0.90, IDE is Andre's

Dual PII-350, 256 MB RAM, test on 1 GB file
Filesystem:  75 GB ext2fs
RAID:        Linux Softare RAID-5
Disks:       5 pcs. IBM Deskstar 75 GXP (30GB)
Controller:  3 pcs. Promise PDC-2067

Same box, test on 1 GB file

This array is built on other partitions on the same disks as above.

44 MB/sec write, 98 MB/sec read on RAID-0.  That's thru *one* PCI bus folks.
Please, for further comments or another IDE-hotplug-can!-cannot!-can-so!, let's
take this to linux-raid or #offtopic   ;)
Enough said.
