I can't reproduce this on my system at all, I've got an i815 (slightly
newer chipset than i810 - maybe something in that...) but I've just
compiled a kernel with the i810 drm built in and started X in 24-bit
color on 2.6.9 without incident...
I'm running Xorg 6.8.0-rc3.... its wierd I've no idea what could be
causing it ...
Dave.
