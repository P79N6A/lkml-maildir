	Hi all, i finally got a good copy of glibc-2.1.1 and i decided to
change to the UNIX 98 pty's instead of the normal tty's, i have done what says
in the Changes document and everything works fine, the devpts fs is mounted and
all but i am not yet using the new pty's, if i give the command tty it still
says /dev/ttyX, what i'm missing ??? have i ti get more new software or change
something in the init scripts, i'm using a RH system with kernel 2.2.6 compiled
and running ok with egcs-1.1.2.........
	thanks.......
