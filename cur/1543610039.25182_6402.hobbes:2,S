Yes, this is much closer to what's happening.  I'd bet that most
Palomino chips would pass the smp tests,  meaning many more MPs than
they'd ever need.    They're probably just putting a bucket in the
manufacturing stream,   testing those, and putting the rejects back
in the stream.

Umm...I cant see chips that have already been marked as MPs being
converted to XPs.     Odds are the ratio of XP to MP is probably 10:1
or greater.

...and considering AMD doesnt lag in bringing out MPs.  Right now
XP 1900s are widely available, but the highest speed MP's are 1800s.
I've heard that the AMD 762 northbridge only works up to 12.5x133
(1666MHz) so they'll hit the wall with the MPs pretty soon unless they
have an updated stepping.
