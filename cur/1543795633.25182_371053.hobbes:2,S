Subject: [RFC] Porting Nooks to 2.6

Dear All,
Sorry if this list is not appropriate for this post.
I would like to port Nooks to 2.6 kernel.
Nooks (
http://nooks.cs.washington.edu/
) is a lightweight kernel protection
sub system that isolates device drivers from kernels thus increasing the
reliability of the kernel.Its initial implementation is done in 2.4.18.
My questions are:
1. Does anyone already ported it to 2.6, if yes could you please give me
some guidelines?
2. If not could any one point me to any document/tips that will help me to
port it.
Thanks in advance for your concern -- Hirotaka MOTAI
