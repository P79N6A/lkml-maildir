The above doesn't describe the bug very well.

This is the problem to which you're referring, yes?
We're comparing milliseconds with jiffies/HZ, yes?

I don't particularly like the idea of relying on msecs_to_jiffies(too much)
returning a negative value.
Why can't we do
	int too_much;
	/*
	 * We compare HZ with 1000 to work out which side of the expression
	 * needs conversion.  Because we want to avoid converting any value
	 * to a numerically higher value, which could overflow.
	 */
#if HZ > 1000
	too_much = timeout > jiffies_to_msecs(MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT);
#else
	too_much = msecs_to_jiffies(timeout) > MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
#endif
	if (too_much)
		timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
And while we're there, let's stop using the same variable for two different
units - it's horrid.  How about we nuke `timeout' and create timeout_msecs
and timeout_jiffies to show what units they're in?
