I'd say you've ZERO chance to run just new kernel.  You will need more
recent glibc, never softraid tools, you will discover that /dev/hdXX are
all gone, and so on.

Well.  I'd say it's not that obvious.  For example, I can't boot redhat-6.0
system with current 2.6 kernel (I once tried that, probably with 2.6.9 or
something - there were quite.. some problems.  Upgrading several packages,
including glibc compiled against 2.6 kernel, solved that. Some stuff was
still broken, but I didn't try hard).  BTW, devfs is just one example...
try to boot a one-year-old gentoo distro (not 42, but 1) with current
2.6 without devfs... ;)
Another point is: why the heck you want to boot such 42-years-old system
with current "best, grestest" kernel, anyway?

Heh. Yes it is.
