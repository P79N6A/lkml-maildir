We (well Peter and Vojtech mostly as I don't have ALPS touchpad in my
box) are trying to make ALPS work as it was working before even
without Synaptics X driver without any additional options, please bear
with us.
Still I think having Synaptics driver installed is the best way in the
end simply because it has a lot of knobs so one can adjust tpouchpad's
behavior to his/her liking. Maybe once distibutions start packaging
and activating it by default it will be less of an issue.
