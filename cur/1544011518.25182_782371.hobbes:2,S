Although it may be okay for CDs, I suspect that approach won't work for 
disks.
For one thing, this would cause the volume size to change after the 
partition table had been read and interpreted, which doesn't seem like 
a good idea.
For another, it would cause the location of the "last" sector to change 
in mid-flight, which might well cause problems for programs like vol_id 
and hald_probe_storage -- they need to read the last sector to 
determine if the volume is part of a RAID array.
Now maybe these objections won't matter; the code in each case might be 
resilient enough to handle such changes.  Do you think it could work?
