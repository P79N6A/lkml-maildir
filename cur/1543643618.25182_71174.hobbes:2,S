hmm, not sure if it's better to slowdown vmalloc instead of
/proc/meminfo and to keep meminfo o1. In theory vmalloc should be used
only for persistent infrequent allocations, so meminfo has a chance to
be recalled more frequently with monitors like xosview during workloads.
Admittedly in final production with no monitoring meminfo is going to
never be recalled, however I like the idea to keep meminfo very quick.
