The guilty patch is:
ntp-add-ntp_update_frequency.patch
Up to and including the previous patch,
wich is ntp-move-all-the-ntp-related-code-to-ntpc-fix.patch,
everything is fine.  But apply this one, and
time moves at 3x speed.  This makes games interesting,
and the keyboard autorepeat awesome. :-)
The patch found seems reasonable, it is 
definitely time-related.
Thanks to all who sent a tutorial on quilt bisection!
