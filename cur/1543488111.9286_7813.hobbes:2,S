Darn. Screw #4 - it doesn't solve anything. Add #5: block on close()
(maybe make it an setsockopt()-controllable). BTW, from my reading of
kern/uipc_userreq.c it looks like freebsd-hackers folks might be also
interested in situation - I'm not on FreeBSD box, but from what I see in
source they are also vulnerable...
