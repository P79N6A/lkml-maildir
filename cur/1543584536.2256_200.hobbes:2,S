rm -r does not do un-expected things, and it does not corrupt your file
system, it merely removes it.  That is the only thing it does, and it
does it every time.
However, messing with the hdparms options can do random things, at
least from my perspective as a user:  It may bring exciting new performance
to your system, and it may subtly, or not so, corrupt your file system.
If the drivers can detect what type of HD/chipset we are using, surely
it can know not to allow the user to do stupid things that are out of
spec w/regards to the hardware?
For the power/insane user, there could be a --really-do-stupid-thing-i-told-you-to
option, and it should be that hard to type!!
