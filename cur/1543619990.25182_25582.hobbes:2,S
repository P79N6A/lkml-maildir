I mean I added a usleep() before the poll in s_bsd.c for the undernet
2.10.10 code.
 timeout = (IRCD_MIN(delay2, delay)) * 1000;
 + usleep(100000); <- New Line
 nfds = poll(poll_fds, pfd_count, timeout);
And now we're using 1/8th the cpu! With no noticeable effects.
Regards
Darren.

Were you not putting a delay argument into poll(), or perhaps not
letting
it delay long enough?  If you just do poll with a timeout of 0, its
going
to suck lots of cpu.
