Well, I've swapped memory with an identical machine and the problem 
stayed where it was.  The crash is fairly frequent (about 1-2 days of 
operating).

I would have expected 2 CPU temps (being dual-processor).  Maybe Remote 
is the second.
With 4 copies of burnK7:
machine with problems:
CPU:      +71.25°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +50°C)     ALARM
Board:    +47.25°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +35°C)     ALARM
Remote:   +68.50°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +35°C)     ALARM
machine without:
CPU:      +61.25°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +50°C)     ALARM
Board:    +47.25°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +35°C)     ALARM
Remote:   +74.25°C  (low  =   +10°C, high =   +35°C)     ALARM
So *maybe* cooling?
