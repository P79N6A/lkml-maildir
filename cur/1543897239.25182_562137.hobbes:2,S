Ok, I'm reassured. I'll look into converting these to a work queue
then, although I can't promise when I'll get around to it.
In fact, if these timing requirements are so easy to meet, perhaps
it doesn't even need its own work queue, and just making each
tasklet into a work item and queueing them to the global queue
with schedule_work() would do? Or am I getting too reckless now?
Thanks,
Tilman
