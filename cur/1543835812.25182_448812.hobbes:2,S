Sure, this particular instance is in journal_write_metadata_buffer
where the bh may be constructed from kmalloc memory (search for the
call to jbd_rep_kmalloc).  Because the memory returned by kmalloc
may straddle a page (when slab debugging is enabled that is), this
causes a broken bh to be injected into submit_bh.
Cheers,
