Subject: maybe klogd 100% usage in 2.2.12 again?

Dear Alan,
Sorry to bother you but I've just grabbed 2.2.12 from the web and noticed
that this patch from Andrea was not in it:
-
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.11/printk-races-2.2
.11-C
- 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.11/printk-races-2.2.11-C
It solved the klogd 100% cpu usage in 2.2.1[01] perfectly for me so I
applied it to my brand new
2.2.12 as well to prevent klogd to go mad again.
I had no problems with that since kernel/printk.c was not changed in
2.2.11->2.2.12 as far as I can tell.
-> Maybe I have missed something that makes Andrea's printk-patch for
2.2.12 unnecessary ?
I don't know the exact way of getting such patches in the main 2.2.x
kernels and I don't
understand enough about Linux kernel programming to even understand the
patch but I think
it should be considered to go in the 2.2.x some day because having a
looping klogd eating
away CPU time is not very nice...
I'm having an SMP box, and old dual P133 HX board (tyan S1563D). It runs
very smoothly and rock stable. No real need for an athlon yet...
BTW: Your linux release notes and your diary on 
http://www.linux.org.uk
 are
 wonderful! Keep up the excellent work.
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / best regards
