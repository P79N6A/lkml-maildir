I second this statement, having a method of implementing early boot
userspace options is a very good thing to have, and one that the distros
really want (as they have already been doing it on their own in
different ways, some using klibc already, others using uclibc, and still
others using glibc.)  Standardizing on a method to implement this is
very much needed.
