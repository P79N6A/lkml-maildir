The problem was I didn't have scsi / scsi_disk support..
Also I forgot to mount usbdevfs (but which is only informative,afai can see).
It's a little bit weired to have scsi support for usb discs..
perhaps scsi / scsi_disk should be splitted into _real_ scsi support
and generic modular (block) device support..
like mod_disk, mod_cdrom, mod_tape. 
What do you think about this ?
