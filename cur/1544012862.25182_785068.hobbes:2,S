Thanks!
One idea worth pondering might be to provide a special struct
mii_if_info hookup (fully emulated mdio_read()/write())
for the case of the non-MII hardware types of this driver,
thus eliminating any added penalty in the case of nicely MII-compliant
hardware.
But this should be tackled later, now let's better move on with eepro100
(non-)plans...
