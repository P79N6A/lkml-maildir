That sounds very accurate :)

OK. But if the timer interrupt is separated from updating the time,
the next timer interrupt should be programmable to happen exactly
when a HRT timer needs it, right?
Hmm, how about using a pool of programmable timers available on the 
system for the timer interrupts and HRT? Or is one interrupt source
always enough?
