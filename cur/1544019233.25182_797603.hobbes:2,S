I don't get it.
If code has
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(dmi, x);
and correctly includes mod_devicetable.h then that code will be
expanded and compiled happily by all compiler versions?  Or not?
Under what circumstances does it fail?  Presumably if some header files
weren't included?  If so, why is that specific to a gcc version?
Or something else.  I have no idea.  Sigh.  New changelog, please.
