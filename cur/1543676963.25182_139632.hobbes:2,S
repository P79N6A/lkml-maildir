Hello!
I have the following question.
My system is 2x 2.4Ghz Xeons.
Linux kernel 2.4.18 compiled with SMP support sees it as four processors. 
SMP-disabled kernel sees one, of course.
I would like to know, how will it influence the system performance, if I run a 
UP kernel?
What does the kernel SMP support add? Just some API for additinal 
multiprocessor control? Will the SMP-enabled kernel run faster than the UP 
one?
That's what I would like to know.
Thanks!
Artemio.
