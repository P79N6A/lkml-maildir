That's a pretty big restriction.  Plus, you can't claim spinlocks.
The panic shutdown is different from an orderly shutdown.  What the 
current shutdown does is probably not what you want.

The API is not done for panics.  There's no call that has the proper 
semantics.

I don't understand this.  If you can't trust a dying kernel to properly 
shut down devices, how can you trust it to boot a new kernel?  And (much 
worse) if you don't shut down the devices, how can you trust the new 
kernel to execute properly?  I know there are levels of trust here, but 
I'd much rather have the kernel lockup during the reboot than have a 
chance of a new kernel booting that could behave incorrectly.  In 
general, the chance of behaving incorrectly is MUCH worse than a sure 
lockup, especially in systems that must be reliable.
