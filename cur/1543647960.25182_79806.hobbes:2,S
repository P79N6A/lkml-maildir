I get the following error on Red Hat 7.2:
g++ -O2 -Wall -g -fPIC -I/usr/lib/qt-2.3.1/include -c qconf.cc -o qconf.o
In file included from lkc.h:10,
                 from qconf.cc:22:
zconf.tab.h:8: conflicting types for `typedef union YYSTYPE YYSTYPE'
zconf.tab.h:8: previous declaration as `typedef union YYSTYPE YYSTYPE'
zconf.tab.h:38: conflicting types for `YYSTYPE zconflval'
zconf.tab.h:38: previous declaration as `YYSTYPE zconflval'
when trying to build the lkc package on it's own.
But when using the provided patch, make xconfig built the program just
fine.
Either way, nice job, I like the new format and the speed.
thanks,
