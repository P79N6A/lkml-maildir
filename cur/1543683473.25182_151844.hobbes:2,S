Thanks for pointing this out, they seem to have removed the module reference 
counting. But really, I don't care whether it can unload or not. I just need 
it to work. I'm not really interested in perfecting a quick hack to a 
proprietary driver.

Ah, so THATS who they licensed it from. I didn't think nividia would go to the 
bother of designing their own ethernet hardware. I'll have a poke about and 
see if I can find anything out about the MAC address
