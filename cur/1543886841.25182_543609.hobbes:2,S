This isn't just an opinion, this is the language the Linux kernel is
written in today, and has been for the duration of its 16-year
existence.  It contains *many* constructs that are not defined in, for
example, C99, and it would in fact be impossible to write the Linux
kernel using only C99-compliant constructs.

There is no such "slightly more portable/larger context/well-defined and
understood" context in existence.  If you think so, you're deluding
yourself.
