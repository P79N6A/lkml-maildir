It pushes ALL of (used) memory out to swap.

No.
First of all, it would have to map ALL of kernel memory, or you would
have to change the way things like dentries, inodes, and namespaces are
allocated in the kernel itself.
Second, you still would have no stability across kernel versions.
Third, you would have to accept total data loss on unclean shutdown,
because tmpfs doesn't care about coherency, *NOR SHOULD IT*.  This is
the fundamental reason why allocating a large swap partition and making
/tmp a tmpfs can give a *huge* performance boost, even though it still
hits disk.
What you're talking about is, *and should be*, a different filesystem.
You will relatively quickly find that you have to deal with the same
kind of stuff that you have to in any filesystem.
