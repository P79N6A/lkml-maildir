Hi Alan.
There's one config option that looks to me to be over complex as
far as the user trying to configure the Linux kernel is concerned
and I'd like to suggest that the following patch be applied to
deal with this.
Basically, the existing option is essentially a choice list, but
for some reason has been specified as an integer using magic
numbers for the associated values. I've no idea how this sneaked
in, but if magic values are to be used, they should be strictly
in the *.c and *.h files, not in the configuration scripts, at
least in my opinion.
Note also that the existing config.in file entry doesn't document
the option valued 2, but the existing *.c file entry implies that
such an option exists and is valid. I've labelled it "GodKnows"
in this patch, but if somebody can document what it really is,
that would be very much preferred...
