Before you start shouting, how about you get your numbers right? Your 
first numbers were wrong and the second numbers are still wrong:
$ find -name \*,v -a ! -path ./BitKeeper\* -a ! -name ChangeSet,v | xargs rlog | egrep -e '^[0-9]{4}(/[0-9]{2}){2} [0-9]{2}(:[0-9]{2}){2}' -e '\(Logical change 1.[0-9]+\)' | wc -l
219242
$ find -name \*,v -a ! -path ./BitKeeper\* -a ! -name ChangeSet,v | xargs rlog | egrep '\(Logical change 1.[0-9]+\)' | wc -l
187576
That would bring us back to 85% and I leave it to you to find the bug.

The 44% number deserves an explanation, which our good friend Larry would 
have you believe is completely unimportant and thinking otherwise is just 
"FUD". Actually on the contrary it is the more important number.
The 85% number means that the history of a _single_ file can be restored 
with a precision of 85% via bkcvs. If one is only interested in the 
history of a single file, that 85% might be sufficient. OTOH a change to 
the kernel is rarely just a change to a single file. A patch can consist 
of changes to multiple files and this relationship between multiple single 
file changes can only be restored with a precision of 44% via bkcvs.
IOW if one wants to not just look at some random file history, but 
actually restore and use some of it, one can only get 44% of the 59220 
snapshots of kernel history.

Hmm, that argument is not exactly original anymore. If Linus would say, 
that kernel history has to be exclusively recorded via bk and that the 
history available via bkcvs is the maximum that must be made available to 
other users, you would have a point.
So it's quite legitimate to at least ask occasionally how the 44% 
granularity can be improved. CVS is obviously not really capable of it, 
but RCS on which CVS is based on is. I attached an example script which 
can convert the history of a bk file into RCS. The only thing that is 
missing is to 1) generate a list revisions with their parents, 2) checkout 
a given revision, 3) generate the log for a given revision. (*) I'm quite 
sure that's trivial to do for you and this only took me a few hours 
including testing and cleanup, it only takes a little more work to make 
CVS happy and allow incremental updates, so your "3 month" number is 
absolutely ridiculous.
Any bk user can now easily prove or disprove this by completing my example 
script, I think the "bk prs" man page should be very helpful here. If you 
want to complete it into your very own bk2cvs script, I'd be happy to 
help.
bye, Roman
(*) In case anyone thinks this is simple without bk, try to find the 
parents for this changeset
