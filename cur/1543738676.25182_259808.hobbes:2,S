Subject: [patch 3/6] uml: finish update for 2.6.8 API changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/11/323

Add some updates for API changes in 2.6.8 which were not included in the original
UML patch; these fixes were detected by some warnings, so I probably missed some more
ones.
