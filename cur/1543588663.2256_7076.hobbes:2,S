Both mozilla and aviplay (which are both multithreaded) trigger this - I
haven't tried with xmms. Simpler programs like xclock or cat don't trigger
it.
To answer the question in your other email, I don't have DRI enabled (since
tdfx.o won't load for me due to rwsem fixes - see other thread).
Thanks for your help.
