I figured it would take a little reworking, especially with your recent
MSI changes.  This was just a 'works for me' patch.  Your end_irq() is
cleaner, IMHO.

OK.  Running -51-17 on the Athlon box.  CONFIG_X86_IOAPIC_FAST is still
enabled.  No lockups.  No jack xruns.  Max wakeup-latency is 27us (so far)  
on the debug config.  Nothing out of the ordinary logged except for the
new stack-footprint maximums during boot.
Any need to go back and check -51-16 as well?  Or -51-17 on a non-debug 
config?
