All,
This is the same change I made in my local tree against 2.6.3-bk4. It 
was pretty much a blind change, so I have no idea if it's the right 
thing to do or not, but it certainly compiles now. I've connected a few 
firewire devices and they appear to work as expected without anything 
going belly-up, so it's good enought for me. I guess only Bob really 
knows if that's what he meant.
I'm not subscribed to the list, reply to me personally, etc etc etc.
