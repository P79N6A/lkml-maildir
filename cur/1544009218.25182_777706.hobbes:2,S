It appears to be implemented in the 900 and 901 BIOSes as well, so some 
kind of limitation is probably needed. The best approach would probably 
to check whether the CPU has the EST flag. Just do something like:
struct cpuinfo_x86 *cpu = &cpu_data(policy->cpu);
if (cpu->x86_vendor != X86_VENDOR_INTEL || cpu_has(cpu, X86_FEATURE_EST))
	return -ENODEV
at the top of the cpufreq init code. That way you'll refuse to bind on 
anything that implements speedstep and acpi-cpufreq can be used instead.

My only concern about this is that implementing it via cpufreq means 
that on most distributions you'll end up with ondamend running the CPU. 
This makes sense on systems where the cpu scaling drops the voltage, but 
that isn't the case here as far as I can tell. This may result in some 
workloads now having lower battery lives than they did previously. I'll 
try to do some experimentation next week.
Other than that, this patch looks good. I think it makes sense to 
integrate it into eeepc-laptop.
