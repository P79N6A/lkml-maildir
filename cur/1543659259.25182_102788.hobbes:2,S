Actually, it's one of the few books I actually still own (the perl
one)..  Laziness is indeed a virtue..  One I live my life by.  Of
course, that's why I haven't gotten off my ass all day and have been
doing nothing but reading/writing mails from this list.  :-0  If the
list accepted binaries, I'd take a photo of my room and workspace, and
you'd get the impression that I was one of the laziest people you've
ever met.  Granted, one of my computer science professors (not one of
the greatest professors I ever had) said that the best programmers in
the world are the laziest sons of bitches you'll ever meet, and I think
I may qualify (as a lazy son of a bitch, not necessarily as a great
programmer).
Aww.. Heck.. Go ahead and use goto all you want.  I'm not in a position
to stop anyone anyway.
