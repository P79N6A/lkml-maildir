put in another way: i'd like to see the "TCP bytes transferred per CPU 
time spent by the TCP stack" ratio to be maximized in a load-independent 
way (part of which is the sender host too: to not cause unnecessary 
retransmits is important as well). In a high-load scenario this means 
that any measure that purely improves TCP throughput by giving it more 
cycles is not a real improvement. So the focus should be on throttling 
intelligently and without causing extra work on the sender side either - 
not on trying to circumvent throttling measures.
