Man, I'm just chock *full* o'problems this week, aren't I?
Under 2.6.0-test5, loading NVIDIA proprietary driver (patched with the
stuff at 
http://www.minion.de/nvidia.html
) reports:
Sep 11 23:37:57 nausicaa kernel: 0: nvidia: Can't find an IRQ for your NVIDIA card!
Sep 11 23:37:57 nausicaa kernel: 0: nvidia: Please check your BIOS settings.
Sep 11 23:37:57 nausicaa kernel: 0: nvidia: [Plug & Play OS   ] should be set to NO
Sep 11 23:37:57 nausicaa kernel: 0: nvidia: [Assign IRQ to VGA] should be set to YES
Same driver source does not have this effect under test4, with
approximately the same config (i.e., make oldconfig).
Yeah, I cleaned everything appropriately and rebuilt for test5.  Bzzt.
(FWIW, I do not have the referenced options in my BIOS, but I strongly
suspect that isn't the problem, anyway.)
Cheers,
Kyle
