True.

Yes, and because it also accurately tells you which memory location is bad.
(This can't be easily done from user space, I gather). You can use this
information to workaround the memory problem with the BadRam patch from Rick
Van Rein.

True.

Actually lilo is just about enough for a such menu system...
Something like
image = /boot/memtest86
        label = memtest86
image = /boot/vmlinux
        label = cpuburn
        root = /dev/hda2
        append = "init=/usr/local/bin/burnP6"
        read-only
image = /boot/vmlinux
        label = cpuburn
        root = /dev/hda2
        append = "init=/usr/local/bin/testDMA"
        read-only
It would take some scripting to alternate the tests automatically, but
perhaps it could be done.

AFAIK it's a pretty complete test suite VA uses (used?) for testing their
hw. I'm not sure, though.
