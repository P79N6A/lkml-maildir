It's a mistake, but a harmless one. The scheduler turns off interrupts
soon itself and the instructions it executes before that don't care.
The only reason it's not recommended to call schedule with interrupts
off is that the scheduler will turn them on again, usually breaking
your critical section. In this case it's ok because the next
instrution is a cli again.
