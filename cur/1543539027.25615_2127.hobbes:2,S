The current c9x standard 8actually, the last draft) says this:
       [#2]  The  fclose  function  causes the stream pointed to by
       stream to be flushed and the associated file to  be  closed.
       Any  unwritten buffered data for the stream are delivered to
       the host environment to be written to the file;  any  unread
       buffered  data  are  discarded.  The stream is disassociated
       from the file.  If the associated buffer  was  automatically
       allocated, it is deallocated.
Everything else (including passing in anthing that is not a stream) causes
undefined behaviour, in our case segfaults (most of the time).
As a sidenote, neither manpages nor the libc documentation define how
C works, the ISO C standard does, and POSIX, X/Open & friends add more
functionality.
Interestingly, unix/98 says this:
The fclose() function will fail if: 
EBADF]
        The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid. 
Which is not the case in any examples so far (so the linux manpage is
confusing when it says "stream" instead of "file descriptor").
One could argue that the "solaris standard" says that "in 99% of the
cases, EBADF is returned, otherwise we just segfault" and the GNU standard
says "if you pass anything else in, it's undefined behaviour".
