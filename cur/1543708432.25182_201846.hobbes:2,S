I am still trying to get the terms down.
Could this message be caused by an interrupt driven routine calling schedule() ?
Is schedule the command used to allow another task to interrupt the current routine?
I am moving 2.4 code with task queues to 2.6 with workqueues. I
see this error but want to make sure I understand why it exist
before starting to code around.
