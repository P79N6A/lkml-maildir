has anybody try to use the priority queues of the dp83820?
or does somebody know where to get docu knewer then the 
preliminary form february 2001?
i wrote a driver for the dp83820. now i tried to use 
priority queuing for prescheduled zero copy datastreans.
first i just whanted enable priority queueing without 
inserting of any vlan tag. this works for 1 to 3 queues 
like it sais in the docu (untagged packets are queued 
like packets with priority 0). but when i enable the 4th
queue i receive all none tagged data on queue 1 instead 
of queue 0. and if i enalbe vlan-tagging globaly or on 
a per packet basis i don't get any interrupts on the 
receiving side. has anybody an idea whats going on. if 
you need the code to have a lock at - let me know, i 
realy need some help.
