Typically, a desktop will have the default icons controlled by the  
application. And most users don't even try to change that, and most of the  
rest only change it for a very small number of files.
This is certainly true for both MacOS and Windows. Hell, most versions of  
MacOS didn't even have a mechanism for users to override the default  
icons!

That's because most people discussing this are users, not programmers, of  
the existing desktops that do this.
Just for some examples of what I've seen done under MacOS ...
* saving cursor position, tags, window sizes and similar stuff with text  
files
* saving the equivalent of ./CVS/* with the extracted files
Icons are actually *not* usually stored with anything but applications,  
and not usually changed either.
