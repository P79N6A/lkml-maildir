Yep, but that's not an issue, since all the various device-naming
schemes are supposed to be fixing this. Its a distinct problem;
it needs to be solved even across cold-boots. 
(Didn't I ever tell you about the day I added a new disk controller to
my system, and /dev/hda became /dev/hde and thus /home was mounted on
/usr and /var as /etc and all hell broke loose? Owww, device naming
is a serious issue for home users and even more so for enterprise-class 
users).
