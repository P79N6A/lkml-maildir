Well, a better solution would be a userspace free of /proc/ dependency.
Or actually fixing the kernel. proc_pid_readdir() wants an efficiently
indexable linear list, e.g. TAOCP's 6.2.3 "Linear List Representation".
At that point its expense is proportional to the buffer size and
"seeking" about the list as it is wont to do is O(lg(processes)).
