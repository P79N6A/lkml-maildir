OK.  find_lock_page() has the splice stuff in it.

Is OK, I updated it.
I'm not sure that the `goto repeat' is needed if truncate got there first,
really - if truncate took the page down then it's now outside i_size and
shouldn't be coming back.
If the page _can_ come back then this code is all rather problematic. 
Because this means that the page can come back (via an extending write())
one nanosecond after ufs_get_locked_page() returns NULL.  Won't the callers
of ufs_get_locked_page() get confused by that?
