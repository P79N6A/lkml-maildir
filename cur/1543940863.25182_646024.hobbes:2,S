Yes, and it will increase of the same amount of RAM that you pretend
everyone to pay even if MMU_NOTIFIER=n after your patch is applied (vs
mine that generated 0 ram utilization increase when
MMU_NOTIFIER=n). And the additional ram will provide not just
self-contained locking but higher scalability too.
I think it's much more important to generate zero ram and CPU overhead
for the embedded (this is something I was very careful to enforce in
all my patches), than to reduce scalability and not having a self
contained locking on full configurations with MMU_NOTIFIER=y.

KVM sure doesn't need any locking there.  I thought somebody had to
possibly take a pin on the "mm_count" and pretend to call
mmu_notifier_register at will until mmdrop was finally called, in a
out of order fashion given mmu_notifier_release was implemented like
if the list could change from under it. Note mmdrop != mmput. mmput
and in turn mm_users is the serialization point if you prefer to drop
all locking from _release. Nobody must ever attempt a mmu_notifier_*
after calling mmput for that mm. That should be enough to be
safe. I'm fine either ways...
