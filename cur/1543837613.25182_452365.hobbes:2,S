Yeah, it will deadlock if the lock is already taken before calling
__kfifo_get and __kfifo_put.

What I had in mind is to replace all occurences of:
	kfifo_alloc(..., NULL);
	...
	spin_lock(&session->lock)
	__kfifo_get()
	spin_unlock()
with the simpler:
	kfifo_alloc(..., &session->lock)
	...
	kfifo_get()
As for the occurences of:
	...
	spin_lock(&session->lock)
	do_something();
	__kifo_get();
well, there is not much we can do about them...
Let's take this problem differently: is a memory barrier cheaper than a
spinlock ? 
If the answer is yes as I suspect, why should the kfifo API force the
user to take a spinlock ?
