The i386 lock is already exported in i8253.h

Sounds ugly, but that's not material for now and cannot be applied to
older kernels, which need this fix as well.
BTW, there are more creative PIT users in drivers/input which use the
global lock already, but the PIT usage there is definitely broken on
anything >= 2.6.21.
