Right. But the point is that most drivers will do something like
	if (!dev->irq)
		return;
(whatever, made up). And that having NO_IRQ be anything but 0 is thus 
fundamentally broken.
Because the fact is, NO_IRQ _is_ zero. And exactly because it's zero, and 
that is encoded everywhere, nobody uses it.

I'm NOT talking about PCI specs.
I'm talking about real hardware.
Read pretty much _any_ data-sheet for an interrupt router, and you'll see 
that the bit pattern 0000 means _disabled_. 
In other words, I'm talking about HARD REALITY.
I know, it's a bitch.
