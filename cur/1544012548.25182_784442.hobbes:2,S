Really?  I don't see that in the documentation anywhere (except as an
aside in a comment you added to inotify's pin-to-kill method).  Nor do
I find it supported by code review.  Sure, the queue is limited size,
but you are guaranteed an overflow event when messages are dropped;
that's all that's needed for reliability.  Can you provide some
specific example where events are lost "by design"?  There are
userland races in inotify, but they are all solvable, and I've
described above how to do so.  The problem is that the workarounds
make practical programming with inotify very cumbersome, and the
result is that most implementors haven't bothered to make things
correct (ie, moving a directory breaks all search tools I've looked
at).  I'm interested in determining whether there are minor tweaks
which can make correct userlands easier to write.  That's why I've
been beating the "autoadd" drum in this thread: it's a very small
patch would would remove one category of race entirely (leaving only
the rename races for userland to deal with).

You seem to be confusing inotify watch descriptors with file
descriptors.  Directories are not held open in inotify, as you should
know.
Adding an inotify_open_wd() syscall would indeed eliminate the last of
the 3 races I described above (a/b/c rename to a/d/c).  It wouldn't do
anything about a/b -> a/c rename races.

Sure.  Because not all filesystems support xattr (say) we should
refuse to add it to any?  As you know well, The standard solution to
the inode problem (in NFS or FUSE, say) is to synthesize stable inode
numbers in the kernel (or in metadata in something like vfat), with
the understanding that these numbers will be different on every mount.
 For the purposes of race-avoidance in inotify, transient inode
numbers are acceptable.  And we can always fall back to "old racy
inotify" or manual filesystem scans for minority filesystems.

You didn't comment on this alternative, but as I've continued thinking
about the problem, this alternative has seemed best.

The high level problem should be obvious, but I'll restate it for you anyway:
  * Maintain a auxiliary set of content-derived metadata for each file
in some subset (under a directory, mount-point, matching a wildcard,
etc).  This metadata must be updated whenever the content changes, and
must include/maintain some stable reference to the file so that
searches on the metadata can be mapped back to their corresponding
files later.
Implementors vary on the definition of 'content' (do file permissions
count? xattrs? etc),  the best "update" API (is notify-on-close and
reindexing entire files sufficient, or do we want to do incremental
updates on each dirty block/byte), and whether the notification is
synchronous or asynchronous (eg: Eric Paris wants to act on 'bad'
content, so he needs a synchronous interface to prevent races from
acting on bad content).  In Linux search tools I've looked at, the
'stable reference' notion has usually been kept as a file:// URL (ie,
absolute path), but Mac OS X has file handles closer to inode numbers
(although I'm not positive that's what they are using).
Filesystem-agnostic tools are preferable, but "works best on
filesystem X" search tools are already common.  The BeFS was an
example of non-agnostic search, and Beagle "works best" on filesystems
that support xattrs.  The i_version field will also be useful for
search tools, for filesystems which support it (only ext4 so far?).
So give me filesystem-specific search if it is compelling, or agnostic
search where possible.

So, you don't understand the problem, and you'd rather not have
inotify in tree because you think it is "blatantly inadequate" -- yet
you are using inotify in your audit subsystem?  I think I am beginning
to get the impression that you're just not going to be much help.

I don't think this is a sound technical argument.  We've got at least
two different APIs on the table (fanotify and inotify), a
well-understood problem description, *and* I've made at least 4
different proposals for how the current situation might be improved.
Please feel free to suggest concrete alternatives, but I don't plan to
continue this thread while you are just taking bogus potshots.
