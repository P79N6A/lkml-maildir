Rafael> Did you enabled the: CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y ???
No, I have CONFIG_FB is not set, so that option doesn't show up.
I do prefer to not use the FB on this box; I've had some bad
interactions between (radeonfb or vesafb) and X.
Rafael> try to enable it.
I will give a test w/ a fb, just to confirm whether that matters.
