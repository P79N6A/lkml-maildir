Well, In the past yar and a half I've been asked for it twice.  Granted thats
not alot of demand, but neither is the code particularly invasive or complex.
If your concerned about bloat, my first thought would be to add a compile time
config option, which I'm certainly willing to add if the consensus is to do so,
but honestly I thought this was small enough that it didnt' really need it.
As previously mentioned though, the final say as to what is important enough to
make it into the kernel is up to you and Linus.  I think this is worthwhile, but
if I'm in the minority on that, I'll certainly understand
Thanks & Regards
Neil
