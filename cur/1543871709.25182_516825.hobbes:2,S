What's the rule to read/write number_of_cpusets? The earlier cpuset code was
incrementing/decrementing under callback_mutex, but now we aren't. How safe is 
that? 
The earlier cpuset code also was reading number_of_cpusets w/o the
callback_mutex held (atleast in cpuset_zone_allowed_softwall). Is that safe?
