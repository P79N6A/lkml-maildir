No, the uhci-hcd driver isn't stepping on any extraneous ISA I/O ports.
Walt's problem was the result of a buggy BIOS, and turning off legacy USB 
support in the BIOS fixed it.  Maybe your problem is similar, though it's 
hard to imagine how.
I've got 3 computers with UHCI controllers.  On none of them does a USB 
event cause the floppy disk drive to do anything.
