I think that logic is reversed here, I guess it should be: enable barrier
if user enables wcache and disable it if user disables wcache.

This is not true because there is a check for flush cache in write_cache().
I agree that disabling write cache by default is a good thing but user
should be informed about this fact (ideally there also should be easily
available FAQ somewhere) otherwise we will get a lot of bogus bugreports
about decreased performance...

I'll drop this chunk and resend to Linus.
Thanks!
