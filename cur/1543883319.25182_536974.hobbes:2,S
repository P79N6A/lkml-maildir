I agree that merging some framework is a good way to proceed.

In my experience, rbtrees are painfully slow. Yesterday, I spent the
day replacing them in haproxy with other trees I developped a few
years ago, which look like radix trees. They are about 2-3 times as
fast to insert 64-bit data, and you walk through them in O(1). I have
many changes to apply to them before they could be used in kernel, but
at least I think we already have code available for other types of trees.

good luck !
