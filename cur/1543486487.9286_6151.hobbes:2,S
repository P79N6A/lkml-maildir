   and I was compiling with SuSE Linux 6.0 on a Pentium-100. The message 
   from the linker was:
   kernel/kernel.o: In function `update_wall_time':
   kernel/kernel.o(.text+0x832c): undefined reference to `__divdi3'
The error here has nothing  in particular to do with suse, so I would
not bother them further, it will happen on any non-64bit architecture
on which you try to add long long division in the kernel. :-)
This undefined symbol is in libgcc, until you added your code which
divided a long long, it isn't necessary to link in libgcc to the
kernel so it simply is not done and never has.
I would suggest open coding your larger precision division using other
integer types or finding some other way to avoid this issue.  I doubt
Linus will allow adding "-lgcc" to the kernel build....
