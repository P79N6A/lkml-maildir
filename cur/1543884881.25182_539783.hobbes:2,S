if I understood your idea right, then in data=ordered mode, commit thread writes
all dirty mapped blocks before real commit.
say, we have two threads: t1 is a thread doing flushing and t2 is a commit thread
t1					t2
find dirty inode I
find some dirty unallocated blocks
journal_start()
allocate blocks
attach them to I
journal_stop()
					going to commit
					find inode I dirty
					do NOT find these blocks because they're
					  allocated only, but pages/bhs aren't mapped
					  to them
					start commit
map pages/bhs to just allocate blocks
so, either we mark pages/bhs someway within journal_start()--journal_stop() or
commit thread should do lookup for all dirty pages. the latter doesn't sound nice, IMHO.
thanks, Alex
