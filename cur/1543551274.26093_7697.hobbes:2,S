Two times no.
First: This breaks backward-compatibility.
Second: I don't know much of the block device handling
	in Linux, but what you produced seems like a quick
	shot. I can see this e.g. at the point where you
	declare 'sector' to be 'int' (7th hunk), whereas in
	include/linux/blkdev.h request.sector is declared
	_unsigned_ int.
	  I don't know what request.sector is for loop
	devices (The block number of the underlying
	filesystem, if any? The hard sector number of the
	underlying blockdevice? Always the 512-byte-blocks
	number?), but if it is not the latter, i.e. always
	"position >> 9", you have just shifted the issue
	from one level (the fs block size) to another
	(whatever units sector is in).
The better solution (for 2.2. and 2.4; in 2.5 Andries Brouwer has
something more clean in his mind, IIUHC) is to add a new field to struct
loop_info to indicate the encryption chunk size and patch losetup/mount
to set this to 512 by default and to the filesystem block size if asked
to by some command line switch. This allows people to convert their
stuff.
You may want to join linux-crypto@nl.linux.org (majordomo) if you want
to work on this.
