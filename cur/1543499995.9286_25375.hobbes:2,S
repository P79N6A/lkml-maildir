   Small outgoing packets to the pop3 server or to smtp servers seem
   to work fine though -- it looks like the TCP stack is only able to
   do one thing at a time and it processes stuff in LIFO order (or in
   this case, FINO).
Are you trying to do bulk transfers and "choppy" connections at the
same time?  This is where PPP tends to break down, and one suggested
workaround is to explicitly set your tx queue length to some small
value at ifconfig up time (say "4"), this makes congestion control
kick in much faster in these kinds of connection loads.  You will then
see that load is spread out more evenly and connections make equal
progress.
