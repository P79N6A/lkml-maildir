On 2.6.23-git1, if "MMC/SD card support" is selected, and LED driver support is not selected in the
configuration, the following build errors occur:
drivers/mmc/core/host.c: In function ‘mmc_remove_host’:
drivers/mmc/core/host.c:146: error: implicit declaration of function ‘led_trigger_unregister’
drivers/mmc/core/host.c:146: error: ‘struct mmc_host’ has no member named ‘led’
My architecture is x86_64, but I don't think that makes a difference.
