As I mentioned, no_timer_check doesn't fix it for me.  In fact it makes 
the problem significantly worse.  I tried it again just to be sure.  Also 
I tried noapic again and it doesn't help either.
I found there was an upgrade to the NVIDIA graphics driver that addressed 
a clock issue (I don't know if it's related to my problem).  I upgraded 
from version 7667 to 7676.  That seemed to help a little bit, at least in 
prolonging the amount of time I could reasonably use the system.  Someone 
in another thread mentioned that they thought this problem might be caused 
by something in x.org, which I am using.
Any other ideas or patches would be much appreciated.
thanks for your help,
Nathan
