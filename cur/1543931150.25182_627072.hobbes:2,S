sometimes ACPI is involved and will killswitch the Bluetooth device on
suspend. Sometimes the distros to a manual killswitch. And in case of
Bluetooth a killswitch means physically removing the power from the
device.
In case of a MacBook it can happen that this device goes back into HID
mode and thus you need to call hid2hci.
