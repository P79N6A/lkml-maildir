    Heaven forbid should anybody express an oppossing viewpoint!
This is starting to feel like the boys at M$.

     I'm afraid I don't share your viewpoint here, but you know it's less of
an issue for me because it's well maintained and easy to apply, so it's not a
big deal to apply for each new release.
     The low-latency patch is more difficult, it won't apply as is for Sparc,
so I have to hand remove portions for every new release which is a PITA.
     But it's become abundantly clear that neither security nor latency are
important issues to the vast majority here.  Nor is stability on any platform
other than Intel.  I give up.  Have a nice life.
