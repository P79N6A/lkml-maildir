Fair enough. Just make sure you handle the big problem case (kmap only
maps a single page, not the entire sg entry).

They tell the page fault handler that it may not sleep on a page fault.
Currently it only has the behaviour of disabling preemption though. I'd
guess it is present for non-highmem so that things behave somewhat
