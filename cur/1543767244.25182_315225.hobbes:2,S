Sent in a different message. This patch does not restrict 
usage of SCSI_IOCTL_START_UNIT and SCSI_IOCTL_STOP_UNIT. For tapes, those 
mean load and unload commands. The drive status changes resulting from 
these commands seem to be caught by st otherwise. I will do a patch for 
-12rc later today or tomorrow. It may add changing some st status bits if 
these commands succeed but that is not -stable material.
Thanks for the review for all participants.
