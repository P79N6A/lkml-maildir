Just to make an example hw_resend_irq will be certainly need by the
generic part of the kernel. Having a way to cleanly include architectural
code is good IMHO. Such file it's just like asm/pgtable.h.
If you want to put the very very alpha stuff in irq_impl.h that's not
wrong, but moving things like hw_resend_irq outside include/asm-alpha/ is
certainly wrong and that won't happen here.
