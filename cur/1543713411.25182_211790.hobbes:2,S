this got high prio to release due the prio-tree fixes from Rajesh, not
that I ever triggered those bugs but they could hurt in theory. I feel
things will settle down on the VM side from now on (at least in the
objrmap/prio-tree/anon-vma area ;).
I tried giving a spin to the 2.6.5-mc1.bz2 patch from Andrew but it
apparently rejects heavily against 2.6.5.
