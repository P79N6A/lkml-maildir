Hi,
I'm the student working on this. I have already implemented tracing for
SLAB, SLUB and SLOB, and patched relayfs to work early on (just after
kmem_cache_init() runs). Currently, I'm working on the userspace tool,
so much of the coding is largely finished.
I wanted to submit the relay stuff, but couldn't contact its maintainer.
If anyone wants to take a look, I could set up a git repo somewhere
(which has to be done anyway, at some point).
	Cheers,
	Eduard
