I don't think that "unsigned long" is the correct data type.
Isn't there a data type that means "the largest unsigned integer type
that fits into a register on the target..."? I was told that that's what
"size_t" means. If so, all the flags variables <everywhere> should be
changed to this type. If not, then somebody should define a "flags_t"
type. With the new 64-bit machines, this is going to bite over and
over again until something like this is done.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
