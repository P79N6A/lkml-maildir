This sounds like autofs - you'd just need a program to scan all 
available removable block devices, and look for a "label" to ID the 
media - either a (V)FAT label, or an EXT(23) label, or XFS label, or....
Then you mount the named volume as needed, with a 10 second umount 
timeout, so that you can remove it easily.
No need to add stuff to the kernel, it's already there.
