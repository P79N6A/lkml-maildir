The PCI IDE code and legacy IDE code both find the device and they
realise its the same device so that it is driven by a suitable driver.
The legacy IDE driver is useful if your platform has an unsupported IDE
controller. It seems ot me the correct fix for IA64 is probably to set
your arch specific probe address function to only probe the standard PCI
legacy ports and to do any other appropriate checks, not to take an axe
to Kconfig.
