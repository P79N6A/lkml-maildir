This has new platform support, new drivers, and so on. None of which is
suitable outside of -rc1-2. You are aware of this thing called the merge

Try splitting out the critical bugfixes in to a different tree and have
that pulled for the next -rc, if you expect to get any of the fixes
merged for 2.6.22.
