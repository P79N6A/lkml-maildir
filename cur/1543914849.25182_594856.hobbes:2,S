Ok, opened up: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9026
and brought it up to date with the discussion and David's comments on this
thread. Timo, please feel free to revisit this later and update us when you find
the time to do so.
[ BTW I think the "add CC:" thing in bugzilla is broken, I was simply unable to
  add David Brownell, linux-acpi@ and Timo to the CC: for that bug, if somebody
  knows how to do this, please add them ... ]
Thanks,
Satyam
