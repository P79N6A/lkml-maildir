Folks,
The above patch for scheduler cache affinity improvement in 2.4 kernels by
Ingo Molnar was applied to 2.4.14 kernel;
a run of Volano LoopBack BenchMark on a Netfinity 8500 R 1MB 700 MHz PIII
1MB-L2 cache and 1GB memory support produced
the following results:
     The UniProcessor throughput  was reduced by 40%.
     The 4-way throughput showed a very slight degradation of 1%.
     The 8-way throughput showed an improvemnet of 10%.
I do not subscribe to lkml and hence please address any future
correspondence on this topic to partha@us.ibm.,com.
Thanks,
Partha
