I have a better idea (This may be sarcasm but maybe not).  Why don't we just
rip out all ide and scsi subsystems and make one general layer that both
physical ide and scsi systems share?
NOTE: I do not have any dealings with the code aspect of IDE and SCSI so I
don't know what would be involed (I don't see it happening anyway).
I've never been a fan of IDE, I dislike it completely.  I'd prefer to simply
buy an ide-scsi hardware converter and make all my drives scsi.  But that's
just me =)
I did find it funny that an IDE drive in a USB box is a SCSI drive under
linux.
Send flames to /dev/null not to the list, I don't want a flame war over
this.  I will not respond to any flames.
