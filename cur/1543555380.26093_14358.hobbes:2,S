Its got nothing to do with the ANSI-ness of the compiler, but more to do
with the C startup code - does the C startup code initialise BSS to zero
or does it not?
In this particular example, we have full control over it; in the kernel
has our own start up code which does initialise the BSS to zero.
In the dim and distant past (about 7-8 years ago), it was true that we
didn't init the BSS and everything had to be initialised, but this is
long gone.
