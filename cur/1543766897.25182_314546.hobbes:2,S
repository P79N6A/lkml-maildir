I think you point out a solution could be worse that what it cures. 
There are clearly problems with mount over, but imagine that a user does 
an invisible mount over /mnt, doesn't that prevent other mounts which 
are usually made, like /mnt/cdrom, /mnt/loopN, etc?
Every time someone suggests a solution it seems to open a new path to 
possible abuse. And features which only work with a monotonic kernel 
rather than modules would seem to indicate that the feature is nice but 
the implementation might benefit from more thinking time.
Frankly the whole statement that the controversial code MUST go in now 
and could be removed later sounds like a salesman telling me I MUST sign 
the contract today, but he will let me out of it if I decide it was a 
mistake.
I'm not against the feature, but a lot of people I consider competent 
seem to find the implementation controversial, which argues for waiting 
until more eyes are on the code. If the rest of the code is useless 
without the controversial part, maybe it should all stay a patch to use 
or not as people decide.
