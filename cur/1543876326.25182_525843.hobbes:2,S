My experience with kswapd eating a lot of CPU tells that this particular 
problem with Linux 2.4 manifests itself on this scenario:
 * No swap is configured (we are blessed with RAM).
_AND_:
 * A lot of memory is allocated (for my case: a lot of anonymous pages 
used for applications).
Looking at this problem with kdb, I noticed that the CPU spends a lot 
of time in swap_out(), even though there are no swap devices...
So...
mm/vmscan.c, replace swap_out with this:
    static int swap_out(zone_t * classzone)
    {
            return 0;
    }
Now, this might raise some eyebrows for those MM gurus reading this
mail but I assure you I've been doing this for a lot of time (and 
a lot of machines) on 2.4.27, and it took care of my kswapd issues
quite nicely.
I hope it helps...
