After I sent the message I see what was bothering me. Actually the code in
vgacon is correct and their is a bug in vga16fb with its own version of
vga_vesa_blank. I was actually looking at vga16fb instead of vgacon. My
mistake especially since both codes are som much alike. In vga_vesa_blank
in vga16fb you have:
cli();
Seq...
Crt...
/* save orginal ...
if (!info->vesa_blanked) {
    ...
    cli();	 	
Where it should be as in vgacon.c:
vga_vesa_blank(..)
{
	
  if (!info->vesa_blanked) {
	cli();
	Seq...
 	Crt...
	sti();
	
	....
}
