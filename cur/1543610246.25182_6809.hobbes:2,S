include/linux/skbuff.h has a big fat comment describing checksums handling.
Just read it.
For RX checksums you just set ip_summed of the incoming skb 
to CHECKSUM_UNNCESSARY (you did a complete check of the checksum;
not recommended as you're unlikely to support all weird protocols) or 
CHECKSUM_HW (you put a checksum of the TCP/UDP data area minus pseudo header
and ip header into skb->csum) or CHECKSUM_NONE for sw checksum.
