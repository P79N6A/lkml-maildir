	You seem to have a misconception about what sched_yield is for. It is not a 
replacement for blocking or a scheduling priority adjustment. It simply lets 
other ready-to-run tasks be scheduled before returning to the current task.
	Here's a quote from SuS3:
"The sched_yield() function shall force the running thread to relinquish the 
processor until it again becomes the head of its thread list. It takes no 
arguments."
	This neither says nor implies anything about CPU usage. It simply says that 
the current thread will yield and be put at the end of the list.
