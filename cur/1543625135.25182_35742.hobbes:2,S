	Will you accept the testing of a gal? ;)

	Here are the dbench throughput results on an 8-way SMP with 2GB memory.
These are run with 64 then 128 clients 15 times each averaged. It looked 
pretty good.
	Running with more than 180 clients caused the system to hang, after 
a reset there was much filesystem corruption. This happened twice. Probably
related to filling up disk space. There are no ServerRaid drivers for 2.5 yet 
so the biggest disks on this system are unusable. lockmeter results are forthcoming (day or two). 
Running dbench on an 8-way SMP 15 times each.
2.5.6 clean
Clients		Avg
64		37.9821
128		29.8258
2.5.6 with everything.patch
Clients		Avg
64		41.0204
128		30.6431
