Ha! The first time around this vfork manpage only got
smiling agreement and one comment on `broken' in the header.
But now Albert D. Cahalan awoke and started ranting about politics..
Let me only answer your concrete questions.
: .. does your software support v6 UNIX?
Yes. I wrote large parts of my software under v6 UNIX.
It works on all Unix flavors. Such a pleasure.
: No, but there are gaping holes in the documentation. I'd most like
: to know what I can get from the raw system call, libc 5, recent glibc,
: and older glibc. For example, are file descriptors handled well?
The page says that vfork is just like fork.

    Do you _know_ this? Off the top of my head I'd say the original process
    will suffer minor page faults after the exec.
You can read this in the fork manpage. If you disagree, submit
a patch to the fork manpage.

    Since the POSIX version is so useless, you can just consider vfork() to
    be a Linux-specific call. On a modern Linux system, one may depend on
    quite a few things.
Of course. But the posting by Reed H. Petty you reacted to
gave among the reasons for the introduction of this system call
standard compliance, portability and the like.
The present page stresses that it may be unwise to think
these are good reasons. Of course, as soon as you no longer
connect the BSD vfork with the Linux vfork then Linux got
a private system call (of which nobody so far has shown the use,
but which might be useful in special circumstances).
