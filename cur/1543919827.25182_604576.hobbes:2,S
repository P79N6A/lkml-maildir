This is supplying data for a system call not something for internal use 
by the class.  As far as the sched_fair class is concerned this is just 
a (necessary - because it's need by a system call) diversion.

sched_fair doesn't care so if nothing else does why do we even have 
sys_sched_rr_get_interval()?  Is this whole function an anachronism that 
can be expunged?  I'm assuming that the reason it exists is that there 
are user space programs that use this system call.  Am I correct in this 
assumption?  Personally, I can't think of anything it would be useful 
for other than satisfying curiosity.
