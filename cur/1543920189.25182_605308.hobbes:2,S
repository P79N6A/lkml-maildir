Yes, I agree with you now, although I have a little concern about the
possibility of big delay introduced by workqueue.

I am not sure here, should do some investigate of the hardware datasheet.

Yes, it should be move to ad7142_detach_client()

Yes, no need input_unregister_device() here.
Thanks a lot for you kindly review.
I will resend update patch later.
