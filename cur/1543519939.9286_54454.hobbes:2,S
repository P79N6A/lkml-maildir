I have solid lockups on SMP kernels (but just having a single processor)
Lockups seem to happen when i have a lot of X activity.
I have a feeling its the new timer code related. Because when we at the
University of Kansas added the utime patch to any kernel with the fast
timer code in it then the hang up is accelerated. The hangups did not
happen with the old timer code
