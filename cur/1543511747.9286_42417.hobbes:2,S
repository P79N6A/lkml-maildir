Why contact a daemon? Have modprobe run 'MAKEDEV' when it's done.  MAKEDEV
can already read /proc/devices to automagically figure out many devices to
configure.  It's also mentioned in the man-page to have autodelete support
but I imagine that it doesn't right now since it is missing a comprehensive
list of nodes that should exist.

MAKDEV.

Don't run MAKEDEV.

No kernel modification.

Maybe, but not currently.  If it was exported by kernel in /proc, yes.
Currently only the majors are.

Believe so but fuzzy on the intent behind the above.

No need.  /dev on a ramdisk.  Run 'MAKEDEV update' when you boot.
