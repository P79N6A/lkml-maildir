I thought there was some semantic differences between select() and 
pselect()... perhaps those changes have been removed?

There is a school of thought that it's useful to reserve a system call 
number (usually zero) as a system call that is *guaranteed* to have no 
effect.

Btw, please implement rt_sigreturn sanely; on x86, for example, one has 
to pop a word off the stack before one can invoke the system call, when 
used as sa_restorer...
