This confirms our observation with PowerPC MPC5200 boards (running at
400 MHz). Without networking, the worst case latency measured with
cyclictest does not exceed 100 us. With networking, and especially with
the NFS file-system, latencies go up to 170 us. I also measured external
interrupt latencies with an external log system using GPIO pins but was
unable to achieve latencies below 1ms. This needs more debugging.
