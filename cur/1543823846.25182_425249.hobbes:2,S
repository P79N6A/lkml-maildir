This place is actually the only one where we don't want to use msleep.
This function (myri10ge_send_cmd) might be called from various context
(spinlocked or not) and pass orders to the NIC whose processing time
depends a lot on the command. Of course, we don't have any place where a
long operation is passed from a spinlocked context :) But, we need the
tiny udelay granularity for the spinlocked case, and the long loop for
operations that are long to process in the NIC.
Concerning all the other places where you suggested to use msleep, you
were right.

As Roland pointed out, there was too many volatile in this code. We are
reworking this together with the sparse annotations.

When are we supposed to call dev_printk or not in such a driver ?

That's what I thought but i was told that the fashion these days is to
keep the IDs with the driver that uses them. I'll happy to move as long
as everybody agrees :)
Thanks a lot for all your comments,
