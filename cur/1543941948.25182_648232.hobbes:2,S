So where in this would you put the
	pcibios_init() -> pcibios_resource_survey()
call (it's a subsys_initcall)?
THAT is the thing that actually registers the PCI resurces we've found 
into the resource tree!
It's very inconveniently placed as-is, since it literally depends on the 
whole initcall ordering (and the link order within that subsys_initcall 
thing), and all of this is architecture-driven rather than driven from 
some central place.
So this is the thing that I think should happen before any PnP or ACPI 
drivers actually start registerign themselves (but obviously needs to 
happen after the PCI buses have been enumerated).
The ACPI/PnP tables shouldn't be able to break the enumeration of the 
actual hardware devices, now should it?

We should enumerate the PCI devices, then register their resources (and 
no, I'm not at *all* convinced it should happen as a separate 
subsys_initcall), and then register the PnP resources. 
So I think we should have roughly something like:
 - arch_initcall: this could enumerate the ACPI/PnP devices (but not 
   register anything). Alternatively, do it as subsys_initcall, and just
   make sure it happens early with link-order.
 - subsys_initcall: this should do that pcibios_init() thing that surveys 
   the resources (and the PCI enumeration needs to have happened before, 
   probably in the same initcall thanks to link order)
 - PnP/ACPI resource allocation *after* it, but before driver loading 
   (which wll cause new resources to be allocated). This could be 
   fs_initcall, or whatever (that's what things like "acpi_event_init" 
   already do).
 - regular drivers will come along much later, as part of 
   driver_initcall, and by the time this happens, we've now reserved all 
   resources we know about.
Basically, we just want to register the most trust-worthy resources before 
we register anything less trust-worthy. And actual device probing simply 
tends to be more trust-worthy than any randomly broken ACPI/PnP tables.
