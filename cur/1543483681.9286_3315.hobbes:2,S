I am using version 2.2.1 I don't get errors on startup even though
I 'ifconfig' and 'route' as usual.
OLD_PATH=${PATH}
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
hostname chaos
domainname analogic.com
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 broadcast 127.255.255.255
route add -net 127.0.0.0 dev lo metric 0 netmask 255.0.0.0
ifconfig eth0 204.178.40.224 netmask 255.255.248.0 broadcast 204.178.47.255
route add -net 204.178.40.0 dev eth0 metric 0 netmask 255.255.248.0
route add default gw 204.178.40.1 metric 1 dev eth0 netmask 0.0.0.0
PATH=${OLD_PATH}
Newer versions of the kernel need the complete structure filled in.
There are no defaults. Therefore you have to tell ifconfig and route
about everything. Anyway, if you put the right stuff in there, the
kernel does not complain.
Cheers,
