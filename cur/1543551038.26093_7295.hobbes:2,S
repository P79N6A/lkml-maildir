In that case the time the process has been running and the
CPU time used will save the process if it's been running for
a long time.
Please read the /entire/ algorithm before making rash
conclusions like this.
If nice is used for important, long-running tasks, the fact
that they are long-running will save them (and be honest,
would you really care if a simulation would be killed after
5 minutes?  it's only inconvenient if it gets killed after
a few hours...)

This doesn't make ANY sense at all. The objective is to destroy
the least amount of work, which means giving a bonus to processes
which have used a lot of CPU time already ... regardless of nice
value.

If you have a better algorithm, feel free to send patches.
