I thought about that, but soldering irons are scarce here and I don't want
to waste mine. ;)

Are these fast enough for sampling bits from CTS and putting a clock onto
DTR at 100.200 Hz?
Will switching to the data lines (without having any kind of protocol or
stop bits or something) do any good? I can probably convince the hardware
guys to use a different pin on the RS232...

I don't think so. :(
 
Anyway, thanks a lot for answering.  This has to work _somehow_ ...
