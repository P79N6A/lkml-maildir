Let's just consider the case of ordered writes, something we don't do
right now but that we'l do in another few years. You may want to mark
things dirty while holding a spinlock, for example, to guarantee that you
get a cluster of ordered writes..
And as the normal filesystems are all using the common buffer routines
anyway, it's only the special cases tat are hurt by having to explicitly
do te dirty balancing. In fact, I suspect that raiserfs should =really=
try to use the common routines too - it will never beat the standard
filesystems in performance if it doesn't (the old-fashioned way of having
data in both buffer-cache and the page cache not only uses memory, but is
much slower for certain memory-mapped operations).
