Yeah.  Actually, the external device  generates a stream of BYTES, not
bits.  Byte is  the basic unit.  This makes the PS  AUX port look like
an RS/232 port from the OS's perspective.

And   people   can  start   writing   better   (more  features,   with
config. files) userland drivers  for their mouse or non-mouse pointing
devices.    The   drivers  only   need   to   take   the  bytes   from
/dev/misc/isa0060/serio* and/or  /dev/ttyS1, interpret them,  and then
refeed the interpreted  events back to the input  system via 'uinput'.
Maybe, 'gpm' can  be modified to do it.  I can't  see any more reasons
for  writing  those  drivers   in  kernel  (non-swappable,  no  memory
protection, etc.)  space.
BTW, how about USB mice?  Do they export a byte-stream interface?
