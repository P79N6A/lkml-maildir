This makes sense to me. It can be used in kexec bootloader to warn user
if command line size exceeds than supported by kernel.

Today I have posted the x86_64 relocatable kernel patches which also fill
in missing 2.05 fields for x86_64.

I think you will not require more than two bytes to represent supported
command line size so you can use replace pad3 and use these two bytes. These
were anyway padding bytes to be used for other requirements.

This is wrong. CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START is not alignment. On x86_64 alignment
required is 2MB. (0x200000).
