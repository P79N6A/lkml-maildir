Subject: [PATCH] Allow to disable CONFIG_SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=m in menuconfig.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi there!
This was already discussed in May: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/13/75
without any valuable results.
I don't want to have the scsi_wait_scan.ko around but still need
SCSI for usb disks and module support for driver development.
Otherwise, I am working with a monolithic kernel on embedded machines.
The attached patch is another try to at least allow to get
rid of this module.
Feedback is welcome.
Regards,
