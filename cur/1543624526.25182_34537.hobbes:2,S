	Actually, there are many indentation changes between the
NCR drivers in 2.4.18 and 2.5.6, but looking at the changes with
"diff -w" shows very few other changes, just really ancilliary
things like option parsing.
	I was a little surprised to see things like procedure
declaration lines ending in "{", which I understand confuses vi
(or some vi's).  Examples from g_NCR53C80.c include internal_setup,
generic_NCR5380_setup, generic_NCR53C400_setup, and many others.
	I believe the code in 2.5.6 is your new NCR driver,
in spite of the formatting differences.
