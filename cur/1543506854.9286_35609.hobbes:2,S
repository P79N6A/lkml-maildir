Hello,
	Is anyone working on a driver for the 3Com Internal Docsis cable
modem?  I am assuming that it is a device somewhat similar to a NIC, but
haven't dug too deep yet.  Anyway, I have some 3Com people comming
tomorrow and was wondering what questions I should ask them to get moving
in the right direction for Linux support.
	Thanks,
	-Joseph W. Breu
