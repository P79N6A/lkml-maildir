You really ought to get yourself a copy of "Linux Device
Drivers 2nd Edition" by Rubini and Corbet.  
It contains good explanations and lots of examples.

Lucky for you, there is a free online copy:

but you probably want to get the paper version too, it is
more convenient in many situations.
Good luck.
