Thanks for your help. I will make the patch, test it and send it out as
soon as possible to put it into the 2.6.18 cycle.
Thanks,

Sorry, I didn't have time to look at this yet.  scsi_get/put_command()
sems ok for now, if you have time to look at this now it would be good
if you could look at it.  It's too late for 2.6.17 already, but having
it early in the 2.6.18 cycle would be very helpful.
