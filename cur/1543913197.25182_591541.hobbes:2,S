You can get cross compilers and make it compile and I'm sure some
powerpc person will be happy to test it then when you post the patches

At least the variables that are used by non architecture specific code 
(like cpu_sibling_map) should be probably all converted. For architecture
specific variables it's ok to leave it to the architecture people.
