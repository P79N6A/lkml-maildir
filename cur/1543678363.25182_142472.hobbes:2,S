Indeed, I have it compiled in even.
Let me see if hte laptop is turned on currently.
Unfortunately, no.  But anyways, it does the classic error of {your drive}
{shouldn't do this}
and then disables DMA mode, and goes back to working.
It's an HP Omnibook 5700, and it's a Toshiba 1.3 gig drive in there.  I
don't remember if my Omnibook 5500 did it, and it's a pain to take the
donor screen back off the 5700 and putting it on the 5500 to try.
I had to disable "automatically enable DMA" for the laptop not to jam up
for a minute while it figures out the DMA mode isn't going to work.
It doesn't work in windows either for that matter, if I remember right the
option is completely greyed out.  Blacklist on windows?
I will check the exact lspci and hdparm -i when I get to the office
tomorrow.
