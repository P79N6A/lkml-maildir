No, that will not be a problem. You just resume system as you do now,
most pages will be not there. *But kernel knows it is not there*, and
will on-demand load them back. It will be normal userland application
doing readback. There's absolutely no risk of corruption.
Imagine something that saves list of needed pages before suspend, then
does something like
cat `cat /proc/[0-9]*/maps | grep / | sed 's:.* /:/:' | sort -u` > /dev/null
...it should work pretty well. And worst thing it can do is send your
system thrashing.
