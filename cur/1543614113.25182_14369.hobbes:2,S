So, encouraging non-uniform terminology, breaking applicates *and* 
confusing the hell out of everyone is better?  Face it, the only 
people trying to confuse things are the disk vendors.  DRAM is sold 
by the MB, everyone talks about MB == 1024*1024...  I'm having a 
hard time giving a sympathetic ear to anyone try to change the well 
established, and consistent (barring the storage venduhs), standard.
