Yeah, now that you say it, another "halt" problem was some floppy DMA 
apparently being broken by halt on some machines.
The indirect point of that being that the boot-time hlt test wouldn't 
actually have triggered that anyway (no DMA taking place at that time).
Although I suspect back when this mattered (a long long time ago ;), the 
boot-time hlt test made a lot of people more _aware_ of the fact that halt 
could cause problems.
Sometimes the solutions are purely psychological ;)
