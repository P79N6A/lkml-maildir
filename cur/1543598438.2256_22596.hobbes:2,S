I will -- thank you for the words. :)

exactly.  this thread has gone off on a tangent arguing the very merits
of /dev/random itself.  obviously if you dislike the kernel's entropy
gatherer, this patch won't sit well either.
the proper argument is, assuming that /dev/random is A Good Thing, is
this patch useful?  since its configurable, its not forcing any policy.
since it can be argued pretty strongly that more entropy is needed on a
headless and/or diskless, I think some people need it.  personally, it
boosts my self-esteem to have another source of entropy (my 3c905).  if
you are worried of the threats net devices have to your entropy, by all
means -- dont enable the config setting.

hopefully we can get the patch merged, if for nothing else for 2.5.
