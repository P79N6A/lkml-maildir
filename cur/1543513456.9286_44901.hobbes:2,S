Linus, I hate to be a pain about ptrace, but in the following .22 change

I think there ought to be a check against NR_syscalls like this:				case 
ORIG_EAX:
        		if (value >= NR_syscalls)

Otherwise, bogus ptrace calls are going to apparently succeed when they should 
return error.
Was there a particular reason you did things this way?
