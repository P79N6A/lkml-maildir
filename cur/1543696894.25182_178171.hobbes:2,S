Hi Andries,
Yes, with 2.4 I used sda1. When I first compiled 2.6 I used sda1 but I got
the 'wrong fs..' error. This was a clean install of debian so I didn't have
my original fstab. I checked the web and noticed people using sda. so I
tried that - same error. In trying to get this to work I've used sda and
sda1 at different times both gave the same errors.
Thanks for your reply,
