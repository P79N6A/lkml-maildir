Not that I know of -- though I have some bits
that might help someone get started, perhaps
in combination with the sa11x0-ish code that
I found starting at www.handhelds.org.
If you're going to start, more power to you!!
I think a PXA-25x driver will be interesting
to a lot of people.  Its USB support looks to
be flexible enough to support quite a lot of
interesting Linux-based applications:  lots of
endpoints, including ISO support.
