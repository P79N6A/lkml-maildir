Again, this is the code of such function:
static inline int raw_irqs_disabled_flags(unsigned long flags)
{
         return !(flags & X86_EFLAGS_IF);
}
so all it is doing is getting a parameter (flags), and bitmasking it. It 
is not talking to any hypervisor. I can't see your point. Unless you are
arguing that it _should_ be talking to a hypervisor. Is that your point?
If it is the case, please tell me why. My current understanding is that 
we want to keep few changes from the normal kernel. So there is not too 
much reason for it.
