On my quad xeon I have an odd problem with scsi on any 2.1 or 2.2 
system.  If I have the symbios set up to scan my lvds drives when I
power it up, it finds everything and correctly reports fast-40 and
so forth, but on bootup, I start getting oddball messages like keyboard
lost interrupt, HDA (cd rom on IDE) lost interrupts, and it hangs 
pretty quickly (this an Intel SC450NX).  If I simply tell the symbios
utility to _not_ scan devices (except for boot drive which is on a 
different controller) at bootup, all works fine.
I've just ignored it since I have a workaround...
