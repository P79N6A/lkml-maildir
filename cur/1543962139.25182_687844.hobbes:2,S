When a teacher assigns grades in a class, it's not punishment, it's feedback.
I don't think anyone *intends* to push crap into the tree. However,
with the barrier to getting things into the tree so low, some may feel
there's less incentive to try to get things right the first (or
second) time. It would be nice to provide that incentive.
Normally, it'd be peer-review of the uncommitted patches. We don't
have a lot of that going on here, though. So,
peer-review-after-the-fact, ie, who placed this massive turd in the
tree, and everyone swivels an eye over there and asks what went wrong,
and how do we prevent it in the future. Those conversations seem to be
happening already, time to time.
And as a policy suggestion, if we're past rc1 and someone has
identified a commit as the root of a regression/bug, then the policy
should be just to revert it immediately, no questions asked. Let the
original author work with the person who identified the problem and
resend a fixed commit later. We lose testers in the meantime, and
perhaps the extra effort involved in having the author work out the
issues and redo the patch will help prevent drive-by patching in the
future.
