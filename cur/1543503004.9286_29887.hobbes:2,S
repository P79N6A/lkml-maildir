"pcbus" would certainly fit my requirement for being specific enough, and
it's probably non-specific enough that others wouldn't jump up and down
too much.
However, at the same time it doesn't actually "say" much to me either.
"ioport_resource" is fairly descriptive: the thing it guards are actually
commonly called "IO ports". Compared to that "pcbus_io_resource" is too
bland, and while it's logical it doesn't tell people who are used to the
terminology exactly what's up.
So I've already set my heart on "ioport". I don't know about "iomem",
though: nobody calls memory-mapped accesses "IO memory" accesses. "PCI
memory" actually describes at least to me exactly what it's all about,
which is why I liked "pci_mem_resource". "pcbus_mem" lacks that mental
image for me.
Oh, well. It's just a name. Or two, actually.
