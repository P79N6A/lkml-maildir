Hi everybody,
I'm using the cryptoapi since more than a year (2.4.4)....  Now I tried to move
to newer kernel (2.4.17) and I'm not able to setup a loop device with
the new kernel..... 
I patched the 2.4.17 kernel with patch-int-2.4.17.0.gz,
                                 loop-jari-2.4.16.0.patch
 and everything compiled fine... 
I build the util-linux-2.11n with the new patches 
 and everything compiled fine....
then I loaded all modules cryptoapi,cipers, digest,
etc....  and tried:
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=1024k count=100
# losetup -e twofish /dev/loop0 file 
Available keysizes (bits): 128 192 256 
# Keysize: 256
# Password :
# Password :
The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to be loaded into the kernel
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
and thats it.... with every cipher.
Is there anybody out there who can help me ????
Any comment is welcome.
so long
