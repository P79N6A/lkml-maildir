   OK, the problem is that gcc expects size_t to be an unsigned int.  We use
   unsigned long for size_t in the kernel because we want it to be 64 bits on
   64-bit PPCs (like it is on the other 64-bit platforms).  Gcc doesn't like a
   prototype for memcpy which has an unsigned long for the 3rd argument
   (unless you use -fno-builtin).
So conditionalize the size_t type in the asm/types.h header based
upon __ppc64__ or whatever.
This argument you make is sort of non-sensical to me :-)
