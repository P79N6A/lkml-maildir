I would do it thisway if possible, yes.

First implementation would be per-cpu just rwsems. A second patch
to make it just an array rwsem->count's plus a shared queue may
be in order - OTOH everyone does their own rwsems, so this will be
a bit of a headache.
I forget - are you just planning to use one global brsem? In this
case the size issue wouldn't be a pressing one.
