Andrzej is using a glibc that "does not support minors > 255".
The oldest glibc I have around here is glibc-2.2.5-34 and it passes
Andrzej's `for a in $(seq 4);do ssh -t remote tty;done' test OK.  I do not
know at which version they started to permit larger values for minors, but
it must have been some time ago.
A small number of people are hurting from the removal of first-fit pty
allocation and I do think it needs to be put back.  I have a patch but
neither Peter nor I have actually tested it yet.  I'll aim to get it into
2.6.6.
