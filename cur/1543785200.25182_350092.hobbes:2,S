    [PATCH] spinlock consolidation
    
    This patch (written by me and also containing many suggestions of Arjan van
    de Ven) does a major cleanup of the spinlock code.  It does the following
    things:
	[snip]
    arm, i386, ia64, ppc, ppc64, s390/s390x, x64 was build-tested via
    crosscompilers.  m32r, mips, sh, sparc, have not been tested yet, but should
    be mostly fine.
P. S.: git bisect absolutely rocks! 10 minutes.
