Hello,
I just tested to uhci-hsd one-line patch sent by Wim Van Sebroeck. USB works 
fine again now.
In addition to that the strange e100 problems are also gone now. I double 
checked this by removing the patch once again. Without the patch e100 is 
dead, with the patch everything works fine. Interesting what an USB patch can 
do to a NIC (a side effect of irq problems?).
This only leaves the SWSUP problem open. An 
echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep
still shows no effect at all (see also the original mail). Is SWSUP supposed 
to work in test6?
bye,
