Actually, unless you want the kernel to have to poll the timeout_flag
periodically, it's more like:
	volatile bool	timeout_flag = false, armed_flag = false;
	register_timout(&time_val, &flag);
	while (work to do) {
		if (!armed_flag) {
			rearm_timeout();
			armed_flag = true;
		}
		do_a_bit_of_work();
		if (timeout_flag) {
			armed_flag = false;
			timeout_flag = false;
			break;
		}
	}
Personally, I use setitimer() for this.  You can maintain the flags in
software, and be slightly lazy about disarming it.  If you get a signal
while you shouldn't be armed, *then* disarm the timer in the kernel.
Likewise, when rearming, set the user-disarmed flag and chec if kernel-level
rearming is required.
volatile bool timeout_flag = false, armed_flag = false, sys_armed_flag = false;
void
sigalrm(int sig)
{
	(void)sig;
	if (!armed_flag) {
		static const struct itimerval it_zero = {{0,0},{0,0}};
		if (sys_armed_flag)
			warn_unexpected_sigalrm();
		setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &it_zero, 0);
		
	} else if (timeout_flag)
		warn_gc_is_slow();
	else
		timeout_flag = true;
}
void
arm_timer()
{
	static const struct itimerval it_interval = { time_val, time_val };
	armed_flag = true;
	if (!sys_armed_flag) {
		setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &it_interval, 0);
		sys_armed_flag = true;
	}
}
main_loop()
{
	signal(SIGALRM, sigalrm);
	while (work to do) {
		arm_timer();
		do_a_bit_of_work();
		if (timeout_flag) {
			gc();
			armed_flag = false;
			timeout_flag = false;
		}
	}
}
... where only do_a_bit_of_work can prompt the need for more gc() calls.
This really tries to minimize the number of system calls.
