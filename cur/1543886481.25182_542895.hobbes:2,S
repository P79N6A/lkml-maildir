Yes, but in our case we don't care. This is a dedicated server where we
don't see any usage for NLM client. We just want to prevent the kernel
from taking the port in case of some accidental NFS mount that ommitted
'nolock'.

I repeat: The kernel _NEEDS_ to register RPC service 100021 on the
client so that rpc.statd can find it and notify it of server reboots.
