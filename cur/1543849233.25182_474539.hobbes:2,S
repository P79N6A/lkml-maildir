Works for me, and has done for a long time and I've also had no other
reports of this in the past couple of years so I'm curious what trips it
in your case ?

We need to know all the references have gone away, if someone has a disk
referenced and you pull it out we can't clean up immediately so this is
the right place to get stuck both on a refcounting bug and if you've got
something holding a reference for real (eg HAL)
