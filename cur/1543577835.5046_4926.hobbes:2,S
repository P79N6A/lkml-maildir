Alan, it doesn't work that way. Maximal size depends on the type of object,
for one thing. Moreover, it's not always a multiple of page size, so you
still need foo_get_block() to be aware of the problem (it should return
-EFBIG). Besides, we need to take care of the situations when some of
get_block() calls fail in prepare_write() - that can happen due to other
problems. I've fixed all that stuff for ext2 (check the patches posted on
l-k after 12-pre6). We need to propagate it into other filesystems, but
I don't think that max size in pages is really worth the trouble.
I can pull these patches out of the mix and send them to you. ACK?
