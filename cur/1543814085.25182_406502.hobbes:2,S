Ugly, isn't it.  The collision of two source styles has left some 
scars.  And fixing it is not yet finished.  We know about these 
problems, and we are working on getting rid of them.  The historical 
version garbage is rather important to us internally, and these bits are 
not yet fully polished, so you get to see it to.  I think you'll find us 
respecting Linux conventions a lot more in the later patches.
