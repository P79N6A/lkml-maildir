I've seen your posts. Can't help you directly, but:

Do bugs bite you with plain partitions (no RAID). Maybe it's a RAID bug?

Can you run oom_trigger at this point and watch what will happen?
It will force most (if not all) of the page cache to be flushed, speed might
increase. This is not a solution, just a way to get additional info on bug
behavior. I've got a little patch which improves (read: fixes) cache flush
behavior. Attached below. BTW, did you try -aa kernels?

After they hang, make Alt-SysRq-T trace, ksymoops it and send to Rik and LKML.
CC'ing Andrea won't hurt I think.
