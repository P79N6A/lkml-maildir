pure == 2.5.68
kludge == 2.5.68+kludge in blkdev_put()
% grep Dirt =noinitrd-*
=noinitrd-kludge=:Dirty:               0 kB   # before
=noinitrd-kludge=:Dirty:               4 kB   # after
=noinitrd-pure=:Dirty:               0 kB     # before
=noinitrd-pure=:Dirty:               4 kB     # after
So it would appear to me that initrd is the common denominator among
those of us reporting similar symptoms.
