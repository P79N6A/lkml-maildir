Fuse APIs are very stable, so pushing old filesystems out to userspace
makes sense.  Porting them, however, is not entirely trivial.  Amit
Singh (of MacFUSE) got minix, ufs and sysvfs to work on OSX using only
lightly modified linux source code.  That framework could probably be
used to port other filesystems to userspace.
