You've been bitten by this "feature" also.
Note it's been in the list many times. See:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2001-12/0405.html
In summary you need the following kernel parameter:
hdb=flash (I know your hdb is NOT flash but this is
consistent with this "feature").
BTW testing with 2.2.18, hdb would silently be ignored.
Kernel panic is well probably more consistent with this
"feature".
Any progress/more info on why this "feature" is required?
