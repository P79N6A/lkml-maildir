How about just marking the ones I've already done in #gccbug?
If I'm taking the time to audit the code, and separate out bogosities 
from real bugs, it would be nice not to see that effort wasted.
#gccbug includes _only_ the bogosities.  I didn't just blindly paper 
over everything with a 'may be used uninitialized' warning.  I'm well 
over halfway through the 'make allmodconfig' build, and as LKML emails 
can attest, have found several valid warnings.
