No, the contents of initrd/initramfs is not shipped as part of a
standard kernel.org kernel.  It is the responsibility of each
distribution to set up their initrd or initramfs initial boot scripts
themselves.  One could argue that it would be better if there were a
standard set of initrd scripts (and udev binaries) paired with
specific kernel.org kernels and used by all distro's, but that's not
where we are right now.
The data is most certainly accessible from normal userspace
applications.  All they have to do is link against blkid library;
indeed the kernel doesn't do any LABEL= or UUID= searching at all.  By
design, it all supposed to be done in userspace.
