This is not something we (the Linux for S/390 development team) can decide;
it's up to the hardware groups that 'own' the LCS / QDIO specifications
whether they allow to make these public.  As I said, at this point, we
are not allowed to open the specs; while it is conceivable that this might
change in the future, I'm not aware of any specific plan.
(Please note that I'm in no way speaking for IBM here; that's just my
personal opinion.)
