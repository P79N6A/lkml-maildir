Applied.  I also took the liberty of fixing the "Step 5"
comment above, it should be "Step 6" :-)
Yan, please fix your patch postings.  Your email client
adds newlines, and changes tabs into spaces, totally corrupting
your patches.  I have to apply every one of your patches by
hand because of this.
To be honest, gmail has been shown to be a very unusable place
from which to send patches.  There are certain kinds of outgoing
text mangling that I do not know if they even allow to disable.
Thanks.
