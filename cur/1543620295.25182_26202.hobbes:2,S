Hi,
I got the zero-filled files after reboot. I've tried
to compile two kernels (one with make -j2 and
the other one just with make) simultaneously having
3 running 'find . -type f print0 | xargs -0 cat >/dev/null'.
After reboot i've got .config of the one of the kernels
filled with zeroes, also .bash_history and some others
(all of them reside on a reserfs volume, and my home, btw).
The copies of the bzImage's and modules are ok (they were
to ext2 volumes).
I suppose the files were open for writing at some point
of that session. I'm sure they were closed to the moment
of system shutdown (i've killall5 -TERM ... sequence in
the shutdown scripts).
There were no crashes or suspicious messages on the console.
Nothing special in logs, and sorry, reiserfs self-debugging
wasn't enabled.
