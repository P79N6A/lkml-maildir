SuSE started shipping 7.1 with a 2.4.0 kernel (optional). I think I installed
it on a development workstation just about the time when 2.4.2 was released.
For what we do (www.enidan.com), I tend to be more conservative, so we were
using 2.0.36 for quite some time, until we decided to move entirely to 2.2.12.
Our 16CPU cluster is up at 2.4.8 - trying to break things :-) -  but for things 
that people depend on, it's 2.2.19. Some workstations are at 2.4.x - depends.
