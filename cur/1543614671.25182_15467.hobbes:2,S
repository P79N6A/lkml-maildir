I remind you: ORACLE 9i is requiring half a gig as a minimum just due to the
use of the CRAPPY PIECE OF SHIT written in the Java, called, you guess 
it: Just the
bloody damn Installer. Java is really condemned just due to the fact 
that both terms: speed
and memmory usage are both allways only *relative* to other systems.
And yes GC's have only one problem - they try to give a general solution 
for problems
which can be easly prooven to be mathmematically insolvable. The 
resulting undeterministic
behaviour of applications is indeed the thing which is hurting most.
