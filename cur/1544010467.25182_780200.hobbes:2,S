BTW I looked for settings in EEPROM and didn't find any.

This is something that should rather change in mac80211, I think.  It 
just toggles the state on every packet, and we just do the same when
mac80211 says so (ath5k *could* set up timers like b43, but it's a
lot of extra code, and every driver shouldn't have to do so.)
