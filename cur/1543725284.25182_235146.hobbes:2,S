typically all of this happens with irqs enabled (unmask=1), but it still
increases scheduling latencies.
with the default DMA setup of today's ATA hw there can be a maximum of
256 entries in the sg-table all zapped in ide_end_request() ->
__end_that_request_first().
Plus the IDE driver also builds the sg-table of the next request in
hardirq context. (ide_build_dmatable() and ide_build_sglist()).
