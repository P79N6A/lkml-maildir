Well, it's strictly only for the cpu bitmap (and it's designed to be different 
depending on the arch so you can use arch specific CPU enumeration knowlege).  
The O(1) optimisation for this is easy:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#define for_each_cpu(cpu, mask) \
        for(mask = cpu_online_map; \
            cpu = __ffs(mask), mask != 0; \
            mask &= ~(1<<cpu))
#else
#define for_each_cpu(cpu, mask) cpu = 1; 
#endif
because you don't really want to run an SMP kernel on a machine which has only 
one cpu.  Or did you mean you'd like to see it work with the O(1) scheduler, 
some kind of generic for_each_set_bit?
