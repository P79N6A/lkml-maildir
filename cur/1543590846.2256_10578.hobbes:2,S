This is the main reason I like the current 2.4.x behavior.
I hate config options that change how the core of the kernel
boot makes decisions.  Things like "where is root", "what is
my network address or where do I get that information" have
no reasonable default.  This is why the command line args
are there.
If you want a kernel which automatically does "foo", you have
several options already by which to do this:
1) Many platforms allow you to store a boot comand line
   in the firmware (Sparc, several MIPS, PPC, etc.)
2) Failing #1, you can add a default prefix/postfix to the
   kernel command line at build time if you wish, just add
   some simple variable to the toplevel Makefile and have
   init/main.c frob this thing onto the kernel command
   line string after initially fetching it.
Really, H. J., you are asking for a static command line feature.
That's cool, so add it :-)
