Kernal: 2.2.12
Original Dist: Slackware 4.0
System: i386, Intel dual 266mhz (SMP compiled), 128m ram
Problem:
	System hangs if I mount a ide CD-ROM drive. This was also
happening with the original 2.2.6 kernal that came with the June edition
of Slackware 4.0  Appears 2.2.12 still has the same prob.
	This doesn't happen with the same machine running 2.0.38 or
earlier. CD-ROM drive is a Mitsumi fx 600 series 40x drive. The IDE
controllers is on the motherboard. Motherboard is made by "Amptron."
	Hope this helps. Sorry if I have sent this info to the wrong
place. A relative "beginner" here. . .
