When compiling v2.3.16 at least a few warnings showed. Some of them are
old acquaintances, such as the 8390 & scsi warnings, but the sched, irq &
init_task ones are new.
The new serialP thingie also seem to miss some #ifdef CONFIG_PCI's; the
kernel FLOODS my screen with warnings when compiling an MCA-kernel.
See below my sig.
