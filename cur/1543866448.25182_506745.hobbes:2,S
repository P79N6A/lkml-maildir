This is just the recovery part.  Need more log.  If possible, please 
give a shot at 2.6.20.  It might have fixed your problem or at least 
allow better diagnosis.

I see.

It might be.  Quite some SATA bug reports turn out to be hardware 
problem, most commonly PSU issues.

Hmmm...

Yeah, please post the content of /var/log/boot.msg if available and the 
result of dmesg and lspci -nn.
