As far as I can tell from a *very* brief look at your code (which means 
I might have misread it), these are the differences:
- gcc uses %fs:0 to contain a pointer to itself.
- gcc uses absolute offsets from the thread pointer, rather than adding
   %rip.  The %rip-based form is actually more efficient, but it does
   affect the usable range off the base pointer.
