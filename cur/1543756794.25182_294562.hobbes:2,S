At line 3887 of cpu.ckrm-e17.v10.patch you add the line:
		set_task_cpu(p,this_cpu);
to the middle of the function wake_up_new_task() resulting in the 
following code:
	} else {
		this_rq = cpu_rq(this_cpu);
		/*
		 * Not the local CPU - must adjust timestamp. This should
		 * get optimised away in the !CONFIG_SMP case.
		 */
		p->sdu.ingosched.timestamp = (p->sdu.ingosched.timestamp - 
this_rq->timestamp_last_tick)
					+ rq->timestamp_last_tick;
		set_task_cpu(p,this_cpu);
		__activate_task(p, rq);
		if (TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR(p, rq))
			resched_task(rq->curr);
		schedstat_inc(rq, wunt_moved);
		/*
		 * Parent and child are on different CPUs, now get the
		 * parent runqueue to update the parent's ->sdu.ingosched.sleep_avg:
		 */
		task_rq_unlock(rq, &flags);
		this_rq = task_rq_lock(current, &flags);
	}
where "rq" has been set by the return value of "task_rq_lock(p, 
&flags)", and the test "(cpu == this_cpu)" has failed with "cpu" set to 
"task_cpu(p)".  The result of this when the CKRM CPU code is not 
configured into the build is that "p" will be queued on a runqueue that 
is not in agreement with "p->thread_info->cpu" which in turn will lead 
to future use of "task_rq_lock()" locking the wrong run queue and 
eventually triggering some form of race condition.
If CKRM CPU is configured into the build the results are less drastic as 
they only result in "nr_running" being incremented for the wrong run 
queue.  However, even this will have adverse scheduling effects as it 
will probably confuse the load balancing code.  Another potentially 
confusing thing with this code (when CKRM CPU is configured in) is that 
__activate_task() does NOT queue "p" on "rq" but on the queue found by 
the call "get_task_lrq(p)".
The recommended fix for this problem would be to withdraw the:
		set_task_cpu(p,this_cpu);
