Oh, and running also an jackd 0.99.17cvs _without_ the xrun trace
auto-trigger patch, so to end up with a production-like system.
And that was it. After a total of 4 hours running free, the jack_test3
suite spitted out these results, which speak from themselves:

This is frankly the best performance EVER on this laptop machine, given
these jackd parameters (-R -P60 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p64 -n2 -S -P).
Next step is really trying to increase the stress and look after when it
will break apart. It will not take too long...
First attempts, by just increasing the client count from 16 to 20, are
leading to what will be the next "horror show" :) CPU tops above 90%, and
after a couple of minutes running steadly it enters into some kind of
turbulence and hangs. Yeah, it just freezes completely.
So I guess we're having a lot more food to mangle ;)
Stay tuned.
