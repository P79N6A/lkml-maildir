I've toyed with this several times on sparc64, and in my experience
the extra memory reference on page->virtual costs on average about the
same as the non-power-of-2 pointer arithmetic.
The decision is absolutely arbitrary performance wise, but if you
consider the memory wastage on enormous systems going without
page->virtual I think is clearly better.
