Well, here's the list of modules I have loaded:
nfsd                  102496   8 (autoclean)
lockd                  72976   1 (autoclean) [nfsd]
sunrpc                 87984   1 (autoclean) [nfsd lockd]
nls_iso8859-1           4160   1 (autoclean)
nls_cp437               5664   1 (autoclean)
msdos                   7728   1 (autoclean)
fat                    42784   0 (autoclean) [msdos]
pas2                   17488   1
sound                  83184   1 [pas2]
soundcore               5568   5 [sound]
Are there any known problems with these?  I have at times also used
matroxfb, and usb-uhci (along with visor, usb-storage), but I've seen
the process-table-hang with matroxfb and usb-uhci *not* installed, so I
don't think that's it.  I have the above modules installed consistently
at each bootup.
