But these are not guaranteed to reclaim all the dentries from a given
superblock. Yes, they move the dentries to the LRU, but other activity in the
system means that they may not get reclaimed during the subsequent calls
to prune_dcache() and hence they may live beyond the unmount....

It's not the unmount that slows down - it's the fact that the dcache lock
is held for so long that rest of the system halts for time it takes
to run shrink_dcache_sb(). We've seen up to 50s to do a (touch fred; rm fred)
when the LRU has grown to several million dentries and shrink_dcache_sb()
is running. When this happens, it's not uncommon to see every CPU in the
machine spinning on the dcache_lock...
Cheers,
Dave.
