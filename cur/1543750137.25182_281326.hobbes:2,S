Subject: PATCH: 2.6.10 - CREDITS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Paul Laufer informed the list that he had changed address and his change
of address had been ignored so CREDITS was still wrong although other
files had been updated.
Fix this.
