Like Lee said, for "debugging", mainly trying to resolve unexplained
long latencies.
I've had a laptop that caused latency spikes with the cpu fan was turn
on. I tried disabling SMI to diagnose the problem with no success.
My current system has a BIOS feature to control fans speed according to
temperature. I presume this must a SMI to work right?  In this case it
should be possible to find and disable the related SMI and replace the
fan control with a user space software.
Of course it's not wise to blindly disable SMIs as we don't precisely
know what they do.
