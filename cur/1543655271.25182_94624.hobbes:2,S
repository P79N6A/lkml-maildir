I tried both hdparm commands on hdb/hdc/hdd and they didn't print out any
errors, but the performance hasn't changed any. I'm only concerned with
scattered read access performance, write performance is fairly irrelevant.
Is the lack of a UDMA mode related to the kernel message of "DMA disabled"?
Thanks--
