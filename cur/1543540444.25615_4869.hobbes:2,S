I fear it's not possible without at least partially understanding what's
going on with the mouse data, which the current driver does not. The
only heuristic I can imagine right now is checking that the 0xaa byte
was not preceded or followed by any other communication in any
direction for a reasonanble amounf of time (half a second or so).
