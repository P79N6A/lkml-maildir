Notice that we are talking about Preempt-RT here. Everything is
running in thread context, even tasklets, softirqs etc. They are _all_
preemptible, and if Michael has some RT-thread in the system that has
a higher priority than this tasklet or softirq, than the buffer will
eventually overflow.
I wonder also if Michael has set the RT-priorities correctly, on RT
_every_ softirq/irq thread starts by default on priority 50,
SCHED_FIFO. If they are still at 50, any other softirq/tasklet, or irq
can make this behavior worse.
Notice that the default 50 thingy rarely gives a decent behaving
system. (But any other default will also give problems anyway, so it
_has_ to be customized/tuned by the end user)
Kind Regards,
Remy
