a better way would be then to have a "core" module which is basically
collecting these algorithms, and then have the algorithm modules, when
they are loaded, register themselves with this core module. (and
unregister at unload). It's sort of inside-out with they way you're
trying to do it, but it'll work out a lot nicer. Obviously the user of
the algorithms can be another module in addition to this core module.
(and even register algorithms itself)
There's many examples in the kernel that work similar to this, for
example the crypto framework.
