Hi
I understand this as a logical answer to "Designed for Windows", but is 
it really what we want?
After all, "Runs with Linux" (or such) does not, by it self, speak about 
closed drivers. Also, it will only attract Linux-users toward a goal 
everyone would gain from: maintainable drivers after "expiration" date. 
Why not something more of "Runs on Open Drivers", which also gives us a 
chance to "teach" people why to use an open OS without the replies:
"Windows is pretty" (actually, it was a guy who told me that)
"It is difficult (to learn new stuff)"
etc..
Even in the short run (we _will_ have world-domination someday ;) ) I 
think such an approach is more beneficial because we can gather force 
from *BSD, Solaris and (even) Windows-users as well.
Well, just an idea...
