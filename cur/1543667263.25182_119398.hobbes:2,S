I just want to clear things out.
This check was in kernels before 2.4.19 too.
if (csr0 & 0x0800) {
            printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Bus master arbitration failure, status %4.4x.\n",
                   dev->name, csr0);
            /* unlike for the lance, there is no restart needed */
        }
But I've never seen nor this message neither kernel lockups before
2.4.19. And even for kernels > 2.4.19 it seems UP systems are not
affected (There are no such problems on my UP Netfinity 5100 so far).
