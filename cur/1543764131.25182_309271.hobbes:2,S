Subject: Scheduling tasklets from process context...

Hi,
I have a query.
Since tasklets are typically used for bottom half
processing, is it acceptable/recommended that they
be scheduled from a process context (say an ioctl handler)?
Should one try to minimize such scheduling and try to
do things in process context if possible, as tasklets run
in interrupt context? Or is the driver writer free to use
the tasklets at will? What is recommended here?
Thanks in advance,
Arun.
