I had this problem too, at boot up.  I too have a REALTEK 8139 controller and it shares the interrupt with the USB, which I am not
using.  The oops was consistent everytime I tried to boot, so I couldn't really capture it.  I configured USB support as a module, voila
the system boots fine and has up for 48 hours.  I have no USB devices, just built the modules since there seems to be changes in that
area.  I have not tried backing out the USB support, and testing again.
I built test12 from source, no patches.  I had no problems with any of the pre releases for test12.
