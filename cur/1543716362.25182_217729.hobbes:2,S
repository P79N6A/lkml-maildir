I have found the reason. Due to a linking problem, the exec'ed process
always quietly died. Of course only in the boot process, not during
dry-run testing. So I had falsely assumed that exec'ing from #1 might
always lead to a panic if you don't use the initrd procedure.
Thanks four your kind advice.
