Yes, but it doesn't tell us why kernels 2.4x felt perfectly happy with the old 
BIOS...
Furthermore, I'm afraid I may have exchanged a problem for a worse one :-(
Besides this USB/IRQ issue, my system was completely stable and had been for 2 
years. Never experienced a system hang (except when I tried early 2.6 kernels 
up to 2.6.8...)
Alas, today it hanged completely 3 times :-(
When I say completely, I mean complete system hang, display frozen, keyboard 
dead (even the Magic SysRQ key doesn't respond), network dead (doen't ping 
back), no visible activity of any kind :-((
...and of course nothing got logged.
This happened 4 times. The 3 first times, I was running with IO-APIC enabled 
and the system was under high disk activity:
1/ 1st time, I was copying the complete contents of a loopback-mounted ISO 
image to a directory. The system hanged.
2/ 2nd time, I tried the same. The system hanged again.
3/ 3rd time, I was generating an ISO fs (mkisofs). The system hanged.
The 4th time, I was running the kernel booted with "noapic". The system was 
doing nothing and had gone to screen saver mode, then to screen off. When I 
moved the mouse nothing happened. I noticed the system had silently died :-(
Now I'm running with IO-APIC enabled, bus USB 2.0 adn ehci completely disabled 
(both in BIOS and modprobe.conf).
The system hasn't hanged again, but I haven't tried to play with on-disk ISO 
filesystems since...
Sigh. I never had any problem with this system for 2 years running kernel 2.4. 
I've had nothing but problems since running kernel 2.6 :-((
(Not to mention that EVMS snapshots don't work anymore in kernel 2.6 and badly 
corrupt filesystems [snapshots origins] spitting tons of :
totor kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
totor kernel: dm-5: rw=0, want=990604112, limit=2031614
totor kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
totor kernel: dm-5: rw=0, want=990604112, limit=2031614
...but this is yet another story...
I'm afraid I will end hating kernel 2.6 as much as I hate M$ things... )
Cheers.
