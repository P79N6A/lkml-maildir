"Don't do that".  You'll lose the ability to access the operations on
the fd once you are no longer the original task (explicit check).,
It's not an exact match, but a file is a remarkably convenient
abstraction for a non-ABI such as lguest.  Of course, Carsten was
talking about unifying the lguest & kvm userspace interface, so this
could well change anyway.
