That looks like something in the guts of the initrd; it probably thinks 
you need pata_amd and it's unhappy that you don't have it.
Actually, another thing to try is making the ATA/etc one be "y" and 
pata_amd be "m". Most likely, this should lead to the ATA one claiming the 
drive before the module is loaded (but the module would be loaded later, 
to avoid upsetting the initrd); you should be able to tell from dmesg (or 
/dev, for that matter) which one got it, and I think built-in drivers will 
claim everything they can before an initrd gets loaded.

Assuming it isn't picking up your hard drive, which it isn't, that 
shouldn't matter.
