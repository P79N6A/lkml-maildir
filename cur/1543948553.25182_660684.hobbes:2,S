truncate is handled by the range invalidates. This is special code to deal 
with the unnap/clean of an individual page.

Nope. unmap_mapping_range is already handled by the range callbacks.

The situation that you are imagining has already been dealt with by the 
earlier patches. This is only to allow sleeping while unmapping individual 
pages.
