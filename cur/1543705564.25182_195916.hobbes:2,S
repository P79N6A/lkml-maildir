Can you please move that into some file in include/linux ?  IMHO all
ioctls should be in some header, otherwise nobody knows you reserved
the number. Note that ioctl numbers must be unique in Linux. Also it
would be good if you added an
register_ioctl32_conversion(IBMASM_IOCTL_MAGIC, sys_ioctl) or an
COMPATIBLE_IOCTL in compat_ioctl.h for it to make it transparently
work with the 32bit emulation layers.
