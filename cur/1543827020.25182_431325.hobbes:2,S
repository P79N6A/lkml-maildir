As Ralf Baechle points out the definition and the declaration of
mem_map are made under differing config options.  This leads to
difficulty tracking errant references to mem_map when it is not
available.  Below is a patch to sort out the mem_map definition,
making the fact that it is part of the FLATMEM memory model explicit.
It builds and boots on all my test boxes.  It build tests for
all sane combinations of memory model on x86.  The most likely
architecture to have trouble with this is arm as it makes significant
use of mem_map, but as far as I know it uses FLATMEM and should
be fine.  Testing there would be helpful.

mem_map is part of the FLATMEM model
It seems that the definition and declaration of mem_map are
inconsistent meaning we get usless undirected link failures about
mem_map when its being used when it shouldn't be.
Reviewing mem_map, its actually only valid and initialised when
CONFIG_FLATMEM is defined.  Indeed in all essence it is part
of that memory model used out of FLATMEM's __pfn_to_page etc.
mem_map (and max_mapnr) should only be defined and declared when
the FLATMEM memory model is selected.
