Generally speaking, I think until this algorithm has an adaptive-timeout in addition to an adaptive-spin/sleep, these .config based defaults are a good idea.  Sometimes setting these things at runtime are a PITA when you are talking about embedded systems that might not have/want a nice userspace sysctl-config infrastructure.  And changing the defaults in the code is unattractive for some users.  I don't think its a big deal either way, so if people hate the config options, they should go.  But I thought I would throw this use-case out there to ponder.
