Clarification:  "nope" == "nope, we don't use that to the full yet"

And one more:  the Promise hardware allows multiple disk transactions to 
be chained together in a sequence, such that, you only receive an 
interrupt when the full sequence is complete (or there is an error). 
You can look at it as either interrupt coalescing, or simply coalescing 
of multiple low-level disk transactions into a single "RAID transaction."
