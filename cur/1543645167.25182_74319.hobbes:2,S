I have some more informations for you:
dmesg - output with mem=248M

Someone told me to post the output from the serial port. Sorry, i have used
minicom, cat and a null modem cabel, but there's no output.
When I use 256MB RAM, all works fine with mem=248M, if i use 512MB RAM and 
mem=504M, the maschine crashs after a full memory use like compiling a kernel.
Thx
