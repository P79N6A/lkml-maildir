    Another problem area is ECC monitoring.  I'm still waiting for

Add environemt monitoring. One mf my play machines is a dell 2540,
dual AC power, lots os fans and temperature sensing, I'd really like
to be able to get this information from it (yeah, closed source Dell
drivers are worth almost zero).
