the current->cpus_allowed I think probably should have been
"prev->cpus_allowed" in the original code?  However, in light of the new
findings with this bug Mike found, this should probably be sent to
allbutself() without the mask since you don't know what could have been
queued behind you.
Unless I am missing something?
