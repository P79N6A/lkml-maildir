 I seemed to miss the original post, so I can't really comment on the
tests. However...

 The strace here shows select() with an infinite timeout, you're
numbers will be much better if you do (pseudo code)...
  struct timeval zerotime;
  zerotime.tv_sec = 0;
  zerotime.tv_usec = 0;
 if (!(ret = select( ... , &zerotime)))
  ret = select( ... , NULL);
...basically you completely miss the function call for __pollwait()
inside poll_wait (include/linux/poll.h in the linux sources, with
__pollwait being in fs/select.c).
