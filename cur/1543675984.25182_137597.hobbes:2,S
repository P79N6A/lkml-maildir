I'd suggest changing the name. It's not "tkill2", it's a totally new 
system call with different inputs.
How about calling it "tgkill()" for "thread" and "group", which are the 
new inputs?
It would also seem a lot cleaner that the "any" value be "-1" (like it is
for the other kill functions), and it works for both tgid _and_ for pid,
so that
	tgkill(-1, pid, sig) == tkill(pid, sig) == kill thread
	tgkill(pid, -1, sig) == kill(pid, sig) == kill group
You made the "any" value be 0, and working only for the group. At least to
me, "0" historically means "this process group", while "-1" means "any"
for the signals.
("0" for "this thread group" might make sense, but if I read the patch 
correctly, you really have "0 == _any_ thread group").
Hmm?
