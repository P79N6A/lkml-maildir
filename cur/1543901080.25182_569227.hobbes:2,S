Well, I took a 2.6.21 (gentoo-patchset...) and applied your cfs-v19 
patch for the 2.6.21 kernels. Its a amd64 system and the "normal" 
(=only gentoo patches) kernel is working fine!

When I start the system, the mouse is jerking like under heavy load. 
(also its idle!)
Then some programs just quit. They just disappear, no message in any 
log. (It were about four apps I realized in a period of about two hours 
of testing.)
I'll try a git snapshot next, but is there a way I can get more output?
