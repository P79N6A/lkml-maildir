Following up on this from yesterday, Linus please revert the above cset.
It doesn't seem to be necessary (it was added to fix a miscompile in
'make allnoconfig' which doesn't seem to be repeatable with it reverted)
and actively breaks the ARM SA1100 framebuffer driver.
(If you'd prefer a patch reverting it, I'll send one, but I'm
 hoping that git-revert will just dtrt).
Thanks,
	Dave
