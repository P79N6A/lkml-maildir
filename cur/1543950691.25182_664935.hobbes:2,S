thanks for that hint, I'll investigate that too.
The HBA is a Qlogic QLA-2460. Based on some past experience with 
other brands of FC HBA's, I tend to swear on Qlogic as the reference 
implementation of FC hardware.
The driver I've tried so far is the vanilla version in 2.6.22.6 and 
2.6.24.2. The firmware that I load at runtime is something I've 
downloaded from Qlogic web maybe four months ago... time to update my 
firmware :-)
