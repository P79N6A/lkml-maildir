Well, I'm a bit suspicious about that. ;-)
Namely, if you run your suspend code on one CPU and (do I remeber correctly
that?) with kernel preemption disabled, then you practically prevent user land
processes from being scheduled when your suspend code is running.
If that is the case (of which I'm not sure), the freezer is obviously
unnecessary, because you've taken processes out of the equation in a different
way ...
Greetings,
Rafael
