	Client (ie mounting)		Server(the disk itself)
Solaris has a sunsolve fix
Irix I believe is ok - certainly I had no problems
AIX - don't know, but if you see 1-4 bytes of offset corruption then take it
	up with IBM. Since they are apparently now providing a lot of Linux
	stuff Im sure they will care
