I know the drive in the laptop is ATA100 and ever since I tried to
hdparm it, it returns the error "ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4/5 is not
functional." .. Is this for something missing in the ide code? I
remember Vojtek posting a patch for Via chipsets a long time ago so it
seems as if this chipset isn't tagged as 'OK' or something?
