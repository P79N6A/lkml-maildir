CONFIG_RTNETLINK is one of those muddled options that sometimes can
be turned by a user, and sometimes turned on automatically.  This leads
to confusion and incoherent configuration values.
Andi, I would like to change the Config.in files so that nothing turns
on CONFIG_RTNETLINK automatically.  If the user selects it, then they
have access to advanced IP routing and other things that depend o nit.
If the user doesn't select it, then they don't.
What do you think?
