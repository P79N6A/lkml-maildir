That was your idea, I just said the infrastructure was in place and we
could do it ;-)
I am not so sure it is ideal. I hesitate to make kernel threads FIFO at
a maximum priority, let alone an even greater one. I would really prefer
to find a nicer solution. Anyhow, if we make events FIFO/99 that would
also solve the problem, without dipping into extra high levels.
