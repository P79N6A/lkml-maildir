Oh, for fsck sake...  Folks, it's standard-required behaviour.  Ability
to chroot() implies the ability to break out of it.  Could we please
add that (along with reference to SuS) to l-k FAQ and be done with that
nonsense?
If you are within chroot jail and capable of chroot(), you can chdir to
its root, then chroot() to subdirectory and you've got cwd outside of
your new root.  After that you can chdir all way out to original root.
Again, this is standard behaviour.  Changing it will not yield any
security improvements, so kindly give that a rest.
