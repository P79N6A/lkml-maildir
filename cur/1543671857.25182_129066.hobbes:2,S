Indeed. But whilst you're waiting, hardlink everything together, and 
patch the differences (patch knows how to break hardlinks). Make a 
script that cp -lR's the tree to another copy (normally takes < 1s), and
then remove the other arches. grep that.
cscope with prebuilt indeces on a filtered subset of the files may well do
better than grep, depending on exactly what you're doing (does 99% of it
for me). Don't use the cscope in Debian Woody, it's broken.
