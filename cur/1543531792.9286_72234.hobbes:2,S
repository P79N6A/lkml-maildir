I recently tried to rebuild the Debian boot disks, and discovered that
it consistently causes a hang at least with 2.3.99pre2 and later.  I
haven't tried it yet with earlier kernels.  The symptoms are: there is
no error message recorded, but the scripts hang sometime during
copying files into a filesystem mounted from a loop device.  Then, one
by one, other processes hang at about the time they'd cause disk
activity.  I just tried it on 2.2.14 and it made the boot disks
successfully.  Oddly, though, I can't seem to reproduce it with my own
loop FS tests, just with the Debian boot-floppies package.
Let me know if I should try to pinpoint in what version this first
occurs, or if you need more detailed config info.
