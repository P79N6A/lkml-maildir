Hm, in looking around the kernel some more, it seems that there are a
number of other places that export voltage and temperature values (ACPI
being one of the most obvious.)  It might be time to start thinking of a
single userspace library to access all of these kinds of values in a
system, instead of having to probe around different parts of the sysfs
tree by hand...
