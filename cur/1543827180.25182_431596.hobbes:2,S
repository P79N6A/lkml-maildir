You keep making "straw that broke the camel's back" type arguments
without saying why this particular straw (rather than the other
compatibility-breaking features that are already in ext3) is the one
that must not be allowed.  Is it a matter of taste, or is there some
objective threshold that extents cross?

This is also the case when you cut and paste an entire filesystem's
source code, as has been mentioned several times in this thread.
