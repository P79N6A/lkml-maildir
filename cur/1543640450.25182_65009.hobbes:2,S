It will pass in some days or weeks, but who is doing the cleaning up and
the repairs or rebuilds (not of software, but of houses, roads, rail
roads, you name it) damaged? Who is paying for all that?
It's not only Prague that has been struck, but also parts in Southern
Russia, other parts of the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria... Just grab
a good map and look where the Elbe, Danube and Molde rivers flow, to
name just three that have wreaked havoc recently.
Certainly, getting a certain *.cz computer up and running is of a
subordinate concern in Prague.
Please don't discuss this here further, but just understand that people
have bigger worries for the time being.
