eth1394 is more widely used than may be apparent.
IP over 1394 is the basis for a number of activities in the 1394 Trade Association including "IEEE1394 Bridged over Coaxial Cable" and "Isochronous IP over 1394". 
The IEEE1394 Bridged over Coaxial Cable work allows the connection of 1394 clusters in different rooms through the already installed coaxial cable and the specification work includes the definition of the transport of AV/C commands over IP. This work dovetails nicely with CEA-2027-B and the work being done by HANA.
http://www.1394ta.org/Press/2006Press/august/8.4.a.htm
The Isochronous IP over 1394 work is designed to leverage the inherent quality of service provided by 1394 with the ubiquitousness of IP and builds on IP over 1394.
The existence of eth1394 in Linux provides vendors not just with support for IP networking but may also provide a route into the new technology areas mentioned above.
I would urge that eth1394 be ported to any updated 1394 stack. It is a useful feature of Linux and it would be a shame to see it disappear.
best wishes,
Duncan
