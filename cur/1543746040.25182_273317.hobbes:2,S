Subject: Problem with linux-2.6 BK repository on BKbkits?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Just did a bk pull from bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6 and it seems to
have worked fine but I noticed the following error message:
[snip]
Applying   1 revisions to net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_CLUSTERIP.c
fk cache: insert error for johnrose@austin.ibm.com[greg]|
drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_pci.c|20210428163018
insert: File exists
Applying   1 revisions to drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_pci.c
[snip]
I don't know what that means and whether it is a problem but I thought I
would mention it as I have never seen it before...
bk -r check doesn't report any problems after the pull and another bk
pull reports nothing to pull.
$ bk version
