I'm not Christer, but I'll reply :-)
These are some strings extracted from the BIOS for EM-350A:
Award Modular BIOS v4.51PG
EM-350A Ver.B 11-21-2000
11/21/2000-GXm-Cx5530-2A434L7JC-00
Attached is a tarball with /proc/interrupts, output of "lspci -vxxx" and 
dump_irq, all taken on EM-350A.
The brigde is 5530. i.e. the one that is documented in 
http://www.national.com/ds/CS/CS5530.pdf
I also checked 
http://www.national.com/ds/CS/CS5530A.pdf,
 and it also says 
that INTA is controlled by the bits 0:3 of the register 0x5c.
