Cannot tell as I am using a 64-bit kernel without HPET. Can someone
maybe tell me which applications use HPET yet?

Cannot confirm this, both 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.9 boot OK.

Cannot confirm this, interrupts seem to be almost equally distributed
with 64-bit kernel and irqbalance running. Did you note that x86_64 does
not provide in-kernel IRQ balancing.
