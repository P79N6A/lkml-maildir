I actually did not mean these patches should be included to a git. We
have UBI git to pull from for these purposes. I basically manually split
the UBI sources to make UBI easier to review. I should have added an
"RFC" tag, apologies.

This reflects the way of my thinking. I see UBI as a set of units with
defined interfaces. So I even physically split the interface description
into files. I still think it is easier to grasp the architecture this
way.
So, it is not distinct header for _.c_ file, it is a distinct header for
each _unit_, which is a basic architecture element of UBI.
