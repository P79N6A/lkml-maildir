Likewise for disabling interrupts, we don't like that either. So
anything that requires cpu-pinning is preferably not done.
That said, we can suffer a preempt-off section if its O(1) and only a
few hundred cycles.
The trouble with all this percpu data in slub is that it also requires
pinning to the cpu in much of the slow path, either that or what we've
been doing so far with slab, a lock per cpu, and just grab one of those
locks and stick to the data belonging to that lock, regardless of
whether we get migrated.
slab-rt has these locks for all allocations and they are a massive
bottleneck for quite a few workloads, getting a fast path allocation
without using these would be most welcome.
So, if the fast path can be done with a preempt off, it might be doable
to suffer the slow path with a per cpu lock like that.
