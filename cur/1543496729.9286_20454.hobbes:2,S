  I'd suggest turning of the AT->PC keyboard scan code translation that
is being done in the keyboard controller chip.  You'll then get a different
set of scancodes,  with key releases being proceeded by 0xf0 (if I remember
correctly).
  Last time I checked all motherboards supported this,  since the keyboard
controller proms seem to be fairly standard.  However,  don't try changing
the keyboard scancode set - not all keyboards support it.
  Note - this will require rewriting the keyboard handler code.  It also
means that raw scan codes will be different,  but then I think XFree said
they were going to change to using the medium raw set anyway.
