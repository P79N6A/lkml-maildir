I have a couple of questions (I am not familiar with IBM hardware so
please bear with me...):
- Is it detected as Synaptics but does not work?
- Should it be detected as Synaptics?
- Does it work if you pass psmouse_noext=1 or psmouse_proto=bare?
  And what about psmouse_proto=imps and psmouse_proto=exps
- Does it work if you give 2.6.0-test10-mm1 a quick boot?
- dmesg, input section of you XFree and version and parameters that
  are passed to GPM.
Thank you,
Dmitry
