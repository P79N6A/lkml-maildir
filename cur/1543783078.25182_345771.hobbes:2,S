Thanks, I have just read through all of them and none of them look
like a problem.
The primary issue is that you can't count on being able to use
the upper 4 PAT entries.
The most painful is that on the Pentium-III and I believe on the Pentium-M
there are occasions where PAT will fail to promote an UC entry from
the mtrrs to WC.  The page will remain UC resulting in louzy performance.
It looks like you can hard hang a Pentium-4 by mixing uncached and
writeback memory attributes.
