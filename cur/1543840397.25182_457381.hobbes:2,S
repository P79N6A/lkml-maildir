Could you elaborate a bit more?  You mean this faking of the SATA
Control Registers?  If so, this is a bit problematic ... SAS HBAs don't
seem to come with SATA Control Registers (and certainly not when the
device is remote over SAT).  We do, however, have reasonable control of
the phys via the transport class.  Probably the best solution is to
expand the ata transport class to abstract this phy control out into
knobs users can twiddle and then put this back down to libata/libsas via
callbacks they can each interpret.
