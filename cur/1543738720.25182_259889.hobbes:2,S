I patched my kernel, and I'm still baffled: when I connect the E1000 and the
nvidia card, both of them say the link is down. The E1000 and the 3Com card
works well. The E1000 is supposed to do polarity detection, so it should
work with the nvidia card, too. ??
Not really a problem, but I find it pretty strange.
