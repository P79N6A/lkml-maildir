Hmm, the filemap_fdatawrite - fdatawait combination as a whole is responsible
for waiting for writes initiated prior to it being invoked to get to disk, 
isn't it ? 
It seems like the case Daniel is thinking about is when 
a process has issued writes to the page cache, and then filemap_fdatawrite
is called, while these pages are being written back to disk parallely by 
another thread (not holding i_sem). The filemap_fdatawrite wouldn't see
pages that are in the process of being written out by the background
thread so it doesn't mark them for writeback. The following filemap_fdatawait 
would find these pages on the locked_pages list all right, but if its
unlucky enough to be in the window that Daniel mentions where PG_dirty 
is cleared but PG_writeback hasn't yet been set, then the page would
have move to the clean list without waiting for the actual writeout
to complete !
So if this is a valid race ... then this could mean that fsync et al 
may potentially return before all prior writes have actually been 
sync'ed. In practice, possibly the sync'ing of metadata ends up waiting 
for i/o that might be ordered later in the queue, and hence effectively 
sees the data i/o completed as well.

The above reasoning applies not just to DIO but regular buffered i/o - fsync
kind of situations as well.
But since Daniel's tests failed even with the patch, maybe this isn't
the cause for the latest DIO exposures. Though that doesn't mean the race
doesn't exist.
I guess it would help to see what happens without the first (non i_sem 
protected) filemap_write_and_wait in DIO.
