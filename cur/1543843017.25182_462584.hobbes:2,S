Please see these threads and quit bringing up this topic like crazy:

So if you must cause a senseless hubbub on securityfocus.com, please  
don't spill it over onto LKML.  This sort of thing is at _worst_ a  
bug in GNU tar that it's behavior is different when root.  I run a  
linux system with SELinux where user 0 is no different than any other  
user and has no special permissions at all, and this kind of  
stupidity bites me a lot.  My user 0 is "kyle" when I want to chown  
files I switch to the "sysadm" role, or if I absolutely need to  
override security policy for some reason I jump through hoops to get  
to the "root" role.  In neither of those cases do I care what UID I am.
So either deal insecure permissions when you can't be bothered to use  
GNU tar securely (easy), don't compile your kernel as root (easier)  
or fix GNU tar not to assume UID 0 is God in the first place.
Cheers,
