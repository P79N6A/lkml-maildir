So how come I get the "RTNL: assertion failed at
devinet.c(775):inetdev_event" when I call register_netdevice without
rtnl_lock/unlock ?
could it be a 2.4.0-test9 thing ? (haven't used test10 or 11 yet).
and what about rmmod causing the panic when I use unregister_netdev or never
completing the operation when I use unregister_netdevice ?
does module_exit run inside rtnl_lock too ?

do_ioctl is inside rtnl_lock...
Remember if you need to alter the rules, you can always queue work in
the current context, and have a kernel thread handle the work.  The nice
thing about a kernel thread is that you start with a [almost] clean
state, when it comes to locks.
