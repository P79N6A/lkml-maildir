Hi all, 
(please Cc, and sorry, don't know where to cross post that one)
switching from 2.6.28-rc9 to 2.6.29-rc1 my /dev/dri/* entries got lost.
Hardware is intel GM45:
[    1.225368] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: Intel Mobile Intel® GM45 Express Chipset
[    1.230650] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: detected 65532K stolen memory
[    1.239716] PM: Adding info for No Bus:agpgart
[    1.239844] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xd0000000
[    1.240093] PM: Adding info for No Bus:tpm0
[    1.564241] [drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810
but X tells me:
(II) intel(0): Kernel reported 1264128 total, 1 used
(II) intel(0): I830CheckAvailableMemory: 5056508 kB available
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: Open failed
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: Open failed
[drm] failed to load kernel module "i915"
...
I see the post 
	[PATCH] drm/i915: why does kconfig hate?
but using that patch I still get:
	drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:8:error: found recursive dependency: DRM
-> <choice> -> DRM_I915 -> FB -> FB_I810 -> AGP -> DRM
Any chance to fix that, or some suggestion?
Best wishes
Norbert

The major difference between a thing that might go wrong
and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a
thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually
turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.
