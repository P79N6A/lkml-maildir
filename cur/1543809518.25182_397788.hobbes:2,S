Could be - we have a couple of notifier handlers in sched.c already,
although they're inside awkward CONFIG_* wrappers.
But architectures need to initialise cpu_possible_map in setup_arch()
anyway, because we immediately call setup_per_cpu_areas(), which needs to
know which CPUs are possible so it will only allocate memory for them.
Yes, architectures can override the generic setup_per_cpu_areas(), but the
same argument applies: they don't want to be allocating memory for
!possible CPUs.
So I think it's sanest to say that the arch shalt initialise cpu_possible_map
in setup_arch().
