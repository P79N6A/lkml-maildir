Yup, I hope that almost all the patches move from "patches eventually
ready for mainstream" to "patches ready for mainstream" ;-)

Good ;) but AFAIK Andrew is not publishing the "patches ready for
mainstream" (bk or collection of patches) tree.

I understand, 
I know I'm pedantic but can we all see the list of bk trees ("patches
ready for mainstream" and "patches eventually ready for mainstream")
that we'll be used by Linus ?
I'm learning a lot trying to understand the development method used by
this community,
but there are things that I don't fully understand, 
is it possible to "formalize" it (somehow) ?
Ciao and thanks!
