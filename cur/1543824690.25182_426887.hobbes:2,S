I hacked up a new version last night.
Its now based on top of David's patches, Hugh's approach of using the
MAP_PRIVATE protections instead of the MAP_SHARED seems far superior indeed.
Q: would it be feasable to do so for al shared mappings so we can remove
the MAP_SHARED protections all together?
They survive my simple testing, but esp. the msync cleanup might need some
more attention.
I post them now instead of after a little more testing because I'll not 
have much time the coming few days to do so, and hoarding them does 
nobody any good.
