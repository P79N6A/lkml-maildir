We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.20.9 kernel.
This release has a security bugfix so any users of kernels older than
2.6.20.8 that have ipv6 enabled are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon
as possible.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.8 and 2.6.20.9.
The updated 2.6.20.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
