Right, good point. I'll boot the machine nosmp and try to reproduce the
oops over the weekend.

trouble is, I have no idea whether the bug is present in earlier
2.4 kernels as well without me noticing, or if it's a relatively
new thing (Sure I could check, but it's not like I can reproduce
the oops in under an hour or so of trying: that's what I meant by
"more-or-less-deterministically" :D).
