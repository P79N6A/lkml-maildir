We just shared an experience. :-( This is what I wrote some lines
later. Will you please set the uncached areas first? And do not forget
the last echo line I wrote.

Yes, this is (4GB - whatever MB) starting at 1MB: upper 15MB of zone(0)
+ zone(1) + lower ~3GB of zone(2). The mtrr driver correctly
complains when you try to set it exactly this way because
the MTRRs base must be on size boundary. That's why I collected
the real memory areas and the should-be-uncached PCI areas.
