Subject: Unresolved symbols in smbfs and scsi (2.3.15, 2.3.16, 2.3.17, 2.3.18...)

I still keep getting 'unresolved symbols' in smbfs and scsi modules.
2.3.15, 2.3.16, 2.3.17 and 2.3.18 for sure and some earlier also:
psycho:~# depmod -a
/lib/modules/2.3.18/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.3.18/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol(s)
psycho:~# modprobe smbfs
/lib/modules/2.3.18/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol get_cached_page
psycho:~# modprobe advansys
/lib/modules/2.3.18/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol init_task_union
scsi_mod: No such file or directory
psycho:~# modprobe scsi_mod
/lib/modules/2.3.18/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol init_task_union
I include my .config as an attachment. I didn't alter Makefiles. I've
got pentium mmx, 1 processor, gcc-2.95.1 (egcs had the same problem),
glibc-2.1.
