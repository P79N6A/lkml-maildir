Thanks Bill, I have read everything I can find in the archives, but am 
still confused as to what exactly is going on. My current understanding is:
On boot, Linux examines the ide drive for physical parameters. Then, 
mounting causes filesystem details to be loaded.
Now clearly, unmounting should undo mounting (or does the kernel keep 
something even here in memory for 'efficiency?). So is hdparm -U enough 
to undo the loading of physical parameters, and will hdparm -R reload them?

This device is claimed to be 'hot-swappable'. It has circuitry on board, 
which I presume does the necessary isolation and power down as claimed 
in the blurb.
As an aside, I am puzzled by statements that Linux `doesn't support' 
this. As far as I can see (and I acknowledge my relative ignorance, 
which is why I have appealed for help here), whatever is done at boot 
time can be done again later if conditions change, and it should be just 
a matter of my ascertaining exactly what must be done to achieve this. 
Or have I missed something very important (highly possible!)?
