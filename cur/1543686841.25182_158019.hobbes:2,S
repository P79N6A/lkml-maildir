Subject: [PATCH] Backport recent 2.6 IDE updates to 2.4.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Not too long ago I submitted an IDE patch fixing
CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE.  That in turn prompted a flurry of
patches fixing a number of related IDE capacity problems.
I have backported the lot (which includes my original fix) to
2.4.x.  I believe these should be included into 2.4.x, but I
leave the final call to you.  I am running with all of these
patches in my 2.4.x kernel and everything is working nicely.
