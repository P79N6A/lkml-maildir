Neither were eg. kernel-based semaphores. So what? Unix wasnt perfect and
isnt perfect - but it was a (very) good starting point. If you are arguing
against the existence or importance of sendfile() you should re-think,
sendfile() is a unique (and important) interface because it enables moving
information between files (streams) without involving any interim
user-space memory buffer. No original Unix API did this AFAIK, so we
obviously had to add it. It's an important Linux API category.

I do think that the kiovec code has to be rewritten substantially before
it can be used for networking zero-copy, so right now we do the least
damange if we do not increase the coverage of kiovec code.

please study the networking portions of the zerocopy patch and you'll see
why this is not desirable. An alloc_kiovec()/free_kiovec() is exactly the
thing we cannot afford in a sendfile() operation. sendfile() is
lightweight, the setup times of kiovecs are not.
basically the current kiovec design does not deal with the realities of
high-speed, featherweight networking. DO NOT talk in hypotheticals. The
code is there, do it, measure it. You might not care about performance, we
do.
another, more theoretical issue is that i think the kernel should not be
littered with multi-page interfaces, we should keep the one "struct page *
at a time" interfaces. Eg. check out how the new zerocopy code generates
perfect MTU sized frames via the ->writepage() interface. No interim
container objects are necessary.
