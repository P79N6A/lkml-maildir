Yes, I know what possible benefits are. I also consider what the costs are,
and I think they are much larger than the benefits.

Though luck. Then you must redesign the kernel's guts, and a largeish part
of userspace. And recompile everything with another way of handling
devices, be it 64 bit dev_t's or some other scheme. BTW, the work for
enabling larger dev_t's has been done a long time ago (2.1 something, or
even much earlier). AFAIU, glibc is also prepared for a larger dev_t. The
big problem is doing it, as it will break _everything_.

You are just shifting one naming convention to another one, that is as bad
or worse. No win there.

OK, this is the only argument you've got left. If you won't go into it, it
surely means that it isn't really that solid. Case closed.
