And to continue the rant: the broken mount uevent feature (which
can't work right) got in without any serious review through the
driver model tree.  just as all those break udev/etc patches that
cause all these userland breakages for those people brave enough
to use udev and surrounding bits.
Folks, we need to stop breaking sysfs interface all the time.  Having
attributes on objects is real nice from many perspectives, but it's
also a burden because the internal object model is now seen by the
outside world.  That means anything involving sysfs needs a careful
design not random patching as the driver model core people appear to
do.
