Hello !
Your name and/or email address was included on one or 
more lists that I purchased from suppliers of leads. The 
people on the lists were identified as individuals who 
are SERIOUSLY interested in and agreeable to receiving information 
on business opportunities on the Internet by email. 
Experience has shown me that many people on these lists 
have not given their permission to be included and are 
not interested in receiving such information. 
The purpose of this email is to confirm that you in fact 
would like to receive information related to Work From
Home Business Opportunities and to request your 
permission to be included on an opt in business 
opportunity mailing list that I am building. 
If you would like to be included on my list and receive information 
related to home business opportunities, just send 
send a blank email with 'SUBSCRIBE'in the Subject Line.You do not have
to put anything in the message body 
unless you so desire. You will receive an email with the subject, 
"......... HOME-BIZNETWORK NEWS" 
If you wish to remove yourself or ban your email address from further 
receiving emails from our system,  send blank a email with 'REMOVE' in
the Subject line. 
Please do not alter the subject line in any way. 
Sincerely, 
Rajan Sethi
