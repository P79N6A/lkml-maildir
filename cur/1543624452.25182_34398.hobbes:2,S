	Are you talking about an event that occurred in the 2.4
tree or the 2.5 tree?  Are you saying that the newer driver in
2.4 was reverted back to the older driver (i.e., the one that
is in 2.5), or are you saying that someone made some attempt
at porting the 2.5 tree's NCR53C80 driver the new DMA mapping
interface and then backed them out?
