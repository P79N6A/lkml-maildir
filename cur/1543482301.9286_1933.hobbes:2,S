    About this geometry mess:
    Is there a reason why not to use sector addressing and avoid ALL troubles ?
    Except "backweird compatroubleity" off-course.
It will be required at least as long as there still exist people
using DOS or Windows * with the old partition types (1,4,5,6)
who want to have Linux on the same system.
