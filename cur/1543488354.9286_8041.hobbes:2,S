It's a non issue anyhow if they have gone and changed the module
interface they will now have to spend the time making their patches work
for each and every kernal version or risk being outdated.
That kind of time resource doesn't come cheaply.
I don't see how anyone can see what they have done as an advantage for
themselves cause it sucks to be them.  This is that binary module
compatabillity problem that was argued about x2 they now have to worry
about kernel module interface changes AND hope none affact their patch. 
OSS still wins you can relax now.

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
