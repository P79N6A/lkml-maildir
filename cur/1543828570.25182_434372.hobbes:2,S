Probably this is somehow my idiocy, but...
I have a Sandisk USB compact flash reader.  this 
worked with 2.6.16.11, but does not seem to work with
2.6.16.20.  Maybe a udev problem?
[root@zuul ~]# udevinfo -V
udevinfo, version 039
[root@zuul ~]# lsmod | grep usb
usb_storage            58496  0
libusual               13072  1 usb_storage
usbcore               131780  5 usb_storage,libusual,uhci_hcd,ehci_hcd
I plug the device in, and cat /proc/partitions, but
see nothing matching my usb device.
I used the .config from my working 2.6.16.11 kernel
when making the 2.6.16.20 kernel...
(did "make oldconfig" iirc.)
My userland is from Fedora core 3, mostly...
One thing that's always been a little fuzzy to me...
when updating a kernel, how do I know what userland things
need updating?  e.g. my iptables I think doesn't work any 
more, also.
Thanks for any hints.
