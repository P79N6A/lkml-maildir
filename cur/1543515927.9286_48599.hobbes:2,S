This bit me too - I added a whole directory full of new drivers, each with 
their own __initfunc sections - but because nothing explicitly referenced 
them, the whole library didn't get included in the final link. It confused the 
hell out of me :)
I eventually got round it by using O_TARGET instead of A_TARGET.
