#define IDLE_C1HALT ?
I created another one for Athlon Nforce2 to prevent lockups in apic mode.
It is proving more useful than I thought.
It has also been used on SIS740 to prevent same problem.
I know such a workaround should not be required but it works well.
It modifies C1 state idle behaviour by being a little more intelligent about
when it is worthwhile to do into disconnect and has a crude but effective
delay in case of back to back disconnect reconnect cycles.

Patch is here.

Currently it is kernel arg activated by  "idle=C1halt".

A lockup detector on Athlon systems could conceivably invoke above idle state
after a manual reboot as not all systems of the same chipset have the problem.
