Would it be possible to come up with something common between this primitive
and the one that Oleg Nesterov put together for Jens Axboe?

Oleg's approach acquires a lock on the update side, which Peter would
not want in the uncontended case -- but perhaps there is some way to
make Oleg's approach be able to safely test both counters so as to
avoid acquiring the lock if there are no readers.
Oleg, any chance of this working?  I believe it does, but have not
thought it through fully.
If it does turn out that we cannot converge these, I believe that
Peter's implementation needs an smp_mb() at both the beginning
and the end of barrier_sync().  Without the first smp_mb(), the
test in barrier_sync() might precede the prior change, and without
the second smp_mb() the barrier_sync() might slide after the following
cleanup code.  (But I could easily be misunderstanding the code
using barrier_sync().)
							Thanx, Paul
