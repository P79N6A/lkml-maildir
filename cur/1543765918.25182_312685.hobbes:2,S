Thanks.
A few small comments below.

                                         ^^^^^^^            ^
                 is this cast really nessesary ?      No space there.

Same comments for the rest of it. There seems to be a lot of unneeded 
casts (I could be wrong, but I don't see the need for them, and if they 
are not needed all they do is mask potential type errors). And the 
whitespace thing also goes for the rest, don't put extra spaces after the 
opening parenthesis and before the closing one in function calls.
