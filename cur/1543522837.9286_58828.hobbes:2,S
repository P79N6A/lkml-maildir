I'm in office now and here I've the patch coded for 2.3.5.
Anyway this weekend I've planned to port my scheduler into 2.2.14 and 2.3.39
and to post on linux-kernel sunday evening or monday morning ( Europe
Time ).
This patch also include a semaphore patch that avoid releasing all tasks in
a wait queue
selecting the best inside wake_up().
Cheers,
    Davide.
