Hi Dmitri,
There are 3 "fix" patches after this one (sorry about that).
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120941725114635&w=4
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120949583029044&w=4

Checking out the "latest" sched/latest it appears though that the
entire patchset has been removed.  I'll wait for Ingo's feedback
on what's up.
I will also try out your example test.
Thanks,
Mike
