I have a no-name motherboard, the driver complains that the controller is
not 100% PCI compliant but I am not using the IDE at all since the system
is all SCSI. I do not know if it will properly share an IRQ since I do not
have any IDE drives here at home to test it with.
I suppose I could drag it into the lab to test it. The only marking I can
find on the board is:
MS5120 VER:1
It uses a PIIX controller that complains on bootup about not being 100%
PCI.
