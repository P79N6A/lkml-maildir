I'm not sure this would work for the extattr/lextattr variants where
we don't have an fd to hold the state.  Should the list operation
be restricted to the fextattr variant, perhaps?  I'm not sure about
all the implications of that, will have to see what everyone else
thinks I guess.
eg. the opening of the file before allowing a list operation could
have implications for XFSs DMAPI support (open might recall data from
tape), where the management tools need to be able to list these DMAPI
related attributes without affecting the backing storage, I believe -
I'll have to ask some DMAPI gurus about that one though.
Thanks for the input.
cheers.
