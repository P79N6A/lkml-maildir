I guess the patch being discussed could still save some time for people who
try or debug a new kernel and find that certain module crashes it. Yes it
is possible to boot to old kernel, then blacklist something, then
regenerate initramfs, etc etc, and then undo all that.
Compared to that, adding a boot arg to kernel being debugged is *much* more
convinient.
Just my 2c.
