This is a laptop.  The video chipset is Neomagic 2160.  The problem
reappeared with a reboot but disappeared when I went back to 2.2.16.
I've built 2.2.17 for it but haven't gotten around to rebooting it to

There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and
any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to
run a heat engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.
This is obviously impossible.
