The callback mutex (which is what container_lock() actually locks) is
also used to synchronize fork/exit against subsystem additions, in the
event that some subsystem has registered fork or exit callbacks. We
could probably have a separate subsystem_mutex for that instead.
Apart from that, yes, it may well be possible to move callback lock
entirely inside cpusets.
