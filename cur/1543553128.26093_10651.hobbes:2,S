  In my quota fix this has changed a bit as now filesystem's notify_change()
is calling dquot_transfer() (it was needed due to some races and I think it's
also more consistent with how other quota calls work). So this problem
should exist no more.

  Actually I was proposing something similar in my reaction on dquot hang in
ext3... The only difference was that I proposed to install dq_ops in
foo_read_super() so that it will be more consistent with how other callbacks
work. And in my fix of quota I removed testing of dq_ops being NULL so
operations can be set during all life (mount time) of filesystem.
