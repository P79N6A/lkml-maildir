Both ways work, this is down to nitpicking for the sake of
nitpicking. Whatever, I'll change it.

Your approach doesn't work. This relies on first-touch to get
performance, remap_pfn_range_node wouldn't work.

mspec_alloc_page can be called from anywhere by anyone who wants to
allocate an uncached page. The old fetchop driver just took the
uncached memory and kept to itself. Thats what I am talking about!
Earlier versions of the patch has already been by the ia64 list, we're
down to details here.

It's you! I seems you're forgetting to do the real research before
trying to shoot something down ;-)
Cheers,
