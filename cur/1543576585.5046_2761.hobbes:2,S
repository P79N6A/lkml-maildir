I applied test13-pre4-ac2 here, and it applied cleanly.
Are you applying it to a clean tree?  Are your using
patch v2.5.4 ?   (that's the version I have)
FWIW, I was getting smp.c patch failures (well, it said the
patch was previously applied) along with a bunch of
IPTables stuff -- that was a couple of -ac's ago.
AC1 and AC2 applied cleanly, tho AC1 wouldnt compile
uniprocessor/no-quotas unless you added a 
#include <linux/smp_lock.h> to fs/ext2/balloc.c
(i.e. it left some hanging refs to lock_kernel and
unlock_kernel in fs.o,  and I think there was also
one in the UDF module.    It's fixed in -ac2.
