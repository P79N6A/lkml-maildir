Thats cute.. unfortunately, that's what just happened to my linux
server.  (It went sky high, 400-odd entries in /lost+found after a
corrupted ext3 superblock.  Oh, and most of /etc (at least) was
corrupted with binary garbage.  Linux tends to get annoyed when
/etc/group is nothing but 8bit noise...)
If I can reproduce it on something slightly less 'weird' (read: heavily
patched and completely untested) than the Gentoo kernels I'll post bug
reports.  But in the meantime, recovery continues ... :(
