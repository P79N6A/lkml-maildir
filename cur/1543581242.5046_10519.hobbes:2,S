 Your point is right -- the problem are not undefined MSRs (that raise
#GP(0) on an access) but undocumented ones, sigh...

 Intel is actually sane -- you get #GP(0) for this MSR on P5.  Others
might not and there are less cluefull vendors out there.

 Yes, there are more problems as well.  I'm working on it -- you may want
to look at the preliminary patch I sent here on Monday (strangely enough,
nobody out of linux-kernel seemed to be interested so far).  Next version
should be available later this week -- the main problem with moving
identify_cpu() earlier are other cpu_data fields that get initialized
later, so more code needs to be actually rewritten.

 You see.  I'm going to move identify_cpu() very early anyway, but this
need a careful code review.
