<pre>Is there a good list of changes / new features in upcoming 2.4 kernel
release?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Will 2.4 have 2(4)+GB filesize support on 32bit machines?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Will 2.4 have 32bit uid/gid support?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Will 2.4 have Nfsv3 support?
Thanks for your help.

<p><br>I think the large file support is pretty important especially in
video work, however, there isn't much software to support anything like
that, and if there were, I'm a bit concerned about synchronization with
standard media timings such as SMPTE time code and such.&nbsp; The regualr
30/60 frames and quarter frames lead to timings that don't divide well
with the regular 100Hz clock.&nbsp; A 300Hz clock will give nice round
25,30, and 60 frame timings, but regular quater frames, I&nbsp;_THINK_
end up being 120hz, which doesn't grok at all nicely with 100Hz, and not
well with 300Hz much better.
<p>Is there some specific reason the kernel uses 100Hz?&nbsp; Would it
be more advantageous to go to a 600Hz clock for synchronization with professional
media production and other real time capabilities?
<p>In all, I don't care if NONE of the nice features make it into 2.4,
as long as the stuff that is currently there is stable again.
