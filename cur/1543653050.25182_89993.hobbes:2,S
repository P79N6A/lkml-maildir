Definitely agreed on the usefulness of LAN console. Being able to just
run netcat for all the boxes in your datacenter is a huge win. Cuts
your cable count by a third to a half and eliminates a bunch of term
servers and KVMs.
Other folks have pointed out that the GDB stub protocol includes
checksumming and retries up at the 'application' layer so we don't
actually have to worry about it.
