I doubt the "extension" works this way since most of the interesting 
cases are with tristates.
But OK, here's some fun with bools:
config X86
	def_bool y
config A
	bool "a"
config B
	bool "b"
	depends on A
config D
	bool "d"
	depends on !B if X86
config E
	bool "e"
config C
	bool "c"
	depends on D || E
	requires B
Given:
- CONFIG_A=y
- CONFIG_B=n
- CONFIG_D=y
- CONFIG_E=n
Will C be visible?
