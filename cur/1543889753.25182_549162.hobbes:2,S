Since I wrote them up in IRC, I might as well post them here and get it 
archived:
We need to figure out a better polling solution.
For SAS and advanced SATA, polling really has no meaning at all, when 
you consider what polling IDENTIFY DEVICE and polling SET FEATURES are 
trying to solve.  To the advanced hardware, it's all a bunch of packets. 
  An event that appears "late" to the eyes of the PATA world is now 
presented as changing data fields in the packet stream.
We are going to have to deal with the HSM issue underlying the need to 
do SET FEATURES - XFER MODE polling, and ultimately IDENTIFY DEVICE 
polling too.
This is the main reason why I have resisted applying "[PATCH] libata: 
always use polling SETXFER" -- polling implies a model that does not 
exist on SAS/SATA and advanced SATA.  It's only luck that AHCI includes 
a real register to poll.
To illustrate:  Fixing this problem The Right Way(tm) will yield a 
result that would allow ahci.c to operate in an interrupt-driven mode, 
examining the contents of the FIS's returned. Polling status can already 
be replaced by examining the D2H and SDB FIS areas.
And by definition, on AHCI (and sata_sil24, IIRC) the status will not 
change unless a new FIS has arrived.
Polling is still fine on PCI IDE-like controllers (older ones), but 
advanced controllers require us to coalesce the polling bandaid into a 
test for a sequence of events.
We cannot escape the "hard part."  :)
