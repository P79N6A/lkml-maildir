Not my area at all, but this looks really dodgy to me, Paul:
could you explain it further?
First off, I don't see what's "RCU" about it at all.  Essentially,
you're replacing read_lock(&tasklist_lock) by preempt_disable(),
but calling it by the fancier rcu_read_lock() alias.  I thought there
would need to be some more infrastructure to make this RCU and safe?
