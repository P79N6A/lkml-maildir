Yes, this is an old oddity.

... and locking/complications. The creator may already exited at this time.

can't understand this, sorry.
Ingo, I think sched_exit() has another buglet,
	if (unlikely(p->parent->time_slice > task_timeslice(p)))
		p->parent->time_slice = task_timeslice(p);
should be
	if (unlikely(parent->time_slice > task_timeslice(parent)))
		parent->time_slice = task_timeslice(parent);
The
	[PATCH 1/2] sched_exit: fix parent->time_slice calculation
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=115101842505365
was dropped because "[PATCH 2/2]" was very wrong.
Could you look at it?
Oleg.
