So you just pointed to *another* data structure that apparently violates 
the "you MUST use refcounting" rule.
What is it with you people? It's really simple. Data structures must be 
refcounted if you can reach them two different ways.
If you don't use refcounting, then you'd better make sure that the data 
can be reached only one way (for example, by *not* exposing it for sysfs).
It really *is* that simple. Read the CodingStyle rules.
