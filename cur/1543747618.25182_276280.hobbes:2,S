I agree, but the current situation made me drive 150km, because sshd or
even init was killed.
I hit this problem, when a forking server application got out of control
because there were suddenly connecting hundreds of clients due to a
different problem.
As long as I can log into the machine and fix the crap it's ok. There's
no need for anything else than accessability and a half way
deterministic behaviour.
