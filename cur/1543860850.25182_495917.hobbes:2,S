By crash I mean the whole system going down, having to reset the entire 
machine.
I'm sending you 4 files:
dmesg: current boot dmesg, just a boot, because no errors appeared after 
last crash, since the server is out of production right now (errors 
usually appear under heavy load, and this primarily a transparent proxy 
for about 1000 simultaneous users)
lspci: the way you asked for it
messages and messages.1: files where you can see old boots and crashes 
(even a soft lockup).
If there is anything else I can do, let me know. If you need direct 
access to the server, I can arrange that too.
Thanks.
Pablo.
