Yep.
 - OO != C++. It's a style of programming and while you can do OO in C++
   you can easily do it in other languages (or do non-OO in C++, indeed)
 - A _lot_ of the kernel code/design is inherently object-oriented. So
   pardon our collective scepticism when YAC++Advocate comes along waving
   the "OO ergo C++" underw^Wflag
