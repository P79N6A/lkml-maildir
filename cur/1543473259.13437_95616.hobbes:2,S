Note that "unset" _really_ should be supported by xconfig: it's something
that has been used by other architectures for at least a year, and I'm
surprised xconfig doesn't do it.
The reason it is needed is that the shell-based configs just "include" the
old config, and as such anything that is not set directly has to be unset
in order for it to have a clean slate.
In the case of CONFIG_PCI_BIOS/CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT this probably doesn't
matter, as the scripts themselves do not test the values, and only in that
case is "unset" actually needed, but look into CONFIG_PCI on
arch/alpha/config.in or arch/mips/config.in to see why there are good and
valid reasons why "unset" should be there and work. 
Michael, for xconfig "unset" is probably a no-op, could you just make
xconfig silently accept it?
The -n -> == "y" part of this diff looks fine, no reason to not do that
part.
