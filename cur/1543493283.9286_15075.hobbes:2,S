Six HWIF's is the magic number or 12 devices.
It can be clearly seen that we could do 8/16, but......
You need to reqest a pair of majors and approval from Linus if you want
Eight or more HWIF's.
Three Ultra33's with function with a limit.
The Ultra66 is working now but test limits are to ATA-33.
No ATA-66 drives in hand.
