Hello,
I don't know whether that's the right list for this question, but I'll ask
anyhow.
I've just received a Dell PowerEdge 1300, and I've decided to install one
kernel-2.0 partition and one kernel-2.2 partition in the same HD. As the
HD has 4.5GB, I splitted it into 2.1GB / 2.1GB / 149MB (swap).
Well, first partition boots fine, second partition can't boot (LILO just
shows "Loading 2" and that's it).
How can I solve this ?? Will I have to repartition the HD ?? IS it
impossibile to have the system working using the aforementioned partition
scheme ??
Thanks in advance for your attention.
Regards,
Ivan
