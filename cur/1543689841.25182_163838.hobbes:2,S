Ehh, what's wrong with the obvious approach: declare a dummy variable. If 
it's not a type, then the declaration won't work.
Ie, change the (sizeof(x)) to something like
	({ x __dummy; sizeof(__dummy); })
which should work with all compiler versions.
Anything that requires a new compiler is always a big dodgy as a sanity 
check. People who don't have the new compiler won't be testing it, so 
they'll just continually break it for people who _do_. Aggravation 
nightmare.
