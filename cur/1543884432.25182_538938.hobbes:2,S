I believe that the powerpc behavior was established before
cpu_present_map was introduced.

powerpc also supports processor add and remove (as opposed to
online/offline); i386 does not AFAIK.  I think this may be a reason
for the difference.

Working as intended.  You have to add a cpu to the partition before
you can online it.

I think it's the inevitable result when architectures are free to
invent their own versions of the same sysfs interface.  But is it
really causing a problem in this case?
