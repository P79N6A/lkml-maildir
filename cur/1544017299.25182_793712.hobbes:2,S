Not strictly true. The apicids in the ACPI tables are always globally unique
across the entire system. Because of the size of UV systems, UV needs 16 bit
apicids. This fits in the ACPI apicid id/eid fields.
The actual processor apicid register is unfortunately only 11 bits and there are
some restrictions on the actual values loaded into the apicid register.
If we can put unique ids into the apicid register, we do. If we
can't, the function that reads the apicid will automatically supply the rest
of the bits.  Most of the kernel is unaware that the processor apicid
register may have only a subset of the bits that are in the ACPI tables.
