Not sure Avi what you mean but as far as I know Alexander is working on
this file so he need just time to finish (we all have other duties you know :).
So I think the idea Peter proposed could be merged right after Alexander
will have finished. At least the Peter's suggestion was recorded in this
thread which means it will *not* be lost eventually. Or you meant something
else (yep, I could have it translated plain wrong)?
