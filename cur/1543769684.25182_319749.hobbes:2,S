No, the bug is in Richard's assuming that because he can read it back in means
that it's in the screen buffer.  In fact, it only means he wrote it into some
memory location that he can read back in. ;)
Now if he added a description that verified that a read *from the screen buffer*
(rather than "from where he wrote") shows his changes, *then* he'd have something...
