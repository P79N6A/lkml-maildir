i have two x64 boxes which i tested with S* -VP and i also did a quick
testboot of -T3 on one of them but YMMV. (There's one caveat: latency
tracing must not be enabled, x64 gcc has a nastiness that makes -pg
unusable for tracing purposes on x64.)
-T4 and upwards will likely not even compile on x64 - i'll fix it up
once the rate of PREEMPT_REALTIME changes calms down.
