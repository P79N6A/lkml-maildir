Andrew,
I reran DBT-2 to with ext2 and ext3 (in case you were still interested)
on my 4-way Xeon system with 60+ drives:

Aside from the from the drop you're already aware of since 2.6.3, it
looks like DBT-2 takes another smaller hit after 2.6.5-rc3-mm2.  Here's
a brief summary from the link above:
Linux 2.6.5-rc3-mm4  Metric (bigger is better)
ext2                 1570
ext3                 1528
Linux 2.6.5-rc3-mm3  Metric (bigger is better)
ext2                 1555
ext3                 1552
Linux 2.6.5-rc3-mm2  Metric (bigger is better)
ext2                 1637
ext3                 1605
Linux 2.6.3          Metric (bigger is better)
ext2                 2292
ext3                 2080
