Wrong. Passing "events" or "information" to cpufreq governors by
cpufreq_governor() is much easier, cheaper, and more reliable.

Wrong again. CPUfreq has been rearchitectured to do this kernel-space. 
The userspace governor allows setting to specific frequencies by the user
["I _want_ 500 MHz and nothing else!"], and it offers backwards
compatibility for the first-era cpufreq interface [LART project etc.].

However, frequency scaling is much more efficient on lowering the CPU heat,
too.

Yes indeed. She wants to set a cpufreq policy which suits of her needs: 
it consists of a
- minimum frequency	=> not too low [she's plugged in]
- maximum frequency	=> 100%
- cpufreq governor	=> some kind of yet-to-be-written

_I_ wouldn't want to run this governor, though -- I want kernel compiles to
complete as fast as possible. So, we need different in-kernel governors.

Well, the thing one of the cpufreq userspace programs does is really fine:
based on low-frequency events [power plug-in, running specific programs,
etc.] different cpufreq policies [see above] are selected. No XML file
necessary.
