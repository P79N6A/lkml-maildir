Two options:
1. The dentry of the default file.
   A flag is set on the filp.
   Most operations act on the default file's dentry, but readdir and
   lseek check the filp flag to consider acting on the default file
   dentry's _parent_.
   For this reason, the default file may not be a symbolic link.
2. The filp has two dentries.
   Most operations use the usual one, but readdir uses the other, and
   lseek knows to operate on both if they are different.
   Has no limitation w.r.t. symbolic links, but uses a bit more space in
   filps.
Hey, this is too easy :-)
