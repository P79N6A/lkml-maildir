Subject: [Patch] Fix sched make domain setup overridable

Builds of 2.6.9-rc1-mm5 ia64 NUMA configs fail, with many
complaints that SD_NODE_INIT is defined twice, in asm/processor.h
and linux/sched.h.
I guess that the preprocessor conditionals were wrong when Nick
added the per-arch override ability again of SD_NODE_INIT were wrong.
At least this change lets me rebuild ia64 again.
Someone with more clues in this than I should check this.
