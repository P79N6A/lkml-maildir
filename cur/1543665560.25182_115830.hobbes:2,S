Subject: deadlock in 2.5.64 ppp?

With 2.5.64 vm I need to reboot my machines after a few days.
My laptop works fine, my server/gateway deadlocks when the
shutdown kills several processes.
The gateway has an older processor (p2 vs. p3), some additional
netfilter stuff, ipv6 support (unused), and ppp with pppoe
and a different network card (rtl8139). So I guess it might
be the pppoe stuff causing the trouble.
How can I find out more about it? ctrl-sysreq lists
all processes and several are in __down stuff. Would it
be usefull to write down that notes and mail it to l-k?
Or is it possible to dump that to a file?
