atomic_add_unless() - will nicely do, thanks.

It was indeed called too often it seems, once when deciding to drop the
skb
and again then actually freeing the skb.

Changed it to only dec_not_zero on free for IFF_MEMALLOC devices.
I'm thinking of making kfree_skbmem -> skb_release_data return whether
they
released the actual data and also depend on that.

struct sk_buff::memalloc
However the idea is that freeing non memalloc skbs also returns memory
(albeit
to the slab and not the free page list).

Yes

See previous comment.

That would put the atomic op on the free path unconditionally, I think
davem
gets nightmares from that.
Thanks
