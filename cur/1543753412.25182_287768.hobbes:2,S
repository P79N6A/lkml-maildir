It would be pretty easy to do.
The x86-64 ABI actually includes unwind data (without other dwarf
data) by default in all executables. However it wasn't needed in the
kernel so far so I turned it off to save some disk space:
If you want it without -g just remove the 
ifneq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO),y)
CFLAGS += -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
endif
in arch/x86_64/Makefile. Then to actually use it in the running kernel
you would need to change the unwind segment in the vmlinux.lds.S
to be loaded instead of discarded at link time (one liner change too)
And something to map it for modules (i haven't looked at that, but 
I suppose if ia64 has the infrastructure it shouldn't be hard to port)
I wouldn't be opposed to a new CONFIG_RUNTIME_UNWIND that does all
this. However without an working unwinder in kernel it's not very useful.

This is no different from stack based parameters where the stack slot
of the parameter can be overwritten by the callee too.
You just will have to live with that.
