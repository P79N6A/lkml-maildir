Thankfully I missed something as the test app shows
static char foo[5]="GOOD";
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  lseek(1, (unsigned long) foo, 0);
  if(write(1, "BAD!", 4) != 4)
    perror("write");
  write(2, foo, 4);
}
Running ./a.out >/proc/self/mem produces the desired write error still
in 2.6.10
