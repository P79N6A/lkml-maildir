If I read this right, your complaint is not with preemption but with
scheduler policy.  Clearly both are needed to "assure liveness". 
Another way of looking at preemption is that is enables a more
responsive and nimble scheduler policy (afterall it is the scheduler
that decided that task A should give way to task B.  All preemption does
is to allow that to happen with greater dispatch.)  Given that, we can
then discuss what scheduler policy should be.
