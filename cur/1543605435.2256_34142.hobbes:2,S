  This option enables NIC (Network Interface Card) hardware throttling
  during periods of extremal congestion. At the moment only a couple
  of device drivers support it (really only one -- tulip, a modified
  8390 driver can be found at
  
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/fastroute/fastroute-8390.tar.gz
 ). 
  Really, this option is applicable to any machine attached to a fast
  enough network, and even a 10 Mb NIC is able to kill a not very slow
  box, such as a 120MHz Pentium.
  However, do not say Y here if you did not experience any serious
  problems.
This doesn't look too incouraging.  Until I read the whole 150+ message
thread about IRQ throtling, I thought it had something to do with ethernet
bridging at high load.
I'm not surprised that this option has been overlooked.
I think the Configure.help message should be something like:
This option enables NIC (Network Interface Card) hardware throttling
during periods high load. 
Without this option, a fast NIC, fast network, and a slow computer can get
enough pp/s (packets per second) to provide an effective DoS attack.  (This
has been reported to be possible with a 10Mbps ethernet NIC on a Pentium
120Mhz)
At the moment only a few device drivers support it (At the moment, only
tulip, and  a modified 8390 - specifically NE2000/1000 - driver that can be
found at 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/fastroute/fastroute-8390.tar.gz
).
Hopefully more drivers will support this feature soon.
=================
I took a look at fastroute-8390.tar.gz, and it seems to be a driver written
by Donald Becker from way back in '94.  If so, it's probably 2.2 only, and
should be taken out of the 2.4 documentation.
