Not too sure what you mean. If we've swapped out the pages, it is
because we need the memory for something else. So no.
One thing you could do is re read swapped pages when you have
plenty of free memory and the disks are idle.

updatedb really wants to be able to provide better hints to the VM
that it is never going to use these pages again. I hate to cater for
the worst possible case that only happens because everyone has it as
a 2am cron job.
