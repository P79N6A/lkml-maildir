Are you able to plug any PS/2 devices into the machine, see if that makes a
difference?
Also it would be useful to add the option "initcall_debug" to the kernel
boot command line.  Then you will see a bunch of messages of the form
	calling initcall 0xNNNNNNNN
Please look up the final address in the System.map file from the 2.6 build.
This will give us an idea of what the machine was trying to do when it
died.
