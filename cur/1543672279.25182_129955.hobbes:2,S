Yes, the diff would be useful in many cases.  I'll shoot for this by the
next kernel drop.
In the mean time, you can do your own diffs of changes you are
interested in.  The last link in the table (the Files tab) will give you
a list of files that are logs of the modules that have warnings or
errors.  For instance, warnings/errors for the md module would be in
2.5.69.log.md.txt.
Cheers,
John
