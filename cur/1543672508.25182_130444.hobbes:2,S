Clearly, this statement in sys_accept is false:
	/*
	 * We don't need try_module_get here, as the listening socket (sock)
	 * has the protocol module (sock->ops->owner) held.
	 */
	__module_get(sock->ops->owner);
Now, the question is, when is this not true?  sock_create certainly
seems to grab a reference count to sock->ops->owner.  Maybe a
refcounting bug elsewhere?
