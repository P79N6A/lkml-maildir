i was told that there was a bug in the ali driver where when i try to
use direct rendoring with my radeon 7500 it brings my ENTIRE system to a
crashing halt. (requiring a power cycle/reset) i was told that since
most new motherboards don't come with ali that this was never going to
be fixed. is this true? or is there a workaround of some sort? Thanks!
