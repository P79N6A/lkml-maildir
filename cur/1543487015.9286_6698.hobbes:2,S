Hello...
	Just got this compile errror in the 2.2.2 kernel compiling loop.o:
/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h: In function `sk_filter':
In file included from loopback.c:51:
/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h:796: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h:796: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type

/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h:811: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h: In function `sk_filter_charge':
/mnt2/src/linux-2.2.2/include/net/sock.h:817: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
make[3]: *** [loopback.o] Error 1
	The code is in sock.h and is #ifdef'ed under CONFIG_FILTER.  A
kernel I build without CONFIG_FILTER compiled fine.  The one enabling it
blew the compile error in loop.o.
	Regards,
	Mike
