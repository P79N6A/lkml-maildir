So does sending the whole huge file without compression. The advantage
of zip is that both relevant files can be put in one archive, and that
both archive and per-file comments can be added to make it clear what
each does. I could have done a compressed tar and an explanation, but
then you have to uncompress it to read the explanation.
I didn't pick that without thinking about it, and it seems at least as
useful as anything else which comes to mind, like multiple attachments.
