There are large IDE updates in -mm4, and this is consistent with
a disk which isn't doing DMA any more.  Could you (and Con) please
double-check with `hdparm -i' and `hdparm -t' that the disk subsystem
is behaving properly?
Yes, it could well be a VM bug, but I wouldn't want to run round in
confused circles all day ;)  Thanks.

2.5 is much more swaphappy than 2.4.  I believe that this is actually
correct behaviour for optimum throughput.  But it just happens that
people (me included) hate it.  We don't notice the improved runtimes
for the pagecache-intensive operations but we do notice the time it
takes to get the xterms working again.
We have not yet sat down and worked out what to do about this.

Yeah, sorry.  The burden of back-compatibility weighed too heavy and
Rik decided that we just have to fix userspace to follow kernel
changes.  There will be breakage for a while;  updates are at
http://surriel.com/procps/.
Unfortunately, those updates cause odd-but-not-serious things to
happen to Red Hat initscripts.  This happens when you install standard
util-linux as well.  It is due to the initscripts passing in arguments
which the standard tools do not understand.
