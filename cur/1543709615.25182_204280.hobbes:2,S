if the timer softirq doesn't run and wall_jiffies doesn't increase, we
won't be able to account for it, so time() will return a time in the
past, it will potentially go backwards precisely 1/HZ seconds every tick
that isn't executing the timer softirq. I tend to agree for a 1sec
resultion that's not a big deal though if you run:
	gettimeofday()
	time()
gettimeofday may say the time of the day is 17:39:10 and time may tell
17:39:09
