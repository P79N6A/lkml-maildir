Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
mm/fremap.c(104): remark #593: variable "pte_val" was set but never used
The source code is
    pte_t pte_val;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
