Hi !
For some reason I only got some of your patches... care to resend the
whole serie with me on CC ?
We need to add similar attributes for PowerPC to support relaxed
ordering on some mappings. We started internally adding flags to the
direction, like you initially did, but it looks like that's not the
direction the wind is blowing so ..
Cheers,
Ben.
