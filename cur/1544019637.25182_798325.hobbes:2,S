DEFAULT_SEEKS * 16 is probably not best. 10 or 20 probably works just
as well. I don't remember what values I tried, but at some point
lowmem_shrink did not get called often enough to be effective.

I never expected it to be merged. I wrote it to allow us to ship a product.

This patch solves two problems for us:
1. It gives us more control over which process gets killed when we run
out of memory. This can easily be fixed in the regular oom killer
instead.
2. It prevents the system from getting unusable due to excessive
demand paging. Before we added the low memory killer, we had devices
stuck for many minutes before the system managed to allocate enough
memory for the oom killer to kick in.
The second problem is the most critical and if it is solved, we will
not need this patch.

The first level page table on arm needs four contiguous pages. This is
enough to trigger this problem. I suspect the lack of swap makes this
problem much more apparent.

It only kills one process at a time, and only if the amount of memory
available is below the selected threshold. The number returned is a
very rough estimate of how much memory can be freed. The old code used
the sum of rss for the killable processes which is not accurate
either.
