My understanding is that this works because in Ralf's original patch
(which is the context in which he is removing the flush_cache_mm()
call), he uses kmap()/kunmap() to map the page(s) being accessed at a
kernel virtual address which will fall into the same cache color as
the user virtual address --> no alias problems.
Since he does this for every page touched on the kernel side during
dup_mmap(), the existing flush_cache_mm() call in dup_mmap() does in
fact become redundant.
