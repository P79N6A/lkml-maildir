If at this time 2.8 was already released, the 2.8 kernel available at 
this time will be roughly what 2.6 would have been under the current 
development model, and 2.6 will be a rock stable kernel.
If it was possible to get the 2.7 cycle pretty short, this would give 
the advantages of the old development model without most of its' 
disadvantages.
