I like the idea of a centralized database, split up by subsystem, that's
maintained by the developers in a similar way to the ALSA soundcard
matrix.  If a user finds an inaccuracy in the soundcard matrix or
discovers a new hardware model that works they submit a bug report
against the soundcard matrix, ideally containing a patch against the
XML.
It HAS to live alongside the code in the same version control system as
the code itself so it won't drift.
