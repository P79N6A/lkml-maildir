Even with the "quiet" command line option I still get those annoying
"Unknown bridge resource 0: assuming transparent" messages from teh kernel at boot up.  I downloaded the latest pci.ids and recompiled, but it did'nt cure any of my woes.  Any ideas?  I mean, besides commenting out those printk's in pci.c =)
