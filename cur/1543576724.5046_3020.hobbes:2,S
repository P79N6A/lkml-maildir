 Ralf, could you please provide me a copy of a man page for the call?  I
don't have access to either of the systems and a search of the Net

 For SMP there is a simple kernel solution available.  It suitable for a
syscall or a ll/sc emulation.  There is no easy userland-only solution
AFAIK.

would break consistency.
