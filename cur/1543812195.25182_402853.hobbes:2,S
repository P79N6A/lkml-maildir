Agreed.

No. The driver just wants to ignore those BARs regardless of whether
they have been programmed or not.

It does give the OS the opportunity to "recycle" the I/O Port resources
at pci_enable_device() time. But this patch doesn't try to do that.

*nod*. Have pci resource allocation take place at any time *after*
the PCI bus walks has it's own set of challenges. In particular,
changing bridge windows or reassigning value to devices which
have already been enabled. Dealing with PCI quirks is another
can of worms.

Since the changes are primarily to generic PCI code,
how is this not uniform across arches?
Or am I thinking about this the wrong way?
thanks,
