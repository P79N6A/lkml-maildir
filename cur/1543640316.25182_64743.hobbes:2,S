I'm not familiar with Cerebus, but I'm willing to pitch in with any 
testing you feel necessary.  I just finished rebuilding my system with 
removable hard drives, originally to beat against Martin's IDE code.  I 
now have a known good stable system I can do production with as well as a 
dev drive I can restore to pristine in about 15 minutes.  System is an 
Athlon 1.3 GHz on Asus A7V with 384MB RAM.
Is it going to be more desireable to beat on 2.4 IDE or 2.5 IDE?
