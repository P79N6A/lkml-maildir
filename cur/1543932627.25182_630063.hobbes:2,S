From there on nothing gets printed. I did some debugging and found that prints of user land programs are not coming to the serial console, while kernel prints are working fine. I found all the programs getting executed, by placing a printk in execve routine and printing the arguments.

I placed a printk in drivers/char/tty_io.c:tty_write() and it is not getting called from my file system. I tried the same thing on my good system (say regular PC) and it works as expected.
