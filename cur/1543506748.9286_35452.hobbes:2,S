Good day, all,
	My 2.3.15 pre3 wouldn't compile:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.15/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fn
o-strength-reduce  -DCPU=586 -march=i586   -c -o filemap.o filemap.c
filemap.c: In function `filemap_nopage':
filemap.c:1408: `error' undeclared (first use in this function)
filemap.c:1408: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
filemap.c:1408: for each function it appears in.)
filemap.c:1423: warning: label `no_page' defined but not used
filemap.c:1419: warning: label `failure' defined but not used
	Defining "error" as an int seemed to allow it to compile and it's
running now without any visible problems.  It applies over 2.3.15-pre3.
	Warning: use at your own risk - this falls in the category of
PIPFPWRSBPKA *.  Cheers,
	- Bill
