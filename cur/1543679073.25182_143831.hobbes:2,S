As a bug reporter, and as someone who receives bug reports, I can say
that on both ends I find it easier to send emails, and get emails than
to fiddle with any bug tracking tool.
I'm with Dave on this one. Scrap the nifty tools, and just use good
sense. Emails let each developer handle bug reports in their own way.
I'm sure you could make a nice local tool for yourself to manage your
own bug reports.
