Actually the cleanest solution would be when I change the code in such a 
way that pb_fnmode parameter would be passed to hid instead of usbhid 
module, as this is where the input mapping is being done (you could 
potentially have a keyboard which needs the very same handling of fn mode 
as usb powerbook keyboards currently have, but on different transport
- input mapping is logically transport independent).
But I guess you will be not OK with breaking the backward compatibility in 
such way, because all the already existing tutorials, etc. right? 
Would warning that would trigger when the module parameter is passed to 
usbhid and would instruct user to pass the parameter to hid module 
instead, be acceptable? (and then changing the parameter of hid module 
through sysfs would work as expected again).
Thanks,
