Sorry! :-)

That marker_probe_register call would need to be done only when the
embedded (k_p_p_s_s) marker is actually being used.  Otherwise we'd
lose all the savings of a dormant sched.c marker by always calling
into pretty_print_sched_switch(), whether or not the k_p_p_s_s marker
was active.
In any case, if the naive tracer agrees to become educated about some
of these markers in the form of intermediary functions like that, they
need not insist on a second hop through marker territory anyway:
 static void pretty_print_sched_switch(const struct marker *mdata,
 				void *private_data,
 				const char *format, ...)
 {
 	[...]
 	lttng_backend_trace(kernel_pretty_print_sched_switch,
 		            "prev_pid %d next_pid %d prev_state %ld",
               		    prev->pid, next->pid, prev->state);
 }
