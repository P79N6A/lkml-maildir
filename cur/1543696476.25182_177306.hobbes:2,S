Me too.
If the dentry was on the dentry_unused list then it would get a whacky
refcount and we would simply leak it.
It is only in the very rare case that the dentry gets freed up between the
two dput()s that the slab debugging will trip.
So probably, we've been leaking dentries as a result of rename activity by
NFS clients, but nobody noticed.
