My -secure tree is also rock solid on SMP :p

I agree on this. Therefore my 2.2-secure tree has a 2.4 IDE backport from the 
PLD Project by Krzysiek Taraszka & Krzysiek Oledzki. It's not that up2date 
like .21 and .22 IDE code is, but it works very very smooth and nice and rock 
solid. We use the 2.2-secure tree for almost all customers in my company. 
Biggest harddisk is a 160GB Maxtor IDE disk.

ack! Current 2.2 is missing, for example, hashing exploits in network stack, 
like 2.4 had some time ago.

This might be the hardest job. This is not done in 2.2-secure. I think the 
effort in doing this is not worth the time it takes.

I agree 100%. Anyway, no comment from Alan, so I think he don't want to give 
2.2 away to me.
P.S.: I've cc'ed Ruben, Alan and Ville.
ciao, Marc
