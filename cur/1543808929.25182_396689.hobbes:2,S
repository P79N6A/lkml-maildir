I don't think it needs to be a class, but I think that there should be a 
single place with a directory for each device that could be what you want, 
with a file that tells you if it is. That's why I was looking at block/; 
these things must be block devices, and there aren't an huge number of 
block devices.
I suppose "grep 1 /sys/block/*/device/dvdwriter" is just as good; I hadn't 
dug far enough in to realize that the reason I wasn't seeing anything 
informative in /sys/block/*/device/ was that I didn't have any devices 
with informative drivers, not that it was actually supposed to only have 
links to other things.
