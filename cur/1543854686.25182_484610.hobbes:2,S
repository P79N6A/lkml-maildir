Thank you -very- -much- for finding the basis behind my paranoia!
I guess my intuition is still in good working order.  ;-)
It might be unlikely, but that makes it even worse -- a strange memory
corruption problem that happens only under heavy load, and even then only
sometimes.  No thank you!!!
I suspect that this affects Jens as well, though I don't claim to
completely understand his usage.
One approach to get around this would be for the the "idx" returned from
srcu_read_lock() to keep track of the CPU as well as the index within
the CPU.  This would require atomic_inc()/atomic_dec() on the fast path,
but would not add much to the overhead on x86 because the smp_mb() imposes
an atomic operation anyway.  There would be little cache thrashing in the
case where there is no preemption -- but if the readers almost always sleep,
and where it is common for the srcu_read_unlock() to run on a different CPU
than the srcu_read_lock(), then the additional cache thrashing could add
significant overhead.
Thoughts?
							Thanx, Paul
