I suppose IRQs need to overlap like this, but cpusets often can't
overlap like this.
If a system has the cgroup hierarchy you draw:
  /cgroup
  /cgroup/system
  /cgroup/system/boot
  /cgroup/big_honking_app
  /cgroup/rt_domain
this must not force the cpuset hierarchy to be:
  /dev/cpuset
  /dev/cpuset/system
  /dev/cpuset/system/boot
  /dev/cpuset/big_honking_app
  /dev/cpuset/rt_domain
I guess this means IRQs cannot be added to the cpuset subsystem
of cgroups.  Rather they have to be added to some other cgroup
subsystem, perhaps a new one just for IRQs.
In perhaps the most common sort of cpuset hierarchy:
  /dev/cpuset
  /dev/cpuset/boot
  /dev/cpuset/batch_sched
  /dev/cpuset/big_honking_app
  /dev/cpuset/rt_domain
none of boot or its siblings overlap.
