Do you still have the vmlinux? It'd be interesting to see what
$ gbd vmlinux
(gdb) l *cfq_dispatch_insert+0x28
says, here that'd be cfqq dereference. And that must be valid, it's set
on allocation time and only cleared after free. So unless lvm issues
private requests that aren't properly allocated, this whole thing looks
very bizarre.
