This sounds like one of the Red Hat kernels - those are immensely
patched and very different from the original Linux kernels normally
discussed here.
However ...

There definitely is a memory leak in the Red Hat 9 kernels, including
the 2.4.20-20.9smp kernel (seems to be in the uniprocessor build as well).
It leaks mm_struct slabs - see the trend graphs I do from the slabinfo
data, available at 
http://tyge.sslug.dk/bb-cgi/larrd-grapher.cgi?host=tyge.sslug.dk&service=slabinfo
The blue curve is the mm_struct slab allocation (column 5, the "active
pages" column from /proc/slabinfo) - the way it continually grows from
the system is rebooted IMHO points to a memory leak somewhere. This is
very clear from the third graph, which goes back the last 48 days,
during which we had two reboots of the system (hardware related).
The standard kernels from www.kernel.org do not have this problem,
so I am fairly certain it is in one of the Red Hat patches.
Others also see it:
