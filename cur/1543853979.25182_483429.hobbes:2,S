Hello,
I tried to switch an NFSROOT-Environment from NFS version 2 to NFS
version 3, but unfortunately my test client machine now hangs every time
after booting as soon as some bigger file system activity should occur.
I tried Kernel 2.6.14.7 and Kernel 2.6.16.32.
The problem did not occur with NFS version 2.
Does anybody know the problem and/or a solution?
Regards
  Christoph Pleger
