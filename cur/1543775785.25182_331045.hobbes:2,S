__symbol_get should eventually call try_module_get, which increments the
use count, right?
But I'm completely misusing symbol_get - as you say, that is supposed
to be "symbol_name", not a pointer to the symbol.
Any suggestions on a good way to do what I wanted to do?  Frankly a
new LSM hook seems the cleanest solution.  Or, I could ramp up the
locking and permit module deletion, probably at a bit of performance
cost.  Or I could just count on modules doing a symbol_get on
themselves?
thanks,
