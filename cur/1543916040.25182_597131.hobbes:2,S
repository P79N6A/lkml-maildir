Hi!
Is it possible/feasible to use git as a filesystem?
Like having git on top of ext3.
This way I could do a gitfs-gc and there is only one
pack file sitting on the disk which is a compressed
version of the whole system.
I am not interested in a version controlled filesystem,
only in the space saving aspects.
Thanks,
Peter
