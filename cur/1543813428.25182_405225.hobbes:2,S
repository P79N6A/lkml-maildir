Hmm, OK.

It's not configured into the kernels of either of the distros I use (Red
Hat or SUSE).  I can't have a required part of my driver depend on a
feature that's not enabled in the major distro kernels.
I'd like a mechanism that is (a) always there (b) easy for kernel to use
and (c) easy for userspace to use.  A sysfs file satisfies a, b, and c,
but I can't use it; a sysfs bin file satisfies all three (a bit worse on
b), but I can't use it; debugfs isn't there, so I can't use it.
That leaves me with few options, I think.  What do you suggest?  (Please
don't say netlink.)
