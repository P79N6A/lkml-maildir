If the impact is very slight or unmeasurable this means the option
needs to fall under CONFIG_EMBEDDED, where you can change if
every last bit of RAM counts but otherwise you won't care.

Some drivers appear to puke simply because the value is 64bit.  Which
means the driver will have problems on any 64bit kernel.  That kind
of behavior is worth purging.
