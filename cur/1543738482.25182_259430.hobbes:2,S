The chances of successfully finding 256 physically contiguous free
pages are small.  A shrink_all_memory() pass will help of course,
but the chances of failure are still quite high.
Dunno - maybe alloc_pagedir() should use vmalloc()?  That's a non-atomic
allocation but alloc_pagedir() really shouldn't be using GFP_ATOMIC anyway.
