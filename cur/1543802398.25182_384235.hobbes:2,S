A newer version, trying to cater to the various comments in here.
Changes:
- Add 1G_OPT split, meant for 1GiB machines. Uses 0xB0000000
- Add 1G/3G split
- Move the 2G/2G a little, so the full 2GiB of ram can be mapped.
- Improve help text (I hope :)
- Make option depend on EXPERIMENTAL.
- Make the page.h a lot more readable.
---
Add option for configuring the page offset, to better optimize the
kernel for higher memory machines. Enables users to get rid of high
memory for eg a 1GiB machine.
