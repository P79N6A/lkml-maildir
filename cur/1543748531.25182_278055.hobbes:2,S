Yes, that is correct.

Yeah, I forgot I left it in the patch, that was part of my initial test
code.  I'll clean it up and mark it as such.

Heh, ok, will do.

Good point, I'll fix that, thanks.

Hm, I don't remember why I did that.  I'll move that in the macro just
to save 2 lines of code :)

Well config.h should be first.  After that, sometimes it matters, but
usually not.

Just being "correct" :)
I don't think they would want special nodes, but hey, let's not prevent
anyone from doing anything.  If some looney person wants to make device
nodes in debugfs, then they deserve the ridicule they will get when
doing it...
Thanks for reviewing the code, I appreciate it.
