But the drivers already know, or would have to be taught to know
about it. Somewhence that information has to come. You cannot
avoid that effort.

That is wrong. You'd need a common method to determine device type
and several methods of passing guid. You are better off in implementing
one common way of getting at that information, which shouldn't be
too hard, as all the generic layer would have to do is pass up that information.

So implement a scsi low level method called 'get_guid' and pass its
result with the other hotplugging information. Simple, no callbacks needed
and no problems with simultaneous plugging events.
The only problem you now face is stale symlinks. Which is not trivial.
If you have a link /dev/volumes/scratchvol -> /dev/sdc and you issue
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/volumes/scratchvolume you want to be very sure
that the symlink is current.
IMHO you need a kernel part that kills the symlink upon device removal.
