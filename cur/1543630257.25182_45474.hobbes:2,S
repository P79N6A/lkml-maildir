His test was different.
He opened a file in a legal situation (shell can create a new file), and
then forked off a suid process over and over with the stdout of that
process set to a dup of the shell's already open fd.
It's perfectly legal for the shell to sit around with a file open and
pass it off to a child, even if the disk is full.
It's also perfectly legal for root to write to the fd, even if the disk
is full (for normal users).  
It just happens that the suid program wasn't the one who chose what file
it was going to write stdout to - the shell did.
Thus, the security violation.
mount > /etc/passwd doesn't work, because the shell can't open
/etc/passwd for writing.
