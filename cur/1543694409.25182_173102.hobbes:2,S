A short explanation :
"Basic packet of kernel time, around 10ms on x86. Related to HZ, the basic
resolution of the operating system. The timer interrupt is raised each
10ms, which then performs some h/w timer related stuff, and marks a couple
of bh's ready to run if applicable."
is given at :
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/glossary/#J
For more details you could take a look at these files (there are more) in
the kernel source :
include/linux/delay.h
init/main.c
to find more relevant files try something like this in the kernel source
tree :
for i in `find -name *.[ch]`; do grep -H jiffy $i; done
Kind regards,
