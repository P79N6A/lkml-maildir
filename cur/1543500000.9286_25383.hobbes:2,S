Or NT will eventually die. Much more desirable outcome, IMO. It's
definitely inferior design. Remember, every self-appointed UNIX-killer
ate flaming death and UNIX is alive and well. Where is VMS? Where is
OS/2? Where is (spit) MacOS? Exactly. They boast. They suck. They die.
It is that simple. NT will follow them, just give it some time. New
"UNIX-killer" will appear, only to follow the previous ones. Who cares?
