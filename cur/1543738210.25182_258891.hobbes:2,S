OK, thanks Andrew. Can I ask that we revisit these after 2.6.9 comes
out? I don't think the situation should be worse than 2.6.8, and
basically 2.6.9 is in bugfix only mode at this point, so I doubt we
could get anything more in even if we wanted to.
Please be sure to bring this up again after 2.6.9. Thanks.
Nick
