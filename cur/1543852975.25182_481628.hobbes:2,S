this isnt about in-flight IO (suspend doesnt succeed if IO is in flight 
anyway). The bug is this:
  1) you use the floppy and then stop using it
  2) 1 hour passes. Nothing uses the floppy.
  3) you suspend and later resume
  4) another hour passes. Nothing uses the floppy.
  5) you try to use the floppy: you get a bunch of IO errors!
  6) you try to use the floppy again: this time it works
that's the regression. For some reason suspend/resume puts the floppy 
hardware into a state that confuses the floppy driver.
my patch adds all the right suspend/resume hooks for this, without 
reintroducing the bug that was noticed by lockdep and which was fixed by 
my patch that introduced this regression - we just have to figure out 
what to do upon resume to get the floppy driver and the hardware match 
up each other, without passing spurious IO errors to the user.
