mlock does not guarantee anything of that form. A syscall by an mlocked
process which causes a memory allocation can cause paging of another
process on the system.

It depends a lot on hardware but you can certainly get user space delays
in seconds as an extreme worst case.

Yes - the fact we may well have bounced off the floor already.

Thats fine - nothing says a user space daemon isn't a good starting point.

No doesn't work like that. The command currently being processed on IDE
can take up to 60 seconds to complete. Idle immediate (on the devices it
works for - it hangs some) is very special in that it can be used in some
cases to interrupt a running command sequence. It requires a significant
amount of work in the driver layer to then clean up and requeue the
partial command and to know if it is possible to do so.

I think we have three things here
1.	A general queue freeze scheme from user space
2.	A general implementation of a queue freeze that stops further
command issuing while the queue is blocked
3.	The ability for devices to provide a function to be called
when a queue freeze is done (ie idle immediate and the like)
The fine details of how you abort an ATA command don't actually matter
for an initial implementation and can be written once the core stuff is
right.

The scsi midlayer is the main manager of queues so that seems sane - and
if you've got the basic queue freeze logic right then one assumes it will
work for scsi too.
