This fix gets the NMI to tick like the timer (in /proc/interrupts) ..
However, now that it's ticking I don't think it's actually working
properly ..
I used this simple test case given by you a long time ago,
main ()
{
iopl(3);
for (;;) 
        asm("cli");
}
This doesn't look like a regression tho, 2.6.19-rc6 has the same
behavior ..
