No, this completely depends on the Task the OS has to do and the Hardware
the OS has to run on. Cooperative Systems can have a lot more throughput
than time sliced systems.

The problem is, that Linux is not a Microkernel Based System. So if you want
a microkernel based system ust used one. There are lot out there. Based on
MACH or whatever. You can consier to work with the HURD. I mean it is not a
bad idea to rethink design of the Linux Kernel, but changing it into a
Microkernel means rewriting it. And I am not sure it will helo the Linux
development a lot (remeber ist WAS the fastest among all others, this can be
due to the fact that the monolitic kernel is supperior in development
effords).
