Hi Rusty !
Very good move, that I have thought about too... I believe that since
we're creating a Virtualization Menu, we should add
OS-level-virtualization there as well  (aka containerization) - the
following things: IPC virtualization (aka IPC namespaces), PID
virtualization, UTS virtualization. Those are 3 basic components that
went mainline into 2.6.19.

P.S. maybe rename those components from "IPC namespaces" to "IPC
virtualization" or even to "IPC containerization" it better reflect
it's internals?
