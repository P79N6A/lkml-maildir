It is currently unused.  However, the reason is that we removed the scsi
command method that allows polled operation in a driver (this routine is
actually polling the interrupt port on the chip).
I'd like to wait a while to see if anyone still needs this mode when 2.6
gets a wider test audience.  If you wish, you can surround the routine
with #if 0 and a comment saying we can junk it later if it really is
unnecessary.
Thanks,
James
