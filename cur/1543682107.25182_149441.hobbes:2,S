Well, support for each of the subtypes can be conditional or even
in their own submodules that share a common "library" module.

Well, the current build process is horrible :)

Why can't you declare the others unsupported even if they are in
the same module? You'd have three config option for including support
for each specific chip type and two of them would be marked unsupported.

This is not acceptable for a driver in mainline, just FYI.
