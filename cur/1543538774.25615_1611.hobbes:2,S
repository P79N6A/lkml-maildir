Linux 2.4.0test3 on an Athlon, with Ben Grear's vlan patch applied,
and the eepro100 init string tweaked to make the card accept big frames.
I get the occasional message
eth0: card reports no resources
Sometimes I get this message repeatedly on boot and cannot initialize the
interface. Other times it boots fine, but gives me this message later on
(though in this case there's no obvious network failure - ping still
works afterwards).
This did not happen with earlier 2.3.xx kernels. I'm not sure if it was present in 2.4.0test[12].
