Think about it --- the amount of work a server can do is bounded by the
cost of doing each unit of work.  That cost is O(1) for the event model
and O(n) for poll.
The event model only ever uses poll if the event queue overflows, which
is expected to be a rare occurrence (it *never* happens during heavy
local-load benchmarking with phhttpd).
