I'm getting a strange error message with knfsd and 2.2.1 vanilla.
When i do a rc.nfsd start i get the following output:
./rc.nfsd start
Starting NFS services: rpc.kstatd rpc.kmountd rpc.knfsd nfssvc: Function
not implemented
now heres the funny thing,if i do a status it tells me that knfsd is running
./rc.nfsd status
rpc.kmountd (pid 3872) is running...
rpc.knfsd (pid 3891) is running...
lockd (pid 3897) is running...
but a ps auxfwww|grep 3891 results with nothing and i cant find any nfsd
entries in the process list. 
I have compiled nfs in my kernel. the network file system portion of my
.config
#
# Network File Systems
#
CONFIG_CODA_FS=m
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_NFSD_SUN is not set
CONFIG_SUNRPC=y
CONFIG_LOCKD=y
CONFIG_SMB_FS=m
# CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 is not set
# CONFIG_NCP_FS is not set
I dont have CONFIG_NFSD_SUN set because i am under the impression that this
option is for exporting nfs mounts that are nfs mounts of the nfsd server.
I do not know what this error means. Do i need any special patches? Thanks
in advance
