What sort of hardware would you need for the three boxes to run these 
tests?
I understand that Karim doesn't have time to keep running these tests, but 
I'm wondering if others would be able to scrape up surplus hardware and 
setup the test config, accepting configs/kernels from a couple people to 
test.
I know that I have a large number of slow (<200MHz) pentiums that are just 
sitting around at home and could be used for this, but I don't know if 
they would be considered fast enough for any portions of this test (I have 
a much smaller number of faster machines that could possibly be used)
even if none of the big-name testing facilities want to do this we should 
be able to get something setup.
