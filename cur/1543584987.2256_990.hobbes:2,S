I just saw one of these 32 processor machines at Internet World,
and the engineer said that AIX and the successor to SCO Unix would
also run on the machine.  Perhaps the engineers doing the AIX port
are under less restrictive terms.
(When the two people he was talking to asked about Linux on the machine, 
he said "We feel Linux can't do enterprise-level stuff like this."
He got a little defensive when we questioned his judgement.)
