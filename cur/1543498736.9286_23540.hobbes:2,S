Gordon,
Ha Ha.  Very Funny.  David Geobel (The author of FASTFAT and portions of
NTFS for Microsoft) is actually a contractor for TRG.  David wrote large
portions of the FENRIS for NT code for us.  I will ask him about this.   He
has told me there were several other issues with FASTFAT and FAT32 and with
going back and forth between DOS, Win98,  and NT, in particular, there are
some issues with how NT mangles DOS short names vs. how Windows 98 does
it -- Linux doesn't comply with either method.   Compatibility between
FASTFAT and DOS does not seem to be a particularly a pressing issue for MS
based on what I've seen and know about, so your comment doesn't necessarily
reflect one way or the other if this could affect anyone.  To be 100%
compliant with all uses of a FAT partition, it's probably better not to use
these names.
Very Truly Yours,
Jeff
