Well anyway. If it was important, you could save a few instruction
cycles as:
static __inline__ void bump()
{
    __asm__ __volatile__( "incl jiffies\n");
}
Which translates to:
#APP
	incl jiffies
#NO_APP
There could be different macros for different CPU types. If it isn't
important, then the *((unsigned long *) &jiffies)++ code is not
important either and should be simply jiffies++ as the original
caller stated.
