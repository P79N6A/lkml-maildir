I didn't reboot my pc yet, so I'm still running a 2.4.20 without any problem 
with my mouse. but when I will boot on the 2.5.70, what I should do to find 
where does the bug come from. I'm little but new here, so I never try to 
locate a bug in a kernel...
thanks for your advice

Jugglers, like programmers, handle objects which, at first sight, seem complex

control one or the other or both at the same time, and thus become aware of 
what they are doing.
