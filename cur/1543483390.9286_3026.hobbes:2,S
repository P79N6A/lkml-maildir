agreed (duh), so I ran some more tests:
Case 1. 
-2.0.36 running netscape --[10Mps ether. eth0 MTU=1500]->
-2.2.1(MASQ router eth0 MTU=1500, ppp0 MTU=576)> --(ppp modemlink)-> 
-2.0.35(dial in ppp0 MTU=1500)
		     ^^^^^^^^
Result: works fine
Case 2. 
-2.0.36 running netscape --[10Mps ether. eth0 MTU=1500]->
-2.2.1(MASQ router eth0 MTU=1500, ppp0 MTU=576)> --(ppp modemlink)-> 
-2.0.35(dial in ppp0 MTU=576)
		     ^^^^^^^	
Results: -Netscape on 2.0.36 host DOES NOT WORK with this site
	 -Netscape on 2.2.1 router works
