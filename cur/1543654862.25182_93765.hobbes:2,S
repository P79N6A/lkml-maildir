Subject: 2.4.20 - hangs when rebooting...

Hello all,
	I've encountered a new problem since upgrading from 2.4.19 to 
2.4.20.  Basically, when I go to reboot my machine, it hangs imeddiate 
after it says "Restarting system".  Then nothing.  I have to hit the reset 
button.  Thankfully, though, everything has already been unmounted.  I 
never had this problem with 2.4.19, nor do I have it now if I reboot into 
2.4.19.  After it says "Restarting system", the screen blanks and the 
computer reboots :-)
	My kernel configuration between the two is the exact same.  The
only reason why I upgraded was for better support of my ICH4 IDE
controller on a fairly new motherboard.  This is an Intel i845 with a 2
Gig P4 processor, 512 Megs RAM.  Happens with both apm disabled and 
enabled.  
	Any ideas? :-) Thanks.
Adam
