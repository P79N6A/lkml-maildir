The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test11 is available.
UML is now able to run as a daemon, i.e. with no stdin/stdout/stderr.
The hostfs filesystem now works as a readonly filesystem.  It's now 
configurable.  I'm using it as a module.  It ought to work compiled into the 
kernel, but I haven't checked this.
I fixed a number of bugs.
NOTE:  If you compile from source, you must put 'ARCH=um' on the make command 
line or in the environment, like:
	make linux ARCH=um
or
	ARCH=um make linux
or
	export ARCH=um
	make linux
This is because I've changed the top-level Makefile to build either a native 
kernel or a usermode kernel, with the default being native.  This is in 
preparation for submitting this port to the main pool.  The ARCH calculation 
is now this:
# SUBARCH tells the usermode build what the underlying arch is.  That is set
# first, and if a usermode build is happening, the "ARCH=um" on the command
# line overrides the setting of ARCH below.  If a native build is happening,
# then ARCH is assigned, getting whatever value it gets normally, and 
# SUBARCH is subsequently ignored.
SUBARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed -e s/i.86/i386/ -e s/sun4u/sparc64/ -e 
s/arm.*/arm/ -e s/sa110/arm/)
ARCH := $(SUBARCH)
If anyone has any objections to this going in the main pool, let me know, and 
also let me know what you would suggest as a fix.
