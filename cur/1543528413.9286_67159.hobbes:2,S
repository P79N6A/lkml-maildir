Hi,
Recently i bought an ACCTON lan card  ( EN1207D-TX/SMC1211TX)
The driver provided with it is compiled for kernel version 2.0.36
but i have the kernel version 2.2.12.
I even tried it with insmod -f  option but again gave many errors.
I would be very grateful if somebody could help me in this.
Thanks in advance.
