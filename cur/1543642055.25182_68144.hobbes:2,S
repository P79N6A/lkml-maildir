Those pages are useless!  It's silly having slab hanging onto them
while we go and reclaim useful pagecache instead.
I *really* think we need to throw away those pages instantly.
The only possible reason for hanging onto them is because they're
cache-warm.  And we need a global-scope cpu-local hot pages queue
anyway.
And once we have that, slab _must_ release its warm pages into it.
It's counterproductive for slab to hang onto warm pages when, say,
a pagefault needs one.

As I say, by not releasing those (useless to slab) pages, we're causing
other (useful) stuff to be reclaimed.
