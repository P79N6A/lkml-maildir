i agree fully. The attached patch against test8-pre1 changes
schedule_idle() from inline to FASTCALL - things look much nicer with this
one applied.
the patch's second half adds the check for need_resched after schedule().
IMO this is needed not only for (admittedly secondary reason of) latency,
but for correctness as well: schedule_idle() might have preempted the
current process (even if both processes are non-idle), so checking for
need_resched is needed for robustness.
