Only idea I have is to unmount the drive ( or remount r/o ) and 
repeatedly md5sum the block device and see if it ever fails to correctly 
read the data, and if you get any errors in your syslog.  If you get no 
error messages in your syslog and md5sum completes without error but 
does not get the same hash each time, then there is definitely something 
very fubar with the hardware or deep in the kernel.
