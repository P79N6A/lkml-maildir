Hi.
Thanks for the pointer.
I was aware of swap extents, but didn't look at the supporting
infrastructure because I originally wrote the code for 2.4, before I
looked at porting it to 2.6.
Having said that, I've looked at them now, but think that they probably
wouldn't help me.
This is partly because I've ended up using extents to store all the
meta-data: swap addresses, which blocks on the swap devices are used,
and which pages are used for what. (Sorry, only mentioning blocks in the
previous message did mislead you).
More importantly that that, though, I'm using whole pages for storing
the extents, and store the pages in the header of the image (after
making them relocatable). They replace the 'pagedirs' in Patrick's and
Pavel's implementations.
Regards,
Nigel
