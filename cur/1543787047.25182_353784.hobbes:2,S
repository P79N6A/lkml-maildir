Hi,

"logically organized" mainly means reducing dependencies by organizing 
them by their logical dependencies. If a large header file is included by 
a lot of other files, some parts maybe separated to reduce header 
dependencies. The same can be done for config dependencies, so that a 
config change doesn't necessarily recompiles the whole kernel.
Your change doesn't reduce any dependecies and it's not such a big 
cleanup:

The noise generated by the separation is larger than the avoided 
duplication.
The hardcoded defines actually do need fixing, frv is especially bad, as 
it even has hardcoded structure offsets.

sched.h is especially challenging due to dependencies between headers 
under asm and linux. It's not just splitting sched.h, it also requires 
analyzing its dependencies.
