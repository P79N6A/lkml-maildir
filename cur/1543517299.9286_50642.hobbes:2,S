My problem is that the errors I get is very nearly continous - every
time the disk has to do some i/o I get these errors. Sometimes there is
only 2 but other times there may be 8 or 12 error messages.  This is a
brand new drive with new kernel. My older kernel did the same and I
assumed it was due to being dated - but the later kernel does exactly
the same.  My concern is that something may have been changed in the new
drives and and the kernel guys are unaware ( is it possible?) of it. I
am new at posting errors in the kernel and I assume that these hard
working developers *do* take notice of this discussion.
I need to solve this pretty soon as the system has to be shipped to the
customer and barfing messages like this is not a good way to create
confidence in the system.
Thanks for your input.
