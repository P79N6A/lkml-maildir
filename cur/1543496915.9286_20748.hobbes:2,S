> open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
lists dso's to link before any other dynamic linking occurs; useful for
overriding, say, malloc().
> open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
Contains a cache of where dso's are located on the disk, so the dynamic
linker doesn't have to search for them.
