Thanks andi for the response but I have some comment to tell.
1- The TBF does not drop packets asI have made the "limit" value to big
(1MB).. Also I have checked that using the -s option in TC where I found no
packets are dropped. Finally I can see the packets released after a while
(using tcpdump) so that means that no drooping is happennig.
2- The application can not be fixed as it is commercial MS product.
3- Setteing the burst size to one full big datagram will make the traffic
nonconforment to the EF statndard and it will be dropped in the next
policing piont.
Thanks
Wael
