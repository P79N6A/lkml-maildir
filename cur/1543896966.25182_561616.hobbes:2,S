Of course, there currently is no "inside" a menuconfig.  You would have to do
something like make everything inside an "if FOO / endif" gain not just a
dependency on FOO, but also gain a dependency on all of FOO's dependencies.

Like that I suggested here?

Basically, make menuconfig work like menu does, except the menu itself can be
turned on and off.  Instead of having menuconfig work like a config, but with
some kind of "menu" hint.  It seems like the former is more in line with what
menuconfig is actually used for.
