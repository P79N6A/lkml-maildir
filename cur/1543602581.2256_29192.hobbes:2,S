It appears that while glibc is LGPL, it in turn #include's stuff from 
the kernel.  It more or less has to; otherwise glibc has to guess the 
format of data structures the kernel is going to export.
Greg is partially correct that this is a licensing issue that the glibc 
maintainers need to resolve. However, I am not convinced that they can 
resolve it on their own. I see only the following possible resolutions:
    * we all decide (an opinion) that #include some_gpl.h does not GPL
      the code doing the including
    * glibc changes its license to GPL, which would make it unpopular
      among proprietary application developers
    * Linux maintainers decide to change the license on the relevant
      header files to LGPL
If one of the above does not happen, then I think I can derive "false" :-)
