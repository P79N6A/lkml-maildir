I could understand what the original code did at last.
If a kprobe is inserted on a breakpoint which other debugger inserts,
it single step inline instead of out-of-line.(this is done in prepare_singlestep)
In this case, (p && kprobe_running() && kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS)
is true and we need pass the control to the debugger.
And if (*p->ainsn.insn != BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION) (or (p != kprobe_running())) in
that case, there may be some bugs.
Now I think your original suggestion is correct.
Please fix it in another patch.
Thank you very much,
