it seems you've got hpet active by default:
 /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource:
 hpet
 /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource:
 hpet acpi_pm pit jiffies tsc
do you get a similar lockup if you use acpi_pm? You can do that either 
by disabling the HPET options in your .config, or by doing this prior 
starting up X:
  echo acpi_pm > /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
