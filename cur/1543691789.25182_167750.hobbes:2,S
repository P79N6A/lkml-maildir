Why should I have anything to explain? :-)
The fact that ia64 is doing a printk for an unaligned kernel
load or store is what you should be asking questions about :)
It's one thing if ia64 keeps track of unaligned accesses as
a counter statistic, but emitting a printk for everyone is
pretty anti-social.
Unaligned accesses in the kernel are perfectly normal, and are
absolutely going to happen in various kinds of networking setups.
