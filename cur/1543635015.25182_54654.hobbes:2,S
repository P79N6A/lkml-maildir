Conventional wisdom varies depending on whose conventions you are asking :-)

Yes, well I know it is controversial ...

The CodingStyle file is silent on this.
I just find it a real pain sometimes trying to figure out what other
include files I need to when all I really want is one or two definitions
in one particular include file.  The same holds true when I am removing
or moving stuff from one place to another (especially when trying to
clean up some of the current mess).
Given that all kernel header files protect themselves from being included
multiple times, I think locality wins us something.
As I said, this is (just) my (humble) opinion.  :-)
