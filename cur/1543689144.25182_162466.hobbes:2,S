What's proven very helpful to figure out these things is to run a
test script against md, and just trying all the various possible actions
via mdadm or raidtools randomly.
I've done that for m-p, and while it's not pretty, it is _really_
helpful and has found all sorts of weird accounting bugs in the md code
(2.4 has many):

 - if
anyone feels like extending it to include raid5/raid1 etc, that would be
cool ;-)
