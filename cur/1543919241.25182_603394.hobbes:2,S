True (speaking for me; I forget whether Linus ever got to see it).
I apologize to you, Nick, for getting you into this position of
fighting for something which wasn't your choice in the first place.
If I thought we'd have a better kernel by dropping this patch and
going back to one that just avoids the refcounting, I'd say do it.
No, I still think it's worth trying this one first.
But best have your avoid-the-refcounting patch ready and reviewed
for emergency use if regression does show up somewhere.
Thanks,
Hugh
