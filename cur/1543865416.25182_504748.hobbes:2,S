The current patch takes them off when mlock is set (which may not work 
since the page may be off the LRU) and then has the scanner taking them 
off. We could just remove the early one but what would this bring us?

Hmmm... You mean without checking all the vmas of a page for VM_LOCKED? So they 
are going to be removed again on the next pass? Ok. I see that makes it 
simpler but it requires another reclaim scan.

The page flag allows a clean state transition of a page and accurate 
keeping of statistics for MLOCKed pages. There were objections against the 
fuzzy counting in the earlier incarnation and it was proposed that a page 
flag be introduced. Without the flag we cannot know that the page is 
already mapped by a VM_LOCKED vma without scanning over all vmas 
referencing the page.

I thought someone else could come up with something. Maybe the one that 
told me to use another page flag?

We need to expand page migration anyways to allow the gerneral migration 
of non-LRU pages.
