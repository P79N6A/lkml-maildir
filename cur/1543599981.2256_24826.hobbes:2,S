You think it's the elevator?  It could be, but scanning policy seems much
more likely.

Actually, the situation improves a little as you add memory.  I'll show that
mathematically tomorrow.

This is the normal case, except for startup and a few special situations such 
as after heavy file deletion or unmounting a volume.

We must be getting a little bit of avoidable fragmentation on freeing, but 
the real culprit is allocation, which tends to split up higher order 
allocations rapidly.

Yes, well, if we make it work properly that might not be necessary ;-)
I imagine a lot of higher order allocations could be removed without hurting 
performance, for example, where dma can handle non-physically-contiguous 
regions (i.e., scatter/gather).  On the other hand, leaving them just the way 
they are creates more incentive to fix the damn thing, not to mention 
providing the needed test cases.
