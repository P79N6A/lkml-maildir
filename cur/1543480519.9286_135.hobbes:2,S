That was just me being lazy, sizeof(int) should equal sizeof(unsigned long) on
my architecture (Cyrix 686MX PR233).

My current line of thought is that maybe there is a memory leak somewhere -
probably in ntfs but perhaps not - that is causing the kernel to legitimately
run out of memory. Is there a limit to the amount of memory the kernel may
allocate, do you know? (I'm reading through the mm/slab.c stuff to try and
quickly educate myself :)
Cheers,
Steve
