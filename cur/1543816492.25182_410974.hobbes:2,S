    Nep.  It's acting as a server :-).  It's also SMP, does
that work with SWSUSP?  Guess it has to now that laptops
have dual CPU's.  In fact that that makes me wonder: how well
do the SMP laptops do power management under linux?  Back
when I had a dual boot laptop, I seem to remember linux getting
about 25-33% more uptime.
