Subject: 2.4.2-ac3 == 400% speed improvement with Java

Hello,
any 2.4.1-ac5 kernel and above until 2.4.2-ac3 had a bug (Ingo guessed
it might be the yield() bug) that made Java (and some other things
*really* slow). This is fixed now. When I profiled slow kernels the
mtrr_file_add was taking up all of the time - even though I had
disabled mtrr in my kernel (it wasn't in /proc).
(Alan Cox: I'm not sure if the yield() bug was the problem, or if that
patch was in the TUX patch (based on -ac3) or the -ac3 patch.)
Here was the old test: (With 2.4.2-ac3 things are even faster than
2.2.14 at 0:00.44elapsed!!)
(jdk1.3.0_01)
> time java
(done multiple times so everything is in cache)
On 2.2.14 (400MHz Celeron/192MB RAM) this takes about 0.66ms.
