The keyboard produces unknown scancodes and escape sequences at
(seemingly)random intervals. I receive this message when I am at the
console:
keyboard: unknown e1 escape sequence
keyboard: unknown e1 escape sequence
keyboard: unrecognized scancode (65) - ignored
This issue also manifests itself in Xfree86 as a q character.
Where should I start to begin to fix this?
