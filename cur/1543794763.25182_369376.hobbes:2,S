Ouch.  It applied cleanly against both -rc1 and -rc2.  Ok, um...
Is there any way to extract a current patch against 2.6.15-rc1-git1 from the 
git web page?  I can get the most _recent_ diff at: 
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
But that's just for one changeset.  Possibly I can iterate through the 
changesets to get all the diffs back to -git1 and apply them in sequence (if 
that works).  But the ability to right click and download one big rollup 
patch would be really really nice.

P.S.  I don't use git.  Poked at it a few times, but I made the mistake of 
reading largeish chunks of the git man page and the git glossary in an 
attempt to get up to speed, and got a headache.  Anything that can define 
"clean" in such a way that I'm _less_ sure of the definition afterwards:

Learning git went back on the to-do list somewhere between cleaning behind the 
refrigerator and sorting my book collection by author...
