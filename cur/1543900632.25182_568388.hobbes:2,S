That's an excellent idea. I am still thinking along the lines of
"idiot proof simplicity." It would be nice to have a configure script
that scanned your system board, sound card/chip various input ports,
etc, and went ahead and preselected those to build when you type
"make.
If you could combine this with the make "allmodconfig" command in a
user friendly interface, I think you'd really be on to something!
--as long as it's still configurable after the preselected choices are
made.
