Look at the boot code. It puts the machine into protected mode before it
jumps to the image at 1 megabyte. It had to do this because the real-mode
16-element segments can only reach to just under 1 megabyte.
So the fact that you are in protected mode probably has nothing to do with
the 'stop'. Instead, note that the boot code reprograms the interrupt
controller. If you try to execute the raw image at 1 megabyte, without
first reprogramming the controller and masking off the interrupts, all
bets are off.
