So I can have special values that are negative. I suppose it doesn't really
matter - they could be small positive numbers or something, but then if I want
to add one later, you get the possibility of overlap on a userspace that
supports one running with a kernel that doesn't.

No... but then 640KB of memory is enough for anyone, right? :-)

Maybe. Though I think request_key() should follow the form of similar
functions inside the kernel, such as request_firmware().

Other people argued the exact opposite first.

If it becomes a real syscall rather than being a subset of prctl(), then yes.

Yes. I had added an additional statement into there at one point.

True. I don't know much about LSM though.
