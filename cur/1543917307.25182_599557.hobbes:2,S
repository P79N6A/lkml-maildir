I doubt there any apps which are going to specifically check for EFBIG
and do soemthing different if they get EOVERFLOW instead.  If it was
something like EAGAIN or EPERM, I'd be more concerned, but EFBIG
vs. EOVERFLOW?  C'mon!

I've got to agree with Alan, the sysfs/udev breakages that we've done
are far more significant, and the fact that we continue to expose
internal data structures via sysfs is a gaping open pit is far more
likely to cause any kind of problems than changing an error return.
