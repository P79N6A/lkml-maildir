Your proprietary database programme doesn't need any privs: make the
raw device file owned by "database" and run the database under that
account. There's no reason the device file has to be owned by root.
And your use of the term "smuggling capabilities" is false, misleading
and emotive. The correct term is "preserve capabilities", as that is
the intent of the sysadmin. The term "going behind the systems back"
is also false, misleading and emotive. Rather, the system is duly
performing the tasks required of it by the sysadmin.
