Hello,
I just tried to compile your exec-shield patch applied to
linux-2.4.21-rc7 but it gives me an error.  I applied 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/exec-shield-2.4.21-rc1-B6
These are the last make lines:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.21-rc7/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing
-fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-march=i586   -nostdinc -iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=traps
-c -o traps.o traps.c
traps.c: In function `trap_init_f00f_bug':
traps.c:849: `idt' undeclared (first use in this function)
traps.c:849: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
traps.c:849: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [traps.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/linux-2.4.21-rc7/arch/i386/kernel'
make[1]: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.21-rc7'
make: *** [stamp-build] Error 2
I also sent this to Ingo but as I don't know if it is a problem with
the patch or with kernel or a combination of both I send it to you,
too.
Thanks,
	Peter
