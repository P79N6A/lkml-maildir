OK.  What did you have in mind for the help text.  I changed it
a small bit.
I also added "depends on LEDS_CLASS" since defconfig didn't have that
set, but the build failed with wanting symbols that it provides.
Updated patch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add I2C to config since the driver makes several i2c*() calls.
Add to help text that the Intel I2C ICH (i801) driver is also needed
for this kernel.
Add LEDS_CLASS to config since the driver makes les_classdev_*() calls:
ERROR: "led_classdev_register" [drivers/input/misc/apanel.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__led_classdev_unregister" [drivers/input/misc/apanel.ko] undefined!
