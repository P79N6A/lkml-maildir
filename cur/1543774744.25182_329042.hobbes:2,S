Borislav,
	Do you have any input or anything to say? You are probably the one who has
messed more with the ecdump or with the controller and might be able to help
us grow a clue here. Any answer should point us more to were we want.
Could ecdump give any output of the accelerometer?
Could this be really attached to the controller?
