I tried to reproduce the old bug but I failed, no matter how many
patches I backout. However this isn't the -stable that was advertised
initially if patches like this are merged, given that it's unclear if
the old deadlock will come back or not. If I got an answer within a week
and not with a delay of half year after I posted the fix for the
deadlock we would be in a better shape, since perhaps I could still
reproduce it somehow (I could reproduce it in a reasonable amount of
time half an year ago). It's possible that scheduling and userland
changes may have hidden the deadlock (the deadlock requires buggy
userland and a sigsegv in gdb to reproduce, so if gdb is doing any
better that could be hidding it). It's also possible that the bug was
fixed in some other way, so I will try again after going back to the sp3
codebase that shouldn't have changed *that* much.
