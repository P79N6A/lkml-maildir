Ok I think best would be to create ops->ioctl callback for not so common
ioctls (like the temp one) and let the driver to deal with them.

Yep I have this in mind. But not yet the topic of the day. So far I have:
name - this is not need perhaps it can be found in another place in sysfs
timeout - timeout value in sec - convert it to ms perhaps?
ping - "ping" file, to replace the /dev/watchdog writes
boot_status - the boot status - meaning same as IOCTL has, generaly the reset reason
status - current status - same as ioctl equivalent
And optional firmware_ver to reflect the IOCTL equvalent.
This is needed to be discussed with Wim first. I hope he will speak up ;)
As for the temps/fans I belive the driver should register in hwmon class and use
hwmon class sysfs iterface and then just create sort of relation between the
sysfs files/classes, so the watchdog app can find the temps.

Good idea, I will change it. Thanks.

Ah I knew about the suspend/resume and it seems there is also a shutdown one.

I was quite amazed when I saw same code copied 40x in one directory ;)
Thanks for the comments,
