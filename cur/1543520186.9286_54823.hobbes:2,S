Hi,
recently, we upgraded a Linux box from 2.2.12 to 2.2.13, afterwards, our
backup administrators complained and locked that box out since their
ADSM server that our Linux box was a client of has crashed. It's IBM's
"Adstar Distributed Storage Manager" 3.1.2.0 on a Solaris 2.5.1
box. Now, this is really strange, but the server crashed immediately
after the client (with the new kernel) queried its schedule from the
server, so the coincidence gives strong hints that it has to do with the
2.2.13 upgrade. Regretfully, the only hint is 
Any hints as to where to track this odd behaviour down? My headaches are
a) that the affected machine cannot be rebooted easily, since it runs
web pages, is a mail hub, has font servers, bin directories, vpnd server
and so on.
b) I cannot debug without prior talk to administrators. 
c) IBM don't support Linux ADSM clients. 
d) if it fails, 300 other clients will be without backup/restore
services until the next business day.
