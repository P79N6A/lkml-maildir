Sorry, no, doesn't look good to me.  I do agree that it's an easy
solution to this problem, but there's no point in having gone the RCU
route to avoid cacheline bouncing, if you now reintroduce it all here.
I believe, as I said, that you'll have to go further, applying RCU
to freeing the entries themselves.  I had toyed with the idea of never
freeing entries once allocated, which is a similarly simple solution;
rejected that as in general too wasteful; and concluded that RCU is a
reasonable compromise - it amounts to lazy freeing, I think.
I'm happy to be overruled by someone who understands these cacheline
bounce issues better than we do, but nobody else has spoken up yet.
