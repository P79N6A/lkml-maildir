include/linux/fs.h declares:
         extern struct block_device *bdget(dev_t).
(you of course need to bdput(struct block_device *) when finished with it)
Along the way you may also need include/linux/kdev_t.h defining:
static inline int kdev_t_to_nr(kdev_t dev)
{
         return MKDEV(major(dev), minor(dev));
}
static inline kdev_t to_kdev_t(int dev)
{
         return mk_kdev(MAJOR(dev),MINOR(dev));
}
Hope this helps.
Best regards,
Anton
