When I use Cakewalk Home-Studio to record Music from my MIDI piano,
I notice that the clock-resolution shown is several orders of
magnitude better than anything a PC can generate! I haven't got
a clue where this information comes from. It is in seconds, starting
at 1 (not zero, don't know why) and has resolution of microseconds
with no missing codes. This is on a M$ PC.
This generates a highly-accurate "time ruler". One can back-up
through this time and resolve samples that appear synchronous
but can be displaced in time with apparent resolution much
better than the 38,400 baud-rate of MIDI. I don't know how
they do it, but this is the MIDI "sample-clock". It has to
be virtual because there isn't any hardware on a PC that can
duplicate it.
It is likely that they use a software PLL with some periodic
updates from a timer-tick, but it sure looks impressive to
see "real-time" with such resolution on a PC.
I'm pretty sure that if Cakewalk decided to port Home Studio
to Linux, they would be able to do it with no technical hurdles.
Its just that, for Music, most use Apple and cheapskates like
me use PCs running M$.
