This makes no sense.
If P is a partition of S, that means that P is a set of subsets of
S such that the intersection of any two members of P is empty, and
the union of the members of P equals S.
If P is a partition of S, then adding S itself to P as another member
makes P no longer a partion, for then every element of S is in two
elements of P, not one.
