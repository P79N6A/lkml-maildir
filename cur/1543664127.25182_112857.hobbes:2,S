Well I can't make it happen either now.  It went pop first time I tried it
yesterday.
That being said, I can still trigger it by mmapping /dev/loop0 MAP_SHARED and
dirtying it all.  That triggers the problematic PF_MEMALLOC path much more easily.
	mem=256M
	losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/hda5
	usemem  -m 300 -f /dev/loop0
	<oops>
(gdb) p/x lo->lo_flags
$3 = 0x0
Userspace is passing in lo_encrypt_type == 0, so loop_init_xfer() never calls the transfer
init function.
