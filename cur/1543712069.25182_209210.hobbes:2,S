It's obvious once you see the problem, isn't it?
Duncan Sands found exactly the same problem and the same solution a few 
months ago, but it was never added in.
In this case, your patch could be improved by calling device_initialize()  
during the first loop and device_add() during the second.  However, that
region of code is kind of in flux right at the moment.  When things settle
down, I promise to remember your change and make sure it gets in.
