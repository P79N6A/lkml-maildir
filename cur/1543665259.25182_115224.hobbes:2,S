Actually, I think your first patch is correct. TARGET_CPUS seems like the 
wrong thing to be changing (for example, if we take a CPU offline later)
However, doesn't this:

do more or less the same as set_ioapic_affinity? And even if not, don't
you have to do "mask << 24" instead of "mask" ... or am I just confused?
