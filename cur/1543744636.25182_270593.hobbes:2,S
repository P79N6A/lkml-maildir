Ok, I wasn't comparing apples to apples. I forgot I had to remove the sb live
card from this machine a few days ago. So the hardware config wasn't exactly
the same. I have reinstalled the sb live card now and I am retesting on 0.7.25.
The sb live shares an irq with ide2(promise card)

With the sb live card back in use the system has hung once with the sound looping.
It hung after I started playing a video in a second instance of the mythfrontend
application. I had the nmi_watchdog on and netconsole logging to another machine
but there was nothing in the logs.
I have rebooted and I am trying to verify the dma_timer_expiry issue is still gone
with the sb live in use.

I had originally thought this might be the cause as well so I jacked
ide2 priority but it didn't help. However it does share the irq so maybe
that is a factor here.
