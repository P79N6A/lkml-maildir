I've just been perusing the code and noticed that there is a bug in 
calculating the latency standard deviation caused by the fact that the 
latency that is inserted into the samples array is not necessarily the 
same as that added to total_latency and could be quite a bit larger.  So 
either the means are too small or the standard deviations are too large.
BTW, there's a method for calculating variances and means that avoids 
the need to keep an array of samples.  Basically, in addition to the sum 
of the samples (sum_x, say) you keep a sum of the squares of the samples 
(sum_x_sq, say) and the number of samples (n, say).  Then:
mean = sum_x / n
variance = (sum_x_sq - (mean * mean) / n) / (n - 1)
standard deviation = sqrt(variance)
Without the need to keep the array of samples there's no need worry 
about an arbitrary upper limit on the number of samples.
