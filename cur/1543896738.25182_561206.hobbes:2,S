Sorry for the delay, I missed this email.  If we can actually move irq
migration into process context on x86.  I would be happy to.
Currently I am dubious if this can be done reliably.  But I think
the benefits of doing irq migration outside of the irq handler
are sufficient to give another go at making it work.
However this isn't just Intel's ioapics we have to worry about,
but Intel's were the worst so that is a reasonable starting point.
