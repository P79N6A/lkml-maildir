ah hah.
trap_init() does:
	void __iomem *p = ioremap(0x0FFFD9, 4);
which returns phys_to_virt(0x0FFFD9) = 0xc00fffd9
then trap_init() does:
	iounmap(p);
and iounmap() does
	if ((void __force *) addr <= high_memory) 
		return; 
which doesn't work, because 0xc00fffd9 is outside 0 ... high_memory.
A quick fix is to delete that iounmap() call from trap_init(), because we
"know" how ioremap() works.  Or, better, simply use phys_to_virt(0x0FFFD9)
in trap_init().
Although a better fix might be to make __iounmap() behave symmetrically:
	if ((long)addr >= phys_to_virt(0xA0000) &&
			(long)addr < phys_to_virt(0x100000))
		return;
but that's not quite right, because we're assuming that the range to be
unmapped is wholly within the PCI/ISA region.  Without a VMA there just
isn't enough info to determine that.
Does anyone have any preferences?
