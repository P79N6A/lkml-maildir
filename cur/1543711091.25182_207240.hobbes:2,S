SCSI generic support
"If you want to use SCSI CD-writers" - it is not clear whether an ATAPI
CD-writer run under SCSI emulation is being considered a SCSI CD-writer
or not.
Maybe a pointer to some page defining these terms would solve the
problem. It could define what the term "SCSI CD-writer" means - if it
means some virtual interface provideed by Linux kernel that is prepared
for the usage by the user, of it is a rectangular metallic box with a
pop-out beverage holder.
