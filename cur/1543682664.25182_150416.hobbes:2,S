the granularity wasn't the issue, I need this feature anyways out of
cvsps (cvsps is exactly the thing that generates the changesets out of
the coarse granularity of the tags). the checkout/rsync being more
expensive sounds a fair enough argument for implementing the feature in
cvsps where it will be zero write cost.
since we're talking about bkcvs, I also would have a feature wish for
the repository export in rsync.kernel.org: would it be possible to
export a sequence number increased once before a transfer, and increased
a second time after the tree is coherent again? When the sequence number
is even and it didn't change before and after the rsync, we'll know the
current status is coherent and we don't need to repeat the rsync (after
some delay). Or is there any other mechanism that guarantees to get a
coherent repository out of rsync?
thanks,
Andrea
