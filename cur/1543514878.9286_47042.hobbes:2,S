I didn't say to use brw_page --- I said to look at brw_page.  It sets up
a vector of buffer_heads for the IO, and --- crucially --- initialises
them with a callback, end_buffer_io_async.
_That_ is where you get async callback for temporary buffer_heads
submitted to the IO layer.  You can replace that callback function with
anything you want.  No, brw_page won't do an arbitrary callback for you,
but it's a perfect example from which to construct your own function
which does exactly the IO you want, with exactly the buffer-cache
coherency you want, and exactly the callback you want at the end of it.
