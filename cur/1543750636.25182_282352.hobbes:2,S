The other part of Thomas's change is this one:
+static struct mm_struct *oom_kill_process(task_t *p)
+{
+ 	struct mm_struct *mm;
+	struct task_struct *c;
+	struct list_head *tsk;
+
+	/* Try to kill a child first */
+	list_for_each(tsk, &p->children) {
+		c = list_entry(tsk, struct task_struct, sibling);
+		if (c->mm == p->mm)
+			continue;
+		mm = oom_kill_task(c);
+		if (mm)
+			return mm;
+	}
+	return oom_kill_task(p);
+}
Thomas's changes worked better than previous code so far, he can clearly
identify forkbombs or services spread across multiple processes.
Without these changes it was trivial to fool the oom killer and lead to
sshd and other services being killed, so his changes makes lots of sense
to me. It seems certainly better than the current code.
Actually the only question I made to him is why he doesn't kill the
"parent" instead of adding the above code, that is what is being
discussed here, but I was suggesting it as a good thing, not as a bad
thing. If we have a fork bomb killing the master parent would be
optimal. What he does above by killing the childs first is a lot more
conservative and I'm fine with it as well.
