Speaking of kswapd zone balancing.  Can swap cache pages be moved from
one zone to another, or even duplicated according to need later on?
It would seem logical that when a page in the DMA zone is only held for
swap cache, it's worth copying it to the regular zone and using the copy
when the page is needed again to free up DMA pages without hitting the
disk.
I guess this sort of preemptive duplication is in a similar category to
pre-zeroing.  
just a thought,
