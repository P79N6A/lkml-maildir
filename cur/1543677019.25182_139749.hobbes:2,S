Cool. The thing found something!
However, I'm still a bit confused:

Can source or target really be validly unhashed? That makes no sense,
since we just looked it up, and we've held the directory semaphores over
the whole thing.
In other words, I worry that the real bug is something else, and your 
patch makes it not oops, but hides the real problem.
I'm sure you're right, but can you tell me what the sequence of events is 
that validly leads to this?
