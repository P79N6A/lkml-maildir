Nope. It's not bug. It's [mis]feature.

Of course.

More correct place will be linux-fsdevel@vger.rutgers.edu I suppose but
anyway...

Hmm. Do you can READ ?

Even if here it does not matter (2.2.17 does not have support for this
facility) usually it's not wise to use such an ancient kernel.

Have you read vfat's ToDo ? Cyrillic letters with 2.2.x on VFAT partiton are
painfull.

As expected :-/ [Description of problem from VFAT's ToDo skipped]

TODO

* When only shortnames exist, translate them from the codepage character
  set to the iocharset.  Currently, translations only occur when longnames
  exist.  To translate, first convert from codepage to Unicode and then
  to the output character set.

Hmm. Yes, here problem described like it's only vfat read problem but it's
easy to guess that if no translation happens on read there are no translation
of write as well.

It's complex change. Thus it was not implemented for 2.2.
2.4 should work though (at least 2.3.36 already supported this).
