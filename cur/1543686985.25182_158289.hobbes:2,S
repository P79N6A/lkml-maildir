Thanks; I appreciate your comments. That's what's currently in place at the 
moment, and the lower the number of requeues the less it starves... 
Unfortunately, this also means that the shorter it takes a real interactive 
task to expire as well. This is the theme I'm currently working on though, as 
the starver gets rescheduled ahead of anything else and I've developed a way 
of letting other tasks sneak in ahead if it starts doing that. It needs more 
tuning but seems to work so far.
Cheers,
Con
