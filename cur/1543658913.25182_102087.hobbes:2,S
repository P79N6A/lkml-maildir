Yggdrasl (or however you spell it). Most binary files have
the date of Feb 26, 1996. Many text files have the date of
July 11, 1995. I have sources, many with the dates of
Aug 31, 1992:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     bin          4502 Aug 31  1992 CHANGES
-rw-r--r--   1 root     bin          1658 Aug 31  1992 README
-rw-r--r--   1 root     bin          2029 Aug 31  1992 brac.c
-rw-r--r--   1 root     bin         11258 Aug 31  1992 ch.c
-rw-r--r--   1 root     bin          3534 Aug 31  1992 charset.c

In those days very few persons even heard of GPL.
These are the only gpl or GPL strings found in any binaries.
sub showGPL {
last if (/^{END OF GPL COPYRIGHT}$/) ;
last if (/^{END OF GPL CONDITIONS}$/) ;
    &showGPL unless $QUIET ;
{END OF GPL COPYRIGHT}
{END OF GPL CONDITIONS}
   To appear in SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design 
  label .about.gpl3 -text "Pulic License (GPL)"
Note that "Public" is even spelled incorrectly!
Cheers,
