I second this kind of rework and even think that it is doable. This would avoid
exposing things to userspace before they are created for sure. I even had to
include dirty hacks in configfs to avoid exposing too much of such temporary
things, and I'm definitely not proud of this.
Unfortunately I don't have time to rework configfs this way at all.
