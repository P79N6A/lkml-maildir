Excuse me - sent half a response earlier.

Isn't it kind of pointless to not EXPORT a symbol if the symbol is still
declared globally in an include/linux/ header file? If the intent is to
prevent abuse of the symbol, then this doesn't do it, because I can just
statically compile my module into the kernel, and keep on using that
symbol.
It makes sense to me to remove the EXPORT of get_max_files only if the
intent is to eventually remove the get_max_files function from
include/linux/fs.h.
This would require that af_unix.c calculate the maximum number of
allowed open Unix sockets from information other than the
files_stat.max_files value is fs/file_table.c.
If that's the intent, then there's no point in disallowing AF_UNIX=m.
Doing this just so one can unEXPORT a symbol only fixes half the issue.
