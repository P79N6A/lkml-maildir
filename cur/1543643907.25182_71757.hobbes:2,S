Of course not. But people keep blaming the wrong routine.
I have said it a thousand times - nothing is wrong with get_pid().
Now proc_pid_readdir() takes a million times as long, so it would
be much more reasonable if people talked about it instead.
With 20000 processes it will visit 10^7 process structs
for one ps.

I looked at it and searched for base.c but didnt find it,
so concluded that the real problem was not addressed.

OK. So we now agree.
But it looks like your patch doesnt change this? Or did I overlook sth?
