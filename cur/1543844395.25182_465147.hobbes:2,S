I've talked to Luke about this, and I think we'll scratch this last 
patch for now.  I'll resubmit something smaller in scale which has only 
the necessary bits to get flat binaries working on the Blackfin, without 
the stack checking bits.  That should make merging easier and we can add 
the extra features later.
