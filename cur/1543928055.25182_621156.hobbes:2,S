Guessing the values does not work, because of the handle structure
defined by the hypervisor.

5*16*nr_ports+1+1=   >82. a ML16 has 4 adapters with up to 16 ports, so the

is not small anymore....
The device tree functions are currently not exported.
If you crashdump to a new kernel, will it get the device tree
representation
of the crashed kernel or of the initial one of open firmware?

I would hope this has the highest chance to actually work.
For this we would have to add a proper notifier chain.
Do you agree?

Firmware change? But that's not something you will get very soon.
