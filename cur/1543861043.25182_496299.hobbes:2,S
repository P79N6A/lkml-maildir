The "signed wrap is undefined" thing doesn't fit in this category
though:
-- It is an important optimisation for loops with a signed
    induction variable;
-- "Random code" where it causes problems is typically buggy
    already (i.e., code that doesn't take overflow into account
    at all won't expect wraparound either);
-- Code that explicitly depends on signed overflow two's complement
    wraparound can be trivially converted to use unsigned arithmetic
    (and in almost all cases it really should have used that already).
If GCC can generate warnings for things in the second bullet point
(and it probably will, but nothing is finalised yet), I don't see
a reason for the kernel to turn off the optimisation.  Why not try
it out and only _if_ it causes troubles (after the compiler version
is stable) turn it off.
to take is not to add the compiler flag, but to fix the code.

But it's not a language change -- GCC has worked like this
for a _long_ time already, since May 2003 if I read the
ChangeLog correctly -- it's just that it starts to optimise
some things more aggressively now.

Could be.  Who knows, without testing.  I'm just saying to
not add -fwrapv purely as a knee-jerk reaction.

I certainly never claimed so, that's all in Albert's mind it seems :-)
