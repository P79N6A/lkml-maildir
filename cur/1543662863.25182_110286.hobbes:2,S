I was one of the ones who was interested in making the statistics 
64-bit, and adding locking to do it right.  The solution finally 
appeared, many months ago:
The counters don't need to be 64-bit, because it is trivially possible 
for userspace to track the statistics, and to simply use the difference 
between two samples as the increment used in calculating whatever 
numbers you wish -- 64-bit SNMP MIB statistics were what I was 
interested in.  Wrapping is trivially handled by standard unsigned int 
arithmetic, among other methods.
If you really want the raw data, then use ethtool's NIC-specific stats 
facility, to retrieve raw statistics directly from the NIC.  [this of 
course requires driver modifications, but they are easy on modern NICs]
