See do_cpuid in arch/i386/kernel/cpuid.c for an example of how to do this
properly. It's a bit icky, but works. I've considered writing a generic
run_on_cpu() when I did the on_each_cpu() stuff, but asides from
cpuid.c, msr.c was the only other case I could find from a quick
grep around that really cared, so it didn't seem worth the effort.
