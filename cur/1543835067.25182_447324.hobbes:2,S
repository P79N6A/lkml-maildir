reiserfs would showup in the module list in such case, but _not_ in
the fs list. KLive records both the modules loaded _and_ the mounted
fs.
This is the code that records the FS:
	if CONFIG_FS:
		fs = {}
		for _fs in [ re.search(r'^[^\s]+\s[^\s]+\s([^\s]+)', x).group(1)
			     for x in file('/proc/mounts').readlines() ]:
			if _fs not in ['rootfs', 'proc', 'devpts']:
				fs[_fs] = None
		fs = ' '.join(fs.keys())
		KERNEL += str_append(fs)
/proc/mounts only lists the _mounted_ fs, not the fs loaded into the
kernel statically or with insmod.
