Won't comment on this argument, it might outweigh my point (but that's
not for me to say).

It doesn't require anyone to use the ISO characters.  The defkeymap.map
still contains compose rules for the ASCII sequences.

This is just a matter of adding compose rules.  The issue here is that
the dead keys themselves are producing the wrong characters.

No, this doesn't seem to be the case, unless I've missed something
important.  Because the dead_* are wrong, and I can't change them with a
keymap, afaik?  If I'm wrong, shoot me, then the patch is pointless.
