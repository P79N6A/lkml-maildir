Yes, it can have an Acked-by: Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>.

Which it can't in the corgi_bl case (excluding poking things
like /dev/mem). Its safe to assume it has exclusive access.

Right, I'd be against such a driver. On the embedded hardware we can
safely assume there is nothing else playing with the brightness settings
though and such a driver is perfectly valid.

If the backlight controls would then power off the backlight properly
that would be desirable as we've have a more standard interface.
