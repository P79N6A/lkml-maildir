Subject: [ANNOUNCE] New VST (tick elimination) code

We have just posted a new VST patch for the 2.6.10 kernel.  VST eliminates 
usless time base tick interrupts by, when the system is idle, looking forward in 
the time list to find the next time event.  The time base is then turned off and 
a hardware time is set up to wake the system when the next time event is to happen.
This version uses the local APIC timer(s) so it can sleep for several seconds.
Currently code exists for the i386 platform.  We expect code to support some of 
the ARM and the ppc in time.  Information is provided in the patch on how to do 
the arch dependent code.
All these wonders are to be found at: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/
(Note: the VST patch depends on the HRT (high res timers) patch.)
