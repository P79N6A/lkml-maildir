Subject: [PATCH] neofb: fix unblank logic interfering with lid toggled backlight
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/3/59

This is a fix for the most annoying problem that remained with neofb:
After "setterm -powersave powerdown" the console blanker will disable
the backlight after the given timeout expires. If this happens after the
lid has been shut, we read "LCD off" from the register and store that in
the driver. Once the lid is opened, the backlight turns on, but any key
press that would awaken the blanked console will switch the backlight
off again.
The workaround so far was to use the "display config toggle" Fn key
combo - once if no external display is attached, otherwise as often as
required to restore the desired display setup.
The following patch fixes the issue at least for the LCD-only case, with
no external monitor attached. Other display setup permutations are
pending further testing, but so far I can guarantee at least no negative
change in behaviour, if any at all.
