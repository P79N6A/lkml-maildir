Subject: [PATCH] driver-core: don't free devt_attr till the device is released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, devt_attr for the "dev" file is freed immediately on device
removal, but if the "dev" sysfs file is open when a device is removed,
sysfs will access its attribute structure for further access including
close resulting in jumping to garbled address.  Fix it by postponing
freeing devt_attr to device release time.
Note that devt_attr for class_device is already freed on release.
This bug is reported by Chris Rankin as bugzilla bug#8198.

Applies well to 2.6.20 and 21.  As sysfs-immediate-disconnect doesn't
seem to be included in 2.6.22, this should be included in linus#master
too (applies well there as well).
* This is the second post.  Something went wrong with the recipients
  list on the first posting.  Both are same.
Thanks.
