Yes, it usually assumes page table lock hold.

You can always use cmpxchg8 for that if you want. Just to make
it really atomic you may need a LOCK prefix, and with that the
cost is not much lower than a real spinlock.

The optimistic read function I posted would do this.
But you have to read multiple entries anyways, which could get
non atomic no? (e.g. to do something on a PTE you always need
to read PGD/PUD/PMD)
In theory you could do this lazily with retires too, but it would be probably
somewhat costly and complicated.

mmap_sem is only for VMAs. The page tables itself are protected by page table 
lock.
