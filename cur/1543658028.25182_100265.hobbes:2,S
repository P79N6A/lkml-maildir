I just compiled 2.4.20 with MODVERSIONS set, and all th ekernel symbols
came out as (according to /proc/ksyms)
     printk__R_ver_printk
(for example). System.map and the modules themselves are clean. No suffixes
on the symbol names, of any kind.
I couldn't load any modules, of course, not even with insmod -f.
The modules themselves depmod'ed fine against the System.map
Does anyone recognize this symptom? I presume it's a messed up binutils
or modutils. I did have to update binutils for some recent 2.5 kernels,
and I vaguely recall some warnings ...
 ii  binutils       2.12.90.0.1-4  The GNU assembler, linker and binary utiliti
 ii  util-linux     2.11b-4        Miscellaneous system utilities.
 ii  gcc            2.95.2-13.1    The GNU C compiler.
 ii  modutils       2.4.15-1       Linux module utilities.
I'll move gcc up to 2.95.3, but I don't think that should impact,
should it ..?
Peter
