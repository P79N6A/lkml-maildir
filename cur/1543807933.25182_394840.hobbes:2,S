It really is a fairly even toss up.  The usual argument for doing it
this way is that you will get a endless stream of arguments added to
fork+exec other wise.  Look of posix_spawn or the windows version if
you want an example.  Bits to clone are skirting the edge of a slippery 
slope.

What I have done which seems easier than creating new names is to refer
to the process which has the namespace I want to manipulate.

At the moment it is worth thinking about.  If the problem isn't
so bad that people aren't actively working on it we don't have to
solve the problem for a little while, just be aware of it.

In general it is simple.  For resource accounting, and for naming so
you can migrate a container with a nested container it is a question
you need to be slightly careful with.
