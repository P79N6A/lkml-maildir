No you don't. The kernel maintains compatibility with user-space
utilities. Just install the new kernel. You might need some new
tools to build it if your system is very, very old. Look at
.../linux/Documentation/Changes.

Util-linux provides a new version of mount and mkswap to overcome some
earlier limitations. There are other tools, also. You can continue to
use your existing tools if you don't need some special functionality.
In other words, you don't overwrite/replace stuff for no reason.

Shadow passwords are, and always have been, a separate user-space
facility.

Shadow passwords are a user-level facility that has nothing at all
to do with the kernel nor its maintenance. I believe that shadow
passwords were (are) a Sun idea that has been adapted to many
SYSV systems, including Linux.
