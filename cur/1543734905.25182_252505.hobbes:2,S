That is the first impression I've got. When I rebooted back to 2.6.9-rc1 
I went through /var/log/kern.log and found messages I sent earlier.

In my cases, I've got a DHCP enabled, racoon running. If I set up policies 
via script :
#!/usr/sbin/setkey -f
flush;
spdflush;
spdadd 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0[500] udp -P out none;
spdadd 0.0.0.0[500] 0.0.0.0 udp -P in none;
spdadd 192.168.3.3 192.168.3.2 any -P out ipsec
        esp/transport//require;
spdadd 192.168.3.2 192.168.3.3 any -P in ipsec
        esp/transport//require;
Mine laptop ip address is 192.168.3.3, and if I have 192.168.3.2 
connecting my laptop freezes ... Last linux kernel I used was 2.6.9-rc1-bk16 
and it was ok. 2.6.9-rc2 freezes laptop ...
Perhaps that is mixture of PREEMPT=y and ipsec ? dunno ...
