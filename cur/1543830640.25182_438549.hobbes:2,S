no, that was probably your assumption, the IPs are
assigned (in a perfectly normal way) to the interfaces
(e.g. eth0 carries some IPs for guest A and B, eth1
carries others for guest C). the way the linux network
stack works, local addresses (i.e. those of A,B and C)
will automatically communicate via loopback (as they
are local) while outbound traffic will use the proper
interface (nothing is changed here)
the difference in the lo patches is, that we allow to
use the 'localhost' ip range (127.x.x.x) by isolating
traffic (in this range) on the loopback interface
(which typically allows to have 127.0.0.1 and lo
visible inside a guest)

that might be, as we do not consider migration such
important as other folks do :)

no, guest A,B and C can all bind to *:80 and coexist
quite fine, given that they do not have any IP in
the intersection of their subsets (which is checked
at bind time)

actually I do not see why, unless the destination
has a conflict on the ip subset, in which case you
would end up with a migrated, but not working guest :)

that's fine, the only requirement would be that the
host has a superset of the IP addresses used by the
guests ...
