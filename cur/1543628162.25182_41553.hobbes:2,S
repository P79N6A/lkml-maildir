The FastTraK 100 TX2 has hardware raid (stripe/mirror) support, they
have a binary only driver (scsi/ft.o) which presents this array as
a scsi device... this is the level of function I was hoping was being
integrated.

The fasttrak also has hardware raid, while it works, it works realtively
well.
The current 2.4.18 code recognizes the card and provides vanilla IDE
access to the drives, unfortunately that isn't much use unless someone
wants to try and RE their block allocation on the disks... a decidedly
non-trivial endeavour I can assure you. ;(
