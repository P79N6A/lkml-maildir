There's some merit to this idea.  As Peter pointed out, an in-kernel cp isn't 
needed: mmap+write does the job.  The question is, how to avoid the 
copy_from_user and double caching of data?
Generic_file_write would have to determine that the source range is an mmap, 
then do the required xxx_get_block's (somehow) to determine the physical 
destination of the write, then finally use kio to dma the in-memory data to 
the destination.  (Never mind that get_block isn't a vfs method, that's a 
detail ;-)
The obvious problem is that, should somebody subsequently read the file, it's 
not in cache.  Oops, so much for the performance gain.  So some mechanism 
would have to be devised to get hold of the original page data by way of the 
destination inode, and to keep that consistent through the various 
combinations of events that can occur to the two files involved.  This is 
where things start to diverge quite a lot from the current page cache design, 
so if you're interested in pursuing this idea, a good way to start would be 
to find out why.
Before you put a lot of energy into it, you might consider measuring the 
actual cost of the memory copy versus the two disk transfers.
