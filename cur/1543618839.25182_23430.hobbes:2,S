Hello, Jens Axboe, Linus Torvalds and other linux kernel hackers.
Here is patch against 2.5.3-pre5 which removes io_request_lock.
But unfortunnually here is 1 file (drivers/scsi/3w-xxxx.c), 
which still use spinning locks with io_request_lock because of detect()
method, in which we cann't send Scsi_Host pointer. So this file must be
corrected in some other way.
Also ./drivers/mtd/mtdblock_ro.c file still use this lock.
So, please check and apply.
Thanks in advance for answers and suggestions.
