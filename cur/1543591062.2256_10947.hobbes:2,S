That is good and the thing other OS do since years. The call it
"DEVCAPS" or "device capabilities". They use bitmasks for this
(which might not be perfect).

Because we dont like to replace:
   if (st.device == MAJOR_1)
      bla
   else if ...
with
   if (!strcmp(st.device,"driver_1") )
      bla
   else if ...
?
There is no win doing it this way, because every time we add a
new driver that fits or change the name of one, we need add
support for it.
But the device majors are not needed for this, that's true ;-)
