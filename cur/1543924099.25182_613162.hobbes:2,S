No I didn't, but should have done so - cpu_index exists only
in the SMP case ...
I'll come up with a corrected fix (adding some ifdefs).

Yes, just in identify_cpu and not in its "early_" variant.

Hmm, will look at this as well.

You might be able to trigger it by using additional_cpus=<n> in your kernel
