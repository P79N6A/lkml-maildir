I don't think there is a kernel problem, there is an ioctl to delete
tunnels and it does work. if tun0 down does not delete the tunnel you
need to send down the ioctl as well. I don't know what user tools do
this for you, I have always done my own.
This is all the code ryou really need
{
	struct ifreq ifr;
	int fd;
        int i=0;
	if ((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) < 0) {
                SYSLOG(LOG_DAEMON | LOG_ERR, "Cannot open socket to close tunnel(s)\n");
                return;
        }
        sprintf(ifr.ifr_name,"tun%d", i);
        if( (ioctl(fd, SIOCDELTUNNEL, &ifr) < 0) {
                        SYSLOG(LOG_DAEMON | LOG_ERR, "Can't DELTUNNEL %s (%m)\n", ifr.ifr_name);
                }
