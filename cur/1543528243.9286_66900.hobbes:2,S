Hi,
How would the kernel get access to high memory?  Say above 16MB?  I need to
access this memory early on in the boot process.  Can I access it after
paging_init is called?  If so, what is the API?  Since I know the physical
address I want to read, I just need a virtual address mapping for it.  Can I
use kmap?  If so, will it work as soon as paging_init is called?
Best Wishes,
Lyle
