We've always had the kernel tied to specific ranges of kernels and binutils.
Given the nature of kernel code it is very hard to avoid and it takes a lot
of time to get a new compiler version supported and trusted.
In terms of needing a specific compiler well you need gcc or some variant of
it. Linux is written very much in GNU c
