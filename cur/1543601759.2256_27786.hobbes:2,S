Well, fsync_dev will flush anything on the dirty list.  Since 
blkdev_commit_write puts things on the dirty list, andrea's current 
code will flush changes through the page cache.
The biggest exception is blkdev_writepage directly submits the io instead
of marking the buffers dirty.  This means the buffers won't be on
the locked/dirty list, and they won't get waited on.  Similar problem
for direct io.
The fix shouldn't be too bad, I'll code it up...
