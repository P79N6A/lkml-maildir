Re-Sending:
Christoph,
The e-mail I sent out on Oct. 31st was bounced back, I re-send it again.
I see that scsi_scan_host_selected is in scsi_priv.h and currently is
not used by any other driver. The scsi_priv.h is not part of the include
dir (/include/scsi). One of the major Linux distro's don't even include
this file in /usr/src/kernels. Also it looks like at this time this
function may not be available (not exported?) for driver modules to use.
Even if I include scsi_priv.h I get "unknown symbol" for this function
while loading.
May be in the long run we can solve all these issues to call
scsi_scan_host_selected. However, the current implementation works fine
and has been tested by LSI and others. This implementation doesn't break
any protocol nor does it adversely affect any driver functionality.
In a future update soon I will modify the comment on proc/scsi and
remove the extra braces you have pointed out. Please accept the current
implementation/patches. 
Regards, 
Bo Yang

/proc/scsi/scsi is deprecated, so please don't recommend it here.
The proper way is the scan attribute of the scsi host.

This should show up in sysfs.

no need for the braces here.  This should be:
		if (megasas_mgmt_info.instance[i] &&
		    megasas_mgmt_info.instance[i]->host->host_no ==
host_no)

This is a rather complicated and fragile way to implement this feature.
I'd recomment to change the call to scsi_scan_host in megasas_io_attach
to something like:
	if (fast_load) {
		int channel;
		for (channel = 0; channel < MEGASAS_MAX_PD_CHANNELS;
		     channel++) {
			scsi_scan_host_selected(host, channel,
SCAN_WILD_CARD,
						SCAN_WILD_CARD, 0);
		}
	} else {
		scsi_scan_host(host);
	}
