Basically, statistic data are moved from the global kstat structure to 
the request_queue structures, and it is allocated/freed when the request 
queue is initialized and freed.  This way it is
1)self-controlled;
2)avoid the lookup step before the accounting, so it should be faster;
3)statistics implementation is not affected by the major/minor numbers;
4)able to gathering statistics for all disks while keep the memory needs 
minimized.
