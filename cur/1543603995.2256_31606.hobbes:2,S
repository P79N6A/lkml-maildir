This means, that 80% of all web site operators are too dumb to
configure a web server. Is it possible that your brand spanking new T1
addresses have no reverse name resolution? Are you using a proxy?
Look:
lm@bitmover   IP 1.2.3.4
    |
    |
"i want to surf to 
http://www.surf.xxx/"
    |
    |
    v
Website "www.surf.xxx"
"connect from 1.2.3.4" -> "Lookup for 4.3.2.1.IN-ADDR.ARPA"
                                       |
                                       |
                            1-15 Second timeout, "addr not found"
                                       |
                                       |
                                       v
                            send HTTP page to 1.2.3.4 anyway.

This has nothing to do with OSes, Linux or even a kernel. It is just
that most people on this net (and also most people who operate servers
or work at ISPs) are complete idiots that neither know how to operate
a webserver (set it to "name lookup off" and do address resolving for
web statistics offline) or an ip-space (how to setup a reverse
resolution).
I did consulting for an ISP that has > 50 Class C networks and not
_one_ had right forward and reverse resolution [1] as I arrived there.
