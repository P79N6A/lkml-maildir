Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ResCounter: Add res_counter_read_uint and use it in memory cgroup

These patches simplify the code required to report values from a
res_counter object in a cgroups control file.
The first patch adds res_counter_read_uint, which simply reports the
current value for a res_counter member.
The second replaces the existing mem_cgroup_read() with a simpler
version that calls res_counter_read_uint().
