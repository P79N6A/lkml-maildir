This is the last of my 2.3.x releases, and the next release will begin my 
pre-2.4.x series.
I hope this gets a lot of testing so we fix the stupid bugs before we go into 
the pre-2.4 series.
For people who want to give the native kernel the testing it needs, but don't 
have a spare box to do it on, this port would be a good way to go.  For those 
who aren't familiar with it, the user-mode port is a kernel port that runs in 
a set of Linux processes.  So, you can do some kernel testing without needing 
to dedicate a machine to the new kernel.
What's new in this release:
	updated to 2.3.51
	the virtual console xterms now disappear more intelligently
The patch and kernel are available from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist
.php?group_id=429
The kernel now includes iso-9660 and vfat so you can directly access CD-ROMs 
and floppies from inside the user-mode kernel.
