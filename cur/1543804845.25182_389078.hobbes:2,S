Lightly tested with a separate O= and M= directory and a copy of the entire 
fs/ tree; all seems to work for me. The only issue I had was with 
fs/xfs/Kbuild, which reads:
[] include $(srctree)/$(obj)/Makefile-linux-2.6
This should get changed as below to work equally well in and out of the tree:
[] include $(src)/Makefile-linux-2.6
> make -C $KERNELSRC M=`pwd` bar.lst
That's what triggered the bug report for me: people expect those targets to 
work also for external modules, and the patch fixes them. Thank you very 
much, Sam!
