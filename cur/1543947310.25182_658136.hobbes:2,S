Sorry, I don't get it. You are going to remove the (somehow)
working driver, while there are known problems with the new
one? Why? To me it sounds like _breaking old but working code_
to get _more bug reports on the new code_. But, what was the
goal providing users with working drivers, or getting more
bug reports?
And please look at the problem from a user's view point. I'm
happily using the 2.6.23 kernel. The bcm43xx driver is the
only one available. And it works somehow (well, no s2ram).
Now I upgrade to the 2.6.24 kernel. I see there is a new 
b43 driver and try it.
For some reason it does not work, even after I follow the
firmware upgrading instructions. Not a big deal, I clearly
understand that you have to work with reverse-engineered
specs and even with good specs, bugs happen, no problem.
I'll try to debug it in the weekend and maybe will send a
bug report or patch.
But right now I have other business, sorry. The problem is,
now also the old (but not now marked as deprecated) driver
stops working.
If this is not a repgession, than I don't know what is.
And if it is a regression, it should be fixed at least in the
2.6.24.y series, do you agree?
I have provided a patch that I believe is trivial, that I have
tested with all possible config option combinations I thought
were possible, and that fixes the regression. If you have a
reason to believe it is wrong, please say it, I won't be
offended. If there is a problem with the patch, I'll gladly
fix and resend it. 
This Nack leaves me with one option - to switch back to 2.6.23.
Sorry, no testing, probably more bugs not found in 2.6.24. ;(
