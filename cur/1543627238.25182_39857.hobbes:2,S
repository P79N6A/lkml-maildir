I (we) are (ab?)using the code to enqueue/dequeue arbitary
packets to a qdisc attached to a software device (imq)
for doing traffic control over multiple interfaces / ingress
traffic control with egress qdiscs, in that case 
skb->dev != qdisc->dev.
Although in normal circumstances the assumption may be right
it fails in this case. It would be nice if you apply my patch
as it doesn't changes anything and enforces correct behaviour
in cases like mine.
Bye,
