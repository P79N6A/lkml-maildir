|In addition, Compaq will soon introduce new pricing geared to
|encourage Linux users to "step up" from Intel to Alpha chips, Berman
|said, targeting Alpha-Linux primarily at technical computer users who
|can fully appreciate the number-crunching abilities of the Alpha. Next
|on the list will be Internet service providers or companies wanting to
|set up internal Web sites. Third will be educational markets,
|according to Berman.
Be careful.
Is it surprising to lead linux to a Alpha from x86,
and soon someone will pull the plug on alpha chips.
