It is safer to evaluate the graph at link time in case somebody
mistakenly codes a dependency loop, that is an abort case.  Finding
that you have a loop at load time and aborting the kernel is a little
too drastic for my tastes.
In any case it is academic.  Linus insists on link order being
explicitly and completely specified by the programmer and he likes the
link order being implied by Makefile order.  So there is no point in
working on a better system.
