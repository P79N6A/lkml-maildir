Async IO completion signals use the same union as queued signals, so
si_sigval is still usable.  If you want the same field for timer
signals, then change the _timer union in siginfo so that si_sigval is at
the right place.  You can't just change the queued siginfo structure,
since that is already used by LinuxThreads.

libaio-style async IO is defined in posix to use the normal queued
signals mechanism, so si_sigval doesn't need any change for that.

glibc uses them internally.  No can change.
