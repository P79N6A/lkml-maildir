A generic IA64 kernel requires (at least) the ACPI and NUMA options in
order to run on all the IA64 platforms out there.  Omitting those
options and relying on the user to set them by hand is going to cause
more problems.
If anything, there should be more options being set as a side effect of
selecting IA64_GENERIC, including ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE,
ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE, PCI and even SMP.
