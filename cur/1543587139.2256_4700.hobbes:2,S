It depends on your workload if you can trade that in. e.g. when a few hundred TCP
sockets are active a lot of timer ticks will run some timer handler. Also generally
the kernel has quite a lot of timers. There is some reduction on a idle system. That
is no doubt useful for VM/UML/VMware where you can have idle sessions hanging around, 
but otherwise it's not very interesting to optimize idle systems (except maybe for 
power saving purposes)
