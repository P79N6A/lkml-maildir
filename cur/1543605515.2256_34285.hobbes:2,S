a lot of VM work has been done, in particular to solve your problem. 
Two solutions have emerged, one in Alan's tree and one in Linus's.
I suggest you try one (or -- even better -- both).  I would be surprised
if your problem wasn't fixed.  The newest release in Alan's tree is
2.4.12-ac3 and it is running great here.  Linus has released a
2.4.13-pre5.
