If using something with slashes in it as a file name component isn't
problematic, then by all means create a single file system object named
"a/b" where "a" doesn't refer to a parent directory and tell us all how.

Huh? The block device's name is exported directly via /proc/partitions,
but then also used as a file name component in sysfs, and also procfs
via reiserfs. How do you propose fixing this without adding an
additional field to genhd? Adding a helper function is essentially the
same thing as this patch other than it being open coded, and I'm not
getting the impression that the open coding is your issue.

In terms of file system names, I have been making that distinction. In
terms of block devices, the name consists of only one component. More below.

Splitting the block device names with / is applying file system path
name rules to the block device name, when they don't. The entire point
of this is that "cciss/whatever" refers to a single object in the block
layer, but when you apply file system rules, it becomes two. This is not
the desired interpretation, which is why we need to replace the pathname
separator in the name. ReiserFS is the component that is choosing to use
the block device name as a pathname component and is responsible for
making any translation to that usage.
