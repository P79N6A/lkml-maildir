Subject: [PATCH] Print error code in page faults
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/24/3

When a page faults comes from a kernel space, the printed summary
leaves us clueless about what kind of access was being tried (which
is encoded in the error_code variable).
Having it promply available may ease debugging in a bunch of
situations.
