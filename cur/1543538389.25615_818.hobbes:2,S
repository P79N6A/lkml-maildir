And just how do you suggest that be done?
The current process requesting a memory page? - what if it is init (boom,,
reboot). What if it is inetd... or syslog (trying to get a buffer for the
OOM message :)... Any non-root process ? what if it is a simple telnet
attack (hundreds of telnet connections... no logins, just lots of telnetd
daemons...) or the web server (same situation, although some do a better
job of not exceeding limits).
This has been covered several times over the last two years. It will not
go away until there is resource accounting, and user resource accounting
enforcement implemented. That is being worked on, and will get better when
the VM changes stablize.
 There is a patch in the mailing list archives for 2.2 (14?) that was a
demonstration of some limits - the system was set to not allow users to exceed
90% (or so) of the memory resources. Root didn't have limits. This patch does
not work for 2.3/2.4 kernels. It even had the option to disable the limit
enforcement (current limit) enforce limit on user, enforce limit on user and
root. The patch doesn't fix everything, but does cover about 80% of the
cases.
