I learned of this 12-days past discussion on the "kernel traffic" digest.

The Linux boot code may meet your needs fine, but especially if you
are developing a quite different kernel, you should take a look at the
OSKit, that we developed for the exact purpose of supporting
experimental operating systems without getting in your way.

It's easy to use, and all the booting is taken care of for you, comes
up in 32-bit mode, etc.  Provides Linux device drivers if you want
drivers, and has a large choice of other components, all separated
with no or minimal dependencies.  There is continuing work on it, both
research and development.
Let us know if you use it, and/or need some help here and there.
