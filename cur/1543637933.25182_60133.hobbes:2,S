What would you suggest as an alternative API?  The main point of multiplexing 
is that ios can be submitted in batches, which can't be done if the ios are 
submitted via individual syscalls, not to mention the overlap with the posix 
aio api.

That's the old cancellation API.  Anyways, the core is pretty much ready, so 
don't bother with this patch.
