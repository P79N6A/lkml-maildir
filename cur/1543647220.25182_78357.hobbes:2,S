I'm looking for people who is brave (or stupid) enough to try 2.5
and who has network card(s) driven by one of the following drivers:
3c505.c
3c515.c
82596.c
at1700.c
depca.c
ewrk3.c
lp486e.c
ni5010.c
ni65.c
smc9194.c
These drivers currently don't compile. I'm fixing them but
can't test on a live hardware. Anyone?
