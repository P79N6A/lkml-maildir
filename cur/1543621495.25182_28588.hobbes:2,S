==== Problem One ====
Hi all.  I started noticing the "clock slowdown" problem when I started with
2.4.x series of kernels, and described it in a past post.  In summary, under
framebuffer mode, when the interrupts are disabled, they don't get re-enabled
quickly enough to make sure the system clock keeps up.  I was told about a
patch that would help to solve this, I applied said patch (2.4.3) then, when
the kernel updated to 2.4.11, I was pleased to see the Andrew Morton patch
integrated into the kernel.  
However, I'm noticing the slowdown again, though not to the same extent.  I
took the kernel up to 2.4.17 but I need to do some further tests to see what
else I can ferret out. 
==== Problem Two ====
Also, what are the plans for replacing the virt_to_bus / bus_to_virt
functions?  The sourcecode basically says to use pci_map functions, but, being
almost a kernel illiterate (I know how to compile, apply patches, and not much
else) I don't know how to get started on converting.  I thought that
pci_resource_{start,end,len} may also be needed too.  Am I right?
Again, thanks for all your time.  I read KT and found out about why my 2.5.4
kernel refused to compile, fixed that, fixed another couple of things, then
came up against this bus_to_virt problem, which I'd like to get fixed before I
go anywhere with 2.5 - understandable as I just aout live for my 160x64 text
screen 8-)  I use a VESA framebuffer, as the SiS framebuffer code hasn't been
extended to include the 5597/5598 yet.
Must go...now I can FINALLY send this off, six months after originally
composeng it.
