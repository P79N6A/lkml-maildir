uClibc currently only runs on arm, i386, m68k, mips, powerpc, sh,
and v850, with full shared lib support on arm, i386, and powerpc.
Porting to a new arch typically involves writing just a few asm
files.  I don't bother with anything non-Linux...

uClibc does tiny static stuff just fine.  Though these days,
uClibc passes POSIX conformance tests (with some exceptions for
stupid things which have been omitted).

uClibc currently has shared lib support only on arm, i386, and powerpc.
There is a library reducer script (to include only needed
symbols) in uClibc/extra/libstrip/libstrip which does a fine job.
I personally think busybox + uClibc are ideal for building
initramfs stuff, since you can build everything you need into 
a single multi-call binary (eliminating the need for shared libs
in most cases).

Well, I do my best.  :)
As for ease of building the library, most people can just copy
the Config file into place and compile.  I build a fake
gcc-wrapper toolchain, so using the library is as simple as 
'make install' then running 'CC=/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin/gcc make'
I think one big advantage uClibc has in the "not suck"
department, is that it uses the header files from glibc 2.2.4
(with minor changes), meaning that for most apps, if it compiles
with glibc it will compile with uClibc.

Ok.  here I am.   Work with me.  :)

If folks have requirements and goals, I'm very interested in
hearing them...
