In otherwords, you admit that it's buggy as you have to add a
condition to get it to agree with the POSIX specification.

Neither do I, but that's not what's in question here...

What's wrong with false complying with the POSIX specs even when it is
supplied with arguments, like true already does?
Here's a patch file to bring it into compliance:

Perhaps somebody should forward that patch to 'Professor' Stillman...
Best wishes from Riley.
