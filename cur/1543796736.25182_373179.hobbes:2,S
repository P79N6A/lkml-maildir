Depending upon what speed his CPU is, he should be able to achieve close
to 40MB/s with LZF compression (assuming 50% compression and a CPU fast
enough that the disk continues to be the bottleneck).

But so does doing it from userspace - you then have to make the pages
available to the userspace program, implement encryption there, provide
safety nets in case userspace dies unexpectedly and so on. There is a
cost to encryption that occurs regardless of where we do the
compressing.

For swap?
