NTFS allows all 16-bit characters in filenames, including 0x0000.
Nothing is disallowed. The NT kernel's native API uses counted
Unicode strings. The strings can be huge too, like 128 kB.
So there isn't _any_ safe delimiter.
Win32 will choke on 0x0000 and a few other things, allowing a
clever person to create apparently inaccessible files.
