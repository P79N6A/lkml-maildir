M68k has m68kspkr, which beeps through the m68k beep abstraction.
The only reason there's a 1193182 in drivers/input/misc/m68kspkr.c is for
userspace compatibility with ia32. So please don't introduce
include/asm-m68k/8253pit.h and keep CLOCK_TICK_RATE for m68k like it is.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
