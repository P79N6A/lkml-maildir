   I prefer that option, expect that it changes the name of a module.  Not
   that we haven't done that before ...
   A module name of af_unix would be much better, like af_packet.  It
   would require changing the name of af_unix.c (source and conglomerate
   objects cannot have the same basename) and a change to modutils to map
   net-pf-1 to af_unix.
I don't like this solution, please fix this right and get rid of the
limitations at their source.
If I name a module "foo" and this causes "fo" to become a defined
CPP symbol in when compiling the sources for that module, that is
completely broken!
net/unix is just a trite example.  How about a driver for device "foo"
that has a member "foo" in one of it's structures?  They have to get
this undef thing too or rename their module, that's rediculious.
