Ah, but very shortly after you're I/O bound due to paging, there's
usually a need for lots of zero pages.  This happens whenever any
program is started up.  Why not spend the paging I/O time preparing
those zero pages?

You can use MTRRs (probably too slow to set up), or there is a
page-table variation where the MTRR type bits can be encoded in the page
table bits (as fast as mapping a page, and I don't remember the
acronym).  I think the latter predates KNI, so you might have it.

I do not have enough RAM for any value of -j to be perfect.  I only have
64MB.  Actually I get plenty of swapping with -j3 even on a 128MB
machine.  Must be because I'm foolish enough to have a Netscape and an
Emacs running at the same time.
