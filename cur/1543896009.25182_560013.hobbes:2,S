Unfortunately I do not have a 4-way machine, but a dual core was enough
to show the problem:
./stream_test 127.0.0.1

Which makes perfect sense, in that r/w locks are degraded to regular
exclusive locks on -rt.
So I guess you're wanting to go help out with the RCU-ification of
whatever it is that this lock protects. :-)
