I agree it would be nice to get the ID via user space, but it is not that
hard to get the ID, and trying the various SCSI INQUIRY pages that supply 
the ID is not complicated. Putting ID code (including hotplug hooks) into
user space is probably more complex. I would also like the ID at scan time
for multi-path use so we don't have to allocate extraneous Scsi_Devices,
and later coalesce them.
Mike Sullivan's driverfs patch for SCSI (without any device naming) includes
code to look up an ID, and store the ID in driverfs; he was working on
a patch for 2.5.21.
FYI the various SCSI ID pages and such are described in the SCSI primaray
command for example the following:
ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/spc3/spc3r07.pdf
Near page 316 (section 8.6) are descriptions for INQUIRY VPD page 0x80
and 0x83.

Any SCSI device can return an ID (i.e. INQUIRY VPD page 0x80 or 0x83),
so the logic need not be in sd. I don't know how removable media should
be handled (not a SCSI device being added/removed from the system), for
tape this is probably not an issue.

usb-storage could emulate VPD page 0x83 to return the GID, and that could
then be used by the mid-layer or a user level program to extract an ID.
