Agreed. When I looked at the pile of crap in drivers/staging/winbond
at first, it was more or less impossible to even say what the hell the
driver was doing. That was because (a) there were tons of obfuscating
wrappers carried over from Windows driver APIs and (b) there's so much
dead code it's not even funny!
So yeah, doing a "real review" on that monster before we get the
basics right would probably be a complete waste of time.
