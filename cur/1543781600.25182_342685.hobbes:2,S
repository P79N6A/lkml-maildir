Subject: FPU-intensive programs crashing with floating point exception on Cyrix MII

My machine (Cyrix MII PR300 CPU, PCPartner TXB820DS board with i430TX 
chipset) exhibits a really weird problem:
When I run a program that uses FPU, it sometimes crashes with "flaoting 
point exception" - for example, when playing MP3 files using any player. 
Or with Prime95 - 
http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm
 - the "torture 
test" does not crash but shows "fatal error" in less than 10 minutes.
It might be something like this:

or this
http://lists.slug.org.au/archives/slug/2000/11/msg00343.html
The problem appears on 2.4.x kernels and 2.6.x kernels. It works fine in 
Windows 98 - it can play MP3s and run Prime95 for hours without any 
problems.
I've tracked it down to math_error() in arch/i386/kernel/traps.c and 
"fixed" it (I really don't know anything about FPU programming). The 
patch is attached. It fixes my system - with the patch, I can play MP3s 
fine and Prime95 runs without any problems too.
Does anyone know why these exceptions happen and/or what's the correct 
solution?
