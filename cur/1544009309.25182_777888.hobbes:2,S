I already thought of that.
but isn`t it that not just a matter of gcc exploitability ?
what about uploading specially crafted makefiles, setup-scripts or kernel-source 
containing backdoors.....?
besides hacking into the build servers - the problem i see is that other users download 
binary code from a such potentially compromised system and/or may download kernel-
modules which could (!?) contain binary code compiled from untrusted sourcecode....
maybe BugTraq ML is a better place to discuss.....
