Hmmm... Still no fallback? Weird, would you apply the other patch that 
filters the __GFP_THISNODE flag and try again? Could you try to add some 
printk's to the page allocator to figure out what is going on there? Or is 
it clear that the node is overallocated?
Could it be that the node online mask contains a node that has not been 
bootstrapped yet?
Dont you have someone who can debug this? This is kind of an awkward back 
and forth with me guessing what the system does. Someone with knowledge 
about the way NUMA is implemented in the arch code?
