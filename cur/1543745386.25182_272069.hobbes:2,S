Yes, they are only allocated within our own code. I use "allocation"
loosely here -- in the case of our network backend driver, the page
fragments that we pass into the network subsystem are actually
temporary mappings of other domains' RAM -- not allocated from this
kernel's heap at all.

We don't hook into the slab allocator, but into the page_alloc zoned
buddy allocator: so in your example replace kmalloc() with
get_free_page(), and kfree() with free_page(). The point is that we
can't always use 'special_xen_free_page()' because the page's refcnt
may fall to zero within a generic Linux subsystem (e.g., the network
stack). So we need to be able to hook of free_page().
It would be great if we could have a "destructor hook" per page that
points at the relevant heap-free function to use, but that'd never fly
here. This is the best we can do with absolutely minimal source
impact, and no run-time impact on other arches.

The whole of our foreign_page.h was in page-flags.h. Do you think the
whole lot should go back, or just the bit definition?

We hacked around it in this case because the PageForeign stuff was
entirely within page_alloc.c and page-flags.h. Since only Xen used it
we were asked if we could have less non-arch source impact and this is
what we came up with. :-) Point taken on PG_foreign though.
