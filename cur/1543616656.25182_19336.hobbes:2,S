Hello,
I am continue looking at __FUNCTION__ use in context where it 
concatenates with another string. This time I attached little patch that 
just fixes /include subtree. This patch do not change format of messages 
printed, it just uses __FUNCTION__ as gcc 3 suggests.
Patch is against 2.4.18-pre3
All /include subtree is fixed, except /include/asm-mips/system.h (it 
requires small changes in /arch/mips/kernel/traps.c)
I will come with separate fix for it, it's easy to do, I just wonder 
whether this issue is interesting and patches going to be used. 
Otherwise, I don't want to spend time for this technical and not very 
interesting work.
P.S. Marcelo, if you are reading it - your opinion, is this issue worth 
the effort?
