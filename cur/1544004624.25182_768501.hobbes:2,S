Yes, but I was talking about the original percpu API: 
alloc_percpu/free_percpu/per_cpu_ptr.  That's the only bit that counts, as 
it's the only bit that's used.  Yes, the percpu_alloc should die.
Just convert *that API* to your new implementation, and drop all the 
conversion patches.  I said this back in June.

Sure, but we could convert those today to alloc_percpu etc.
