Nope, that's a _long_ time ago. It may well have been simply a MM bug that
got fixed long since, ie something like
 - dirty writeout happens
 - writeout needs memory
 - buffer.c tries to clean up pages
 - hang.
However, some of the comments in this thread seem to just simply not be 
correct:

The dirty bit is not cleared, so the changes _are_ written to disk. 
Eventually. The fact that something tests "unlocked" instead of "dirty" is 
not the fault of ll_rw_block(), and never has been.
So the bug is not in ll_rw_block(), but in the waiter. If you expect to be
able to wait for dirty blocks, you can't do what the code apparently does.  
You can't assume that "unlocked" means "no longer dirty". Unlocked means
unlocked, and dirty means dirty.
If you want to synchronously wait for dirty blocks, you should do 
something like
	lock_buffer();
	.. dirty buffer..
	mark_buffer_dirty();
	unlock_buffer();
	ll_rw_block(..)
Btw, it is probably a really bad idea to just do
	wait_and_write()
	{
		wait_for_buffer(..);
		ll_rw_block(..);
	}
for things like this. It's just a better idea to lock the buffer before 
making the modification.
Of course, these days, if you really want to, you can just use submit_bh() 
etc instead. At which point _you_ are responsible for all the locking and 
unlocking.
