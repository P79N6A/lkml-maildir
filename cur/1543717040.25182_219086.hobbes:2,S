Hi,
Glad to see this happening. My filesystems are mostly reiser
these days, but if I have some time/occasion, I will try your patch.
Regarding semantics etc. I have read 
http://lwn.net/Articles/77972/.
I think most difficulties arose from inode numbers as a concept.
Usage of inode number is a historic UNIX misfeature.
AFAIK it is almost exclusively used for determining whether
two files are really the same: same (dev,ino) => same file.
Usage:
* diff wants this to avoid diffing file against itself.
* du wants this in order to not count file twice.
* cp/tar wants this in order to preserve hardlinks.
For cowlinks it is a bit different:
* diff still dont need to compare cowlinked file.
* cp/tar aren't required to detect cowlinks, may do this
  as an optimization.
* du: I am not sure... analogous to sparse files?
In essense, diff wants to ask kernel "are these files have
identical contents?" while tar/cp ask "are these files
hardlinked together?". du asks "are these share storage"?
Original UNIX folks had to make inode number only an advisory
indicator, meaning "if ino1 != ino2, files are _definitely_ not
linked", and a syscall is_hardlinked(fd1,fd2), intended
for use when inodes are equal.
That is probably unfixable now, but you can avoid making similar
error. Provide is_cowlinked(fd1,fd2) syscall. Pity you will
have to use different inode numbers for cowlinks (due to tar/cp),
and this won't fly:
diff.c:
...
if(ino1==ino2 && is_cowlinked(fd1,fd2))
	skip_diff();
...
diff will have to use if(is_cowlinked(fd1,fd2)), i.e. one
extra syscall, always. Anyway, for diff that's not tragic,
savings from not doing diff are still very substantial.
For du, that would hurt.
Per-block cow filesystems will open another can of worms
for diff and du. ;)
P.S. If is_hardlinked() is introduced too, tar/cp can be
updated to use that, and we can slowly drift into right
direction (of not assuming "equal inos => hardlinked file").
I think too much people will disagree with me, and this
won't happen.
