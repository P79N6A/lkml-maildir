If users put it in the kernel bugzilla its gets lost because most of the
bugzilla isn't set up to route bugs to maintainers. In the unlikely event
it arrives there or it gets posted to linux-kernel the only reply is
"report it to your distributor"

I'd prefer not. I get reports from people about drivers that got "lost"
by vendors, regularly. Nor am I pointing fingers at specific vendors here,
last month I sorted out a two year old "lost in Red Hat Bugzilla" kernel
bug for example.
