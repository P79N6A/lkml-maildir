I see an anachronism here.
Most 8 MB systems will need a boot floppy, since they are too old
to support CD-ROM boot. When I bought my 133 MHz Pentium system with
32 MB of RAM in 1996, I did not get the CD-ROM boot feature. Since an
8 MB system would be even older (perhaps 1994), there is little need
to worry about CD-ROM boots in 8 MB.
Distributions ought to go with a 2.88 MB image on the CD-ROM,
possibly with a kernel patched to support bzip2 compression.
The CD-ROM boot image should assume that 16 MB is available.
Since boot floppy creation is already for nerds only, one might
bring back support for 4 MB machines. Slackware used to (still does?)
let the user create and enable swap before starting the setup program.
