  All I had available was a 2.4.19-rc2, but your patch applies,
with offsets, against it.  2 non-critical failed hunks were simple
enough by hand.
  Builds, boots, runs -- has survived 2 bonnie++ runs and normal
user load for the last few hours with no problems.  I've been
avoiding use of 2.5 on this box, but if you need to see this against
2.5.26, let me know and I can convert this box this weekend.
  System is SMP, dual PCI BusLogic BT-958's, 2.4.19-rc2 with
O(1) scheduler patch and your BusLogic DMA patch.  BusLogic
is non-module, the boot disk hangs off the first adapter.  Let
me know if you need specific testing.
