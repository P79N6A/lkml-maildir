Subject: 2.4.10-pre11: alsaplayer skiping during kernel build (-pre10 did not)

Hello Andrea,
I gave your new vm a try and I have to report a problem. System is an
Athlon 1200 with 256MB memory. Workload:
1. top refreshing every second reniced to -10
2. alsaplayer -n -q -r *.wav
3. make -j4 bzImage modules
The problem is that with 2.4.10-pre11 alsaplayer is skiping very much.
Almost every ten seconds and then the break seems to be relatevily long
(like >1s). With 2.4.10-pre10 I noticed alsaplayer skiping once or twice
during the whole build (which takes about 6min) for a very short time
(like a cd player skipping over a scratch). Here is the diff output of
time -v of the make -j4 command:
