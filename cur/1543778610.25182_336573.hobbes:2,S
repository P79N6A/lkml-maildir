Thomas has done all that; it's on kernel.org already.

Hm, OK. That works and can also be used for the "fake _absence_ of
parent" thing -- if I'm space-constrained and want only the history back
to some relatively recent point like 2.6.0, I can do that by turning the
2.6.0 commit into an orphan instead of also using all the rest of the
history back to 2.4.0.
