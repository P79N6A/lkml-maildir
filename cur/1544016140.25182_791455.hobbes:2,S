Yes.

Our driver unfortunately does not use the DMA API, but it clearly
should. What this means in your case is that you would need to port
the freescale DMA engine driver to the host side, to operate on the
PCI device. Not sure about how specifically this would work on fsl
hardware, but it seems generally doable.
