This is very much *NOT* reasonable.  In fact, screwing around with the
syntax of the mem= parameter is poison.  I know it has already
happened, and those changes need to be reverted and the new stuff
moved to a different option.
The mem= option is unique in that it is an option that affects both
the boot loader and the kernel.  Therefore, ITS SYNTAX MUST NOT
CHANGE.
