Well it only takes about 250 lines to make a new fs these days, but a
single netlink message would probably be smaller :)

The RDMA-loving people need to get together and hammer out a proposal
that the network people can laugh at and shoot down all at once :)
Ok, maybe not shoot down, but they do need to get together and come up
with some kind of solution, add-hok implementations in a bunch of
different drivers, in a bunch of different ways is not the proper thing
to do, no matter _how_ different the hardware works at the lower levels.
