Uh, never mind.  It does the right thing.  CONFIG_SECURITY=n means we
use capabilities, but CONFIG_SECURITY=y and CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=n 
means we use dummy.  The following patch fixes the Kconfig accordingly.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file caps: don't show FILE_CAPABILITIES option when not relevant
FILE_CAPABILITIES are relevant when CONFIG_SECURITY=n, but not when
CONFIG_SECURITY=y && CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=n.  So make
CONFIG_SECURITY_FS_CAPABILITIES depend on the right conditions.
