The GNOME stuff is mostly userspace problems not kernel space, and some
of it is tool problems (lack of tools to lay binaries out so they stream
from disk, lack of tools to put all the fixups in the same few pages).
Gnome noticably improved when prelinking in gnu tools began to work
To do a meaningful kernel comparison you need to look at 2.2/2.4/2.5
with the same user space setup. 
As to the 486's. There is optimisation work for gnome and especially
startup going on. Seems its a bit slow on those old legacy sparc64
contraptions ;)
