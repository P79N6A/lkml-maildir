It was PPC64, if that helps.

Well, I think it depends on the workload a lot. However fast your TLB is,
if we move from "every cacheline read requires is a TLB miss" to "every
cacheline read is a TLB hit" that can be a huge performance knee however
fast your TLB is. Depends heavily on the locality of reference and size
of data set of the application, I suspect.
