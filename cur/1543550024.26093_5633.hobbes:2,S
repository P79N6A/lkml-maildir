I don't want to take a position on the matter of C vs. C++ in the Linux
kernel. However, I *have* done some realistic work to show that C++ does
not inherently introduce bloat. (I do my embedded work in C++.)

Of course, I write my Linux drivers (and GIMP plug-ins) in C, not C++, and
that's fine, too. I'm just glad it's not Scheme:-)
