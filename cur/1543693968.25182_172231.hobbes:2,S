Due to a signal fluctuation, the access port "went out of range", and this was 
interpreted as the card having been ejected.  (Removing the card would 
require half an hour with a screwdriver; it's built in to this laptop.)
I tried "ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up", and it said no such device...
Logically, the link status toggled.  This should be no different than 
unplugging and plugging in a cat 5 cable.  It is NOT synonymous with a 
cardbus eject...
