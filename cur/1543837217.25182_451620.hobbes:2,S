Not quite.  It's more of, "if I suspend everynight instead of leaving it
running or shutting it down, it will do this" or "if I power off at night
or just leave it running, it will not do this".

Yeah, but still, the keyboard gets pretty hot too, and I'm actually more
worried about damaging something that is close by than damaging the CPU
itself.

hmm, I have /proc/acpi/fan/ but nothing is in it. Here's some configs of
interest:
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP_PROC_FS=y
# CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP_PROC_SLEEP is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_AC=m
CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY=m
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=m
CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_HOTKEY is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_FAN=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m
CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU=y
CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_ASUS is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_IBM=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_IBM_DOCK is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_TOSHIBA is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR=2001
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_CONTAINER=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_SBS is not set
$ lsmod |grep fan
fan                     6916  0
$ sudo modprobe ibm_acpi
$ ls /proc/acpi/ibm/
bay        bluetooth  driver     led        thermal
beep       cmos       hotkey     light      video
No fan there
and still no fan stuff in /proc/acpi/fan.
