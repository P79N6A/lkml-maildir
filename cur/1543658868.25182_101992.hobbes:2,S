IDE is all broken still and will take at least another three months to
fix - before we get to 'improve'. The entire tty layer locking is terminally
broken and nobody has even started fixing it. Just try a mass of parallel
tty/pty activity . It was problematic before, pre-empt has taken it  to dead, 
defunct and buried. 
Most of the drivers still don't build either.
I think its important that we get to the stage that we can actually say
- It compiles (as close to all the mainstream bits of it as possible)
- The stuff that is destined for the bitbucket is marked in Config and people
  agree it should go
- It works (certainly the common stuff)
- Its statistically unlikely to eat your computer
- It passes Cerberus uniprocessor and smp with/without pre-empt
Otherwise everyone wil rapidly decide that ".0-pre" means ".0 as in Windows"
at which point you've just destroyed your testing base.
Given all the new stuff should be in, I'd like to see a Linus the meanie
round of updating for a while which is simply about getting all the 2.4 fixes
and the 2.5 driver compile bugs nailed, and if it doesn't fix a compile bug
or a logic bug it doesn't go in.
No more "ISAPnP TNG" and module rewrites please
