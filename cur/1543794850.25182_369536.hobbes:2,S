I could live with that altthough there is something I would like to

If you put something is a /etc/fstab, that will be mounted by init
scripts, the uid/gid credentials attached with the mount request is of
course root.root (which is wht is see with "ls file" BTW). 'I'm just
surprised that with the perm option, my identity seems to change, on the
client side, between the two commands : if the file is marked locally as
created by root.root, I should still be root.root for the next command!
Side question for my understanding : when I specify  the credentials
(like I did) (credentials=/home/ceva6380/.sambaShareId) and that the
user name exist in the local /etc/passwd, I'm surprised to have to add
the uid=getuidfrom(name) again. I admit, user name on the windows server
may be different than on the client, but to put a valid uid/gid it must
exist on the client system anyway and be consistent with the current
user identity no?
