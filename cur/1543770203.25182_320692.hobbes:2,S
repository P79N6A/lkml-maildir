I'd say the following patches of mine might are candidates : 
atm-nicstar-remove-a-bunch-of-pointless-casts-of-null.patch
cosmetic-fixes-for-example-programs-in-documentation-cdrom-sbpcd.patch
dont-do-pointless-null-checks-and-casts-before-kfree.patch
get-rid-of-redundant-null-checks-before-kfree-in-arch-i386.patch
kfree-cleanups-for-drivers-firmware.patch
kfree-cleanups-in-ixjc.patch
remove-pointless-null-check-before-kfree-in-sony535c.patch
remove-redundant-null-check-before-before-kfree-in.patch
remove-redundant-null-checks-before-kfree-in-sound-and.patch
streamline-preempt_count-type-across-archs.patch
preempt_count-is-int-remove-cast-and-dont-assign-to.patch
They are all quite simple and have not been the cause of any trouble in 
-mm, so we might as well get them merged.
