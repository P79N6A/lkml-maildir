Hi all,
from my point of view, the 'tainting-rule' for kernel-modules is too 
restrictive, allowing GPL-only modules to not be marked as tainting the 
kernel.
Would it be possible to let e.g. LPGL-licenced kernel-modules be loaded 
legally?
I do not at all want to hide my source code in any way, but under some 
circumstances, the pure GPL is too restrictive, and would reduce interest in 
open-source projects significantly.
Opinions?
Regards,
			Axel
