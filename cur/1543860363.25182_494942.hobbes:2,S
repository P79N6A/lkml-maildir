(I was only talking about the first issue/patch as being a regression, 
obviously, and forgot that there was more to the email I cited.)
Ah, okay. I somehow missed that all of the devices that were reported 
to break with the MSI change in mainline doesn't support MSI in mainline. 
Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if this issue applied to audio on ATI 
SB450 and later, which (I think) use the hda_intel driver, which supports 
MSI (although I guess it's still defaulting to disabled). If this is true, 
it would be a regression since 2.6.19.
The addition of a quirk to not use pci_intx with MSI on ATI PCI devices 
should be safe (until 2.6.20-rc1, this was the usual kernel behavior), but 
is clearly not critical if mainline doesn't use MSI with any such devices 
anyway.
