Right, I could have expressed it much better before, sorry.
Found the relevant code:
sd.c sd_open()
        if (!sdkp->openers++ && sdev->removable) {
                if (scsi_block_when_processing_errors(sdev))
                        scsi_set_medium_removal(sdev, SCSI_REMOVAL_PREVENT);
        }
And the obvious question would be whether the sdkp->openers++ thingy
could somehow be extended to enclose all hardware device users so that
e.g. sr.c wouldn't send ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL on a device already locked
by e.g. the sd.c driver.
Difficult question, though, since the group of drivers possible to use
with a certain device is not a static set:
it could be via
- sr.c
- sd.c
- IDE (in the case of ATA devices mapped via ide-scsi)
- ???
Is it possible to have such a per-*hardware*-device instance in the kernel
to keep track of various things such as number of device openers?
I'll do some investigation myself, too...
Thanks!
Andreas Mohr
