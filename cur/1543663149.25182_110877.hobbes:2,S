I agree, this bit has to be fixed.

True, but his change by itself is OK.  All of the places where
atm_dev_lock is acquired it is safe to do things like sleep.
While checking this I notice that atm_alloc_dev uses GFP_ATOMIC
thus unnecessarily.
Anyways, Matt, without a full time ATM maintainer and having basically
nobody who wants to take that on, we should take the small fixes when
they do occur and are correct as Chas's patch is.
