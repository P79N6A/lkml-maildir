Are there any rules for header files????
I have been trying to add a reference to irq_stat to be used just about
anywhere.  Problem is it is defined in a header file (hardirq.h) which
references other header files (hw_irq.h) which assume that other things
are already defined (FASTCALL) which, of course, are not defined. 
So.....
Are there any rules for header files????
You know, something like, if a header file references X which is defined
in header file Y it WILL include Y.
Could someone point me to where this is addressed, PLEASE?
George
