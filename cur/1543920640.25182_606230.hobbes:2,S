In the past enclosures supported only one kind of connector so this
assumption was fine. But nowadays an external disk may have several
connectors (like USB, Firewire and eSata). Why should the disk's name
depend on what type of cable did I manage to grab first? It is the
_same_ disk regardless of the cable type.
There is one thing however that could be improved: renaming a disk in an
udev rule should propagate the new name back to the kernel, just like
renaming an ethernet interface does. That way mapping error messages to
physical disk locations could be made much easier.
