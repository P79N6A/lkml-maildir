Awssome. The code was done in what seems like a hurry and mixes up a
bunch of things that should be seperate out into individual sub-sections.
The allocation of the waiter object on the thread's stack should undergo
some consideration of whether this should be move into a more permanent
store. I haven't looked at an implementation of turnstiles recently, but
I suspect that this is what it actually is and it would eliminate the
moving of waiters to the thread that's is actively running with the lock
path terminal mutex. It works, but it's sloppy stuff.

task_blocks_on_lock() is another place that one might consider seperating
out some bundled functionality into different places in the down()
implementation. I'll look at the preemption stuff next.
Just some ideas. Looks like a decent start.
