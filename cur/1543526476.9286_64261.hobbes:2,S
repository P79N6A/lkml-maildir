Subject: Hang during boot in 2.3.46 and 2.2.14 caused by ide_timer_expiry

Hello all,
	A while back, I reported this problem in the devel series kernel
(around 2.3.20 something); it still resides in the devel kernel (2.3.46)
and has migrated back to the "stable" kernel 2.2.14 but was not present
in 2.2.13.
	I have an ATAPI Zip disk as hdd in my machine and I rarely leave a disk
in the drive.  When booting the kernel, at the partition check stage,
the systems hangs when it tries to read the partition table with an
endless stream of "Lost interupt" messages.  The only way to get the
machine to boot is to either put a disk in the drive, or have the kernel
ignore that drive (hdd=noprobe).
	It appears that the problem is caused by the changes in
drivers/block/ide.c in the ide_timer_expiry function (this code changed
significantly between 2.2.13 and 2.2.14), but I don't know enough about
the IDE drivers to make an inteligent change.  Hopefully this is enough
information so that someone with more experience can actually fix the
problem.
	If anyone wants more information, please email me directly, although I
will be watching the list for fixes.
-Jeremy
