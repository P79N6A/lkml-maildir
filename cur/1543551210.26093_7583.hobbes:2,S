Hi,
After compiling the kernel three times, I can't get my SB live to work
under 2.4.0-test9. It doesn't want to work either as a module or
compiled in to the kernel. It's working fine under 2.2.17. 
All my programs seem to think that the driver is loaded and working fine
- I get the correct messages on startup
Oct 11 16:29:54 kinslayer kernel: Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver,
version 0.7, 16:18:49 Oct 11 2000
Oct 11 16:29:54 kinslayer kernel: emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 7 model 0x8027
found, IO at 0xd800-0xd81f, IRQ 11
However, there is no audio. Graphic equalisers work (although they're
out of time in 2.4 - always have been on my machine ) in Xmms though,
and the mp3 is actually being played...
Anyone had these problems?
Joel
P.S one other thing - how do I stop getting these messages in
/var/log/messages?
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
ide1 is an IDE DVD-ROM....
