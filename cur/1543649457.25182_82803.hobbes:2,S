Is possibly the code which defers the allocation of the per-cpu
memory until the secondary processors are being brought online.
I've decided to toss that.  It's causing some grief for architectures,
and only buys us 10k * (NR_CPUS - nr-cpus) worth of memory anyway.
Well.  It would be useful for NUMA to be able to place the per-cpu storage
into node-local memory.  But the code doesn't do that.  It just uses
kmalloc on the boot cpu, and we don't have an alloc_pages_for_another_cpu()
API..
