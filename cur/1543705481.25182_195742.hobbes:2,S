these instructions can be used in the idle=poll code instead of rep-nop. 
This way idle-wakeup can be done via the memory bus in essence, and the
idle threads wont waste CPU time. (right now idle=poll wastes lots of
cycles on HT boxes and is thus unusable.)
for lowprio tasks they are of little use, unless you modify gcc to
sprinkle mwait yields all around the 'lowprio code' - not very practical
i think.
