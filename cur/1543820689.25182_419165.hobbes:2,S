__do_page_cache_readahead() should use gang lookup.  We never got around to
that, mainly because nothing really demonstrated a need.
It's a problem that __do_page_cache_readahead() is being called at all -
with everything in pagecache we should be auto-turning-off readahead.  This
happens because splice is calling the low-level do_pagecache_readahead(). 
If you convert it to use page_cache_readahead(), that will all vanish if
readahead is working right.
