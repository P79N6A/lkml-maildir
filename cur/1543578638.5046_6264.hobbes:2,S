Let's decode it:

IRR for interrupt 19 is set, that means the IO APIC has sent the
interrupt to a cpu but not yet received the corresponding EOI.
That bit is read only, so we can't set it to 0 to kick the io apic.
The Vector is 99, we must check that bit in the ISR, TMR and IRR of both
cpus.
cpu1:

> TMR: only bit 0x99 is set

ISR is the in-server register, 0 means that the cpu is not processing an
interrupt right now.
TMR is the trigger mode registers, 1 means that the local apic should
send an EOI to the io apic when the cpu signals the EOI to the local
apic.
IRR is the list of pending interrupts:
0xef is the local timer interrupt,
0xfc is the reschedule interrupt
(see include/asm-i386/hw_irq.h)
These bits are also read only.
If you search the IO APIC documentation: number 29056601 - just search
with google. The local APIC is documented in the main cpu handbook (PPro
or later), in the chapter about multiple processor management
