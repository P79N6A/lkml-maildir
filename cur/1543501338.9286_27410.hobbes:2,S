I see a problem here that has not been addressed by either a
filesystem-level or non-filesystem-level solution.
In most circumstances you could divide non-albod-aware programs into two
classes:
1) Those that should get a single-stream representation of the albod
when
   they open it.
   Examples: cp, ftp, rcp, compress, tar
2) Those that should just get the default stream.
   Examples: vi, xv, cc, lpr  
However in a lot of cases it is not at all clear which of the above is
appropriate.
Examples: sum, cat, mail (attachments), grep
