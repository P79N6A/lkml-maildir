Hmm.. Time for some re-indoctrination?
We really shouldn't allow that. I know who to blame for udev, who else 
should I complain to?

That really isn't acceptable. Breaking user space - even things that are 
"close" to the kernel like udev scripts and alsa-lib, really is NOT a good 
idea.
We're much better off wasting a bit of time on backwards compatibility, 
than wasting a lot of user time and irritation (and indirectly, developer 
time) on linkages to packages outside the kernel.
If you cannot upgrade a kernel without ugrading some user package, that 
should be considered a real bug and a regression.
There are real technical reasons for not allowing those kinds of version 
linkages: it makes it MUCH harder to blame the right thing when things go 
wrong. 
Now, I'm not saying that we can always support everything that goes on in 
user space forever, but dammit, we can try damn hard.
(Somehow I'm not surprised about alsa. I think the whole alsa release 
process has always sucked. Dang).
