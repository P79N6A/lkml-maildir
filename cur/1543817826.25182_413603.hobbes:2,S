We have two similar bug reports to 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/184310,
 slab corruption in an object 
freed by release_mem:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/151111
 (i386)
	
https://bugzilla.novell.com/154601
 (x86_64)
So this bug seems to trigger on different architectures, and with different 
hardware.

I don't know about offset 0x6b8: 0x6b is POISON_FREE in mm/slab.c, so this is 
probably a misread. I think the correct offset is 0xbc. Bug 151111 has the 
corruption at the same offset. On x86_64, the offset is 0x124. This seems to 
be tty_struct->winsize in all cases, even though I can't tell for sure for 
most of the reports anymore.
So this could be a tty_struct locking bug -- it's surprising that we are also 
seeing filesystem corruption, but only in some cases. There was a recent 
locking fix in this area by Paul Fulghum <paulkf@microgate.com> from Feb 15 
which might be related, but the fix looks good to me: 
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6/?cs=623e3c38a511.

This didn't trigger anything in an overnight run. Any further ideas?
Thanks,
