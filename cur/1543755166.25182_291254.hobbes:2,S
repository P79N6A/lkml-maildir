For anybody who wants a good executive summary of RCU, see these:

Well, RCU is nice because as long as there are no processes attempting 
to
modify the data, the performance is as though there was no locking at 
all,
which is better than the cacheline-bouncing for rwlock read-acquires,
which must modify the rwlock data every time you acquire.  It's only 
when
you need to modify the data that readers or other writers must repeat
their calculations when they find out that the data's changed.  In the
case of a reader and a writer, the performance reduction is the same as 
a
cmpxchg and the reader redoing their calculations (if necessary).

With RCU the high priority task (unlikely to be preempted) gets to run 
all
the way through with its calculation, and any low priority tasks are the
ones that will probably need to redo their calculations.

Yeah, unfortunately it's harder to write good reliable RCU code than 
good
reliable rwlock code, because the semantics of RCU WRT memory access are
much more difficult, so more people write rwlock code that needs to be
cleaned up.  It's not like normal locking is easily comprehensible 
either.
