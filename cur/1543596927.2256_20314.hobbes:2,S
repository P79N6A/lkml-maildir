Most likely swap cache, that means it is the memory from your
simulations, just removed from the page tables and put in the
swap cache.

It'll get better as soon as we have the time, for 2.4.7
the VM statistics have already improved a bit so people
are no longer fooled by large "cached" figures ;)
Actual improvements to the code, if needed at all, will
come with time ... more than $0.02 will get you ;)
