Interesting, it handles more than just the file mode.  But does anybody really 
care about the ctime/atime/mtime in sysfs?  I can see how uid and gid could 
be useful.  My way of handling this (by copying out the potentially changed 
iattrs when the dentry is destroyed) looks more compact than Maneesh's 
solution, while not being any less effective, once I get it right that is.  
Does sysfs really need its own setattr?
A quibble: we normally use the term persistent to mean "saved on permanent 
storage".  Going by that, Maneesh just fixed a bug and did not make iattrs 
persistent.
Regards,
Daniel
