If thats the case then your "system" would have
the same problem that I'm encountering, since
polling results in buckets of packets being
dropped with heavy userland activity.
Since you can control exactly how many interrupts
are generated and how often, there should be no
advantage to polling,  unless LINUX interrupt
processing is badly broken, which seems like a
strong possibility.
This should work quite naturally without having
to use kludges like polling, enormous receive
rings or memory cheating.
