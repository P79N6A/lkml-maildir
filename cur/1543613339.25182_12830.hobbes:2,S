Well RAM is a hell of a lot cheaper than NVRAM. If you don't have
the required RAM on your box, the hardware engineers screwed up
and have to be "educated" preferably with an axe in the parking-lot.
The machine configuration should NOT have NVRAM addressed as a
bunch of RAM occupying a lot of address space. It should be
an easily-decodable chunk (0x1000, 0x2000, 0x4000, 0x8000, etc.)
that is paged, under software control. The base address should
be wherever memory-mapped hardware for your architecture usually
is.

You have to keep it from failing when it tries to update the access-time
of files/directories. This means that your read/only NVRAM/ROM must
either pretend that it can be written or the driver for the hardware
has to do the same.
