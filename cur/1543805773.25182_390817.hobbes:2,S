The mmc_block layer only tells the block layer what the driver told it.

I don't see what the problem is.  A sg entry is a list of struct page
pointers, an offset, and a size.  As such, it can't describe a transfer
which crosses a page because such a structure does not imply that one
struct page follows another struct page.
