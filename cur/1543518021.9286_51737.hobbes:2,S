I've built RPMS which do this. Goes something like...
%post
cd /usr/applicom/kernel
make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules
cp applicom.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc
Of course, you are depending on the kernel-source RPM then, which many people
don't install. Perhaps the top-level Makefile and Rules.make ought to be part
of the kernel-headers RPM instead.
