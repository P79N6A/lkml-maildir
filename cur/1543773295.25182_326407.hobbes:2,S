Doesn't seem very friendly.

I suppose it will display ęš (0x80 doesn't seem be a printable
iso-8859-2 character).  You told it to use iso-8859-2 in the first
place, so what do you expect?

ISO 8-bit encodings are more common with characters they can
represent.  These are a small minority of all characters commonly
used.

How is the kernel to know what to translate to/from?

FAT has a bad habit of constantly hammering the same sectors over and
over.  This can wear out cheap flash media in no time at all.
