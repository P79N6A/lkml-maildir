I can personally (and quite quickly) port the page size reductions to
other VM's, as the changes required are not particularly invasive.

I can correct style issues and the like for at least the bits I'm
responsible for  in very short order. I'll consolidate the waitqueue,
->virtual and ->zone removals within the hour, since that appears to
be wanted/needed.
Anton, do you want to take on mixing the zone into ->flags folding with
your approach?
