I think the problem is elsewhere. Users don't say: "My apps get paged
back in." They say: "My system is more responsive". They really don't
care *why* the reaction to a mouse click that takes three seconds with
a mainline kernel is instantaneous with -ck. Nasty big kernel meanies,
OTOH, want to understand *why* a patch helps in order to decide whether
it is really a good idea to merge it. So you've got a bunch of patches
(aka -ck) which visibly improve the overall responsiveness of a desktop
system, but apparently no one can conclusively explain why or how they
achieve that, and therefore they cannot be merged into mainline.
I don't have a solution to that dilemma either.
