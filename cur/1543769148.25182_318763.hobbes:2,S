Hi Jean
with module w83627hf  i found useful due  detection return -ENODEV
because I can see in commandline if it's some thing wrong. If it's not correct, there is a bug 
in the w83627hf and some other drivers.
int w83627hf_detect(struct i2c_adapter *adapter, int address,
                   int kind)
{
        int val;
        struct i2c_client *new_client;
        struct w83627hf_data *data;
        int err = 0;
        const char *client_name = "";
        if (!i2c_is_isa_adapter(adapter)) {
                err = -ENODEV;
                goto ERROR0;
        }
