Roman,
Lets apply your wallet issue.
Business who use the products to solve a pain of theirs do not give a
thought to the legality of the software inside the box.  The builders of
the box offer some legal comforts to their customers.
So the fact these companies exist and exploit GPL and steal from the OSC,
this is okay.  Social ideas to promote lawlessness and allowing violations
to continue unchallenged is why companies do it.
So lets cheer Roman for the wisdom of letting it all be free and everyone
can take from the pie and never give back.
Later,
Andre Hedrick
