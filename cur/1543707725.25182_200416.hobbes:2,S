I do like the robustness, due to the way the flag is associated with
dirfd.

Firstly, it doesn't scale better than dnotify in this scenario if
you're using signals and one-shot mode.  With one-shot mode, there's
also no overhead if there are only POSIX users.
Secondly, dnotify is synchronous if you _block_ the dnotify signal and
use sigtimedwait() to collect events.
I'd personally like to see the robustness problem solved with epoll
or something similar extended to queue more general events to
userspace, more reliably.
Hey!  That's an idea: Use select/poll on the dirfd to read this bit.
That gives you the flexibility to wait, or collect events from
multiple directories.  (Philosophicaly, every event should be
accessible through select/poll/epoll, right?).

That is _far_ too overcomplicated to do just for this one obscure bit
of information.
If you're going to do kernel-triggers-futex event transmission (like
CLONE_CLEARTID already does), it would be nice to have a framework for
more general event types, like pending-but-blocked signals, dnotify
events (individual ones, not all funnelled through one signal number
as they are now), fd-ready-to-read events and such.  The sort of
things that select/poll/epoll ought to be able to wait for, and in
most cases can.
