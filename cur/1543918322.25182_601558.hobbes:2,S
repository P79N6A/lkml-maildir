It's the process connector netlink notifier. It can report
fork/exit/exec/setuid events to userspace. See
drivers/connector/cn_proc.c

Correct, it's reactivated in a later patch in the series, but this
intermediate comment snuck through.

Probably plural.

"Locking Level", describing which locks *are* held, and which are
*not* held during a call. I thought it was a more generally
widely-used commenting convention, but I don't see any other uses of
it in the kernel. I can replace them with "holds cgroup_mutex" or
"doesn't hold cgroup_mutex" for clarity.

Yes, and since cgroup is short for "control group", "cont" still
seemed like a reasonable abbreviation. (And made the automatic
renaming much simpler).

I don't quite understand how this is meant to work - under what
circumstances would it occur? Are there cases when userspace is
required to try to reattach a task to its current cpuset in order to
get a cpu mask change to stick?
Other comments noted, thanks.
