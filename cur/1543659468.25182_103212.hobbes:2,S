Don't worry, it's pretty much a rule in Linux, IMO.  Synchronization
belongs _above_ simple data type primitives like strings or lists.
That's why answering your email was quick and easy ;-)
The Linux answer is "don't do that" :)

_Not_ doing things like this is a reason why Linux is so fast in certain
areas :)  Linus preaches over and over, "do what you need to do, and no
more."
But having said that -- see my mail to Rusty about storing the strlen()
result and then calling memcpy().  It [purposefully] does not address
the fact that the string may become stale data, because it's the job of
a higher level to ensure that.  But it does make explicit a compiler
temporary, and allows us to use the presumeably-faster memcpy().
Not that kstrdup() matters a whole lot, but anyway...
