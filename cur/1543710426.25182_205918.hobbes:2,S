Right now, in the infiniband-kernel package, the Mellanox driver is
under drivers/infiniband/hw/mellanox-hca, the 'upper layer protocols'
are under drivers/infiniband/ulp, and the 'access layer' is everything
else in drivers/infiniband.  I'm not sure it's worth rolling three
packages for that split right now.

I would say both.  Certainly the HCA driver code could have been
written much more cleanly.  However, it's not clear how the right way
to handle the memory management requirements of kernel bypass/RDMA
protocols, especially since the driver tries to support kernels all
the way back to the ancient 2.4.9 used by Red Hat AS 2.1 (which
doesn't even have get_user_pages()).
In any case, it's why I put the following items in the TODO list
of my announcement:
    * Use DMA mapping API so we work properly with non-coherent
      caches, IOMMUs etc. Add a function to get struct device * for an
      IB device so ULPs can call sync functions (embed struct device
      in struct ib_device?). (How do we handle systems with limited
      DMA mapping capacity?)
    * In Mellanox HCA driver, clean up mosal. Some obvious
      targets (there's lots more though):
          o Grunging through kernel code to find the mlock/munlock
            pointers especially has to go (mosal_mlock.c). We need to
            get VM experts from LKML to tell us how to handle memory
            translation and locking.
