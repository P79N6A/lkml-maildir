I noticed that the vga16 framebuffer driver returns a smem_len of
65535. Shouldn't that be 65536 ? (Realmode Segment A000-AFFF)
I already wrote about this to Ben Pfaff <pfaffen@msu.edu>, who is listed
at the top of this file, some time ago, to which he ansered
"I think you're right.". 
I recently looked at the source of a newer tree again to check wether he
did forward it, but appearently he did not. After looking at the
MAINTAINERS File again I found you being listed for "SVGA HANDLING",
so I'm sending this to you.
Should I forward this to Linus & linux-kernel ?
