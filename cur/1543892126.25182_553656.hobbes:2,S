Proposed semantics:
a) Process-global signals can be read by any thread (inside or outside
of the process receiving the signal).
Rationale:
	This should always work, so there's no reason to limit it.
b) Thread-specific signals can only be read by their target thread.
Rationale:
	This behavior is required by POSIX, and if an application is using
pthread_kill()/tkill()/tgkill()/etc. to specifically direct a signal, it
damn well better get to where the app wants it to go.
c) Synchronous signals ("Naturally" generated SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV,
SIGBUS, and SIGTRAP. Did I miss any?) are not delivered via signalfd()
at all. (And by "naturally" generated, I mean signals that would have
the SI_KERNEL flag set.)
Rationale: 
	These are a subset of thread-specific signals, so they can only be read
from a signalfd by their target thread.
However, there's no way for the target thread to get the signal because
it is either:
a) not blocked in a syscall waiting for signal delivery and thus further
execution beyond the instruction causing the signal is impossible
 OR
b) it is blocked in a syscall waiting for signal delivery and the error
is caused by the signal delivery mechanism itself (i.e. a bad pointer
passed to read/select/poll/epoll_wait/etc.) and thus the signal can't be
delivered
