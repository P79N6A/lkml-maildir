Can I get a Signed-off-by: on that?
It's not the right fix - the base of the problem is in swap.h, which
has this comment: 
	/* only sparc can not include linux/pagemap.h in this file
	 * so leave page_cache_release and release_pages undeclared... */
I poked around a bit for a sparc cross-toolchain, didn't find one, so
I couldn't see what exactly the problem was.
So, I'll take this fix.
