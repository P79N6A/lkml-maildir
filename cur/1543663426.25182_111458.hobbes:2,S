	I've finally succeeded to backport  AGP3 routines from 2.5. At least I hope I 
have. It is very Frankenstein looking but it can be compiled as module as it 
can be compiled into kernel.
	Any comments, directions are more than welcome, because I don't like how it 
looks like. You will see some stupid includes, but that was the only way that 
I could think of. 
	I am probably wrong, but I think that via-kt400.c in 2.5 is unnecessary, so 
I've excluded it from this backport, with some changes in via-agp.c. I did 
some tests, but most things are untested due to lack of hardware.
	GA-7VAXPUltra (KT400)	+ ATI Radeon R9000	= passed.
						+ GeForce 2MX400	= passed.
	Chaintech 7AJA2E (KT133)	+ ATI Radeon R9000	= passed.
						+ GeForce 2MX400	= passed.
	Abit (i810)				+ ATI Radeon R9000	= passed.
						+ GeForce 2MX400	= passed.
	Forgot to write down Abit MB model, sorry.
	On this ocassion i would like to ask anyone who aply this patch and something 
goes wrong to send me detailed feedback.
