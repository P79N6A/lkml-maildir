I know both good and bad people at corporations. The bad people were mean
and nasty before they joined the corporation, the corporation became a
vehicle for them to abuse others and directly translated to the
misbehaviour of that corporation. Doing bad things comes naturally to
them.
The good people went out of their way to prevent the corporation from
doing evil things, or left the corporation so they would not be party to
the unethical behaviour.
