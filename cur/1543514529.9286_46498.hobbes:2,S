This is due to changes in the rlimit struct which occurred in 2.3.24
(I'm 99% certain gnome-terminal worked for me under .23).  If you strace
the gnome-terminal or look at ulimit -a, you'll see that the cpu time
limit is being reported as -1.

The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and
tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will
have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy... neither its pipes nor
its theories will hold water.
