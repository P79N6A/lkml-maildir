Hi.

It's not the HAL that prevents MadWifi implementing USB support. Replacing
the binary-only HAL with OpenHAL and/or dissolving the HAL functionality
in the driver source does not get us any closer to a working support of
USB sticks.
Quoting Sam Leffler on that topic:

The Atheros-based USB devices work rather differently from the
cardbus/pci cards.  In particular there is no hal; instead there's an
onboard processor that runs the hal and implements a special protocol.
This means you can reuse some of madwifi but you also (probably) need to
redo the code some to break out different interfaces.  It's not a simple
project.

Which, at least for some sticks, requires a not freely distributable
binary firmware blob, by the way (see:
http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/cvs/2006-09/0233.html
 ).
Nevertheless, it would be nice to have that driver ported to Linux.
