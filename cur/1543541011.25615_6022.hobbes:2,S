There's a difference between being annoyed and being immature.  You seem to
have answered everything with maturity, so no offense taken.

Maybe not to someone who follows the list regularly, but for someone who
needs to get things accomplished, it's pretty bad.

I did a search on google.  The majority of posts I was able to find mentioned
a 2.2.15 patch which could be applied to 2.2.16 as long as several hunks were
hand-patched.  Personally, I don't particularly like hand-patching code.
Especially when the data that my job depends on is involved.

The howto on linux.org listed 
ftp://www.fi.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid
 
as the "official" location for the RAID patches.  The patches located there 
only went up to 2.2.11.  In fact, looking now, the linuxdoc.org howto lists
the same location.

I looked at them.  It appears as though the RAID patch changes the relevant
section to something totally different than it was before, so that the patch
can't be applied, even with an offset.  This is why I asked the question in
the first place.  In retrospect, I suppose it was a stupid question, but I'd 
rather be safe than sorry.

Thanks for the link.  However as mentioned above the howto there still gives
the incorrect location for current kernel patches.

I was hoping my post would serve as a reminder to those on the list who are in
charge of maintaining those resources.

My current prime objective is getting rid of the current kernel we are
running, as I am having other problems with the box that I think are kernel
related.  (EAGAIN errors -- resource temporarily unavailable when trying to 
make a TCP connection to a remote host after about 5 days of uptime)  A test 
box would be nice but it could take weeks to obtain one.  Personally, I'd
rather avoid having to go in at 2:30 in the morning again to reboot the box.

  That's question number 1 from the FAQ.

I looked at geocrawler, but I found their site to be really slow and their
search engine to be crap.  I didn't have the time or the patience to go
wading through messages one by one.
I'd be glad for a copy of the FAQ.  If you need web space to host it, let me
know.
