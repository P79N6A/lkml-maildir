   ah, ok. so there are cache issues even if if the user pte is not 
   established yet? Then it seems natural to couple flush_dcache_page
   with pte establishing, not at the driver level.
flush_dcache_page() or some architecture level equivalent belongs
whereever the kernel uses CPU store instructions to modify a page's
contents.
When IDE uses PIO to do a data transfer, the flush belongs there.
Right now this is occuring in the architecture defined IDE insw/outsw
macros.  It very well might be more efficient to do this at a higher
level where the total extent of the I/O is known.
