We're talking kernel virtual addresses, so the physical load address 
doesn't matter, of course.
So, take this kernel I have here as an explicit example:
$ nm -n vmlinux
[...]
c0431100 A __per_cpu_start
[...]
c0433800 D per_cpu__cpu_gdt_descr
c0433880 D per_cpu__cpu_tlbstate
And say that this CPU has its percpu data allocated at 0xc100000.
So, in this case the %gs base will be loaded with 0xc100000-0xc0431100 = 
0x4bccef00
The offset of per_cpu__cpu_gdt_descr is 0xc0433800, so 
%gs:per_cpu__cpu_gdt_descr will compute 0x4bccef00+0xc0433800 to get the 
final linear address.  Since 0xc0433800 is negative, this is actually a 
subtraction, and it therefore requires the segment to have a 4G limit.  
Which makes Xen sad.

__per_cpu_start is added to all per_cpu__* addresses.

No, but this is just as bad.
