Hi..
since i am using 2.2.10 kernel, my machine is crashing...
it crashs without noticing any error...
i tried to change RAM/CPU on machine, but it's still crashing...
i also tried to reinstall whole system... and to use another machine..
first time when it crashed was when i was switching from X-windows to text
console, so i thought that it's X server error...  but now it's crashing
on machine runned in single user mode... (average one crash per 2 weeks...)
