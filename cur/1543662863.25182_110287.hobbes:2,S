Hi Guys,
I apologize for my naive question. However, I think it's good way to ask 
my question to linux-kernel gurus here.
Basically, I want to add a system call which return the window size of 
the corresponding tcp connection. It should have a parameter of socket 
descriptor. (Say, get_winsize( int sock ) )
My question is which in-kernel data structure has the window size value 
of the ongoing tcp connection and how can I get that value from the 
socket descriptor. Actually, the question is related with the linkage of 
data structures from the socket to the tcp window size.
If you know any link or documentation, please let me know.
Thanks in advance.
