Why do you need this?  It adds a little more code, and changes
semantics a little bit, so I'd think it should have at least a
little bit of justfication.
+	if (!*buf) {
+		cpus_clear(trialcs.cpus_allowed);
Won't the above code fail if someone does:
	echo > /dev/cpuset/foobar/mems
Just guessing, but I'd expect buf[] to contain a newline char,
not just a zero length string, at this point.
