What kind of CF-IDE adapter are you using? This looks like a CF card 
which supports DMA in an adapter which doesn't hook up the DMA lines 
properly, therefore the DMA times out when the kernel tries to use it. 
You can use a "nodma" option on the kernel command line to disable DMA, 
I think..
I've seen some newer adapters that have jumper settings for "DMA" or 
"non-DMA" on them..
