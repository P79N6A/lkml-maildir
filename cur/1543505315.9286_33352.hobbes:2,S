No, that's not really true.  The BIOS is still necessary (like it or
not) -- it's the only way to access devices (disks, mainly) until actual
device drivers can be loaded.  It is not just a matter of information --
it's a matter of CODE.

I have considered that as well.  Unfortunately, it seems like just as
big a project.
