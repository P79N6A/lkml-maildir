No: in NFSv2, the server isn't allowed to cache write requests; more
precisely, the server is required to sync the data to disk before
replying to the RPC call. The client is quite free to cache as he
pleases.

Nope. NFS is not a POSIX-compliant file system due to the stateless
nature.

You will catch it upon the call to 'fsync()' or 'close()'.
