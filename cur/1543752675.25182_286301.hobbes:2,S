As it should be - I'd rather Linus was fixing these bugs than some of
the other stuff that comes out. The fix quality would go up markedly.

vendor-sec was never intended to be a kernel security list, it became
one by necessity. Its mostly actually talking about crap like gaim,
xpdf, gaim, gaim again. Its a contact point for any security problem
related to Linux and then normally works with the authors unless they
don't want to work with us.

Sometimes. Others like CERT have set disclosure dates across many
vendors already and aren't in the PR business so much as the "this is a
linux and windows and apple bug" business. Most of those cross platform
bugs are user space but far from all.

Then if the dates don't suit them they won't submit to vendor-sec and
we'll have to set up vendor-sec-two for them or build individual
relationships which are bound to mean the small vendors suffer. We can
push them, we can ask them to report to linux-security but we can't make
them jump.
