We'd happily use MSDOS if it provided all the services Linux provides...
Like being able to run Linux applications at the same time as the ring 0
stuff, for example.  Linux is much more than a mere protection mechanism.
Actually, we do have a specialist network & data processing application
that is far too slow when the network I/O is partitioned between kernel
and user space.  At the same time, we use Linux itself to provide a good
ddevelopment/management environment.
Hard to believe, I know, but even handling interrupts is _way_ too slow
(latency) - so we are building special hardware to modify user space
thread scheduling lists directly through bus mastering DMA.
My userdma driver is that, a device driver.  So it is not a general
kernel thing and security for normal users will not be compromised.
