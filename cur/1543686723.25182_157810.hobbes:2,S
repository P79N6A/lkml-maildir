Sure, but that only holds when you assume a specific mix of
independence and dependence among the bits.
(Bits within x are independent of each other, and also within y, while
at the same time x and y are dependent.)
In general, bits from x^y do not have more bias towards zero or one
than bits from x or y alone.  Consider an extreme:
   x = [ random_bit_0, random_bit_0 ]
   y = [ random_bit_1, ~random_bit_1 ]
Then:
   entropy(x) = entropy(y) = 1
   entropy(x^y)            = 2
This is no more arbitrary a mix of dependence and independence than
your assumption.
