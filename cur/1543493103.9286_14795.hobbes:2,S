Kernel panic: SCSI DMA pool memory leak 31 32
This happened in the same second that the "scsi : 0 hosts." syslog message
popped up. I have a BusLogic BT-958 SCSI card with all the SCSI stuff built
as modules. I was repeatedly loading and unloading sg and the rest of the
scsi stuff. Only the SCSI Tape Drive was being recognized on the buss (I
think the scanner needed to be reset).
