Subject: [PATCH] ppp_generic, kernel 2.4.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

An astute observer  pointed out that my patch had an extra closing */ in
it. I won't even attempt to explain how that happened, but believe me, I
am suitably mortified.  Can I get a mulligan?
Here is the correct patch, along with the original text.
This patch corrects a bug in CCP establishment which can result in a
major security hole.
The bug can cause PPP to NOT install and use a compressor  module for
sending,  even though the compressor is sucessfully negotiated by CCP.
Since encryption is sometimes implemented as a compressor module (e.g.
MPPE), this bug can cause PPP to send cleartext even though encryption
appears to be sucessfully negotiated.
The bug does not always show up--it depends on the order of CCP messages
exchanged during establishment, and therefore is not deterministic.
The specific problem is handling a sent or received CCP ConfReq. A sent
ConfReq should reset my decompressor; a received ConfReq should reset my
compressor. The original code had this logic exactly reversed.
I am not currently subscribed to the list so please respond directly.
