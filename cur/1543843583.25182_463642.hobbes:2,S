Yes, both latency from long running timer callbacks as well as
potential latency from a temporal grouping of timer callbacks
(those occuring on the same tick).
While I agree that root causes of the former should be addressed,
more latencies of this type can always easily creep in.  Timer
migration works as a long term preventative aid, not just a fix
for the problem of the moment.  And adding this needn't restrict
anyone from looking at the aforementioned root causes.
