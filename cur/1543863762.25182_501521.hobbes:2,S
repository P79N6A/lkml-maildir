Subject: 5 patches: updates to SPI and mmc_spi, kernel 2.6.19

(Please CC me on replies, I'm not subscribed to LKML.  Thanks.)
Five SPI-related patches follow.
1: bugfix for spi_bitbang: always call the setup_transfer
function via the overridable pointer.
2: Allow clocking SPI with chip-select inactive.
3: Define the bit-value transmitted for SPI transfers with no tx_buf.
4: Update of David B.'s (et al) kind-of-proof-of-concept
MMC <-> SPI glue driver mmc_spi posted on Aug 1, found at e.g.
<URL:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/linux/kernel/671939#671939>.
5: SPI cleanup should not have const on its argument.
All patches are based on 2.6.19 (sorry, not based on the new MMC
framework).
brgds, H-P
