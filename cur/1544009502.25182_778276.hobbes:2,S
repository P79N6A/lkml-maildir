[please cc me on reply, thank you]
I come from FreeBSD land and have a quick question.
Can anybody confirm if with Linux iTCO_wdt the watchdog can produce any
effect on DG33TL motherboard when its timer runs down?
With FreeBSD driver I get zero effect (after kill -9 for watchdogd
process), so I would like to find out if this is a driver issue or a
platform issue before diving into the code.
Thank you!
