If that lock were dropped, what would prevent other tasks from
touching the hardware while it's sending RESUME signaling down
the bus, and thereby mucking up the resume sequence?
That 20+ msec is a protocol timer.  Normally we'd want khubd
to handle such things, and then resume all the child devices,
but that's not so readily done for root hubs or during calls
from the pm core code.
