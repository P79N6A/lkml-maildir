Would any of you kind beings care to point me in the right directions
on what I would need to do to compile the kernel using kgcc. The
Makefile has HOSTCC=gcc and I thought I would have to change that to
= kgcc. If I am right is that the only place I need to change things?
All the documentation I have makes no mention. This is in relationdship
to 2.2.16. I know this isnt a major question, but my normal sources
have been rather quiet and well....useless.
TIA,
Henri
