Which kernel, what value of HZ? In either case, it's absurd to assume
that the kernel is going to provide you 1 microsecond resolution in
2.6 mainline, as the best HZ value is 1000 (1 millisecond). And we
don't busy-wait ever in nanosleep(). So the fastest your loop can run
is 1000 * 1 ms = 1 second. That's assuming the only time-consuming
thing is sleeping (minimal overhead). But, in sys_nanosleep(), we
convert nanoseconds to jiffies and add 1 if you requested any sleep
time. So,
HZ = 100
     1000 * (10 + 1 ms) = 11 s
HZ = 250
     1000 * (4 + 1 ms) = 5 s
HZ = 1000
     1000 * (1 + 1 ms) = 2 s (which is what Dick Johnson reported).
Note, that with HZ=250, there might be some extra rounding occurring
timespec_to_jiffies() that I've forgotten.
So 8 s may not be terribly unreasonable. I don't know, though, what's
add the 3 seconds if you're using 250.
Thanks,
Nish
