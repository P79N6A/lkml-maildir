Better to make things just work if we can.

Sounds OK to me.
Note that the code can be optimised:
	if (page_zone_id(page) != page_zone_id(buddy))
...
static inline int page_zone_id(struct page *page)
{
	return (page->flags >> ZONETABLE_PGSHIFT) & ZONETABLE_MASK;
}
We don't need to perform the shift to make that comparison.  If the
compiler's sufficiently smart it will be able to optimise that for us.
<checks>
        shrl    $30, %edx       #, <variable>.flags
        shrl    $30, %eax       #, <variable>.flags
        cmpl    %eax, %edx      # <variable>.flags, <variable>.flags
Nope, not smart enough.
