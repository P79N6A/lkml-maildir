Grrr. It's doable from userspace. Just echo appropriate number in
/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound in /sbin/init (or early in rc.S) and that's all.

You CAN disable it all with one small keystroke.

You can load all needed modules and then disable modules loading with the
same /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound ...

When you do not need GUI :-)

Exacttly. And for such protection you DO NOT NEED Andre's patch. You need
MUCH smaller and clearer Vojtech's patch (just two lines instead of 60K).

It's not dead idea. Even more: such protection ALREADY is offered by kernel.

No, this is not implemented (yet?). You can load all needed modules early in
boot process and then disable everything non-needed (including ability to
load modules).
