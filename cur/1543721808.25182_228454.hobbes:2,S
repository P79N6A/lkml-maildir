I don't think that any DMA lends itself very well to a generic
solution and I see that some have dedicated a lot of effort trying
to make such an API.
Take the simple PLX chip that is pretty common, at least as a clone
or macro-cell in many PCI/Bus devices. For its bus-master DMA, you
need a place to build a scatter-list in physical RAM with
a physical address that's known, plus you need kernel-mode virtual
address pointers to be able to build the list.  Then you need to
get the physical address of some user buffer and lock it down during
the transfer, or you need to have kernel buffers that you know the
physical address of, plus have kernel mode pointers to that area.
That area may not even be RAM! And, certainly the place that you
get the data from inside the device may be a single longword with
auto-incrementing hardware.
The fact that you write a 3 to some register somewhere to start
a DMA for a lot of chips, doesn't mean that there will
ever be a generic solution to DMA. Every driver is different.
Even the busmaster Ethernet boards fail to fully utilize the
capability of DMA. The idea of allocating a DMA-able block,
DMAing to it (waiting for the DMA to complete), then de-allocating
that block is extremely wasteful.
I think the whole thing should be re-thought. Something like:
On startup, some list of every page of RAM should be built
(once). A simple algorithm should be made that uses that
list. With a few machine instructions one should be able to
find:
(1)  The physical page of the starting location.
(2)  The amount of space available in that page.
(3)  The physical page of the next location.
(4)  Etc.
Using that information a scatter-list can be built for
the DMA transfer(s) and those pages need to be brought into
memory and locked down only for the duration of the DMA.
This would allow any resident page anywhere to be the source
or target of any DMA operation.
