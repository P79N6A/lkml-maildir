For the curious, here's a summary of some tests I did:
apic, 2 cpu's, no smp affinity -> network hangs under load
apic, maxcpus=1, no smp affinity -> network hangs under load
apic, 2 cpu's, smp affinity for all irq's on CPU1 -> network hangs under load
noapic, 2 cpu's, no smp affinity -> NO HANG, WORKSFORME
Quick and dirty conclusion: as soon as the apic comes in to play, things get
messy...
ps. load == 2 simultaneous nfs cp -rd <big_directory> sessions and streaming
esd audio over the network
Cheers//Frank
