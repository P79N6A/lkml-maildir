I was thinking of creating the new file kernel/cpumask.c. But it probably does not make sense 
just for the masks. I'm now thinking kernel/cpu.c is the best place for it. It contains all 
the cpu hotplug logic that deals with those maps at the very top it has stuff like
/* Serializes the updates to cpu_online_map, cpu_present_map */
static DEFINE_MUTEX(cpu_add_remove_lock);
So it seems to make sense to keep the maps in there.
