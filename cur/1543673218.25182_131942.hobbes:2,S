There are probably more such mistake. It should be easy for anyone
with sparc64 to kill them all at once.

Some architectures need special stuff (mtrr's), so I'd have to include
.c files, too (the other way). [Look at how the table of ioctls is
generated, its asm magic].

Are you asking why are there #includes in compat_ioctl.c? Its because
there is so many of them, and having to update all archs when you
tuoch fs/compat_ioctl.c would be bad.
