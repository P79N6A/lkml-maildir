The suggestion is to use UTS to implement CLOCK_REALTIME and
gettimeofday().
Since CLOCK_REALTIME has no specified accuracy bounds, it's a legal
realization, but UTS provides defined behavior when you have better time
sync than the 1s uncertainty inherent in the POSIX spec.
time() is more interesting, since it's so quantized already.  Is it better
to have a 2-second second, or to keep it in sync with gettimeofday()
and have 1000 1.001-second seconds?
