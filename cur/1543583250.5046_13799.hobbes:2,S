Greetings!  You are certainly right here, at least in part.  The ide
patches for 2.2 definitely impair tape operation on these boxes.
There was a crude workaround suggested on this list to use the
ide-scsi driver -- this basically worked, but gave *many* error
messages in the kernel log, and was significantly less reliable than
stock 2.2.18.  I'm still using ide-scsi out of inertia, but I suspect
that ide-tape might be just fine with stock 2.2.18 too.  And when I
saw some support for the ALI chipset, the decision was clear to drop
the latest ide stuff.
This has been the situation for some time.  Is this going to be
resolved soon?
