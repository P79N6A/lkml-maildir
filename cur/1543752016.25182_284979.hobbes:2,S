When it does'nt work, I see my 2 UHCI controllers and my EHCI
controller (driver=Hub)
When it does work, I see the same, plus:
T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 15 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=0ea0 ProdID=2168 Rev= 2.00
S:  Manufacturer=USB
S:  Product=Flash Disk
S:  SerialNumber=106C1141B1C3762C
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=200mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 3 Cls=08(stor.) Sub=06 Prot=50 Driver=usb-storage
E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 512 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 512 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=83(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   2 Ivl=125us
What fails is that I don't see anything related to USB mass storage in
logs, and so cannot access the device through de SCSI interface
(/dev/sda...)
Also I've just fount out that it seems that "echo y >
/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/old_scheme_first" makes it work!
