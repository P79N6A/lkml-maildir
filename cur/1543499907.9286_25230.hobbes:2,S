Seems to me that this proposal is a simplified, and less capable form, of my
previous proposal
for a "binder" extension. A binder being a file that contains an internal
directory of addressable
files (or objects). To reduce overhead, I proposed using two bits of file
flags to indicate that an
entry has not yet been checked as a potential binder; is definitely not a
binder so VFS can avoid
extra processing; and an entry is definitely a binder so VFS needs some
recursive processing
(originally I had two variations of this).
All system calls that operate on directories see a binder as a directory. All
system calls that
operate on files see a binder as a file. (I have a preliminary map of calls
around here and only
a minimum number of calls are ambiguous.) Any of the rare special
applications that need to
be aware of binder structure would have a user space library of special calls
(that are already
fully present in VFS). No existing applications are impacted at all -
including tar which
could easily use the binder as a file or its contents. (Content use by tar
would lose some
type information - see below).
Instead of a 'default' entry, I proposed the use of a file name map that
permitted all accesses
within a binder to be re-directed. This was intended to allow applications to
be placed in a
binder along with its resources.
The original message mentions Mac Forks. Mac files have a resource and a data
fork. Think of
a binder as a Mac style file with any number of forks! Each fork is named by
its internal directory
entry name. And we allow nested binders in binders just like any file system.
I originally suggested a two phased implementation with the first phase using
actual fs
directories to emulate a complete binder implementation. As I thought about
it further, this
is really not satisfactory as one goal was to have complete (mime-like) type
and format
information for each entry (object) in a binder. To store this additional
file stat information
nearly mandates that binders be implemented as VFS files with meta-object
handling added
for binders. Applications that need access to, or to manipulate, extended
type information
would need to use the user space library.
One approach, that I haven't studied in detail, would be to have a special
super block device
to handle binders. All opened binders would be associated with this special
super block
so that the 'device' routines are handled properly.
