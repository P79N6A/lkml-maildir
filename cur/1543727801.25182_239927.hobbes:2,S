That's basically what's happening, when the CPU does a write or a read of
some data from the buffer, it has to wait for that to go all the way across
the bus and to/from the card, meanwhile no other useful work can be done
while it is waiting. As Alan Cox mentioned, having a hyperthreaded CPU helps
tremendously in such cases, since the other "half" of the CPU can be doing
useful work while the first half is blocked.
