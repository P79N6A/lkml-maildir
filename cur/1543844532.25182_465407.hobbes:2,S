Looking at that bug though, most of the reporters are on AMD64 systems,
which uses amd64-agp, not via-agp. (We leave the chipset GART alone,
and just use the on-CPU one).
This..
agpgart: Found an AGP 3.0 compliant device at 0000:00:00.0.
agpgart: X tried to set rate=x12. Setting to AGP3 x8 mode.
agpgart: X requested AGPx8 but bridge not capable.
agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 0000:00:00.0 into 4x mode
agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 0000:01:00.0 into 4x mode
should be fixed in recent Xorg/kernels.  There is a v3 8x->4x
fallback failure that some people trigger, but that manifests itself
in other ways with different messages (where it tries to fall
back to 0x mode, and madness ensues), there's a fix for that
in Andrews -mm tree that should be going to Linus RSN.
Other than that, I'm unaware of any outstanding nasties in the
AGP drivers. I'm not really sure what to suggest for further
debugging.
