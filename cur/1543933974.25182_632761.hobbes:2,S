For ISA bus you want "at least" those timings. That is an easy case
anyway - ISA bus boxes, old processors and generally no TSC so we can
fall back to 0x80 - we know from 15 years experience the problem only
occurs with recent non ISA systems that have borked firmware.
Lots of ISA hardware does really need the delays and most of it will be
on old processors as well naturally enough.

Ok then the SCSI examples should be fine (although as I said I think they
are possibly bogus anyway)
