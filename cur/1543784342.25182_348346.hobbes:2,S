Frankly this should be done by someone who really understands the code, 
and considering the time it's likely to take it would probably be (a) 
someone with a desparate need, (b) someone rich or retired who doesn't 
work for a living and has the time, or (c) someone who works for a 
company which sells Linux distributions and therefore could get paid to 
do this. That lets me out on all counts, I would resent wasting the time 
to patch 8KSTACKS back in as a patch, but I could do that to make 
laptops useful. As Andi pointed out some architectures can't run 4k 
stacks, and at the memory sizes people typically use there would 
probably be a performance gain to do memory in 8k or larger blocks anyway.
I just see this as a large hassle for many laptop users and people with 
unconverted drivers, and no significant gain for most. 4k stacks work 
fine on most machines, but some people just can't use them.
