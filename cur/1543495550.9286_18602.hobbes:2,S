Since 2.2.7 I've been seeing some wierd FOO with /dev/pts/*.
I use screen, which requires +rwx permissions on /dev/pts/1,
or which ever terminal it is currently on... however, the group
permissions appear to now be set, by default, to _just_ +w.
Yes, I am in group tty....  I can fix the problem by manually
sudo chmod g+rwx /dev/pts/*
but it's annoying... does anyone know if this is a bug?  a
feature?  an automated workaround?  Thanks in advance.
