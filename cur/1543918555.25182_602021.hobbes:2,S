No, not really.  The setup code is not even part of the kernel binary 
proper, and may not even have been run under certain circumstances.
The "easy" solution is to link it in again, which seems to be what 
you're doing.  Now, currently the boot code is compiled after vmlinux is 
complete, so some of the build ordering would have to be changed and/or 
some of the code rearranged.
I suggest we tackle this *after* the x86 merge.
