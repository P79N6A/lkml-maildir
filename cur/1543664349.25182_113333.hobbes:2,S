OK I finally tried out the qlogic driver on the same 10 drives, actually
with scsi-misc-2.5 (2.5.63).
The qlogic is OK performance wise - as Mike pointed out, it sets a lower
queue depth; and even though it sets can_queue higher than the feral, the
qlogic driver software queues where in the same case the feral would give
us a host busy (i.e. queuecomand returns 1).

As Mike implies, the feral driver is setting can_queue too high, so in
addition to large queue depth affects, I am also hitting scsi host busy
code paths - yes, it is calling scsi_queue_insert. The host busy code is
not meant to be hit so often, and likely leads to lower performance.
So the feral driver needs lower can_queue (and/or queueing changes) and
lower queue_depth limits.

No, single disk IO performance is OK (with queue depth/TCQ 63 and
can_queue 744), so the too high can_queue with host busy's is probably
hurting performance than the high queue_depth.

No and no :(
I'm not sure if the disk arrays we have available have enough memory to
show such affects (I assume standard disk caches are not large enough to
have much of an affect).
