No, this is unacceptable. If a user removes a media in the process of
writing, then it's his fault, and his program should get thrashed to
give him a lesson.
I already attempted to make removable medium management in user space,
but several problems appeared, which can only be solved in kernel
space:
1. No device with removable media that I know of (CDROMs, IDE ZIPs and
LS120, floppies) can notice the driver of a medium removal/insertion -
you have to poll the drive for this. Thanks to Jens Axobe for removing
the doubts I had for AIN.
2. (apart from floppies) you *can* send a command to drives so that
they allow ejection when the uesr "presses the button", but you must
ensure that all writes are finished. This cannot be done in user
space. I already had the case where I allowed the medium to eject,
then wrote a file on the medium, then pressed the eject button: the
allow_eject command popped up in the middle of a write --> fs thrashed
3. detecting which processes use a device from user space is a
nightmare, as this requires parsing /proc/*/fd, stat() each symlink
and look at the st_rdev field. And even then, a process can write to
the file when you had just scanned its /proc/PID/fd.
4. mounting a device doesn't prevent its use as a raw device.
In short, a big mess.
The only secure way of doing this would therefore be in kernel space,
with the restriction that a device mounted with the hypothetical
MS_SLOPPYMOUNT option can be used either as a filesystem or as a raw
device, but not both at a time. But there is another problem: while on
heavy I/O duties, "the LED reflex" can no longer be valid: it would be
unreasonable to prioritiez the write on a braindead floppy drive while
a 150MB file needs to be flushed to disk.
