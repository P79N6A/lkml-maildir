FWIW, I've included a workaround for this (covering the getcwd(2) case
only, not other uses of d_path() by the kernel or modules) in 2.2.21-ow1
patch and it went into 2.2.22 release in September.
This kind of proves the need for double-checking newer kernel branches
(2.4.x and 2.5.x currently) for fixes going into what many consider
stable kernels.
