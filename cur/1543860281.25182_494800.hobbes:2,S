Well. when you see (something) = gpio_number + 5 ... you most likely
have an error. That means that they are close to integers, but not
quite. I'd use
typedef int gpio_t;
...it also serves as a nice documentation.

Great, except that mechanism should not #define them but "enum gpio {
} " them...

No, that's a wrong way. I want you to admit that gpio numbers are
opaque cookies noone should look at, and use (something like)
gpio_t... so that we can teach sparse to check them.

You may not want to clutter up code for one arch, but for some of them
maybe it is okay and welcome. Please do not document "silently
ignored" into API.

You are perverting what Linus said. "Do not bother detecting errors"
is not what he had in mind.. but perhaps it should be WARN() not
BUG().

I believe your text suggests it _is_ incompatible. Plus that seems to
mean that  architecture must not check for that error...
