We have an NFS server running RedHat 6.0 (running 2.2.5-22 UP) that
sometimes behaves really badly under heavy loads.  What happens is
that dmesg will show a bunch of lines like
    Sep 20 13:26:19 labserver kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:11/1329207 dir/1329180 not found!
    Sep 20 13:26:19 labserver kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 1329207
    Sep 20 13:26:19 labserver kernel: lookup_by_inode: ino 1329207 not found in obj
    Sep 20 13:26:19 labserver kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:11/1329207 dir/1329180 not found!
    Sep 20 13:26:34 labserver kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 1329208
    Sep 20 13:26:34 labserver kernel: lookup_by_inode: ino 1329208 not found in obj
and the nfsd processes will come to a complete halt.  In addition,
they can't be stopped - `kill -9' means nothing to them.  The
filesystem can't be unmounted, and after rebooting there are
invariably problems that fsck must repair.
This problem seems to crop up most often when several people are
compiling on the same remote filesystem.
Is this a known problem, and if so what's the solution?  For various
reasons upgrading to a non-RedHat kernel is a hard sell - possible,
but a struggle I'd rather not undertake without good reason to believe
that it will really help.  I've looked at upgrading knfsd, but the
latest stuff claims to need 2.2.7 or higher.
Thanks in advance,
       Dave
