Applied. It would be nice if there was a way to make the pair of ops into
one atomic op. Ah well

Not applied. You may be right, but this is too risky for 2.2.13

Not important enough. If it goes into 2.3.x when Linus is back and works out
fine then ok.

So not a candidate for 2.2.13  again maybe early 2.2.14

Not that important it seems. Maybe for 2.2.14
