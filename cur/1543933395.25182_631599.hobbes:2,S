Thanks for the report, sorry for the typos, I'll fix up my patch.

For the power architecture, no, I do not.  I used to, but my cross-build
box died and I haven't taken the time to set it all up again.  For i386
and x86-64 I do build everything, and as that's 99% of the users, it's
usually fine :)
I did start to try to get a s390 cross-build working, but ran out of
time a week or so ago...
