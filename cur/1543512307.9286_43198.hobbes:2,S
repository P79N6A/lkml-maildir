This is EXACTLY the point here: "why this wonderfull superpowerfull computer
need MORE actions from me then just plugging the device ? I ALREADY done all
what's need from me: I plugged brand new USB camera in port -- why I can not
use it without those stupid mknod ???"... Yes, not all users are like this and
it's not always desirable but there are MILLIONS of users like this anyway...

This EXACTLY since there are NOT devfs but hybrid scheme.

Your solutin to this problem is to create the same names by hand when device
is moved, of course ? With devfs you can do a symlink.

And then we need to reboot to get new devices attached :-) Exactly.

Just to keep /dev "Unix-like" :-)

 1. Few thousands files.
 2. You MUST issue mknod when attaching new device. It's problem for A LOT OF
    users. The ones who are sure that cores are inside of some fruits :-)

The price you named: "-r" and reboot when attaching new device. Not acceptable
for a lot of users.

And all are true. Unmodified driver will work with devfs, 10 extra lines
will add standard name for that driver when plugged and you can do quite a
few things with devfs not imaginable without it.

If driver writer will do it that way.

Of course capability can be handled in userspace. Hint: root also acts in
userspace.

There are enough vital programs in userspace anyway (init, for example :-)
If you can not trust them you should not use Linux at all.

I'm had problem with 16 partitions only limattion. And it's even before

What if there are NO admin ? So even 0.0001% is non-acceptable. Home computer
for my grandmother. I need two days to trawell to her and she can not use
mknod for sure.

It's make "compurter for grandmother" possible. Not alone, of course. But
it's needed ingridient.

Read devfs FAQ. It's described there in details.

No. It shows that someone even not read devfs FAQ before arguing against it.
