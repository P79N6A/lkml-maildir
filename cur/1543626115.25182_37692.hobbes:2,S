Bill,
You correct, I have tried this approach before and it seem like doubling 
the work on the system.  For one your create a thread which is really a 
process to create another process; that's ok for a small app but not a 
very scalable solution considering all the code in glibc used for 
pthread_create.   This is a bigger problem is when you only have one 
thread at nice value 0 and all other are higher value.  Now you have to 
have the main thread do it's work and the check flags to see if it needs 
to create the new thread so it can have a nice value you can change.
All this is really just pigeon dancing around the fact that Linux 
doesn't implement the PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS which is all I want .  I t 
would make Linux match Solaris and BSD model for POSIX threads.  I guess 
it wouldn't be POSIX if everyone implemented it the same set of 
supported features.  That's why I resorted to changing the nice value in 
hopes of have some say in how things get scheduled without all the 
superuser / capabilities hacks.
After all this info I will go back and try to find a work around. 
 Thanks Bill and Chris for the help.
