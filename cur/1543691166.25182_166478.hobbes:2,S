hi all
using an ICH5 SATA (raid?) controller with two non-raid drives. During
boot, it hangs after the following messages:
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ide2 at 0xc000-0xc007,0xc402 on irq 5
ide3 at 0xc800-0xc807,0xcc02 on irq 5
hde: attached ide-disk driver
that's a hard hang, and alt+sysrq won't let me do anything about it :(
any ideas?
roy
