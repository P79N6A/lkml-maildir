This is extremely similar to what XPMEM is providing.

We are tackling that by having our own page table hanging off the
structure representing our seg (thing created when we do the equiv of
your grant call).

Would the callouts Christoph proposed work for you if you maintained
your own page table and moved them after the callouts the mmu_notifiers
are using.
