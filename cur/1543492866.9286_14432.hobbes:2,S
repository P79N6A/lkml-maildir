It makes some sense. The problem is that soundcard chip costs about $10
and even cheap cpu's from AMD are about $40. You'll see the difference
when you compare the die size. However the advantage of software
implementation is that you can change your hardware on the fly. 
I think most manufacturers like the idea that they can cure a hardware bug
by simply issuing a patch.

VLIW - Very long instruction word.
Of chips I can remember are Merced, some HP processor, and that Elbrus 
stuff (from Russia). Also probably Transmeta is doing this.
