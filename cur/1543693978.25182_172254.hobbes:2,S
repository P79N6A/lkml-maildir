Sigh.  Using signals to communicate with kernel threads is evil.  It keeps
on breaking and each site does it differently and we've had plenty of bugs
due to this practice.
Signals are for userspace and the signal developers shouldn't have to worry
about weird in-kernel abuse and we have other simpler, more reliable
mechanisms available in-kernel and even more such ranting you get the
point.
Is there no way in which jffs2 can be weaned off this obnoxious habit?
