The one you propose (of parport_pc keeping track of the ports by itself)
is a different model, currently it's the highlevel that keeps track of
the ports and each lowlevel registers the lowlevel ports in the
highlevel list of ports. It doesn't mean the current model is wrong. You
may not like it and you may find it less efficient, or less clean, or
whatever, but the current model is definitely legitimate (the parport
code has the troubles you found in the sharing code locking, but this
registration model you're complaining about now is legitimate instead).
But let's ignore parport, the only question is if you know if other
modules are doing the same thing or not. Calling request_module from
cleanup_module was allowed with the 2.4 module API, now it deadlocks.
The only single reason I changed the module code is to avoid other
modules to deadlock in rmmod.
