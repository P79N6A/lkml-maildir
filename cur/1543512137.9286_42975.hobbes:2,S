Yes, that is serious.

Huh? It's not a sys_write(), it's generic_file_write(). Pipes do not come
even close to that place. And I'm talking about 2.3 - 2.2 is _way_ too
different.

Ditto. It's a separate issue.

Erm? Writer access is for truncate() and I don't see where the raw-io
comes into the picture.
