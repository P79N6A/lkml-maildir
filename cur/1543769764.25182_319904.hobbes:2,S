It looks correct:
decrease was added during 2.1 development: it's not in 2.0.40, it's in 
2.2.26: I think the idea was that operations with decrease can cause 
other threads to block, therefore a different wakeup strategy was used. 
The wakeup implementation was rewritten, but the loop remained unchanged.
I'll write a patch, thanks Patrick.
