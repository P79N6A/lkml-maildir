But that is exactly what I'm trying to account for: As we appear to all
agree, with CONFIG_REGPARM but too old a gcc (which is unknown at
configuration time and thus the user can't be prevented from turning
this option on), mismatches between assembly and C would result. Thus
the need for checking the gcc version in (some) assembly files (of
course this implies that for preprocessing assembly files one would not
try to use a different gcc than that used for compiling the C stuff).
I do, however, believe that it is an inherent weakness of gcc that it
doesn't decorate names of functions employing non-standard parameter
passing schemes in some way (i.e. similar to the __stdcall decoration on
Windows); with such functionality, it'd be much easier and safer to use
mixed schemes.
