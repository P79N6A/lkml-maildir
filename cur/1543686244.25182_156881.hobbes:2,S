Hello,
Thanks for pointing that out to me.  However, I don't think the kernel
strncpy implementation is exactly the same as that of Standard C lib
implementation.  Iwas just looking at it from the kernel code context. 
There's a point in doing it the "kernel" way, to save precious CPU
cycles from being wasted otherwise.
Regards,
Anthony Dominic Truong.
