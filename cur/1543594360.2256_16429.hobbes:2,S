Yes (I assume you mean the whole 'sockreg' register/unregister thread(s)...;-)
I never intended to get that patch in.  In fact I would be shocked (and a bit
horrified) if it was accepted.
But management doesn't listen to me when I say it will never get accepted so I
had to make a token effort of submitting it to prove it won't get accepted.
And I did try hard to convince them to release the actual driver but it didn't
work.
