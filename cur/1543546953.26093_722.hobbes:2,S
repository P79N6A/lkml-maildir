The "exec" is very easy. You don't need a real filesystem.
Your executable names can be a compiled-in table that maps
from string to function pointer.
The "fork" is easy with your choice of position-independent
code, real swapping, x86-style segments, or a real MMU.
You'd use whatever works fastest on the available hardware.
Don't have a COW.
