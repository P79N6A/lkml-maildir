Very cool, thanks!!
The one thing I always get hung up on is what args to use with the git
rebase -i command.  Say I want to edit 4a046d1 (which I do ;-), I see
it in my repo with git-log (3rd one down):
commit e46d517...
Merge: a4a0acf... 4a046d1...
Author: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    Merge branch 'master' of ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/travis/linux-2.6-cpus4096-for-ingo into cpus4096
commit a4a0acf...
Author: Suresh Siddha <suresh.b.siddha@intel.com>
    x86: fix broken flush_tlb_others_ipi()
commit 4a046d1...
Author: Yinghai Lu <yinghai@kernel.org>
    x86: arch_probe_nr_irqs
commit e65e49d...
Author: Mike Travis <travis@sgi.com>
    irq: update all arches for new irq_desc
So, upstream is tip/cpus4096 yes?  But then:
: git-rebase -i tip/cpus4096
Nothing to do
Attempting other args proved equally fruitless.
Thanks,
Mike
