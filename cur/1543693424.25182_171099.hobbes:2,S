That sounds reasonable to me (perhaps modulo the shmfs issue).  I intended
my patch not to omit any vmas that were dumped before, so I didn't consider
omitting any writable areas.  (I don't really understand the difference
between VM_MAYSHARE and VM_SHARED, so I might be assuming something wrong
when saying you are right.)

Actually the ideal would be "this mapping has been written to" (or might
have been, i.e. it at least was writable in a pte, if not actually dirty).
Then if you mmap some pages PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, and then mprotect them
PROT_READ before ever touching them, you don't dump those pages just as you
wouldn't dump always-read-only pages.  (If you had that, you could apply it
to anonymous mappings as well and omit all zero-fill pages.)  Ideally this
would dump PROT_NONE pages that have been written in the past as well,
which is ruled out by the VM_READ test at the top of maydump.  Despite the
comment, it looks to me like dump_write's use of get_user_pages will make
it work, so it could be a VM_MAYREAD check. 
Thanks,
Roland
