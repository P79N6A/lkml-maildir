Why not use HDLC frames? That addds 2 bytes to the header, but would
be consistent with other protos:
RFC 1662, 3.1.  Frame Format
   A summary of the PPP HDLC-like frame structure is shown below.  This
   figure does not include bits inserted for synchronization (such as
   start and stop bits for asynchronous links), nor any bits or octets
   inserted for transparency.  The fields are transmitted from left to
   right.

           |   FCS    |   Flag   | Inter-frame Fill
           |16/32 bits| 01111110 | or next Address
           +----------+----------+-----------------
Of course it wouln't include flags (0x7E) nor FCS, as they are usually
done in hardware/firmware.
