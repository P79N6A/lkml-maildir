Yes, I meant it killed extended config space. Note that we are
about to send out code that enables PCI Express error handling,
so this will become more visible now.

Yes, I saw this in 3 out of 4 systems I checked. I'll go check
some more systems too.

The MMCFG resources are not listed at all in the BIOS provided
memory map.

Oh I agree with you that booting is more important. My point with
the spec statement was that most BIOS developers may not even know
they are doing something "wrong" by not listing these resources in
the int15 E820 table, since the document they normally refer to
doesn't say so. I suspect there are many more systems out there
which do the same thing and will fail the check, but we never notice
since most users don't try to ever access the extended space today.
