Yes, by asking immediately
  Is this issue still present with $latest_upstream_version?
If you don't do this for Ion then that's your fault.

Let's check your statement against reality:

Open source development does not work by whining and trying to spread 
your opinion through fake "polls" - either you implement what you want
yourself or it won't happen.
That's the simple truth, and it's your time that you waste when you 
continue to complain. It also took me a few years until I learned this 
lesson.
But an important observation is that when you start something other 
people consider worthwhile there will be other people who participate in 
what you do, or who even continue it when you decide to switch to other 
projects instead.
