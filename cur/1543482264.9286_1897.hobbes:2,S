    If you're talking kernel security, I'll have to ask you to detail
    these security problems.  If you're talking _application_ security,
    that's not a problem of the kernel (and can be dealt with by the
    simple expedient of spending a few man years writing your own
    userland.)
    If legacy userland security is the BIG ISSUE that makes Linux
    obsolete, Linux is not obsolete.
