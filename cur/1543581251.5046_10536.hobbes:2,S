OK, talked with someone who knows a little more about this than i do.
According to him, one reason I may be getting these errors is due to the
fact that the HPT370 controller is using IRQ18 which falls in the APIC
extended IRQ range (16 - 31).
If this is a problem is there a work-around? I don't know how to change
the IRQ the HPT370 is using since it's an onboard card.
