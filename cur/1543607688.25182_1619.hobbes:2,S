Subject: VM test on 2.4.14-pre3aa1 (compared to 2.4.14-pre3)

Summary:  2.4.14-pre3aa1 takes more wall time for
	tests.  Audio sounds closer to the "edge",
	I.E more likely to skitter or skip.
Test:	Run "mtest01 -w 80" and mmap001 from LTP.
	Listen to long mp3 sampled at 128k.
	Light console irc client and lynx use.
2.4.14-pre3aa1
About 2-3 seconds of sound skitter when typing
a URL in lynx or something in irc client.
