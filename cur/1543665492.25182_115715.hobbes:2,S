Greg's tools still have unsolved security holes in them. We still have
unsolved persistence of permissions and reuse problems. I think they are
soluble. The current insoluble dirty great security hole we have is
lack of vhangup for non tty devices (ie BSD revoke). Right now that
allows some quite nasty things to occur if you ever had console access.

For certain kinds of device yes.

Static naming/permissions management is current simply the best of
available evils for many things. With stuff like modem arrays on serial
ports its also neccessary to know what goes where. I'm all for moving to
setups when possible where things like SCSI volumes carry a volume name
and permission/acl data in the label
