I really must work harder to get rid of that perception. It used to be the 
case, but isn't nowadays. Just about all of suspend2's changes are new files 
in kernel/power and include/<arch>/suspend2.h. The remainder are misc fixes, 
and enhancements like Christoph's todo list.

It was hardly touched for a long time, but that has certainly been changing in 
the last few months. I wasn't meaning to be uncharitable. Sorry for giving 
that impression.

I'm more concerned about the security implications. I'll freely admit that I 
haven't spent any real time looking at your code, but I'm concerned that the 
additional functionality made available could be used by viruses and the 
like. I'm sure you'd have to be root to do anything, but how could the 
interfaces be misused?

I didn't realise I was holding one :). I'm not sure that I agree that there's 
a need for both, but I have no desire whatsoever to act an any sort of nasty 
way. All I want is to help provide Linux users with stable, reliable, 
flexible and fast suspend-to-disk functionality.
Regards,
Nigel
