I was a little mistaken about this.  The BAR that causes the problem is
not I/O.  It *is* memory.
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. G400/G450 (rev
03) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: Matrox Graphics, Inc. Millennium G400 16Mb SGRAM
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 11
        Memory at cc000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]
        Memory at cfefc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Memory at cf000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8M]
        Expansion ROM at cfee0000 [disabled] [size=64K]
When I open and mmap resource0 (the framebuffer) I get 0x2b9aa48ea000.
When I open and mmap resource1 (the card's registers) I get
0x2b9aa68ea000.  I can access the resource0 pointer all day long without
problems.  The firs access to the resource1 pointer results in a segfault.
