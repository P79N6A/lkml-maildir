well to add mISDN to the kernel tree is straight forward
./std2kern
and the out of tree set becomes in tree a bit of git magic and you have 
a patch.
im advocating it for now alongside isdn4linux prehaps marked as 
"EXPERIMENTAL" im not involved in the mISDN team im a contributor/hacker.
need the buy in from Cristian R/Karsten K.
FYI here in south africa ISDN BRI is widely available with the high 
costs of ISDN PRI this is the best/most practical solution for VOIP.with 
ADSL only now becoming availble on mass the "fastest" connection is 
still 64/128k ISDN in many areas.the hardware is easily available from 
all outlets.my device of choice is a cheap USB modem that comes in @ 30$ 
US per port (can use upto 8) the 4 port digium card comes in @ 650$.
