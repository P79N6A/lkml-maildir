The choice of need_preempt() and preempt() came out of discussion with a
number of people. However, I can see the points being made. I have to admit,
I've not come across conditional_schedule in the main kernel, so I guess this
is an Andrea specific.
I think, actually, I prefer yield/need_yield or maybe yield and
yield_requested as this is consistent with things like sched_yield.
