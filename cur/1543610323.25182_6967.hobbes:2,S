That's a nice idea but I wouldn't rely on the fact that the third
and the fourth byte of a file are sufficient to identify the type.
If you look at the magic numbers in /etc/magic, you'll find:
  0x00640107      Linux/i386 impure executable (OMAGIC)
  0x00640108      Linux/i386 pure executable (NMAGIC)
  0x0064010b      Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (ZMAGIC)
  0x006400cc      Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (QMAGIC)
  =0514           80386 COFF executable
It's standard to count on the first (and eventually following) bytes.
And if you look further on in /etc/magic, you'll see that there are
other file types having 0x0064 as 3rd and 4th byte.
I think it would not be a great deal to revert the changes in fs/exec.c
Thanks for your attention
