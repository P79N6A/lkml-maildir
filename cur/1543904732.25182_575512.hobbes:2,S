Subject: [PATCH] various doc/kernel-parameters fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

- tell what APIC (by request), MTD, & PARIDE mean
- correct some source file names
- remove IA64 "llsc*=" (seems to have been removed from source tree)
- removel SCSI "53c7xx=" (driver already removed)
