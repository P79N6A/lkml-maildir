how hard did you push it in testing?
in some configurations i've had to subject it to many hours of
intensive IO (ie multiple concurrent and continious bonnie++ runs of
varying file sizes) in order to get it to spin in
qla2x00_intr_handler. but it will eventually hang given enough IO ime.  
(in other configurations, heavy sustained IO will lock it up in
minutes, even seconds).
