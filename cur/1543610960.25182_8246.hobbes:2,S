hi,
a short mail to report a small bug in "ov511.c".
(drivers/usb/ov511.c)
the line defining the kernel version is missing in the kernel 2.2.20.
I downloaded it 2 days ago.
************line  missing**************
static char kernel_version[] = UTS_RELEASE;
************end of line missing********
I am at work, so I have only the 2.2.19 kernel, so I cannot say
the right line, but it's just under the "MODULE_DESCRIPTION" line.
Hope this help,
Eric
