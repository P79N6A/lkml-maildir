A shot in the dark; try enabling IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE in your kernel -  
the help text for that option : 
config IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE
        bool "Use multi-mode by default"
        help
          If you get this error, try to say Y here:
          hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
          hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
          If in doubt, say N.
Not the *exact* error you are getting, and I admit I don't know exactely 
what changes this option mkes, but the error seems similar enough to what 
that help text describes that personally I would give it a shot and see 
if it changes anything.
