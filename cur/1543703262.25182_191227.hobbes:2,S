The "Update" section describes the setup which - after *weeks* of
frustrating trail-and-error - managed to get things going.
Notice the unusual BIOS setting (Enhanced Mode - SATA only) which did
the trick and enabled PATA *and* SATA.
You may want to try that if you haven't already.
The ideN=noprobe my indeed not be necessary . It was recommended by Jeff
Garzik to me at some time IIRC. Kernel 2.6 does *not* need the noprobe
stuff AFAICT.
FWIW my P4P800 Deluxe is working flawlessly with 4 P-ATA devices (2 HDs,
a ZIP100 and a 48x Burner) and one SATA 160Gb HD.
I'm using 2.4.22-bk36 with matching libata patch so i'd think that any
kernel 2.4.23+ will do the trick.
HTH and GL
