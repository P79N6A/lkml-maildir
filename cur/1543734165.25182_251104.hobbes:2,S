The key piece I had missed is that it only checks elf files (I now see
read_elf_header).  So, the test may even be superfluous.  But try it,
see what breaks, then send fixes upstream ;-)  BTW, the read_elf_header
returns NULL on error, but IS_ERR is used against the returned pointer
(so errors will oops).  Also, the security_set_operations +
set_digsig_ops looks like it should be replaced with static structure
member assignment.  The digsig_sem can be statically setup with
DECLARE_MUTEX().  digsig.c::secondary should be static.
digsig.c::digsig_num_cached_sigs should be static and declared in
digsig_cache.c.  I'll keep digging.
thanks,
