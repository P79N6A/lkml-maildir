Hi,
I think basic assumption between us and you is not match..
Our assumption, the live patching is not for debug, but for the real 
operation method to fix very very important process which can not stop.
Live patchin fix the important process's bug without disrupting process.

Yes, so they provide us the patch module, and we want to apply the patch 
as live patching.

???
To takeover the application status, connection type 
communications(SOCK_STREAM) are need to be disconnected by close().
Same network port is not allowed to bind by multiple processes....
How can you do that??
Users don't want to disconnect,(and also we don't want to disconnect) 
but server process need to it to takeover the status.

For example,
current process's resouces of rlimit.
you nerver set current rusage to new process.
especialy, ru_utime and ru_stime is very important to critical applications.
I don't know much about resources, but there may be more....(I hope not..)
