I downloaded the full test12 and have lockups after using X (upstream
version 4.0.1Z) 15-45 mins.  For me, SysRq+u works, but if I then
press SysRq+b, nothing happens.  There are no signs in the syslog.
I'm using the latest Debian packages from the Woody release on an
Mobile Pentium II, 333 MHz, 160 Mb ram.
