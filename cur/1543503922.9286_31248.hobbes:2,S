What you would have to do is something like
1. Linux process mlocks, and then calls rtl_register_task(function pointer)
event (e.g. timer irq)
rtl_irq handler
   call rtl_scheduler
        find rtl task to run
        rtl task does switch to user mode at addr -- into linux process
The whole point is to avoid a Linux process switch -- and the attendent delays
So current points to the current linux process, but that may be waiting for 
 the realtime process.

I  suspect it was the extra glop on the kernel: but Californians are a mystery to 
me.  I'm not so thrilled with the idea either.
