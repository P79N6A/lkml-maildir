These patches add:
* at data structures level:
- one cputime64_t (8 bytes) per cpu
- two cputime_t (2 * 4 bytes) per signal_struct and one cputime_t per task_struct
* at processing level:
- display and convert one more value in show_stat() (fs/proc/proc_misc.c)
- display and convert two more values in do_task_stat() (fs/proc/array.c)
- manage (copy and add) one more value in __exit_signal() (kernel/exit.c)
- initialize three more fields in copy_signal (kernel/fork.c)
- add a bit test in account_system_time() and if the bit is set call a new
function (46 bytes on x86_64).
Size of stripped kernel before (on x86_64):
vmlinux 7305064 bytes (not stripped 52643888 bytes)
Size of stripped kernel after:
vmlinux 7305064 bytes (not stripped 52677180 bytes)
means 0 bytes added ????
