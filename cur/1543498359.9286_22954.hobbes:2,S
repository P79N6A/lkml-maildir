  Does Squid support it for its clients by itself, does it expect to
be supported by a server, or both? And if it supports this by itself, what
will it do in the case of DoS attack (send ahort request to something
slow-answering, then huge number of requests for something else in the
attempt to grow Squid in memory)?

  Yes, but even if they are, they can be sent before previous request is
answered, so they can't be passed to userspace yet if the whole thing
should remain "transparent". Unless the responses are blocked
(causing major headache in another place -- with multiple requests,
received over the same connection, all sent to different "new" file
descriptors, so multiple processes will start answering, block on writing
and then kernel serializes them back in the order of requests).
