Well that was moderately stupid.  Thanks.  It doesn't seem to cause
problems in practice though.  Maybe in the longer term...
I believe the tcp_minisucks.c code needs redoing irrespective
of latency stuff.  It can spend several hundred milliseconds
in a timer handler, which is rather unsociable.
There are a number of moderately complex ways of smoothing out
its behaviour, but I'm inclined to just punt the whole thing
up to process context via schedule_task().
We'll see...
