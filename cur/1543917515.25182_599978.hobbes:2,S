Logic tells me that an unused static variable should never go into the
.o. If something tries to take its address, it's no longer unused.

Yeah, that's exactly what my e-mail was about. The macros
KPRINT_SUBSYSTEM and KPRINT_DRIVER are not defined on the command
line, but in each source file that wants this prefix, after the
variables with the same names have been declared in kprint.h. This is
intentional; they can be overridden with a define, otherwise, they'll
default to static-const string variables.
