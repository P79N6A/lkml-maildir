-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Michael-Luke Jones <mlj28@cam.ac.uk>
This patch is identical to that introduced in
1a1276e7b6cba549553285f74e87f702bfff6fac to the Linus' 2.6 development tree 
by Alan Cox.
'This is based on the proposed patches flying around but also checks that
the device in question is new enough to have word 93 rather thanb blindly
assuming word 93 == 0 means SATA (see ATA-5, ATA-7)' -- Alan Cox
Required for my SATA drive on an Asus Pundit-R to operate above 33MBps.
