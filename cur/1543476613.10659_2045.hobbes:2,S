I find the idea interesting and useful.
The below is the output I got :
bash-2.02# sh scripts/ver_linux
-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or looks
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)

(1) This may not be the expected one. I have net-tools 1.49-1 installed.
(2) The field is empty as I have a replacement package (console-tools by
    Yann Dirson, dirson@debian.org) installed.
