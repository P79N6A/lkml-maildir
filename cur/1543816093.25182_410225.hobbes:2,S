I actually have your code already, I picked it up on directfb-dev
quite a while back :-)
The i810 i2c code is nearly exactly the same as intelfb, they use the
same scheme, i9xx also support GMBUS, which means the chipset takes
over the bitbanging, you just give it a byte count and register... but
I'm not having the greatest luck reverse engineering it, hopefully
Intel will tell us how it might work at some point..
Im trying to figure out the architecture for moving a lot of stuff
into userspace, but keeping enough in kernel for people to do what
works now..
Dave.
