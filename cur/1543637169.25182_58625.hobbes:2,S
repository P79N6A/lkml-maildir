But as it is today, all blocked locks get inserted at the end of the
list because time_before_eq does a signed comparison! With the unpatched
code, when you have a blocked lock, and the conflicting lock is removed,
lockd will never send out a GRANTED_MSG. Because the blocked lock is at the
end of the list, and never picked up.
That's the real reason for changing NLM_NEVER to the largest _signed_
quantity. And if you do that, you need to deal with jiffy wraparound.
Maybe the way I did it is not optiomal, I concede. But you can't leave
it at ~0UL.

As you can see from the patch, it's not really much you need to add.
The functionality is all there, one only needs to decode the GRANTED_RES
call rather than dropping it.
