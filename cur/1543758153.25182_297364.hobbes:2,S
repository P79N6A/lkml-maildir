(I hope trackpoint is the correct word. It is a small "joy"stick like
 pointer located between the keys of the keyboard on many laptops)
As of 2.6.11-rc4 the trackpoint on my Dell Latitude d800 no longer
works. 
The d800 is equiped with both a trackpoint and a touchpad and up to 2.6.11-rc3 
both worked fine with the kernel ps2 driver.
The touchpad still works in 2.6.11-rc4 and rc5 but the trackpoint does
nothing.
dmesg gives me the following in both rc3 and rc4.
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
ALPS Touchpad (Dualpoint) detected
input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
