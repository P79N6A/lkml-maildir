I'll send you a detailed list after the patch bomb.

Done now (adding ccs) 
x86_64-sparsemem_vmemmap-2m-page-size-support.patch
x86_64-sparsemem_vmemmap-vmemmap-x86_64-convert-to-new-helper-based-initialisation.patch          
Look like these two should be merged together
Also I'm concerned about a third variant of memmappery. Can we agree
to only merge that when the old sparsemem support is removed from x86-64? 
Otherwise it looks good to me.

But a node is just defined by its memory?

That would be ugly and a little error prone (would this case really be 
tested in user space normally?) but might work.

Yes for now please.
e.g. we at least need a patch to actually check the version number
of the boot protocol.
