ntfsresize, ntfsclone and others have the same problem due to this kernel
limitation.

I'm afraid unrelated. There are two main issues two consider if you want
to fix this:
 1) You must know the exact, _real_ partition size.
 2) You must be able to access it.
Firstly, I don't think EDD tells anything about the partitions but maybe
I'm wrong, I didn't have time to check it out.
Secondly the kernel doesn't always allow access to the last sector via the
partition (longstanding kernel bug). We could access it via the full
device (e.g. /dev/hda, etc) but that's quite messy, error-prone and this
should be fixed in the _kernel_.
Other people are also disturbed by this for a long time,
 - they can't make a full partition backup (dd)
 - just like NTFS, the new partitioning format, GPT, also stores
   backup data in the last sectors. 
There were attempts to fix this in 2.6 but I don't know if it was
completed. Maybe somebody knows or have the time to investigate it?
