Are you sure this can work? Initially, I thought I could use the
attribute list to only uncompress the extend that has the VCN I'm
interested in.
That would not work: NT would split individual runs across extends
(i.e. split them in the middle). Did I misunderstand, or do you have a
solution for that as well.

Martin
