Well it looks like Neil is on vacation or is hiding from us or something.
In which case our options would be to go ahead and merge your #3 with
our fingers crossed, or wait and do it in 2.6.23.1 or .2.
How serious is this bug which you're fixing?  Will it affect users
of "legacy" MD setups, or only those who have enabled fancy dma-engine
features?
Either way, we need to get #2 (at least) in to Linus.
