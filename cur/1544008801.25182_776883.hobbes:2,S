We could also accept the NULL but warn when doing so, perhaps also
adding a dummy device from the regulator core for the logging.  That'd
provide some pushback on cpufreq to move to the device model if nobody
is able to convert it right now.
On the bright side, looking at the situation with the clock API there
don't seem to be any other substantial offenders here.  Most of the
other users are part of the platform code and get to peer inside the
clocking structure, so if cpufreq were fixed there shouldn't be much
problem here.
