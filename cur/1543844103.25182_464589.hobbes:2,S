If the decision you're talking about is whether all markers in the
system should behave one way or another, then this is a degree of
central control that we have not contemplated during the entire
thread, until now.
It is an end-user such as an administrator who will figure out which
probes/markers/tracing elements need what kind of processing attached.
They don't want to recompile the kernel to switch.  They will want
different types of processing, or none at all, for different markers
during a system lifetime.

This line of thinking makes me worry that we've forgotten all that we
learned during the weekend.  Amongst the insights apparently agreed
was that on *any given system*, a mixture of static an dynamic probing
was likely necessary.  For the static part of the instrumentation, a
marker that could be hooked up to either type of probing system was
desirable, which implies some sort of run-time changeability.
(Regarding module loading being considered a blocker for a tool like
systemtap, don't.  We will support pre-compiled boot-time
instrumentation loaded from e.g. initrd or linked right into vmlinux.)

That's if it works, if it can be implemented, if it does not create
conflicts between multiple tracing/probing systems, if ...  
Yes, in theory it might bridge the gulf between compile-time and
run-time configuration, but aren't these all big "if"s right now?

I don't understand how this new compile-time configured style of
marker is to serve anyone who wants to use something other than a
single distribution-picked tracing/probing tool.  I though we had
abandoned that model some time ago.
