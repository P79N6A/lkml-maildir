OHGAWD I GOT IT!!!!!!!!
I admit, totally coincidentially but its really FIXED. Today I went to the puter scanning the 
servers by routine and wondered why the bandwidth is at 100% without any holes.
The only thing I have done is I switched off hyper-threading because the server is at only 20% CPU 
anyway so I just disabled it.
So its something with linux dealing with hyper-threading. YAY :)
