This patch looks fine w.r.t. alignment but given the below seems called
at runtime (not just at mount time) for performance and to save a dozen of bytes
of kernel stack it would probably better to use the nfs_fh structure in
2.2.19pre7 for the in-kernel representation and to define a new structure for
userspace message passing (defined as the nfs_fh in 2.2.19pre6). But at least
now we see _why_ it broke ;)
