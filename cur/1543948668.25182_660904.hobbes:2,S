Before this patchset gets too far, I'd like to decide on whether to
adapt my suggestion to call that per-cpuset flag 'cpus_system' (or
anything else with 'cpu' in it, perhaps 'system_cpus' would be more
idiomatic), rather than the tad too generic 'system'.
People doing 'ls /dev/cpuset' should be able to half-way guess
what things do, just from their name.
