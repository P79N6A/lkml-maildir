Hello!
> Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008
F.e. look at lines 544-545 of klips/net/ipsec/pfkey_v2.c.
Probably, it will help. If it will not, search for another bug
of the same kind.
Well, and I assure you, it will not work until you will not clean this file
of innumerous ifdefs.
