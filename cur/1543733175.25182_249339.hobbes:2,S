They have to be merged. Cards with two heads need the mode set on each
head. fbdev only sets the mode on one head. If I teach fbdev how to
set the mode of the other head fbdev needs to learn about memory
management.  The DRM memory management code is complex and is a big
chunk of the driver.
I would also like to fix things so that we can have two logged in
users, one on each head. This isn't going to work if one them uses
fbdev and keeps swithing the chip to 2D mode while the other user is
in 3D mode. The chip needs to stay in 3D mode with the CP running.
We're not going to get OOPS display while running X without merging.
Something I would really like to have since I just had some and was
force to hook up a serial console.
It is just plain stupid having multiple device drivers fighting over
control of a single piece of hardware.  I thought we went over this
multiple times at OLS. There have been email discussions about this
since March.
