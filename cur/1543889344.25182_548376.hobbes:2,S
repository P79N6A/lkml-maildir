Because #define is a bit of a loose cannon when it comes to substitutions
and I didn't want nasty suprises. Also because ktermios may change in
future and I don't want to have to liase with 4 million port maintainers
when it does. The whole point of ktermios was to isolate the kernel and
user space views.
