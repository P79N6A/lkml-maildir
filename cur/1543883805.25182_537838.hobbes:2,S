Besides CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK I assume.  It is enough code so there is a
case for it.

Sorry old comment, that piece has been merged for a while.
It is the usb_debug module.  It creates a tty device that you
can just cat to get the usb debug output.

Maybe.  It has been long enough since I wrote the code
I need to go back and look.

Good point.  At least this early I'm not certain there is any
way I can productively do that.  This is before we have calibrated
the tsc's and the like so timeouts are difficult, and as I
recall our default guess isn't.
This lack of a good timeout looks to be the reason ehci_wait_for_port
doesn't timeout in a timely fashion because I don't timeout until
I have wrapped a 32bit number.

Could be.  I was thinking usb debug port. dbgp is at least unique,
and unfortunately it doesn't look like any old usb cable will
do, so a straight usb I expect would be very misleading.
The truth is I don't have a big need for this.  I put it together as
a proof of concept to see how hard it would be, etc.  I can clean
it up a little but I'm really hoping I can get this into one of
the development trees and people who have more use for it then I
do can play with it and improve things.
One persons experience on two machines probably isn't quite enough
of a sample to Document how to use this.  At least beyond what I
did in my changelog.
