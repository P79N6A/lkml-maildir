This would be in fact very interesting to know. 1) does the BUG trigger 
only with newer versions of bluez-utils? 2) If so, does everything work 
with these older versions, or do the things fail in a same way, but 
silently?

I would bet that the problem is that we don't know yet the correct 
vendor-specific report that is needed to be sent to the dongle to switch 
from HID to HCI mode.

Would you also be capable of catching the report which switches the dongle 
from HID to HCI in other operating system, for which there already is a 
support?
