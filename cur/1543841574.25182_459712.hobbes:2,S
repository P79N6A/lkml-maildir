It seems pretty clear that the UHCI controller hardware on your PCI card
isn't working.  The "len=-8/64" messages are a dead giveaway; you can't
get a negative length with a timeout failure if the controller is working
right.  At least, not unless you have some other USB devices already
attached to the same controller and using up all the bandwidth.
The fact that it fails in the same way with all the USB devices you attach 
is another indicator that the controller is bad.
