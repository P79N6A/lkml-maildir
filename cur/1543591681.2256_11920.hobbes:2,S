I'm not pessimistic, I'm fairly relaxed also with a 512Mbyte dynamic window
(that's why I did the change in first place) and I agree that it should
take care of hiding all those bugs on 99% of hardware configurations,
but OTOH I don't want things to work by luck and I'd prefer if the real
bugs gets fixed as well eventually.

you can do simultaneous I/O to all the disks, so you will keep those dma
entries for the SG for each disk in-use at the same time.

Certainly 64bit pci is supported but that doesn't change the fact you
can as well have 32bit devices on those boxes.

Exactly.
