Sorry for stupid question.
It is possible that we have busy inode that survives kill_super. One
possible scenario would be umount with MNT_DETACH.
In this case sb is gone and we have inode with i_sb pointing nowhere? What
happens then on any operation that tries to access sb, final iput in the
first case.
TIA
