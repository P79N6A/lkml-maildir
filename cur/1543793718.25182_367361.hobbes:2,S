Were these the comments from Andi to which you refer:
	
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.1/1237.html
The objections to microstate overhead seemed to stem from the syscall
overhead, not use of sched_clock() per se.
Andi, Ingo,
Are there problems with using sched_clock()for timestamping if one is prepared
to live with them not necessarily being nanosecond accurate ? I'm trying to search
the archives etc. but if you can respond with any quick comments, that'd be very
helpful.
Thanks,
Shailabh
