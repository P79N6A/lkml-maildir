No, i don't have a debian compiler and i normally use gcc 4.1 on my
workstation.
BTW I just heard that at least one package in suse STABLE (using a slightly 
older gcc 4.2 snapshot) apprently with inline assembly got miscompiled too

I guess it's because gcc 4.2 is technically supposed to be a -stable tree.
Also recompiling whole distros tends to find a lot of compiler bugs so
I guess it's useful QA for them.
