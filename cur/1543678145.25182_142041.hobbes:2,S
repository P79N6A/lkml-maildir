7m33s+23m29s+6m58s+35s minutes and seconds later, I have a working 2.4.21
PCMCIA Card came up just fine, cardbus continues to refuse to work.
Now if only DMA mode would work on the Opti 621 chipset inside this
Omnibook 5500/5700 hybrid laptop :)  Then it wouldn't take 38 minutes to
compile.  I knew I should have done this on the p4/2.53 that sits right
next to it!
But anyways, that's the way it goes
