Subject: Another 2.3.14p1 buglet, floppy mounting stalls
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

mounting the floppy stalls the mount process, D state.
the PC is set to all zeros, the WCHAN is wait_on_buf, the signal set
is:  ffff ffff fffb faef
popping the floppy out of the drive allows the mount program to fail and
exits cleanly.
strace of the mount program shows the stall in open("/dev/fd0",
O_RDONLY).
