Sight unseen I'm guessing that you have a kexec aware distro that is doing
something in the runlevel change scripts and thus unloading the kernel.
What do: /sys/kernel/kexec_loaded and /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded say?
kexec -e at any point should start a loaded kernel without problems, but it is
a lot like pressing the reset button.  Nothing is guaranteed to be shutdown
cleanly.  Now that journalling filesystems are the norm it is quite possible
nothing bad will happen to you.
