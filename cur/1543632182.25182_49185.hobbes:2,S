It should be a lot easier these days, and we should be fairly close.
A device driver should really _never_ see a "device number". It should see
a request queue and a disk/controller index, so that we can arbitrarily
map different device numbers to different devices (or sometimes to the
_same_ device).
But yes, there are lots of device drivers that right now use the device
number to get the disk/controller index by themselves, so right now the
minor/major numbers mean a bit too much.
