Yes, I've seen them. What's your point? A user with a braille terminal
can also 'see' that it's just a memcpy of the signal set, and doesn't
really need to scroll over to see the length argument to the memcpy,
except in very exceptional circumstances. The code flow is perfectly
understandable without doing so.

I count your theoretical blind person above as part of 'everyone'. By
gratuitously moving the 'fluff' onto a new line, he gets a whole line
taken up by it when he scrolls down. If it had stayed where I put it, it
wouldn't be getting in his way.
