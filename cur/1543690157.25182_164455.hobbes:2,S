Subject: [PATCH] IDE: Fix request handling with ide-default & ATAPI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Bart & Linus !
This patch fixes a bug that happens when a request gets to the
IDE layer for a drive using ide-default (that is with no
subdriver attached), like a Power Management request. In this
case, the core will wait for the device status to match
drive->read_stat, but that field contains by default a value
that is not suitable for ATAPI devices. This patch fixes it.
Linus, please apply (already validated with Bart)
