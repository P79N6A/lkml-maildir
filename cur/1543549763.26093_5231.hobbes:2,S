Yes.  The connection tracking code doesn't try to understand broadcast
packets, so when it sees the ping reply, it doesn't recognize it.  The
NAT code then drops the (untracked) packet.
The message has been very useful in highlighing connection tracking
problems in the past 8).
If you don't mind your box `leaking', you can simply comment out this
message and make NAT return NF_ACCEPT for this.
Rusty.
