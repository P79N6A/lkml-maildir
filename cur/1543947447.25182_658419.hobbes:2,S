Subject: [patch 29/38] hrtimer: catch expired CLOCK_REALTIME timers early
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
commit 63070a79ba482c274bad10ac8c4b587a3e011f2c
A CLOCK_REALTIME timer, which has an absolute expiry time less than
the clock realtime offset calls with a negative delta into the clock
events code and triggers the WARN_ON() there.
This is a false positive and needs to be prevented. Check the result
of timer->expires - timer->base->offset right away and return -ETIME
right away.
Thanks to Frans Pop, who reported the problem and tested the fixes.
