Is it really safe to treat the base address as a u32?  I know
if I was doing the BIOS and that address was tied to a 32bit BAR I
would be extremely tempted to put those 256M of address space above
4G.  Putting something like that below 4G leads to 1/2 Gig of memory
missing. 
You can also put the memory above 4G on most intel chipsets but I'd
rather have my memory down low where my legacy OS could get to it
rather than have my PCI extended configuration space down low where
nothing really needs it. 
Point being I don't think it is safe to assume the BIOS always puts
the extended PCI configuration space below 4G.
