Well, coneptually, an ioctl is the same as a sysctl. You allow the user /
sysadmin to toggle the behaviour. Given Linus' love for ioctls, I opted for
the sysctl.
But in principle, Andries is right: There's no reason why userspace can't
handle it, so removing the thing (maybe with a boot param for some time to
allow a smooth transition until all drivers are fixed) is the right thiing
to do.
