vmlinux is optional, if used it forms another cross check on the
validity of the kernel addresses.  That is why the default is -V for no
vmlinux.  You should still see the call trace and code lines, they
should be in the log immediately after the stack addresses.  Please
double check your log file to see if those lines are present.
There are three critical fields for an oops, the EIP, the call trace
and the code.  With only the eip it is almost impossible to determine
the cause of the problem.
