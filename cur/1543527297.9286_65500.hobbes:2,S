I never saw an argument for makeing the system non functional.
I did see an argument for new ``virtual devices'' which don't have
device nodes (so must either reside in procfs or devfs)  residing
in devfs.

Who do think is silently pushing devfs?
Linus has argued that sysctl is bad (hardcoded magic numbers).
Linus has argues that ioctl is bad (Not the UNIX way, all could/should go through read/write)
Others have argued procfs is bad (you can't handle device permissions...).
Richard Gooch argued devfs seems to handle these issues best...
The next day devfs was in the development kernel.
But I do agree there is no need to rush deployment or change.
However we are certainly moving in a devfs direction.
