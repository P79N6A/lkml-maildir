    Yes. 
    However, I think the _real_ bug is that we have reiserfs near the tail of 
    filesystems to try.
    Can you test that alternate patch instead? 
Funny how we alternate - when I choose the pure, theoretical point of view
you prefer practice, when I prefer practice you become pure.
This time you prefer practice: the list of filesystems is full of garbage
and good filesystems should be near the top.
I prefer theory: the kernel should not probe at all, so everybody who
forgets rootfstype= gets what he deserves.
Be that as it may - below a patch as I suppose you had in mind.
I don't like it very much. Ordering constraints in makefiles are bad.
Have not compiled or tested.
You can apply it I suppose, but after doing so my earlier patch is still
meaningful. Maybe you should also apply that (and the Doc update).
