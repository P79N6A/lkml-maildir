Use the e100 driver that Intel wrote.  It is much better and runs

My audio works fine with stock kernel 2.2.16. i810_audio.  I use RH 7.0.

I'm working on this.  There is a driver for the 2.2.x series kernels,
but I couldn't get it to work.  Beg Conexant to release a driver or
open source their code.
Someone wrote a program to change LCD contrast.  It works.  Try:

Let me know of any other things you encounter.
