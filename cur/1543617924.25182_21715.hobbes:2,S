It REALLY should be in user space.  Putting this kind of crap in the
kernel is insane.  Note also that *browsing* (network 'hood) is
different from *mounting* -- even on Windows it is very common that
there are computers you can't see in your browse windows that you can
access by name.
Consider DNS -- it *used* to be possible to enumerate DNS (these days,
most servers will deny access to you if you try), but it has been a
long, long time since it was ever practical.  However, you can do
blind resolution quite trivially.
