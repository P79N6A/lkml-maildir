I am currently developing support for an ep9xx based SBC and want to export
it's GPIO through sysfs in a simple and standard way,
without adding yet another platform specific gpio driver to the kernel.
As I understand it, a gpio class has already been begun by Robert Schwebel in
but has not as of yet become part of the mainstream kernel.
Searching the archives for this yields no results since 2006.
Can anyone point me to a current patch? 
I'd like to start from there.
thank you,
NZG
