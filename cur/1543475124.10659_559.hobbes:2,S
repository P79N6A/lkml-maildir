After being able to replicate my problem at will last week, I can no longer
do it. I have tried on 2.2.0-pre[3|4], with both oltr and ibmtr, and now
slist is working just fine. there have been no flood of packets coming from
my machine.
I can only assume that it was something on the LAN provoking my machine,
coincidentally only when I used 2.2.0.
I will continue to use 2.2.0 with oltr to see if the problem happens again.
