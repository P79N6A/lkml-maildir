Your patch 2 looks fine.
Patch 1 is somewhat questionable.  Certainly the log message reporting the
error should be left in.  The other issue is whether to continue with
probing other drivers.  I guess there's no reason not to; stopping short
was merely an optimization.
I'll discuss patch 3 in a separate message.
