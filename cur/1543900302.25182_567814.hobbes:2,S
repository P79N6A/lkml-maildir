For the mtrr trim patch at least, I think the coverage we've received 
in -mm is probably sufficient (the failure mode would be fairly 
obvious).  The only thing I'm nervous about is adding AMD support for 
the quirk, since I don't have any way of testing it.  We can easily add 
that later though, if a tester steps forward or we see demand for it 
(should just be an extra conditional in the trim code).
Thanks,
Jesse
