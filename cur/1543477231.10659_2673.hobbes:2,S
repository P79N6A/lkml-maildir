That race condition still exists in Linux 2.0.x.  So if you are vulnerable
to this attack in 2.2 you are also vulnerable in 2.0.x, it just may be a
little harder to exploit.

Since always in standard UNIX practice, if the file is already setuid.

A very bad practice -- if you are running around chowning things to root
without looking at what you're chowning, either directly or though a
script, you are in for a lot of trouble anyway the moment you venture
outside a pure-Linux environment.  Remedies include using an unprivileged
ID to chown to; mounting your user-writable partitions nosuid (or even
noexec); and regularly looking for suid files, e.g. AFTER you do your big
chowns.
Please look at other major versions of UNIX, and write back if you can find
at least one major flavor which has the behavior you want.  I have checked
IRIX, AIX, Solaris 2.x, and SunOS 4.x -- they are consistent with the new
Linux behavior when chowning setuid files as root.  I don't have any
Digital UNIX, BSD, SCO, UnixWare, or HP/UX systems handy right now, but if
you can find different behavior in ANY of them I'd like to hear about it.
