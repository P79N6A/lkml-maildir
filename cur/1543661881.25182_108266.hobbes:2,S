My problem is how to add the whitespace. The preprocessor seems to strip 
it. Consider this (test.S):
#define ENTRY(X) \
  .global X##; \
X##:   
ENTRY(foo)
ENTRY(bar)
gcc -S test.S:
.global foo; foo:
.global bar; bar:
For c4x-gcc, this has to be like this:
    .global foo
foo:
    .global bar
bar:
Without the leading whitespace, .global is taken as a name of a label. 
Without the newline before the labels, they are not recognized (taken as 
comments).
How can I tell the preprocessor to emit spaces and newlines?
