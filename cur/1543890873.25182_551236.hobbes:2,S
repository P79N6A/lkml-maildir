One is called "rowsize" the other "group_size". How about consistent
naming; either "row_size" and "group_size" or "rowsize" and
"groupsize" ?

I don't see the point in this (and the other) extra blank lines
between closing brace of one case and the start of the next. Removing
the blank line wouldn't hurt readability but would allow more lines of
code to be visible on the screen at once.
