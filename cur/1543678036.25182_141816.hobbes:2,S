Hmm, I guess a deadlock _is_ possible but I think the issue is more of
starvation.
And we can prevent starvation just by running the kernel thread at
FIFO/99, because then it will never be starved by a higher priority
task. If the RT task being starved is also at priority 99, it will
eventually block (as in our example, on console I/O) and let the kernel
thread run. If the RT task being starved is lower priority, then there
is nothing to worry about.
I guess a real deadlock could only occur if the FIFO/99 task does not
block on the resource the kernel thread is providing but busy loops
waiting for it.
It is all a trade off, and rarely a pleasant one...
