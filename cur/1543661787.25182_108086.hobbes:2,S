Is this really a good idea? get_cycles is normally not used to get accurate
time, but just to get random numbers for /dev/random or quickly estimate
some code (scheduler used to use it for that). I think the TSC even when
unsynchronized is better for that than an external timer which potentially
lower resolution and long access time.
If you really added it I would at least change the random device to 
use the old macro.
