Perhaps you are, but other people have been complaining about things
changing between 2.0.x and 2.2.x, and between 2.1.x and 2.1.y.

I'm a little curious, how many times have this happened actually? So
far all examples I've seen have are the same ioctl padding change
hashed over and over again. A change that looks more like a mistake to
me than a deliberate design change. (that is, the a new ioctl should
have been used, and the old one kept for compatibility at least for
the 2.0.x series, a method that has been used before, IIRC.)  Mistakes
are bad enough, but it's not the same thing as doing arbitrary design
changes.
