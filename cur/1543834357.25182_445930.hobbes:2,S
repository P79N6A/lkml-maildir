It doesn't seem to fix all problems. On CPU unplug, I still get deadlocks 
through some workqueue:
 [<c03af64a>] __mutex_lock_slowpath+0x4d/0x7b
 [<c03af687>] .text.lock.mutex+0xf/0x14
 [<c0137591>] __lock_cpu_hotplug+0x36/0x56
 [<c01375ca>] lock_cpu_hotplug+0xa/0xc
 [<c012f7c2>] flush_workqueue+0x2d/0x61
 [<c012f83b>] flush_scheduled_work+0xd/0xf
 ...
and the nasty part is that this can apparently hit _any_ process that 
wants to flush workqueues (in one particular case, it was through 
tty_release() -> release_dev() in drivers/char/tty.c).
The whole CPU hotplug locking seems to be broken.
