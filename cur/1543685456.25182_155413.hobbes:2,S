I tried again without the usb-modules and the mouse is still going
crazy after an apm-suspend. Of course dmesg now only sees the error
messages concerning the mouse:
Suspending devices
Enabling SEP on CPU 0
Devices Resumed
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 3 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.

Greetings, 
Klaus.
