OK, I think by now we've all agreed the following:
 - The issue is NOT displaying temperatures to the user, but a userspace
   program reading them from the kernel.  The userspace program itself can
   do temperature conversions for the user if he/she wants.
 - The most preferable units would be decikelvins, as the value can give a
   relatively precise as well as wide range of numbers ranging from absolute
   zero to about 6340 degrees Celsius ((65535 / 10) - 273) which is well
   within anything that a computer can operate.  It also gives us a good
   base for all sorts of other temperature sensing devices.
Do we all agree on those now?
