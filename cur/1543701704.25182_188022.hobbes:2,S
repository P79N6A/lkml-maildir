Sorry the reply is so belated, but by the time this patch came along I
was feeling like I had been more than a little foolish to test this on
a live (and very necessary) system as I had been doing.  I've finally
gotten hardware rearranged so that I can feel safe about this.

Okay, by now I have 2.4.23 installed, and with that version (and booting
from a drive not connected to the Promise controller, a mirror pair on
a 3ware controller, in fact) I no longer seem to be able to recreate
the corruption that was previously so repeatable.  The autotune
parameter makes no difference: it just works.
If this issue is still of interest (ie, it's just by luck that .23
works), I can do further testing for a while, but the drive that's on
the Promise will be getting repurposed sooner or later.
