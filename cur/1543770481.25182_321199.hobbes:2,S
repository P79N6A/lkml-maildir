Thanks for the reply!
Well this seems straight-forward enough, but it doesn't seem to work for 
me.. see if I have everything straight..
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    if(fork())
    { /* parent */
       sleep(15);
    }
    else
    { /* child */
       printf("setpgrp returned: %d\n",setpgrp());
       sleep(5);
    }
}
I run the program.. setpgrp is returning zero.. then I quickly look at 
the ps listing.. the child's pid is still the parent's, but that may be 
okay..     Then after 5 seconds when the child exits.. I do the ps again 
and I do still see that the child is now defunct.. the desired effect is 
that the child would go away because I don't care what the exit status 
was.  I was thinking that if init could become the parent of the newly 
forked child, then it would clean it up when it exits.
Any ideas?
