yes, that's exactly what e100 was doing on my laptop last month.  Fixed
that by arranging for the NIC to be reset before the call to
pci_set_master().
I expect the adaptec driver could be fixed by calling ahc_reset() from a
strategic place in either ahc_linux_pci_dev_probe() or in the shutdown
handler.  (Does the crashdump code call shutdown handlers?  Sounds like a
bad idea...)
