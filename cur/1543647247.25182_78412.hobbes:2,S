Because Sparc64/s390x/? still need to tell highuid.h to do macro magic for
NEW_TO_OLD_UID() and friends in some places and not others.  A CONFIG_XXX
applies all the time to all files.
We can make the few sparc64/s390x sections just redefine the macros they
want in the files in question, if you prefer, but uid16.c is still a user of
highuid.h and needs to define __UID16.  If you prefer, __UID16 can be called
DO_HIGHUID_CONVERSIONS.
#define DO_HIGHUID_CONVERSIONS
#include <linux/uid16.h>
Or have a new uid16.h that unconditionally defines the macros.  Then
highuid.h can include uid16.h IFF CONFIG_UID16, and uid16.c can include
uid16.h.  I see this as MORE problematic, because someone, somewhere will
include uid16.h when they meant highuid.h.  Forcing a non CONFIG_UID16 arch
to explicity call out "I want uid16 macro conversion for THIS FILE" seems
safe.  Ugly, but safe.
