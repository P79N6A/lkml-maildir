Would be interesting.  The underlying assumptions of compare-by-hash
are a) a cryptologically strong hash and b) a sufficient hash space.
Since noone has proven a) yet for any hash, it is necessary to store
multiple hashes and just ignore one of them as soon as that particular
hash is proven to be weak.
As a side-effect, you could search for hash collisions this way.  A
new block that has the same md5 hash as some other, but a new sha1 and
crc32 hash tells you a lot. :)
