Sigh...  There are two operations.
	1) set the timestamp to user-supplied value.  Owner-only.
	2) have the timestamp set to _now_.  Obviously can be done not
only by the owner (think of e.g. write(2)); having write access is
sufficient.
ATTR_MTIME_SET is the former.  ATTR_MTIME without ATTR_MTIME_SET is the
latter and that's what utimes(foo, NULL) ends up doing.
