Andrew found a spinlock use bug in efivars_exit that needs to get fixed 
first.  Then I'm fine with it.
efibootmgr 0.5.0-test1 is available at 
http://domsch.com/linux/ia64/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test1.tar.gz
which supports both /proc-style and sysfs-style accesses.  With additional 
feedback that it works as expected for several people, I'll remove the 
'test' moniker.
Thanks,
Matt
