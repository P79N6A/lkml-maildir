I have updated to Linux 2.2.11 on RedHat 6.0. Everything seems ok,
except for the kernel frame buffer in Linux 2.2.11 kernel. Now for
each CPU, it draws a penguin at the top of screen. However, during
the startup, the colors used in rc scripts for "[ OK ]" and
"[ Failed ]" are all wrong. Now, green in "[ OK ]" is grey and red
in "[ Failed ]" is brown. The strange thing is after it goes into
runlevel 3, the colors come back during shutdown. It seems that
something happens from runlevel 1 to runlevel 3, which fixes the
color in the kernel frame buffer. Any ideas?
BTW, colors in penguin at the top of screen during boot seem ok.
