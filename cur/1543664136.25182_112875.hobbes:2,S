I believe deep queues might work well if the drives did their own
anticipatory scheduling.  After all, they know both true geometry and
excact rotational position and latency.
But current drives aren't that good so all the deep queue achieves is
extra seeks which sometimes kills performance.  The fix is simple -
shorten the queues.  Long ones aren't really a goal by itself -
performance is.
