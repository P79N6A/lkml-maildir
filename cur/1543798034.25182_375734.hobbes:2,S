The bug in this case was the (implicit) BROKEN dependency of MTD_SHARP.

Such corner cases could easily be handled using
	depends on (BROKEN || SA1100_COLLIE)
Or in other cases wie have
	depends on (BROKEN || !64BIT)
If it works its not BROKEN, and we can express this.

The vast majority of drivers depending on BROKEN simply don't compile.
How many examples besides MTD_SHARP can you name where you have problems 
to determine why something is marked as BROKEN?

The idea behind BROKEN is to not offer drivers where we know that they 
don't compile or will for sure not work to users.
The ARM case that people are using the supplied defconfig's more or less 
unchanged is a big exception.
