Hi
I'm interested in creating a Linux Beta testing site, with number of
hosts
and QA people to do an extensive test for new ( and old ) beta versions
of the kernel.
I would appreciate opinions about (a) if this is a good idea at all, and
(b) how
should such an operation work ?
Given the huge amount of different h/w combination possible, I
understand that
this will be a costly matter so you don't need to tell me that :-)
I am interested in thoughts on what the procedures should be like,
what part of the kernel I should emphasize on, and anything you
think is related .
Thanks !
