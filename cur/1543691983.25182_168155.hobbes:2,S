Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Re-xmit.
Name: Minor Tweaks To Jamie Lokier & Hugh Dickins's Futex Patch
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Booted on 2.6.0-test5-bk3
Depends: Misc/futex-split-lock.patch.gz
D: Minor changes to Jamie & Hugh's excellent futex patch.
D: 1) Remove obsolete comment above hash array decl.
D: 2) Clarify comment about TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.
D: 3) Andrew Morton says spurious wakeup is a bug.  Catch it.
D: 4) Use Jenkins hash.
D: 5) Make hash function non-inline.
