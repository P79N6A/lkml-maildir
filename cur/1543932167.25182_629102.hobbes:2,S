OK, but this would be much clearer to adopt the X86_64 way, define
MAX_INSN_SIZE one smaller and make this line:
/* Copy original instruction plus space for 1 byte relative jump */
memcpy(p->ainsn.insn, p->addr, MAX_INSN_SIZE + sizeof(kprobe_opcode_t));
See the first patch of my cleanup work that unified MAX_INSN_SIZE
and you'll see why this jumped out.
