Forgive me, but what does 'registered' strictly refer to? It is ECC RAM,
in a single 512Mb module, but more than that, I don't know.
But the key question is still this: is this purely a hardware issue? My
understanding is that with recent 2.4 kernels, Athlon optimisations and
AMD 760 issues are sorted - am I right?
Perhaps 2.4.15-pre4 would actually work, if I could fix the initrd
problem...? Since most -ac stuff is in there, I opted for that rather
than 2.4.13-acX for now, but maybe I should drop back to that?
Cheers
Alastair
