Ok, 
a) why do you want to shape on ingress instead of policing?
OR
b) Why cant you achieve the same results by marking on ingress and
shaping on egress?

By multiple clients i believe you mean you want to say "-i ppp+"?
We had a long discussion on this a while back (search netdev) 
and i think it is a valid point for dynamic devices like ppp. 
We need to rethink how we do things. Theres a lot of valu in having per
device tables (scalability being one).
IMO, this alone does not justify the existence of IMQ. 
We should do this (and other things) right, maybe a sync with the
netfilter folks will be the right thing to do. 
cheers,
