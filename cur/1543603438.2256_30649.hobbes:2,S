Has anyone noticed that certain websites that use to load reliable are no
longer accessible? I used to be able to get into www.nvidia.com and now it
doesn't load. The reason I believe this might be a kernel problem is what
happened when I changed on the same system to kernel 2.2.19-7.0.8smp
(RedHat 7.0 kernel). When I switched to that kernel the website loaded
with out problems. Nothing changed on the same. Same software used with
all the kernels I have used.
The kernel version that I have noticed the problem:
2.4.10-ac4
2.4.9-ac16
Not sure if I noticed it on earlier versions. I will check again.
How can I track down the what is really causing the problem.
