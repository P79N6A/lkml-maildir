Hi!
  I was experimenting with some code. I wanted to see if it was possible
to call up(&some_semaphore) from inside the schdular. Well it hosed my
system. I have tried to trace threw the code to find out what could be
causing me my problems but found nothing. What could be causing the
problem. Thank you.
