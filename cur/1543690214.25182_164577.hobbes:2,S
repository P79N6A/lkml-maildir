regarding to fs/ext2/ioctl.c it should be EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION, shouldn't it?

Hello,
thanks a lot, it seems to work pretty well.
Since I have never used the ioctl() call before I only want to be sure I don't 
do something wrong,  I think this is correct, isn't it?
int ret, igen;
ret = ioctl(fd, EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION, &igen);
It also works for reiserfs-partitions with the very same call, @reiserfs-team, 
this won't change in the future, will it?
Cheers,
	Bernd
