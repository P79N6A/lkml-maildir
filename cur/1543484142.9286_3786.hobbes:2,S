This is wrong. *Do not apply this patch*. If you rely on file locking
and your lock daemon happens to be unreachable your machine will
continue away without realising if you use this patch. A week layer when
you notice your mail spool will be full of corrupt mailboxes and your
user base will hate you while your manager demands you change OS.
Use the "nolock" mount option. That tells Linux you know there is no
file locking, you don't care there is no file locking, you aren't using
remote file locking.
