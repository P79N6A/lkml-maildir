ide_raw_taskfile() sets rq.special to &ar - and &ar is on the stack,
in this function. Later it falls through to __ide_end_request(), which
does
  ar = rq->special;
  ...
  if (ar)
    ata_ar_put(drive, ar);
    
which adds this ar into drive's free_req chain unconditionally. Maybe 
ata_ar_put should check for ar_queue validity. And where ar_queue
member is initialized (or at least cleared) in this case at all?
Unfortunately here my knowledge ends.
