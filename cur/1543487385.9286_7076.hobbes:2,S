They are defined for BSD and SYS5 sources (__USE_MISC)

The kernel doesn't provide libraries with defines, at least never directly.
You probably have gcc -ansi or -D_POSIX_SOURCE or similar defined. These
extra facilities arent part of a strict posix system.
The default is that we assume BSD/SYS5 type stuff so its enabled and
visible. You can also force this by saying -D_BSD_SOURCE for BSD extensions
