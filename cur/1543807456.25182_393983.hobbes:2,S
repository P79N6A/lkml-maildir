Well, yes, and it did.  The problem was that if you turned off ACLs,  
it didn't work; only one or two variants of about 6 or 8 ways to  
configure reiserfs stopped working.  Given that, I can't see how Hans  
is complaining about lack of QC.  Nobody is going to test patches  
against every possible kernel configuration; that's why we do an RC,  
so that we can get a lot of different configs tested.
Cheers,
