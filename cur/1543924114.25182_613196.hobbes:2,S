Speaking of which, the patch introduced a strict-aliasing warning (that 
is, common userspace program compilation would warn about such) at:
+       return *((void **)&tmpl + type);
&tmpl is of type struct paravirt_patch_template **, and cross-casting 
this to void ** usually gives a strict-aliasing warning.
A workaround is to pre-cast to void *,
	return *((void **)(void *)&tmpl + type);
is that ok?
