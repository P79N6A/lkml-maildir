Ick indeed... That sounds pretty nasty now that we have SMP and preemptive 
kernels.
I've restarted work on the alternative: putting basic BSD ucreds + VFS changes 
in first. It's a lot of work, but I think it will be worth it.
FYI a BSD ucred is basically a structure of the form
struct ucred {
	int	counter;		/* Reference counter */
	uid_t	uid;			/* task->fsuid */
	gid_t	gid;			/* task->fsgid */
	int	ngroups;		/* task->ngroups */
	gid_t	*groups;		/* task->groups */
};
The reference counter + the copy-on-write rule allows you to share it around 
to other parts of the kernel (struct file, low level filesystems, ...). By 
copy-on-write I mean that once it has been shared, nobody is allowed to 
change the values of the data structures (except the reference counter).
Means that you don't need any form of locking for this structure apart from 
perhaps in those rare CLONE_CRED instances when you are actually changing the 
shared ucred in the task_struct for all the threads.
Cheers,
  Trond
