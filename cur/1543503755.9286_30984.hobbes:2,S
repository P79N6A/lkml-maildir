Absurd? My greatest problem seems to be the PCI DMA burst size of the
card I'm using now.
Driving the PC speaker at 8 kHz interrupt rate or higher is a no brainer
with RTL. (I've done it at 85 kHz on a dual P-II 233 with periodic
scheduling, but that's burning lots of CPU power on scheduling, and the
jitter is [probably] bigger than the average latency.)
I'll add an RTL hook into the interrupt handler of the hacked driver and
put it on the site for download. However, unless I can run the card in
non-DMA mode or something, I'll get nowhere near the lowest audio
latency possible with RTL.

Ok... Say you have the CPU processing data using 80% of the avaiable
cycles. That is, the minimum time it can take to process one buffer is
80% of the time it takes to play it.
Now, for some reason, the processing task doesn't get started in time.
If this delay is within the maximum allowed limits, the engine will
still be available to deliver the output buffer in time.
However, when the next buffer comes in, it has to *wait* until the
current (delayed) one is processed, thus causing the next buffer to be
delayed as well! The engine will cath up after a few buffers, as the
load is less than 100%.
But what if your process loses the CPU once again before it has cathed
up...?

True, but I was actually thinking about interrupt and scheduling
latencies here. I'm being unclear again, obviously. Maximum latency =
average latency + maximum deviation due to jitter. Anyway, the problem
is that your code doesn't always get control in time, and/or that it can
sometimes lose control before it's done. (For a deadline to be met, the
task must actually both be scheduled in time AND get the chance to
finish before the deadline.) What more is there to it really?
