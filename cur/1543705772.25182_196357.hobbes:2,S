Any connection here with making linux fs easier to learn?
I ask because I've not found any reasonably quick way of making sense
of:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/udf/
developed at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-udf/
I see I can trivially make that fs fail fsck and patch fs/udf to teach
gdb to print the structures on disc.  I see less trivially I can
persuade that fs to read back what I did not write.  But as yet I have
not more directly helped improve the fs/udf/ code.

Thank you from that I found:
the AVFS project page on sourceforge
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf/
AVFS - A Virtual File System
http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/avfs/
Also I see this FUSE is not sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/.
