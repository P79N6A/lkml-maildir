Subject: MSI entry unlinked before arch_teardown_msi_irq().

Eric, you recommended to me that I use:
	struct msi_desc *entry = get_irq_data(irq);
in my arch_teardown_msi_irq() routine earlier, but the current
code unlinks the entry before the call to arch_teardown_msi_irq()
so I get OOPS's on shutdown on sparc64 because of this since
get_irq_data() will return NULL at that point.
Can you fix this up or suggest how I should code the patch to
your liking so I can take care of it?
Thanks!
