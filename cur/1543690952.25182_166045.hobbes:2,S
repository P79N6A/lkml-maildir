	You are mistaken about what this is. This is not an exception being
granted. Nobody has the authority to grant GPL exceptions unless they are
the sole author and the Linux kernel does not have a sole author.

	This is not a license provision, it's a license interpretation. If you can
show me why the interpretation doesn't apply to kernel modules, please do.

	Except it's not a license grant. If it is a license grant, please tell me
who had the authority to grant it.

	Hahahahhahaha! Oh, that's too funny. "All dogs are mammals" means things
that aren't dogs aren't mammals? My pencil isn't a "user program". Is it a
derivative work of the Linux kernel in your opinion?

	The same way a user program that runs within the context of the Linux
operating system is not a derivative work. A defined interface creates a
license boundary. If you can draw a line between the two works, neither is
derivative of the other.
	And you are still ignoring the entire point, which is that it doesn't
matter whether or not such modules are derivative works. The GPL puts no
restrictions whatsoever on the creation or usage of derivative works that
are not distributed. The GPL does not say that you cannot make derivative
works unless you GPL them.
	So the restriction GPL_ONLY places is *not* a restriction that exists in
the GPL which is the *only* license. Hence it does not enforce a license
restriction. It really is that simple.
	And when it comes to respecting the author's wishes, I respect the wishes
of the many people who contributed to the Linux kernel expecting the GPL to
ensure that usage remained unrestricted. I don't not respect the wishes of
the people who try to impose usage restrictions on other people's GPL'd code
and I thoroughly disrespect those who would wield the DMCA to restrict
modifications to code placed under the GPL.
