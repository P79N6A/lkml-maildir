I think that this race will never trigger but according to me rmb() may be
still desiderable. We must make sure to read p->has_cpu after p->state.
Maybe our CPU reads p->has_cpu and see 0, before reading p->state and
seeing TASK_ZOMBIE, and between the two reads the other cpu scheduled the
task `p' and the task `p' exits and p->state get set to ZOMBIE but do_exit
has still to complete (has_cpu is 1 but the other CPU think it's 0
because it read has_cpu out of order).
And it's sure not needed in i386 because before calling release() there is
a read_unlock() that will issue a lock on the bus, but I think for other
archs a lock on the bus is not enough to flush the CPU-OOO queue.
The spinlock in the current code would have synchronized the reads as
rmb() can do.
                for (;;)  {
                        int has_cpu;
			rmb()
                        has_cpu = p->has_cpu;
                        if (!has_cpu)
                                break;
                        do {
                                barrier();
                        } while (p->has_cpu);
                }
