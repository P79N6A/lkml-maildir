This shuts off a router and/or firewall just because iSCSI or NFS peed
in it's pants.  Not really acceptable.

It's not desirable.
What if iSCSI is protected by IPSEC, and the key management daemon has
to process a security assosciation expiration and negotiate a new one
in order for iSCSI to further communicate with it's peer when this
memory shortage occurs?  It needs to send packets back and forth with
the remove key management daemon in order to do this, but since you
cut it off with this critical receive pool, the negotiation will never
succeed.
This stuff won't work.  It's not a generic solution and that's
why it has more holes than swiss cheese. :-)
