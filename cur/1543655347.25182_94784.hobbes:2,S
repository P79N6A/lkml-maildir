I had the same problem on an old Compaq 2500 with 320Mb memory,
the following line used to work :
        append="mem=320M"
now I have to use:
        append="mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=319M@1M"
to get the kernel to see all the memory.
So probably you can get it working again with:
        append="mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=1023M@1M"
Maybe you also could do directly: exactmap mem=1024M@0
or 1G@0, but I haven't tried that yet.
It seems the mem parameter now only can be used to limit the amount of memory 
used by the kernel.
