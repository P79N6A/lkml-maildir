A bitmap allocator made sense because it has the property of making 
allocations compact. Once that requirement is relaxed, it does not make 
any sense to use it (and you have still to modify it in any case).
I generally agree on code re-use, but that just not the right structure. 
You can tweak it how much you like, but you're still doing a search inside 
an N-sized bitmap. It's just the *wrong* structure.
I-cache pressure? All the extra code that you see out of fdmap.c/h, comes 
from handling two "bitmaps", that you still have to have (unless you 
plan to have a single huge botmap that covers legacy and non-sequential 
areas). But with a bitmap structure, you're gonna have more D-cache 
pressure. And that's a fact.
