Subject: Re: [PATCH] SCSI core: always store >= 36 bytes of INQUIRY data

This patch (as810c) copies a minimum of 36 bytes of INQUIRY data,
even if the device claims that not all of them are valid.  Often badly
behaved devices put plausible data in the Vendor, Product, and Revision
strings but set the Additional Length byte to a small value.  Using
potentially valid data is certainly better than allocating a short
buffer and then reading beyond the end of it, which is what we do now.

This is the final version submitted to James Bottomley on Oct. 31.  
Apparently he hasn't applied it yet, and there hasn't been any word back 
on whether he intends to.
