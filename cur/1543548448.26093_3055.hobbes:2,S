Shrug. So you want me to make it worse by shipping unproven code in a way
I can't test it ?

And FreeBSD people flow steadily to Linux too. Personally I don't actually care
See if FreeBSD is the better OS for a given job then use it for that. If Linux
is the better OS use that.
2.2 is the stable branch, my job is to keep it stable. That means I have a 
permanent queue of neat things I really want to apply but can't right now.
