I just tried gcc 3.3.3 and the kernel gets a little bigger but it boots
and runs OK. That's the oldest compiler I can find.
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename

Looking at the generated code, it seems the compiler just makes dumb
choices and tends to recompute current_thread_info() in unlikely code
paths even when there is no register pressure.  4.0.2 makes better
choices.
