Hello,
The problem seems to affect more chipsets than suspected.
Is it possible that it is indeed not a quirk as David Brownell suspects?
I am getting this:
ohci_hcd: 2004 Feb 02 USB 1.1 'Open' Host Controller (OHCI) Driver (PCI)
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:02:00.0[D] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 19

the deviceinfo from lspci -n/-v:

         Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 19
         Memory at d3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
If wanted I will test with a USB debug enabled kernel as soon as I physically 
get to my box.
It would be nice if you'd cc me on Reply as I'm not subscribed.
Greets,
