Ok. I'll do that later this afternoon.

I was thinking of that bit of code in ip_gre.c which I sent the fix for
recently. Unless I've missed something it calls update_pmtu on the dst
which is passed by the encapsulated protocol, although I've not actually
tested that.
Thats the reason I wasn't sure about the fix which I sent... it deleted the
duplicated call only for IPv4 rather than the one which appears to get called
for every protocol as I wasn't sure what was intended.
Either way it seems reasonable to pass this information back to the
protocol so perhaps it should say (in ipgre_tunnel_xmit()):
	if (skb->dst && skb->dst->ops->update_pmtu)
		skb->dst->ops->update_pmtu(skb->dst, mtu);
?
Steve.
