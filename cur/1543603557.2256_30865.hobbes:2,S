Yes, limiting to 2 CPU's probably gets better cache behaviour, and it
might be worth looking into why it doesn't. The CPU affinity _should_
prioritize it down to two, but I haven't thought through your theory about
IPI latency.
However, the reason 2.2.x does so well is that in 2.2.x it will stay on
_once_ CPU if I remember correctly. We basically tuned the scheduler for
lmbench, and not much else.
