How about an option, either the jiffy timer wraps at 5 minutes or
process 1 gets sent a SIGINT after 24 hours ? That way a driver
with an MIA author can still be used even if it's buggy, just not
for very long.
Okay ... perhaps it should be just an option of jiffy wrap at 5 mins
or 24 hours, but I still think reboot is better :-) :-P
