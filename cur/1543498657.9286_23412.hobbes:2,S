I don't buy 0E for a minute.  According to my books, 0E is the floppy
interrupt for the CPU - and what the hell does that have to do with
anything when it's not even accessed?  It tells you nothing.

Uh, yeah, a user will know EXACTLY what that means.  I do, but a user
won't.

It's a stereotype.  Maybe you don't know this, but stereotypes lend
themselves to prejudice.  And besides, you fail to understand one thing:
"Fucked up" is something that is MANY TIMES MORE MAJOR than "screwed up"
or something to that effect.  I don't *care* what you say... it's a
stronger word and therefore conveys a stronger meaning.  It's not
egotistical babbletalk.
And Linux sells itself on its reliability.  If you don't feel comfortable
selling programs with "dirty" source, you better stop selling programs
period.  Especially Microsoft and other companies' programs with lots of
code in it.

Nope they don't.  And that analogy has no relevancy whatsoever.
If you guys are gonna pick on Linux, then pick on other programs equally.
They do it as much if not more than Linux does.

Hah!
I advocate OSs that are reliable and give users flexibility to do what
they want, and are free.  Thus far, Linux fits that.  And Linux is very
portable, too.

That is part of the reason that I use it.
