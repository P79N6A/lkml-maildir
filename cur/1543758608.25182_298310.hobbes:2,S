I like the first part of the documentation, that's nice.
But I don't like the new kref_get_with_check() function that you
implemented.  If you look in the -mm tree, kref_put() now returns if
this was the last put on the reference count or not, to help with lists
of objects with a kref in it.
Perhaps you can use that to implement what you need instead?
thanks,
