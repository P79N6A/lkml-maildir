With kernel 2.6.0 I can't type '\' in text mode. If I press this key and I
am in text mode what happens is that I change console, as if I had pressed
Alt+Fn. But in X it works just fine.
I have also tested 2.6.0-test11-mm1, where I get the same behaviour in
text mode. But in this kernel it doesn't work also in X, where pressing
'\' prints nothing on my screen.
The keyboard is a Logitech USB Internet Navigator Keyboard, connected
through USB.
