AFAIK, there is currently no Xen support for PMU on any platforms. By "support"
I mean suport for guests using the PMU. As such, I do not think this works.
I am planning on looking at this next because this is becoming a pressing matter
and not just on IA-64.
My first goal is to ensure that a guest using perfmon2 works once it is virtualized.
That implies that the Xen VMM does save/restore PMU state on guest switch. That's a bare
minimum.
As for HW virutlization support, I think it helps a little bit but there still needs to
be some additional code in the VMM to make this work correctly. This is also something
I want to look at.
