Thanks!

Hmm.. The timer waits 5 seconds before trying to prefetch, but then only stops 
if it detects any activity elsewhere. It doesn't actually try to go idle in 
between but it doesn't take much activity to put it back to sleep, hence 
detecting yet another "not quite idle" period and then it goes to sleep 
again. I guess the sleep interval can actually be changed as another tunable 
from 5 seconds to whatever the user wanted.

Well the advantage is twofold potentially; 1. the pages that have been 
prefecthed and become minor faults when they would have been major faults, 
and 2. those that become minor faults (via 1) and then become major faults 
again (since a copy is kept on backing store with swap prefetch). The 
sp_tester only tests for 1, although it would be easy enough to simply do 
another big malloc at the end and see how fast it swapped out again as a 
marker of 2. As for an in-kernel option, it could get kind of expensive 
tracking pages that have done one or both of these. I'll think about an 
affordable way to do this, perhaps it could be just done as a 
debugging/testing patch, but if would be nice to make it cheap enough to have 
there permanently as well. The pages end up in swap cache (in the reverse 
direction pages normally get to swap cache) so the accounting could be done 
somewhere around there.
