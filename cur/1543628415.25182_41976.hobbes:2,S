A related thing to look at would be the Plan 9 file system.
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/
It is an entirely different design using copy-on-write and a
form of snapshotting such that something like:
cd //2001/12/25/foo
puts the user in directory /foo as it was at daily backup time
on Christmas day last year.
The original Plan 9 system used WORM drives with hard drives
acting as cache. I suspect the design could work without WORM.
