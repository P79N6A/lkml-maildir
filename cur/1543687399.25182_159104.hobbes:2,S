A decent fallocate() implementation requires that the underlying fs has a
permanent representation of blocks which are in an "allocated,
uninitialised" state.  afaik XFS is the only such filesystem.
It's a fair bit of work for what doesn't really sound a very useful
feature.  Doing it in libc is reasonable.  Probably the libc implementation
could be improved by using ioctl(FIBMAP) and O_DIRECT to mimimise IO and
CPU utilisation.

Nope.
