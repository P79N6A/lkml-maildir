These functions were defined for other archs in asm-generic/iomap.h.
We need all archs including it in io.h. I now see only few archs are
including it..
Apart from unxlate, there is also ioremap_wc which is defined in the
same way.
I can send a patch for this. But, I don't have cross compiler setup for
all archs to test. Andrew, I will need your help.
Thanks,
