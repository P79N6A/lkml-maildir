Subject: missing sched.h comments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Tidy up sched.h a bit.
(1) ->personality has a "???" comment sitting above it. Comment it.
(2) a comment referring to the nonexistent field ->father from before
	the pidhash merge persists. Remove the comment. The replacements
	are all already commented.
(3) ->did_exec, ->leader, ->used_math, and ->keep_capabilities are all
	boolean, and may fit into the same word. Also comment them.
