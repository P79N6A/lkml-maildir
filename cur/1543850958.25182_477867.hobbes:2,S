You don't want to do that. It is the duty of the plugger to unplug the
device again, and in your case that is probably deferred to the timer
auto-unplug. So don't involve plugging, it's a seperate thing. Just
leave the request function when elv_next_request(), and always recall it
when you are done completing requests.

Perhaps it recalls ->request_fn() more often than it should. If you call
