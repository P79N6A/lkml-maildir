Dear all
    I am new to kernel driver development. Thanks for any help.
    I am modifing a USB Ramdisk to a USB mass storage(MTD) driver in a 
dragonball ARM9 platform.  I stop when using tasklet. The USB driver 
setup with endpoint 1 and 2 to be Interrupt IN and OUT point. So when 
ever there is a interrupt , I schedule the tasklet to read or write with 
semphone variable protection.
    The problem i am facing is that the read/write process is TOO SLOW 
for the host to response. I have tried to not use tasklet and call the 
read/write function directly, it works with small file but "schedule in 
interrupt" oops prompt out when transfer a large file . I have also try 
to use spin_lock_irqsave.. but it will stop the interrupt...
    I am in a hurry on this. Please give me a hand.
    Thanks
Mike,Lee
