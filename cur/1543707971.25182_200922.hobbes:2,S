Which ones don't?  The burden is on you, not me. The Bourne like shells
that I happen to try just now _do_ display syntax error messages in
shell scripts with the name of the shell script file in the error
message.  Look and see how they are getting that script file name.
What's theoretical on one persons machine is very real and painful
on a million persons machines.  Incompatible changes in documented
interfaces have a high threshold to overcome.
