Indeed, and even if you're talking about kernel x.y.z the
user might in fact be running a vendor-patched kernel with a newer
version of the driver (and the author would still have to find out
what version of the driver was included).
For other things the version string is pretty useless as it isn't ever
updated (e.g. networking), and there the kernel version is enough
information.
What I'd propose is a recommendation that modules in 
addition to the "useful" information a module should print
a maximum of one line (80 chars), and the author gets to
choose what they want in there, version information, driver homepage,
copyright, sponsor, whatever.
I just hope we never get to the point of having a "Memory leak removal
sponsored by Tampax" boot message ;)
