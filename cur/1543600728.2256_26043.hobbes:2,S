  For a workaround until it is fixed properly, find RADEON_SOFT_RESET_HDP
in your kernel radeon driver source and kill it.  Possibly XFree86 CVS
source is fixed already, but anyway you need to change and compile some
modules from XFree86 source too and install them to where the X server
will find them.
  Check out dri.sf.net -> project -> bug [ #221904 ] Radeon + AMD
Irongate.
