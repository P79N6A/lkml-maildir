Probably, ide code was idle for some time :). As I said to Chris, there
are a bunch of things I want to do to the code over the weekend, I
wanted to get something out there before that though (raises the
incentive to finish it)

Doesn't work for split flush, ie issue a bunch of flushes to devices,
then wait for them. I agree using ->wrq and special_buf is ugly as hell,
though.

That's what I wanted to avoid, adding more flags. However, if you see
the comment in there this is being changed to ->issue_flush() instead.
So it's dying, don't worry.

Ok

Ehm, because it _is_ a REQ_BLOCK_PC? ;-)

To ensure previously written data is on platter first.
