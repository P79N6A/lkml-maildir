The driver is probably good enough but because you have to call into the
Linux kernel to use them. With a guest kernel setup  you can forget about
realtime then. With PREEMPT_RT you get hard realtime behaviour out of the
box.
Ofcourse, there is a lot of buts to that. You have to check that the
driver doesn't take a call path which is nontermnistic in special cases
and the path between your application and the driver is deterministic.
A static code checker would be nice...
