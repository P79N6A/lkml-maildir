Well if we changed the include dir to look like this:
   include/linux/bar.h
   include/asm/foo.h
   include/asm-powerpc/asm/foo.h
   include/asm-frv/asm/foo.h doesn't exist, defaults to generic version.
Then I suppose you could carefully order the -I directives like this:
   gcc [...] -Iinclude/asm-$(ARCH) -Iinclude [...]
The problem with that is if you only want to partially override asm/ 
foo.h, and include it from your arch-specific version.  I guess to  
solve that you could also do this:
   include/linux/bar.h
   include/asm-generic/asm/foo.h
   include/asm-powerpc/asm/foo.h
   include/asm-frv/asm/foo.h doesn't exist, defaults to generic version.
And:
   gcc [...] -Iinclude/asm-$(ARCH) -Iinclude/asm-generic -Iinclude [...]
Then you it would be possible to selectively override any headers you  
wanted too.  It also gets rid of that nasty symlink problem.  The  
only remaining trick would be teaching "headers_check" and  
"headers_install" about it.
