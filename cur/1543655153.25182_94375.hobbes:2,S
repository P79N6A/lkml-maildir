Just curious, but how long would it take a system with 8GB RAM, using 4G
or 64G kernel to fall over? One thing I've noticed, is that 2.4.19aa2
runs great on a box with 8GB when I don't allocate all that much, but
seems to run into issues after a large DB has been running on it for
several days. (i.e. the system get's generally a little slower, less
responsive, and in some cases crashes after 7 days). 
Yes, I know, sounds like a memory leak in something, but aside from
patching Oracle from 8.1.7.4(dba's can't find any new patches ATM), I've
tried everything except changing my kernel. 
Could this be similar behaviour?
