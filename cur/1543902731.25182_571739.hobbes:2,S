Thanks, I already fixed my problem. You are right it was serial port
problem. I had wrong MAJOR and MINOR numbers in serial/pxa.c Now kerel boots 
and works fine with -ck patch.
My I ask you if you (compulab) have any plans of merging machine cm-x270 patches
into mainline kernel.
Thanks again,
Rok Markovic
