I am trying to use dev_get_by_index function but having problems
getting my program to link.  The function is located in 
/usr/include/linux/netdevice.h header file.  
Here is what the loader is reporiting to me:
/tmp/cctrJzWu.o(.text+0xc): undefined reference to `dev_get_by_index'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status 
What should I do in order to get my program to link?
Obviously, I am missing a library, but I do not know which one:(
Please, help!!!!
Thanks a lot.
Dmitriy
