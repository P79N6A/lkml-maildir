And then there's programs that store constants as parts of the code,
so that their constant-ness is enforced byt the mmu.
This can be taken further - the compiler can save space by looking
through the generated code and use an address in the code as the
constant if it happens to have the right value.  With some
bad luck it chooses the syscall sequence that it really don't expect 
to be modified.
