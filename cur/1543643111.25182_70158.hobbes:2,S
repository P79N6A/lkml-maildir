My proposal produces the same effect using a slightly different
arrangement: module_cleanup() is called, and the first thing it
does is bail out with an error if there are users, or puts the
module into the inactive state (count=-1).  This forces
try_inc_mod_use_count to fail, as you say.

OK, this is a really good example of why replacing the lock_kernel
with a dedicated module_sem is good: if we do that, the right thing
happens.  Insmod will block on the module_sem until the module is
completely unloaded and removed from the list.  By the time it gets
the semaphore, everything will be in a pristine state.
The BKL on the other hand will happily relinquish control if the
cleanup sleeps, messing things up nicely.

Yes, I don't see a problem.  The problems start when you try to
shortcut this cycle.  Given that a shortcut is hardly going to save
much at all, due to caching, I'd call it a waste of effort.
