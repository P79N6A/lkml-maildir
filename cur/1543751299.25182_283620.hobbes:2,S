sorry for the huge delay since my last post on this, but disabling
low_latency is resulting in dropped characters.
this looks to be exactly what was reported in
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0212.0/0412.html
anything i can do to avoid dropping characters without using
low_latency, which still hangs SMP kernels?
thanks,
tim
