Pavel, can you explain in greater detail exactly what you need?
It sounds like you are running in real mode with code stored at some 
(unknown?) location in memory.  The BIOS calls this code with IP=0 and 
CS=<something>, which apparently doesn't fit your requirements.
So just what are your requirements?  The only possibilities I can think 
of are:
	Code stored at a particular location in memory;
	CS, IP, etc. initialized to some particular values.
What am I missing?
