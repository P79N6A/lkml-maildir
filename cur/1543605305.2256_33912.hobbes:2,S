Subject: how to see manually specified proxy arp entries using "ip neigh"          command?

I (and others) have asked this a couple times here and on the netdev list, and
so far nobody has answered it (not even negatively).
If I manually set some proxy arp entries and then list the arp entries, the
manually set ones do not show up when using "ip neigh" but they do show up with
the "arp" command.
Is there any way to see them using "ip neigh"?  If not, are there any plans to
enable this?
If not, I may have to look at adding support for this, and this is why I'm
wondering.
Thanks,
Chris
