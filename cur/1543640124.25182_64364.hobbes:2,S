i was actually thinking about exactly this scenario when suggesting this.  
The fork()ed child might as well end up being a 'thread' that exits and
thus needs to clear up after itself, right?

in what way is clone() utilized? if it's via any threading library then
the fork()-ed process has its own thread state, which must be freed when
exiting. So it's something like:
	thread X
	fork()		===============>  thread Y
					  clone() ===========>  thread Z
so we at this point have the original thread X, a new thread Y that was
created via the fork(), and thread Z. Thread Y and Z share the same V. If
now thread Y exits:
					   exit()
then we'd sure expect for Z's sake to free Y's thread state, right?  
Otherwise there would be a resource leak.
