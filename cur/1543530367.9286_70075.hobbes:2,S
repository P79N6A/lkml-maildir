I strongly suspect that what I'm about to describe is due either to a flaky
motherboard or a harddrive going bad, as opposed to a kernel or config
issue.  I'm hoping someone here can confirm.  <beg>Andre?</beg>
I've tried researching deja/usenet for answers, but really didn't find
anything that I could piece together.
First, some filtered output from dmesg:

Now some output from hdparm 3.6 (note it gets the 93652U8 wrong, but then
so does fdisk 2.10d, but it *seems* to work, so far):

The motherboard I'm using is a Spacewalker/Shuttle HOT-557 v1.5 with
latest BIOS.  This motherboard is 430VX chipset based and is supposed to
support PIO mode 4/DMA mode 2.  It hangs trying to detect the 93652U8,
so I have it autodetect only hda and let Linux find everything else.
Now, what I'm seeing is a wide variety of performance results (via hdparm
-t), depending on where the harddrives are logically placed.
The following chart will demonstrate, I hope.  I'll list by size.
Config 1:
hda:  2442:  8.43 MB/sec
hdb: 12427: 10.13 MB/sec
hdc: 19470:  6.96 MB/sec
hdd: 34837:  7.49 MB/sec
Config 2:
hda:  2442:  8.43 MB/sec
hdb: 12427: 10.14 MB/sec
hdc: 34837:  8.56 MB/sec
hdd: 19470:  6.69 MB/sec
Config 3:
hda:  2442:  8.43 MB/sec
hdb: 34837:  8.48 MB/sec
hdc: 12427: 10.19 MB/sec
hdd: 19470:  6.72 MB/sec
Config 4:
hda:  2442:  8.43 MB/sec
hdb: 34837:  8.50 MB/sec
hdc: 19470:  6.96 MB/sec
hdd: 12427:  7.49 MB/sec
To be honest, almost no tweaking of hdparm really makes a difference,
except to change PIO modes down to something below 4, which slows things
down, of course.
Also, I'm somewhat regularly getting:
hdd: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide1: reset: success     
Same on hdc.
I've swapped cables, moved power connectors around, etc.  I've seen similar
performance issues before I got the 34837 drive and was using a 3G IBM.  I
figured I'd try all the same brand and see what that did.
If I move the 19470 drive to hdb, all hell breaks loose.  Lots of drive not
ready/seek type errors just doing a "du -s".  Didn't explore other things
too much at that point; I felt I was going to lose my file systems if I
wasn't careful, and I just didn't want to deal with that at this point.
So, is the performance issue I'm seeing with the 19470 drive due to it
getting ready to go out on me?  Is this a piece of crap motherboard (hey, I
got it for free, so no complaints)?
Also, when booting, and it says:
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
With this motherboard and these drives, should I expect to see DMA in there
anywhere instead of pio?  I thought I had all of the correct tuning options
turned on in the kernel.  But since those say BIOS settings, and BIOS
really doesn't even know about the other drives, I'm wouldn't be too
surprised.
Thanks,
mrc
