I thought in the case we were talking about, the problem is that we
have a setuid program which calls mlockall() but then later drops its
privileges.  So when it tries to allocate memories, RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
applies again, and so all future memory allocations would fail.  
What I proposed is a hack, but strictly speaking not necessary
according to the POSIX standards, but the problem is that a portable
program can't be expected to know that Linux has a RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
resource limit, such that a program which calls mlockall() and then
drops privileges will work under Solaris and fail under Linux.  Hence
I why proposed a hack where mlockall() would adjust RLIMIT_MEMLOCK.
Yes, no question it's a hack and a special case; the question is
whether cure or the disease is worse.
