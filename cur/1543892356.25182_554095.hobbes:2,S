Could this also cause a system to be unstable? my abit athlon64 at
work will not run x64 with more than 1gb ram, and i have a colo server
with supermicro & 2 x dual core xeons that will not run with more than
2gb.
Both systems have long uptimes but if i add ram they crash within
minutes of booting.
Tried several kernels up to 2.6.21 and gave up, I can send dmesg
output but the crashes are completely random.
