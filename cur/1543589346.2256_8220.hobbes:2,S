OK. I rebooted the laptop: 
  Linux version 2.2.13 (root@Mandelbrot.suse.de) (gcc version
  egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Mon Nov 8
  15:37:25 CET 1999
which seems to have cleared it. Somehow that directory was still
cached somewhere (not in the buffer cache) from when there were images
on the memory stick.
So, I'm suspecting a dcache bug, that allows something to stay over
after swapping a removable media device.... And all this is irrelevant
as this was on a very old kernel. Sorry to have been wasting your
time.
