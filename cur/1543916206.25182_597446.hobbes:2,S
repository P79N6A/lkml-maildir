Subject: [PATCH 4/6] LBS: fix oops in try_to_release_page

It's uncommon, but try_to_release_page is sometimes called when
page->mapping is NULL (see the check for mapping further down):
so its VM_BUG_ON(mapping_order(mapping)...) just causes an oops.
There seem to be enough of those checks already, and no special
reason to have one right here: just delete it.
