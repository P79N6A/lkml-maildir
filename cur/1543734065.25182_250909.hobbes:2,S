Subject: [rfc][patch] 1/2 Additional cpuset features

Hi,
I'm sending a series of two cpuset-related patches.
I'm not asking for their inclusion in the current kernel.
These are just feature proposals.
Actually, these patches aim to restore the "original" behaviour of the
cpusets, as it was one year from now or so. Since then, to ease the
acceptance of the cpusets, some 'contreversial' features have been
removed.
This first patch adds automatic process migration upon cpuset
modification. Whenever the list of CPUs of a cpuset changes, the kernel
will move tasks so they stay "inside" their cpuset.
Applies against 2.6.9-rc1-mm4.
