That wasn't what I meant, yes, that is true in the current kernel. 
However, any device which would start generating interrupts just because 
  its BARs got enabled by pci_enable_device seems broken.
The driver needs to request the interrupt after the device is enabled, 
and only after that can it enable the device to generate interrupts.
