I've shared your frustration this summer:

but after 2.6.8.1 and going back to 8K stacks, my fileserver has been
stable.

Have you tried if this helps:
	sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=10000
Fixed oom-killer problems for me on 2.6.8-rc2. It was very eager to
kill the backup (tivoli storage manager) client.  Haven't needed it so
far on 2.6.8.1.

Dual pentium-III (IBM x330)
2 TB Infortren Eonstore, fibre channel
500 GB in use
~5 M files
Also have another dual Xeon (Dell PowerEdge 2650) with ~1 TB on XFS,
but that's running 2.4.20-30.8.XFS1.3.1smp, and has never had any
problems.

My impression so far has been more that the 2.6-series might not yet
have been stable enough. Have had to be chasing the leading/bleeding
edge to get away from the known problems.  Was looking forward to a
real "maintainer" taking over this series, but that doesn't seem to be
happening..
