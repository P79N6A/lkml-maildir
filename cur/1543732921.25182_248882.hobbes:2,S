If the non-computer literate user is expected to edit the config file,
a pretty interface that hides the internals from the user should be provided.
For the sake of power users, users that believe themselves to be power users,
and configuration changes on multiple systems.
1) Track the location of the config file with the native package management
system.
2) Keep a human readable/editable format.
3) Provide APIs or schema so that the files may be parsed for correctness,
or edited or created programatically.
4) Provide a tool that not only checks for a parseable file, but does
sanity checks such as (Does file exist).
I'm at a loss as to how any of this has anything to do with filesystems.
The closest I see is one implementation of the above (gconf2) happens to
use the filesystem for it's default hierarchical database backend.
As for developers that are too stupid/lazy to provide the GUI and meet
the other criteria...  I suggest extensive use of cattle prods on
them as they attend an automata class.
