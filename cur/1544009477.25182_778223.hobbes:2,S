Sigh, it does indeed look messy...

I think that's a really bad idea, since it basically just clears the
'rq'. If you have that rq on some list (timeout, for instance), the
kernel will not be happy. I think we have to, for now at least, put and
get a request before looping. Then for 2.6.29 we can hopefully improve
this situation!
