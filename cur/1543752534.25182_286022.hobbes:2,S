1) See kernel/module.c:1156 ("/* OK if weak. */").
2) Weak undefined symbols should "just work".  Overriding of weak
defined symbols is not implemented: noone has asked.
3) Like any statically-resolved symbol, this module will hold a
reference to the module exporting the symbol.  The only special thing
about weak symbols is that we don't fail to load if they are unresolved
(and the address will be NULL in this case).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
