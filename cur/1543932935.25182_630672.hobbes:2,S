True, but the problem still happenens today, if we switch back to 64K
iommu page size (which should be possible, I need to fix that), we
-will- run out of iommu space on typical workloads and that is not
acceptable.
So we need to find a compromise.
What I might do is something around the lines of: If size >= PAGE_SIZE,
and vaddr (page_address + offset) is PAGE_SIZE aligned, then I enforce
alignment of the resulting mapping.
That should fix your case. Anything requesting smaller than PAGE_SIZE
mappings would lose that alignment but I -think- it should be safe, and
you still always get 4K alignment anyway (+/- your offset) so at least
small alignment restrictions are still enforced (such as cache line
alignment etc...).
I'll send you a test patch later today.
Ben.
