Aha, thanks for clearing that up. I agree it is not important to have
the boot GDT aligned, but I think it is preferable to make parts of the
two versions of setup.S equal if possible.
Let's see what Steven Rostedt comes up with.
I find the relocatable image patches interesting. I wonder if one can
get such a kernel 'running' using bochs, freedos, and loadlin ;).
