	See RFC 793 p. 66 (in the original pagination).  ACK packets
are allowed in SYN-SENT state; what this means is:
1)	Your socket is created.
2)	It sends a SYN packet to itself, and enters SYN-SENT.
3)	It receives the SYN from itself and sends a SYN/ACK.
4)	It receives the SYN/ACK and enters SYN-RECEIVED.
	Nifty, huh?  Why would anyone want to use it?  Well, it's
really just a byproduct of supoporting simultaneous creation of a
single connection between peers.  Here's one scenario:
1)	Imagine a process that uses a single local port for both
	listening and for opening outgoing connections.  This is
	legal TCP, and minimizes the number of ports used (FIN-WAIT
	may bit you, though).
2)	Now a community of these processes communicating among themselves,
	tearing down connections after each exchange between a pair of
	processes.  Normally, an initiating process talks to the
	other processes' LISTEN connection.
3)	Now imagine that two of these processes tried to talk to each
	other at the same time.  They'd each build a connection control
	block identifying the pair of sockets, but they'll receive a
	plain SYN instead of a SYN/ACK as the first packet from the
	remote site.
