FWIW,
I'm currently using the 'unpatched' version of PPP 2.3.5 on RHL with Kernel
2.0.36-3, and so far it is working fine.
I have seen numerous references to a "small bug in PPPD 2.3.5, however I have
not encountered any problems myself.
Would you mind bringing me 'up to speed' on the problem with 2.3.5?
