Yes they do. 604 has two counters, 604e has four.

I seem to recall hearing something about some temperature
monitoring interrupt interacting badly with the performance
monitor interupt due to an errata, but that may not have been
the 750.

They're not supposed to interact, but there is currently no
mechanism in place for preventing both from being activated
at the same time. What's needed is some form of kernel API
for reserving and releasing the performance counter hardware,
and updating oprofile to use that API.
