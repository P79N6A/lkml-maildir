Despite this circumstantial evidence, I don't see how my patch could
possible have an effect here....
Looking at the code, starting at _cpu_down in the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
case, the call notifier chain 'cpu_chain' contains
workqueue_cpu_callback which does 'mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex)' in
the "DOWN_PREPARE" case and mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex) in the
DOWN_FAILED and DEAD cases.
blocking_notifier_call_chain is
	down_read(&nh->rwsem);
	ret = notifier_call_chain(&nh->head, val, v);
	up_read(&nh->rwsem);
and so holds ->rwsem while calling the callback.
So the locking sequence ends up as:
 down_read(&cpu_chain.rwsem);
 mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex);
 up_read(&cpu_chain.rwsem);
 down_read(&cpu_chain.rwsem);
 mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex);
 up_read(&workqueue_mutex);
and lockdep doesn't seem to like this.  It sees workqueue_mutex
claimed while cpu_chain.rwsem is held. and then it sees
cpu_chain.rwsem claimed while workqueue_mutex is held, which looks a
bit like a class ABBA deadlock.
Of course because it is a 'down_read' rather than a 'down', it isn't
really a dead lock.
I don't know how to tell lockdep to do the right thing, but I'll leave
that up to Ingo et al.
Why it didn't trigger without my patch I cannot imagine.  Are you sure
the config was identical (you didn't remove CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU or
anything did you?).
