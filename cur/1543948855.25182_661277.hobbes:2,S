Try 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~romieu/r8169/2.6.16/stable-46/to-2.6.24/
It contains a patch for the r8169 driver which should apply to your
2.6.16.46 based kernel and turn its r8169 driver into something closer
to 2.6.24. The kit contains a stack of incremental patches too if you
are curious.
I have fixed some rejects, checked that everything compiles at each
step but the patch is otherwise untested. Use at your own risk.
