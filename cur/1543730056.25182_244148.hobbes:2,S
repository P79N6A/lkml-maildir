This is while running the stress-kernel suite. I don't know about it
being a false possitive, it very well may be. Looking back through the
logs though I am not sure this is a valid latency anyway. This trace was
from 06:37 this morning. About 19:54 last night I got an oops in kswapd
and this morning around 10:30ish I had stuff getting killed right and
left by oom. So, I am thinking that this probably is not a very reliable
test.
