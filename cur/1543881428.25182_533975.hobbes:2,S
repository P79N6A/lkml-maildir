Sure, but Hans wants to change /etc/inetd.conf into /etc/inetd.conf.d,
where you have: /etc/inetd.conf.d/telnet/port,
/etc/inetd.conf.d/telnet/protocol, /etc/inetd.conf.d/telnet/wait,
/etc/inetd.conf.d/telnet/userid, /etc/inetd.conf.d/telnet/daemon,
etc. for each individual line in /etc/inetd.conf.  (And where each
file might only contains 2-4 characters each: i.e., "23", "tcp",
"root", etc.)
So it's not enough just to collapse open/pread/close into a single
system call; in order to gain back the performance squandered by all
of these itsy-bitsy tiny little files.  You want to collapse the
open/pread/close for many of these little files into a single system
call, hence Hans's insistence on sys_reiser4(); otherwise his scheme
doesn't work all that well at all.
