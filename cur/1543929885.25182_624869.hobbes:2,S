Hello. Geoff-san. Sorry for late response.
Could you tell me the value of the following page_size calculation
in vmemmap_populate()? I think this page_size may be too big value. 
------
int __meminit vmemmap_populate(struct page *start_page,
                                       unsigned long nr_pages, int node)
                           :
                           :
        unsigned long page_size = 1 << mmu_psize_defs[mmu_linear_psize].shift;
                           :
-------
In addition, I remember that current add_memory() is designed for
only 1 section's addition. (See: memory_probe_store() and
sparse_mem_map_populate().
they require only for 1 section's mem_map by specifing
PAGES_PER_SECTION.)
The 1 section size for normal powerpc box is only 16MB.
(IA64 -> 1GB, x86-64 -> 128MB).
But, if my understanding is correct, PS3's add_memory() requires all
of total memory. I'm afraid something other problems might be hidden
in this issue yet.
(However, I think Milton-san's suggestion is very desirable. 
 If preallocation of hotadd works on ia64 too, I'm very glad.)
Thanks.
