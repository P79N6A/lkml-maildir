Perhaps in the case where the console is on a vt, kdb could try to
switch to the right vc before presenting its prompt?  I realize calling into
the vc code might be risky but it seems like there's not much to lose.  
(If you do have a bug in say the agp driver then you need a serial
console...)   If it works, you'll be able to debug and continue.
It could even set the colors to white on blue. :-)
