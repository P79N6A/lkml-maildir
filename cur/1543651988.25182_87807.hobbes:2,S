"After an NMI interrupt is recognized by the P6 family, Pentium, Intel486, 
Intel386, and Intel 286 processors, the NMI interrupt is masked until the 
first IRET instruction is executed, unlike the 8086 processor."

You don't have to worry about protection in the handler, just make sure 
external references (non NMI) mask that handler. Alternatively you can do 
a spin_trylock if you really need to and consider it a lost NMI if you 
can't acquire.
