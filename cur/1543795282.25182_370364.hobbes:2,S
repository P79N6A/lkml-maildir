Ok, this is interesting... 'status: 1'.
That should be either 0 or a negative errno.
That is printed in bitmap_init_from_disk in drivers/md/bitmap.c
'ret' can only be '1' if that value is returned from 'write_page'
write_page (same file) can only return '1' if that is returned by
write_one_page (mm/page-writeback.c).
write_one_page can only return '1' from a_ops->writepage, which is
presumably
  reiser4_writepage in fs/reiser4/page_cache.c
This will only return an unchecked value from write_page_by_ent (if
REISER4_USE_ENTD is defined) or emergency_flush.
emergency_flush is in fs/reiser4/emergency_flush.c and it does indeed
return 1 in some circumstances, though I don't really know what
circumstances.
So there may well be something that md/bitmap is doing wrongly, but
reiser4_writepage should not be returning 1 in any case.
Could someone on reiserfs-dev help me understand when
reiser4_writepage returns '1' and what I might be doing to trigger
that?
Thanks,
NeilBrown
