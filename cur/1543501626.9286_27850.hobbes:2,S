I personally don't see why kernel bloat is not minimized, by
removing all the proc filesystem code, and doing everything in
minimalistic syscalls.  Backwards compatibility could be kept
with modules, or another library, or something.  Script writers
could use the backward compatible route without changing one line
of code, and new script writers could use the new library
interface that would be created by this...
I'm surprised that Linux has the /proc tree in kernel, however
I'm not an expert at this sort of thing, so perhaps I'm
overlooking reasons why it can't be done mostly in userland with
minimalistic syscalls.
