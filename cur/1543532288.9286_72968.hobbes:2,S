Subject: Pre3: NFS Client can't "touch" read-only served file.

In linux-2.3.99-pre3 I noticed that a remote NFS client (running an
older stable version of Linux) can't change the times of a file
(e.g. "touch") on a server running pre3 that's marked read-only
(0444).
This maybe user error, but could someone else try this.  To verify
or denied this problem?
	Thanks,
