Either your distributions setup is broken and overwrites
/usr/include/scsi/scsi.h (check whether it has the FSF copyright,
they took the kernel header verbatim and just slapped their copyright
boilerplate over it..) or cdrtools is broken enough to explicitly
add the kernel source to it's include dirs.  Both would need fixing,
the first is easy, the second needs conviencing Joerg which might
become difficult :)
