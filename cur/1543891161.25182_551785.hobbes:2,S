Thanks for clarifying this, Pavel.
If you come upon an XE3 where Linux-2.6.22 doesn't work as well
as Windows, please let me know.
Given that the justification for this ill-conceived workaround
seems to have diminished to the memory of broken hardware,
it is clear that we should stay the course of removing it
so that it doesn't further confuse future users.
If SuSE violently disagrees with me, you are certainly empowered
to restore the workaround in your distribution staring at 2.6.22
as part of your value add.  However, given its history of confusing
users, it seems that it might increase your support burden rather
than decrease it.
