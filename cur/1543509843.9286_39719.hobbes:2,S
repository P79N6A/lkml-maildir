Pete, and Andrey,
Good catch!  Yup, that's definitely a problem.  I have no idea how we've
gone so long without anyone catching this, since the problem exists in
the 2.2 kernels as well.
Alan, here's a patch for the 2.3-ac patches.  It includes another
workaround to deal with the problem that the IRDA drivers are calling
get_random_bytes before the random driver is initialized, and this
causes kernel panic.  We still need to fix the ordering problem (or IRDA
needs to defer its call to get_random_bytes), but at least this way the
kernel won't crash.  The IRDA driver will *not* be getting a random
number for its services, so we do need to fix this before 2.4.  But
adding a failsafe to get_random_bytes() is a good idea anyway....
