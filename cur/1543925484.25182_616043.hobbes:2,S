Okay, I've got some updates that I'm going to send out now to the PCI 
virtio driver but I'll also change it to switch over to a memory 
layout.  It's not the best PCI ABI but I can certainly live with it.

If we're treating the PCI config space as an opaque memory blob, instead 
of as distinct registers, I think it makes more sense to just put it in 
memory.  In the backend, I have to treat it as a memory blob anyway and 
using the PCI config space just means that I have to write all the 
various PIO handlers for the different access sizes.  It's much more 
elegant in my mind just to have the driver provide some memory that the 
host fills out.
Thanks for all the review,
