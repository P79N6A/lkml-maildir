Clueless ?  Hardly. Every other appliance in the home you turn it off and it
goes off. You turn it on and it comes on. You get confused you turn it off and
on. Its the definitive model of how home appliances works and its how people
expect them to work.
In the embedded world you will regularly see adherence to that model in 
the specification. Firstly because the users do it, secondly because power
cuts ensure it happens anyway
