 oh - sorry for that. here's the normal state of things (well almost, the
 processes are in the R state most of the time). however as i wrote before,
 when those processes get over ~900mb, kswapd starts paging with ~50+% cpu
 usage. i lived under the impression memory shown in SHARE column is
 'shared' so the processes summed up could actually be bigger than
 physical memory (like 6x 1.5gb SIZE, 1.49gb RSS, 1.49gb SHARE for a 4gb
 machine). am i living in the dark?
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND

 also, ipcs claims there's 812593152 bytes (yes, that's 774mb, when i
 configure the engines to eat more memory ipcs shows for example 1+gb of
 shared memory allocated). how can this be possible? overcommit_memory is
 set to 0.
    thank you for your help in advance,
