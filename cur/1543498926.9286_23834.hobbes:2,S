Why.............the web page that you found that patch on is running 
Mar  5 21:18 /src/linux-2.0.37pre8+pat4/vmlinux
The only reason a new version is not running is that I have not had time
to touch that system.  I realy can not keep up with 4 or 5 source trees
for the IDE code.
2.0.36
2.0.37-1-pre-patch
2.2.9
2.2.10-3-pre-patch
2.3.7-1-pre-patch (possible)
