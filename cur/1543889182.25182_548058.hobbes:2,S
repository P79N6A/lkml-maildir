thanks for the fixes - they look all good and we'll check it in -rt. 
We'll try to find a solution for the remaining problem too. Could your
#2 crash be explained via any of the bugs you fixed? (i.e. memory
corruption?) I'd exclude genuine rtmutex.c breakage for now because 
that's the basis of all locking in -rt - but maybe the futex interfacing 
upsets something ...
