This does not solve the problem of drivers which do not have matching
hardware, like PPP and loop device. I do not mind unconditionally loading
these modules at boot, but there has to be a way to recognize them: I do
not think it is acceptable to load *all* modules available on the system
(what is the point of having a modular kernel then?).
