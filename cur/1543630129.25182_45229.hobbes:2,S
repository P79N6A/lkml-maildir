It will need decent testing + backport of knfsd changes to 2.4 to become
a candidate for merge.
As for the binary compatibility... as long as we are source-compatible
(i.e. keep ->read_inode2 and provide a compatible iget4()) - compatibility
is not a problem.  Anyone who ships binary-only modules is playing in the
traffic and if they become a roadkill - it's Not Our Problem(tm).  Think
of it as evolution in action...
