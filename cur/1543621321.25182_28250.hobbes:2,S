Okay, I'm running on the system, isn't that how you tell fatal errors, by
booting the kernel?
This came out of "make dep" and I'm not sure what it's telling me.
Tree is 2.4.18-pre9-ac3 with the ksyms.c patch, tried "make distclean"
pulling a 2.4.17 config and "make oldconfig" and still got this.
Not concerned, just curious.
After I run benchmarks on this last kernel I'm going to post some results
and comments on kernels for small and slow machines.
