This had me thorougly confused for a while ;) The __user tag here should
apply to grouplist, not to info.

+{

Why are many functions playing with TASK_SIZE?

rant.  We have soooo many syscalls declared in .c files.  We had a bug due
to this a while back.  Problem is, we have no anointed header in which to
place them.  include/linux/syscalls.h would suit.  And unistd.h for
arch-specific syscalls.  But that's not appropriate to this patch.
