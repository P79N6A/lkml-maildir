I must have been smoking something when I convinced myself that the driver 
can't call into the kernel without switching back to the kernel stack.  But 
this is wrong, as long as ->task and ->previous_esp are initialized, staying 
on the bigger stack looks fine (previous_esp is apparently used only for 
backtrace).

Yes, just like do_IRQ.

There is no mutex now, but this is the easy way to get by with just one ndis 
stack.

We have preempt_enable/disable for that.  But I am not sure preemption needs 
to be disabled.
