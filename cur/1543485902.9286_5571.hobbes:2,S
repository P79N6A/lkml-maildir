Yes.

Ugh.
I'd much rather just always add it to the "inode dirty list". List
maintenance is essentially zero overhead if you use the nice list macros
in <linux/list.h> (as opposed to the braindamaged BSD compatibility macros
in <linux/lists.h>), and it's fairly trivial to just keep each dirty block
on two dirty lists (one inode-specific, one global - you'd still use the
global one for normal write-outs). 
It's just a few pointer operations, and the advantage of having a clean
and simple design probably results in better performance anyway.
