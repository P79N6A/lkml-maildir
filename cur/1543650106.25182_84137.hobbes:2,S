Except that people have a lot of inodes in their slab caches...  It's not
so much the processing overhead as the extra memory.  struct inode is
bloated enough without adding more into it that isn't necessarily useful
for some people (people who don't have lots of RAM, or don't use any
filesystems which support the higher resolution, or are slow enough that
compiles don't have problems, or don't compile at all)...
Cheers, Andreas
