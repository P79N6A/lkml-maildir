In 2.6.12-rc5-mm1, I can't use my psaux mouse, but it worked perfectly 
fine in both 2.6.12-rc5 and in 2.6.12-rc4-mm2.
In 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 , dmesg says:
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:PS2K,PNP0f13:PS2M] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
Failed to disable AUX port, but continuing anyway... Is this a SiS?
If AUX port is really absent please use the 'i8042.noaux' option.
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
This is what dmesg says in both 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 and 2.6.12-rc5 :
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:PS2K,PNP0f13:PS2M] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
I am using a Shuttle FT61 motherboard.  Is there any more information 
necessary to debug this?
