I can see both sides of the argument - consider your video - users can
switch that off without thinking; but really its off switch is soft and
actually unloads the tape from the heads first before switching off.
Having said that look at something like test equipments; you can just pull
the power on them - I don't think large scopes/logic analysers with discs
in have anything clever hardware wise to to a careful switch off.
(Some of these are running Win98 and some HP-UX these days with
journalling stuff in).
