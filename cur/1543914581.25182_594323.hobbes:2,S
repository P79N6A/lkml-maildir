Hi,
To eliminate the possibility of this being a hardware issue, I have now 
acquired another "Gigabyte GA-N650SLI-DS4" motherboard (with the "MCP51" 
chipset) for testing. I'll swap parts this evening. Hopefully I'll be 
able to tell you in a few hours whether this appears to be working as it 
should. The motherboard that I'm going to swap to has actually been 
tested (with MS Windows OS+driver) for more than a day with a disk 
connected, so if this MB also fails, I think it will be safe to say that 
the issue is with the sata_nv driver... So hang on.
(You can't think of something else that could conflict with the sata_nv 
driver after a bit of time, like two of my raid-disks being encrypted, 
me running a SW raid-5 array / some special HW (quad-core CPU) / me 
running vmware on this server ... ? - To me, all these suggestions seems 
rather far fetched, especially as all is working with another 
controller, so I'm arguing that unless there's a HW issue, the issue is 
with the driver, but you're the expert(s), so let me know if you differ.)
I'll keep you posted as to the result of swapping HW.. Give me a few 
hours.  :-)
