ok. Found the error.
bttv-0.7.103 and earlier (kernel 2.4.20 and earlier) had the following
lines in two places:
  mt2032_set_if_freq(c,freq* 1000*1000/16, ...
When freq is defined as int, this computation causes a sign extension
error when freq is 2244 (140.25MHz). The error disappears if
1000*1000/16 is replaced with 62500 and/or if freq is defined as
unsigned int.
Here is a simple test to surface this error:
// test with gcc -o signext signext.c && ./signext
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int s; unsigned f;
	s = 2244; f = s;
	printf("freq=%d rfin=%d\n", s*62500, s*1000*1000/16);
	printf("freq=%d rfin=%d\n", f*62500, f*1000*1000/16);
}
the output shows:
freq=14025000 rfin=-128185456
freq=14025000 rfin=140250000
bttv-0.7.104+ and kernel 2.4.21+ have the fix. Still, I thought of
recording the error for those still on older kernels.
