There are no -pre's in 2.6, at least not till now.

2.6.z.w is already "reserved" for another kind of updates. You're proposing a
system where you have:
2.6.10
2.6.10-???1
2.6.10-???2
2.6.10-???3
2.6.11-rc1
2.6.11-rc2
2.6.11-rc3
2.6.11
...
Or, in other words, you don't want Linus to "Stop doing the pre's", you're
wanting exactly the same scheme 2.4 is using and works preety fine: just
replace 10 by 11 in the '???' series, replace '???' by 'pre' and you have:
x.y.z
x.y.z+1-pre1
...
x.y.z+1-preN
x.y.z+1-rc1
2.4 model allways worked fine, we should stick with it instead of pulling our
hair out trying to figure out how to solve the problem that is already solved.
