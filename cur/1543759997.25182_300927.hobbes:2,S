Here is a problem with 2.6.10:
while read file; do mplayer $file ; done <mediafiles.txt
or
tail -n93  mediafiles.txt | while read file; do mplayer $file ; done
for each file path in that text file I get:
Failed to open /dev/rtc: Permission denied (it should be readable by the user.)
In addition the audio pcm level is set to zero (presumably by mplayer).
This does work:
for file in `cat mediafiles.txt`; do mplayer $file ; done
but discovering and fixing code now broke will be unpleasent.
What exactly is going on?
