    I really don't know, but from microsoft technical information
(the first or second hit when googling for "FAT32 size limit"), the
limit they specify in FAT32 is 2^32-1.
    I may be wrong, but with 32 bits you cannot address more than
2^32 bytes, I don't know how can you create a bigger-than-4Gb file in
a FAT32 filesystem without resorting to tricks like this:
    forum.doom9.org/archive/index.php/t-20689.html
    Looks like FAT-32 (don't ask me how because I don't know the
internals) can store a file bigger than 4GB, but you cannot *save*
it. So you won't be able to put the file you have back to any FAT32
filesystem, I'm afraid.

    No, I don't have any idea about how to do it, sorry :(

    I doubt. That limit is a hard limit as far as I know. Google for
"FAT32 limit" and you'll get a lot of answers telling it. I don't
really know how did you get a bigger than 4GB file saved in a FAT32
filesystem in the first place ;))
