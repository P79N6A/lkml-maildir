Okay.  I guess this limits portable volatile to main memory.  Thanks for

Indeed, I see no other way now.

Volatile is useful for non device driver work, for example VJ-style 
channels.  A portable volatile can help to code such things in a 
compiler-neutral and platform-neutral way.  Linux doesn't care about 
compiler neutrality, being coded in GNU C, and about platform 
neutrality, having a per-arch abstraction layer, but other programs may 
wish to run on multiple compilers and multiple platforms without 
per-platform glue layers.
Adding barriers to volatile can take it from dangerously useless to 
somewhat* useful.  Not for Linux, but other projects do exist.
* possibly barriers are still required, if volatile data points to 
non-volatile data.
