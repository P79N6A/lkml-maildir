Hi,
when I want to use an external function/data in my LKM, say I want to use
cpuid from processor.h, I include processor.h in my KLM, and call cpuid.
It compiles fine, but when I try to insmod it, I get unresolved symbol
cpuid.
This happens quite often when I try to use something from outside. I've
read i386_ksyms.c doesn't export those symbols and this causes the problem
when insmod tries to link them.
I am wondering if there is a way around this unresolved symbol problem, or
if I get something wrong.
thanks...
