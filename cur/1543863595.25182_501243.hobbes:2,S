please read what i wrote: in the first section above i am talking about 
Thomas' -hrt tree and its track record. Thomas' tree is more than a year 
old and has an excellent track record. In the last sentence i was 
talking about this latest iteration of his -hrt tree, which i released 
as part of -rt yesterday. (but which i have tested internally longer 
than that, prior release.)

Thomas' -hrt tree has been in -rt for over a year.

isnt your test config ARM? If it's x86 or x86_64 then please send me a 
bugreport about it. rt10 wont compile on non-i686 and non-x86_64 because 
their clockevents drivers have not been updated yet (but should be 
trivial). In any case, this is an -rt internal matter that has no 
relevance on the -mm submission, i'm not sure why you are bringing it 
up.
the -mm queue Thomas sent is for i686 - other architectures wont use 
clockevents and they are expected to build and boot just fine.

in the -rt tree i'm tracking the high-res code that has been started by 
Thomas in mid-2005. In the past 1.5 years, 90%+ of the bugfixes to 
high-res timers issues in -rt came from Thomas and this has been about 
the 10th major iteration to his codebase. If you have cleanups to his 
code then please work with Thomas to get your changes into his tree.
