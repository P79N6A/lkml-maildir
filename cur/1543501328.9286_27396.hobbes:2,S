No.  You're right that the apps need a well designed interface 
to work with.  However, that interface needs to be a C library.
Apps on linux never get to talk directly to the kernel -- they 
talk to C libraries which translate things appropriately for 
the kernel.
And, as people have stated (repeatedly): for portability you need to
have a portable implementation of the library.  It's fine to have an
optimized version that talks to some special linux feature, but that
*must* be recognized as an optimization.
Finally, I've seen people object to the use of directories because apps
might create names with /../ in them.  However, this is trivial to work
around by altering the name from the app before passing it to the kernel
(use a prefix character, or some out-of-band escape character, or any
of a variety of other schemes).
[I've also seen objections of the form: what if some random app mucks
with the internal structure of a document-represented-as-a-directory.
But again, this is trivial to deal with: mark the document components
read-only.  Your "Real users" coming through your high level interface
(that supports this document structure) aren't likely to even notice, but
if they do somehow get to the command line or some alternative interface
they'll still get permission denied if they try to mutilate a document.]
