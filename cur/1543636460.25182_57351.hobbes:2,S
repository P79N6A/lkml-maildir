Okay, other than the overhead and having enough filespace for Tbkup sec
(min, hr, day) of operation this is practical. In general most times you
would be doing an incremental, and the time would not be much.

Obviously a small f/s is one you can backup without operator intervantion
to change media and in a reasonable time, which might be 10min..few hours
depending on your taste. That's kind of my rule of thumb, you're welcome
to suggest others, but if someone has to change media I can't call it
small any more.

With some people, pray or ignore the problem are popular.
