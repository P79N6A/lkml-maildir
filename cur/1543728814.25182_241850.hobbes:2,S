voluntary_resched() was probably called as part of the might_sleep_if()
done in mm/slab.c. If you have CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP enabled then
the kernel should have complained about 'Debug: sleeping function ...'.
but what i think happened here is that reiserfs still uses
lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel() quite alot (eg. ext3 or xfs doesnt), which
from a preemptability POV is just as much of a critical section as a
spinlock, but processes can sleep (the scheduler auto-releases and
auto-reacquires the big kernel lock).
