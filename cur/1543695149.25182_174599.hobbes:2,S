My understanding is that we are suspending the box (ie: putting your
laptop to sleep/hybernate), so for all practical purposes the box is off
waiting until it is woken up. During that time I don't believe we
receive timer interrupts. When we are woken up, we should update the
system time and continue, but as the box wasn't running during the
interim we shouldn't be increasing the notion of monotonic time.

Hmmm. That last sentence gives me pause. I guess it comes down to how
you request your timer expiration: in wall time or system time.  I
always thought it was in system time, but you know this stuff better
then I, so I'll defer.
Pavel: You new patch looks ok wrt the locking issue. I'm still pretty
suspicious of the clock_cmos_diff but I'll trust you that it does the
right thing (this has been tested, right? :)
thanks
