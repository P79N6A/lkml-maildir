It's going down, either by netdev->stop() or by hot-unplug, in every
place I used the netif_msg_ifdown() filter.

Again, if that's going to become an official guideline it ought to be
documented in Documentation/netif-msg.txt ... along with information
about how to handle categorization of debug messages.
I suspect a general "how to use debug messages" document would help too.
With guidance like "fault paths should have diagnostics that let you
distinguish each fault", and "never provide success messages at default
message logging levels".  (Log spamming ... we hates it forever!)
If it's wrong to use netif_msg_if{up,down} for debug messages (which go
away when DEBUG isn't defined, and yes are intended for debugging aids)
which are related to interfaces going up and down ... then what's the
"correct" category to filter those out?

It's not coupled to a packet TX or RX, so the guidelines I've seen
suggest netif_msg_{tx,rx}_err() would be wrong.  Maybe KERN_ERR with
no filter would be right ... but I'm used to having one goal of all
message filtering as being able to _completely shut up_ the component.
That's why there's a filter ... deverr() does wrap KERN_ERR.
