Accurancy here has 2 meanings.
1) From data update point of view. The data is correct because only the
process itself updates them and there is no nested update.
2) If the reader could get the correct data when the process updates the data. It
might be an issue. But the issue is not important. Mostly, the application tool
reads the data in an interval.
