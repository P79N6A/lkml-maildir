then it will break on archs with more ram than 1<<(32+PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT).
Also there must be some significant memory overhead that can be
triggered with a certain layout of pages, in some configuration it
should take much more ram than the hashtable if I understood well how it
works.
Also its O(1) may be slower than the O(N) of the hashtable in the 99% of
the cases.

the scalability cost I obviously agree :) (however on some workload with
all tasks on the same inode, the scalability cost remains the same).
