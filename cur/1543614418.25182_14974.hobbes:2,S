no just using it normally, copying files from the old to the new drive,
running apt-get dist-upgrade etc., and then, some files contain garbage.
only on reiserfs partitions (i copied about 3gb reiserfs to reiserfs and
about 15gb fat32 to fat32, both under linux), and seemingly random... as i
said, the file system looks good (right filesize etc.), the files just
contain garbage. so i think the contents of the files gets corrupted, and
not the file system entries for them. as for the reason why, i have no idea
(obviously).
bye & merry christmas
