i think this is true only if the kernel comes with capabilities
enabled.
various media-centric distributions (CCRMA, demudi, dyne:bolic and
others) enabled them for their 2.4 kernels, but not the major
desktop-centric ones. then the impression began to be received that in
2.6, capabilities were even more questionable of a mechanism to use.
In addition, the LSM system appeared, and seemed to offer a much
better solution entirely: no need to patch the kernel at all, or at
least it appeared to be so in the beginning. Hence the "realtime" LSM.
