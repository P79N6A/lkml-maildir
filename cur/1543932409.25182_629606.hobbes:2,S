Yes, that is correct.  In-flight DMA writes from the device to system
memory can pass each other, so that the CPU sees a "complete" status
in the completion queue before the operation in question has actually
finished updating CPU memory.

Write access from the device.  The idea is to set the flag on the
completion queue, so that when the device writes the "complete" status
for the operation, all DMAs associated with that operation are flushed
first.
