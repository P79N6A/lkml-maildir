Nick,
We're working to slowly get the new DRM memory manager into the 
mainstream kernel.
This means we have a need for the page fault handler patch you wrote 
some time ago.
I guess we could take the no_pfn() route, but that would need a check 
for racing
unmap_mapping_range(), and other problems may arise.
What is the current status and plans for inclusion of the fault() code?
Thanks,
Thomas Hellstrom
