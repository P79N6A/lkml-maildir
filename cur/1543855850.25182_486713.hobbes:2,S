Ah, sorry for confusion, I talked only about read lock/unlock of course.
Just in case, it is not safe to do srcu_read_{,un}lock() from irq,
	per_cpu_ptr(sp->per_cpu_ref, smp_processor_id())->c[idx]++
	                                                  ^^^^^^^^
we need local_t for that.

Yes, exactly! There is another reason, suppose we did
	qp->completed++;
	atomic_inc(qp->ctr + (idx ^ 0x1));
In that case the reader could be stalled if synchronize_qrcu() takes a
preemption in between.

Surely.
