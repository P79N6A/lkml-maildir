Yup.  There seems to have been some progress in this regard in the
linux1394 mailing lists and SVN repository, but it's still a bit
unstable.
Personally, I've been using the 2.6.3 ieee1394 sources in newer kernel
releases, and it's been working very well.  Perhaps we should revert
drivers/ieee1394 to the 2.6.3 state until the problems are addressed
in the linux1394 repository, to only then have it merged here.
What we have now was a merge of a non-functional state of the tree,
which servers nobody.
I can easily provide a patch to restore the working state, if people
think this would be a good idea.  Just say the word.
