I am slowly trying to reduce the uses of "bufferhead"s in the ext3.
We can get away not attaching a bufferheads for the pages in
ext3 writeback mode easily. But for ordered mode, its doable
but tricky.
There are few cases, I didn't handle in my patch (just to reduce
the code complexity)
	- I still create bufferheads for filesystem 
	blocksize != PAGE_SIZE
	- In case of a truncate and the page is not uptodate
	(needs to do IO to read the page) - I attach buffers.
	I had code to eliminate this - but Andrew didn't like it :(
I want to get more run-time before making it a default.
Thanks,
Badari
