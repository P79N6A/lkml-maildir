We don't want user-space programs to have control over priority.  This 
is DoS waiting to happen.

This is much too specific.  Again, if the USER has control over this 
list, then it's potential DoS.  And if the user adds a program which 
should qualify but which is not in the list, the program will not get 
its deserved boost.
And a sysadmin is not going to want to update 200 lab computers just so 
one user can get their program to run properly.

They are doable, but they are not a general solution.
