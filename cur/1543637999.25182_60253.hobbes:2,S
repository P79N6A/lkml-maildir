The world of tcp synflooding changed how stacks handle this sort of
stuff forever. Welcome to the new world order 8)
You will get connections completing, they will time out. If you expect
the server to say something you'll see the timeout there instead of
seeing it on the connect. 
Since a timeout on the data can happen in the real world Im sure your
code already correctly handles this case ;)
