Subject: [PATCH] Allow LBD on architectures that support it
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While researching the as-iosched division last night (sorry, I slept
and went to work before sending out the patch), I noticed CONFIG_LBD
wasn't in my config file.  The following architectures appear to have
the necessary asm/types.h changes:
include/asm-i386/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
include/asm-mips/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
include/asm-ppc/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
include/asm-s390/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
include/asm-sh/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
include/asm-x86_64/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
Choosing the 32 bit versions of those I selected
X86 MIPS32 PPC32 ARCH_S390_31 SUPERH
(Yes, X86_64 wouldn't need it except for defining X86.  PARISC and SPARC
might want it, not sure about m68k and the other 32 bit architectures.
For that matter, I wonder what SuperH platform will use it.  This patch
just shows what has been merged).
