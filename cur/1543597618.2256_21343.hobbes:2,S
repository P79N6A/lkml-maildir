Is the capacity of your MO disk more than 640M?
In order to clarify a problem, please send the debugging output of FAT.
---------------------- start example --------------------------------
 $ mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mnt -o debug
 $ dmesg | tail
  Type:   Optical Device                     ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 5, lun 0
sym53c875-0-<5,*>: asynchronous.
SCSI device sda: 310352 2048-byte hdwr sectors (636 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
 sda:
MSDOS: Hardware sector size is 2048
[MS-DOS FS Rel. 12,FAT 16,check=n,conv=b,uid=0,gid=0,umask=022]
[me=0xf8,cs=8,#f=2,fs=1,fl=38,ds=77,de=512,data=85,se=0,ts=310352,ls=2048,rc=0,fc=4294967295]
Transaction block size = 2048
---------------------- end example --------------------------------
Perhaps, your MO disk will have the `ls' of a value smaller than 2048.
Logical sector size smaller than device sector size cannot be handled
with FAT of 2.4 series.
Thanks.
