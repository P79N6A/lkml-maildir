Re-Phase, "Carrier space" needs Linux to succeed.

Okay, is there not a cause for loading "closed source modules" via the new
API's and management tools?

I am sorry, I do not understand the context.
I give away lots of work which is paid for by various companies who desire
broarder support for their product.  If I recall correctly, Intel is a
promoter of Serial ATA, yet it took another vendor whose interest in
working with the open source community funded the "free release" of a
generic IOPS driver layer change, and the crossover support for various
archs.  Just so you know, they are totally aware the release of the
project would also enable their competion.  They are betting their product
is superior and put the money down to prove it!
So why not have the "Carrier" people post a list of tasks to be completed
and the monetary value and let the opensource community play in the
bidding process to earn the contract?
You specify it to be totally open source and IP generated shall be demeed
public and not open for patents.
Will the carrier folks step up to the BAR and do the right thing by the
many individuals in the community or shield themselves in wordy
specifications and compliance terms?
Please point out why this is wrong?
