From Documentation/oops-tracing.txt:
'G' if all modules loaded have a GPL or compatible license, 'P' if
 any proprietary module has been loaded.
...
In other words, your kernel is tainted, but all modules are GPL.
See also the check in panic.c:
...
tainted & TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE ? 'P' : 'G',
...
It seems that yout kernel was tainted by a machine check exception (MCE).
This should be visible in dmesg somewhere, and might indicate a hardware
problem.
