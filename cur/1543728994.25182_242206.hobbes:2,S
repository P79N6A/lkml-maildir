Probably should say PCI APIs properly, it now does enable/disable devices
and registers the DRM as owning the memory regions, does proper PCI
probing .. in cases where the fb is loaded on the card already it falls
back to the old ways (evil direct register writing.. ), this change will
stop you loading the fb driver adter the drm driver but this shouldn't be
a common case at all..
