Isn't it also necessary to change the sprintf() format strings to %lu?
That is,
        len = sprintf(page, "cpu  %lu %lu %lu %lu\n", user, nice, system,
                      jif * smp_num_cpus - (user + nice + system));
Also, it looks like the per_cpu loop that follows the sprintf() also
has this bug, i.e., adding three ints to get a long.  Short of making
the kstat fields longs, it should suffice to just use a cast there,
and adjust the related sprintf(), e.g., to
                len += sprintf(page + len, "cpu%d %lu %lu %lu %lu\n",
                        i,
                        kstat.per_cpu_user[cpu_logical_map(i)],
                        kstat.per_cpu_nice[cpu_logical_map(i)],
                        kstat.per_cpu_system[cpu_logical_map(i)],
                        jif -
           ((unsigned long) kstat.per_cpu_user[cpu_logical_map(i)] +
                            kstat.per_cpu_nice[cpu_logical_map(i)] +
                            kstat.per_cpu_system[cpu_logical_map(i)]));
Might be worth sticking
	int cpu = cpu_logical_map(i);
at the top of the loop too, to clean that code up a bit.
Anyway, I'll have a go at the above and get back to you in about 48.5
days. :-)
Thanks!
