Yup, I'm putting it in linux-next to see if anything pops up. It's of
course possible that it will introduce regression somewhere but seeing
the hit SLUB is taking from the page allocator, I'm bound to think that
performance increase claims of commit
aadb4bc4a1f9108c1d0fbd121827c936c2ed4217 ("SLUB: direct pass through of
page size or higher kmalloc requests") don't hold anymore.
