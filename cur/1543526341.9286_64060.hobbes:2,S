Subject: More than 8 SCSI disks?

How do I go about having more than 8 SCSI disks? I made the /dev/sdhX,
/dev/sdiX, etc. files, but I'm not sure what else needs to be changed.
In particular, I'm tempted to change N_SD_MAJORS in sd.h, but I have a
feeling that's for the major number (which also happens to be 8) rather than
the maximum number of disks allowed. 
Any hints?
