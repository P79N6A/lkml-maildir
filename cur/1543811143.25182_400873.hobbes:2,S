I don't think this is clear at all. The entire file should always be 
cached, not doing this would be insane.

fseek() is a C library call, not a system call itself - there may be 
something that glibc is doing differently. Are you using the same glibc 
version with both kernels?
Just from this program it could be something else entirely that explains 
the difference in speed, like the random number generator..
