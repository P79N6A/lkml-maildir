You are correct, I fat-fingered the kernel version, 2.4.14 is what I'm
running.  Been running 2.4.x kernels for quite a while now, and I catch
myself freqently making that mistake when I type the version.

Will give the 2.4.16-pre1 kernel a shot and see how it behaves.
I should have mentioned in my intial post as well that I've seen both
hard locks (as in this case) and soft locks (where I could use the
'magic sysreq key' feature), both of which referenced this particular
code segment.
Thanks for the quick response.
