Robin Humble was using a DDR InfiniBand network, while my tests were
performed with an SDR InfiniBand network. Robin's results can't be
directly compared to my results.
Pete Wyckoff's results
(
http://www.osc.edu/~pw/papers/wyckoff-iser-snapi07-talk.pdf
) are hard
to interpret. I have asked Pete which of the numbers in his test can
be compared with what I measured, but Pete did not reply.

Pete wrote about a degradation from 600 MB/s to 500 MB/s for reads
with STGT+iSER. In my tests I measured 589 MB/s for reads (direct
I/O), which matches with the better result obtained by Pete.
Note: the InfiniBand kernel modules I used were those from the
2.6.22.9 kernel, not from the OFED distribution.
