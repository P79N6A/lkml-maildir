Well, there doesn't appear to be any reference to a setting in my BIOS
for this size(IOMMU).  So I don't think that I can change it!  :(
The machine is working quite a bit better with pci=noacpi in leu of
disabling ACPI in the BIOS, but there are still those nasty errors in
reference to the ACPI tables being broken:
    ACPI-0362: *** Error: Looking up [\_SB_.PCI0.LNK0] in namespace,
AE_NOT_FOUND
search_node ffff8101428572c0 start_node ffff8101428572c0 return_node
0000000000000000
And this one about the 8254 timer:
..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
And finally, I think that something else kind of wierd is happening with
the on-board sensors.  lm_sensors is having trouble detecting the fan
speeds and temperatures of the main board, but I will take that up with
their developers.
