It obviously works for me.  offsetof is very standard C.  I'd venture
to say that a system which can't find it has a broken gcc installation.

/usr/include/linux/stddef.h (but see below) - this is a userspace
file, so it builds against libc headers.

Well, /usr/include/linux/stddef.h on my x86_64 box has no offsetof,
despite being FC5 just like my i386 laptop.  Yay for consistency.
However, there is a /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.1/include/stddef.h
which defines offsetof (and there's a corresponding file on my
laptop), so I bet that's the true source of offsetof.
