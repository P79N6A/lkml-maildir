There's perhaps an opportunity to do this lazy TLB trick in the mmap
path as well, where RW mappings are initially mapped as RO so we can
catch processes dirtying them and then switched to RW. If the mapping is
shared across threads on multiple cores, we can defer synchronizing the
TLBs on the others.
