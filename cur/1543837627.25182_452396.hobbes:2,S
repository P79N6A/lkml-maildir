At the time we discuss how to support 48 bit xattr in the current inode, 
we were thinking about patching ext3, thus it's not likely we will going 
to do a deep surgery on the on-disk ext3 inode itself to have room for 
another 16bit xattr. So the plan at that is to steal some unused bits 
and construct with existing 32bit xattr to come with a 48bit xattr in total.
Given the fact that we are creating a new filesystem ext4, the ideal way 
(long term) probably we should support 64bit xattr in the ext4 inode, 
that is possible. The plan is to focus on support 48bit ext4 first, then 
probably move on next few things that also requires on-disk format 
changes, this is an experiment filesystem at this moment....
Thanks,
Mingming
