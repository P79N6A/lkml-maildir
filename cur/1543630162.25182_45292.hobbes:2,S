struct module has static storage duration, all elements are
automatically set to 0 unless otherwise defined.
Which compiler is giving warnings?  If you are using a compiler that
requires all elements of a static storage variable be initialized then
it appears to be in violation of the C standard.
  6.7.8 Initialization
  19 The initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each
     initializer provided for a particular subobject overriding any
     previously listed initializer for the same subobject; all
     subobjects that are not initialized explicitly shall be
     initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static
     storage duration.
Static storage duration objects are set to 0.
