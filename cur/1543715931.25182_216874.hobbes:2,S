Marcelo,
Will you accept patches allowing gcc-3.4.0 to compile
2.4.27 or not? I can understand if you want to be
conservative and not change _anything_ if you don't have to.
gcc-3.4.0 errors out in 2.4.27-pre1 due to (a) inconsistent
FASTCALL declarations, (b) uninlinable inlines, and (c)
-funit-at-a-time which seems to leave unresolved calls to
strcpy() around [gcc optimises sprintf "%s" to strcpy()].
There are also tons of warnings due to cast-as-lvalue
and "+m" asm() constraints.
I currently have a 40KB+ patch for 2.4.27-pre1 which works
for me on i386, UP and SMP. The changes are all backports
from 2.6. I'll do x86_64 and ppc(32) in a few days.

is the location of the current version.
