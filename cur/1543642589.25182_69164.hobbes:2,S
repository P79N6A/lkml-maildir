Remember this is a NUMA machine - gathering global information
is extremely expensive. On an SMP system, I wouldn't expect it
to show up so much, though it still doesn't seem terribly efficient. 
The code is admits it's broken anyway, for the overcommit = 2 case
(which was NOT what I was running - the 20% is for 1). Below is a 
simple patch that I've never got around to testing, that I think 
will improve that case (not that I'm that interested in setting
overcommit to 2 ;-)).

Can you use per-zone stats rather than global ones? That tends to
fix things pretty efficently on these type of machines - per zone 
LRUs made a huge impact.
Here's a little patch (untested!). I'll go look at the other case
and see if there's something easy to do, but I think it needs some
significant rework to do anything.
