Please no, 30 seconds is way too long for "your mains power is
knackered, please fiddle with the power connector again" notification.
When I jiggle the wire I need to know if it's making contact within 1
second, and if it's lost when I let it go, I need to know that within
1 second so I can jiggle it some more.
Probably should try some contact cleaner ;-)
