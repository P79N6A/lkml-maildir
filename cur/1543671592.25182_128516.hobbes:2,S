Hello,
I purchase a COMPAQ DL-320 G2. I've installed Redhat 7.3 with a driver disk
supplied by COMPAQ, that contains the binary of LSI MegaRAID ATA controller
driver, without problems.
Well... Now, I need to upgrade and rebuild the kernel (2.4.18 to 2.4.20)
but, I haven't got the source code of the LSI MegaRAID ATA controller.
Can anybody help me?
Best Regards,
-
