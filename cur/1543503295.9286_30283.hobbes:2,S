I've finally returned home and looked at your new resource code. I like
the generalization you've done, but I think it still needs several
improvements:
(1) We need a way how to search for free region to assign to a new
    device (for example when a new card is inserted or when the BIOS
    forgets to assign an address to a PCI device). This is exactly
    what the occupy_region function Dave Hinds has written and I have modified
    was doing. It needs to be given a resource pool, minimal and maximal
    address allowed (several devices limit address ranges they're
    able to process) and also required alignment (PCI regions must
    be aligned on a multiple of their size).
(2) For this address allocation we need to know not only which regions
    are allocated by drivers, but also which ones are in use by devices
    even if there is no driver handling them. This can be done by making
    generic bus code (which enumerates all devices on the bus) allocate
    all the regions automatically, but then we need to modify all the
    drivers not to request the regions and leave it only in ISA drivers.
    This requires changing almost every driver, but it's a clean way to go.
(3) As we are in need of doing such major changes, it would be better to
    take this chance and generalize the things even a bit more: introduce
    a concept of `device' (represented by a structure having a generic
    header and bus-specific fields), automatically attach resource regions
    to devices during bus enumeration and then attach drivers to devices
    during driver init. [This has been described in detail in in the
    bus/device/hotplug proposal I've sent to linux-kernel a month ago.]
If you agree with this course, I'll start implementing it immediately.
				Have a nice fortnight
