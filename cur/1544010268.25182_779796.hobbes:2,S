Yeah, SLAB is actually very hard to beat, much of the time.

Oh OK. Hmm, you do have SLQB debugging compiled in by the looks. I
haven't really been looking at code generation in that case. I don't
expect that would cause a significant difference in your case,
though.
Anyway, I'll see if I can work out why SLQB is slower. Do you have
socketallocbench online?
