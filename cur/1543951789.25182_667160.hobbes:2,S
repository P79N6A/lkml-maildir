No, it's not normal.  I'd say the VM makes bad decisions if _moderate_
swapping behaves badly.  Heavy swapping is another story.  (I think Rik
is addressing some VM issues as we speak, so hopefully it will improve
soonish)

Me too.  In the past, I tested swap heavily (and beat it into submission
when it misbehaved for me), but haven't tested swap performance since
becoming fairly ram-wealthy.
