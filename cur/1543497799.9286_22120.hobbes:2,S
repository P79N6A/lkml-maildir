Why do several prominent firewall and networking companies shun or speak foul of our
networking, saying we drop so many packets under load that linux simply isn't an
acceptable platform for their product?  This is most recently in reference to
certain other lists conversations about watching a packet stream with tcpdump and
noticing missing packets.  Is there any truth in this or is it FUD?  Some people say
skbuffs are faster, some say they are overloaded with extraneous information.  What
is more correct?
