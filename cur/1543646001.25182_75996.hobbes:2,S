While you are grotting aroung in this area - a thought / request.
When we get IPv4 link-local autoconf addressing in widespread use, there is a 
problem on multi-homed machines.
Assume B has two network interfaces (B1 and B2) on seperate IPv4 links (net1 
and net2). Host A is on net1 and Host C is on net2. Assume that both Host A 
and Host C have the same autoconf address. So IP address is not enough 
information for Host B to use to determine which interface to use in order to 
contact Host A (instead of Host C).
If host B has socket binding on IP+port+local interface, it all works out.
Is this going to work?
Brad
