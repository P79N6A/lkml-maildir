WRONG!!!
Not documenting your code is not a sign of good coding, but rather shows
arrogance, laziness and contempt for "those who would dare tamper with your
code after you've written it".  Document and comment your code thoroughly.
Do it as you go along.  I was also taught to comment nearly every line - as
part of the coding style used by a large, international company I worked for
several years ago.  It brings the logic of the programmer into focus and
makes code maintenance a whole lot easier.  It also helps one to remember
the logic of your own code when you revisit it a year or more hence.
