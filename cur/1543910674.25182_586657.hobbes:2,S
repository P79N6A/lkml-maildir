scheduler_tick() is based on the HZ timer which uses the TOD clock =
real time. sched_clock() currently uses the TOD clock as well so in
regard to the new scheduler we currently do not have a problem. We have
a problem with cpu time accounting, the change to the /proc code breaks
the precise accounting on s390. To solve the cpu time accounting we need
to change sched_clock() to the cpu timer = virtual time. To change the
scheduler_tick() as well requires another patch and I fear it would
complicate things in the s390 backend.
And if you say that the scheduling becomes invariant to steal-time, how
is the cpu time accounting via sum_exec supposed to work if it does not
take steal-time into account ?
