Output from a program to a serial port is buffered, and is thus
asynchronous to the program.  printk output is synchronous, and as
such will interrupt the normal IO to the port.
If you're going to use delays, you need to take account of the serial
port baud rate and adjust the delay accordingly.  However, you don't
really know how many characters are pending in the kernel anyway.
I don't think there's an answer to this if you're going to run both
applications and kernel console on the same port.
