Hi,
This was reported on the reiserfs list yesterday.  Seems that the cleanup
applied late in  2.4.5-pre affected the locking of the umount process.  This
was posted to fix the problem.

Hi,
You are right.
It seems, the next patch can fix umount reiserfs bug in linux-2.4.5 :
diff -urN v2.4.5/fs/reiserfs/super.c linux/fs/reiserfs/super.c
