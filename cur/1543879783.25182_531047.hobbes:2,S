That's irrelevant. Plugsched was an attempt to get alternative
schedulers exposure in mainline. I know, because I remember
encouraging Bill to pursue it. Not only did you veto plugsched (which
may have been a perfectly reasonable thing to do), but you also vetoed
the whole concept of multiple schedulers in the tree too. "We don't
want to balkanize the scheduling landscape".
And that latter part is what I'm claiming has set us back for years.
It's not a technical argument but a strategic one. And it's just not a
good strategy.

Disagree. Things didn't actually get interesting until Nick showed up
with AS and got it in-tree to demonstrate the huge amount of room we
had for improvement. It took several iterations of AS and CFQ (with a
couple complete rewrites) before CFQ began to look like the winner.
The resulting time-sliced CFQ was fairly heavily influenced by the
ideas in AS.
Similarly, things in scheduler land had been pretty damn boring until
Con finally got Andrew to take one of his schedulers for a spin.

Thankfully no one came out and said "we don't want to balkanize the
allocator landscape" when I submitted it or I probably would have just
dropped it, rather than painfully dragging it along out of tree for
years. I'm not nearly the glutton for punishment that Con is. :-P
