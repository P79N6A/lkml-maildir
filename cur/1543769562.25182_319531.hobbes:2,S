Ah, sorry, I mistook that for a code decrease and not binary decrease.

No, don't feel like this was noise at all, it wasn't.  I was just
commenting on the patch, letting you know that it was a great place to
start, but it might be tweaked a bit in places.
Don't worry about polishing stuff up before sending it in, you have seen
some of my patches, right?  :)
Also, there is a neat trick that you can do every once in a while if you
use it sparingly.  Propose a patch that you know is wrong, just to get
someone else (usually the maintainer of the area) to do it correctly as
they don't like your way at all.  It's very effective when used in small
doses.
Hm, which makes me want to go look at trying to convert those attributes
to an array right now...
thanks,
