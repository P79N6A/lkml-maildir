While playing with hdparm to solve my Cyrix related problem I found
interesting fact.
hdparm -t /dev/hdc print something like
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.19 seconds =10.34 MB/sec
with all my self-built 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.
When using prebuilt 2.2.5-22 from RedHat it shows approx. 12.26 MB/sec.
I tried to configure my kernel with same .config like
kernel-2.2-i586.config from Red Hat, tried the same compiler
(egcs-2.91.66 egcs-1.1.2 release), but with no luck.
I think this has something to do with one of the 40 kernel patches in
kernel-2.2.5-22.src.rpm. Which one ?
Does the 2MB/s difference from hdparm test mean anything in a real-world situation ?
My motherboard is P5VX-Be with PIIX3 IDE controller and the HD is Maxtor 90680D4
thanks,
