A) It was actually used twice during 2.1, but it got later removed by other
changes.
B) Using pre initialized headers for skbuffs gives an about 20% forwarding 
rate improvement for fast routing.
C) Read Bonwick's original paper before doing any changes to slab.c.

You did not understand the basic idea behind slab: it is an object cache
that is able to cached _initialized_ objects, because for some objects
it is more expensive to initialize them than to use them in the fast path.
Skbuffs are exactly such an example. Moving the constructor into the caller
does not work, because the caller doesn't know if the object was freshly 
allocated from the page allocator, or was from an already initialized object
cache. In the later case it does not need to initialize at all!
Linus, please don't apply this bogus patch.
Thank you,
