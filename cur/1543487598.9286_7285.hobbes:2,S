This thundering herd problem can be solved in userland, if I am not mistaken.
From what I've read, Apache solves this problem by having a single task do the
select(), and setting an appropriate semaphore on return.  The rest of the
tasks which would normally do a select() instead wait on this semaphore -- when
the semaphore is available, a single task is unblocked from waiting on it.
