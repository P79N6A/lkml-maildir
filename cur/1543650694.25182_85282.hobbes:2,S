Let's start from fsync_super() then.
Reiser4 has data journalling.
When ->writepage() is called on dirtied page, page joins transaction.
During umount all out-standing transaction have to be committed.  But if
file were mmapped, then, at the moment of the call to ->kill_super()
pages can be dirtied without ->writepage() ever called on them.
generic_shutdown_super() calls fsync_super(sb) (which will call
->writepage() on each dirty page) and then invalidate_inodes().
Reiser4 has commit out-standing transactions -between- these two points:
after ->writepage() has been called on all dirty pages, but before
inodes were destroyed. Thus, we cannot use
kill_block_super()/generic_shutdown_super().
