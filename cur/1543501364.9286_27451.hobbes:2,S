I've seen numerous reports about repeated lockups without traces. I've had
a similar experience but completely solved it by changing the motherboard.
I don't know why it would hang, but most likely the motherboard didn't like
the heat or didn't like my CPU or whatever. Changing various BIOS settings
would improve stability somehow, but the next evening the system would be 
frozen again. No traces, nothing, just stopped.
Since the same board ran flawlessly with the old CPU I knew that it 
was a hardware issue, and, as mentioned before, the new motherboard 
completely solved the problem. I encourage everybody with these lockups 
to try several different kernels and only cry murder if only one particular
version causes these problems.
Cheers
Rudi
