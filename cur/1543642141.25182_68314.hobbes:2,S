_devel is pretty stable.  You don't have to use the latest, just
clone up to the changeset including 2.4.18/19 if you like.  Or,
as you suggest, just use it as a reference to make a one-off
mod in your own tree.  I put in these options because of the
numbers of times I had to hack these things for specific embedded
applications. :)
