Is there a website somewhere that details all the kernel
related projects that are going on and who is involved
in each..or a pointer to their website? Like the DVD
project? I havent heard about it until now..
If I was a comptent kernel hacker..working on it:) I 
would be interested in working on it, but I dont know
things like this exist.
If their isnt a website.. I would be willing to create
one. Maybe in conjuntion with linuxhq.com or someone else
that already has a well established linux website.
This would allow us to keep track of project maintainers
for future reference. 
Mike..
