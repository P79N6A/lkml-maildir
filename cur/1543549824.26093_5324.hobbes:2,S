a SIGKILL? i agree with the 2.2 solution - first a soft signal, and if

good question :-)

i think the GFP_USER case should do the oom logic within __alloc_pages(),
by SIGTERM/SIGKILL-ing off abusive processes. Ie. it's *still* an infinite
loop (barring the case where *this* process is abusive, but thats a
detail).
