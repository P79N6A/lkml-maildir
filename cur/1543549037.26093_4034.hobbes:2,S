Ok, I made a parition on floppy, now do I access it? 
	Command (m for help): p
	Disk /dev/fd0: 2 heads, 18 sectors, 80 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 36 * 512 bytes
	    Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/fd0p1             1        80      1431   83  Linux
I did
	mknod /dev/fd0p1 b 2 1
However, neither 'mkswap' nor 'mke2fs' seems to work on '/dev/fd0p1'
(why I try to do this? I'm trying empirically verify if 'mkswap' will
check for partion type (ie is this '82') before mkswap-ing it. IMHO, it
shouldl.... )
