Subject: [PATCH] Missing critical phys_to_virt in lib/swiotlb.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: David Moore <dcm@acm.org>
Adds missing call to phys_to_virt() in the
lib/swiotlb.c:swiotlb_sync_sg() function.  Without this change, a kernel
panic will always occur whenever a SWIOTLB bounce buffer from a
scatter-gather list gets synced.

This change was originally part of a larger patch by Jan Beulich, which
was more extensive and doesn't look destined to make it into 2.6.20:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20-rc6/2.6.20-rc6-mm3/broken-out/ia64-swiotlb-bug-fixes.patch
However, considering the severity of this one-liner bug, I would like to
request that this simplified patch make it into 2.6.20, despite how
close we are to the final cut.  It fixes real crashes:
