I suspect that's the same report.

This is my commit message for the revert - note the suggested possible 
fix (but also why I didn't apply it, and why things got reverted).

    Revert "skge: fix ram buffer size calculation"
    
    This reverts commit 7fb7ac241162dc51ec0f7644d4a97b2855213c32.
    
    Heikki Orsila reports that it causes a regression:
    
      "Doing
    
    	nc host port < /dev/zero
    
       on a sending machine (not skge) to an skge machine that is receiving:
    
    	nc -l -p port >/dev/null
    
       with ~60 MiB/s speed, causes the interface go malfunct. A slow
       transfer doesn't cause a problem."
    
    See
    
    	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9321
    
    for some more information.
    
    There is a workaround (also reported by Heikki):
    
      "After some fiddling, I noticed that not changing the register write
       order on patch:
    
       +       skge_write32(hw, RB_ADDR(q, RB_END), end);
               skge_write32(hw, RB_ADDR(q, RB_WP), start);
               skge_write32(hw, RB_ADDR(q, RB_RP), start);
       -       skge_write32(hw, RB_ADDR(q, RB_END), end);
    
       fixes the visible effect..  Possibly not the root cause of the
       problem, but changing the order back fixes networking here."
    
    but that has yet to be ack'ed or tested more widely, so the whole
    problem-causing commit gets reverted until this is resolved properly.
