Have you read those:
         
http://acl.bestbits.at/man/extattr.5.html
         
http://acl.bestbits.at/man/extattr.2.html
Why is this inadequate? The above specify perfectly well what the current 
defined EA namespaces are, and the API is extensible in that should people 
come up with other useful namespaces (I can't think of any) they can just 
be added without any modification to the generic EA interface in the kernel 
and that is good.
NTFS for example has no concept of different EA classes and I am planning 
to only support the "user." namespace and just adding "user." before 
returning an EA and removing it when writing an EA. All other classes will 
just return that such beasts are not supported.

A binary interface is much worse. While with the current interface it is 
arbitrary, at least it is defined, so yes, it is set in stone for ever 
more, and that is a Good Thing, you don't want to be changing that in the 
future.
However you are missing a very important point and that is that this is the 
EA API for the kernel. There is nothing to stop glibc (or some EA library) 
defining whatever different interface they like and exposing that to user 
space.

I don't see why any of this should happen. The interface for EAs is well 
defined in the above referenced documents. And note that we already have 
attribute namespaces, that is the whole point of the "user.", "system.", 
etc. That is what is used to distinguish the various classes. Or did I miss 
your point completely?
Best regards,
Anton
