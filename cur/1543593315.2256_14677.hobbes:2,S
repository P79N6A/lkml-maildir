You can use either dprobes to set up a tracepoint dynamically anywhere you
please see:
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux/projects/dprobes
Or, you can use gkhi to define a hook anywhere in the kernel you please.
You can write a hook exit as a kmod to do whatever you fancy and have it
activate at a tome of your choosing. See,
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux/projects/gkhi
Or, you can investigate some of the standard tracepoint Linux Trace Toolkit
creates, see: 
http://www.opersys.com/
And that's only three of many....

Subject:  I/O tracing
Hi,
     Please CC me as I'm not subscribed on the list, thanks.  Not sure if
this is appropriate forum, is there an existing tool/module for capturing
all the I/O requests such as:
Unique Identifier
Start Time
End Time
Device Identifier
Operation Type (Read Or Write)
Offset
Length (Number Of Bytes)
I am aware of existing /proc/disks and partitions, but these aren't real
time.  If not, are there any facilities in the kernel I can put a hook in
to
keep track of the I/O?
Thanks in advance,
Sammy Yu
