Any idea on where I can find it?  This sounds like it would be very
useful.

Mainly because I want to set up cache types for different memory objects
in memory. I want a certain region to be WB, some to be WC, some to be
USWC, etc.  To set the cache types (with MTRR's), I need the physical
address.  (Note: this is for a highly specialized testing tool, not a
regular application).
