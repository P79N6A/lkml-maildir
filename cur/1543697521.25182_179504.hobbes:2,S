The problem is still reproducible with 2.4.23-rc3. And the box has
rebooted suddently after 10 days running 2.4.23-pre9 in the weird 1+2xHT
mode. After the reboot, the second CPU disappeared and now I saw that
the BIOS disabled both CPUs, maybe because of detected errors.

Both logs from 2.4.23-pre and 2.4.21 can be found on:
