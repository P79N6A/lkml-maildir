There's a difference, though.  It doesn't cause the resources flags to be
cleared for the cardbus bridge and the cardbus bridge gets the correct sizes
of both prefetchable and non-prefetchable windows (64 MB).

I know that. :-)  Still, I find it important to notice that the memory windows
of the cardbus bridge can be 64 MB-wide and things work in that case too.
Also, I like it more than the previous patch. ;-)
Moreover, I _think_ it would work for Frans too, because I _suspect_ the
problem is related to a cardbus bridge being located behind that "transparent"
thing somehow.

No prob, both attached along with the contents of /proc/iomem .

Well, not exactly.  Actually, with this patch the graphics and "ICH HD audio"
get their memory ranges before the ranges of _all_ devices behind the
transparent bridge, while in the "working" case their memory ranges are located
_after_ the memory ranges of devices behind the transparent bridge _except_
for the cardbus bridge's memory windows.
Thanks,
