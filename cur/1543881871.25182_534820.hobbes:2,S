You mentioned the continued use of init_mm.  This is *very* different.
What we're seeing here is that ON PSE-CAPABLE HARDWARE, we continue to
not just use the init_mm page directory, but the actual page *tables*,
which should all have been replaced with PSE large pages to begin with.
Reusing the initial page tables on non-PSE-capable hardware *sort of*
makes sense, but his hardware should not fall in that category, I don't
think?  (Unless it's one of these machines that fall over if you map the
bottom 4 MB with PSE pages?)
