What about this:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Huge memory support
CONFIG_HUGEMEM
  Enables kernel support for really huge amounts of RAM (beyond 1 Gigabyte)
  Linux currently supports up to almost 1 Gigabyte of RAM (960MB to be exact)
  on Intel and compatibles computers.
  If this is too little for you, there are two things you can do:
  1: Increase manually the limit to 1984MB.
     Read the note in include/linux/page.h to do this.
  2: Use the RAM above the 960MB limit (or above 1984MB if you applied 1:)
     as a special ramdisk.
  Saying Y here makes it possible to use the solution 2:
  use the RAM above the limit as a ramdisk.
  Note that to actually enable this ramdisk, you must also say Y to the
  "Huge Ramdisk support" below.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Huge Ramdisk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HUGERAMD
  Saying Y here makes it possible to use the memory above 1 Gigabyte
  as a ramdisk. This only works if you have enabled "Huge Memory support".
  The ramdisk can be accessed through block special files
  /dev/hugeram0 ... /dev/hugeram7, with major number 126 and
  minor numbers 0..7 (do "man mknod" for help how to create them)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Also, the note in linux/include/asm-i386/page.h was fixed
(0x7000000 -> 0x80000000) in 2.2.1 so everything should be fine.
