You presented it as "this is a neat way to find all the CD-ROMs".
But it doesn't unless you can change the code to handle new
interfaces as they come along.
So any app you're not going to recompile regularly needs a configuration
file.  In which case, why not just list all the standard CD-ROM
locations there?
