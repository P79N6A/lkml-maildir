On my previous mail, I said that CONFIG_LBD should not determine
whether large single files is enabled.  But after further
consideration, on such a small system that CONFIG_LBD is disabled,
using large filesystem over network seems to be very rare.
So I think that the type of i_blocks should be sector_t.
Below shows the updated patch.
This patch fixes st_blocks of >2TB file on 32-bit linux.
- inode.i_blocks
  changes to sector_t whose size depends on CONFIG_LBD.
- kstat.blocks
  changes to `unsigned long long'.
- stat64.st_blocks
  changes to `unsigned long long' on i386, m68k and sh.
Any feedback and comments are welcome.
