Or mmap().
But, yes, whilst that's true; the read() is almost certainly going to occur
very quickly after the open(), and so the likelyhood is that asynchronicity is
not going to matter.

The former model is much more complex than the latter, and also has perfomance
issues.
Besides, the latter model seems to work for me (as long as I'm allowed to
change the security ID a process is acting as).

But it *is* process context...
I'm not sure what to do about that.  I could maintain a record of every page
being serviced by FS-Cache, but that could be an awful lot of pages, and so
consume an awful lot of memory.
I'm hesitant about allocating memory to hold a list of pages in that context as
it might fail.

I wish you'd mentioned that six months or more ago when I first waved these
patches in front of you.

What has "accessing the remote filesystem" got to do with it?

Sigh.
The user process may not do a read() or an mmap() on a read-only file it has
just opened until we've found the data storage object in the cache associated
with that file, or it has created one.
However, several user processes may be accessing several different files on
serveral different mounts of maybe several different netfs's all at the same
time.  This could mean that on behalf of each of these processes, CacheFiles
has to create serveral directories and a file.
But it may only have one thread in which to do this, and so each "cache lookup"
will wind up being serialised around the synchronous ext3 operations that
create files and directories and set xattrs.  Consider:
	SERVICE	PROC A	PROC B	PROC C	PROC D
	=======	=======	=======	=======	=======
		open()	open()	open()	open()
	A:lookup()
	A:mkdir()
	A:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()
	A:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()
	A:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()
	A:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()
	A:setxattr()
	A:create()
	A:setxattr()
		read()
	B:lookup()
	B:mkdir()
	B:setxattr()
	B:mkdir()
	B:setxattr()
	B:mkdir()
	B:setxattr()

	C:mkdir()

	D:mkdir()
	D:setxattr()

	D:setxattr()
	D:mkdir()
	D:setxattr()
	D:mkdir()
	D:setxattr()
	D:mkdir()
	D:setxattr()
	D:create()
	D:setxattr()
					read()
Which is what you're suggesting.  Whereas what I have at the moment is this:
	PROC A		PROC B		PROC C		PROC D
	===============	===============	===============	===============	
	open()		open()		open()		open()
	A:lookup()	B:lookup()	C:lookup()	D:lookup()  
	A:mkdir()	B:mkdir()	C:mkdir()	D:mkdir()   
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()	B:mkdir()	C:mkdir()	D:mkdir()   
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()	B:mkdir()	C:mkdir()	D:mkdir()   
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()	B:mkdir()	C:mkdir()	D:mkdir()   
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	A:mkdir()	B:mkdir()	C:mkdir()	D:mkdir()   
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	A:create()	B:create()	C:create()	D:create()  
	A:setxattr()	B:setxattr()	C:setxattr()	D:setxattr()
	read()		read()		read()		read()
Even if you replace the mkdir()'s and create()'s with lookup()'s and the
setxattr()'s with getxattr()'s, it doesn't make much difference: lookup() and
getxattr() are both reads and both synchronous.

My point is that if userspace does open() + read() with no or little
intervening stuff, then asynchronicity is irrelevant as the whole process is
rendered effectively synchronous because the first read() has to wait on
completion.
And once an inode has been assayed for cache presence, subsequent open() calls
don't need to go to the cache as the state is retained in memory until the
inode is discarded.
