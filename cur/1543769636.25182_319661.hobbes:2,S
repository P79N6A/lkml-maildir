Subject: [PATCH] Turn off sibling call optimization w/ frame pointers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/20/61

Frame pointers are supposed to enable debuggers to reliably tell
where a call comes from. That is defeated by GCC's sibling call
optimization (aka tail recursion elimination).
This patch turns this optimization off when compiling with frame pointers.
