My point was that your signature does indicate your affiliation with a
lot of different organizations/companies, so unless you explicitly
state that you are not speaking on behalf of them it's easy to assume
you do.

Quoting from that web page: "FSF Latin America is a sister
organization of Free Software Foundation (FSF)"
So when your signature states that you are a "FSF Latin America Board
Member" and FSFLA is a "sister organization of Free Software
Foundation (FSF)" that, at least to me, implies some association with
the FSF.

No, it does not, but it's easy to mistake a post by someone posting
from a company email and including that company in their signature for
speaking for that company.

Of course not. The @redhat.com email is just one more thing, that
added together with the signature could lead people to believe you are
speaking on their behalf.
You were the one who brought up the " I should probably have made
clear that, as usual, I was speaking my own mind, not speaking on
behalf of ..." bit. I'm simply replying to you that indeed it is not
clear for whom you speak with all that info in your signature and the
email address you post from.
Especially the FSF association seems likely given that most of your
emails seem heavily influenced by the FSF cool aid.
