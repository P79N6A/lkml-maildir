Er, yes, that was supposed to be an 's64'. It only applies to sign
mismatch.

If it's supposed to be u64 only, then yes, the existing check should be
ok. There are a lot of places (time keeping code, lockdep, etc.) that
operate on signed values though, and from the comments in some places
this seems to be intentional (ie, kernel/lockdep_proc.c has this gem):
static void snprint_time(char *buf, size_t bufsiz, s64 nr)
{
        unsigned long rem;
        rem = do_div(nr, 1000); /* XXX: do_div_signed */
        snprintf(buf, bufsiz, "%lld.%02d", (long long)nr, ((int)rem+5)/10);
}

That seems to be an accurate asessment, yes. If do_div(s64, ...) is buggy
behaviour, then the current check is fine, and the callsites should be
corrected. Though if there's code in-tree that relies on s64 do_div, that seems
to be a more problematic issue.
