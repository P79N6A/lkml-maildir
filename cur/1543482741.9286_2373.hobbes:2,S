Eric wrote the executable loader, but I wrote the core dumper.  Most of the
parts Dave is complaining about were cribbed from the a.out core dumper.  I'm
not using that as a defence, because it's not pretty code, but it's not actively
broken.  Neither of Dave's direct comments are true, by the way: it does do the
right cleanups on error and there's nothing to be gained by holding the core
file's semaphore while writing the file.
That said, I'll give it a going over in the next day or so.
