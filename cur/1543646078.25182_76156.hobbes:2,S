No, they should _not_ be in do_mount.c either. They should be in the 
driver registration, and do_mount.c should not have a random list of 
devices. 
I'm not accepting do_mount.c expansion here, simply because I don't want 
to help a horribly broken interface. You can always use a hex number 
(which is what things like lilo will install anyway, I believe, rather 
than using the "root=/dev/xxx" command line), and if people get too tired 
about remembering numbers, maybe somebody who cares will step up to the 
plate and write a reverse of "__bdevname()" and do it right.
Hint: see __bdevname in fs/block_dev.c, and realize that it does the 
"kdev->name" translation without _any_ tables at all. Think about doing 
the same the other way, by just walking the registered block devices.
