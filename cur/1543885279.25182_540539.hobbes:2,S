We should allow a password to be specified (presumably it is not common 
for a server to have a password associated with a null user),
but probably not prompt (similar to "guest" - except for the case of 
guest, we start with the username of uid of current process, and
only if it fails with access denied do we try "user=" (or equivalently 
sec=none))
