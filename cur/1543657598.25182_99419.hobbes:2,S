libc neednt neccessarily use the kernel headers, it needs to use only 
headers that are compatible. Also, though it might use kernel headers, 
the headers it provides for other programmes to be compiled against it 
are not kernel headers.
further, the kernel's licence explicitely exempts the 'normal system 
calls', and kernel headers describing these can quite arguably be 
considered to fall within this exemption.
