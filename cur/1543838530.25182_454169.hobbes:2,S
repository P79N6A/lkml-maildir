Milton, your distribution of Linux should provide those.
For Debian Linux for example, you'd do:
$ dpkg -S lspci
pciutils: /usr/bin/lspci
..and you note that lspci is in the 'pciutils' package.
You could then do as follows:
$ apt-get update
....
$ apt-get source pciutils
The source would be downloaded and unpacked in the current working 
directory.
