To speed swapoff, I changed the code back to how fork (see comment
on "Add it to the mmlist" in fork.c old and new) and exec seemed to
intend.  I don't see see that I _obfuscated_ the code:
what's so difficult about swap_mm?

It was unnecessary and counter-productive, I changed it.
Exact number?  No, but small.
