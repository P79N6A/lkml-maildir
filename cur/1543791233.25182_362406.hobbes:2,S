Translation to what a sane person might have said:
Make sure you aren't bound by any non-disclosure agreements before posting a 
driver specification for public viewing.  Writing up such a spec from the 
source code (if the supplier didn't give you one) is probably a darn good 
idea either way, for your own internal maintenance purposes.  If you have the 
spare cycles...
