Yeah, of course. Just FHS closed this way as well. Yes, I (as distribution
maker) can make /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/i386-linux symlink to
/usr/local/lib/perl but since
-- cut --
This directory should always be empty after first installing a
FHS-compliant system.  No exceptions to this rule should be made other
than the listed directory stubs.
-- cut --
I (as distribution maker) can not create /usr/local/lib/perl directory.
Thus perl's make install will mysteriously fail while trying to install
stuff. Or I (as sysadmin) must GUESS that I should create /usr/local/lib/perl 
before using perl's `make install' ? Gosh. So much for FHS-compliance.
Or may be you can suggest some other clever way to solve this problem ?
P.S. May be I just poor in English and in fact creation of subdirectories
UNDER /usr/local (not IN /usr/local) is allowed ? At least it looks like
Debian mantainers think so:
-- cut --
  3.1.2 Site-specific programs
   As mandated by the FHS no package should place any files in
   /usr/local, either by putting them in the file system archive to be
   unpacked by dpkg or by manipulating them in their maintainer scripts.
   However, the package should create empty directories below /usr/local
   so that the system administrator knows where to place site-specific
   files. These directories should be removed on package removal if they
   are empty.
   Note, that this applies only to directories below /usr/local, not in
   /usr/local. The directory /usr/local itself may only contain the
   sub-directories listed in FHS, section 4.6. However, you may create
   directories below them as you wish. You may not remove any of the
   directories listed in 4.6, even if you created them.
-- cut --
It this is so then it's Ok: there are really no need to put anything in
/usr/local itself and under /usr/local only empty directoryes for local
stuff are needed...
Looks like FHS wording is too vague in this place...
