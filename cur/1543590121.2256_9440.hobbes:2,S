Ah, but now you are talking about a different bug.
Your original testcase only contained changes from the smbfs client (the
abc/xyz test). For me that is solved by this patch and I wanted you to
check if it did in your environment as well.
I have one other report of something being broken with changes made on the
server side only.
There is also yet another problem if you change a file from smbfs and from
the server. The smbfs side will remember the wrong filesize. This may be a
fix for that:
