Not much more. Really. Some pattern-serach over /dev/kmem will help for sure :-)
It's stupid thing to try "security through obscurity" when the whole source
code is exposed to world.

I don't think so. This patch is small and non-intrusive, so perhaps it's Ok
to add it to kernel but still it buys you effectively nothing so waht's the
point ?

Yeah. Hmm. Looks like I can userstood now: if direct access to hardware
(and to /dev/kmem, of course) is disabled (some router or firewall so
capabilities are removed from system) but you STILL need HDIO_DRIVE_CMD
then yes, in this RARE scenario this patch is usefull. Huh. Someone knows
at least ONE system in such configuration and with such need ?
