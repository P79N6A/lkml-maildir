Note that not all hardware supports inverse.
And on some hardware the cursor palette is shared with the screen palette,
that's why I had fb_fix_cursorinfo.crsr_color[12] in the original cursor API.
E.g. Amiga graphics don't have inverse. There are 8 sprites, each can have 3
colors (+ transparency). The colors are shared with the screen palette (unless
your screen has at most 16 colors):
  - sprites 0 and 1: transparent, palette[17], palette[18], palette[19]
  - sprites 2 and 3: transparent, palette[21], palette[22], palette[23]
  - sprites 4 and 5: transparent, palette[25], palette[26], palette[27]
  - sprites 6 and 7: transparent, palette[29], palette[30], palette[31]
There's also a special mode to combine an even an odd sprite to form a 15-color
(+ transparency) sprite.
Yes, it can be difficult to find a _good_ API ;-)
