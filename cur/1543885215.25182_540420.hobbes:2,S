Not this particular one, but you may try to move pm_finish() after
resume_console() in kernel/power/main.c:suspend_prepare() and see if that
helps.
If it doesn't help, then try to compile the kernel with NO_HZ and
HIGH_RES_TIMERS unset.  If that doesn't help, you may try with HPET_TIMER
unset additionally.
