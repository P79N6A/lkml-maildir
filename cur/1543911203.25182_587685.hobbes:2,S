3 patches?  I only saw 2.  Or do you mean the modifications of the 3
files?
The patches look sane but you should change the global symbols to play
nicer in the namespace.  Care to respin them together with this change?

Yeah, that shouldn't be that tough to do.
It doesn't look like these changes handle scrolling of the console, do
they?  If so, don't you need to do more?  I had some old patches around
here that had devices that wanted to know cursor positioning, which I
don't think this hook can handle :(
