So has anyone fixed the bugs involving ext3 and LVM snapshots on top of
DM mirror?
Our 32-bit Fedora Core 5 dual Opteron server at work crashed once a week
while running rdiff-backup off a snapshot.  Installing a 64-bit kernel
stopped the crashes, and I believe the 64-bit still uses the bigger
stacks.
