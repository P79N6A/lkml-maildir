Hello,
The following seems to be a kernel task, so I am asking here.
Situation: 
Some people upload Files in a certain Directory of a ftp server.
Some of the ftp jobs are very slow.
I have  to write a daemon which collects the files which are uploaded
(assumption the transfer alway succeeds - OK thats another topic).
Problem: Sometimes i process files, which are not uploaded (at this
time).
But I cannot determine which files are still open,
(different userids of all users).
I was adviced to use lsof or fuser but this _only_ gives me a 
complete listing of all busy (open) files when i am _root_. 
Is there another way (kernel function?) which allows my 
(not root) daemon to determine if the files are busy  ?
Regards 
Dietmar
