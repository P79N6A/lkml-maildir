I'd really like to see it go in, but I think some small problems are left,
mostly formatting. Please read Documentation/CodingStyle.
Please use tabs for indentation and not spaces.
You should consider using more inline functions, instead of lots of "do
{...} while(0)" macros.
Do we really need more usages of uint32_t or uint8_t in the kernel?
Instead of using lots of "#ifdef __arch__" you should move this into
<asm/trace.h>.
Comments are nice, but IMO your code does a bit too much of it, e.g.:
  /* Everything is OK */
  return 0;
or
  /* Unlock the table for reading */
  read_unlock(&custom_list_lock);
bye, Roman
