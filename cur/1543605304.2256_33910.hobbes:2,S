Well, it's not really any _new_ special casing - we've always had the
special case for order-0, the patch just expands it to order-1 too.
That said, I think a separate flag saying "don't try too hard", which can
be used for all orders, including 0 and 1, and just says that "ok, we want
you to balance things, but if this allocation fails that's not a big
deal".
So the flag would just always be implicit in allocations of higher orders,
because big orders are basically impossible to guarantee..
