Another case to look at.  I discovered that
char __initdata *cmd[] = {
	"command1",
	"command2",
	"command3",
	NULL
	};
Stores the 4 pointers of cmd in .init.data but the strings are down in
.rodata, i.e. they are not discarded after init.  I got around it by
static __initdata char str_command1[] = "command1";
static __initdata char str_command2[] = "command2";
static __initdata char str_command3[] = "command3";
char __initdata *cmd[] = {
	str_command1,
	str_command2,
	str_command3,
	NULL
	};
That put the strings in .init.data as well as the array.  This simpler
version might work but I have not tried it.
char __initdata *cmd[] = {
	__initdata "command1",
	__initdata "command2",
	__initdata "command3",
	NULL
	};
