What's the procedure for unregistering devices?
I have converted the PC speaker sound device to use the generic soundcore 
layer, and now it appears as a normal sound card on major 14, so it doesn't 
need the old allocation of major 13.
Could the corresponding entry in devices.t{xt,ex} be either deleted or marked
as obsolete, please?
I suspect that there's a lot more entries that could benefit from the same 
treatment.
