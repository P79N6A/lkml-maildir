The more I think about it the less clear and ambiguous I find it. 
When you add the dirty bit into the pot you get:
	 Mapped,  Uptodate,  Dirty:  not possible
	!Mapped,  Uptodate,  Dirty:  not possible
	 Mapped, !Uptodate,  Dirty:  pending write
	!Mapped, !Uptodate,  Dirty:  pending map and write
	 Mapped,  Uptodate, !Dirty:  regular block
	!Mapped,  Uptodate, !Dirty:  hole of zeroes
	 Mapped, !Uptodate, !Dirty:  unread
	!Mapped, !Uptodate, !Dirty:  pending map
Those two 'not possible' states bother me, they show that the three
bits are not orthogonal.  We can make arbitrary assignments of meaning
to them as you did with !Mapped, !Uptodate (pending map) but in that
case why not just enumerate all the states we need and lose the bit
assignments?  I think the deep problem here is trying to look at this
as a bit-flipping problem instead of a state-transition problem.
I'm not saying that the current design can't be made to work.  It can,
it's practically working now - it's just confusing as Al said, and
there are reasons for that.  It gets more confusing when you add in
the less-than-simple relationship between buffers and pages and then
try to make sense of the combination of the two sets of states.  The
motivation for making this less confusing is to be able to think about
optimization possibilities instead of just making it work.
