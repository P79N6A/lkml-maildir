It removed code. I counted both lines and size when deciding to take
that path 8)

ide_default in 2.6 has no open/close method. In the latest 2.4-ac (bits
I sent to Marcelo too) it has one because it now needs it.

The scsi scheme is somewhat broken, it also fails with hotplug because
if I ask for a reprobe of "0 0 0" and we change controllers - we've just
rescanned the wrong bus. Its only a small race but its real.

I can do
	umount /dev/hda
	hdparm -b0 /dev/hda
        hdparm -b1 /dev/hda
        mount /dev/hda
and mount a different disk/cd/dvd. Its very nice on the thinkpads
In the 2.4 case its a bit messier than I suspect you can do in 2.6
because I can't rely on sane behaviour if I remove queues etc, instead
I keep the queue around so that to the block layer nothing disappears
and is freed up causing race issues but to the IDE layer the right stuff
happens (I think ;))
