I see this with my ATAPI Zip-250 under 2.2.12, but fdisk, mke2fs,
etc, all work there.
ALAN: You will probably remember my commenting on seeing the
above message to you a while back. Any idea what might have
changed since to cause this?
Incidentally, when I put a Zip-100 disk in the drive, the two
values are approximately 250M and approximately 100M
resspectively, and when I put a Zip-250 in, they are DIFFERENT
numbers, but both approx 250M. I can't check the exact numbers at
the moment as the relevant box is down following a hard drive
crash...
