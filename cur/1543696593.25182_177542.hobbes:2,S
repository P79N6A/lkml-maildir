Ok, looks saner in the sense that now you seem to get no interrupts at all 
from your card. At least that matches the fact that you basically get no

So the previous vmstat was when there was a lot of network activity with
some associated server going on too?
So this same setup worked find for you with bonnie++ with a single disk?
