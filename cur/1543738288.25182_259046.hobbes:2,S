You are correct in your assumption that you didn't notice any user API
in the patch because it wasn't there.  The idea I had for the API would
be along the lines of the current cpusets/CKRM interface.  A
hierarchical filesystem where you can do operations to
create/modify/remove sched_domains.  Along the lines of:
cd /dev/sched_domains/sys_domain
mkdir node0
mkdir node1
mkdir node2
mkdir node3
cd node0
echo 0-3 > cpus
cd ../node1
echo 4-7 > cpus
cd ../node2
echo 8-11 > cpus
cd ../node3
echo 12-15 > cpus
To create a simple 4 node each w/ 4 cpus setup.  This is a trivial
example, because this is the kind of thing that would be setup by
default at boot time.  I really like the interface that Paul came up
with for cpusets, and I think that the interface we eventually settle on
should be along those lines.  Hopefully it can be shared with the
interface CKRM uses to avoid too much interface bloat.  I think that we
can probably get the two mechanisms to share a common interface.
