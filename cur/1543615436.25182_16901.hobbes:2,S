IIS and the phrase "secure websites" in one sentance ???
IIS can't be made secure, even if it is used at sites that claim to be
"secure".
This is a different problem domain from kernel configuration. You are
referring to an expert system for system administration. Or perhaps
a "System Administrators Assistant" program. (How about "Security
Administrators Assitant" ...)
Not an unreasonable project - just not one that can realistically be completed.
Maybe a "good enough" one though ...
