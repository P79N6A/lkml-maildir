It's a real card.

For various reasons that are far to boring to go into here, I'm not entirely
free in my choice of card.  What I'll probably do is try to get a rev 8 card
swapped in for the rev 12 one.  If I can't get a rev 8 card for that machine,
I'll go with the e100 driver and let you know what happens.
