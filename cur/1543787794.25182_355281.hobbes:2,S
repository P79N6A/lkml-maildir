You miss an important detail here, namely that single URBs do not have
a capability to transfer to a discotiguous buffer. As long as you try
to map one transfer insive VMware to one URB, one and only one kmalloc
has to be done. But if splitting the transfer is acceptable, there is
no reason to up the maximum buffer size in usbfs. But the above is IMHO
only, and perhaps I miss something as well.
