The non-data streams contain meta-data that is needed (directory indices,
for example). I would just read them through the buffer cache, but a lot of
the structures can and do exceed the block (cluster) size. Rather than reading
the things through the buffer cache and then allocating more kernel memory to
reassemble them in, it makes sense to allocate a page and create buffer_heads
that map to it. This doesn't provide any caching, so one of the options is to
try and handle them through the page cache.
