Hey folks,
I'm using a custom built 2.4.21 kernel from the Mandrake 9.1 distribution.  The hardware is dual AMD Athlon 2600+ system with 2Gb of registered DDR ECC memory, SCSI and ATA disks.
My apparent problem is I'm seeing virtually no buffer usage, as checked from /proc/meminfo.  The system has been up for 11 days, with heavy dB and file access activity (Gb's worth per day), yet the buffer usage never budges.  Am I missing something fundamental, have I boffed the kernel build, or is there a problem?  I would appreciate any pointers.
