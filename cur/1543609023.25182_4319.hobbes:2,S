Design the kernel to make doing this difficult.
Define some offsets as follows:
#define FOO_PID 0
#define FOO_PPID 1
Now, how is anyone going to create "an extra inserted DWORD"
between those? They'd need to renumber FOO_PPID and any other
values that come after it.
The "DWORD" idea is messed up too BTW. Use __u64 everywhere.
