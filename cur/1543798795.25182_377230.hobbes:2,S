So what do you mean when you say that there is "no lockd process
running" on the client?
Is it not appearing in the output of 'ps -ef' either?
Is anything at all listening on port 32768 on 'jacquere'? (check using
'netstat -ap | grep 32768').
Could anything be playing around with the 'pmap_set' utility so as to
corrupt portmap?
Are you perhaps setting /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nlm_udpport and/or the kernel
parameter nfs.nlm_udpport? If so, to what?
Cheers,
