Yes, and no. It doesn't support it in the version I sent to Jeff. I do
have code that uses it, and a kludge to use it under 2.4. As for 2.5, I
hope to work to get it supported with the IPSEC code properly.
I do support the other offloading it will do -- VLAN, Checksum, and TCP
segmentation.

And government work! I've got the paperwork in progress, should be RSN
as Jeff said. Word is no later than next Wednesday, though I'm pushing
for Friday.
I've got the firmware under a BSD style license that will work for us,
and the driver is completely GPL.
