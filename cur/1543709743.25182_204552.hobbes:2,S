We have tried that with our latest round of kernels (still 2.4), and the
results have been mixed. You need various headers outside include/ for
some obscure external modules. Amazingly there are even external modules
that make use of kernel C files.
All in all, in the end I changed my mind. I now think that it's better
to build modules against a clean kernel source tree that additionally
has the modversions file copied in. This already works when using O=.
With the SUBDIRS= approach, the kernel source tree must include a few
compiled files (scripts/ stuff), and it cannot be read-only.
I'm still undecided whether it makes sense to disallow the SUBDIRS=
approach completely and only allow building with O=. (Note that this
doesn't change the modversion dump file argument.) When building with
SUBDIRS=, you ideally want a (read-only) kernel source tree that can
adapt to different configurations (e.g., by doing like this:
   make -C $KERNEL_SOURCE modules SUBDIRS=$PWD FLAVOR=bigsmp
), the default being the running kernel. The RedHat kernel has had a
partial solution for merging autoconf.h. I have patches that implement a
more complete solution that I'd happily send them to an appropriate
place for discussion, but I don't think this would make much sense in
mainline. Particularly because, while O= building has a slightly higher
overhead, it gets rid of those problems, anyway.
