Please, no.  Try installing Microsoft Windows on some box if you want to
see this idea in action.  They've done it that way for years:  throw all
available drivers at the hardware and see which ones stick.  Pick a time
when you have a couple of hours to waste -- the process is agonizingly
slow.
Much better to simply ask each bus what's sitting on it.  Only non-PnP ISA
devices are unable to answer.  If the box has no ISA slots, then the
configuration can be done without any user intervention in a few
milliseconds.

MS Windows *is* user-friendly, but only for certain values of "user".
