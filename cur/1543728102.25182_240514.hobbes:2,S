actually I don't use a PREEMPT enabled kernel... but still see this
problem (but not with 2.6.7)...
I don't have a real idea what is causing this... anyway if I kill all
processes that were listed in lsof /dev/pts the problem seems gone... 
not sure whether this is some endianess thing (powerpc here)...
clueless,
