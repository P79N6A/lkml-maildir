             as i understand it, reiserfs (just like all journalling
filesystems)
             requires changes to the core kernel code which are
unacceptable at
             this point. but my understanding may be flawed.
Please DON'T have this accident! There are JFS and XFS on the way - both
are
more proven in the real world and there is a *much* higher wight behind
them.
It is better to wait a bit and let them
compete with each other for becoming the *de facto* next linux standard
filesystem then to let  RaiserFS play this role by accident of beeing
first... (QUOTAS - where are you there?). I think both of them are
a much much better design and what is more important they are much much
more tested (in terms of design) in the wild then RaiserFS.
