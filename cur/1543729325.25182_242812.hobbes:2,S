I wouldn't wasted ressources but it seems Alan found another problem.

You could still keep that information in your data structure.  But what
do you actually need it for?

Just keep some lookup data structure so you can find the device data
by host/target/lun numbers.

you're using the driver model, and that calls ->remove and every device
when the driver is unregistered.

Yes, please.
Okay, some brainstorming to get the data structures and lookup right:
What really seems to miss in your model is a callback to i2o_scsi
from the main i2o code when a new i2o_controller is found, if you implemented
that we'd allocate/deallocate the Scsi_Host in that callback and
->probe/->remove could be sure it'd always have it.
Anyway, I think we could live without that.
i2o_scsi_get_host would get inlined into i2o_scsi_probe.
i2o_scsi_remove basically needs a full rewrite, you need to find a way
to store a scsi_device ini i2o_dev and it becomes completely trivial.
Not sure about how to sanitize the scsi_devie probing logic
in i2o_scsi_probe yet.
