Hi,
  It's a while back, but now here's a patch that "works for me".
Once applied, we get a nice -EIO when doing a df / statfs() on a mounted 
FAT partition with removed media (without this would hang for minutes).
The change will affect anybody calling fat_access() (the cvf stuff, other 
fat-dependent modules).
Applies on 2.4.19 .. 2.4.22 for me.
Thanks,
- sda
