Hello!

Please, Alan, distinguish two things: "works" and "works, until
I ask X". The second is equal to "does not".
512 is maximal message size, which is transmitted without troubles,
hardwired to almost all the datagram protocols.

Sorry? It is bug in client mtu selection. Functions above are impossible
on fragmented packet even in theory. And because of A, if client uses mtu
296, it cannot use 100% of emerging and existing IP functions.

It is myth. Changing mtu until ~4K does not affect latency, it stays on 4K/bw.

Another myth. All they do error correction and have so high latency,
that _increasing_ mtu only helps. And helps a lot.
When you have 22Kbit link and 2 second latency, mtu must be large.

It is exactly, which we make, Alan. 8)

I repeat my reply: it is sillogism of A and B. See above.
You can write RFC yourself. 8)
