   1) Is it true that one cannot change the default ramdisk size
   without changing the source code if ramdisk was compiled as
   module? (The ramdisk_size boot parameter does not seem to work
   in this case).
If you load the ram disk as a module, then you have to to change the
default ramdisk size, you need to set the module rd_size.
   2) How do I free the ramdisk? Does kernel do it automatically?
   If so, what are the conditions for this? And what would be the
   consequences in the case of a large RAM disks (~100 MB)?
The the ramdisk will be freed when the ram disk module is unloaded.
Using the BLKFLSBUF ioctl as root will free the ramdisk if you want to
explicitly free the ramdisk without unloading the module.
