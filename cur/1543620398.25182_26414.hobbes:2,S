Not at all.  I really believe that embedded unnecessary information in
the kernel is a bad idea.  I don't want my kernels to get any bigger
than they are now unless useful features are being added (I have no
problem with that).  I develop for embedded devices, so I'm particularly
sensitive to this issue.
My understanding is that "keep features out of the kernel if possible"
is the majority opinion, not a crackpot weirdo stance.

I don't think this is a close enough analogy to illustrate anything.
The examples I chose to illustrate my points were IMHO closely related
software packaging issues.
