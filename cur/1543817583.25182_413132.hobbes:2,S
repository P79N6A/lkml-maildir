I guess so. Ideal solution would be to make all required allocations first,
then fail the build_sched_domains and fall back to the old structure. But
I guess that gets pretty complicated.
In reality (and after your patch 2/4), I don't think the page allocator will
ever fail any of these allocations. In that case, would it be simpler just
to add a __GFP_NOFAIL here and forget about it?
