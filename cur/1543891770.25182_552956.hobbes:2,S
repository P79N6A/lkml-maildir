Well, gettimeofday() is not affected by the highres code, but
> nanosleep({0, 0}, NULL) = 0
> nanosleep({0, 0}, NULL) = 0
is. The nanosleep call with a relative timeout of 0 returns immediately
with highres enabled, while it sleeps at least until the next tick
arrives when highres is off. Are there more of those stupid sleeps in
the code ?
