Do not forget to handle printk() done by fbdev driver... It
may invoke printk() from user context, but with console_semaphore
already held... Something like reentrant_semaphore? Also, we
should declare which console/fbdev function can printk/can schedule 
and which must not, as using interrupts & schedule could yield
CPU to other tasks when (hardware assisted) operation is performed.
Some of them (clear, bmove) can take loong time to finish.
