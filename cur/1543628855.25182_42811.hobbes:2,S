I'm having the same problems on dual PIII (VIA chipset) with addon
Promise IDE card:
Apr 24 19:34:51 atlas kernel: ide: unexpected interrupt 1 11
Lots of those...
Looks like it favors additional IDE interfaces. As system appears to
behave sanely, modulo flooded logs, I decided to comment the printk
for the time being.
Ingo, does it have anything to do with your interrupt balancing code?
If you need additional testing, let me know.
