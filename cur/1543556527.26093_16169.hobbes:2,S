Hi!
I have a problem with 2.2.17 + the latest ide patches and 2 * 61 gb ibm ide 
discs, the discs are connected as slave on a two channels (onboard ide 
channels on a asus p2b (i440BX Chipset)), there is nohing else connected on 
the ide interface and the jumper settings are identical.
dmesg output:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 21
PIIX4: chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

The difference in size and cylinders could cause a problem if this changes 
in later versions, is this normal behaviour or did i do something wrong ?
