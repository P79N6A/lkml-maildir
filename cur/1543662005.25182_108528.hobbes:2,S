Hi Alan,
Actually this problem started with ac2.  All seems to work well until I
reboot the machine with 'shutdown' or 'reboot' or 'ctl-alt-del'.
The machine shuts down properly to the point where all filesystems
are remounted readonly, which is the point where I normally see an
immediate reboot.  Starting with pre4-ac2 I just get an indefinite
hang instead of the reboot.
The terminal driver still seems to work because I can use the
ctl-alt-Fx keys to switch to other pseudo-terminals but the login
process is already gone so I can't actually do anything at the
login prompts.  It takes a hard reset to complete the reboot,
after which the machine comes up normally with clean filesystems.
I see this on three different machines with different motherboards
and CPU's [K6-2, athlon, athlon-xp], two VIA chipsets and one SiS.
No error messages print anywhere, so I'm not sure how to debug.
Do you need a kernel config file or dmesg output?
