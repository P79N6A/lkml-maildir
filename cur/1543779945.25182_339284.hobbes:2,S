What bug exactly?
I'm sometimes using kernels compiled with gcc 4.0 and without 
-fno-unit-at-a-time and except for the kernel image being smaller I 
haven't noticed any difference. Besides this, all architectures except 
i386 and um are not disabling unit-at-a-time.
There are a few parts of the kernel that might still have stack problems 
with unit-at-a-time, but I assume that's not what you are talking about?
