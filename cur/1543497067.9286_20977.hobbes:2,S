Alan,  Have tried bzImage and come up with a kernel size of 471K. Made the
necessary entries in lilo.conf and it still says 'kernel to big'.
Have pared down the kernel to just the basics, most everything is compiled
as modules.  Using ram disk/initrd for scsi stuff and ext2 in the
kernel itself, thats it!
This is just weird.  I had this problem with 5.2 some time back and don't
remember what the fix was.  
I see that the stock 2.2.5-15 kernel is 617K and lilo doesn't complain
about it.  Would a previous version of lilo fix this or is that pointless.
