Subject: [PATCH] ide_free_irq()

Simple patch. The current drivers/ide/ide.c calls free_irq() instead of
ide_free_irq(). We depend on these alternate routines to deal with our
semi-broken hardware, but since ide-probe.c calls ide_reqest_irq(), it
seems logical that this should also be ide_free_irq().
Thanks,
Will Jhun
