In a related note, I recently noticed that the `struct dirent` ,
/usr/include/direntry.h, contains a d_type field that is always
zero. This makes it necessary to make additional calls to lstat
to find out the nature of a file. This may be a 'C' library problem,
but defining '__USE_BSD' (see /usr/include/dirent.h) didn't fill
in the field. 
I wish that some of these little problems were fixed before potential
new ones are created.
Cheers,
