Hi,
when running oldconfig, I got to see some new IO delay questions,
and tried displaying its info using ?.
	IO delay type
	  1. port 0x80 based port-IO delay [recommended] (IO_DELAY_0X80) (NEW)
	> 2. port 0xed based port-IO delay (IO_DELAY_0XED) (NEW)
	  3. udelay based port-IO delay (IO_DELAY_UDELAY) (NEW)
	  4. no port-IO delay (IO_DELAY_NONE) (NEW)
	choice[1-4]: ?
	Sorry, no help available for this option yet.
The IO_DELAY_* "config" items have a help text, while the "choice" 
item does not.
Are there any plans on 'fixing' oldconfig to somehow tell me something 
about such new options?
thanks,
Jan
