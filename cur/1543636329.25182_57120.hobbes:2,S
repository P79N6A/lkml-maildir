While running 2.5.25-dj2 and dbench with increasing numbers of clients,
my test machine locked up with the following message:
kernel BUG at dcache.c:361!
I tried to copy down the following register dump but was unable to.
Nothing interesting saved in /var/log/messages.
This is fairly repeatable in that it happens with running dbench with
more than 32 clients.  I saw it once with as few as 6 clients.  After
getting weary of running fsck on an ext2 /home partition, I added a
journal to /home and mounted it as ext3.  With /home (where dbench is
running) mounted as ext3, I got the following message just before the
BUG:
EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,8): ext3_free_blocks: freeing blocks not in
datazone - block = 7939096, count = 13.
The test machine is a dual p3 1mb memory, scsi, 2.5.25-dj2 SMP kernel.
