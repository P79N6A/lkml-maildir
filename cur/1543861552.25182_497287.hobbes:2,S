No.  Simple "it happens a lot of times" is _not_ enough to establish
credibility of "it should be done that way".  It is a good reason to
research the rationale in each case.

And each instance either has a reason for doing it that way or is useless
or is a bug.  Reasons, where they actually exist, very likely are not
uniform.
Blind copying of patterns without understanding what and why they are
doing is a Very Bad Thing(tm).  That's how the bugs are created and
propagated, BTW.
