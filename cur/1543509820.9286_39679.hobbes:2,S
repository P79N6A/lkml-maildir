I have a cable modem running 2.2.11 with "pump" as my dhcp client, RH6.0...I
notice that every now and then the connection will seem to become super
slow...ping's to another computer on the network (the gateway) go up to
20000 ms...however, a tcpdump shows that the pings are returned immediately
and other computers on the network are fine (full speed)..apparently there
is something going on internally causing this slow down. What I do is bring
eth0 down and then run pump again, and then it works fine (i get 6 ms
pings)...for a while.
I'm running 2.2.11 SMP, the ethernet card is an NE2000 compatible PCI I
believe.
BTW, this doesn't ever seem to affect eth1, my lan.
