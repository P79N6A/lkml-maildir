That would be nice.  I used to have my own personal system and hacked version 
of klogd that had a /boot/kernels directory, but in it I still maintained the 
old (cumbersum) naming convention.  I *like* this idea.  A lot.
/boot/`uname -r`/{System.map,bzImage,.config}
So, what's it take to make it a "standard"?
