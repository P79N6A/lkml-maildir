Subject: 2.2.2 doesn't compile with CONFIG_FILTER

While trying to compile 2.2.2, I encountered the following error
message.  
  - <net/sock.h> fails to include <linux/filter.h>, which it needs for
    sk_run_filter and other.  This breaks loopback.c and ethertap.c (at least).
  - Various things refer to `struct sk_filter', but I can't find the
    definition anywhere in the source tree.  This is an untar of
    linux-2.2.2.tar.gz from an ftp.kernel.org mirror.  Am I half asleep
    or am I missing a file?
