The dropping of the lock in nbd_do_it is actually critical to the way 
nbd functions. nbd_do_it runs for the lifetime of the nbd device, so if 
nbd_do_it were holding some lock (BKL or otherwise), we'd have big problems.

Right, there's no problem in practice.

The problem with this patch is that no ioctls can come in once nbd_do_it 
starts because nbd_do_it runs for the lifetime of the device.
I think we really just need to add the acquiring of queue_lock in 
nbd_clear_que to your previous patch and leave it at that. I'll code 
that up and test it.
Thanks,
Paul
