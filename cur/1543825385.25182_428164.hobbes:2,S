I did, back when we had problems due to the blk_plug_lock being a global
one. I first wanted to investigate if plugging still made a difference,
otherwise we could've just ripped it out back than and the problem would
be solved. But it did get us about a 10% boost on normal SCSI drives
(don't think I tested MO drives at all), so it was fixed up.

Maybe I'm being dense, but I don't see a problem there. You _should_
call the new mapping sync page if it has been migrated.

splice never incs/decs any inode related reference counts, so if it
needs to then yes it's broken. Any references to kernel code that deals
with that?
