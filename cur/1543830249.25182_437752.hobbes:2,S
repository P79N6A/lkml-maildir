Subject: [PATCH 004 of 14] knfsd: Ignore ref_fh when crossing a mountpoint.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

nfsd tries to return to a client the same sort of filehandle as was
used by the client.  This removes some filehandle aliasing issues and
means that a server upgrade followed by a downgrade will not confused
clients not restarted during that time.
However when crossing a mountpoint, the filehandle used for one
filesystem doesn't provide any useful information on what sort of
filehandle should be used on the other, and can provide misleading
information.  So if the reference filehandle is on a different
filesystem to the one being generated, ignore it.
