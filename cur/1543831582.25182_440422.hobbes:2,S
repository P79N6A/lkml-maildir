The problem with this style is that it is an disoptimizatoin for 
architectures who hold their per-cpu data offset in a register, put the 
smp_processor_id in the per-cpu data (or similar) and per_cpu data 
offsets in a global lookup.
Do we need a new macro? (what is that gcc macro function syntax?)
#ifdef PER_CPU_IS_SLOW
#define my_cpu_var(bh_lrus, cpu) \
	({ BUG_ON(cpu != smp_processor_id()); 	&__get_cpu_var(bh_lrus); })
#else
#define my_cpu_var(bh_lrus, cpu) \
	({ BUG_ON(cpu != smp_processor_id()); per_cpu(bh_lrus, cpu); })
#endif
(and yes, the BUG_ON would be for debug checking).
