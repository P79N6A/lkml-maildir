Correct.

The web page I referred to in my posting suggested that the reimple-
mented TCP_V_C algorithm performed better in the presence of *delayed
ACKS* (ACK/NACK policy??). I take that to mean that the algorithm
uses a different method of transmit/retransmit control when ACK/NACK
link signals are time-delayed due to net.congestion.
Cardwell mentioned in his paper that a part of the improvement resulted
from  the use of usleep() for a more finely-grained timing algorithm.
Cardwell stated to the effect that a previous kernel implementation
of Reno-Vegas did not achieve its potential because of the rather
coarse granularirty of the 10ms (1 jiffy???) "clock tick" that was used....
I invite the interested reader to look at the paper which is published
at:
     
http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/cardwell/linux-vegas/
The (indirect) quote above appeared on the first page, IIRC.

Isn't Van-Jacobsen a header compression algorithm?

I'd like to try out your new code.   Anything to improve this
dial-up link would be a gift from heaven ;-)
Warm regards,
