No, this is not sufficient as I said in the last mail.  Why do you
completely ignore what others say.  The code which depends on the signal
does not have to have access to the event queue.  If a library sets up
an interrupt handler then it expect the signal to be delivered this way.
 In such situations ppoll etc allow the signal to be generally blocked
and enabled only and *ATOMICALLY* around the delays.  This is not
possible with the current wait interface.  We need this signal mask
interfaces and the appropriate setup code.
Being able to get signal notifications does not mean this is always the
way it can and must happen.
