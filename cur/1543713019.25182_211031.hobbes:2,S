Thank you, this tip was really useful.
Setting #define HPT_SERIALIZE_IO in hpt366.h solves the lockups on my
machine (ABIT KT7-RAID). There seems to be a small (10-20%) performance
penalty involved according to the benchmarks on my RAID1 setup, but that's
acceptable.
If this solves the "hdd led stays on" freezups for others with HPT370
(rev. 3) on motherboards with possibly buggy IRQ handling, then maybe this
option could even be made settable through kernel config, together with an
appropriate explanation.
