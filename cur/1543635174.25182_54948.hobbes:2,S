I know that, you're taking my response way too seriously :)
I just showed the typical response to one of your posts, you just picked
the wrong example, or maybe any USB example you could have picked would
have evicted much the same response :)

So you agree with me?  Good.  I know you think the code is better than
it was before, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, or in this
case, the eye of the people that fully understand the code :)
If nothing else, I hope you will think twice before sending off your
next BKL removel patch in a subsystem that you haven't fully tested or
understood.  That's the point I keep trying to get across here.
thanks,
