As far as I know - no branch prediction is invoked for a goto,
because the jump is unconditional - and fast.
Tidying up is generally a good thing, but make sure you don't
ruin any "fast-path" optimizations by doing so.
(That's where the common code path is a small place that fits in
the cpu cache, while all exceptional  cases are treated elsewhere.  Goto's
might be useful for doing that.
