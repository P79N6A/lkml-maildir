I have borrowed techniques from all over.  And I will go with whatever
works.  In this case I don't see why bootimg wasn't doing that.

1) You should have done proper video shutdown before you left the
   previous kernel.
2) You might not have a video card.
3) You might not have a working BIOS.
4) It is generally a very good idea to make a division of who controls
   what hardware.  And after the initial boot and the kernel has
   driven the hardware it isn't reliable to give control back to the
   BIOS.  We may have changed state enough to confuse the BIOS.
Or in summary it is generally unnecessary so why the heck are we doing
it.

O.k.  Any comments, on that interface?

O.k.  Given that I keep evolving this, that is understandable.  
Sorry about that.

O.k. cool.  I haven't really looked at that.

Version 2.0 is an early beta.  Some idiot yanked EM_486 and a couple
of other symbols out of elf.h from glibc.  Despite the ELF spec says
EM_486 at least should be there.  In any case that is just a debugging
bit and you can safely disable those.  Or do a make -k and compile the
kexec piece, but not the kparam, which isn't really relevant.
You have a newer version of glibc than I do.  For the next rev I will
supply my own elf.h.  The ABI at least is stable.
