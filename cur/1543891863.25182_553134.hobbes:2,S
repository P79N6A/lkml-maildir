Subject: default charset for linux-kernel code?

In private mail I have discussed with a person the default charset
to use for source code and in particular Kconfig files in the kernel.
I recall to have seen some mails about UTF-8 but I would like to have
confirmed what is the 'nofficial?' recommended charset for kernel code?
