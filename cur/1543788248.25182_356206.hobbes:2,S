Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch series should fix up lockups that people were seeing due to
improper spinlock placement (nested==bad).  Additionally, there are
other changes to simplify things (complex=bad).  The second patch adds
comment headers to functions that need it.
Thanks,
BR
