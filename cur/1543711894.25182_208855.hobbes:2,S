Subject: [DEAD BOX] Assert failure fs/jbd/transaction.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Got an assert failure while I was in X, and was unable to do anything
that'll hit disk (like run dmesg -- couldn't read dmesg in from disk).
Not sure what else was in the dmesg buffer.
handle_t *journal_start(journal_t *journal, int nblocks)
{
...
        if (handle) {
                J_ASSERT(handle->h_transaction->t_journal == journal);
                handle->h_ref++;
                return handle;
        }
This is against a bk pull of 2.6.4-rc1, somewhere around... 2004/03/02.
No idea how to trigger it.
Only file systems that use jbd are:
/dev/hda5 on / type ext3 (rw,data=journal,errors=remount-ro)
/dev/hda6 on /usr type ext3 (rw,nodev,data=journal)
/dev/hda7 on /home type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,data=journal)
Stuff that *might* have affected it:
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_XATTR=y
CONFIG_FS_MBCACHE=y
CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_REGPARM=y

(Yeah, that's a lot of stuff -- it gets to the login: prompt faster
 that way if everything I can rip out is a module, bootup decompression
 is obscenely slow on this system).
It's the first time I ever saw this error, so no idea how to trigger
it.  All disk access went dead.
