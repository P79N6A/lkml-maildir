The current usage under arch is pretty much bogus and they likely can't use 
dyntick anyway, so it would be easier to disable tick_nsec completely if 
dyntick is enabled.

We already have more than enough config options, where the user has barely any 
idea what to do, so we should try to configure and initialize as much as 
possible at runtime depending on what the hardware is capable of.
That reminds me that the main problem left for a dynamic variable is 
time_offset. It should become a 64 bit value, so SHIFT_UPDATE isn't needed 
anymore. Right now it depends on HZ to maximize the value range.

mult is not a constant and calculating the frequency like this is not very 
precise.
