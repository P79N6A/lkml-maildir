Subject: IDE CDROM drive not mount'ing (2.3.18ac2,ac3)

My IDE/ATAPI CDROM drive, correctly identified at boot time as:
hdc: NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:260, ATAPI CDROM drive
will not mount.  I have the current latest mount program (v2.9x).
IDE CDROM drivers, and isofs are compiled as modules, and they do
appear to be loading properly.
mount reports:
-------------
root@darkstar:~# mount /dev/hdc /mnt -t iso9660
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: Wrong medium type
The system log says:
-------------------
Sep 15 18:33:56 mdm-143-150 kernel: Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 3.03 
Sep 15 18:33:56 mdm-143-150 kernel: cdrom: pid 800 must open device O_NONBLOCK! 
Sep 15 18:33:56 mdm-143-150 kernel: cdrom: open failed.
Before any attempt to mount the drive, the eject button works
properly, after trying to mount (and getting the above failure),
the drive remains locked.
