    Peter,
	Maybe that's it.
	I ask the card which interrupt line it was given at boot-time:
	pci_read_config_byte(dev, PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE,
	                     &softp->interrupt_line);
	Then I request an IRQ:
	request_irq(softp->interrupt_line, sseintr, 
                    SA_INTERRUPT, "sse", softp);
	I don't know who exactly is assigning IRQ 217, and I don't know
	where I could read that value.
	Are you suggesting I should call request_irq(217, sseintr, 
                    SA_INTERRUPT, "sse", softp);
	Maybe you are on to the problem.
	I found out that if I boot with   "pci-noapic" that everyting
	works on the Sun machine!!!
