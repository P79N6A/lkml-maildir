Probably just, that I like to save life time.

That's no exploit. Where is the exploit?
http://www.google.com/search?q=jargon
%20exploit 
When you're there, you can look up the term ``backdoor'' as well.

Probably I'm missing the point, but at the moment this looks like a
chosen plain text attack. As you know for sure, this is trivial. For
instance, AES asserts to be secure against this kind of attack. (See the
author's definition of K-secure..).

The default mode of loop-AES' isn't compatible with anything out there.

I'm not aware of any ``ancient'' mount versions. util-linux 2.12 is not
designed to be compatible with anything. It's merely a low-level
interface, since the maintainer decided to omit hashing completely. My
patch enables the user to utilize external hash programs like hashalot. 
The compatibility code you're referring to is probably my patch for
hashalot. As you know, this has nothing to do with util-linux. If you're
not happy with hashalot, write your own external hasher, you can do that
thanks to my patch.
