Could it be the case, that it really doesn't support that
memory eventhough it claims to?

Did you try without High Memory support?

Try the "slow" memory and use a mem= boot option to tell the
Linux kernel not to use all of it.

I wonder if it could be the case, that it for some reason doesn't
use cache for all the memory.
