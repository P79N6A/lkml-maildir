The driver isn't able to autodetect which type of ESS chip you have, which
is why if you compile it as a module you can modprobe sb io=... irq=.
dma=. esstype=1879.  This will enable some mixer settings for you,
probably, but I don't think it will fix the incorrect speeds.

Interesting.  Look at this chunk of code:
(sb_ess.c:370)
	if (*speedp > 22000) {
		div = 0x80 | ess_calc_div (795500, 256, speedp, &diff);
	} else {
		div = 0x00 | ess_calc_div (397700, 128, speedp, &diff);
	}
I guess that's necessary on some cards and not others, or something.
Perhaps the first line should read if (*speedp > 22000 || submodel >= 1788)
or something.  I have no idea which chips do what, and evidently FKS isn't
too clear about that either.
