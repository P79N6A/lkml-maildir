  #define SNMP_INC_STATS_USER(mib, field) \
-	(per_cpu_ptr(mib[1], raw_smp_processor_id())->mibs[field]++)
+	do { \
+		per_cpu_ptr(mib[1], get_cpu())->mibs[field]++; \
+		put_cpu(); \
+	} while (0)
  #define SNMP_INC_STATS(mib, field) 	\
  	(per_cpu_ptr(mib[!in_softirq()], raw_smp_processor_id())->mibs[field]++)
