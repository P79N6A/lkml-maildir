Hmm - the old code seems to fail to e801 when CF was set too:
	int     $0x15                           # make the call
	jc      bail820                         # fall to e801 if it fails
	cmpl    $SMAP, %eax                     # check the return is `SMAP'
	jne     bail820                         # fall to e801 if it fails
Thats not to say that the old code was correct, mind you.  Failing on a
bad ID and returning without error on a set CF seems to be good to me.
