Btw, while simple in-band discovery of iSCSI exists, the standards based
IP storage deployments (iSCSI and iFCP) use iSNS (RFC-4171) for
discovery and network fabric management, for things like sending state
change notifications when a particular network portal is going away so
that the initiator can bring up a different communication patch to a
different network portal, etc.

Some of the points by Julo on the IPS TWG iSCSI vs. FCoE thread:
      * the network is limited in physical span and logical span (number
        of switches)
      * flow-control/congestion control is achieved with a mechanism
        adequate for a limited span network (credits). The packet loss
        rate is almost nil and that allows FCP to avoid using a
        transport (end-to-end) layer
      * FCP she switches are simple (addresses are local and the memory
        requirements cam be limited through the credit mechanism)
      * The credit mechanisms is highly unstable for large networks
        (check switch vendors planning docs for the network diameter
        limits) – the scaling argument
      * Ethernet has no credit mechanism and any mechanism with a
        similar effect increases the end point cost. Building a
        transport layer in the protocol stack has always been the
        preferred choice of the networking community – the community
        argument
      * The "performance penalty" of a complete protocol stack has
        always been overstated (and overrated). Advances in protocol
        stack implementation and finer tuning of the congestion control
        mechanisms make conventional TCP/IP performing well even at 10
        Gb/s and over. Moreover the multicore processors that become
        dominant on the computing scene have enough compute cycles
        available to make any "offloading" possible as a mere code
        restructuring exercise (see the stack reports from Intel, IBM
        etc.)
      * Building on a complete stack makes available a wealth of
        operational and management mechanisms built over the years by
        the networking community (routing, provisioning, security,
        service location etc.) – the community argument
      * Higher level storage access over an IP network is widely
        available and having both block and file served over the same
        connection with the same support and management structure is
        compelling– the community argument
      * Highly efficient networks are easy to build over IP with optimal
        (shortest path) routing while Layer 2 networks use bridging and
        are limited by the logical tree structure that bridges must
        follow. The effort to combine routers and bridges (rbridges) is
        promising to change that but it will take some time to finalize
        (and we don't know exactly how it will operate). Untill then the
        scale of Layer 2 network is going to seriously limited – the
        scaling argument
Perhaps it would be of worth to get some more linux-net guys in on the
discussion.  :-)
