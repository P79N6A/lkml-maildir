We have been trying to make this least intrusive and iiuc, extending
siginfo_t is not easy.

I think that should be fine.

Yes, but si_code from sys_rt_sigqueueinfo() cannot be trusted.  To be sure
we would have to check for "si_code < 0", but that would include cases like
SI_ASYNCIO which can come from interrupt/work-queues. which would require
more complex checks to safely compute namespace of sender.
IOW, we need to find the namespace of the sender only if the sender is
a user process. If signal is originating from kernel, safely checking
namespace becomes more complex.
Yes, current approach is somewhat hacky. We tried other approaches
before and they were either intrusive or required non-trivial changes
to semantics of signals to global init or both.

| What?
I assume your question is about the comment :-)
Yes, a process can see all its descendants and processes in descendant
namespaces. But it can only see its ancestors upto the most recent
CLONE_NEWPID. (kind of like chroot in filesystems). So if receiver
can't see sender, sender must be an ancestor.

Yes, its used in next patch.
