Actually, cvs has a parameter that lets you specify cutoff dates...
This is what I am suggesting that you do... Base this on my previous cvs 
instructions....
reminder: 
http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/How_to_build_from_CVS
so....
1st:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxtv.org:/cvs/video4linux login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxtv.org:/cvs/video4linux co v4l-dvb
cd v4l-dvb
make clean
make
make install
test
(you already did this - you said doesnt work)
Now, try again, using last month's code:
cvs up -D 2005-11-01
make clean
make
make install
did it work?  yes?  ok, so try two weeks later:
cvs up -D 2005-11-15
make clean
make
make install
... or no it didnt?  then another month earlier:
cvs up -D 2005-10-01
make clean
make
make install
works now?  try two weeks later:
cvs up -D 2005-10-15
make clean
make
make install
doesnt work?  1 week earlier:
cvs up -D 2005-10-07
make clean
make
make install
doesnt work?  1 day earlier:
cvs up -D 2005-10-06
make clean
make
make install
it works?  hmm... problem patch must have been committed between 10-06 
and 10-07
At that point, just give me the date and it will probably be easy to 
narrow it down, or then again, you can use time of day in the -D 
parameter too... (see man cvs)
anyway, you get the picture...  This is an adaptation for cvs based on 
Linus' description of the git bisection testing, and I'm sure that there 
are more efficient ways of doing it, but this should work.
Cheers,
Mike
