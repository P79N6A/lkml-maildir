I just remembered why I put in the software-visible Config Retry Status
code.  With conventional PCI, devices must return within something like
2^25 clock cycles (about a second for 33MHz busses).  PCIe devices can
return CRS to the root complex which will automatically retry -- but to
the CPU, this looks like a read that hasn't returned yet.
My concern was/is that devices which take a long time to initialise may
cause watchdog timers to fire.  I don't know if there's some CPUs which
might enter error recovery, but I think the native Linux watchdog might
well trigger.
Now, I have no evidence that this is going to happen.  And we definitely
have buggy hardware to contend with (that caused the initial reversion).
But the commit ad7edfe0490877864dc0312e5f3315ea37fc4b3a isn't as risk-free
as it might seem.
Would you accept a patch which just black-listed the bridge that was
causing problems?  Or possibly we don't even need that if we take Ivan's
patch to use conf1 accesses instead of mmconf for conventional config
space -- I understand the device in question to only have problems when
CRS is combined with mmconfig.
