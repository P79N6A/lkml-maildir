No need for anything in parallel.
I think you can trigger it by jumping to a non-PROT_EXEC page where
the target address is a prefetch -- or by falling through from the end
of a PROT_EXEC page to a non-PROT_EXEC one.
To be sure both cases are obscure, but the resulting loop is still wrong.
Who knows, perhaps internal conditions of the chip prevent these
particular prefetches from triggering the fault.  After all, we're
told that on returning from the fault handler, the prefetch won't
fault again, and it's not obvious why that should be.  It'd be very
subtle though, and deserve a comment.
