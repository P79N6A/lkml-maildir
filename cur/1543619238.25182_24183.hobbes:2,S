In general you are running into the ioctls are messy problem, and probably
need to be cleaned up.  Beyond that though ioctls should be static
they are part of the kernel ABI.  Though they aren't managed tight
enough that you can count on them being 100% static.

In general ioctls are not be subject to change.

Not that would be progress..
