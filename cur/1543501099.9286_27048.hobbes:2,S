Yes, but today's technologies last substantially longer than those of
years past.  If you maintain it, failures *are* less.  Part of
maintainence is bringing systems down for cleaning (yes, I said cleaning)
because dust acts as a blanket and does get into computers, and therefore
is the cause of many failures...
But *STILL*... even w/o cleaning, an abused system can reliably run for at
least 2 years, and that was back in 386 days.  With advancements in
technology, I'm sure that it's grown to longer than that.

99.9999% doesn't cut it?  Damn... I'd hate to be working with you...
