Agreed on desired behavior, but not on chroot sufficing.  It actually
sounds like you want exactly what was outlined in the OLS paper.
Users still need to be in a different mounts namespace from the admin
user so long as we consider the deluser and backup problems to be
legitimate problems (well, so long as user mounts are allowed).  So,
when they log in, pam gives them a new namespace and chroots them into
/share/$USER.
Assuming I'm thinking clearly  :)
