Then you should have noticed that drivers/char/mem.c is using PAGE_COPY.
Various architecture-dependent code is also using PAGE_foo macros.

I know why: back in those days, GCC emitted code for nested C
functions that assumed an executable stack.  Also, Linus wasn't
terribly eager to turn off execute-permission on data/stacks.  Even on
ia64 we started out that way, until I saw the error in my ways.

The reality is that whenever you introduce a globally visible name
that is not used on x86, there is a very definite risk that someone
will use that same name and cause a conflict.  We have had that happen
several times and that's the reason I'm normally religious about
prefixing all ia64-specific names with a "ia64_" or "IA64_" (yes, this
makes code a bit uglier, but you can't have it both ways).  Your
argument that the Alpha and other ports are doing something different
doesn't buy me anything.  If the ia64 break builds, the Alpha
maintainer won't fix it up for me, after all.
