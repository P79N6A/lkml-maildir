PCI seems to use __ide_unregister_hwif() directly. Case 2 and 3 seem to need 
the "retry until the device is unregistered" behaviour and case 1 seems to 
be compatible with that.
That suggests ide_unregister_hwif() could call itself back via a work queue 
until the device unregisters successfully. Anything that doesn't want this 
behaviour can use __ide_unregister_hwif() directly as PCI does?
