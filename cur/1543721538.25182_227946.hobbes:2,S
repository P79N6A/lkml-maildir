i think a forward port of netdump might already exist - Jeff, Dave?
i agree that netdump and diskdump should be merged. (Red Hat is involved
in the diskdump project too so this is an ultimate goal even though the
patches are divergent.) Basically diskdumping is another IO transport -
the format, userspace tools and much of the non-IO kernel mechanism is
shared. Diskdumping is more complex on the driver level and it also
needs to be more careful because it writes to media so it verifies
various assumptions by reading on-disk sectors before writing to the
area.
