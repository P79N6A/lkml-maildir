I'm seeing issues on a Dell Latitude C840 as well, but I'm not positive
it's the same bug(s).  The problem I'm seeing is that device renaming is
failing (I have up to 5 different ethernet-ish interfaces that can be
connected, so I abuse /sbin/nameif extensively. There seem to be some
other issues with pcmcia, but it's not clear what the problem is - it
manages to find the (normally down) ethernet on my Xircom card, but the
orinoco driver seems unable to find my wireless card....
For instance, under 2.6.18-rc6-mm2, I see:

Amazingly less chatty.  Much later, when /etc/rc5.d/S10network runs, we finally
see:
orinoco 0.15 (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au>, Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>, et al)
orinoco_cs 0.15 (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au>, Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>, et al)
but no output for the wireless configuring.
Unless somebody has a better idea overnight, I'll start a bisect of -rc7-mm1
in the morning...
