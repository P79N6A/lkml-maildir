How about the opposite?
If the page cache refault rate is way higher than the
anonymous refault rate, did you favor page cache?
Btw, just a higher fault rate will already make that
cache grow faster than the other, simply because it
will have more allocations than the other cache and
they both get shrunk to some degree...

Nope.  It is very hard to see the difference between mmapped
executables and mmapped data from any structure linked off
the struct page...
