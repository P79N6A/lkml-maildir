No ifdefs, this should be somewhere in the headers for the EFI supporting
architectures
But I suspect you could actually get away with just using asmlinkage
(after reviewing the ia64 asmlinkage I think it's ok)
x86-64 when it is ever implemented will always need asm stubs though
because it uses completely incompatible calling conventions.

I assume you have double checked it actually works? (i vaguely recall some
issues with applying attributes to typedefs). If not you would need
to put them to the declarations.
