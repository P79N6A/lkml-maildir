I think this should go in a separate e-mail (I sent another
about matroxfb).
2.6.0-test2 is the first 2.5.x I try, so I may be missing
something.
I have a Logitech PS/2 Wheel Optical (the blue, and probably
falsified) which works fine with 2.4.21. With 2.6.0-test2 I get
the following in the logs:
Jul 28 19:15:04 pervalidus /usr/sbin/gpm[83]: *** info [startup.c(150)]:
Jul 28 19:15:04 pervalidus /usr/sbin/gpm[83]: Started gpm successfully. Entered daemon mode.
Jul 28 19:15:04 pervalidus modprobe: FATAL: Module /dev/gpmctl not found.
Jul 28 19:15:04 pervalidus modprobe: FATAL: Module /dev/gpmctl not found.
Yes, /dev/gpmctl is missing. gpm is called with -m /dev/misc/psaux -t ps/2 -S "/sbin/shutdown -r -t30 +3:telinit 1:"
When I move it (I don't even press a button) it moves very fast
and may even execute the first -S command, what would require
pressing both buttons 3 times followed by the left. The same if
I killall gpm and use the mouse in XFree86. Then it starts rxvt
etc.
