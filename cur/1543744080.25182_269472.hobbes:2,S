This patch did the trick for me. I booted up my 2.6.8.1 kernel, did a
'bk pull' to get the code (Sunday Morning), and added in this patch. After
building and installing the patched kernel, I did another 'bk pull'
later and things worked fine. Consider me one more person to vouch for
this patch solving the OOM problem!
