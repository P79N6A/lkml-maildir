Hard to tell ;) 2.5.20's ext2 had 7 lock_super()s whereas for some reason
this patch adds 12...
I don't recall whether ext2 suffered wild context switches as badly as ext3
did.  It becomes pretty obvious in testing.
The really bad workload was SDET, which isn't available to mortals.  So
some hunting might be neded to find a suitable alternative.  dbench would be
a good start I guess.
