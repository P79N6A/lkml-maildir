Hmm, looking at the posix spec (do we follow POSIX for mmap?) the
behaviour of MAP_PRIVATE mappings when the underlying file is modified
is unspecified.
I guess missing the cache handling for such mappings fits the POSIX
spec, and is equally as yucky as the current behaviour on CPUs which
don't require these flushes.
(unless someone tells me that POSIX is on drugs, I'm not going to be
that bothered about the MAP_PRIVATE case.)
