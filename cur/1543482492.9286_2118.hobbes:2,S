Hi, folks!
make xconfig produces some rather odd results for me:  for one, under
"Mice" appears QIC-02 Tape Support and Watchdog Timer.  I strongly suspect
that's not where they're supposed to be.  Either I patched up wrong 
(successively from 2.1.132, with a couple of AC patches backed in and out
since) or config.in and/or xconfig is broken.  I haven't looked at the other
config options to see.
Somebody want to take a look at this?  I'd imagine it would be slightly 
embarassing for end users to go wandering looking for either of these
features, and find them under "Mice".
