The slab layer in the kernel is an algorithm that attempts to reserve a sane 
amount of memory for a given highly-used data structure in the kernel. By 
using the slab layer to keep memory reserved and ready, performance-critical 
sections of the kernel code (say, code that receives a packet) doesn't have 
to stop and succeed an allocation before continuing.
