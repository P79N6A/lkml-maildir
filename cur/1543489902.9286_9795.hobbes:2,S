I guess these are considered `trivial' but various rendering
applications scale very well this way. I've done it under linux using
POV-Ray and under IRIX across multiple-Onyx boxes when rendering with
various applications.
Obviously, such programs, which can almost totally disassociate large
parts of themselves (in this case separate frames or regions) can
scale in such ways extremely well...

I'm guessing s/he meant that any page on memory was only mapped on
one machine at any time.

Making things easier for the programmer usually doesn't make better
code, applications or help performance. In fact, I would argue the
opposite is true.
