Dave (Airlie), this is an oops first reported at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/30/9
mga_freelist_get() is inlined at its only callsite mga_dma_get_buffers()
that is in turn inlined at its only callsite in mga_dma_buffers(). This
oops was hit ...
static struct drm_buf *mga_freelist_get(struct drm_device * dev)
{
	...
	head = MGA_READ(MGA_PRIMADDRESS); <=== ... HERE.
	...
}
MGA_READ() is DRM_READ32(), and dev_priv->mmio was found to be NULL when
trying to access dev_priv->mmio->handle as shown above.

As you already know by now, this oops isn't a bug or anything in the
scheduler at all, but more likely a race in the DRM itself (which possibly
could have been exposed by some aspect of CFS). So it makes sense to
"withdraw" this as a CFS-related bug report, but definitely not as a DRM-
related bug report.
