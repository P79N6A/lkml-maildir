Well.  If Linus decides to remove devfs, I certainly won't weep for it.
However, I don't see any signs of that happening right now, and cleaned
interface is less PITA than what we have in the current tree.  Right now
I'm mostly interested in making the glue in drivers simpler and less
intrusive.  The fact that it leads to less/simpler code in devfs proper
is also a Good Thing(tm)...
