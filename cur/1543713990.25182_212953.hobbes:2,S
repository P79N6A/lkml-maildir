I was sold a Promise PDC 20375 IDE Controller for use with
a parallel ATA drive today. The guy said that Linux just started to
support it. However, I can only find 202xx related drivers in the
kernel, and they do not detect the 20375 controller.
Can I use this controller with Linux, or should I return it?
Thanks,
