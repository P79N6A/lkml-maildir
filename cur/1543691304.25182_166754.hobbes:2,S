This message shouldn't prevent the new modules from being installed.
This comes from `depmod` which is creating /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/modules.dep. When you boot the new kernel, the boot-script
will (probably) execute `depmod -a`, fixing the problem. Your
new kernel probably has unlock_page exported. The older one
probably didn't.
Tty it. It should work okay.
Cheers,
