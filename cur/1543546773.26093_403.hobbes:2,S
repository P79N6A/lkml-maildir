FYO, it's not a recent change.  It was done probably about a year
ago or more (around the beginnings of 2.3 iirc), and there was more
reason back then to leave it there than there is now.
There's nothing stopping you from cleaning it up.  The only problem I
see now is whether Linus will accept "the correct" cleanup given that
it will potentially affect a large number of drivers.
