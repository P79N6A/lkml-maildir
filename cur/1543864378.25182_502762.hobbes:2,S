I have noticed that vger seems to be truncating Cc lists lately, often 
resulting in broken partial email addresses in the Cc list causing 
people that reply to have copies of the message bounced back instead of 
being delivered to the intended recipients.  It seems that it munges 
long, multi line Cc headers into one line, and truncates that line to a 
maximum length.  Who is the list admin again?  And can they look into this?
