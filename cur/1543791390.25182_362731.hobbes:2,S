It's not only for sparse.
The -Wmissing-prototypes flag to gcc gives similar warnings, and I'm 
also cleaning up code for adding this flag to the CFLAGS.
Why?
It sometimes happens that the signature of a function changes and it is 
forgotten to update all prototypes.
If the prototype is in a header file, gcc tells about the mistake.
If the prototype is in the C file gcc can't help us and it might take 
some time until someone tracks the source of the nasty runtime problems 
this might cause.
It's your choice as subsystem maintainer which header file the 
prototypes should go into - it is only important that both the file with 
the actual function and all users of this function #include this header.
