209 fairly simple lines definitely have more appear than a full
in-kernel implementation with many new corner-cases, yes.  But it
looks as if you ignore the -ENOSPC case, so you cheated a little. ;)
No matter how you try, there is no way around an additional return
code for open(), so we have to break compatibility anyway.  The good
news is that a) people not using this feature won't notice and b) all
programs I tried so far can deal with the problem.  Vim even has a
decent error message - as if my patch was anticipated already.
