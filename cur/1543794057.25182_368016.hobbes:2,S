No problem.

Check the usleep() manpage:
This function is obsolete. Use nanosleep(2) or setitimer(2) instead.
And in any case, I think usleep() just ends up calling nanosleep()?
It's not a sys-call in an of itself, like sys_nanosleep().

Well, your general resolution also was improved quite a bit in 2.6
(HZ=1000 vs. HZ=100 is a 10-fold improvement). But I agree, is a big
difference if you depend on that udelay() functionality -- but it was
a delay of up to 2 milliseconds, which is generally frowned upon in
the kernel.

Not sure, but I think the only requirement is that we don't return
early (i.e. request 2 milliseconds, return in 1 millisecond).
