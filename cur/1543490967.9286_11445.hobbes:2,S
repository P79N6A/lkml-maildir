I'm having the same problem with pristine 2.2.4. Also with amd (latest
am-utils package from redhat, other places may have newer ones).
I tried to add anouther amd mount point but got the configuration file
wrong at the first try. So amd had 1 working and 1 nonworking mount
point (mount point type parameter was wrong in my conf. file). And when
I tell amd to stop (via /etc/rc.d/init.d/amd stop), the process just
hangs. It's sitting there right now: 2 processes in rpc_execute, one amd
and one shell script to unload amd. And syslog says
nfs: task 13820 can't get a request slot
So probably amd messed something up and the nfs client can't talk to
amd. The message seems to be a only consequence of the amd problem and
the real problem is probably the hanging amd.
