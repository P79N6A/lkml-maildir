Yes, and we would very much like to see it in the mainstream kernel, 
rather than an mm branch.   It is perfectly acceptable to turn off the 
namespace features and trim anything else that might introduce 
incompatibility or instability.  Our goal is to ship it as an advanced 
but integrated feature, i.e., we do not want to ship two kernels and/or 
lose other features such as bootsplash, software suspend, etc.
