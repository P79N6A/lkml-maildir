It happened again 2 times here, then I've opened the case and done a
"cleanup". I've also switched the power cable of the disk.
After that it isn't happened anymore.
When it happened I think I've heard a small "beep", like a small power
"failure" that made it powering off/on in a fraction of second.
(Is that plausible?)
So maybe mine was an "hardware" problem followed by the software unable
to get the disk to behave correctly... or something.
Another interesting thing is that the disk preserves his state of
brokenness across a reboot... I need a full power OFF/ON to get it back.
I hope to never see this again :)
