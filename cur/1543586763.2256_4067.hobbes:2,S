I have mozilla stuck in D state:
25 [16:44:06] bowman@europa:/home/bowman>> ps -eo pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan | grep mozilla
  435 ?        bowman   mozilla-     - 040 down_write_failed
 2646 ?        bowman   mozilla-     - 040 down_write_failed
Would this be a mozilla issue or a kernel issue? I can't kill this sucker
nor can I attache an strace to it and have it return something.
System is a Debian 2.2r2 system, kernel 2.4.3-ac2, glibc 2.1.3
(dunno what else you folks may need - if you do need more info, 
holler)
