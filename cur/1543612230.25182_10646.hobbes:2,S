Yes, I noticed that. This is why we are trying to find a different method for 
walking the gendisk list. :)

Sounds good. Any chance you could just leave out the partitioning stuff and 
let EVMS handle it?

Agreed, they are ugly. I didn't really write them to try to get them accepted 
or anything, just to generate some discussion.
I must have missed your walk_gendisk() patch the last time (do you remember 
how long ago you posted that?). It looks like it should accomplish just what 
we need for discovery, and provide the correct locking. Of course, Ram is 
gong to shoot me now, since I believe he suggested something like this 
earlier today. :)
We will go with the walk_gendisk() method, and add your genhd.c and genhd.h 
patches to our set of patches for EVMS.
