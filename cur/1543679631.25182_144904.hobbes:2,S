Sorry about BW. Anybody know how to configure a cable modem?
I have one. I connect it to the cable. I set Linux up for
DHCP. I end up with a dynamic IP address, a network mask,
a broadcast address, a default route, and even a name-server.
I can ping the name-server. However, I can't telnet or use
a Web Crawler. The thing works fine with WIN/2000/Prof. The
ISP says they only support Windows. Since I have all the
"hooks" working, how do I find a default route that will
route my packets to bypass their stuff?
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
