Interesting.
Do you know if Dave's patch supports sharing of pte's for 2 MB pages on 
X86_64?
Was there a corresponding improvement in overall transaction throughput for 
the hugetlb, shared pte case?    That is, did the 3% improvement in CPI 
translate to a measurable improvement in the overall OLTP benchmark score?
(I'm assuming your 25-50% improvement measurements, as mentioned in a previous 
note, was for small pages.)
