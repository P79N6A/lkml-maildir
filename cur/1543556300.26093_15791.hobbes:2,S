You are right.  An overnight diskthrash with the above patch didn't
oops, but it turned up three instances of the EXT2 directory warnings.
Incidentally, there's something wrong in blockdev/VM land. The
overnight run consisted of:
- one looping instance of `dbench 4 ; sleep 120'
- one looping instance of 'lmbench ; sleep 120'
- one looping instance of `bonnie++ ; sleep 120'
- one looping instance of `mmap001;mmap002;misc001;sleep 120'
Things which went wrong (after ten hours):
- the first dbench run never completed.
- the first bonnie++ run never completed.
- I then killed everything with ALT-SYSRQ-T.  It's been 20 minutes
  now and the disk LED is *still* hard on.  This machine has 256 megs
  and the hdparm disk bandwidth is 20 megs/sec.
You can observe the latter problem pretty easily by running `misc001' on
its own.  Kill it after 20 seconds and the disk remains active for *ages*.
Usually ninety seconds.  Long enough to write all physical memory out
ten times...

Okay, will test.  (25 minutes now.  It's fsck time...)
