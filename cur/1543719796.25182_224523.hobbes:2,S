Hmmm, I see more data to maintain to support a method that will never be 
even close to be perfect. How the thing works with callback triggered 
loops for example, where a function is not directly called, but instead is 
passed to another function (that maybe pass it to another function) that 
triggers the call. Or maybe it's another set of functions that might 
trigger the call (think about all *_operations for example). Eg, there's 
an evident loop possibility in epoll (triggered by callback'd wakeups) 
that is not in the list, and it's pretty hard to detect. Doing stack usage 
analisys from the source code is not easy, once you abbandon the trivial 
direct call scenario.
