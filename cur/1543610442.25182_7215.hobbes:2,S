I'm confused by conflicting rumors about VIA 686B chipset:
    - some people can get only 3 x DIMM working at PC-133.
    - others report that all 4 x DIMM are working at PC-133.
It's interesting to note that specs for
    - Tyan's motherboards say support for only 3 x DIMM at PC-133,
    - Abit's motherboards say support for all 4 x DIMM at PC-133,
But, they both use same VIA 694X/686B chipsets.
Which is correct?
