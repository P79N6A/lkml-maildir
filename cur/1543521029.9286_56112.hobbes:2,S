Have a look at 
http://www.fornax.sk/medusa/
It's another project dealing with kind of securety you talk about.
IMHO it's quite advanced. Uses an userspace daemon to talk to a
special device, /dev/medusa, where kernel places it's questions, and the
daemon (constable) answers whether allow, not allow, or silently forbid
the operation.
It's big advantage is the userspace daemon, which is "independent" of the
kernel patches. So you may design your own.
It handles file manipulation, aswell as network functions, setuid and
such.
Well, 'nough said, have a look your self.
Others are welcome!
