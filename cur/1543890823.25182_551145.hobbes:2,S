sendfile() interface doesnt allow it, but if you open("somediskfile", O_RDONLY 
| O_NONBLOCK), then splice() based sendfile() can perform a non blocking disk 
io, (while starting an io with readahead)
I actually use this trick myself :)
(splice(disk -> pipe, NONBLOCK), splice(pipe -> worker))
non blocking disk io, + zero copy :)
