Not necessarily.  Re-read what Signed-off-by: is all about and who
may provide that line.  You should find that the first Signed-off-by:
line may not be the author themselves, but someone else who is able
to satisfy our requirements.
I think people will just have to accept that there's no way to _always_
_automatically_ get the proper author for every patch. (and that calling
it author in git was probably the first mistake - we never had these
issues with BK which didn't specifically indentify anything as being
the "author" as such.)
