Results with 2.6.8-rc2-M5:
Configuration						max usecs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
All IRQs threaded					370 
Soundcard IRQ not threaded				335
Soundcard IRQ not threaded + max_sectors_kb -> 64	161
So, it looks like the added configurability does add some overhead - 161
usecs vs. 50.  mm1 is significantly better than the stock kernel.  The
above results imply that 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 with the irq.c hack would be
frighteningly good.
