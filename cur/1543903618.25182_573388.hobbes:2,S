Ever heard of the halting problem? :)  It's not just a matter of
infrastructure.  You very quickly get into questions that are
mathematically undecideable.

But how would that help?  If task B holds the lock, then we can't
freeze it until it's released the lock.  Then the question is, what
does task B need in order to get to the point where it releases the
lock?  And so on.  It rapidly gets not just extremely messy, but
actually impossible to compute in general.
