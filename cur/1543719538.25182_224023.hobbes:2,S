This confirms that eth1 is a 21041 driven by the de2104x driver.
I've seen something very similar to Casey's problem, on a PowerMac
with a built-in 21041. Booting it with no network cable connected
causes a timer to hit a BUG() in de2104x about a second after
the device is ifup:d.
The 2.4 kernel's tulip driver works just fine.
I reported this last year, but nothing happened.
A workaround is to use the de4x5 driver instead.
