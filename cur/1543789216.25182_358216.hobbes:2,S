yup, now the question is wether PG_Dirty will be visible to CPU 2 before
the page count is decremented right ? That depends on put_page, I
suppose. If it's doing a simple atomic, there is an issue. But atomics
with return has been so often abused as locks that they may have been
implemented with a barrier... (On ppc64, it will do an eieio, thus I
think it should be ok).
There is also a problem the other way around. Write to page, then set
page dirty... those writes may be visible to CPU 2 (that is the page
content be dirty) before find_get_page even increased the page count,
unless there is a barrier in there too.
Paul, Anton ?
Ben.
