Subject: [PATCH] schedule() in_atomic() fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Attached patch fixes the scheduler in_atomic() problem with kernel
preemption enabled (and is also working - when kernel preemption is on,
it finds a couple issues during boot).
I hope this approach is to your liking.
Patch is against current BK, please apply.
	Robert Love
