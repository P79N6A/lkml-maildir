That's odd since there isn't much difference, if any, between the i2c
subsystems of all three kernel versions.
You could try 2.6.8-rc1-bk4 (or any later bk) which has had a significant
i2c subsystem update.
If you are able to reproduce the problem (presumably with your 2.6.8-rc1
kernel), hints about where the problem lies would help. Can you see the
sysfs files for your monitoring chip under /sys/bus/i2c/devices? Are
there any relevant error messages in the logs? I cannot help much from
just "it didn't work", as you must realize.
Both the via686 and the Winbond 697hf are ISA chips, not really I2C
(although they share the same subsystem) so it is possible that the
problem was caused by a conflict with, say, ACPI or PNP, which could
have reserved resources (namely I/O addresses) needed by the hardware
monitoring chip(s).
As a side note, I'd be quite surprised that you have both chips on the
same motherboard.
Hope that helps,
