Ok,.. as this is obviously not FAT32 related (just tested the whole
stuff on ext3) I'll open a new thread to hopefully attract more people

btw: right now I'm going to try the whole thing with the edac_mc with
ECC for K8.
mcelog did not return anything at all (just silently quitted).
Thanks so far and regards,
Chris.
