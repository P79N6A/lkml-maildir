Well, that sounds ok, but it maybe the case that the SES
device wants to say something about the SAS devices
on the same level.  So even if userspace gets it, it would
have nothing to do with it, because of the _type_ of SES
device/event/etc.
(User space can be notified anyway, which is perfectly fine).
