I know. I already have to deal with API breakages.
Changing transfer function prototype may be a tiny speed improvement for one
implementation that happens to use unoptimal API, but at same time be tiny
speed degration to other implementations that use more saner APIs. I am
unhappy with that change, because I happen to maintain four such transfers
that would be subject to tiny speed degration.
