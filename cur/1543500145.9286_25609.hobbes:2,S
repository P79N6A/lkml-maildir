Very true.

It allready is in 3 branches.

The kernel has allready done this for as long as I can remember.
Look in the "testing" directory of any mirror to get the "beta"'s
of as-yet-unreleased kernels.  They exist for both stable and
devel kernels, so in fact there are 4 things going on.

You haven't said anything that can't allready be done IMHO.
Perhaps you weren't aware of the 'pre' releases or where to get
them.  We also have the 'ac' patches, as well as 'arca'
releases...
