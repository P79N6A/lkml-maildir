Having the top header take up yet another line is probably
not a good idea, but I guess we could get rid of the 'shared'
stat by 2.6 time and inactive_clean/target can also be gotten
rid of.
On the other hand, this might start breaking all kinds of
scripts left and right, so we need to be careful with that...

Rik
