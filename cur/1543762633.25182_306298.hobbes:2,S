Hmm, in that case it could be just a problem with that BUG_ON() -
it wasn't there before... but it seems like a very useful test,
especially with all this new work going on, so it would be a shame
not to run it in releases.
But I don't quite understand (should really look at the code more),
how come you aren't leaking memory? Do _all_ processes share this
same first L1 page table? If so, can it be allocated with a more
specialised function? If not, can nr_ptes be decremented in the
place where it is freed?
/me goes to bed now - I'll have a bit of a look tomorrow.
