Simple truths. Like always you need to add your common sense though.
I just contend that it's not always the right thing to try to clamp
what's a simple ioctl into a complicated file system. From Joe's description
of the fs interface it sounds to me like the ioctls are a lot simpler
than the fs based version. KISS principle applies.
