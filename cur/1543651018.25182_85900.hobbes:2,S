Yes.

It allows get_user_pages() to work correctly across hugepage
regions.  It walks a chunk of memory which is covered by
hugepages and installs (at *pages) the list of 4k-pages which
are covered by the hugepage.  So
 |--------------------------------------------------|  <- hugepage
 |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|  <- 4k pages
 get_user_pages(   ^here                   ^to here)
 will install the spanned 4k pages into the caller's pages[]
 array.

I suggest that you restructure get_user_pages thusly:
1: Write a simplified get_user_page().  Most callers of get_user_pages()
   only want a single page anyway, and don't need to concoct all those
   arguments.
2: Split get_user_pages up into a pagetable walker and a callback function.
   So it walks the pages, calling back to the caller's callback function
   for each page with
	(*callback)(struct page *page, <other stuff>, void *callerdata);
   You'll need to extend follow_hugetlb_page() to take the callback
   info and to perform the callbacks for its pages as well.
3: Reimplement the current get_user_pages() using the core engine from 2
   (ie: write the callback for it)
4: Implement your sg engine using the walker+callback arrangement.  This
   way, you can do your coalescing on-the-fly, and you only take one
   pass across the pages list and you do not need to know about hugepages
   at all.   Sure you'll do a *little* more work than you need to,  but
   not having that special case is nicer.
5: Fix up the ia64 follow_hugetlb_page too.
