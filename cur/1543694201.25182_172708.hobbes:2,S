Thank you.

dd if=/dev/hda8 of=/dev/null already quit at the bad sector.  It's really
certain that that one sector is it, and I won't be able to read anything
from it.  The read check should just be a redundant check that the correct
sector is being addressed there, and it is a good idea to do that.

I made a shell script with find commands to copy all files that are in that
partition (all pathnames that aren't in other mounted filesystems) to
/dev/null.  When one aborts, I should know the name.  But this is an
incredibly inefficient way to do it.  Intuitively it seems it should be
straightforward to find at least one of the pathnames that the file has.
Practically it seems it shouldn't take 24 hours to copy all files in a 5GB
partition to /dev/null.  But after several hours it only copied about 20% of
the files to /dev/null, and I'll have to continue it this weekend.  Even the
drive's "long" S.M.A.R.T. self-test only took 47 minutes.
