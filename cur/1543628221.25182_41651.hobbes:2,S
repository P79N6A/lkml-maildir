Indeed. The source code reference in th Configuration documentation is very 
much out of data and completely broken for anything that requires 64 bit 
sizes on a 32 bit architecture.
This is all fixed now (I know because I shared your frustration and went 
and fixed it myself (-:), if you want to get a properly working version 
which exhibits no problems under very intensive i/o on a 15GiB partition 
over a 100MBit lan just go to 
http://sf.net/projects/nbd/
 and get the 
latest version from CVS or download the new 2.0 release tarball.

I haven't tried RAID... Interesting idea though.

Yes, I had that impression, too. I hope I made the parts I touched look a 
bit better. (-8

Simillar here on server side (2.4.18-pre7-ac2+misc patches).

nbd is also actively developed. The only problem is nobody has bothered to 
update the kernel documentation to point to the website where development 
happens. )-:
While we are here, I will make patches for 2.4 and 2.5 in a minute and 
submit them...
