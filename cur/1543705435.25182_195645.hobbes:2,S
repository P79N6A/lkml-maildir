Well, I was discussing it today with a colleague and I think his arguments 
are convincing (citation from memory):
"From the point of a kernel developer and kernel internal programming 
it might be better to put it under Input, but the kernel configuration 
interface is written mostly for end-users who might/will not know about 
kernel internals, so most people will expect this option under Sound."
Would it be so bad to put it to Drivers->Sound->Misc->PC-Speaker?
Thanks,
