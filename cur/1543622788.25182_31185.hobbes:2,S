Hi Florin, hi Alan,

I can reproduce this too on ext2, so this does not seem to be FS related. 
However, I do not get this error messages, the patch runs just fine,
but corrupts all files it touches, leaving them to be all a bit less than 
1MiB of size, and all exactly the same size.
There is no filesystem corruption however, e2fsck runs just fine without any 
error. Just the files are all damaged. I looked inside them, and it seems 
huge parts of other files from the patch have been "attached" to them.

ACK, for me too; as well as 2.4.18-rc2-ac2 for me. The breakage starts with
2.4.18-ac1 here.  Plain 2.4.18 from Marcelo works fine as well.
Greetings,
Andreas
