in a nutshell ...
the idea is to try and generalize these things
your approach involves tweaking each end solution to maximize the performance
our approach is to teach the kernel some more tricks so that each
solution need not be tweaked
these are at obvious odds as they tackle the problem by going in
pretty much opposite directions ... yours leads to a tighter system in
the end, but ours leads to much more rapid development and deployment
