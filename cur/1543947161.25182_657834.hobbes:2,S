Thanks for the info. I guess I missed that from the code. In any case that seems like a 
pretty heavy refcounting mechanism. In a sense that every time something is loaded or 
unloaded entire machine freezes, potentially for several milliseconds. Normally it's not a 
big deal. But once you get more and more CPUs and/or start using realtime apps this becomes
a big deal. And it's plain broken for the use case that I mentioned during CPU isolation 
discussions. ie When user-space thread(s) prevent stopmachine kthread from running, in which
case machine simply hangs until those user-space threads exit.
Initially I assumed that it had to do with subsystems registration/unregistration being
potentially unsafe if it's only for module ref counting there is gotta be a less expensive way.
I'll think some more about it.

Got it.
Thanks again for the explanation. I'll stare at the module code some more with what you said
in mind.
