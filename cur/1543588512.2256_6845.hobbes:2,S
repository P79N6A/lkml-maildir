Right.  This is expected (and defined) behaviour.  But do you have
_any_ example where this is used for fds > 2?  I can't remember.
And IMHO that would be pretty fragile too.  Shell scripts sometimes
open temporary fds > 2 and these are passed to called programs.  I.e.
#!/bin/sh
exec 3>log
echo >&3 "script started"
ls /proc/self/fd              # gets fd3 already opened
ls /proc/self/fd 4</dev/null  # now 3 and 4 already in use...
# or look into any configure script...
So, IMHO as long as some library does not mess with fds 0, 1, and 2
it should be ok [1].  Yes, it would be against the standard but I
still have to find some code where this semantic is used for fds > 2.
Ciao, ET.
PS: I would prefer to keep the standard semantics but the reasons
for that are pretty weak ... ;-)
PPS: Even your sample code is fragile.  It breaks if I start it
with  ./a.out <&-  ;-)  (the close(0) is likely to close one end
of the pipe)
[1] Unintentionally setting the controlling tty may be a problem.
