ChangeSet 1.2045, 2005/03/09 09:52:29-08:00, Michael.Waychison@Sun.COM
[PATCH] driver core: clean driver unload
Get rid of semaphore abuse by converting device_driver->unload_sem
semaphore to device_driver->unloaded completion.
This should get rid of any confusion as well as save a few bytes in the
process.
