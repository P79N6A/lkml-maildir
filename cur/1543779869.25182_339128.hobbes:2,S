The exports(5) man page says fsid=num is necessary for filesystems on
non-block devices - I don't know whether this includes loopback
filesystems.  Have you tried exporting a Squashfs filesystem mounted
on a real block device?
I've never tried to export a Squashfs filesystem, and so I don't know
if it works.  If it doesn't, I would say it is because Squashfs (like
Cramfs) doesn't store correct nlink information for directories.
The next release does store nlink information, has support for > 4GB
files/filesystems, and other nice improvements.  I'm hoping to release
an alpha release soon.
