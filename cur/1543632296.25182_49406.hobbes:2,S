This isn't going to be much of a bug report :-(.  Attempting to boot
2.5.19 with "vga = 791" in /etc/lilo.conf hangs with a blank black
screen right at the point where the display attempts to switch video
modes.  Works fine for 2.5.18 and prior kernels.  Booting 2.5.19 in
standard 80x25 text mode works fine also.
