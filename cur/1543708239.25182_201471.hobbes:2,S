Ok, we now have the InfiniBand Access Layer (IBAL) integrated and
building in 
the 2.6.3 environment and have a patch that we can provide. We have not
yet 
fixed the issues that you have raised so far (such as the abstraction
layer), 
but wanted to submit the code so that we can get additional 
feedback from you and all of the community, as you requested. 
Would you like me to submit the patch directly to linux-kernel email
list ? 
I have also posted it to the InfiniBand sourceforge website at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infiniband
