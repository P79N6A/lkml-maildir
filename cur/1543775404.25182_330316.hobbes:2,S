You say
  "If a sysadmin trusts the users enough, or can ensure through other
   measures, that system processes will never enter non-privileged mounts,
   it can relax the last limitation with a "user_allow_other" config
   option.  If this config option is set, the mounting user can add the
   "allow_other" mount option which disables the check for other users'
   processes."
What config option, where?
