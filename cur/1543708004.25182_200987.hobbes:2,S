To be fair, your subject should say that 
   SW RAID5 + high memory + loop device freezes 2.6.3 kernel
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Would you be able to try the same tes without using "loop" in the
middle and see what happens?
The trace you sent:

seems to suggest that %esi is being dereferenced at make_request+0x5,
but when I disassemble my raid5.o, it doesn't.
I tried disassembling the code:

but that just produced nonsense.
Could you 
   gdb raid5.o
   disassemble make_request
and send me the output please.
