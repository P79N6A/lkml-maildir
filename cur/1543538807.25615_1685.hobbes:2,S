This came up about a year ago. From what I remember, it was determined
that pipes are not supposed to generate signals when data are available
because you can't even write to a pipe unless you have a reader already
reading. Basically, the pipe will block on a write until somebody
reads it and a reader will block until somebody writes. Attempts to
set the pipes to non-blocking violates some spec (perhaps POSIX) so
the result is undefined.
This was what was explained to me when I reported what I thought was a
bug. You need to use UNIX Sockets for interprocess communication
instead of pipes if you want signals for synchronization. Sockets
produce the behavior you expect.
