If You'd readed the patch probably We can stop about speaking about cache
misses of the patch itself, and we're speaking about the real question that can
makes the patch die.
Can We admit such RQ loads in Linux, or We can say that in the rare cases
that shows this behaviour We can tollerate a non optimal scheduler response ?
Even if I've received mail from guys that has servers with RQ > 30, and as I've
stated into the opening message of this thread ( four question marks ), I'm all
but sure about the convenience of merging the patch itself.
"Kernel code bloat" vs. "Uman loads gain"  :  1 - 0
This is a good reject point.
Not about speaking of "great cache trashing", etc.. that the patch itself don't
have.

With high loads I've ever meant high number of tasks in RQ ( since I'm
measuring scheduling times versus RQ length ), so for that it counts it's true.

100 % agree.

When Larry, Rik and Jamie state that long RQ are not usual, I agree
with them ( see question marks above ).
When They speak about cache misses, I agree with them if it's a general
discussion about the need of keeping low the cache footprint of the kernel
code, but I can't agree if we speak about a "great cache trashing" of the patch.

As I've said You in a private mail, I can agree with You here but I think You
can agree with me that this "broken design" exists.

I prefer to reserve the phrase "very bad" for other things ;) , but I can agree
here.

As You see from my previous emails I've ever meant "high workloads" with 
"long RQ".

I insist, I You want to speak about cache misses read the patch.

And my patch ? Please underline its cache misses more than the current scheduler
have and weight the difference with the current scheduler ones.

I can agree here, more a process run higher is the probability that it touches
new RAM locations.

IRQs apart, this is an evidence.

This is what threads.c do, but it's an instrument for switch times measurements.
To summarize ( and conclude ) with all guys that have taken part to discussion :
1) RQ > 30 exist in "nature" and is proved by vmstats ( of real loads not
benchs ) that other guys post me
2) We can agree to consider these cases as rare
3) We agree on keeping scheduler cache ( and icache ) footprint as low as
possible ( even if I think that to make a single cache miss to have a percent of
improvement You must push the system at high switch / sec )
4) We agree on the fact that improving scheduler switch times You don't have
a great overall gain. As You can see in the message that open this thread,
since the gain percent You get on the scheduler must be multiplied by the
schedule time percent You get about 5% with 40 threads.
Higher _scheduler_ performance will came with higher RQ, but I agree that
these are exceptional cases.
5) I don't agree when You say that the patch have a "great cache trashing".
This means that You've not readed the patch.
6) I can agree finally when You say to reject the patch due to the fact that,
as outlined above :
"Kernel code bloat" vs. "Uman loads gain"  :  1 - 0

Davide.
