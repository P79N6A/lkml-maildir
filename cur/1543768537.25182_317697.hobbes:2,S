Whilst your changes may have merit, I'd much rather see effort spent
on getting PAT into shape than further massaging MTRR.  Its well past its
smell-by-date, and theres been no activity whatsoever afaik on getting
Terrence Ripperda's cachemap stuff beaten into shape.
I'll dust off the last version he sent and diff against latest-mm later
so it can get some more commentary. It seems everyone is in violent
agreement that we want PAT support, but nothing seems to happen.
