This reserved bit seems to be an alias to the earlier mentioned PUEN bit
which allows to connect the pull up manually regardless of VBUS.
You will find that bit at page 276 in
http://www.amd.com/files/connectivitysolutions/aufamily/au1200/32798e_Au1200_ds.pdf
If you compare the registers you will find that UDC controller of
Au1200 is 99.9% compatible with UDC of CS5536. Same for
CS5536 UOC and Au1200 OTG Controller. But OTG Controller of
Au1200 has more functionality and bits.
Unfortunately this bit is not the complete solution for your problem.
When setting PUE then connect and disconnect events cannot be
detected by UDC. If you disconnect and connect again you
probably will notice that there will be no new enumeration as
expected.

My pleasure! It is fun for me to continue this thread.

I will do when I have a new CS5536 board. Thanks for your
analysis again!
