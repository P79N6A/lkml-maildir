Indeed. I was just discussing compiler issues, not asm atomicity
issues.

As far as I know, it doesn't and isn't.
However, the volatile qualifier is defined in the ISO C standard. If
gcc breaks the restrictions on what it is allowed to do with volatile
objects implied by that definition, then it has a bug. If the same
restrictions don't also apply for the C expressions in inline asm
constraints, then that would also be a bug, since it would be
worthless as a feature. But I haven't noticed any problems in this
area with recent versions of gcc/egcs.
