It seems that both drivers were developed independently, and both went
to kernel in the past. Only some time after Jiri we realized that PCI
IDs were conflicting.

So, we need a quick fix. Maybe the better for now is to do a quick
workaround to 2.6.17, backported also to 2.6.16. We can work for a
definitive solution to 2.6.18 or 2.6.19.

There are some new boards from a very well known vendor in Europe
(Hauppauge) that uses also saa7146.
Currently, there are some drivers probing for saa7146 PCI IDs:
probing all PCI IDs:
	dpc7146.c, hexium_orion.c, mxb.c, stradis.c
probing specific IDs:
	hexium_gemini.c
I can imagine some possible solutions for this right now:
1) to include an insmod flag to allow PCI generic detection for each
driver. So, the default behavior would be the one at the previous
kernels;
2) We may create one saa7146_driver that probes the required PCI IDs and
then load the corresponding driver of the above listed. For those boards
whose don't have its own ID, an insmod parameter (or an autodetection
procedure) may specify if it is a dpc7146, hexium_orion, mxb or stradis
board.
(2) would be an interim solution until we integrate all stuff into just
one driver.
