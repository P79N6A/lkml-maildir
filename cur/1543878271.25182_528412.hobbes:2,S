I am quite sure that the kernel RPM file is *already* compressed, at least
somewhat.  Otherwise, it's hard to explain this:
-rw-r--r--    1 529      263     17835757   Apr  5 00:19   kernel-2.6.20-1.3045.fc7.x86_64.rpm
% du -s /lib/modules/2.6.20-1.3038.fc7/
76436   /lib/modules/2.6.20-1.3038.fc7/
and it can't all be slack space at ends of files:
% find /lib/modules/2.6.20-1.3038.fc7/ -type f | wc -l
1482
Even on a 4K filesystem, the *max* wasted slack would be about 4M.
And what do you know - if you tar.gz that /lib/modules:
% tar czf /tmp/kern.tar.gz /lib/modules/2.6.20-1.3038.fc7/
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
% ls -l /tmp/kern.tar.gz 
-rw-r--r-- 1 valdis valdis 15506359 2007-04-07 13:19 /tmp/kern.tar.gz
The *compressed* tar is about 15M (remember the .rpm contained a 2M vmlinuz
as well - that;s compressed too).  So we're right up to the 17M of the .rpm,
which indicates that the RPM is compressed at a factor close to tar.gz.
I'd not be surprised to find out that your digital-video also contains
at least some light compression - if it's mpeg or similar, that's already
had some *heavy* compression done to it....
