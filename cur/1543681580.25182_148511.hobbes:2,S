hdparm /dev/hde  from 2.6.0-pre1
/dev/hde:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 50765/16/63, sectors = 117231408, start = 0
---
hdparm /dev/hde from 2.4
/dev/hde:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 116301/16/63, sectors = 117231408, start = 0
I hadn't noticed the change in readahead previously, so I tried setting it 
to 8 in 2.6.0-pre1 with hdparm -a 8 /dev/hde
hdparm -t /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   32 MB in  3.01 seconds =  10.64 MB/sec
hdparm -a 512 on the other hand...
 Timing buffered disk reads:  140 MB in  3.03 seconds =  46.18 MB/sec
and I get my previous numbers back.
I guess the meaning of the parameter has changed dramatically?  (what was 
once sectors is now bytes?)
