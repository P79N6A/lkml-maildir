I've tried the dumb solution of setting the mask on the PCI device (for 
both ports) whenever an ATAPI device is detected, and ran into problems 
with that. If we really need to keep the block queue bounce limit and 
DMA mask the same, then we then have to set the bounce limit on both 
ports as well. If you blindly do that from slave_config, though, then 
you blow up since on the first port's initial slave_config the block 
queue for the second port isn't allocated yet, so you'd have to detect 
that case somehow. And if it's done via hotplug after the other port is 
already in use, it'll be changing the limits on a port that's in active 
use, which seems like it could be a bit racy.
So, any ideas? Maybe using the separate struct device is the easiest 
solution, if it'll work..
