perhaps it'll be simpler with only the attach file and using a special
magic value ("", "none", "detach", whatever) to manually detach a device
from the driver.
Is it possible (and worthwhile) to reattach a manually detached device
to the default driver? Perhaps using a magic value "auto" for attach.
Something like your dev.autoattach=2 rescan method, but for one
device only. (What is the use case to rescan all busses, anyway?)
