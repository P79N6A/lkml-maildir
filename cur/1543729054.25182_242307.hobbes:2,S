Ok, there is a visible difference from P0 to P1 with the extract_entropy
and via-rhine hacks:
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.8.1-P0
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.8.1-P1
The left spike is bigger with P1, which is more easily visible on linear
scaled graph on the left, as we are hitting the fast path more often. 
Also the smaller spike at 400 usecs disappears.
