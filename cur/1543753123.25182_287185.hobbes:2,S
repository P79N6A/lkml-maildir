OK.  Where is this stuff documented?
BTW, I think this violates POSIX, which states...
  The nice value set with nice() shall be applied to the process. If
  the process is multi-threaded, the nice value shall affect all
  system scope threads in the process.
(It does not affect SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR threads, however.)
Is it possible to call sched_setscheduler() with a thread ID instead
of a pid?  That's what I really need.  JACK sets and resets the thread
priorities from a different thread.
