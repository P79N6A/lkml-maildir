Yeap, agreed.  SRST on PATA works on most devices tho.  This device is
the first reported one which genuinely doesn't like SRST itself but we
also had a case where a device doesn't report proper diagnostic code and
another one which reports incorrect device class code.
Hardreset on SATA works better because it's much more integral part of
the protocol.  SRST also seems to work better but there is an emulated
PMP device which craps itself if SRST is issued to it.

Most BIOSen, Windows and old IDE driver don't reset at all during
probing.  They first issue IDENTIFY unconditionally, if that fails,
IDENTIFY_PACKET.  From the beginning, libata has issued reset during
probing.  We've had a few problems regarding this but they have been
worked around successfully till now.  One of the upsides of doing reset
during probing is that the reset code path gets tested a lot and libata
is more likely to recover properly after error conditions.  With SATA,
this is getting more important because errors are much more common and
happen occasionally even on perfectly healthy machines.
As libata gets much wider userbase including old/weird PATA devices, we
seem to be facing more of these broken devices.  We may be reaching the
point where the benefit of doing reset during probing isn't worth the
price we have to pay, at least on PATA.
Jeff, what do you think?
