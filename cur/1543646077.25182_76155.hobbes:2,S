AFAIK, writeX macros should swap as needed, i.e.
	writel(0x100,ioaddr);
should arrive as bit 8 set on the hardware. [please correct me if I'm 
wrong] Thus the input into write{b,w,l} should be in host byte order.
	u{8,16,32}	array[];
	__set_bit_{8,16,32}(,array);
	write{b,w,l}(array[],ioaddr);
would achieve that.
