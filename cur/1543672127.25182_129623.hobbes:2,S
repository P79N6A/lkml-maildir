  It wanted to.    That is signature of  64 bit value
  being divided by an abitrary non-power-of-two divider.
  If there is a non-fast-path use for the division,
  using   do_div()  macro.   Originally for   lib/vsprintf.c
  from which you can deduce the usage.
  If it is in fast-path,   then the code needs serious
  re-thought.
