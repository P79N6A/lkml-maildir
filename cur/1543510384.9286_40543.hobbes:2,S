The following can be read in Configure.help (at least in the 2.3 kernels;
I haven't checked the 2.2 tree out yet)
Is this really the case (the brokeness) or is this comment out of date?
If it's still the case, when will it be fixed (not that *I* personally
have any use for it, but...)
CSZ packet scheduler
CONFIG_NET_SCH_CSZ
  Say Y here if you want to use the Clark-Shenker-Zhang (CSZ) packet
  scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices. At the
  moment, this is the only algorithm that can guarantee service for
  real-time applications (see the top of net/sched/sch_csz.c for
  details and references about the algorithm).
  Note: this scheduler is currently broken.
