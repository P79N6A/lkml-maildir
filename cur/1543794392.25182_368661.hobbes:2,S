I didn't actually mean totally power off. Spin down would be fine with 
me. Just seems like a waste to run a drive for 24 hours that is used 
only for 10 minutes. That drive is there so if the main drive blows I 
can run down to the datacenter and move one cable and be back up again.
You know what's interesting is that I read somewhere that computers use 
as much power as 4 hoover dams can generate. And since a lit of these 
computer are running Linux just a few lines of code can create enough 
energy savings to perhaps power a small city. Kind of amazing when you 
think about it.
SATA isn't really "new" any more. I personally consider IDE to be 
obsolete. Seems to me that Linux should fully support SATA to the same 
level as IDE drives. And I'm saying that as someone who doesn't have to 
actually code it. But I will leave messages of praise and thanks in this 
mailing list if you all catch up.
