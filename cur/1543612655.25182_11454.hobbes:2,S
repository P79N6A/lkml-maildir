Isn't this still just an artifact of the default 1:3 kernel/user virtual 
address space split? I've never tried it myself but isn't there a 2:2 patch 
available that has the effect of moving the highmem boundary up?

All I know is that a streaming io app I was playing with showed a drastic 
performance hit when the kernel was compiled with CONFIG_HIGHMEM. On W2K we 
saw no slowdown with 2 or even 4GB of RAM so I think solutions must exist.
