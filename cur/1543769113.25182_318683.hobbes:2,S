This is a difficult problem, but it's not as completely invalid as
you seem to think. The use case I remember taking advantage of in
actual experience is from the classic MacOS. The way the mac handled
floppies was very interesting. There was a way to eject an HFS floppy
without unmounting it. Using this trick, you could have multiple disks
mounted using the same physical drive. It kept as much as it could
in RAM to be able to use the files, and the system would block on
unknown sectors until the correct disk was reinserted. However, it's
very difficult to get this level of usage without full knowledge all
the way from the device driver up to the UI. Since Apple controlled
the whole thing, they could get away with this. I'm not sure we could
do an equivalent thing in as different of an environment as we have.
They could tell apart each filesystem, notify the user when a different
disk was needed, and everything else to have a seamless experience.
