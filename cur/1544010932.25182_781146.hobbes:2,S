I think that if we need a fix for 2.6.28 I'll just make cgroup_path()
check for a NULL dentry in the passed cgroup, rather than shuffling
any code around. That combined with a simple RCU free in
cgroup_diput() should do the trick - I think I'll leave the existing
synchronize_rcu() at the beginning of cgroup_diput() in case we need
it for more reasons than I originally mentioned in the comment there.
