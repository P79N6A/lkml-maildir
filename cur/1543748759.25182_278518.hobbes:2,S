I don't know the ACPI details, but as far as dyanmic-hz is concerned I
seem to recall I tested it with HZ=10/25/50/... too (as well as
HZ=2000/5000...), everything will work flawlessy but any number below
<50 will pretty much guarantee not to show even an animated flash or gif
fluenty ;). Said that you can use X just fine, not only the console (my
X usage on the laptop sure doesn't need a fast HZ for example).
