I made three experiments regarding kexec with frame buffer support (vesafb). For
each of them I gathered dmesg messages from original and relocated kernel, in
order to easily compare them later on. These tests were run on a virtual machine
in order to provide the same environment for each experiment.
Here are my tests and related results:
	1) Frame buffer not enabled
Original kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro
Relocated kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro
Everything went well, as supposed to be. I was able to read boot messages and to
see login prompts.
	2) Frame buffer enabled in the relocated kernel
Original kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro
Relocated kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=791
This time I was able to read boot messages and so on, but I couldn't be able to
load vesafb in the relocated kernel. dmesg showed nothing about vesafb.
	3) Frame buffer enabled in the original kernel
Original kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=791
Relocated kernel command line: root=/dev/hda1 ro {vga=791,}
This time I wasn't able to read boot messages in the relocated kernel, whether
vga parameter was set or not. I looked at dmesg in order to get some useful
informations:

It seems relocated kernel doesn't (or can't) load vesafb. Is frame buffer
supported in kexec or there is some work-in-progress?
