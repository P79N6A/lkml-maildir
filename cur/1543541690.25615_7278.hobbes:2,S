I believe i have found a bug in RAMFS in 2.4.0-test6.
On a 486-120, 80 megs ram, redhat-6.2 stock release using "mount -t ramfs
ramfs /mnt" doing an "ls -s" on files copied to /mnt all files show 0
size. However, "ls -l" shows the correct sizes. Is this intentional, and,
if it is, should it be noted?
Thank you,
Geoff
