Subject: [patch] minimal ACPI bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

"Avoid creating multiple /proc entries when (buggy) ACPI
BIOS tables erroneously list both fixed- and generic-
feature buttons."
While the function already prints a disgnostic message 
on this and registers the new button dir in /proc, it fails to 
remove the old one. 
This is a trivial patch which actually does that. 
ACPI maintainer Andy, please approve that. 
Regards,
Wolly
