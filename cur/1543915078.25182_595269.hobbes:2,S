The licence text we are talking about disagrees with what you claim:

We are talking about dual-licenced code, not about BSD licenced code 
incorporated into GPL'ed code.
That other people can distribute the original dual-licenced code 
dual-licenced or BSD-only, and that you can get the code under this 
licences from there, is without a doubt. But *the author* allowed me to 
choose the licence when *I distribute it*.
