A question on sigwaitinfo based IO mechanism in multithreaded
applications.
I am trying to use RT signals to notify me of IO events using RT signals
instead of SIGIO in a multithreaded applications. I noticed that there
was some discussion on lkml during november 1999 with the subject of the
discussion as "Signal driven IO". In the thread I noticed that RT
signals were being delivered to the worker thread. I am running 2.6.10
kernel and I am trying to use the very same mechanism and I find that
only SIGIO being propogated to the worker threads and RT signals only
being propogated to the main thread and not the worker threads where I
actually want them to be propogated too. On further inspection I found
that the following patch which I have attached solves the problem.
I am not sure if this is a bug or feature in the kernel.
Thanks,
Bharath
