There is already a flag you can set on vlan devices (reorder-header)
that strips the VLAN tag before presenting it to user-space.

On tx, if it shows up on the vlan device, we add that device's VID to
the header if no VID is currently in the SKB.  If it is in the SKB header
we change the VID to be the tx dev's VID (if it was different).  This allows user-space
to send a raw ethernet frame on a vlan device and have it automatically
go out of the box on the correct vlan.  User-space can also send raw VLAN frames
and have those also go out on the correct VLAN.

Unless I mis-understand, this has been working since 2.4 days :)
