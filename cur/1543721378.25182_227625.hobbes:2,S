There are few, if any ABI compatibility test suites. By and large,
important breakages are almost immediately observable, and the less
important ones can be fixed up afterward, so I'd encourage you to
proceed with testing by means of targeted testcases when a specific
area is in doubt, and general benchmarks and stress tests for the rest.
