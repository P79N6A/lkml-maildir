This is interesting. I wonder how much tuning like this , just changing
thread priorities, which would effect the results of these tests.
PREEMPT_RT is not pre-tuned for every situation , but the bests
performance is achieved when the system is tuned. If any of these tests
rely on a low priority thread, then we just raise the priority and you
have better performance.
These other systems like Vanilla 2.6.x , and I-pipe aren't massively
tunable like PREEMPT_RT .
