applies incrementally atop the bk2 snapshot.
So, where does one get a fanbase, anyway? NFI. Here's at least an
attempt to acquire one, with desktop-oriented goodies to speed up
top(1), apparently to the point where top(1) barely even registers
on its own cpu usage reports even with 1s refreshes (900MHz P-III).
It might also vaguely help people instrument heavy multitasking loads.
For what it's worth, the O(1) proc_pid_statm() patch also restores some
of the old 2.4.x fields whose support was removed from 2.5.x.
Merged:
- flow.c compilefix
	Well, I didn't really do any of the work, but at least I don't
	have to carry it around anymore.
Changes since 2.5.71-wli-1:
+ O(1) proc_pid_readdir()
	originally due to Manfred Spraul; figures out its position from
	a small pid hashtable rearrangement
+ O(1) proc_pid_statm()
	originally due to Ben LaHaise (I think); keeps count of the various
	proc_pid_statm() counters whenever twiddling ptes.
+ non-i386 highpmd fixes
	write stubs for non-i386 pmd twiddling functions
+ highpmd fixes
	a few mm/memory.c functions forgot to pass pmd pointers by reference
+ O(1) buffered_rmqueue() fixes
	correct small typo in CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND code touched by it
+ i386 pagetable cache fixes
	Correct failure to reset tlb->freed, which resulted in wildly wrong
	mm->rss counts. Also define FREE_PTE_NR so CONFIG_PREEMPT compiles.
All 12 patches:
O(1) rmqueue_bulk()
	Implement deferred coalescing with list-of-lists -structured order 0
	deferred queues so buffered_rmqueue() in O(1) expected time.
lowmem_page_address() microoptimization
	use page_to_pfn() to inherit its arch-specific microoptimizations
highpmd
	shove pmd's into highmem, by brute force
trivial /proc/ BKL removals
	Kill off some blatantly unnecessary BKL-grabbing in /proc/
i386 pagetable cache
	Resurrect the i386 pagetable cache
pgd_ctor
	Use slab ctors for i386 pgd's, and be safe with AGP and highpmd
O(1) proc_pid_readdir()
	originally due to Manfred Spraul; figures out its position from
	a small pid hashtable rearrangement
O(1) proc_pid_statm()
	originally due to Ben LaHaise (I think); keeps count of the various
	proc_pid_statm() counters whenever twiddling ptes.
non-i386 highpmd fixes
	write stubs for non-i386 pmd twiddling functions
highpmd fixes
	a few mm/memory.c functions forgot to pass pmd pointers by reference
O(1) buffered_rmqueue() fixes
	correct small typo in CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND code touched by it
i386 pagetable cache fixes
	Correct failure to reset tlb->freed, which resulted in wildly wrong
	mm->rss counts. Also define FREE_PTE_NR so CONFIG_PREEMPT compiles.
