BTW. Why we need to redesign timers at all? The cost of timer interrupt
each 1/100 second is nearly zero (1000 instances on S/390 VM is not common
case - it is not reasonable to degradate performance of timers because of
this).
Timers more precise than 100HZ aren't probably needed - as MIN_RTO is 0.2s
and MIN_DELACK is 0.04s, TCP would hardly benefit from them.
