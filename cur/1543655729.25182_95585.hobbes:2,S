You've had to have stood with your head in the sand for a few years not to see 
that Microsoft actually has a good OS as well. Win2k _does_ have nice 
features and runs fast. The main problem with comparing unices and Windoze, 
is the question "What is an operating system"? Is the kernel the OS? Are the 
libraries part of it as well? Is X part it? Windows has a good bunch of APIs 
that quite a few userspace programmers love. Unices + libs + X don't have the 
same abstraction as Windows has, resulting in longer, more low-level 
development.
I don't like Windows, but saying there's nothing except the GUI doesn't make 
you look smarter.
