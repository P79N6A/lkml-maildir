The `noexec_user_stack' option on Solaris causes quite some headaches
among the GNAT folks.  Nested subprograms are extremly common in Ada
programs, and the GCC backend uses trampolines to implement them.
For Ada developers (and users of other Ada programmers), it would
*extremly* annoying if a non-executable stack became a kernel option
(which some distributions certainly would use as default).  I think
the same applies to Pascal and quite a few other languages than C/C++.
