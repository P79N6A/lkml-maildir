Haven't had time to look at the current implementation, but the in-kernel
interface is still horrible as it duplicates the dnotify calls all over the
place, using IN_FOO instead of DN_FOO.  Please add a layer of notify_foo
wrappers that calls into both.
Also ioctl is not an acceptable interface for adding new core functionality.
