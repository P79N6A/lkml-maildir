Well, it won't do that. You have to use "kdev_t_to_nr()", which (whenever
the format of kdev_t changes) will still be identical in the low 16 bits.
Now, if somebody actually has the raw "kdev_t" in their on-disk
structures, that's a real problem, but I don't think anybody does.
Certainly I didn't see reiserfs do it (but it may well be missing a few
"kdev_t_to_nr()" calls)
