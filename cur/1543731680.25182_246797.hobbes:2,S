The big nasty is that userspace has very little to go on here. We need
to report the limits of the address space somewhere for this kind of
affair and probably even hammer out our own addenda to ABI specs so
instead of SVR4 $ARCH/ELF ABI spec we have a Linux $ARCH/ELF ABI spec.
I see no one so motivated to make backward-incompatible ABI changes
that they are willing to do that kind of work.
