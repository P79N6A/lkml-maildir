Nope, my bad. I diffed two -mm trees on remote machine with:
diff -NrupX b/Documentation/dontdiff a b|'bzip it and send me a copy'
but dontdiff contains files, that _should_ be diffed, gensyms and mmu stuff
included, so I was not able to compile it and even if I downloaded and untarred
fresh, clean archive and diffed with '-X dontdiff' flag to my working tree,
there was no difference, so I didn't get it. I understood after omitting -X
flag, when I see kilobytes of differencies.
So, sorry for the noise.
regards,
