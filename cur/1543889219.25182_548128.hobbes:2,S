yeah. There's a help section at the top of the trace which explains the 
other fields too:
                 _------=> CPU#
                / _-----=> irqs-off
               | / _----=> need-resched
               || / _---=> hardirq/softirq
               ||| / _--=> preempt-depth
               |||| /
               |||||     delay
   cmd     pid ||||| time  |   caller
      \   /    |||||   \   |   /
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    0us : ktime_get_ts (ktime_get)
the function name in braces is the parent function. So in this case the 
trace entry means we called ktime_get_ts() from ktime_get().
