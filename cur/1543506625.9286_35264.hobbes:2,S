	Saw a similar problem with serial ports.  Apparently I set my irq's
up wrongly in the bios on my ibm pc,  ttyS0 - irq 3, ttyS1 - irq 4.
Dials up fine from windows, but gave me grief under linux.  When you dial a
modem, it will wait about 10-15 seconds before dialing, and dropping all
kinds of characters (I'm surprised it worked at all, and the fact that it
did actually made troubleshooting harder since I didn't check irq/com port
settings in the rc files).
	While this is a user problem, it would be nice to have the kernel
say "you stupid luser, there isn't a serial port here", to paraphrase
someone... 8-)
