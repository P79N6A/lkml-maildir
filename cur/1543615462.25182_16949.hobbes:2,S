While you are at it, the following patch to scripts/Lindent makes it do the
right thing as well.  From what I can see, the following is more consistent
with the actual practise in the kernel code.  Sadly, indent (v2.2.4) will
break the indenting of any line with a colon (e.g. labels, named struct
initialization), so it is not possible to just run Lindent on the whole
tree.
I removed the following two options:
-bs: Put a space between sizeof and its argument.
-psl: Put the type of a procedure on the line before its name.
I added the following options:
-nbbo: don't prefer to break lines before boolean operators
-ci8: indent continuation lines 8 characters
-ncs: Do not put a space after cast operators.
-lps: Leave space between # and preprocessor directive.
-pmt: Preserve access and modification times on output files.
-npro: Do not read .indent.pro files.
