I don't know if I should enter a bug on this or not as I thought this
one was fixed already, but I have an Intel dg45fc that comes with a gig
enet card built in. If I force the connection to 100mb by connecting a
switch that is only capable of 100mb, all is good, as soon as I connect
it to a gig capable switch, it bricks the machine on the next reboot forcing me to reload
the bios.
Also, the "core multiplexing technology" option within the bios must be
turned off in order to load and run OpenSuse 11.1 at all. With this
option turned on within the bios, the machine will boot to grub, let
you select your boot option, will show about 5 lines on the screen (f2
quickly), then powers off/on.
I have tried the following combinations: x86_64 with and without XEN,
i586 with and without XEN, all behave identically with the above
observations.
