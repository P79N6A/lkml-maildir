rt13 makes use of the gcc extension:
	int __builtin_types_compatible_p (type1, type2)
which from what I can tell was first introduced to gcc in version 3.1.1
	
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1.1/gcc/Other-Builtins.html
In any case, I am unable to compile rt13 with gcc-2.95.  I have tried various 
-std args as well, but the compiler dies on __builtin_types_compatible_p.
1) Is it acceptable to require >= gcc-3.1.1 to compile a Linux kernel?
2) Would a patch/work-around for gcc-2.95 compatibility be accepted if I provide 
one?  (assuming it is a sane implementation of course :-)
Thanks,
