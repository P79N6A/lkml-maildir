I wouldn't do that like this, since e1000_suspend already does a pci_set_power_state() 
right before it exits, and doing two of those closely after another might result in an 
undetermined state.
I would be more interested in forcing D3 state instead of the current 
`pci_set_power_state(pdev, pci_choose_state(pdev, state));` in e1000_suspend, so can you 
try this instead?
diff --git a/drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c b/drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c

         return 0;
  }
alternatively, you can try PCI_D3cold or PCI_D0, but setting the device to D0 is a 
no-op: the device is already in D0 at run-time, so that's silly.
In any case: this is not a driver bug, but really (unfortunately) a platform issue, so 
this fix is not suitable for general cases *at all*, and we'd have to validate this 
nasty workaround on all other chipsets that e1000 supports too, something that ain't 
going to happen I'm sure.
constructive: I've just spend some time working with e100+suspend+shutdown+netconsole, 
so I'll audit e1000 for that in the next few weeks and make sure that all works 
properly. Perhaps that yields something for you.
Cheers,
Auke
