Would it be possible to, instead of implementing a full vm system inside
  the kernel for device drivers, to provide a way to have the binary
  drivers be a userland process?
I'd love to be able to keep binary drivers out of my kernel, and I
  know many people harp on how hard it is to maintain binary drivers in
  the Linux kernel due to the rapid evolution of Linux (namely, how fast
  interfaces and structures change).  If there were a way to put these
  binary drivers in userspace, we could potentially solve both problems
  in one swipe, no?
