Well what do you know...
I added isapnp=0 and it worked.
<OPL3-SA3> at 0x370
<MS Sound System (CS4231)> at 0x534 irq 5 dma 1,0
<MPU-401 0.0  Midi interface #1> at 0x330 irq 5 dma -1,0
The dma and the MSS address (0x534) looks odd, but at least it
seems to play now.
And no, AFAIK, this driver has never been able to detect PNP settings.
If you try to run it without them, you get this:
opl3sa2: io, mss_io, irq, dma, and dma2 must be set
Thanks for your help!

... Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer,
my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any
resemblance between the above and my own views is non-deterministic.  The
question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them
is left as an exercise for the reader.  The question of the existence of
the reader is left as an exercise for the second god coefficient.  (A
discussion of non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope
of this article.)
