That was my original thought "if copy_from_user fails then something 
really bad is happening and we should just fail the entire IO operation".
Then when Alan pointed out that I'd probably be messing up tape->bh I got 
nervous becourse it seemed to me that he probably had a point, but when I 
went back and looked at the code again I ended up with the conclusion that 
even if we did mess it up it wouldn't actually matter since we'll be 
failing the entire IO since I also added code in the caller to test for 
the <0 return from this function and abort the entire operation in that 
case.
Alan: Would you mind explaining why this is not safe? If there's something 
I'm missing I'd really like to know.
