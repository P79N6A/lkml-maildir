Sorry for the delay it works. This time I can use iwlist eth scan.
I have some difficulties to associate and I need to rmmod/modprobe in
order to associate but it is another problem linked to a really weak

Another good point is:
- before path : wifi link led is off before suspend and on after
- after patch: wifi link led is always off.
Initialisation problem?
I will send you dmesg by private mail.
