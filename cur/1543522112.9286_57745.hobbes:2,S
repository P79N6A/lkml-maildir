We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.

   For those of you interested in threading and scheduling issues, a
   paper we have written about our experiences with Java, Volanomark,
   and Linux is available on the Linux Zone of IBM Developer Works:
   
http://www.ibm.com/developer/linux.
Umm.... I couldn't find the paper off the Linux Zone list.   Can you
give me a direct URL?  Many thanks!
