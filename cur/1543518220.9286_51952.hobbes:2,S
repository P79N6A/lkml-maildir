Whomever owns the TTY drivers, how do you turn the damn thing on to
allow you to display characters above 127?  I am using the ncurses lib
for building our nwfs utils with a CWorthy look and feel menuing
interface, along with some management tools, and I cannot get characters
aove 127 to display.  If I use the VCS interface, then I can get it to
work properly, but VCS screens cannot be accessed from remote terminals
on other systems.  I realize the expanding beyond 7 bits on the terminal
display may not work on some terminals, but who gives a damn?  Linux was
a PC operating system, so this should be supported, and I only care
about it working on Linux for the ncurses versions of the tools.  There
is also a text based version of the tools that will work on everything,
even 7 bit terminal, but we want to put out some fancier tools for folks
with Linux, DOS, NT, etc.
