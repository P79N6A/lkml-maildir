It does -- a cast from integer to pointer isn't required to be a bitwise
noop.  Machines on which NULL isn't bitwise zero do exist, and the C
standard allows them.  What is almost certainly more common than "all
bits zero is not a NULL pointer" is "any NULL pointer is not necessarily
all bits zero"; there are quite a few machines on which there are
nonzero bitpatterns that are still valid NULL pointers, but an all-zero
memset() will still produce NULL pointers.
However, the particular supersets of the C standard that gcc provides
and which the kernel are written in (the latter being a proper subset of
the former) does not.
