Subject: Error while making 2.4.5 bzImage with CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII=y

Hi,
This is the config file:
http://www.holanyi.hu/config
produced with make menuconfig on a vanilla tree;
and this is the log file:
http://www.holanyi.hu/bzImage.log
of the command:
time make dep clean bzImage modules moduels_install 2>&1 | tee bzImage.log
The errors do not occur if I switch on SMP. Howver, I would like to get out
the most of my PIII 500 and would not like to use SMP and would also like to
use APM stuff.
Is this a known problem with 2.4.5? Sorry if yes.
Anyway, I could not find relevant info in the archives of this list about
this issue.
Is there hope I will be able to compile a suitable kernel for this PIII?
Thanks
Csan
