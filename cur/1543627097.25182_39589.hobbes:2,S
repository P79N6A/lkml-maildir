New core and common code for kbuild 2.5 is available in
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18813&release_id=83065
Changes from core-3 to core-4.
  GNUism removal.
  WISH is exposed in case your wish binary is not in /usr/bin/wish.
  awk changed to $(AWK) throughout.
  PP_variables added to expose headers and compiler flags that might be
  different on on non-Linux build platforms.
  Force the use of KBUILD_SHELL instead of relying on a working build
  platform shell.
  Drop back to getopt if getopt_long is not available on the build
  platform, in which case only the single character command flags are
  available.
  Documentation updates.
  *** kbuild 2.5-core-4 runs on Solaris using gcc, gmake, gawk. ***
  Would any brave (or foolhardy) person like to run kbuild 2.5 under
  Cygwin or other build platforms?
Changes from common-2.4.18-2 to common-2.4.18-3.
  Yet more aic7xxx problems :(
  Documentation updates.
  Correct fencepost error in scripts/tkparse.
Changes from common-2.4.19-pre6-1 to common-2.4.19-pre6-2.
  As for  common-2.4.18-2 -> 3.
