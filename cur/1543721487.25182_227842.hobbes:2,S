UT2004 works just fine here on a 2.6.7-rc3-mm2 with s6.E!
By the way great work Con!

There is some problem with the patch for the mm2.
All hunks succeeded but somehow there was a compilation error in kernel/sched.c.
After commenting out the following line I was able to compile the kernel:
line 118:
/*prio_array_t *active, *expired, arrays[2];*/
