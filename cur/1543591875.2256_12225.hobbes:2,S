Greetings!  2.2.19+ide, applied the patch because this box has a new
Promise PDC20267 ide controller.  14GB HP Colorado tape drive.  Before
we installed the new ide controller and patched the kernel, i.e. with
unpatched 2.2.19 running on a different ide controller, this setup
works just fine.  Now I get the following occasionally, which results
in corrupted dumps to tape:
May 21 10:27:47 intech9 kernel: hdh: status error: status=0x40 { DriveReady }
May 21 10:27:47 intech9 kernel: ide-scsi: Strange, packet command initiated yet DRQ isn't asserted
Any advice much appreciated!
