Will it? The theory behind a zone allocator like slab is that objects of the
same type have similar livetimes. Fragmentation mostly happens when objects
have very different live times. If you mix objects of different types
into the same slab then you might get more fragmentation.
kmalloc already has that problem but it probably shouldn't be added 
to other slabs too.
