that being the case, why push %cs and reload it without reason as the
code is mapped into every process?
therefore, would it not suffice to use:
        ...
        long_call(); //call to $0xfffff000 via near ret
        //code at $0xfffff000 returns directly here when a ret is issued
        ...
long_call:
        pushl $0xfffff000
        ret
