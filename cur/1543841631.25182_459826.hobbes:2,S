Here is the progress in tracking this down so far.
I am able to reproduce the problem on following kernel versions.
2.6.18-rc5
2.6.18-rc4
2.6.17.11
2.6.16.28
2.6.15.7
2.6.14.7
I am yet to find a latest kernel version - where this works :(
I am going to try older versions of the kernel.
Thanks,
Badari
