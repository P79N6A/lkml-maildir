What tool are you using to start the array? raidstart or mdadm?
There doesn't seem to be enough noise in the logs for it to be
raidstart (no "md: autorun ...") so I assume mdadm.
What do you get if you add "-v" to the mdadm running from rc.local?
Can you show me
  mdadm -E /dev/sda1 /dev/sdo1

I suspect this is just a co-incidence.  I cannot imagine how the major
device number could affect things at all.
