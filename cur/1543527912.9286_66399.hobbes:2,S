I wouldn't personally trust *anything* with automatically updating code
(aside from whitespace, but even that is iffy :).
Rest assured that I vim (with syntax highlighting) every patch and scan
it before submitting it.  One of the structs had a comment of the form
"/* foo *//* bar */" which my code did wrong the first time around since
it checked for C++ comments first, leaving "/* foo *". :)
I'm personally going to be feeding each patch per-struct (like
file_operations was done) to make things sane all-around.  I'll be making
attempt #3 at feeding inode_operations fixes soon :)

attached :)  I'm sure the semantics need work but it's a first pass (if
admittedly useless since the fops was about all that's been converted :)

If you do end up doing the initialization edits with cooledit (or
whatever), please take the time to give the perl script a shot at
it (modifying element_map as necessary) in case it helps catch
cases that could be fed back to make the perl a little better :)
