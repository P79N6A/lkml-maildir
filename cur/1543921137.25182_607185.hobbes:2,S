Subject: nVidia HPET force enable - merge requirements? (resend)

(Resend with CC's fixed)
Back in April, Mikko posted a patch to force enable the HPET on some nVidia 
chipsets:
v2:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/16/46
v3:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/17/354
What would need to be done to this patch to get it into x86 now (besides i386/ 
x86_64 -> x86 conversion), given that:
A) There is now a force_hpet boot parameter in the x86 tree (mm branch) 
(rather than relying on the solution in the earlier patches of a config 
option).
B) On the other hand, the force-quirk's are going into quirks.c, whilst 
Mikko's patch requires PCI scanning in early_quirks.c (could the PCI scanning 
be done in early_quirks.c and the actual HPET enabling handled in quirks.c 
later - or if not, could this early quirk play be made to obey the force_hpet 
boot option)?
