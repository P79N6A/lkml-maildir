Well, if you need that many bits... guess I would need to study the code (hard with binary 
attachments) to understand why you need so many bits.

Just what is your argument here?  As I understand it this is only a problem (i.e. sharing the code) 
if you are trying to single step or set breakpoints in the library code.

Well, the powers that be, decided that the kernel did not need the "missing" routines and that they 
just added bloat.  One then wonders why a debugger needs them.  Could you enlighten us on this?
