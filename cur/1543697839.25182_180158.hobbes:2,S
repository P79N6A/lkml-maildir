What happened is that I attempted to simplify the test code to send to 
you, and simplified out the problem by using
kill() instead of causing a fault. :-)
It's just what you describe here:

The behavior of 2.4 seems to be the same used by some dozens of Unix 
systems upon which my confidence test passed.
I agree that we should not be wrong in the same way as everyone else, 
and wonder if POSIX says anything about this. I could have been the only 
one using this "feature".
    Thanks
