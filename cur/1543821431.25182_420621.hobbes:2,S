Hey, I agree 100%, except for the last 6 words :) C++ is the very worst 
language I know in terms of badly thought out features, internal 
inconsistencies, ways to shoot one's feet off, and general ugliness. It 
will require _very_ tight control to avoid parts of the kernel going off 
in mutually incompatible directions.
But I think that the control is there; and if C++ is introduced slowly, 
one feature at a time, it can be kept sane. And I think there is 
definitely a payoff to be won out of a switch.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
