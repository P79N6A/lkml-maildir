No, MAP_SHARED mmap of /dev/zero uses shmem, which allocates distinct
pages for this (because in general tmpfs doesn't know if a readonly
file will be written to later on), and MAP_PRIVATE mmap of /dev/zero
uses the zeromap stuff which we were hoping to eliminate too
(though not in Nick's initial patch).
Looks like a job for /dev/same_page_over_and_over_again.

You scared me, I made no sense of that at first: ah yes,
repeatedly mmap'ing the same page can be done those ways.
