Ideally we should eliminate the BKL completely...  but you need to
review tons of code when messing around with it, which makes removal
annoying.  Al Viro seems to know this stuff pretty well, and possibly
has plans to remove BKL from various bits of the fs's.
Alan Cox made the comment on IRC that BKL was put into the release
method in 2.4 to synchronize open-close-power management.  Don't forget
to take that third into account either, in the cases where such applies.
