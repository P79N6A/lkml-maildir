Bzzt.  You get a false deadlock with multiple threads like so:
Thread A of task B takes lock 1
Thread C of task D takes lock 2
Thread C of task D blocks on lock 1
Thread E of task B blocks on lock 2
We currently declare deadlock at this point (unless the deadlock detection
code has changed since I last looked at it), despite thread A being about
to release lock 1.  Oh, and by the way, thread E is capable of releasing
lock 1, so you can't just say "well, detect by thread instead of by task".
So the only way I can see to accurately detect deadlock is to simulate
the future execution of all threads in task B to see if any of them
will release lock 1 without first gaining lock 2.  Which, I believe,
is halting-equivalent.
