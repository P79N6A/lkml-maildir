I wonder if it'd be useful a "make compiletest" which developers
are told to run before submitting changes - a target that would compile
a kernel with allyesconfig, another with allnoconfig, allmodconfig 
and a couple of randconfig, with the time it could improve this
kind of errors.
(I tried to do it myself but I don't know swahili well enought to
hack Makefiles)
