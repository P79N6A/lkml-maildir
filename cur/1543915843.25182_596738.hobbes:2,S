Yes, you are 100% right and I'm 90% lier, 10% blind (maybe backward
too).

Since this whole locking scheme is really quite a puzzle, and needs
more than one or two looks to figure it out, I'd better try stop to
discredit myself more.
Anyway it looks to me like the most sophisticated way of achieving
locklessness I've seen so far. I hope, there is still some gain after
this RCU + refcounting vs. simple locking. (It seems somebody had
similar doubts writing the "Lockless receive, part 1:" comment in
do_msgrcv(); and probably again I'm very wrong, but this checking of
validity of RCU protected structure with an r_msg value, which is
done to avoid refcounting, looks like not very different and has
some cost too).
