If I understand the two arch changes correctly then this means that before
going back to userspace always _all_ pending signals will be delivered.
Of course this would fix the original problem and the 'sigkill priority fix'
could be reverted, if all architectures would implement this behaviour.
Is this the way the kernel is supposed to handle signals now?
Just wondering, since this changes signal handling quite significantly from
what it was before.
