Good catch!
The sub_info is on the stack of call_usermodehelper_keys and with wait
set, the wait_for_helper is called as a thread and does the complete and
there is a chance that the call_usermodehelper_keys will return and use
its stack for something else, before the helper finishes, making the
wait not valid anymore, and worst, using a bad complete.
On a normal case, the wait_for_helper will call something in userland
and this would most likely allow the caller to finish with a correct
wait.  But still this in incorrect code, since there can definitely be a
race here.
OK, now on submitting a patch :-)
1. read Documentation/SubmittingPatches
2. Linus will probably not even read this (although he might).
  So try to find a maintainer. And even on this file you see at the 
  top:
	call_usermodehelper wait flag, and remove exec_usermodehelper.
	Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>  Jan 2003
Which means that Rusty was probably the one who wrote the code.
3. Use a -p1 patch format to submit.  IOW the files to compare against
should have been a/kernel/kmod.c  and not /tmp/kmod.c.
If you want a cool tool for making patches get quilt:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt
4. sign off your work by adding a "Signed-off-by: Full name <email@address>"
So please, fix up your patch and send it again properly :)
