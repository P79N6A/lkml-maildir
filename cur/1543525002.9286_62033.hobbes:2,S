Many database products let you spread a database over multiple files, in
which case the 2GB limit isn't necessarily a problem.  If you really
want a single file larger than that, then for 2.2 you are limited to
using a 64-bit platform such as Alpha or Sparc64.  2.4 will support
larger files on ia32, too.

For 2.2 kernels, the sgi raw I/O patch (
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/rawio
) will
support partitions of arbitrary size, using llseek with read or write.  The sgi 
asynchronous I/O patch for 2.2 also utilizes a 64-bit off_t when used to access
raw scsi disk partitions.
