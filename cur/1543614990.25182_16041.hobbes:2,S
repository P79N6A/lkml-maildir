It doesn't seem to be the problem some people is complaining about
lately. These people get OOM but their systems still have tons of
"available" memory in buffers and/or caches. This is not your case, and
it seems OOM kills a process just in time to avoid having no memory
available for the system to continue working.
I would run "top" and see what processes are eating up your memory,
because 128 MB RAM + 256 MB swap is more than enough for a "normal"
system. Maybe is a program that went crazy, and keeps on allocating all
your memory, leaving nothing for the rest. I have seen both X and
netscape processes behaving this way.
