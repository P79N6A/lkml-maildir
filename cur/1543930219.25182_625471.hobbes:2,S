The systems that I have here do _not_ in fact have that precondition, but the
systems from Ben, who originoally reported the problem do have that
precondition, and he has reported that this fixes the hang in the kdump boot.

I've got two printk's in this patch, one that indicates that Extended APIC ID's
are in use, and a second that indicates that there is a mismatch between the use
of extended APIC ids (bit 18) and the lack of an extended APIC id dest mask for
interrupt packets (bit 17).  Not sure if that meets you're requirements, but I
think its sufficient.  If you disagree, let me know and we can enhance them.
Thanks
