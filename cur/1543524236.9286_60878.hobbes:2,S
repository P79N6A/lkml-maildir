Yes.  With more than 4G of memory, you still need bounce buffers unless
your device drivers are *all* capable of supporting 64-bit addressing
(either via PCI-64 or through dual address cycles).
For addresses below 4G, your method may make sense.  I'd want to be
really sure that all devices will support those high addresses before
enabling it by default, though.
