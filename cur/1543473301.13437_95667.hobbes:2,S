With all the changes in the upcomming kernel, as well as the time invested
in its development, it seams to me that perhaps we should release it as
3.0.0.  2.2 makes it sound like an incrimental release, not much different
than 2.0.x.  Besides which 3.0.0 sounds much more sellable to future
potential customers/users who are used to MS's (as well as others') bad
habit of taking three versions to get thing right.
