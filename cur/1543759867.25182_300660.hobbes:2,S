I've just sent the whole thing split up into seven parts. After working
on both fbsplash and splashutils for the last few days, I came to the
conclusion that the initial silent mode patch wouldn't make much sense
(it would create a short fbsplash.c file with a single call to
call_usermodehelper()) and the whole splash interface thing would
completely pointless.
I tried to move as much as possible into userspace. If anyone can find 
away to move more code to the userspace, please let me know -- I'd be 
glad to make fbsplash even lighter :)
Live long and prosper.
