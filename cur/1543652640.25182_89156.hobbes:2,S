Subject: 2.5.47bk2 + current modutils == broken hotplug

The module-init-tools-0.6.tar.gz utilities (or something
related -- kbuild changes?) break hotplug since they no
longer produce the /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.*map
files as output ... so the hotplug agents don't have the
pre-built database mapping device info to drivers.
What's the plan for getting that back?  (And module.conf
params etc.)  "Changes" says version 2.4.2 is fine, which
appears to be wrong...
