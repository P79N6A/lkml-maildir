"0x0" is, of course, for relocation.

Personally I don't think such C compiler even existed. HISOFT C
on ZX Spectrum could be a good candidate but I think it didn't
have any optimizer :-)

Nope. Volatile just means that every read (and write) must actually
access the variable. Note that the compiler optimized out accesses
to the variable in the loop - while it has to check at the beginning
of funct(), it knows that the variable is constant through funct().
Note that "volatile" is not exactly what we usually want, but it
does the job (i.e., the program doesn't crash, but the code is
probably suboptimal).

You must be using a heavily broken compiler:
defiant:/tmp/khc$ cat test.c 
volatile int spinner = 0;
void funct(void)
{
     while(spinner)
         ;
}
defiant:/tmp/khc$ gcc -Wall -O2 -c test.c
defiant:/tmp/khc$ objdump -d test.o 
00000000 <funct>:
   0:   55                      push   %ebp
   1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:   a1 00 00 00 00          mov    0x0,%eax
   8:   85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
   a:   75 f7                   jne    3 <funct+0x3>
   c:   5d                      pop    %ebp
   d:   c3                      ret
