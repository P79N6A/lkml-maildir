Wow.  Good questions.  Those I2C module param. macros are fugly.
probe_range=list_of_up_to_48_entries
It's just a comma-separated list.
Don't put braces or parens or anything around the "triples".
E.g.,
probe_range=0,0,8,1,4,6
(that's 6 entries in the 'probe_range' list, not 2)
Parameter conversion is done by calling simple_strtoul (in this case),
since the parameter type is ushort.  The specified number base
is 0, which means base 10, unless some other base is specified,
with 0x or 0X meaning hex, or a leading 0 without an [xX]
following it means octal.

know the I2C code.
