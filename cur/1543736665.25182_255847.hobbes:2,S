I was just thinking it might be a suitable approach for some of the
distros to take when running on a machine with plenty of disk that for
whatever reason runs at risk of rolling over and dying - better to
take up some additional disk space than to have some critical server
process killed. It's not pretty but then neither is the oom killer,
and this might reduce some of that pain.
