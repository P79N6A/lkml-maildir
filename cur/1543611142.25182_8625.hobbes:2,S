	the memory check in bios is designed mostly for testing if (detected
memory chips == present memory chips).
	Safe comprehensive checking can be done by memtest86, and virtualy
unsafe testing can be cyclic kernel compilation (if you notice strange
compile errors at same kernel config but at different moments, you can
suspect that your hardware is rotten). 
	To: Sven
	are you sure that ALL your memory chips are bad? how about memory
latency and other bios settings, overclocking, etc.? try to setup your box
to run at slowest memory configuration as possible. It's hard to believe
that all of your chips are gone.
