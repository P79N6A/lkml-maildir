I tried egcs-2.91.66 (not sure if the sparc people are still using that?),
looks ok.
I merged the patch into my kbuild tree.
However, I'm not quite happy with "__attribute_used__".
Other examples of similar defines:
__deprecated
__init
__exit
So what about "__used" ? Admittedly, it's a bit short, but I like it 
better anyhow.
