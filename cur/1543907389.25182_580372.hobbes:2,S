FYI - it is integrated and tested prior to mainline, by Emulex (and who
else *really* tests it close to the degree we do ?). We do so, as a whole,
weeks ahead of the submit to the maintainer. Usually, there's only a couple
of small api changes that are picked up when we merge into the maintainers
pool.  And most of these are caught by us prior anyway as we package the
patchsets and ensure the integration into the maintainers pool is smooth.
