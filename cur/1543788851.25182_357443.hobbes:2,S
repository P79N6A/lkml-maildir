Using xchg on the spin unlock path is expensive. Really expensive on P4
compared to movb. It also doesn't guarantee anything either way around
especially as you go to four cores or change CPU (or in some cases quite
likely even chipset).
Spin lock paths should not be heavily contested. If they are then fix
the underlying problem with finer locking, or if you can't do that then
perhaps by serializing it with a queue.
