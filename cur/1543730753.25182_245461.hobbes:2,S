I'm well aware of the technique, but I was wondering if there was any
extra VFS baggage associated with a normal bind mount that might
be eliminated by restricting a different version of a bind mount to only
files.  That's why I asked later if anybody had benchmarked the bind
mount system to see how well it would scale to 1000 bound files and
directories.  If it's not a performance issue then I really don't care 
less,
but I have a somewhat old box that must make do as a fileserver, so
I'm very interested in maximizing the performance. I don't care much
about extra RAM consumption, only about CPU and bus usage.
Cheers,
