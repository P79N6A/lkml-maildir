That looks more complete and its cleaner. When I needed the HZ patch I
deliberately didn't care about #ifdef __KERNEL__ in the header files. It
was a tmp hack anyway.
it doesn't contain the #if HZ==1000 fix in timer.c. I'm not sure if it
is that important and this one is broke since it fixes yet another HZ
value instead of all.

I missed a two or three cases. Hoever, no sign of the tenfold size increase
or any fixes inside SCSI ioctls or firewall rules (netfilter code I presume).
Arjan, are you sure?
