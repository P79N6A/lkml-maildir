We'd love to be able to view and manipulate resource information from
HAL.  As HAL replaces vendor-specific solutions such as, say, kudzu, it
will need to make device/driver decisions and implement work arounds, so
this information is incredibly invaluable, let alone just neat to have.
Note _requiring_ user-space to implement the resource allocation
strategy is an entirely different path, and I am not arguing that.  We'd
like to read it, if nothing else.
