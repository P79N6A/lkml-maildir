Legal is steering for shoal water and ordering up steam.
In this thread you described some of your products with
justifiable pride. Legal will need to expand a *lot* if you
ship medical or ATC subsystems with development kernels.
More on topic, it is useless to the point of misleading the
customer if you ship source which doesn't correspond to
what's in the product. My understanding of GPL is that
source must match binaries.
IANAL, BTW
Good luck,
Tom
