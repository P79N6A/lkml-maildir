Hi all,
My machine sometimes crashes completely when reading or writing a CD 
with my SCSI burner. I thought for ages that it was a hardware problem,
but this week I tried FreeBSD on it to make sure. Now I think it's a 
problem with Linux.
In FreeBSD I copied the contents of ten CDs to the hard drive without
a problem. In Linux 2.4.4 I attempted copying four of these CDs, resulting
in three crashes. Then I tried in 2.2.19, where I experienced one crash
from three copies. At this point I got sick of waiting for fsck.
I'm using a Tekram DC310 SCSI card (sym53c8xx driver) and Matshita CW-7503 
burner on a Duron 750 with Epox 8KTA3+ motherboard. 
I'd really like to get this working because not being able to burn with my
burner is sub-optimal. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers,
Steven
