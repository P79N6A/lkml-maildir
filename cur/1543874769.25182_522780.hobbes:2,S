I've tried RSDLv.31+this on 2.6.20.3 as i'm not tracking -mm.

I'm not sure this is going in the right direction... I'm writing
this while compiling a kernel w/ "nice -20 make -j2" and X is almost
unusable -- even the x pointer jumps instead of moving smoothly like
it always did; I had to stop the build to be able to quickly finish
this as the latency is making it hard to properly position the cursor...
Hmm, this is weird; I've tried various nice values for the build and
19 is the only one triggering this, w/ 18 and less the cursor moves
smoothly, but there are short sub-second stalls. nice=0 isn't much
different.
RSDL 0.31 was behaving properly, and only exhibited problems when
the box was overloaded w/ non-niced tasks; Right now even a properly
niced background job kills interactivity completely.
