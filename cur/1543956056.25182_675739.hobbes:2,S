Yes, it would be, but worth the trouble. Is it really critical to move a dead
cgroup leader to init_css_set in cgroup_exit()?

I probably can write a program and see what the overhead looks like

Finding the next mm might not be all that bad, but doing it each time a task
exits, can be an overhead, specially for large multi threaded programs. This can
get severe if the new mm->owner belongs to a different cgroup, in which case we
need to use callbacks as well.
If half the threads belonged to a different cgroup and the new mm->owner kept
switching between cgroups, the overhead would be really high, with the callbacks
and the mm->owner changing frequently.

You are right about the read_lock()
