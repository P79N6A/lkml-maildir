It seems obvious to me that people are waving around soft qualitative
words when the reality is that only a quantitative specification is
possible. And nothing is 100%, it is always a distribution of
potential results. Any modern processor will have fluctuations in the
sub-microsecond range. A work of ram might have a single-bit error
[Thank you Mr X-ray from some collapsing star] and take a bit more
time then usual to do the ECC logic.  A program proving system *might*
have an error. Every proper analysis should include an error estimate.
So an operating environment must have some
estimated/measured/calculated results from which an estimate can be
made on whether certain workload can be processed in the time alotted.
An audio application will have one requirement, flying an airplane is
another...  All this hand-waving about hard versus soft RT just
exposes the prejudices and experience of each writer.
No offence...
