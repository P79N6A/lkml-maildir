I fixed this a few weeks back. It's this line which your patch removes..

If we need users to pass extra command line args to make warnings go
away, we may as well not bother. Because 99% of users will be completely
unaware that option even exists.  They'll still see the same message,
and still report the same bugs.
The pains of MTRR strike again. This stuff is just screaming for
a usable PAT implementation. Andi, you were working on that, any news ?
Or should I resurrect Terrence's patch again ?
