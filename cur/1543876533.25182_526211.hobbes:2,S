The discussions on the list helped clear up a lot of issues.

I will try again  Vatsa's suggestion of having a 
if (freezing(current))
	freeze_process(p);
in copy processes() and check if we can do away with the fork race. 
That sounds lot simpler than the scheduler hooks.

From what I can make out, we fail to freeze if we have some task in
the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state for more than the timeout period. 
The kernel threads have to call try_to_freeze() explicitly and for the
userspace tasks, try_to_freeze() is called in get_signal_to_deliver().
The system is considered frozen only when *all* the freezeable tasks
call try_to_freeze() one way or the other. This is unlikely in case of
a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE task.
Question is can we have some task in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state for such
a long duration (20sec) ??
