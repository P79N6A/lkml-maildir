S/PDIF and MPU are not usable until Trident updates the documentation.
Description of registers MPUR0-MPUR3 (MPU) and I2SR (probably S/PDIF) are
missing.
It does do streaming audio well enough, and has reasonably clean analogue
output. The ALSA drivers work well with my Hoontech 4DWave-NX.
It is unknown at this time whether the S/PDIF is capable of 1:1 output.
