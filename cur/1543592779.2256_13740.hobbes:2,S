	Apart from this stupid flame that I'm making, I've got my
Intel/Symbol card to work properly with the Orinoco driver. This mean
that we are not far away to have the 4 main flavor of 802.11b working
in 2.4.X (i.e. Lucent/Symbol/PrismII/Aironet).
	See :
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Orinoco.html#patches
	Just to make sure we end on a positive note ;-) Now, if I
could get the card of Alan to work...
	Have fun, don't take it seriously...
	Jean
