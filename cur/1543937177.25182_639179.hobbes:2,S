The current dm-loop patch was really written to demonstrate the value of
block-mapping as an alternative to doing file backed I/O via the pagecache.
Personally, I would like to see a single "loopback block devices" driver
in the kernel with loop.c and dm-loop as alternate interfaces to it.
There seems to be some demand for this, e.g.:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5333
And numerous similar posts to dm-devel (although I think obsoleting may
be going a bit far to start with!).
Regards,
Bryn.
