Even _I_ don't have that kind of list. 
It's on a case-by-case basis (although with certain developers, the cases 
tend to be pretty clear-cut), and it literally changes over time. Some 
people use throw-away trees that are just used for some particular set, 
and I merge them (or not), and they go away.
