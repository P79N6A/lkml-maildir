With normal custom kernels at 1.5 MB (before compression) already,
I don't see this as a problem. It is likely that the map size could
be reduced much more by elimination of data symbols.

OK, so I have two kernels now. Both are version 2.3.18, both have
the same patches, and both are builds from fresh tarballs. They
differ only by config option. (not an unusual case)
Bad enough? I may as well also mention that the kernel which is
running may have been booted off of a floppy drive or network,
and that / may be a read-only filesystem.
