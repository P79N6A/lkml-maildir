it shows:
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
 2092 ttyp0    S      0:00 su guest -c ps $PPID;wc -m </proc/$PPID/cmdline
      0
but cat shows:
su guest -c 'ps $PPID; cat /proc/$PPID/cmdline'
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
 2144 ttyp0    S      0:00 su guest -c ps $PPID; cat /proc/$PPID/cmdline
suguest-cps $PPID; cat /proc/$PPID/cmdline
what happened?

it shows:
localhost root # strace -fewrite su -c /bin/echo 2>&1 | grep pid

Looks like my results are slightly diffent, Does this mean i did not apply the 
patch correctly? I applied it twice manually, because patch did not succeed 
and compiled the kernel 3 times...
