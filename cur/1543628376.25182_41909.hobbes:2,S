Hi ,
While debugging last night with Brian O'Sullivan I found this beauty.
char *in_ntoa(__u32 in)
{
        static char buff[18];
        char *p;
        p = (char *) &in;
        sprintf(buff, "%d.%d.%d.%d",
                (p[0] & 255), (p[1] & 255), (p[2] & 255), (p[3] & 255));
        return(buff);
}
This textbook peice of novice coding which has existed since 2.2.14.
For those who can't spot the error, please note that this function is 
returning a static string, excellent stuff if you are hoping to reuse the 
same function like the following
printk("%s %s\n",in_ntoa(addr1),in_ntoa(addr2));
