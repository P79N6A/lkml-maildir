I saw that same message in 2.6.0-t3. Sometimes immediately the netcard 
would not ping
and sometimes it would fail after a while.
Do you see an "irq ? disabled" message, too? That would be typical.
Try turning apic off in bios-cmos-setup and letting linux turn it on. I 
don't have to use drastic
pci=noacpi, I can just disable serial and parallel and USB and turn apic 
off in bios and run
with no cd drives. Easier for me.
