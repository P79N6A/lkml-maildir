Hi
Because of gmx.de, which I until yesterday used for all mailing lists, 
including vger, I lost 6 days of lkml traffic. I would be very greatful if 
anyone could send me those 6 days - 21-23 July and 17-19 August in mbox 
format. Please, if you're going to do it, first ask if I haven't got the 
files from someone else yet:-)
Thanks
Guennadi
