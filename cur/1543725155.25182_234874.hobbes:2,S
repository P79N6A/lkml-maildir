Correct, but take a second look at the code (2.6):
        void *ret;
        /* ignore region specifiers */
        gfp &= ~(__GFP_DMA | __GFP_HIGHMEM);
        if (dev == NULL || (dev->coherent_dma_mask < 0xffffffff))
                gfp |= GFP_DMA;
        ret = (void *)__get_free_pages(gfp, get_order(size));
It uses GFP_DMA iff your coherent_dma_mask is != 0xffffffff.  Assuming
your device can address a the full 32-bit PCI address space, you
need to set the coherent_dma_mask appropriately and you will get
buffers from all addressable lowmem. I don't do much x86, so not
sure how you go about allocating highmem DMA buffers.

If you are using alloc_bootmem_low(), all you should have to do after
allocating the memory is call pci_dma_map_single()/map_sg() to get PCI-DMA 
addresses. You still should have no reason to touch MAX_DMA_ADDRESS.
