Wow, I act as the maintainer for a couple weeks, and I already am having
a decision appealed to the supreme court ;-)

There are a number of changes that are needed in that interface for this 
and other reasons.  Some others:
  * The PHYs should be able to propagate link-up/link-down state for 
    physical layers that have a strong connection-oriented basis (DSL)
  * DSL PHYs can support variable link rates which the SAR may need to
    change timing for.
  * Devices that live on a packet-based bus (i.e. USB DSL modems) may
    want the PHY to queue read/writes into blocks.  Currently doing
    a PHY-initiated firmware upload through the current read8/write8
    interface would be pretty painful.  I'm not sure if this is best 
    done by offering a "read/write block" operation or a "set of commands"
    operation.
  * Some PHY error conditions require it to initiate a SAR reset
So eather we're going to add a lot of function pointers to atm_dev->ops
or we need to move to a more generalized request interface, ala:
        struct phy_event {
                enum phy_event_type type;
                union {
                        u32 val;
                        u8 *u8p;
                        u16 *u16p;
                        u32 *u32p;                                      
                }
        };
        
So the options now are:
  (1) Go to an all-new interface now.  Bad idea - I'm not even 100% sure
      what I want it to look like yet.  It's still a work in progress.
      2.5 thing.
  (2) Extend the current interface to add read16/write16 to get around
      your issue.  Not a terrible idea, but not one I'm particularly fond 
      of either.
  (3) Do nothing and let Linus et al actually ship 2.4.0.  I really
      like this option.  I am under no delusion that the ATM stack is
      a high priority for Linus at this moment, so I don't want to send
      him any patches that are anything but pure bug fix (I guess I'm
      old fashioned, but I actually care about code freezes)
There are at least two workable ways to work around this limitation in your
driver:
   *  Use the gross hack I emailed you earlier (implement a 8-bit pseudo
      register that just contains the MSB of the next value written).
      Yes, this is very gorss, but at least it's a localized gross,
      and will go away in 2.5
   *  Don't implement the PHY as a seperate driver - just combine it with
      your SAR driver.  The entire point of having them seperate is that
      the same PHY will often be used by several different SAR chips.
      Since yours would currently be the only SAR supporting the 16-bit
      interface, there is little to gain by having the drivers seperate.

Many have tried :-)
