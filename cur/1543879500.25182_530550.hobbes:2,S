Documentation/ is handled explicit i top-level Makefile:
mrproper-dirs      := $(addprefix _mrproper_,Documentation/DocBook scripts)
PHONY += $(mrproper-dirs) mrproper archmrproper
$(mrproper-dirs):
        $(Q)$(MAKE) $(clean)=$(patsubst _mrproper_%,%,$@)
And we will visit DocBook with mrproper - but not clean.
I have no stron opinion when to delete generated files in DocBook.
