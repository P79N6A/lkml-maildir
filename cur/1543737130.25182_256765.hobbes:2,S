It seems that the actual patent describes the implementation of the
scheduler that achieves this. And in it, the method used is a locked
global queue and unlocked local queues. But anyway.

And probably most cache behaviours. If you have a set of tasks with
a working set larger than the cache of 1 processor but that can be
divided to fit into the cache of 2, then you're laughing.
More than 1 CPU can dramatically lower task switch (and mm switch)
rates in ideal situations, too.

Well it has pretty strong  CPU affinity, and roughly distributes
load evenly over CPUs. What more do you want? :)
