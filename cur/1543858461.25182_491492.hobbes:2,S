And might as well do the mmap work as well. I'm not clear what uio gives
us that a decently written pair of PCI and platform template drivers for
people to use would not do more cleanly.
Also many of these cases you might not want stuff in userspace but the
uio model would push it that way which seems to be an unfortunate side
effect. Yes some probably do want to go that way but not all.
