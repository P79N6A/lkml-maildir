NAK.
When submitting a patch that is the revert of a patch that went 
into Linus' tree just 8 days ago [1], I'd expect at least:
- a Cc to the people involved with the patch you are reverting
- a note that you are reverting a recent patch in your patch
  description
- an explanation why you disagree with the patch you are reverting
If you disagree with a patch, please speak up when it's submitted or 
discuss it after you've seen it in the tree. But don't play such silly
revert-and-hope-they-don't-notice-I've-reverted-it games.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
