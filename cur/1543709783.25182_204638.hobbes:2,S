You need a  sync  instruction before the instruction cache invalidate,
to make sure all stores to L2 have completed.
I don't know which "970fx specs" you mean, but if it's the programming
manual, it should tell you how to invalidate the entire instruction
cache (and how to flush the L2 cache, if you really must.  But just 
don't).
