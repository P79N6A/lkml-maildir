Now, would it be possible to have somewhere listed the URLs of git/quilt 
trees that were merged? The commit messages about merges with different 
branches aren't too informative, it might sometime be useful to know more 
about the trees that were merged.
Maybe just an additional file somewhere in the root of the source tree 
would be sufficient ...
Thanks,
