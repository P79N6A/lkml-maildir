I have just had a frustrating experience, solely blameable on my
own stupidity.
Basically, I'd been assuming that stopping after "booting kernel" was
due to some corruption, rather than the obvious, of checking that I had
indeed selected the right processor when compiling.
What about "booting the kernel for i386" ?
