The sensors conf for the S2875 provided by Tyan only displays
3 FAN RPM values while the board has at least 4. At the moment I'm
using 3 fans with tacho signal but can only determine 2 values, the
third value is constantly 0.
Also the setup puzzles me a bit; why would Tyan pack several SMBus
setups into a single motherboard but only connect devices to one
of them. Actually sensors-detect claims that there is one
unrecognized client on the "unused" SMBus.
Servus,
