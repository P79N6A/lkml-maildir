Actually it does have some significance - it causes a return, then the
following text overwrites the current text. Granted, this is only used
occasionally for generating bold/underline/... 
This is used in some formatters (troff) occasionally, though it tends to
use backspace now.
\r is not considered whitespace, though it should be possible to define
it that way. A line terminator is always \n.
Another point, is that the "#!/bin/sh" can have options added: it can be
"#!/bin/sh -vx" and the option -vx is passed to the shell. The space is
not just "stripped". It is used as a parameter separator. As such, the
"stripping" is only because the first parameter is separated from the
command by whitespace.
