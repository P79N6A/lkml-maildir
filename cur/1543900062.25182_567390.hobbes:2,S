thx! I'll check this tomorrow, meanwhile here are a few quick ideas.
1) does reverting this patch improve performance:
   commit 9c4801cebc2add1fe514bc8eb201b16372eee11a
   Author: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
   Date:   Mon Jul 9 18:52:01 2007 +0200
       sched: more agressive idle balancing
2) does changing CONFIG_HZ=250 to CONFIG_HZ=100 improve the numbers? 
   CFS has some internal tuning that depends on HZ - a higher HZ is a 
   sign that the user wants more finegrained scheduling. So for maximum 
   server throughput, use CONFIG_HZ=100.
3) could you turn off CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG? The cost is small but perhaps 
   measurable.
(these 3 suggestions could be tested together - they should have 
cumulative effects.)
