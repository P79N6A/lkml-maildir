Hi,
I'm facing a similar issue like the thread
system keeps freezing once every 24 hours / random apps crashing
reported, but I still have to try all those suggestions.
For now, I've configured a serial console and enabled SysReq. When the 
freeze happens on my system, the system is still pingable and SysReq can 
for example sync the disks. I also can see on serial console which 
SysReq command I selected (registers, tasks, SAK, etc.), but I do not 
get any output of these commands on serial console.
When issuing such a SysReq command before the system freezes I can see 
the output of the command on a framebuffer console.
So, is it possible to redirect the output of a SysReq command to a 
serial console?
Bye.
