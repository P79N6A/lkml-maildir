It does better whitespace cleanup, than
scripts/{cleanfile *and* cleanpatch}
togather with more user, operating system kernel-friendly approach.
Please, test it on proposed testcase - ipv6.h, and you will see, what i'm

start use it *safely*.

For those, who have (X)emacs on board, i recommend "develock.el" as

Sorry, Andrew, for garbage in you patch subject filters :)
