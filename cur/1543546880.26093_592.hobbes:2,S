Hi,
I was looking at using kernel debugger in which putting breakpoints and
step through is possible. I am using SuSE linux 6.2 kernel version
2.2.14. I downloaded the xkdebug patch from 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/
patched my kernel and did a "make install". I also did make modules and
make modules_install after that. But when I start the script xkgdb in
/usr/src/linux/xkgdb it gives me error. I error shown is as below.
Kindly reply with your suggestions.

Try `mknod --help' for more information.
gdb 4.16 gets confused by *.o files that were compiled with debugging
information (-g).  This makes it too risky to run xkdebug on loaded
modules so, until the gdb problem is fixed, xkgdb does not load symbols
for modules.  If any debugging expert can solve this problem, read the
xkgdb script for more details.
