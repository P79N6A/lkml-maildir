Possibly. Also, the simpler case of wraparound needs to be handled. Since
one delay sample isn't significant, dropping it seemed the safest bet.

TASK_DELAY_ACCOUNTING is better since thats what the code protected
does.
STATS_CONNECTOR can be used to transmit stats other than per-task
delays (current patch also transmits cpu run time). Also there's a possibility
that the overall per-task accounting solution whose discussion was proposed
by Andrew will deviate from delays. So how about TASK_STATS_CONNECTOR.
Will fix in next round.

Doing so would have value in the case where the feature is configured but
no one ever registers to listen for it. The cost of doing this would be
- adding more code to the fork path to allocate conditionally
- make the collecting of the delays conditional on a similar check
- cache pollution from following an extra pointer in the pgflt/io_schedule paths
I'm not sure is this really matters for these two code paths.
Even if one does this, once the first listener registers, all future tasks
(and even the current ones) will have to go ahead and allocate the structure
and accounting of delays will have to switch to unconditional mode. This is
because the delay data has cumulative value...future listeners will be
interested in data collected earlier (as long as task is still running). And
once the first listener registers, you can no longer be sure no one's interested
in the future.
Another alternative is to let userland control the overhead of allocation and
collection completely through a /proc/sys/kernel/delayacct variable.
When its switched on, it triggers an allocation for all existing tasks in the
system, turns on allocation in fork() for future tasks, and collection of the stats.
When turned off, collection of stats stops as does allocation for future tasks
(not worth going in and deallocating structs for existing tasks).
Does this seem worth it ?
