 Well, I don't really use any distribution anymore (although I look at
them for patches from time to time), yet I still believed it's long
abandoned.  A regex search of FTP sites for procps-.*\.tar\.(gz|bz2) 
yields anything from 0.92 up to 2.0.7 but nothing newer and tsx-11 at MIT
still has 2.0.3 only.  It really doesn't hurt to make a release from time
to time if you maintain anything...
