It sounds practical.  Why stop there?  Since Ted is seriously considering 
making a batch of incompatible extensions to the on-disk format anyway, how 
about adding an atime table to each block group, four bytes per inode.  Even 
without lazy updating, it would cut down the dirty  blocks generated by r/o 
operations a lot.  If actual atime is the latest of the atime table value and 
the inode atime value[1], then inode write operations won't generate extra 
traffic.  You will only get new traffic when somebody wants the real atime.  
I'd put this under the category of "things to add to Ted's long list of fun 
new ideas for Ext3/4".
[1] How to handle wrapping is left as an exercise for the interested reader.
