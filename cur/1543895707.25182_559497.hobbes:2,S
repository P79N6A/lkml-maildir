Whilst testing a potential bug in another thread I accidentally found that 
unmounting a filesystem that I'd just frozen would hang.
As the saying goes: "Well, duh!!"
I could eventually run an unfreeze but the mount was still hung. This lead to an 
unclean shutdown.
OK, it may not be bright but it seems like this shouldn't happen; umount should 
either unfreeze and work or fail ("Attempt to umount a frozen filesystem.") if 
the fs is frozen.
Is this a kernel bug/misfeature or a (u)mount one?
Suggestions as to the best place to report it if not in the cc's?
David
