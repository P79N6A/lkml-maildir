    It's because you're using the Wrong Library(tm):
root@india.pell.portland.or.us# cc -baout -m386 -static -O -s -o testy testy.c
root@india.pell.portland.or.us# ls -l testy
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  root  16384 Jan 09 15:58 testy
root@india.pell.portland.or.us# ldd testy
        statically linked
    And this is only because libc's exit() code drags in stuff to shut
    down std{in|out|err}, which fouls an amazingly large amount of code.
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ add printf("hello,sailor\n"); and the code bloats
                   \/                                          up to 52k :-(
