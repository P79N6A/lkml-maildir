If during the stalls the disk is writing to disk at full speed (not idle),
then I agree the right fix is to unplug the queue before putting kflushd
to sleep (after all it makes sense to do the I/O while the disk is
otherwise idle).
However I'm also worried by the size of the queues, maybe the high latency
is a sign that the queue is too big (5 seconds at 20mbyte/sec are
100mbytes of stuff into the I/O queue, are you really waiting 5 seconds
while the disk is writing?).
