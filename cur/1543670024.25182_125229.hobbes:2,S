Hello
Since 2.5.60, I have been experiencing problems with a complete system freeze or random oopses when the X-server terminates. It is happening on both machines I am using whose hardware configuration differs slightly, however both of them are equipped with ATI video cards (ATI Rage 128 and ATI Radeon 8500), and both of them run the same version of X-server. That's about all they have in common.
The version of X-server I am using is:
XFree86 Version 4.3.0
Release Date: 27 February 2003
Since the crash either results in an oops obviously not having to do with the core problem, or the system freezes dead (no ping, no reaction to SysRq key), I don't know how to get some debug information to describe the fault more precisely.
Has anyone notyiced similar problems and is there some documentation how to trace such deadly bugs ?
