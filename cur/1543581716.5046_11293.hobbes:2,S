I am no kernel hacker, but I would like to file a bug-report none the
less. Please CC me with follow-ups (if any ;-) since I am not
subscribing to the mailing list.
I have a Xircom Combo CardBus (32 bit) 10/100 Ethernet Card + 56k
Modem (didn't try the modem part) that I have not been able to run
under 2.2.18 or 2.4.0. The weird part is that everything seems to load
fine, and I am able to configure the card with an ip-address and
everything. Only sad part is that I can not reach out to the world. I
just get connection time-outs when trying to acces the 'net.
The card runs fine under 2.2.17, but not with pcmcia-cs package
version later than 3.1.20 (I do realize that this probably have little
to do with the kernel).
BTW, The driver used by the card is tulip_cb, and the machine it runs
on is a Dell Latitude CPx H500GT.
Regards, Stig
