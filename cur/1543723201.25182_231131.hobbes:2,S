Hi all.
Sorry. Wasn't sure if this short of thing should be raised on bugtracker 
or not... Basically I downloaded 2.6.7-mm4 because I found a kernel bug 
that was apparently fixed in -mm2 (& hopefully later) where the acpi 
button events get 'lost' after a suspend-resume.
It appears that the -=mm4 patch introduces a bug however where it won't 
compile unless local apic is defined due to the following

apic_write seems to be defined in apic.h & ifdef'ed out if local apic is 
not selected, however there are several calls to it that aren't ifdef'ed 
out...
Turning on local apic means the kernel compiles... But in the past this 
introduces a power down bug on the thinkpad where a shutdown won't power 
off the laptop without a manual off using the power button (Sorry. 
Haven't had a chance to test whether this would be fixed in -mm4 or not 
yet).
regards
  Hamish.
