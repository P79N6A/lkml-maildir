I've some more data on this.  I'd had been some time until I was able
to get a 2.5 to boot enough to run X....
Anyway, at 2.5.50 + a few csets, I had a spot where gpm could see the
nib iff /dev/mouse was symlinked to /dev/input/mice (c 13 63) but not
if it was linked to /dev/psaux (c 10 1) as it had been.
I hoped from that that X would also work, but I've not been able to
replicate that success even with gpm.  I don't know what magic insmod
made the difference (I wasn't trying to get it to work at the time,
just accidently hit the nib while at run level 3 and saw the gpm
cursor...).
As for a susend/resume cycle, this box has never been happy to do that.
