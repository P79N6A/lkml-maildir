We been staring at these numbers for while now and we come to the conclusion they wrong.
The test is f is 3 tasks, two on different and one on same cpu as sh here:
virgin 2.6.21-rc3-rsdl-smp
top - 13:52:50 up 7 min, 12 users,  load average: 3.45, 2.89, 1.51
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  P COMMAND
 6560 root      31   0  2892 1236 1032 R   82  0.1   1:50.24 1 sh
 6558 root      28   0  1428  276  228 S   42  0.0   1:00.09 1 f
 6557 root      30   0  1424  280  228 R   35  0.0   1:00.25 0 f
 6559 root      39   0  1424  276  228 R   33  0.0   0:58.36 0 f
6560 sh is asking for 100% cpu on cpu number 1
6558 f is asking for 50% cpu on cpu number 1
6557 f is asking for 50% cpu on cpu number 0
6559 f is asking for 50% cpu on cpu number 0
So if 6560 and 6558 are asking for cpu from cpu number 1:
6560 wants 100% and 6558 wants 50%.
6560 should get 2/3 cpu 6558 should get 1/3 cpu
2.6.21-rc3-rsdl-smp gives 65% sh and 35% f
patched 2.6.21-rc3-rsdl-smp gives 60% sh and 40% f
2.6.20.3-smp gives 51% sh and 49% f
We think cpu correctness is 2.6.21-rc3-rsdl-smp
 in that test.
