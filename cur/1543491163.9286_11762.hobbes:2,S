This is an old mail I came across while cleaning out my mail box.  I
suspect that someone out there cares.
-----------
I was attempting to figure out the relative sizes of the various operating
systems and/or distributions out there so I spent a while wandering through
resources on the net.  In particluar, I did a series of queries on Deja News
to see who talks about what.  I just typed in keywords and searched both
their recent and past news posting archives (for anyone who doesn't know,
Deja News is a company which archives all news postings [maybe not adult,
I don't know for sure] and indexes them in such a way that you can quickly
look up topics).
This is hardly scientific and meaningful if your goal is to know how many
seats there are out there.  On the other hand, it's very scientific if
your goal is to know how many people are asking questions in net news
about a particular topic.  What conclusions you draw from that is up
to you.

What does this mean?  Just that this is the distribution of news postings
made by people about these topics.  Does it correlate to distribution
of seats?  There's no way to know for sure but I'll bet there is some
correlation if we consider only the Unix seats.  We know that there are
more Microsoft seats unless Windows is nothing more than a big marketing
campaign.  Still, it is surprising how little discussion there is about
Windows.  Perhaps that is because people use a different keyword to describe
windows and I didn't find that or perhpas it is because Windows as an operating
system topic is uninteresting.  Or maybe something else, who knows?
