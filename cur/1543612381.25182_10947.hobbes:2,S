Rik, i think you're confused about lockless algos.
It's not an rwlock where the reader has to dirty a cacheline in any case,
the reader simply does _not_ write any cache line accessing the
list/hash/tree or whatever you use.
These algo uses barries and all changes are done when the system walk
through a quiescent state by flushing a list-of-changes.
Drawback, you've to be able to tollerate stale data.
