There is no way in _hell_ that the correct way to handle this is by doing 
magic things at execve() time. Stop that NOW!
First off, a program had better be correctly startable even if the 
process that does the execve() is _not_ using the new glibc. If I have an 
old "bash" binary, and that means that I cannot start up new binaries 
correctly, that is BROKEN. It's so incredibly broken that it's scary.
Why not do it the _sane_ way, with a system call in crt0.S instead to set 
up the user_tid if you want it?
This patch is crap, or at least needs a ton more explanation about why you 
would do something that looks quite this horrible and stupid.
