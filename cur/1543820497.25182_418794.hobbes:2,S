I'd prefer (given that there aren't any unused ptrace arguments) using
the operation for this - PTRACE_SYSCALL_MASK_TRACE,
PTRACE_SYSCALL_MASK_IGNORE.  We'd need better names than these
horribly over-long ones, though.

I think that's just building in fragility whenever userspace doesn't
happen to match the kernel.  Both UML and strace will know what system
calls they are interested in.  Having the kernel 1- or 0-extend the
mask will automatically do the right thing.  If userspace is newer
than the kernel, and asks for special treatment for system calls that
don't exist, then it should get a -EINVAL.
