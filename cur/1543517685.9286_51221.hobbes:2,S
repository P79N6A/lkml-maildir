Lsof choked because of a mounted file system. It printed this message:
-
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() of file system /mnt/media/audio/Cradle
      Output information may be incomplete.
-
Actually, it refered to a file system mounted like (according to mtab):
/dev/hdb4 /mnt/media/audio/Cradle\040of\040Filth ext2 rw 0 0
But lsof reads (and tries to parse) /proc/mounts, that reports the file systems mounted as:
/dev/hdb4 /mnt/media/audio/Cradle of Filth ext2 rw 0 0
Like lsof, other programs might be unable to parse this information. If this file is supposed to be computer parsed, the separators should be changed to something else, or the spaces in a filed escaped like in /etc/{fstab,mtab}.
