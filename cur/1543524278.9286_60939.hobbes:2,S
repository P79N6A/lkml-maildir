mmhh...
i had very similar problems with e2fsck-1.1.8:
e2fsck-1.18 failed to check one single partition (hda3). I finally found that
the problems occurred when
1. during boot no zip-disk was in my zip-drive (hdb)
and
2. the partition which was checked was > 2 GB
my recent solution is to insert a zip-floppy into hdb before turning power on
