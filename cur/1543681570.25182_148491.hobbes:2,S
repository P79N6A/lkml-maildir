Nope, never.

It already is enabled.  When this happens, nothing is printed in the logs
until I unplug the mouse.

Should it be possible for X to lock up the mouse?  When the mouse stops
working in X, it seems to stop working for everything else too (the "cat
/dev/input/mice" test, at least).

Is there anything besides this I can do to try and figure out what's going
on?
