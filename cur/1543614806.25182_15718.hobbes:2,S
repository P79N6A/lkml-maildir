No no no.
The comments can at least be helpful to programmers, whether ripped out or
not.
Extra stuff is not helpful to anybody, and is just really irritating. I
personally despise source trees that start out with one page of copyright
statement crap, it just detracts from the real _point_ of the .c file,
which is to contain C code. Making it a comment requirement is
 - stupid:
	we have a filesystem, guys
 - slow:
	we don't need to parse every C file we encounter when we can just
	open another file based on filename
 - nonsensical:
	many config options are _not_ limited to one C file
 - hard to parse and read:
	why limit ourself to C comments, when just keeping the thing
	logically separated means that we don't have to.
Having per-function comment blocks, in contrast, makes sense to have
inline:
 - you read the comment when you read the function
 - you might even update the comment when you update the function
 - you have a reasonable 1:1 relationship.
_None_ of those are sensible for config file entries.
