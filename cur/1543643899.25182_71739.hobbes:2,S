   I don't see why they should be.  If it is a pci device the cost should
   the same as a pci memory I/O.  The bus packets are the same.  So things like
   increasing the pci bus speed should make it take less time.
The x86 processor has a well defined timing for executing inb
etc. instructions, the timing is fixed and is independant of the
speed of the PCI bus the device is on.
