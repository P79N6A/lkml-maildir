the changes 's/CHILD_PENALTY/CHILD_INHERITANCE' and "s/PARENT_PENALTIY//' are 
really awfull for desktops. If I change child_inheritance from 60 to 95 and 
reintroduce the logic with parent_penaltiy, it's alot smooter under load.
I think these logics should be #ifdef'ed with CONFIG_DESKTOP, no?
ciao, Marc
