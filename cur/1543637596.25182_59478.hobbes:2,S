Shit - you are right. We look until the next request sets IDE_BUSY as a 
side effect.... I just wanted to close the window between clear we clear
IDE_BUSY in ata_irq_handler just before recalling do_request to set it 
immediately on again.
Should be both of course.

Yes theoretically yes. The problem is only that queue_lock doesn't as
advertized becouse the request_fn are *releasing* the spin lock at a 
point where the QUEUE_FLAG_STOP doesn't have any usefull value.
