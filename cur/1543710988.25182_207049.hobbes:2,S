I'm one of the right people to ask about EVMS. Please send questions to 
evms-devel@lists.sf.net and the whole group will be able to provide 
assistance.
EVMS will recognize and manage software raid devices, but currently doesn't 
support expanding raid-5 devices. It's on our list for later this year. I 
believe there's a stand-alone tool available that will let you do this 
(google for raidreconf).
