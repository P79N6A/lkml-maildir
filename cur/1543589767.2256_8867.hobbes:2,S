Brilliant. 
It seems that there needs to be a way of detecting the
presence of the feature at compile-time,  so you
can do
#ifndef HAVE_CT_ASSERT
#define __builtin_ct_assert(a, b) do{}while(0)
#endif
or whatever.
Apart from that, I'd suggest you fill out the FSF
damage waiver and see if you can make this part of
stock gcc.
