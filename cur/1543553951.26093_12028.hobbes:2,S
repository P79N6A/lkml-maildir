Setting bit 1 in dev->resource[x].start, below, seems incorrect.  Should
you be programming the PCI BAR directly, instead?

I wonder about this code:

I think "pdev_enable_device" is a poorly-chosen name, since "pdev_" is
not a common prefix, and we already have pci_enable_device.
Also, should we be setting PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE for PCI devices as well
as bridges?
