  Hello,
  this is Cogito version 0.16.3, the next stable release of the
human-friendly version control UI for the Linus' GIT tool. Share
and enjoy at:

  All the fixes are of minor to normal severity. Pretty boring, and
that's what I love on the release the most - it seems that we are in a
quite stable state now. However, I am probably going to disrupt that
state with the v0.17 release, hopefully very soon - I got so used to it
that I wouldn't realize all the v0.16 users were deprived of the goodies
like cg-switch.
Michael Richardson:
      Mark that gawk (not mawk) is required for cg-diff -c
      Only show the fetch progress bar on terminals
Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso:
      Fix unconditional early exit of cg-fetch over rsync, v2
Petr Baudis:
      Fix cg-push not always defaulting to 'master' remotely
      Make it possible to push out new branches
      Fix cg-clone -l of specific branch
      Make cg-fetch return false if fetch_tags fails.
      cogito-0.16.3
  Happy hacking,
