When I wrote a patch to treat lru_lock (it was not per-zone yet.), I got a
comment to use irqsafe version. So I wonder there is some plan which needs
irq safe locking.
About mem_cgroup_isolate_pages(), zone->lock is acquired with irq-disable 
before it is called. Then, it's not necesary there.
But as you say, it looks we can do it without irq-disable, now.

Ah...it seems bug. We should add type handling in uncharge. 
Then, changing control_type after start using mem_cgroup seems dangerous.
(Default is ALL now.)
Maybe following will be fix.
- allow changing contorl_type only when there is no task.
- run force_empty when control_type is changed. and drop all charges.
This will change current behavior but I think it's reasonable.
How do you think ?

As you say, it seems bug. (sigh, my bug..)
I'd like to fix.

I agree with you.
Thank you for review !
