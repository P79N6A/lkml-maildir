Ok, truly bizarre, I found that I was not running stock 2.6.20.3, but
had your small hugetlb patch on top.
So I went back and patched 2.6.20.1 with your patch, rebooted, got a
soft lockup. Went back to stock 2.6.20.1 and did not.
I don't see how your patch (C&P below for reference) could make any
difference...Especially because no hugepages were in use at the time.
On patched 2.6.20.1, I was just trying to check if my source tree had
your patch applied (by `patch -p1 < davem.patch`) and got the
soft-lockup I saw in 2.6.20.3 with the patch applied. I am going to
try a clean 2.6.20.3 as well, now.
