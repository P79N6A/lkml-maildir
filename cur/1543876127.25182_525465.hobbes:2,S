Woah, yeah, neato.  OK, I guess that makes me a lot more willing to
believe any "impossible" error in linux/net/sunrpc/svc.c:svc_process()
is due to random garbage on the network.
I'd definitely like more people to be able to run their nfs server
outside any firewall, so that probably means we should demote these
printk's to dprintk's some day.

Thanks for the followup!
