   Yes, in usual closely coupled SMP systems.

   In its own ways, yes.  It is relying on hardware doing
   it in major part.

   Report the issue with lots of technical details
   on  linux-smp@vger.kernel.org,  and possibly continue
   discussion there.
   Data like:
    - What machine, whose motherboard ?
    - How much memory ?
    - What steppings are the processors ?  (not same ?)
    - How you configured the kernel ?
       (Not quite the entire  .config  file, just first
        50 lines or so telling processor details.)
   And most importantly:
    - Describe why do you suspect there is cache-coherence
      problem in the system ?   In the kernel side, or
      in your application ?   How it is manifesting itself ?
