Well, the "aligned appropriately" part of the comment was intended to let
future users know that something like the above should be done.
e.g in a subsequent patch (5/9)
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0603.1/1919.html
when we introduce the additional stat swapin_delay/count, a 64-bit friendly
alignment is being done thus:
u64 blkio_delay; /* wait for sync block io completion */
+ u64 swapin_delay; /* wait for sync block io completion */
u32 blkio_count;
+ u32 swapin_count;
The need for each stat, potentially, to need a separate set of timespec 
variables
to reduce nesting problems does introduce another wrinkle in 
cache-friendliness
since you'd ideally like to have all the XXX_* variables close together. 
Right now
we're good since swapin doesn't need extra timespecs of its own. But future
additions might need to be more careful.
