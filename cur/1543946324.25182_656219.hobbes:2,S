It doesn't work very reliable for me.
For some reason, it hangs for me sometimes (doesn't remove any files, rm 
-rf just stalls), or segfaults.
As most of the ideas here in this thread assume (re)creating a new 
filesystem from scratch - would perhaps playing with 
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio and /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio help a bit?
