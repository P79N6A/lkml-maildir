hehe - I got it from kernel.org and even sent off a one-liner against 
it to fix an error in net/ipv4/syncookies.c before I saw your mail ...
As I saw Roman`s mail about kernel conf 1.3 ("Update to 2.5.45") I thought
"Cool!" and got 2.5.45.tar.gz right away ... hehe - anyway, no harm done ... 
The image didn`t boot though, so I guess I`ll wait until
you release a _real_ 2.5.45 before doing more testing.
