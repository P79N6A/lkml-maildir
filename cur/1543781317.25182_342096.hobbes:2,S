Hello,
I have been successfully running 2.6.11 under Red Hat RHEL4 environment
with no problems at all.  I needed to switch to 2.6.12 and chose
2.6.12.3.  However, I am having problems booting 2.6.12.3.  My SCSI HBAs
& disks are not being found at boot time and I see these errors during
boot:
Red Hat nash version 4.1.18 starting
Mkrootdev: label / not found
Umount /sys failed: 16
Mount: error 19 mounting ext3
Mount: error 2 mounting none
Switchroot: mount failed: 22
Umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
After trying many many things I have figured out what works and what
doesn't.  
Works:
If I build scsi_mod, sd_mod, scsi_transport_spi and aic7xxxx drivers as
built into the kernel, 2.6.12.3 boots fine.
Doesn't work:
If I build scsi_mod, sd_mod, scsi_transport_spi and aic7xxxx drivers as
Modules, 2.6.12.3 fails to boot.
I was able to run with these drivers as Modules in 2.6.11 without ANY
problems.  Has something changed in 2.6.12.3 with regards to finding
SCSI boot disks?
Please CC my work email when responding with your
suggestions/advice/comments. Thanks in advance!
