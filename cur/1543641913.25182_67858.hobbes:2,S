No, we don't agree.
I see that some people would like to remove it from the kernel, and I'm 
not violently opposed to it if it can be done without breaking existing 
behaviour.
But I do _not_ see any really fundamental reason why the kernel shouldn't
parse the partition tables. I see a lot of problems if the kernel were to 
stop, and I don't see a lot of advantages to not doing so.

That's a bad argument. It's not as if we want to have random formats for 
this thing. Partitioning is damn important, and it has to be portable 
across different machines and different operating systems. That all means 
that there is absolutely _zero_ incentive to make up a partition format of 
our own, since there are perfectly fine and existing formats.

This is only an argument for doing it on demand, not for dropping it.

And none of these work any better in user space.

You seem to think that kernel space somehow cannot do something that user 
space can. I just don't see the overriding problems you claim.
