it's the site of my file wiper. note the list of situations in which it
definetly will not work. if you really don't want plaintext laying around,
then using an encrypted fs is the only way.
a new version will be out soon, with a couple minor bug fixes. wipe is
mostly useful for wiping a drive you're selling of personal stuff. 
also, don't forget about swap. if, for example, a proc reads the contents of
a file from an encrypted fs into a buffer, the buffer can be written to swap
in plaintext.
