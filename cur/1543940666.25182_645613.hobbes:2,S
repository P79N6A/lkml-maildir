When I wrote this initially, it was a mistake to add a Changelog in the 
first place, but I didn't know better at the time.
If you're going to make changes to this file, please remove all the 
Changelog, instead of adding more entries to it. The "Changelog" should 
be kept by the version control system, and not the source code itself.
The rest of the patch looks ok, though.
