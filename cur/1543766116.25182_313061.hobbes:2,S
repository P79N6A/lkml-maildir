The order in the patch changed a lot. The rc2 patch starts with the
changes in the CREDITS file and the rc3 patch has those starting at line
151839.  This is probably because Linus now uses different tools to
produce these. Maybe you can somehow sort the rc2 patch in the same way
as the rc3 patch (same file order) before using interdiff, that should
solve it.
