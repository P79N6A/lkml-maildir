I've got 12Gigs of storage spanning 4 disks using 2.0.35 (maybe .36?)
running on a 486DX2-66 (until two days ago it used to be a 486sx-25), 8MB of
memory, 40MB IDE boot drive, using a future domain ISA SCSI controller
(using the fdomain driver) that was originally ment for use by a SCSI CDROM.
I had no choice when it came to the card as my other one, an Adaptec 1510a,
didn't see all the drives.  The best that I can tell there was/is some bug
in the 2.0.x kernels with scsi drivers that used the generic scsi device
detection code.  The future domain was usable because some old #if 0'ed out
code within the driver that does its own detection of scsi devices worked.
In any case I got similar messages about timeouts early in this system's
life.  I traced down the problem.  A 3600 40MB scsi drive that I was using
for swapspace apparently caused the timeouts during its operation.  Since I
removed that drive the system has functioned well.  On another couple of
systems I have installed I notice similar timeout problems when the ISA scsi
card was sharing an IRQ with another device, you sound card (if any) may be
using IRQ 5 as well.  If I get a chance I'll do a test run on this system
with a 2.2.x kernel.  I just hope the 8MB's of memory isn't a problem.
