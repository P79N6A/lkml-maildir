So what exactly is the firmware doing with this information?  What I
expected is that if the memory is smaller 4GB it's just use 32bit
descriptors.  If you want to keep that heck do the check _before_ setting
the dma_mask.  If you have a > 32bit dma mask but the firmware can't deal
with the high bits in the dma address actually set it's a bug.  It won't
show up on PCs but pretty much on any complex architecture with an iommu
(like AMD64)

Again, memory model doesn't matter.  For many plattforms dma address
aren't memory addresses.
