Hi to all,
I have one question:
Why does the linux kernel needs GCC for compiling. ?
please mail me what are the reasons that only gcc is used to compile the
kernel ?
If i want to use a compiler other than gcc, how much time it will take to
port the assembly code to the other compilers assembly code ?.
please help,
with best regards,
mahadev
