That's a matter of opinion. 
I'm working on cleaning up the libertas driver as and when I have time,
and the constant rebasing of the git trees effectively means that I
can't just use git as it was intended; I feel that I'm being forced back
into the 1990s by having to deal with sequences of patches instead.
It's such a pain that I'm seriously tempted to push my changes directly
to Linus instead of through the subsystem maintainers.
