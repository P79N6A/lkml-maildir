There is.  I'm not convinced it's a good idea, but maybe someone
smarter can comment on it.
v1 and v2 basically contained the generic code with an extra check
here and there.
int do_shtuff(...)
{
	if (xip)
		do_xip_shtuff(...);
	/* shtuff */
	...
}
v3 contains a copy of the generic code in filemap_xip.c.
int do_shtuff_xip(...)
{
	do_xip_shtuff(...);
	/* shtuff copied from filemap.c */
	...
}
v4 could do something like this:
int __do_generic_shtuff(...)
{
	/* the generic shtuff */
	...
}
int do_shtuff(...)
{
	return __do_generic_shtuff(...);
}
int do_shtuff_xip(...)
{
	do_xip_shtuff(...);
	return __do_generic_shtuff(...);
}
