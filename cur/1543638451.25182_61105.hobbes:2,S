This is why I said
 "Which is what we want in generic_file_read() (and _probably_
  generic_file_write() as well, but that's slightly more debatable)"
The "slightly more debatable" comes exactly from the thing you mention.
The thing is, "read()" on a file doesn't have any side effects outside the
process that does it, so if you kill the process, doing a partial read is
always ok (yeah, you can come up with thread examples etc where you can
see the state, but I think those are so contrieved as to not really merit
much worry and certainly have no existing programs issues).
With write(), you have to make a judgement call. Unlike read, a truncated
write _is_ visible outside the killed process. But exactly like read()
there _are_ system management reasons why you may really need to kill
writers. So the debatable point comes from whether you want to consider a
killing signal to be "exceptional enough" to warrant the partial write.
I can see both sides. I personally think I'd prefer the "if I kill a
process, I want it dead _now_" approach, but this definitely _is_ up for
discussion (unlike the signal handler case).
