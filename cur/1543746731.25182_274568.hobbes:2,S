Colin, you didn't tell us which controller it was ? The NEC one is a
totally normal off-the-shelves controller coming out of D3. The Apple
ones are a bit special tho.

It could be a problem in the code restarting the clocks to the USB cell
in KL (provided it's one of these controller and not the NEC), that
would need some more delay before restarting things...

There is nothing fancy with PPC IRQ delivery. IRQs work on wakeup for
everybody or nobody. It's a problem with the USB chip. (There is no
fancy firmware IRQ routing thing, etc... every device is physically
wired to one of the about 128 IRQ lines of the MPIC).
