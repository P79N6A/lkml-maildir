Alan: With your patch ac12, you add the following to asm/socket.h:
/* Nasty libc5 fixup - bletch */
#if defined(__KERNEL__) || (LIBC_VERSION < 6)
/* Socket types. */
#define SOCK_STREAM	1		/* stream (connection) socket	*/
#define SOCK_DGRAM	2		/* datagram (conn.less) socket	*/
#define SOCK_RAW	3		/* raw socket			*/
#define SOCK_RDM	4		/* reliably-delivered message	*/
#define SOCK_SEQPACKET	5		/* sequential packet socket	*/
#define SOCK_PACKET	10		/* linux specific way of	*/
					/* getting packets at the dev	*/
					/* level.  For writing rarp and	*/
					/* other similar things on the	*/
					/* user level.			*/
#endif					
This doesn't work right on my glib 2.0 system, since LIBC_VERSION is not
defined, my cpp takes (<nothing> < 6) as true. (egcs-2.91.60)
Shouldn't it be something like:
#if defined(__KERNEL__) || !defined(__GLIBC__)
instead of the #if above?
Or something like:
#if defined(__KERNEL__) || ( defined(LIBC_VERSION) && (LIBC_VERSION < 6) )
I'm currently using the former, but I'm not sure which is more "correct".
Ciao!
