No. Linux 2.2 is not expected to have this bug.

No. time-wait never send FINs, just bare ACK.

It should responce right. end_seq == rcv_nxt in the case of retransmitted
FIN, len == th->doff*4 but th->fin == 1. So, it returns TCP_TW_ACK.
So, it looks right, I have no idea what happens in your case.
Apparently, you diagnosed problem wrongly. It would be better
if you sent tcpdump of bad session instead.

Milder change is just to install 2.4. :-)
