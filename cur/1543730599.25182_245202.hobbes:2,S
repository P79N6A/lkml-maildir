Hi,
I am running kernel 2.6.8 and have noticed that in
linux/sem.h the function declarations for sys_semop,
sys_semop etc have been removed (as far as I can see
from 2.6.4 onwards). Now when I compile my code I get
the sys_sem* undefined warning messages. Which header
file do I need to include now to get this support? 
Also when I want to load my module with insmod it
cannot find these symbols.
Thanks for the help.
Arne
