Agreed. CAP_SYSADMIN or somesuch should be required for some of those
IOCTLs, at least on keyboards. I don't see a problem with a digitizing
tablet relaxing that to allow anyone, for example, so it makes sense to punt
this test to the driver level (and not input layer level), or to make it
configurable somehow from the driver level before registering the input
device.

Actually, it is more like "we don't have it, and it is non-trivial to do it
right", if I understood Matthew correctly.

Oh yes, it *is* used, and very much so.
