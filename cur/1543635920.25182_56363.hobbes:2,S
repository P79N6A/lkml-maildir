whether it is easier is matter of taste, however in a situation
where the kernel and 99% of other applications refer to something
as '/dev/scd0' I fail to see any benefit of having another scheme.
Do you want to suggest that all other Linux apps should now use
'-dev x,y,z' instead of normal device names?
There is another problem, with your scsi transport library you
are bypassing normal Linux devices. Try
  mount /dev/scd0 /mnt
  cdrecord -dev 0,0,0 -blank=fast
  ls -al /mnt
Nice? It certainly isn't the fault of Linux if you choose to
bypass normal device usage and it can be very annoying not
only for beginners.
