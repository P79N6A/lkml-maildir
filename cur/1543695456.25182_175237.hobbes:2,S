You 're right. I just tested -test9 and it can fully rmmod the module. I 
recall that in -test5, 7 the module wouldn't be cleaned, but now it's OK. The 
warnings (enabled by the .config option) still appear (several of them). I am 
on a UP, however and don't know if a SMP system would happen to have trouble.
I'll also give your patch a try. 
Thanks.
