No. The current nfs manpages (dated 2 November 2007) have a whole
section on data and metadata coherence and about the trade-offs
involved. That section is explicitly referenced in the description of
the 'noac' mount option. It explains that 'noac' is basically about
disabling caching in order to achieve approximate cache coherent
behaviour when multiple NFS clients need to access files that are being
modified frequently on the server.
Note that 'noac' has _never_ been intended as a default NFS mount
option. The kernel default is rather to cache attributes as aggressively
as possible for scalability and performance reasons.
All other NFS mount programs therefore require 'noac' to be explicitly
set by the user. I see no reason to punish those users with extra printk
spam.
