Heh, right, there's an aspect I hadn't really considered.
I'm not expecting top priority, not at all. This is nowhere near being 
anything important, just something that should happen eventually - so I 
thought, why not just deprecate it now and let it be cleaned up over time 
(and I'll do my share, don't worry :)
Accept the patch if you think it makes sense, drop it if you think it does 
not (or should wait).
