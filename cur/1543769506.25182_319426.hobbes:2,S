Well I imagine it could work, but again it's just a special case for
the automounter stuff.
It still won't solve the recursive mount problem that this discussion
(and your discovery of the race) originated from.
My second patch solves the problem generally (though I'm sure that
it's full of bugs yet), by keeping a reference to the namespace from
each vfsmount in that namespace.  That way, until the vfsmount remains
in the namespace (i.e. until it's unmounted) mnt_namespace can be
safely used for whatever reason (recursive bind, atomount, etc).
So why does it make sense to solve this problem only for the
automounter?
