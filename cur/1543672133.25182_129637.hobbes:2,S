Well, what if this hangs?  Unless the user specifies
"--wait" to 2.5.x's rmmod, the user absolutely does not
expect this behavior.
Rather, so that the "--wait" is respected, something one level
up ought to be doing try_module_get().
If you want to change the behavior, that's definitely to be considered,
but on a global scale not locally for sunrpc.
