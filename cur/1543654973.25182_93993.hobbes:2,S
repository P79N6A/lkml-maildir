Restarting has other problems too, namely how to save off the partial 
results.

The problem I see with this is that the signal handler can do a 
"siglongjump()" out of the regular path, and the next system call may well 
be a _new_ nanosleep() that has nothing to do with the old one. And 
realizing that it's _not_ a restarted one is interesting.
A better and more flexible approach would be to not restart the same
system call with the same parameters, but having some way of telling
do_signal to restart with new parameters and a new system call number.
For example, it shouldn't be impossible to have an interface more akin to
	...
	thread_info->restart_block.syscall = __NR_nanosleep_restart;
	thread_info->restart_block.arg0 = timeout + jiffies; /* absolute time */
	return -ERESTARTSYS_RESTARTBLOCK;
where the signal stack stuff re-writes not just eip (like the current 
restart logic does), but also rewrites the system call number and the 
argument registers.
This way you can get a truly restartable system call, because the
arguments really need to be fundamentally changed (the restarted system
call had better have _absolute_ time, not relative time, since we don't
know how much time passed before it got restarted).
