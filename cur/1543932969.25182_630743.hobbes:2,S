I still don't like it.  How about being a little more explicit:
	A ktype controls certain operations for structures with 
	embedded kobjects.  For example, if struct foo contains an 
	embedded kobject member then there should be a foo_ktype object 
	with pointers to the methods for struct foo's.  These methods
	control what happens when the kobject embedded in a struct foo
	is added or destroyed.  Every time a new struct foo is created, 
	&foo_ktype would be passed as the ktype argument in the 
	kobject_init() call for the structure's embedded kobject.  
	Each type of structure (not just foo!) with an embedded kobject 
	needs to have its own corresponding ktype object.
