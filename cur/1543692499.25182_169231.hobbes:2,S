No, it's not.
ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E) §6.4.4.1, page 55f:
5 The type of an integer constant is the first of the corresponding list
in which its value can be represented.
Suffix		Decimal Constant	Octal or Hexadecimal
					Constant
none		int			int
		long int 		unsigned int
		long long int		long int
					unsigned long int
					long long int
					unsigned long long int
... so 0x7fffffff is signed int, but 0xffffffff is unsigned int on an
I32-model system (all Linux systems are I32-model.)
