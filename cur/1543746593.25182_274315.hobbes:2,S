I can split them a little, but most of these suspend2 specific includes
are used by multiple files. Ranges, for example, are used everywhere.

I can see that it might look that way, but it's actually fundamental to
the support for building as modules (which is required for LVM &
encryption), and has been really helpful in creating clear distinctions
between the different parts of suspend. It also provides a clear method
for someone to add support for their new wizz-bang storage method or
compressor.
