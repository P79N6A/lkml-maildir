Hi,
   I've rebuilt the latest kernel 2.5.52 and test the USB 2.0 funciton with
my
   LaCie USB2.0/1394-Disk Drive 10GB and a Plextor PX-W2410TU USB2.0 CD-RW.
   It spneds about 8 minutes to copying a 300MB file. (10 times test)
   Do I miss some modules?
   Some problems I met as follows.
   (1)Sometimes it can copy completely in 30 seconds.
       Is the echi-hcd module instable or immature now?
       Or the VIA USB 2.0 host controller is bad support?
   (2) If two USB2.0 devices (HDD and CD-RW) are pluged into the same usb
hub,
       Two situations I met as follow. ( check /proc/scsi/scsi )
        A. 2 devices are found and can be attached.
        B. 2 devices are found but only one device can be attached.
   (3) What is this file, /proc/scsi/device_info, for?
   My configuration, KT333+VT8235+ IBM ATA66 10GB HDD.
   Thanks in advance.
Best Regards.
             Joseph
