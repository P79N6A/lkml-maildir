Hmm, no, I really disagree with you on this issue, Andrea. Let me change
the scenario slightly so that it becomes clear why I believe this is
unacceptable. 
First of all, when I make a filesystem on a block device I don't modify
every single block of that device so it is perfectly possible to create a
64M ext2 filesystem on a ramdisk on a 48M physical RAM machine.
Now, the root mounts it somewhere and creates a subdirectory to which a
non-privileged user can write so a non-privileged user starts creating
files in it and easily causes out of memory bringing the box down, fscking
all filesystems etc etc.
I hope you are not going to tell me "then use quotas on all ramdisk-based
filesystems", are you?
I still have not learnt enough of buffer cache internals to figure out the
way to solve this but if you (as someone who understands it better than
me) believe that the current framework of Linux Buffer Cache makes it
impossible then I believe we have a serious problem. And if so I will go
back to (now I understand a silly) idea of having vmalloc'd ramdisk, i.e.
until I understand how to solve this properly.
Does Linus think it is acceptable? Am I missing something fundamental
here? It clearly seems unacceptable to me, so I must be missing something
obvious :)
Regards,
Tigran.
