Excuse me, but did I miss a major left turn in the operations of a 
disk control system here someplace?
Every disk system I have ever delt with, has as a default, (and I've 
walked around in a couple of them at the assembly language level) the 
assumption that if track 0 is to be formatted, then the whole device 
is assumed to be needing formatted, and every filesystem I've ever 
screwed with will do exactly that.  Often, but not always, that can 
actually be offloaded to the device itself if its smart enough, and 
the operating system itself can go on about its business, whether its 
you composing a letter to your aunt Tilly or whatever.
IDE/ATAPI drives have been cheerfully ignoreing format messages from 
the OS now for what, 12 years now unless backed up by super secret 
code word access to such builtin functions of the drive, only 
possessed by the factory technicians who do have the tools to control 
the track spaceings and data densities on the surfaces etc etc?
Scsi drives have been reporting the success of the formatting 
operation in just a few milliseconds for even longer simply because 
they take care of their own errors long before the os is aware the 
drive may be having problems?  The last time I formatted a scsi drive 
under nitros9, the format took 10 milliseconds, but the logical 
installation of the filesystem took another 3 hours, mainly because 
nitros9 uses a 256 byte sector.
Its possible the cd-rw folks seem to have fallen off the wagon here, 
but really, a disk operating system (and the average cd-rw or dvd-rw 
drive should be capable of doing that with no further intervention 
from the OS itself unless you want some sort of a non-standard 
formatting done as in the nitros0 situation.
Are the firmwares of modern cd/dvd writers actualy dumb enough they 
need the OS's help for that?  If the answer is yes, lord help us.
