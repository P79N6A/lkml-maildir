I wouldn't have thought it becomes clean by dropping it ;) Is this a
trick question? My answer is that we clean a page by by taking some
action such that the underlying data matches the data in RAM...
We don't "drop" any data until it has been cleaned (again, ignoring
things like truncate for a minute). That's a bug! And
try_to_free_buffers() is called from places outside the writeout path.
This is our bug (or at least, one of our bugs that appears to have the
same triggers and symptoms as people are reporting).

Exactly. And that is exactly what try_to_free_buffers is doing now.
I still think you should have a look at the patch.
