What do you mean "address the benefits"? What I want
to address is the page reclaim problems.

You should read what I wrote.
Anyway, the fact of the matter is that there are still
fairly significant problems with page reclaim in this
workload which I would like to see fixed.
I personally still think some of the low hanging fruit
*might* be better fixed before swap prefetch gets
merged, but I've repeatedly said I'm sick of getting
dragged back into the whole debate so I'm happy with
whatever Andrew decides to do with it.
I think it is sad to turn it off for laptops, if it
really makes the "desktop" experience so much better.
Surely for _most_ workloads we should be able to
manage 1-2GB of RAM reasonably well.

Yeah. However, merging patches (especially when
changing heuristics, especially in page reclaim) is
not about just thinking up a use-case that it works
well for and telling people that they're putting their
heads in the sand if they say anything against it.
Read this thread and you'll find other examples of
patches that have been around for as long or longer
and also have some good use-cases and also have not
been merged.
