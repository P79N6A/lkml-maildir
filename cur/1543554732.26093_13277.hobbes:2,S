You can link in an initrd using linker magic, i.e.
    $(OBJCOPY) --add-section=image=kernel --add-section=initrd=initrd.gz
This is done in ppc/boot/Makefile for example.  It might be a nice thing
to add a .config option to optionally specify an initrd to link into
the kernel image.  Similarly, several architectures have a CONFIG_CMDLINE
which could also do the job (see arch/ppc/config.in for example).  
Presumably, by doing such things you could avoid needing to use mkelfImage.
