I think what happened is (the patch attached to the "removed from -mm"
mail looks like this):
  - patch-v2 merged into -mm
  - patch-v1 merged into -mm as part of xen series
  - merge conflict, the bits which are in patch-v1 got removed
    from patch-v2 to solve that, both patches in -mm
  - patch-v1 got removed with other xen bits due to the conflict
    with zachs patches.
  - mm kernel has an incomplete patch-v2 now => boom.
So it isn't a problem with the original patch, it just got corrupted
during conflict resolving.
cheers,
  Gerd
