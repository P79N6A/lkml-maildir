I've now pushed out an alternative fix for this, which imho is much 
cleaner.
We've long had infrastructure for "alternative asm instructions" that are 
conditional on CPU features, and I just made restore_fpu() use that 
instead:
	/*
	 * The "nop" is needed to make the instructions the same
	 * length.
	 */
	#define restore_fpu(tsk)                        \
	        alternative_input(                      \
	                "nop ; frstor %1",              \
	                "fxrstor %1",                   \
	                X86_FEATURE_FXSR,               \
	                "m" ((tsk)->thread.i387.fsave))
which not only makes it inline, but makes it a single instruction instead 
of the mess it was before.
Now, we should do the same for "fnsave ; fwait" vs "fxsave ; fnclex" too,
but I was lazy. If somebody wants to try that, it would need an 
"alternative_output()" define but should otherwise be trivial too.
