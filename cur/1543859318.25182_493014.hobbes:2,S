Ok. I was looking at that, and I wondered..
However, if that works, then I _think_ the correct sequence is the 
following..
The rule should be:
 - we flush the tlb _after_ we have cleared it, but _before_ we insert the 
   new entry.
But I dunno. These things are damn subtle. Does this patch fix it for you?
I actually suspect we should do this as an arch-specific macro, and 
totally replace the current "ptep_clear_flush_dirty()" with one that does 
"ptep_clear_flush_dirty_and_set_wp()".
Because what I'd _really_ prefer to do on x86 (and probably on most other 
sane architectures) is to do
 - atomically replace the pte with the EXACT SAME ONE, but one that 
   has the writable bit clear.
	bit_clear(_PAGE_BIT_RW, &(ptep)->pte_low);
 - flush the TLB, making sure that all CPU's will no longer write to it:
	flush_tlb_page(vma, address);
 - finally, just fetch-and-clear the dirty bit (and since it's no longer 
   writable, nobody should be settign it any more)
	ret = bit_clear(__PAGE_BIT_DIRTY, &(ptep)->pte_low);
and now we should be all done.
But the "ptep_get_and_clear() + flush_tlb_page()" sequence should 
hopefully also work.
Pls test.
