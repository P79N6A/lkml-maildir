That would work for filesystems but we would also need some solution
for device inodes.  (And at that point, yes, we could move it into
device-specific union, but as I've already noted, that doesn't buy us
anything currently.)
It's worth thinking about, but for that amount of effort it might be
have better ROI to work on moving the address space out of the inode
given that many/most inodes in memory are caching stat information,
not pages.
