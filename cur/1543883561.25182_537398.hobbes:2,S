But unknown-to-bugzilla email addresses are accepted when they're sent to
bugme-daemon@kernel-bugs.osdl.org.  This is why I'll very often switch a
bug report to email, copying individuals and mailing lists and
bugme-daemon.  Then bugzilla just sits silently in the background recording
everything.
But once a bug has switched to email, it needs to stay there - it would be
bad if someone were to update the bug via the web UI because none of the
emailed participants would know of the update.  So i'll often explicitly
ask "please follow up via emailed reply-to-all".
It's not great, but there's certainly enough material here for people to get
in and work on the bug, should they be so inclined.
My overall approach with this stuff is: short-term bugs are handled via email
and long-term ones are tracked in buzilla.
Hence someone (Hi, Mom) needs to track all the emailed-only bug reports and get
them filed in bugzilla once they go stale.
