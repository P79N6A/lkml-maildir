Hi,
I noticed a problem in the split MTRR code that is special casing
ARR #3 on Cyrix 6x86(MX) / MII CPUs. I wrote the code for the
original (monolithic) mtrr.c, but I don't have my old Cyrix 6x86MX
mainboard anymore. The problem is obvious though, one liner fix is
attached.  Patrick Mochel should have been more careful. :-)
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
