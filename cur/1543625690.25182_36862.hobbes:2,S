I'm working with the gaim development team, and we've run across something
really odd.  When I run gaim as root, it is able to catch SIGCHLD, but
when I run as a normal user, it is not. I've tried the 2.2.20 kernel I've
compiled myself, and also a stock 2.2.20 kernel downloaded with apt-get,
both on an intell pII running debian woody.
another user is expiriencing the same thing with a stock 2.4.19-pre4 on a
2xPIII 850
any ideas what could be causing this?
thanks,
Luke
