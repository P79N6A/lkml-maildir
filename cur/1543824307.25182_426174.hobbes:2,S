I have never disagreed that all NMIs will end up on the NMI vector (2).
But there still has to be code in arch/*/kernel to detect that the IPI
being sent is to be marked as NMI, IOW you still need the code that
sets APIC_DM_NMI.  Whether that is done by using a special vector
number (i386 does) or by defining a separate routine for sending NMI
(x86_64 does) is a matter for debate.
Unfortunately the way that you changed the x86_64 kdb code, it now does
neither.  Your hack to kdb sends an IPI using NMI_VECTOR (2) which is
(a) not actually sent as an NMI and
(b) on most of the hardware I have tested, it does not even get through
    to the other cpus, instead it generates APIC errors.
FWIW, kdb on ia64 first sends a normal maskable IPI using its own
KDB_VECTOR and waits for the other cpus to rendezvous.  Only if some
cpus have not rendezvoused does ia64 kdb resort to using a non-maskable
interrupt.  I have found that this gives much better backtracing and is
more reliable.  It is a sad fact of life that NMIs can be delivered in
the middle of code that sets up the kernel stack, when that happens it
is impossible to backtrace.  I am changing kdb on i386 to do the same
two step process, try a normal interrupt first, wait a bit then resort
to NMI.
