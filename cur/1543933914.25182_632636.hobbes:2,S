Hmm, I think they can be reordered without any problem.  It's always the same
kernel using them, although at different times.

Well, I'll add a coment next to the definition of struct saved_context to
explain what it's for, but IMO the behavior of __save_processor_state() is what
_really_ matters (ie. it doesn't matter how and where exactly it saves the
registers as long as __restore_processor_state() can restore their "old"
values).
