Hi all,
I just installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update
4) on a Dell PE1950 server, which has two of dual-core Xeon 5110
1.6GHz CPUs. According to the processor spec @
http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL9RZ
 , it doesn't
support Hyper-threading technology, but both 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep
' and 'dmidecode | grep -A 30 Flags' commands show there're "ht" or
"HTT (Hyper-threading technology)" available.
I think it should be kernel level's problem, is there anyone to
explain it please?
Thank you.
Liang Feng
