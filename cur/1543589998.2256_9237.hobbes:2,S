I think it has to mean a hardware problem.

That patch is only used when the prefetchw faults with an illegal instruction
and is done so you can boot an athlon kernel on a lesser cpu
The prefetch instructions hint to the CPU what memory we will access very soon.
The primary effect of that is that we hit full theoretical memory bandwidth
when copying pages. It doesnt really change execution behaviour in any other
way which then does rather point to cpu or other hardware problem. The very
early athlons had prefetch bugs but we would not trigger those and no reporters
have such an early CPU.
What still stands out is that exactly _zero_ people have reported the same
problem with non VIA chipset Athlons.
