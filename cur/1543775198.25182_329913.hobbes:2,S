I'm desperate, please help, if I'm missing something obvious.
I am trying to add a function to the file drivers/char/keyboard.c
and then be able to call this function from my kernel module
adding the function to keyboard.c, recompiling and booting with kernel
results  /proc/kallsyms telling me that my function exists with the tag 'T',
which I think is ok
In my module I simply declare the function's prototype and use it.
When trying to compile the module, modpost tells that the function's symbol
is not found. (insmodding results in error too)
I don't get it, WHY tha heck can it find all the other stuff and 
what makes this new function different? I have read that 2.6 kernel exports
any non-static symbols.
Regards!
