I mean #DEF_TIMESLICE seems like an initial quota, which gets reset with each 
major rotation.  Increasing this according to nice may give it more room for 
an interactivity boost, before being expired.  Alternatively, you may just 
reset the rotation, if the task didn't use it's quota within one full major 
rotation, effectively skipping the expiry toll.

The thing is, latencies are currently dependent on the number of tasks in the 
run-queue; i.e. more rq-tasks means higher latencies, yet fixed timeslices 
according to nice.  Just switching this the other way around, by fixing 
latencies according to nice, and adjusting the timeslices depending on 
rq-load, may yield a much more scalable system.
Thanks!
