I agree not at all. I do not care whether the EFI creators smoked the
Windows-crackpipe or some other hallucinogen when they decided to use
this calling convention. We definitely do not want to think about
NDISwrapper or any other Windows related hackery in the kernel.
I still do not understand why we need all this EFI hackery at all
aside of the possible usage for saving a crash dump on FLASH, which we
could do directly from the kernel as well.
