Martin,
There are several 'issues' with the ide-cd changes, in fact I think they
are horrible. I'll take part of the blame for that, I'll explain.
The ata_ar_get() doesn't belong inside the do_request() strategies, the
reason I did that for ide-disk was to get going on the tcq stuff and not
spend too much time rewriting the ide request handling at that point. It
was _never_ meant to propagate into the other ide drivers, and in fact
the code in ide-disk has several tcq specific parts that really cannot
work in ide-cd. Such as (ide-cd.c:ide_cdrom_do_request()):
	spin_lock...
	ar = ata_ar_get()
	if (!ar) {
		spin_unlock;
		return ide_started;
	}
	...
ide-disk guarentees that if ata_ar_get() fails, it's because we have
some pending commands on the drive. The ide_started is bogus too, in
this context it really should be ide_didnt_start_jack, but it works for
ide-disk because of the above assumptions.
Don't tell me you can read ide_cdrom_do_request() right now without a
barf bag :-)
I'd suggest moving the ata_ar_get() at the ide_queue_commands() level,
and just pass { drive, ar } to the do_request() strategies. That's also
why ide-disk.c:idedisk_do_request() has this comment:
	/*
	 * get a new command (push ar further down to avoid grabbing
	 * lock here
	 */
	spin_lock_irqsave(DRIVE_LOCK(drive), flags);
	ar = ata_ar_get(drive);
	...
I've been meaning to do this once tcq settled down, just didn't get
around to it yet. But please don't start moving stuff like this into
ide-cd too.
