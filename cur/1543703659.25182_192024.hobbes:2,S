It might be buggy code on my part, but it looks pretty solid to me.   
I'd be happy to show anyone interested.
My load ought to find such a merge, if they happen with any freqency at 
all.  Compiling two kernels
at the same time and "general running" are my two current loads.  The 
disk queue gets to over 70
entries, which is rather high for a personal workstation, and I'm 
searching tens of thousands to accesses
in total.
Does anyone know that this code is actualy useful?  Has anyone ever seen 
it actually do a merge of consecutive
data accesses for requests that were not issued themselves consequtively?
