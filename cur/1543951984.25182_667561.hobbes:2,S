Ahhh... Okay those slabs did not change for 2.6.25-rc. Is there
really a difference to 2.6.24?

Yes but that is to be expected given that hackbench does allocate objects 
and then passes them to other processors for freeing.
Could you get me more details on the two critical slabs?
Do slabinfo -a and then pick one alias for each of those sizes.
Then do
slabinfo skbuff_head (whatever alias you want to use to refer to the slab)
for each of them. Should give some more insight as to how slub behaves
with these two slab caches.
