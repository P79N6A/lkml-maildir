I am fairly certain we are still paying the penalty for letting the
mathematicians have the first crack at computing back in the pre-history.
"Domain of the problem yields a range of solutions" and all its variations
makes "domain" from the "wonderful world of set theory" come creeping up in
all of its forms.
I myself am guilty of talking about the "domain of a problem" and I reek at
math... 8-)
