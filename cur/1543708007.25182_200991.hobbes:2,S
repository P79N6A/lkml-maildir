In struct snd_emu10k1_memblk in include/sound/emu10k1.h first_page and 
last_page are defined as short.
Loading a soundfont that goes beyond 32767 pages causes an oops because 
{first|last}_page go negative in snd_emu10k1_sample_new 
(sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1_patch.c) as sfxload loads the font.
Changing {first|last}_page to int allows the soundfont to load and it 
appears to work fine.
