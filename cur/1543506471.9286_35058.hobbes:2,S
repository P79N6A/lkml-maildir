Are you implying that it would suffice if you could use MAP_SHARED of
/dev/zero and/or MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS style shared memory?
If so, there is (or was) a patch for doing this for Linux (look for
shmfs). It seems to me like a nice feature for 2.3
See
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9806.2/0803.html
(It was even designed explicitly for shm_open)
Unfortunately the website seems to have disappeared :-(
