No, gpm is not obsoleted. The kernel driver is supposed to export
enough data in the /dev/input/eventX interface. It's then up to user
space programs such as gpm or the XFree driver to do something useful
with this data.
One bonus is that the eventX device can be opened by multiple readers,
so conflicts between gpm and the X driver should not happen any more.
No nead to create any additional shared buffers.
Note that I didn't design this event infrastructure. I just started to
work on the synaptics kernel driver when I realized the XFree driver
didn't work with the 2.5.x kernel.

What does dmesg say?

You should now use /dev/input/eventX, for some X. The XFree driver has
code to autodetect the correct X which you can probably reuse for gpm.
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
From the event device, you read data looking like this:
        struct input_event {
        	struct timeval time;
        	__u16 type;
        	__u16 code;
        	__s32 value;
        };
The synaptics kernel driver currently reports the following events:
        ABS_X
        ABS_Y
                X, Y coordinates for the finger.
        ABS_PRESSURE
                Z value
        MSC_GESTURE
                W value (emulated if the touchpad doesn't support w)
        BTN_LEFT
        BTN_RIGHT
                Left/right buttons
        BTN_FORWARD
        BTN_BACK
                Up/down buttons, if present.
        BTN_0, ..., BTN_7
                Multi buttons, if present.
Note that the kernel driver only reports changes, so you can no longer
rely on the fact that the touchpad keeps sending data 1s after you
stop using it.
Pass through port devices (pointing sticks for example) get their own
eventX device (at least with the extra kernel patches from the web
page above), but they also report to the /dev/input/mice device, so I
think they will just work without extra gpm support. (I don't have the
hardware to test this though.)
If this data is insufficient for the gpm driver, now would be a good
time to extend/change it, before the stuff gets too widely used. Some
points that have been raised before:
* The W value ought to be split in "number of fingers" and "finger
  width". That would make the protocol general enough to be used for
  other touchpad models too, such as ALPS.
* The Y value is reported in raw form. Should probably be mirrored
  depending on how the touchpad is oriented.
I have also attached a simple test program I created to read from the
event device. Maybe you find it useful for some initial tests.
