this possibility.

	Using of /dev/ppp for this purposes need some support from the
pppd side. With my method (send SIGHUP to pppd) we need not to change
pppd at all. And I suppouse that there is no needings to make difficult
the job, that can be done in a simplier way. Also my patch fix this
problems not only in PPP but in SLIP driver too, where we have not /dev/slip.
