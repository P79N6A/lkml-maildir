You also realize, I hope, that obfuscating this for the compiler just
hurts.  As has already been described, there are versions involving
jumps, selects, multiplication, tables, ffs, and popcount.  All of those
operations are hideously expensive on some architectures and cheap on
others.
Personally, I would bet that the version as originally written is
probably best, since select (conditional move) is a fairly commonly
supported operation, especially on architectures where jumps are expensive.
Just to confuse the situation further, here is yet another version:
bool is_power_of_2(unsigned long n)
{
	return !!n & !(n & (n-1));
}
... which, on i686 compiles to:
00000000 <is_power_of_2>:
   0:   85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
   2:   8d 50 ff                lea    0xffffffff(%eax),%edx
   5:   0f 95 c1                setne  %cl
   8:   85 d0                   test   %edx,%eax
   a:   0f 94 c0                sete   %al
   d:   0f b6 c0                movzbl %al,%eax
  10:   21 c8                   and    %ecx,%eax
  12:   c3                      ret
In the current version, gcc does generate a jump on i686 and x86-64:
00000000 <is_power_of_2>:
   0:   89 c2                   mov    %eax,%edx
   2:   31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax
   4:   85 d2                   test   %edx,%edx
   6:   74 0b                   je     13 <is_power_of_2+0x13>
   8:   8d 42 ff                lea    0xffffffff(%edx),%eax
   b:   85 c2                   test   %eax,%edx
   d:   0f 94 c0                sete   %al
  10:   83 e0 01                and    $0x1,%eax
  13:   f3 c3                   repz ret
