That question has nothing to do with fixing the bug in
the /proc/acpi/alarm code.  The bug is still there whether
I personally use a different mechanism or not!  :)
But in answer to your question, the new RTC drivers *also* fail
for some other reason.  They did work up until the HPET integration
(back in 2.6.26 ?), but have not worked since.
My MythTV box always tries the new ones, and if the readback test
fails to agree with what was attempted, it then falls back to
the old yet more reliable /proc/acpi/alarm.
I haven't really had time to find the exact breakage point and patch it
in the new RTC code yet (I put about 10 hours into it back then,
with no useful result), but the old code does have a useful fix.
Thus this thread.
Cheers
