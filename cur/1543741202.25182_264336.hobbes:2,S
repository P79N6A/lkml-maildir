Yes.
You probably need to upgrade your binutil package. The .bss LMA start address
section is not dealt the way it should by ld.
An other (bad) way to work around this compile problem is to force the .bss LMA
start address with the following OBJCOPYFLAGS at objcopy time.
OBJCOPYFLAGS := -O binary --change-section-lma .bss-0xc0000000 -R .note -R
.comment -S
Hope this help,
Remi
