Hello,
    Thanks for your mail. Can you let me know what are the other protocols that performs better than PPP ?
Thanks

You can do this with a user space helper if performance isnt critical
(ie its not megabits). Create a tty/pty pair. Plug pppd one side of it
and run your own program the other side between it and the real tty.
This is how the old scarabd radio driver worked, although not using PPP
because we found that with the losses we got on radio other protocols
worked better.
