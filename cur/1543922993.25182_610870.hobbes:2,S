Well, I explained it rather succinctly, I think. If you tell me whats unclear

It doesn't. It removes it from the epoll set, though, so the parent will not
receive events for that fd anymore.

This is because epoll doesn't behave like documented: It removes the fd
from the parents epoll set only on an explicit close() syscall, not on an
implicit close from exec.

Yes. But thats obviously not the only way to close fds.

You already said you don't the problem. No need to get insulting :(

Well, it behaves like documented, which is the problem. You admit you
don't understand the problem or the documentation, so again, no need to
insult me.

   // assume there is an open epoll set that listens for events on fd 5
   if (fork () = 0)
     {
       close (5);
       // fd 5 is now removed from the epoll set of the parent.
       _exit (0);
     }
