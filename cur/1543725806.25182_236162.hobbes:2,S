Wow, that was low. Does your doctor even let you go outside with such
a thin skin? I did not say most things you are attacking me for, and I
could easily defend the points I did make. But I don't care for wasting
my time in flame wars, and while I didn't see one before, there is one
now. It's your pet project, the stage is all yours, have fun.
