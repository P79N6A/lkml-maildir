That commercial perspective is then completely misguided.
All alternatives I have seen to UML (plex, vmware, UMLinux) suck IMHO. They
are inherently much more platform specific than UML. The necessary
modifications on the host for UML ska mode are minimal and I think besides
bashing out whether it should be a syscall, proc file or whatever, everybody
seems pretty much set on integrating them into the kernel.
