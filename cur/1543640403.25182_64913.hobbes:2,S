It would be nice if I could get it into 2.6, but it's not a problem if it
has to wait. I'm currently busy getting menuconfig working again and then
I'm pretty much ready for a beta release.

by a choice statement and later redefined. My new parser can't deal with
this, because user input is given the highest priority.
