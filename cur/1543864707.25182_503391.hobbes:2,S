Actually, the thing I like about kernel micro-threads (and that "fibril" 
name is starting to grow on me) is that I'm hoping we might be able to use 
them for that kevent thing too. And perhaps some other issues (ACPI has 
some "events" that might work with synchronously scheduled threads).
IOW, synchronous threading does have its advantages..
Btw, I noticed that you didn't Cc Ingo. Definitely worth doing. Not just 
because he's basically the normal scheduler maintainer, but also because 
he's historically been involved in things like the async filename lookup 
that the in-kernel web server thing used. EXACTLY the kinds of things 
where fibrils actually give you *much* nicer interfaces.
Ingo - see linux-kernel for the announcement and WIP patches.
