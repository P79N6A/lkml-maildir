there is one case where we could 'miss' a new latency: when
/proc/latency_trace is accessed. For the duration of /proc/latency_trace
access, the updating of the max latency is stopped:
        if (down_trylock(&max_mutex))
                goto out;
this is not really a practical problem and fixing it would be quite 
complex.
