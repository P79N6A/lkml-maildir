I don't know much about the history of this bug but it's quite clear
it's deliberately inserted:
	void * kmalloc (size_t size, int flags)
		<if allocation succeeds, exit>
	        BUG(); // too big size
	        return NULL;
It says "kernel allocation will *never* fail, and if you try to kmalloc
something too large, that's a bug too" - not a reason to try again.  I'd
check with Linus before solving the problem that way ;-)
