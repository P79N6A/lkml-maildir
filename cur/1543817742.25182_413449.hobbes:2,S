Yeah dropping it on exec makes sense to me.

The aim is not to implement little endian binaries but to assist
running portions of code in little endian mode. The thought is we could
hook up qemu to it and avoid having to byteswap.
While ppc has byteswap integer loads it does not have byteswap floating
point loads and a byteswap involves loading into the integer unit,
performing the byteswap, storing to a temporary location and loading
into the floating point unit. Rather slow.
