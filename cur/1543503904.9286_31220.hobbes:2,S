PCI cards usually use busmaster DMA, and do transfers in bursts. (es1370
for example: always 32 bytes/burst. Cards with real DSPs like the TB
MultiSound "Hurricane architecture" series, are usually fully
programmable from the driver.)
If the distance between the patterns is less than the buffer size; this
will happen every now and then:
1. You read pattern n. Not overwritten.
2. DMA burst overwrites pattern n AND pattern (n + 1).
3. You read pattern (n + 1), which has now been overwritten...
Pretty much the same kind of phenomena as video tearing, or interprocess
communication sync problems.
