I too have seen this problem in pre 8 but not in pre6 or earlier.  It has
occurred with me with mirror and find running from updatedb as a cron job.
There are no usefull messages on the console or in messages.
Debugging suggestions are welcomed. I'll try to strace mirror next time I
have the chance.
