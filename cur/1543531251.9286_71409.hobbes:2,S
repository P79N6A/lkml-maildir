Subject: PDA stuff into Main Stream Kernel Devel?

I've been working on getting Linux going on my Aero 2100 (www.linux-vr.org)
(Vr41xx CPU) site
It looks like the Version of the Kernel is Based on the MIPS Stuff from
SGI.. and doesn't look
very much like the normal kernel devel stuff. Do you think guys the PDA
stuff will get into the main-stream
kernel devel stuff as I hate working on different versions of the kernel :(
Thanks
