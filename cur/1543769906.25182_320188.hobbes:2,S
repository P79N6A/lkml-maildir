Only that in th KConfig files. :-(
It's fairly simple really.  You can select a default scheduler at kernel 
build time.  If you wish to boot with a scheduler other than the default 
it can be selected at boot time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched, 
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills or zaphod.  If you don't change the 
default when you build the kernel the default scheduler will be 
ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the 
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
