Subject: OFTOPIC: C vs C++ (was Re: C++ in kernel)
I'm probably stepping into a hornet's nest but this is an interesting
question
to me so:
Would you (and anyone else who would like to make a case) say that writinng
an
opperating system in C++ is probably not a "good idea" or just that trying
to
convert the Linux kernel would definitely not be a "good idea"?
Hypothetically,  say when I get lots better at programing,  I decide I want
to
make another opperating system,  I would be fooling myself if I thought I
should use C++.
I'm really not wanting to get into a religious war because I can accept the
idea that some languages are better at some things than others.  I plan on
getting good at both C and C++ as they are both widely used and have
important
applications in the real world.
But I have heard that C is much better suited to working closely with
hardware
while C++ is great for creating layers of abstraction that can help
programmers
concentrate on the algorythms.  Of course,  I'm very new to these languages
so
>> reply
Well, "a" layer of abstraction doesn't necesarily add to bloat so it can
produce code similar to C.  And C++ can do virtually anything C can so it
can be used just as well for working with the hardware.
>> reply
most of my information is hearsay.
I would love to hear from several people about this.
