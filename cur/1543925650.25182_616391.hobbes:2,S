I'm not in either category. I want a truly stable (as in "quality", not
as in "static" as the distros use the term) base system that simply 
works, but I want to follow certain interesting software more closely.
I also doubt the average luser wants the broken software that distros
include in their megafrozen "stable" collections. Of course, most of
the software that the average luser wants is much better supported
than tested than marginal software, but they do occasionally venture
there, and get crap.
