Ok, Waugh's question clued me to the fact that once you open
a file descriptor write-only, you can't change it to readable
without closing it first, regardless of what you may do to the
filesystem inode with fchmod()/chmod().
So this is a unix bug rather than a linux bug?
Thanks for the tip,
Clayton Weaver
