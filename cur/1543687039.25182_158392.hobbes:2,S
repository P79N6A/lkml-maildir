Speaking only for me, and all that.
I use it.  It's actually pretty handy sometimes, because it lets me
peek at task structures et cetera from userspace; so when I have a
problem with the kernel accessing the wrong memory, I can go figure out
what it's actually looking at.
This is a sort of poor-man's-kgdb.  I don't think there's much need for
/proc/kcore if you have a working kgdb, which I'd still like to see
cleaned up and integrated.
