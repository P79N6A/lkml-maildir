MAX_DMA_ADDRESS was probably born to stay.  There are places where you need to
deciede if an address can be directly dma'ed to.  MAX_DMA_ADDRESS is by far
the simplest way to do this for ISA.
Good NUMA support is somewhat more hairy.  One of the things we're working
on.  If you're interested follow the work via anonymous cvs on oss.sgi.com.
