Hi
I'm not sure if it's the thing you're looking for, but 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/arsenic/
did that. I never got their code running, though,
their modified acenic firmware didn't run at all, and according
to the docs it required a rev5 board (rev4 and 6 are what people usually
have). Still, it might be possible to use their userland tcp/ip
library in other projects with some hackery.
