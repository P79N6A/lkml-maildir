Well it's certainly not good!  :-)
One of the failure modes that will cause an immediate shutdown of a USB 
host controller is a PCI error.  If the controller isn't working lots of 
bad things are likely to follow.  I can imagine that even if that doesn't 
happen, PCI errors could mess up other drivers or hardware too.
