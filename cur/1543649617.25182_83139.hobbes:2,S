Right.  This does make sense for a server with thousands of idle
connections.   You could have lots of unused memory in that case.

Right.  I can see this too.  This might be thorny for epoll though,
since it's entirely conceivable that such libraries would be expecting
level style poll semantics.

Right.  However in this case, I think using poll is a stop gap
solution.
It would be better to give accept, connect, and sendfile (and
sendfile64) native status in AIO.  Even if the implementations are not
going to be ready for a while, I think their spots in the API should
be reserved now.
That said, the first two points above convince me that there are valid
reasons why poll is also needed in AIO.
