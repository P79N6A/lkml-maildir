A 1GHz PIII will do about 8MBytes/sec of 3DES
Plug in a 2.4Gbs broadcom crypto chip into a 64bit PCI-X slot with the
same CPU and you should be capable of doing at least 10 times that.
Stuff like RSA is much slower (and benefits more from hardware)
BTW - there are some outdated cryptolib patches with an async
interface around somewhere (along with patches for freeswan to use
the async api).
I guess the crypto guys like Chris will add the async API if they need
it (which they do i think ;).
