Have you tried reading from a different card?  The common opinion seems to be that the actual data starts some way in to the card, and as you get an input/output error when you try to access the card from the begining, it could be that there is a genuine media error, that is not showing up when you use drivers from another OS, that do not attempt to read those first few blocks, because they 'know' where the filesystem begins.
Just an idea, anyway.
John.
