Problem seems to happen immediately, and just first run of cache_reap
(2 seconds after eventd initializes if I understand it correctly) already
finds problem.
But I'm confused.  I've just added code which is supposed to verify all
additions to the cache entry[] (
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/verify-all-entry-add.diff
)
on the top of Christoph patch to catch one which later causes problem in cache_reap,
and it logs nothing at the time crash was happening :-(  Only incident it logs is
"while (batchcount > 0)" loop in cache_alloc_refill, saying that
objp ffff81007ffd9430 belonging to the slab ffff81007ffd9000 which belongs
    to node 1 was added to array_cache belonging to node 0 (called from
    ffffffff8016e4a9)  (mm/slab.c ~ line 2430)
... cache avc_node
This repeats couple of times, for avc_node, mnt_cache, proc_inode_cache
and bdev_cache.  Nothing else.
So I've reverted your fix, and still I did not catch offender, so I'm probably
missing some place which populates array_cache entry[] :-(
Only if after I added logging to free_block() I was able to find that offender is
proc_inode_cache.  But I have no idea how this object appeared in the incorrect
node cache...
