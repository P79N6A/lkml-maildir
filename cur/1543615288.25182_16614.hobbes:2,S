Yeah, that's my point.  Saying "just make it suid" is not a good answer, 
because it ignores the fact that smart sysdamins don't want to run suid
programs more than absolutely necessary.  Not to mention screwing people
who follow Linus's good advice and configure/build kernels as non-root.

But this is not a bad reason.  Allowing people to avoid running suid 
programs is a *good* reason.
