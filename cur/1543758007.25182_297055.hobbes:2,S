Do you have a pointer to your user space kdump stuff?  I have never
seen it.
How to configure this and the usability issues are interesting.  There is
no fundamental reason the code needs to live in a ramdisk.  We are back
in a fully functional kernel after all.  In this case a
ramdisk/initramfs is useful for the same reason a ramdisk with a 
rescue disk is useful.  It is possible the normal root filesystem is
corrupt.   A ramdisk allows you to have a known good copy of your
tools.
