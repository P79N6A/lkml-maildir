I looked at the reiser4 patch, and it does very little outside of the 
fs/reiser4 directory. If it is no longer supported by namesys, why can't 
it just be removed from the kernel like all the other bits that are 
obsoleted?
I am just saddened that kernel decisions are motivated by politics and a 
personal dislike of Hans Reiser rather than technical merit. :(

I am not arguing for the inclusion of reiser4 in the kernel, but you 
should know it has its uses. There are very many things that reiser4 can 
do that will make ext3 blow up. It simply the best filesystem for many 
kinds of usage patterns.
