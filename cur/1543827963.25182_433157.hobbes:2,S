Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2.6.17-rc6] input/mouse/sermouse: fix memleak and potential buffer overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While strolling trough the sermouse driver for some example code, I
noticed 2 strange things happening there :
* In the sermouse_connect function an input device structure is
  allocated (input_allocate_device), which is not deallocated 
  in the sermouse_disconnect function.  
  If I understand this correctly someone repeatedly connecting and 
  disconnecting the mouse would leak input_dev structures.
* In the sermouse_connect function the phys member of the sermouse 
  structure (32 characters) is initialised with :
     sprintf(sermouse->phys, "%s/input0", serio->phys);
  Because serio->phys is also a 32 character field the sprintf could
  result in 39 characters being written to the sermouse->phys.
If my understanding of both these concepts is correct, this is a patch
to fix the problems.
