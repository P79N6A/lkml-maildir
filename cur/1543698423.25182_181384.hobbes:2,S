I'd need to find and evaluate your 4.1.0-beta works first. Oops, I've
got it, I should look into
http://www.de.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/v4/
 :-)
Being used to a different directory layout, I looked into the testing
directories and didn't notice there was an actual 4.0.0 version. Wee.

User-space issues should not be discussed on linux-kernel in the first
place. If the user-space daemon just disables those features it doesn't
find kernel support for, no-one has any ground to base a complaint on.
For my purposes, I don't *really* need browsable top-level directories
(for /net or /host style mounts), I'm used to giving the name explicitly
to trigger the mount, and if that works RELIABLY (i. e. picking up old
mounts after coming back after a daemon dcrash), that's most I need on
short notice :-)
I cannot make a qualified statement yet as the most current version I've
in production is 4.0.0pre10, and that's pretty aged. I'll review the
4.0.0 and 4.1.0-beta3 versions later and see if they rid me of some
"stale NFS file handle" that keep haunting my LAN.
Either way, your work is much welcome and appreciated. Before even
looking at the results, thank you for the effort put into this software.
I'll come back to you later with my findings - might be "week-end"
though.
Best regards,
Matthias
