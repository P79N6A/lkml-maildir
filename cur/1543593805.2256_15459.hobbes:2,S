Then whatever sets up your ServerWorks ServerSet III LE chipset
needs its PCI IRQ setup fixed ... I'm not sure how to do this.
Perhaps someone who's familiar with arch/i386/kernel/pci-*.c
irq setup can suggest the right patch for this problem.  I think
the "dmesg" output in your original post probably had the info
needed to figure that out.
