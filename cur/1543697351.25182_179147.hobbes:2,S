Russell King looked at this about a year ago and found no specific flaw with
moving the parport_serial.c file from drivers/parport/ to drivers/char to
solve the ordering issue:

I think it should go into 2.4. It fixes this particular ordering issue
without mucking about with the ordering mechanism or even adding code. I'm
sorry to say that I had forgotten about it. It's a good minimum-change
brute-force umm... solution. No bloat or complexity issues. 
At your convenience, please move the parport_serial.c file and apply the
corresponding Makefile changes. 
cheers,
