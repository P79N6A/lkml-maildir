Hey, what are you talking about ?
Everybody should shut up, until some people have decided that others can
participate in the development ?
I proposed this to stop this stupid race for the better solution, which
is ugly and horrid, as you accept yourself.
There is no rush to push those enhancements within no time and there is
no Nobel prize to win.
Both groups have published their incomplete solutions and now we should
stop and contemplate how to merge this effort in a less nerve racking
way so we can improve and investigate this further on a common base.
