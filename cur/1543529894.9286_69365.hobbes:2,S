This is _very_ nontrivial. Think about open TCP connections, open files and
such. When you resurrect the process (perhaps even on a different
machine?!), the TCP connections are long gone, and the files might have
dissapeared or have changed under your buffers.
Again, it is simply not worth it to include hair into the kernel for
handling very extreme situations, as OOM certainly is.
