hi All
1) I like to ask why patch support is not provided for
2.6.11 kernel....
2) What needs to be done in order to use 2.6.11 kernel
with full AIO Support
3) Is it possible to apply 2.6.13-rc6-B0-all.diff
patch provided by ben to2.6.11 kernel after some
modification,and if that is done whether i be able to
get full kernel AIO Support
4) if i applied suparna's patches with
linux-2.6.12-PAIO-0.6.tar on linux-2.6.12-rc6 kernel,I
am getting Some errors with respect to suparna's
patches.Thay are not getting applied cleanly... 
So i am trying to manually applied them ...but will i
be able to Full AIO Support after
applying those patches on linux-2.6.12-rc6 .
