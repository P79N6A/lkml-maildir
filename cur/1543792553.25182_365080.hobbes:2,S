Right.  My point is only that it's not clear from looking at the call
site whether a struct passed by reference will be modified by the
callee (some people pass by reference just for "efficiency").  And if
the called function modifies the data without the caller's knowledge,
it leads to obscure bugs.  Whereas if you pass a pointer, it's
immediately clear that the called function can modify the pointed-to
object.
