I'm also seeing this with test6-pre5 on one particular box. It happens at
boot time, shortly after bringing up the network interfaces.  100%
repeatable. 
Init seems to be claiming that fork() returns EAGAIN, but some printk()'s in
sys_fork() indicate  that fork() is _not_ failing.  Needs more debugging.
