Where? Calling buffer_IO_error would be ok, but there are no such calls
in 2.4.3. I just stated elsewhere that submit_bh should probably be
clearing the dirty bit, not ll_rw_block, in which case the b_end_io
is fine. But buffer_IO_error is probably more clear. I trust you'll
take care of that part then.
