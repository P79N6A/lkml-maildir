Hi,
For ARM, I require pgd_alloc to take a struct mm_struct argument (so the
pgd_alloc prototype becomes "pgd_t *pgd_alloc(struct mm_struct *)".
Why?  Because ARM must always have the first virtual page allocated and
present - its used for the hardware vectors, and in order to allocate
the page table for this page, I need a mm_struct (see the pte_alloc
prototype and associated code in mm/memory.c).
There are various options here:
1. Either I can fix up all architectures, and send a patch to this list, or
2. You can fix it up, send me a patch, and I'll collate them and send the
   whole to Linus.
3. I can send a patch to Alan, and you can send your individual patches again
   to Alan, and Alan can send the whole patch to Linus.
Its up to you how this is done.
