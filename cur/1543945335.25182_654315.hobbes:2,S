So that would mean that mlock is used by the application before it 
registers memory for direct access, and then it is up to the RDMA
layer and the OS to negotiate actual pinning of the addresses for
whatever duration is required.
There is no *protocol* barrier to replacing pages within a Memory
Region as long as it is done in a way that keeps the content of
those page coherent. But existing devices have their own ideas
on how this is done and existing devices are notoriously poor at
learning new tricks.
Merely mlocking pages deals with the end-to-end RDMA semantics.
What still needs to be addressed is how a fastpath interface
would dynamically pin and unpin. Yielding pins for short-term
suspensions (and flushing cached translations) deals with the
rest. Understanding the range of support that existing devices
could provide with software updates would be the next step if
you wanted to pursue this.
