I can see your point but I think you're a bit too extreme in your assessment on a simple console
message (with almost no processing behind it). If someone really wants to "flood" the console with messages they 
go other and possibly easier ways to achieve the same thing, how about "logger" !
But since it seems to bother you a lot, I will remove the message.
Cheers Swen
