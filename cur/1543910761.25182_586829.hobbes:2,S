Yeah, "no signoff" was one of my first reactions to that.  :)
Can you update the Documentation/spi/spi-summary text which is
invalidated by this change?  That's part of why I rejected an
earlier version of this patch:  since it broke the documentation,
it was incomplete.
The other reason was to explore removing the "struct class" too,
since it's not necessary.  But it turns out to be simpler to
keep it in there to allocate the bus IDs.  So I've changed my
mind, and will merge a patch like $SUBJECT if it's complete
(i.e. doesn't leave broken/invalid docs).
