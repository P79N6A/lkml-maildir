In symmetric cryptography you would give away your key if one could read the kernel binary
while in assymetric one can only get the public key
Protecting a TripleDES key in high security standards is not as simple as making the kernel read protected, you need a whole lot and 
that also means hardware (cryptomemories e.t.c)
So you forget about all this overhead when you use assymetric
Also this is the way this is done in all implementations ranging from Linux platforms (see DigSig@sourceforge for an example, or in 
Debian, Fedora) and in Microsoft platforms as far as i know
