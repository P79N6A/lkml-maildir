It doesn't make sense. Directory doesn't contain files. It refers to them.

	It *doesn't* emulate the predicted behaviour. Learn what hardlinks
are. Symlinks do not follow the file when it is renamed. Symlinks break
when the file is removed. Sigh... UNIX 101 time again. Files are nameless.
They don't belong to any directory. They may have *no* links (if they are
unlinked but still not closed somebody). Directories are lists of named
references to files. Such a reference is *not* a file - file can be
refered from many places or from none (see above). Symlink is a *file*. As
any file it can be refered from a lot of places. It doesn't point anywhere
- it just contains a string and is marked in a way that makes many
operations treat it in a special way if it is met in process of lookup. It
has no connection with any other object in filesystem (just as regular
files have none). Again, directories don't work as containers - they are
lists of references. Hell, nobody mistakes the library catalog for bookshelf.
Why does it become so hard with filesystems?
