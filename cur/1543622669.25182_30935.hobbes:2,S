No, it's not.  That's an issue for how the kernel maintainers (in this
case, Marcello) want to organize things.  Linus used an "old" directory,
Marcello hasn't so far.
Even if it was you should send to ftpadmin@kernel.org.
[Marcello: if you want, I can do this and also add this stuff to the
"bless-as-final" script.]
