because it matters where people spend their time. And if you count
bugreports that are actually distro support questions and then say "but
these aren't looked at" it's not fair either.

and that does happen. And half the time people just remain silent :(
I know I look at a whole bunch of bugreports in areas that I work on. I
see a lot of other people doing something similar. That doesn't mean
nothing slips through. I'm sure stuff does slip through. I would HOPE
it's really obscure things only; but I fear it's also cases where the
reporter didn't put the right people on the CC as well ;(
