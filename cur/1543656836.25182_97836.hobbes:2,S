This one is due to the way AGPGART does (or has done for the last 3
years) its module locking. It does a MOD_INC_USE_COUNT as soon as
someone calls the acquire routines. (So you can't unload agpgart
whilst you've a 3d using app (like X) open).
This seems quite sensible, but these days you can't unload agpgart.ko
anyway because the chipset module (via-agp.ko in your case) already
has it 'in use', so I'm tempted to drop those bits.

That's matrox's binary only X blob. Not my fault.

This one is. But it may be a knock-on effect from the bug above.
I'll nail that one first.

That one's a problem for the DRI folks.
