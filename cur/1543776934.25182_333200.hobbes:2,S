Hello Wendy,
Two things: your patch needs to be properly signed off on.  Read 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches for a description of what that entials.  
Secondly, your patch adds whitespace on the end of the else.  Aside 
from that, the printk should be removed -- just replace it with the 
ret = -ENOSYS.
Also, please cc linux-aio@kvack.org on future aio patches.  Cheers,
		-ben
