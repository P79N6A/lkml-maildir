Yep, you guessed it. I'm no big fan of Lindent. In my opinion, it makes some 
really bad choices about how to break long lines (among other things), as 
you've kindly pointed out. But, I had to start somewhere and wanted to get 
something out before I left for the day. Obviously the AIX plugin will need 
some additional attention at some point.
