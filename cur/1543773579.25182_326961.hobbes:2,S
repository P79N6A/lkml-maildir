I was browsing the kernel sources and I think there is a bug near the
top of the tcp_init_metrics() function (in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c).  The
lines are:
if (dst_metric_locked(dst, RTAX_CWND))
        tp->snd_cwnd_clamp = dst_metric(dst, RTAX_CWND);
I think the dst_metric() function should have been called in the first
line above, and not dst_metric_locked() -- this is how it is done in the
code lines following that one.
