Nope. Because "Linux" is not an exactly defined technical term, it is,
as most words are, defined by it's typical use.
Linux is an OS. Have you ever said "Today I have recompiled Linux" ?
Probably not, you would say "I compile a new kernel". In fact, noone
uses the plain word "Linux" to refer to the kernel.

That is beyond the typical use of the phrase "different OS's". You won't
be understood if you say "I have three different OS's in my Office". You
would say something like "I have three different flavours of Linux". But
in most cases the difference doesn't matter and you just say "All my
computers have Linux", and people understand you very well. They
understand that even better than "GNU Linux". And being understood is
the most important thing.
Even if you insist on those things beeing different OS's, the term "GNU
Linux" is not suitable for distinguishing them.

Because it _is_ common you don't need to name it. Understanding "GNU
Linux" in that sense is almost the same as saying "A man with two eyes
and a nose". No. One says "A man with red hair" and analogical "Redhat
Linux" or "SUSE Linux".

If those things become common some day, "GNU Linux" might become useful
to distinguish them. if one-eyed people become common some day, the term
"man with two eyes" becomes useful too.

That makes some sense, but it is still ridiculous. Not even MS insists
on "Microsoft Windows", you are allowed to say "Windows". 
Names are just for expressing your thoughts. They are different from
desriptions, and they are different from credits. And that purpose
serves plain "Linux" best.
