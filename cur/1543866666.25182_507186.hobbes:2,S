It's OK as long as the 64-bit kernel, N32 and O32 userspace all agree
there there's 32 bits of padding between the fields of this structure:
struct epoll_event {
        __u32 events;
        __u64 data;
};
I suspect it's a fairly safe bet that N32 userspace agrees; if the O32
ABI is different then it would need the compat syscall.
