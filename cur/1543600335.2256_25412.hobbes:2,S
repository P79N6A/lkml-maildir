Subject: PCI (?) problems of MSI K7T266 Pro = MS-6380 / VIA KT266 8233

Hallo,
I have Microstar mainboard MSI K7T266 Pro (MS-6380) with 
VIA KT266 chipset (VIA 8233), Athlon 1200/266, linux-2.4.9
Does anybody with this mainboard have some problems (or using it
succesfull), or should I suspect some bad setup / problematic PCI card
or more particular bugs?
Thanks for any info (please reply to my e-mail address)
I have encountered many, probably PCI related problems:
- USB PC2PC driver sometimes looses data errors (cca once per 20MB)
- SCSI scanner sometimes hangs scanning
- SCSI CD-ROM/writer sometimes fails to mount CD-ROM (read errors)
- Mangled sound output from AC97 codec
- PCI bus cannot be overclocked to more than 34.5 MHz
Used patches:
defined VIA_NEW_BRIDGES_TESTED uncommented in drivers/ide/via82cxxx.c
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/garloff/linux/dc395/
 (driver for SCSI DC315U)
ftp://ftp.penguin.cz/pub/users/utx/linux-kernel/
 (driver for USB PC2PC cable)
Compiler: gcc-2.95.3 & gcc-3.0.1
I have tried to activate all PCI quirks and special inits from older
chipsets without any success.
I cannot test my machine with other OS.
