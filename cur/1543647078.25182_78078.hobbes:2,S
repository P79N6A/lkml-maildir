Yes, we have made proposals in the past to change the way ext2/3 EAs are
stored on disk, but nobody has had time to work on it yet.  The current
limitations of 4kB of EA per inode (user+system) is bad, as is the fact
that you need a full block for each inode if you have any unique
per-inode data (basically anything other than ACLs).
That said, the benefits of the current EA implementation far outweigh the 
limitations, and since this is an internal-to-ext2/3 issue, we can
change it at some later date without affecting the rest of the kernel.
Cheers, Andreas
