Ok, events are sent to DBUS now, including the additional string
information [1]. Code (for now, it's not "done" yet!) is here [2].
I'll ask the DBUS guys whether it's usefull to get this (optionally)
directly into DBUS.
Let's hope other kernel devs will also start introducing events into
their code! :-)
