I could wait 3 months with my comments like you did with your reply, but
I think I'll be a bit more timely, as I hope that you will be next time.

You forgot:
	Fix coding style
	Fix mix of whitespace (tabs and spaces)
Which you said you fixed up, but according to the code, you didn't :(
Also please add:
	Use kref instead of atomic counters
	Address Greg's comments about the fs.
I'll wait for these things to all get fixed up before reviewing the code
again.
thanks,
