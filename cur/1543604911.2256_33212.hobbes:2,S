So make the CRC32 code a module itself ?

That is in practice an unuseable "priority" (I'd like to consider that a
highly stochastic variable :) 
Not to mention that as an individual sub-project maintainer you can't go
around changing higher level makefiles all the time just to get your
particular initcall chain in order (again, in practice).
You could _conceivably_ build an initcall dependency system by adding some
"initcall_requires" macros which put the dependant other calls into
another linker table, which the kernel would resolve at boot.
