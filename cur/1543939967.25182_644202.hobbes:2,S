Well after trying a lot of writev combinations, I've reproduced a hang
*hangs head*.
Does this help?
Zero length iovecs can go into an infinite loop in writev, because the
iovec iterator does not always advance over them.
The sequence required to trigger this is not trivial. I think it requires
that a zero-length iovec be followed by a non-zero-length iovec which causes
a pagefault in the atomic usercopy. This causes the writev code to drop back
into single-segment copy mode, which then tries to copy the 0 bytes of the
zero-length iovec; a zero length copy looks like a failure though, so it
loops.
Put a test into iov_iter_advance to catch zero-length iovecs. We could just
put the test in the fallback path, but I feel it is more robust to skip
over zero-length iovecs throughout the code (iovec iterator may be used in
filesystems too, so it should be robust).
