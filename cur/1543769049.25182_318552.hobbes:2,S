I don't have any specific suggestion regarding layout or usage patterns
besides pointing to remap_file_pages() being significantly lighter-weight
than mmap() for the purposes of virtual windowing. The other aspects of
all this (and even the use of remap_file_pages() at all) are, of course,
at your own discretion. It is, however, notable that Oracle has had some
success with a tactic similar to what you describe, where few objects are
used and the application instead manages space within the objects
dedicated to various purposes.
In general, I'd recommend experimenting with different strategies to see
which works best for you. This is all rather vague, and the mechanics of
getting all this working with your application are sure to have enough
alternative implementations to merit some decision-making and the like.
