Hi,
being inspired by some book about optimizing c++ code i decided to do
timing of functions i wrote. I am using gettimeofday to set
two timeval structs and calculate the time between them.
But the results depend heavily on the load, also i reckon that this
is an innacurate timing.
Any ideas on timing a function, or a block of code? Maybe some kernel
timers or something.
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
