Uhh ?
please try to start 4 xterms through your firewall, then work for 100s in
one of them, then only start to use anyone of the other ones. If it's hung,
maybe you'll remember how low you put the timeout, and think about all those
users coming to you complaining that they only have to stop typing to talk
to someone before they find their xemacs, xterms, etc... dead.
I've seen several firewalls which caused trouble by breaking connections
after 2 hours of idle, while applications used a default keep-alive of 4
hours. Eventhough 5 days may seem a bit long for some usages (eg: frontal
web servers), several hours is not that much for internal firewalls.
