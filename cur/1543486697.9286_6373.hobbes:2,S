# (CONFIGURE CTL0044/962642 (LD 2

	I got just this in my isapnp.conf and it didn't work :( in fact i
have tried with isapnp and the bios PnP configuration but none has worked,
under linux it's the only think with problems, everythink else works great
with  2.2.1 kernel.....What could it be ??? 
	Thanks for answering !!!
	Greetings....
