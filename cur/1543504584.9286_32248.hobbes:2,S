Small. A little CPU-overhead. Swapping involves IO and that's much
slower than the CPU anyway.

Depends if you're going to use them. The outer tracks are the fastest.
You might want to reserve them for your root filesystem which you
actually use, or you might want to decide that you're going to swap on
a regular basis, and want that extra juice out of the swap partition.

I still recommend the archaic rule-of-thumb: Twice as much swap as
physical RAM. Why? RAM is many times more expensive as disk. So at
"twice as much as RAM", you'd still pay somethng like 20 times more
for the RAM than for the disk (I didn't check current prices. Sorry)
But with current RAM-sizes you might never touch your swap. In that
case, you're better off finding some use for those faster tracks. If
on the other hand, you're poor, and can't pay for the extra RAM, or
are regularly handling extremely large data-sets, then putting it 
at the beginning (outer tracks) will help.

Yeah. Covered above.

Yes: Total swap = 2 x RAM.

So, the question is: Does the rule-of-thumb work good enough for you?
Is 256Mb swap enough?
Today, a machine shouldn't need swap, but for that once-a-month event
where you happen to forget that a job is much larger than expected, it
is good to have it: the job will continue. And for that service you have
to pay the insurance fee of a swap partition.
