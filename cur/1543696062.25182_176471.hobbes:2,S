Hi, 
Modifications of existing files via NFS are not picked up by the
directory notification system.
kernel is 2.4.22, I'm testing with the example program from
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/dnotify.txt
I get notifications on the following: 
nfs-server# echo hello >> existing.file   
nfs-client# echo hello > new.file
But not on this: 
nfs-client# echo hello >> existing.file 
I guess the problem of detecting changes done via NFS is similar to
the problem of multiple hard-links to the same file, which is
documented as not supported.
Is this something that can be fixed, or is it going to be too
difficult to go from NFS-handle and back to the directory it came
from?
