more flexibility in building the sched_domains is badly needed, so
your effort towards providing this is the right step. I'm not sure
yet whether your big change is really (and already) a simplification,
but what you described sounded for me like getting the chance to
configure the sched_domains at runtime, dynamically, from user
space. I didn't notice any user interface in your patch, or overlooked
it. Could you please describe the API you had in mind for that?
Regards,
Erich
