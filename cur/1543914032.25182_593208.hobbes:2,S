Thanks for your comments, here is a new patch (bowler.patch) reflecting the changes you suggested. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly for such cosmetic changes, the code still hangs.
I have added a great many debugging statements in order to pinpoint the problem (backtrace.patch); surprisingly, my custom backtraces didn't show up in the console, but a kernel call trace did (call_trace).
Here is the contents of the offending function. The {enter,exit}_func() calls are my debugging statements, and I have verified that only the else branch was compiled. As you can see, there are only function calls here, no memory manipulation nor dereferencing at all. What could possibly fail in this function? Shouldn`t the backtrace include one of the subcalls?
  void nl_spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lockptr, DWORD *flagptr)
  {
  enter_func(__LINE__);
  #if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,7))
          assert(lockptr);
          assert(flagptr);
          spin_lock_irqsave((spinlock_t *)lockptr, (*flagptr));
  #else
          spin_lock_irq((spinlock_t *)lockptr);
  #endif
  exit_func(__LINE__);
  }
