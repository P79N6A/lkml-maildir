The definition I gave was "should be readable by ptrace", and so it works
if that's how you categorize all execute-only pages.  But...

Given that concern, I'll agree with your assessment.

Currently, none are (because pte_user is only true of the vsyscall page).
For each individual arch, it seems reasonable enough to me to just have
special cases rather than testing the page tables.  Rather than the code
now in #ifdef FIXADDR_START it could just call an arch_get_user_pages
function to check for magic user addresses without vmas.
Linus's suggested change is obviously the minimal change from what we have
now.  But the arch_get_user_pages idea might be the more conservative
implementation compared to the status quo before my get_user_pages patch.
Thanks,
Roland
