voluntary adds a few more cond_resched() points.

With BLP, AFAIK code may not assume preemption is disabled. Debug checks
should have caught any offenders by now.
When there is no kernel preemption, I guess BLP still allows contenders
to sleep and switch rather than spin, so it might improve throughput (or
harm it!).

Yeah, they're all slightly different I think, but it probably is too much
config options at this point in time. I think Ingo plans to make BLP the
default and remove the config option.
