This code looks suspiciously like the code which Miguel came up to solve
some virtual aliasing problem in the IRIX binary compatibility stuff.  Not
only that I believe this was the wrong solution for the particular problem
in question at that time; it's also not a suitable solution for most DMA
problems.
