I'm sorry to piggy-back this thread.
Could it be what I'm experiencing in the following bugzilla report:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7372
As I explained in the report, I see this issue only since 2.6.18.
So if your concern is related to mine, what could have changed between
2.6.17 and 2.6.18 related to this?
Unfortunately it is not possible to git bisect this issue as my problem
appears on a live database server. One of the reporter could git-bisect
to a SATA+SCSI patch, but looking at it I can't really see what's wrong.
As soon as I will be able to build a 2.6.18 minus this patch we could
verify both of us are dealing with the same issue or not.
I'm ready to help any kernel developper who wants to look at my issue.
Just ask what debug material you need and I'll try to provide it.
