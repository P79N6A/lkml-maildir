I applaud that, but I end up spending all my time on email, and I suspect 
that's true for most of the core developers. So I actually suspect that 
you'll get much better community and testing from offering these things at 
Linux users groups, and similar places where you find people who may be 
really interested in getting into something new, and don't already have 
some kernel subsystem that they are basically maintaining full time..
Not that offering them to known kernel developers is _bad_, mind you, but 
I think you'll actually find that a lot of them end up being so busy with 
their current thing that they don't have much time for another 
architecture. I know I do..
