Adding multi-segment support on top of this is not going to be a huge
job since the new code already does a form of multi-segment tracking in
the lower layers. By that I mean that it has to convert an arbitrarily
sized user buffer into a series of asynchronous NFS requests to be put
on the wire and then track them until they have completed. That is
pretty much all you have to do for the multi-iovec case too.
