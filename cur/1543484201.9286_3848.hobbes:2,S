I know I'm coming in a bit late, but I'm just a few days from my
defence, so please bear with me :-)   I only have two comment to the
this story:

That's not quite fair to Russell.  His package drivers were (are?)
working under different constraint: DOS, and the 1989 state-of-the-art
PC :-) 512 bytes was an awful lot for a resident driver at the time.
But his reasons might have been different.  In any case, the real
achivement important issue was proof of concept.
Btw, table lookup can be fairly expensive if it results in a cache
miss.  I remain unconvinced of the inherent advantage of either
option.

Sorry, but that's BS.  We definitely can (and maybe should) change the
protocol.  When we worked on 8-bit PLIP we had no such reservation.
As I've stated whenever possible, the situation for 8-bit PLIP has
changed dramatically with the advent of ECP+EPP ports.  Motivated
hackers might be able to come up with something actually nice, in
contrast to PLIP which will never be able to work well (that's the
reason I lost interest).
While I'm at this, I believe that emulating an ethernet adapter bears
way to much overhead.  It seems much more logical and efficient to use 
the PPP protocal over the parallel wire.  After all, PLIP is all about 
a point-to-point protocol.  It might even make the driver simpler,
making it behave just like a supercharged serial port.
Keep up the good work Alexander!
Just my 0,05 Euro,
