Well, there will be one. :-)  For example, one should be able to use a 2.6.25+
boot kernel to load the image containing 2.6.24-rc6 and restore the memory
state from it.

Not that much different indeed.  The hibernation code is more focused on
restoring the pre-hibernation state of the system rather than anything else,
plus on ACPI systems we try to handle the platform in accordance with the
specification (to some extent - you'd have to use a non-ACPI boot kernel to
follow the specification literally, which is possible but not straightforward).
