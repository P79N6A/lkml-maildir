Hi,
	My lsmod gives the following output.
Module                  Size  Used by
cdc_acm                11040  3 
usbcore               112084  4 cdc_acm
1) I would like to know which functions are increasing the reference
count of cdc_acm ? How do i find it out for some other module whose
reference count is being increased? Any place where i can find it. 
2)Which devices are using cdc_acm ?
3)Which applications are increasing the reference count of cdc_acm and
usb_core ?
