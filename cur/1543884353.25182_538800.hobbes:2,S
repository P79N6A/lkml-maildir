Brain dump before crashing for the night:
The patch refuses to clobber already-present pagetable entries of
whatever origin. There are pagetables prior to this setup covering the
address range just above PAGE_OFFSET. If this theory is correct, you
should only be able to go a few MB above PAGE_OFFSET before encountering
unreadable kernel memory. IIRC those pagetables are a statically
allocated array in assembly; altering that array to set supervisor bits
may resolve it, though it may also be freed as initmem.
