Okay, here's a version for 2.6.23 and 2.6.22...
Christoph, you've now Acked the 2.6.24 one, thanks:
do you agree this patch below should go to -stable?
Slub has been quite leaky under load.  Taking mm_struct as an example, in
a loop of swapping kernel builds, after the first iteration slabinfo shows:
Name        Objects Objsize    Space Slabs/Part/Cpu  O/S O %Fr %Ef Flg
mm_struct        55     840    73.7K         18/7/4    4 0  38  62 A
but Objects and Partials steadily creep up - after the 340th iteration:
mm_struct       110     840   188.4K        46/36/4    4 0  78  49 A
(example taken from 2.6.24-rc1: YMMV).
The culprit turns out to be __slab_alloc(), where it copes with the race
that another task has assigned the cpu slab while we were allocating one.
Don't rush off to load_freelist there: that assumes page->lockless_freelist
is empty, and will lose all its free slots when page->freelist is not empty.
Instead just do a local allocation from lockless_freelist when it has one.
Which fixes the leakage: Objects and Partials then remain stable.

Version of patch suitable and recommended for both 2.6.23-stable and
2.6.22-stable.  I've not run tests on either to observe the mounting
leakage; but a version of the patch below with a printk announcing
when non-empty freelist would overwrite non-empty lockless_freelist
does indeed show up in both (though notably less frequently than in
2.6.24-rc1 - something else seems to be making it more likely now).
But please wait for Christoph's Ack before committing to -stable.
