Except that the individual drivers are a lot of the time written by
different people, live in different portions of the tree, and are
combined into different combinations depending on the chipset.
For i2c devices, I see the scx200_acb, i2c-elektor, i2c-sis5595, and
i2c-sis630 drivers needing this.  The last one happens to share the pci
device with a video driver, that doesn't always need to be / want to be
loaded by users just so they can read the temperature of their
processors.
Oh, the EDAC code also needs this, and I know that no one wants to merge
that stuff into their individual drivers :)
Same goes for framebuffer vs. DRM.  Yeah, I know DRM ended up "winning"
here, but for some hardware setups, both are still valid, and it really
would be good for both drivers to be notified when the system is about
to go into suspend/resume and other stuff like that.
If the driver core can provide this in a simple manner, I think it is
worth it, especially as there are lots of hardware that seems to need
it.
