   None-the-less, it seems to me that spamming the kernel namespace
   with "current" in at least the way that the 2.2 kernels do (does
   this occur in later kernels?) should be corrected.
Justin, "current" is a pointer to the current thread executing on the
current processor under Linux.  It has existed since day one of the
Linux kernel and probably will exist till the end of it's life.
I'm sure the BSD kernel has some similar bogosity :-)
