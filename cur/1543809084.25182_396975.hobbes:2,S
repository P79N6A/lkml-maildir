To establish a baseline of understanding and because you made an assertion
that is counter to my understanding.

Except for instances where you need an atomic read/modify/write the
only primitives you have are reads, writes and barriers. 
I have all of the correct reads and writes therefore the only thing
that could help are barriers if the logic is otherwise sane.
A write barrier to ensure the write of flags is visible before I write
the kill signal will ensure the write of flags is globally visible
first.  Although I am having a hard time convincing myself even that
matters.

The assumes that release_task() is called synchronously with do_exit
which is not the case.  Looking at the code I do think release_task()
for the pspace leader can be called too soon.  But that is really
has nothing to do with whether or not all of it's children got sent
SIGKILL.
That is a significant issue, that needs to be fixed before I submit
this piece of code for inclusion into the kernel.
The issue is depending on the context is that a process actively running
in kernel space could proceed for a long time before it returns to user
space and receives a signal.  In that span of time it could execute just
about any code in the kernel.
Kirill thank you for spotting this.  
This exchange seems to have a hostile and not a cooperative tone so
I will finish the investigation and bug fixing elsewhere.
I expect that there might be a few more issues like this.  My only
expectation was that the code was complete enough to discuss semantics
and kernel mechanisms for creating a namespaces, and the code has
successfully served that purpose.
