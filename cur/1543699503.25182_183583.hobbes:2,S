Um, no.
That is a very bad idea.  Your suggestion would make it impossible to
actually write a block of all-zeros to the disk.  That makes it
impossible to pre-allocate disk space.
Another syscall is precisely the correct thing to do.  (I don't think
make_hole() is a special case of any extant syscall.)
