hello.. i have a small problem with inotify in kernel 2.6.13-rc3-git4 -
i do not get the inotify device, i know i build it in,
gzcat /proc/config.gz | grep -i inotify confirms it, and i have a very
new udev, where inotify is in the rules file, i tried udevstart but it
did not create me the inotify device..
anyone that can help? perhaps a fix is known?
