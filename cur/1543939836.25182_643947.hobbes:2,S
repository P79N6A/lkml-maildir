it was posted three months ago to lkml (the upteenth time) and we picked 
it up into x86.git a month ago. KGDB has been problem-free in x86.git 
ever since.

at least as far as x86.git went the arch impact was refreshingly small. 
There was some feedback that was addressed by Jason. (If any feedback is 
still unaddressed then let us know - or if there are any new comments 
i'm sure they will be addressed prompty - please keep the comments 
coming!)
As more architectures enable support for KGDB, any specific objections 
can and should be addressed on that level. (That's how we did it for 
genirq and dynticks and that went far better than "address all 
architecture concerns at once" - which delays merges forever. We'd still 
be discussing irq flows versus flat irqs and clockevents versus drivers 
if we did it like that.)
