yes, they were clean.  Its a 1500kva Belkin, not exactly a small ups.

ISTR that was the second time an un-logged powerdown has been done since 
that kernel became the default.  For all practical purposes, it the equ of 
tapping the hard reset button and before it can start to reboot, the 4 
second powerdown expires and things get real quiet.
I guess I'm 'waiting for the other shoe to drop'  Until that time, 
everything seems normal.  But I did just note that 'fam' is using up to 
99.3% of the cpu, which is unusual considering that amanda is also 
running, and its usually gtar thats the hog.  This is according to htop.
That doesn't seem to be what I'd expect to see, thats for sure.  Even 
wierder, I just used htop to send it a SIGHUP and its now gone.  WTF??  Me 
wanders off for some sleep while the real brains ponder that one.
