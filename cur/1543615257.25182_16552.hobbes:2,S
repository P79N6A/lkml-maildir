The System.map question brings up several more:
1. Is it correct to say that System.map is basically
the software interrupt table? ( and that for Linux
software Interrupts equal syscalls)
2. If one doesn't have vmlinux lying around, is there
an easy way to recreate this (via a syscall or small
SUID root C program to dump out the vectors)
3. Wouldn't it be a good idea to allow for System.map
to be handled automagically like Lilo and Grub handle
different kernels?  If only to avoid this confusion and
those pesky "ps" warnings.
4. Why does "ps" really care about System.map?
