Hello
        I'm having same problems booting SMP-enabled kernels. I just mailed
the list asking for help, but I could not provide more information abount
the mainboard (it's a Asus dual P3, via chipset, don't remember the model).
The messages are very similar (if not equal) to yours. I was able to boot to
the end disabling APM support, but the boot process itself became unstable
(some times it booted, some times not, just like you).
