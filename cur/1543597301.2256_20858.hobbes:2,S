That was me. nfsd started to use "daemonize" so it shared the umask
(and rest of current->fs, and other stuff) with init, so we changed
the default umask to 0 as knfsd didn't want any umask getting in the
way.
It seems that someone at Redhat changed their init so that it set the
umask back to 0022, and this affected nfsd badly.
Linus has just accepted a patch which makes nfsd completely
independant of the umask setting, and sets the default umask back to
0022.  You should see it in 2.4.7-pre7
For more info, look for the thread in linux-kernel with
    [PATCH] Bug in NFS
in the subject.
