I saw here that it was widely merged :

"Finish of the PPC merge into kernel 2.4.18 
 Posted by Olivier Reisch on Friday January 11th, 2002 12:11:39 PM
 Linux 2.4.18-pre3 is available and with it, the larger PPC merge with 
2.4.18 has been accomplished. The official kernel.org sources are now 
almost up to par with the official stable PPC tree. Thus, it should 
compile fine on most PPC machines and include the latest features."
So I used a stock kernel. In fact it runs very well apart from these ext3
problems.--
