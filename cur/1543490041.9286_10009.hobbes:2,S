OK, I'll agree that is remote, but the pedantic wimp in me would
still like to see this 2^(-32) probability considerably lower... it
does seem conceivable somewhere sometime in the world, this will
occur.
Also, this is for each file open is it not?  Doesn't that drastically
increase the probability of getting collisions? (I don't really
understand the intricacies involves here, so I'm not clear on whether
or not this is more or less linear or otherwise).

32 `random' bits isn't a whole lot of security IMO.

Can you not seed it once every 100 times and use a LFSR in between?
Arguably, get_random_bytes could do/should this for us or perhaps we
have a get_weak_random bytes for this purpose.

OK

I'm going to cc' this to Colim Plumb as he often has good comment to
make about such things....
