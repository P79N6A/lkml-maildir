I agree with you on all points.  No need for it to be done in the same
patch as Balbir's, but yes, __GFP_RECLAIMABLE appears to be appropriate
for the page_cgroup kmem_cache.
(I think it's a better fit than for the radix_tree_node cache: though
the common pagecache usage of the radix_tree implies that its nodes
are reclaimable, I can't see why radix_tree nodes would intrinsically
be reclaimable.  If a significant non-reclaimable user of radix-tree
comes on the scene, I'd expect us to change that assumption.)
