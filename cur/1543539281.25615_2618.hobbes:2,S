This is the standard lecture, but don't take it too far.  You can control
a robot with deterministic latecnies under 50 usecs, but not with 
deterministic latencies of 10 minutes.

You understate the difficulties by using this form of argument.  I'd
like my 1992 V4 Ford Ranger Pickup to fly at Mach 3 at 35,000 feet.
The truck already leaves the ground for short periods
if I drive over bumps.  So it already has an aircraft requirement and
I only want to shift the flight curve to a level I find acceptable.
Should be simple, no?
