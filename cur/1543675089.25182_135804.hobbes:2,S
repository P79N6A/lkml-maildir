10/15 performance drop doesn't sound good, no matter what hardware ;).
However in contest I recall there was quite an improvement in latency at
least (I mean, it had some positive effect too)
Getting the best throughput and latency at the same time is normally not
possible, however evaluating if it's losing excessive throughput given a
certain latency improvement is difficult.

I'll try to find what's the precise reason of the interactivity drop
with the 2.4.18->2.4.19 blkdev changes on Thu. I think I shortly looked
into it once but there was no definitive answer, or anyways going back
to the 2.4.18 code didn't appeal or make much sense.
However I suspect this responsiveness issue could be storage hardware
dependent.
The sentence by Linus in the last few days while talking with Jens,
about storage that reorders stuff and starve requests at the two ends of
the platter was very scary, maybe you're really bitten by something like
that. Linux does the right thing but your hardware keeps posting stuff
under the os and mine doesn't.
