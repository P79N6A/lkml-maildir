AFAIU preempt_disable increments preempt count of the current task, so that 
nobody will take the cpu which it is executing on (scheduler doesn't allow that) 
while the task is running until preempt count lowers to 0. How do you mean the 
"disabling preemption on local processor", how/why would you want to disable 
preemption of task potentially running on the other one?
