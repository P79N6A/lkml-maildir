Simply because I want to be able to share the software page tables with 
the hardware page tables.
Not sharing the page tables implies that you have to have two copies and 
keep them in sync, which is almost certainly going to make fork/exec just 
suck badly.
Now I agree with you that in the long range all the hardware will just use
a 64k pagesize or we'll have extents or whatever.  I'm not saying that
trees are the only good way to populate a VM, it's just the currently
dominant way, and as long as it's the dominant way I want to have the 
common mapping be the 1:1 mapping.
