most of the cpu overhead comes from HZ=1000. Especial with SCHED_FIFO
there should be minimal (if any) impact from the scheduler changes -
SCHED_FIFO tasks get all CPU time, no ifs and whens.
could people who experience tvtime performance problems apply the patch
below to change HZ back to 100? Does it have any impact?
