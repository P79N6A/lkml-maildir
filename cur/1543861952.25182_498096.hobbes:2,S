Yes, I agree with all, that was what I have in mind too.
And by registering all SHED_OTHER threads with the same priority MAX_RT_PRIO, we 
have exactly this behavior, I think :
* the plist, when used with only one priority, behaves exactly as a simple list
(plist is a double simple list: first list contains all nodes sorted by 
priority, second list contains the first element of each "priority-based" 
sub-list of the first one):
Thus, when only one priority is used, there is nothing to sort at each add 
operation. (first list contains all elements by FIFO order, second list contains 
one element). So the overhead in this case is minimal and quasi-null.
* Now, if a SCHED_FIFO thread comes to the plist, its priority will be lower 
than MAX_RT_PRIO and it will be "naturally" sorted by prio order, and thus, it 
will be woken before the SCHED_OTHER threads because of its higher priority 
(i.e. lower prio-value in the kernel).
But there can be a performance impact when several processes use different 
futexes which have the same hash key.
In fact, the plist contains all waiters _of_all_futexes_ having the same hash 
key, not only the waiters of a given futex. This can be more a problem, if one 
process uses SCHED_FIFO threads, and the other SCHED_OTHER: the first will 
penalize the second...  but even in this case, as the second has a lower 
priority, this can be acceptable, I think ?
