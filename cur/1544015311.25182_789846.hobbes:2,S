James I just found that my previous commits in net-next-2.6 could
be breaking the user side apps. I mean when cardmap was here
ppp_create_interface does not fail if user-side application
has asked not for'new' (ie -1) unit but some predefined number not
being used before so any PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl call with new unit number was
serviced by ppp module successfully. As only I've introduced idr
technique I missed such a case and now any PPPIOCNEWUNIT call
will not mark unit as 'reserved'. That is why I asked if l2tp
does work without these 'namespace' related patches.
I'm investigating this issue now. It seems idr can't guarantee
to allocate predefined id number (it could be 'equal' or 'above').
Maybe we would have to revert these commits
(commits 7a95d267fb62cd6b80ef73be0592bbbe1dbd5df7 and 
 ab5024ab23b78c86a0a1425defcdde48710fe449).
But this issue is not related to what you have now.

| 
I don't think it should be like that since net_device is 'net-namespace'
bound. At least register_netdevice() retrieve *net from device being
registered so I suppose devices with same names but in different
namespace could take place. I'll recheck.
Thanks for testing James!
