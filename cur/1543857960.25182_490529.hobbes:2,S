I am afraid to report that this second version also fails for me, as you 
point out CIFS can break us if defined.  In fact we used to get away 
with this on my test system due to ordering magic luck, I presume the 
move to __initdata has triggered this.  Much as I agree that this is 
wrong we are still going to break people with this.
Before:
Module list:	sym53c8xx reiserfs
Kernel version:	2.6.19-git12-autokern1 (powerpc)
Kernel image:	/boot/vmlinuz-autobench
Initrd image:	/boot/initrd-autobench.img.new
Shared libs:	lib/ld-2.3.3.so lib/libc.so.6 lib/libselinux.so.1
Cannot determine dependencies of module sym53c8xx. Is modules.dep up to 
date?
Modules:	
none
5735 blocks
After:
Module list:	sym53c8xx reiserfs
Kernel version:	 (powerpc)
Kernel image:	/boot/vmlinuz-autobench
Initrd image:	/boot/initrd-autobench.img.new
No modules found for kernel
