Sorry for our mess mail, but we want to improve linux kernel.
We are glad to announce the 1st release of USAGI Project. The "USAGI"
means UniverSAl playGround for Ipv6. It is the IPv6 development project
for Linux operating systems mainly.
As many other operating systems and routers, the Linux kernel has
its original IPv6 implementation.  However, the development was done
long time ago and the implementation is not up-to-dated. Many important
features such as IPsec and NDP are missing or miss-implemented.
Considering the situation, we have started USAGI Project with WIDE Project,
KAME Project and TAHI Project in August 2000. 
The USAGI Project is managed by volunteers and aims to provide
better IPv6 environment on Linux freely. We try to improve Linux kernel,
IPv6 related libraries and IPv6 applications.
Please visit 
http://www.linux-ipv6.org/
 for further details.
Today, November 1st, we are glad to announce 1st official release from
USAGI Project. At the release, we include the following three packages.
- Linux Kernel-2.4.0-test9-usagi-20001101a
	Based on Linux Kernel-2.4.0-test9, we have improved and
