While I'm not removing the brown paper bag from my head, I was unable to
reproduce the BUG on my 2-way x86_64 at home. I then noticed Miles'
system is x86_32. After wrangling with our testing grid, I got a 32-bit
system booting 2.6.24-git22. Didn't reproduce there either, with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y. What am I doing wrong? I think the
following is the right fix, but have not see the original BUG to know
for sure. I did the `find /proc | xargs tail`, but shouldn't I hit the
BUG just simply `cat`'ing or `echo`ing into the file?
Miles, could you test the following?
Thanks,
Nish
hugetlb: fix overcommit locking
proc_doulongvec_minmax() calls copy_to_user()/copy_from_user(), so we
can't hold hugetlb_lock over the call. Use a dummy variable to store the
sysctl result, like in hugetlb_sysctl_handler(), then grab the lock to
update nr_overcommit_huge_pages.
