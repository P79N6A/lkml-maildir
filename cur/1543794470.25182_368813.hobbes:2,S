Subject: [IDEA] Enable debugging in userspace?

Today, one idea is floating around me and bugging my brain (read: headache).
If I could be a newbie, and if I have a problem with the latest and greatest 
linux distro, I start googling and looking for a solution. The problem is 
that someone write that I have to enable debugging mode in kernel 
configuration, recompile everything and reboot. That's quite impossible for a 
newbie, isn't it?
So, why don't add an option to enable/disable debugging mode in sysfs?
Like:
/* DEBUG MODE ON */
echo "1" > /sys/kernel/debugging/debug_mode
/* DEBUG MODE OFF */
echo "0" > /sys/kernel/debugging/debug_mode
I know that debugging code might (remove "might") increase the kernel size, 
but men, we have >256MB of RAM and >1GB of hard drive space.
I'm not subscribed to the ML but I read that on lkml.org
BR,
