First, is there any specific kernel version where this started to happen 
to you, or is this long-standing bug you have been experiencing with older

It would be useful if you could compile your kernel with CONFIG_HID_DEBUG 
and send the output both from the time the keyboard is connected and also 
when things go wild.
