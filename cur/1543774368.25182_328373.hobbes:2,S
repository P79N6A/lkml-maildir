Feedback on (1) seems positive so far, so now moving to (2), here are
the patches that implement the changes to make filesystem AIO read
and write truly asynchronous even without O_DIRECT. With these patches
in place it will no longer be necessary for the POSIX AIO library
(from Sébastien et al) to force O_DIRECT and memcpy for alignment.
(Samba should find this useful)
There are 2 patches: one for buffered filesystem AIO read and the other
for buffered filesystem AIO O_SYNC write. These build on the AIO wait bit
integration patches posted earlier.
Comments would be appreciated.
The full patchset including (1) and (2) above is available at
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/2612
