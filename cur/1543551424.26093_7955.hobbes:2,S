Yes. If you see how to do it - patches are welcome. One of the possible
ways is to create a structure when you register driver, remove it upon
rmmod, replace ->b_dev and friends with pointers to that structure and
make the removal of this beast invalidate the buffers. 2.5 fodder, unless
you can push that sort of changes past Linus right now. And I _really_
doubt it - requires changing all drivers and you know the chances to
minimize the patch size by clever (ab)use of preprocessor.
