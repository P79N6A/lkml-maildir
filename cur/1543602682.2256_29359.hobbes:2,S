	Rendering - definitely agree. Userspace.
	Mode changing - Now there I can get into an argument. I
still (after all these years) feel that the Kernel is the best
place to put video mode control. That way 'killall -9 X' isn't
nearly as nasty... The kernel could at least get you back to
a text console.
	And now that XFree86 4 has a vm86 system to 'run the
Video BIOS' for certain cards, it shouldn't be to hard to 
emulate the old OS/2 system - in a vm86 session, use the BIOS
to switch to all the supported modes, and record (via vm86
io traps) everything the BIOS does. Then, in the driver,
just 'play back' the scripts... Worked beatifully for OS/2
back in the day for 2D framebuffers...
	Anyway, I'll just let sleeping dogs lie and leave it
at that.

	As do I, but I lack three things: The time, The Specs, and
The Hardware. :(
