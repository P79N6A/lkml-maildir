The fs-independent options are parsed in user space by mount(8), and are
passed into the kernel as individual bits in a `flags' argument.
So we'd need a new `rootopts=0x0040' thingy to support this.  But given
that most things can be set after boot with `mount / -o remount,noatime',
it may not be necessary.
