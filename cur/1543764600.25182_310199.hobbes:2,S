Quick follow up:  I decided to disable the DMA controller as a near term
solution.  This works but it is not optimal for obvious reasons.
I believe that the chipset initialization for utilizing the DMA controller
is incorrectly setup, for the particular model I am using (CMD 648).  I
don't know when/if I will look into this further.
For more information regarding my analysis of the problem refer to my
first email, with the email subject as "IDE CMD 64x PCI driver."
