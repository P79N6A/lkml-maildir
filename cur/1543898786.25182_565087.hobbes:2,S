Hello,
Is there any reason why sd is printing the driver informations for each 
disk twice in dmesg ?
...
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 35843670 512-byte hardware sectors (18352 MB)
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 9f 00 10 08
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, supports 
DPO and FUA

sda: sda1
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
sd 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
etc
...
Is a bit annoying and floodish ;) on boxes with a lot SCSI , *ATA disks.
