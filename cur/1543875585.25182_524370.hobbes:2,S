is there room for improvement in security_port_sid() ?
little test with dns queries (dnsfilter (the client) on local host
using poll() and dnscache (the server) using epoll (at max 4000 concurrent
queries):
(stats for only vmlinux)
CPU: P4 / Xeon, speed 2797.32 MHz (estimated)
Counted GLOBAL_POWER_EVENTS events (time during which processor is not stopped) with a unit mask of 0x01 (mandatory) count 45000
Counted FSB_DATA_ACTIVITY events (DRDY or DBSY events on the front side bus) with a unit mask of 0x03 (multiple flags) count 45000
Counted BRANCH_RETIRED events (retired branches) with a unit mask of 0x05 (multiple flags) count 45000
Counted BRANCH_RETIRED events (retired branches) with a unit mask of 0x0a (multiple flags) count 45000

if dnsfilter had used epoll, security_port_sid would
probably (?) be number one (or two or three) CPU user in kernel.
also note that 17.6% of mispredicted branches occurr in security_port_sid.
