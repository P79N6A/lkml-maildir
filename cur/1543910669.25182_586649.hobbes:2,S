I disagree here. First thing, you dont want to have the virtual cpu in a 
different process than the hypervisor control code for that cpu. Otherwise  
communication has to be made via IPC. 
Secondly, Its not qemu/kvm that does the accouting. Its existing userspace 
code like top/snmp agents and clients! etc. that would require additional 
knowledge which thread is guest code.
I personally like the approach Laurent has taken. Maybe it needs some polish 
and maybe we want an account_guest_time function, but in general I think he 
is doing the right thing.
