If you had searched the LKML archives you would soon have found out
that the floppy driver is known to be broken since 2.5.13.
A partial fix exists which eliminates the oopses and allows raw
/dev/fd0 accesses to work; VFS accesses to mounted floppies are
still broken however. You can get it from the -dj patch or from
