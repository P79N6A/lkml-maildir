   Yep, but it really doesn't have too many options (sic pun ;))..
   i.e. The max the options can add are 40 bytes, speaking
   strictly TCP, not IP. This really should fit into one extra
   cacheline for most architectures, at most, right?
It's what the bottom of the header is aligned to, but
we build the packet top to bottom not the other way around.
