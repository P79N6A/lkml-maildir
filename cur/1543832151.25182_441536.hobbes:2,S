I was under the impression that 2.6.16.y was staying open for a much 
longer time, as per Adrian's "2.6.16 long living kernel" announcement a 
short while back.
I just assumed that the Greg and Chris were handling it until 2.6.18 
gets released, and then Adrian takes over 2.6.16.y while the [stable] 
team moves on to 2.6.17.y and 2.6.18.y ...  Was this an incorrect 
assumption?
...and if not, should 2.6.16.y patches always be sent to 
stable@kernel.org, or will Adrian have an alternate method for accepting 
patches?
