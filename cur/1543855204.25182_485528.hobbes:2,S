I've been using RDTSC in pktgen.  For my app, I am just trying to find a 
quick
way to determine if X nano-seconds have elapsed.  If it's occasionally 
off by a small amount,
that is OK as I have higher-level control logic that will correct 
long-term trends.
After poking around, I ended up just exporting sched_clock() and using that
instead of directly using RDTSC, but that was mostly just for convenience.
If RDTSC is not a good choice for the use I describe above, is there a 
better
method that is still very fast (as compared to do_gettimeofday())?
Thanks,
Ben
