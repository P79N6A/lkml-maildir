This is actually not correct if you consider the i2c_detect() design, but
happens to cause no problem in this specific case - and, ironically,
might even speed up the detection loop.
The way i2c_detect() works for now, it will stop probing a given adapter
as soon as one address probed on that bus returned an error. As it
happens that i2c_is_isa_adapter(adapter) is either true or false for all
addresses of a given adapter, skipping to the next adapter directly when
the bus type (isa or not) doesn't match actually makes sense.
At any rate, I have plans to rework the way ISA hardware monitoring chips
are handled, so this code is likely to be gone in a near future anyway
(providing I can actually find the time to work on this... sigh). Things
should be much clearer after that.
Thanks,
