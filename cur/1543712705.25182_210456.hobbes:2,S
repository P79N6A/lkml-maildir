OK, so why not compile the cmpxchg instruction even on i386 targets
to let generic kernels stay compatible with everything, but disable
ACPI at boot if the processor does not feature cmpxchg ? This could
be helpful for boot/install kernels which try to support a wide
range of platforms, and may need ACPI to correctly enable interrupts
on others.
