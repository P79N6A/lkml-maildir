Alas, no.  gcc is amazingly (and inconsistently) sloppy about the
things it accepts as integer constant expressions.

It's not about externs.  It's about things like
unsigned n;
int a[] = {[n - n + n - n] = 1};
And yes, gcc does eat that.  With -pedantic -std=c99, at that.  
However, 
unsigned n;
int a[] = {[n + n - n - n] = 1};
gets you error: nonconstant array index in initializer
And that's 4.1, not 3.x...
