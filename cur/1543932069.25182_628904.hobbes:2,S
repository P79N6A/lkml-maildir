it seems like you are mixing your use cases and arguing reasons for one 
when answering questions about another.
if you are talking network connections between virtual systems, then the 
exiting tap interfaces would seem to do everything you are looking for. 
you can add them to bridges, route between them, filter traffic between 
them (at whatever layer you want with netfilter), use multicast, etc as 
you would any real interface.
if, however, you are talking about non-network communications (your 
example of sending raw video frames across the interface), and want 
multiple processes to receive them, this sounds like exactly the thing 
that splice was designed to do, distribute data to multiple recipiants 
simultaniously and efficiantly.
I think you need to seperate out these two use cases (and any others you 
are advocating this for) and argue each one on it's own.

for a new family to be valuble, you need to show what it does that isn't 
available in existing families.

I'm not familiar enough with ptrace vs utrace to know this argument. but I 
haven't heard any of the virtualization people complaining about the 
existing interfaces. They seem to have been happily useing them for a 
number of years.
