Understood.

This is the way that I use PRCS now and it fits the diff/patch model
for distributing kernel code that most people are used to, while
reducing the concerns about information overload.
With PRCS I have branches galore with lots of little changes.  The
outside world sees complete patch sets, not the individual changes.
When they send a patch back I work out which internal change it is
against and start a new branch against it.  The downside with PRCS is
that the creation of the patch set and storing on an ftp site is a
manual process, as is identifying which internal change a patch
response is against and starting a new branch against the last internal
change.
If bk could automate the creation and tracking of meta patchsets I
would convert tomorrow, the ability to automatically distribute changes
is what I miss in PRCS.  But if using bk means that I cannot
automatically separate and track the internal and external patches then
there is no benefit to me in converting.  If I have to clone a
repository to roll up internal patches into an external set and I
cannot automatically pull changes against the external set back into my
working repository then bk gives me no advantages.
