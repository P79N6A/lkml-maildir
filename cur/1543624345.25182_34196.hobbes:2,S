I suppose this patch
http://cvs.samba.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/rsync/zlib/infblock.c.diff?r1=text&tr1=1.2&r2=text&tr2=1.6&f=u
i closer to what I need. It seems most vendors have only patched ppp's zlib
implementation (drivers/net/zlib.c). I couldn't find that particular patch
in redhat update kernel .src.rpm, tough. I guess I'll have to apply the zlib
diff by hand.
