Lesson #1 of firewalling: drop everything.
Lesson #2 of firewalling: only accept what you absolutely have to.
Try pointing a web browser at sgi.com port 80.  I _bet_ you get a
response.  The site is reachable, they just block UDP (and probably
a lot of other stuff.)
traceroute uses UDP, so if a site drops UDP (rather than blocking it)
it will appear as a black hole.
