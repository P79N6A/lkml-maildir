Today might not be a "smart day" for me, so perhaps I'm just not doing
what's need to trigger this, or I'm misreading (but if you can trigger
it, w/ Amit's patches in CVS and my 1/2 from yesterday and then my 7
from today, I'd be grateful) but UP and SMP on a UP box both have
KGDB_CONSOLE behaving correctly.
