True.
I checked against SunOS, Solaris (2.4-2.6), linux-2.0.3X, Irix-<something> and
hpux-<something> when 2.1.124 was new.
AFAIK from other persons' reports, Cygwin32/NT, FreeBSD and Next also report error
messages.

May-be, I don't know what POSIX says about "rmdir" or rmdir().
However, the new behaviour of "rmdir" seems arkward to me: After excuting the
command sequence above you can still "ls" in <somedir>, but "ls .." doesn't show
<somedir>, bash's command prompt also reports to be still in <somedir>.
I reported this to egcs-bugs in Oct 98 but didn't get any response (I've just
checked the egcs-bugs archive, but my mail seems to be corrupted in the archive).

Are you sure? I don't have access to *BSD systems, therefore I don't have an
opportunity to check it myself. Until now I've read bug reports related to the
egcs/gcc/fixincludes problem for linux > 2.1.124 only - Not having read about
FreeBSD makes me wonder.
May-be it's not a "rmdir()" problem but a "rmdir"-problem (fileutils-3.16).

I know - I was using ext2, if that matters.

Cf. the patch below (The patch I use to work around this problem) - egcs-1.1.1 also
is affected.

I am not a linux-kernel hacker nor an egcs-developer, nor am I knowledgeable enough
to judge, so won't I argue for this.
This time "Linux has changed its (probably undocumented) behaviour, which has
always worked in the past :-" (no flames, please - I want this problem to be fixed,
either in the kernel or in egcs/gcc/fixincludes)
