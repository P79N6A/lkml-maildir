Perhaps to comply with the ISO-9660/ECMA-119 standard for CD-ROM file systems? 
ISO 9660/ECMA-119 requires file names to contain only 0-9, uppercase A-Z, 
underscore, a single dot ("."), and a single semicolon (";")[1].  For details, 
see section 7.5.1 of ECMA-119:
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm
[1] One can use various techniques to create file names that contain additional 
characters within a valid ISO 9660 file system.  However, these file names may 
not be accessible on all operating systems.
