Hi,
I have tested the pmac32_defconfig, make menuconfig , and there's some warnings:
.config:380:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
.config:808:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol IEEE1394_OUI_DB
.config:811:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol IEEE1394_EXPORT_FULL_AP
I
.config:1308:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol BACKLIGHT_DEVICE
.config:1310:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol LCD_DEVICE
.config:1461:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol USB_BANDWIDTH
.config:1464:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol USB_MULTITHREAD_PROBE
.config:1476:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol USB_OHCI_BIG_ENDIAN
.config:1734:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol ZISOFS_FS
.config:1894:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol IOMAP_COPY
.config:1920:warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol DEBUG_RWSEMS
Then I modified the config file, But still can't boot , just stopped,
and the keyboard is active,  it seems the kernel is running, but
there's no init messages.
I don't know why, the distribution I used is Yellowdog 4.0. the
original 2.6.17 is just ok.
Could you please help to check the configs?
Thanks.
