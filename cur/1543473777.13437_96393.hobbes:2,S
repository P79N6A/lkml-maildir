It doesn't work for the Gravis PnP.  I have to init with commercial
OSS and then load ALSA.
I'd really like to see them support the SB Live card, as I'm looking
for a decent alternative to my ISA bus Gravis card, but few can
match it.

This is a very important point.  I hope they get it right because
that is the main reason I use OSS.

No, it lacks functionality still.  Maybe if it was made the standard
driver it would get more people working on it, I don't know.
