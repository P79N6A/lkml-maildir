Hi,
I am willing to contribute to the development of Linux
kernel. I googled a bit and found that I should join
the list and then I can go ahead.
I would like to know.
1. What are the features currently being worked upon?
2. Are there any things-to-do lists maintained?
3. How are new features selected?
4. Can I suggest new features?
Thanks.
