I think it's time that I take a look at the fusyn code. I don't have all
the emails on this thread, could you point out to me where I can see the
latest fusyn patch. Thanks.

It's getting late where I am, and I'm getting tired, so I'm a little
slow right now.  Is what you are showing me here what is currently in
fusyn or a proposal with the merging of Ingo's rt_mutex?   Reason why
I'm asking, is what's the difference between the owner here and in
fuqueue's spin_lock?

This above structure would represent the user space wrapper structure
that I meant with the fusyn structure containing the rt_mutex lock.
Right?

Would the above spinlock_t be a raw_spinlock_t? This goes back to my
first question. I'm not sure how familiar you are with Ingo's work, but
he has turned all spinlocks into mutexes, and when you really need an
original spinlock, you declare it with raw_spinlock_t.  
Also in the above, is the fuqueue_ops the ops we mentioned earlier as
the links into PI?
Sorry about being totally ignorant here, but it's the end of the day for
me, and I'm starting to feel burnt out.
Thanks,
