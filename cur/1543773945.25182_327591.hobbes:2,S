Tell me about it :)
I'll look at the warnings and try to clean them up myself, if that's ok 
with you, since I'm in the middle of changing that code anyway.
The reason for the unsigned nature of those tokens is that after 
compression they really do hold "binary data" and not "text", so I 
wanted to keep that clear by using unsigned chars.
Anyway, thanks for the gcc4.0 output. Since I don't have a gcc4.0 
installed yet, I can use it to fix these issues and post a patch ASAP.
