Thanks.  I want to hold off on taking these just a little bit longer.

With the omap clk implementation in a state of flux, hopefully moving
towards something which better reflects the intentions of the clk API,
passing clk names around becomes entirely wasteful and unnecessary.
That's not to say that what you currently have won't work with the patches
as they currently stand - it will work as is.  I'd just rather avoid
having to have a separate patch to convert this code as well.
