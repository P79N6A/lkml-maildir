A kernel panic happens whenever it finds itself in a situation which is
impossible or impractical to fix.  In your case, it needed the SCSI module
in order to load the root FS.  But the SCSI module is itself located on the
root FS.  Catch 22, so panic.  If you'd read the module documentation,
you'd have known about this beforehand, but chalk this up to experience
(aka. RTFM!).
So, a kernel panic usually means it's a configuration error OR hardware
failure OR (rarely) a kernel bug.  Most often, kernel bugs are marked by an
OOPS or BUG message splashing all over the console and the system log.
