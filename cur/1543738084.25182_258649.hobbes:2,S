Nah, that's OK.  I can drop the old patch and pick up the new.
It's only when code is settling down into a final state that I get upset
about wholesale replacements.  Even then I'll just feed it through

__FUNCTION__ is preferred, actually.  Just for consistency, and so the
compiler will spit it out if someone tries to do compile-time string
