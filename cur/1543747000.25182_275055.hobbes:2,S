Small cleanups for ide-tape.
Patch 1:
-----
The patch removes a bunch of unnessesary parantheses from return
statements. There are tons of return statements that look like this: 
return (-EIO);   return (fn());  etc. 
The patch removes these unneeded parentheses.
The patch also removes a lot of spaces from function declarations. There 
is some inconsistency in the file, some functions are declared as  
  void fn() { }
and some as
  void fn () { }
So, the patch changes them to all use a common style. I picked the 
  void fn() { }
form, since (a) it seems to be the most common form used in the kernel as 
a whole, (b) it is the form used in Documentation/CodingStyle, and (c) it 
is the form that reduces the filesize a bit :)
Patch 2 (cut on top of Patch 1): 
-----
This patch ensures that copy_to|from_user() return values get checked and 
dealt with by returning -EFAULT if they fail. Aside from the fact that we 
really want to handle these failures, this patch also silences these 
warnings: 
drivers/ide/ide-tape.c: In function `idetape_copy_stage_from_user': 
drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2613: warning: ignoring return value of `copy_from_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result 
drivers/ide/ide-tape.c: In function `idetape_copy_stage_to_user': 
drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2640: warning: ignoring return value of `copy_to_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
Please review these patches. I don't have the hardware to actually test 
them myself. All I have been able to do is compile test them and try to 
convince myself that they are OK by reading the code.
