The format is actually a public format. There is a gimp-plugin for it (see
www.gimp.org; the plugins-section). Beeing a somewhat "native" gimp file, 
what more does one want ? I agree that it is a requirement for open source 
that at least one common paint-program can read/convert the current image.
