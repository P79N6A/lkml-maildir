Can you please do
# echo test > /sys/power/disk
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
(the system should freeze tasks, suspend devices, disable nonboot CPUs,
wait for 5 seconds, enable nonboot CPUs, resume devices, thaw tasks and return
to your command prompt) and see if you can reproduce the problem?
Greetings,
Rafael
