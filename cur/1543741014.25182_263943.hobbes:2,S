Subject: [PATCH 1/3] RCU: rcu_assign_pointer() removal of memory barriers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/23/241

This patch adds the rcu_assign_pointer() API that helps reduce the
need for explicit memory barriers in code that uses RCU.  This API
buries the required memory barriers in a macro that also does the
assignment.  This has been tested successfully on i386 and ppc64.
