Sorry - I was thinking vmtruncate(). truncate_inode_pages() would
result in all the mmapped pages becoming out-of-date anonymous
memory.  NFS needs to take down the pagetables so that processes
which are mmapping the file which changed on the server will take
a major fault and read a fresh copy.  I believe.
