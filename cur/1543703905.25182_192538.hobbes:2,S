There is one fundemental braino in the discussion.
Only HALF the bits are for preventing "accidental" collisions. (The
"birthday" thing). The rest is for preventing to "brute force" an input
that produces the same MD5.(*)
So MD5 has only 2**64 Bits against accidental collsions
Btw. I already had (a/the) MD5 collision(*2) in my life.
So you'd need SHA256 or SHA512 to be "really sure(tm)".
*: AFAIR i read this in the specs of SHA1 (160 bits). So i guess this is
also true for MD5.
*2: I had a direcory of about 1,5 Million images and "md5sum"med them to
eliminate doubles. The Log-file, at one point, had the same md5sum as
one of the pictures.
