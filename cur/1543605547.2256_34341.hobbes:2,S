ahah, I had quite a few problems getting framebuffer, dri
and all to work on each kernel that I overlooked that.
With the linux 2.4.12 I cant seem to get dri to compile
for instance.
drivers/char/drm/drm.o: In function `ffb_vm_shm_nopage':
drivers/char/drm/drm.o(.text+0x4ba8): undefined reference to
`virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map'

`virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
The main annoiance is the 3.5mb size limitation
which one reaches quite quickly.
ow well, I am gonna trow a some time at the 3ware driver
to see how long it'll take before I give up trying to get
it to work on sparc64 ;).
So long and give the penguin some fish.
