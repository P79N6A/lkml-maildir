In fact, he -must not- ack it. Because is the HW is really down (in D3),
got knows what accessing the ACK register will do. I can give you
ideas... from nothing on most x86 desktops to machine checks on most
powerpc machines, though I could imagine some cards bad enough to lock
your bus up if you try to access a register while they are in D3 (I've
seen some of those critters and it seems not all bridges timeout on
cards that just keep sending retries).
Cheers,
Ben.
