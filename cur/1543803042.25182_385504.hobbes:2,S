OK, I'm actually sending you this email on a x86_64 running
2.6.15-rt4-sr2, with latency tracing on.  But unfortunately, I have a
AMD X2 that each core has it's own tsc counter that is not in sync, and
since the latency tracer uses tsc, I get garbage.  But beware, the tsc
does slow down when the cpu idles, so it gives bad results even for non
x2 systems.
I finally was able to boot this with using the PM timer, but the
beginning of my dmesg is still filled with:
read_tsc: ACK! TSC went backward! Unsynced TSCs?
Have you tried booting with idle=poll? I wonder if that would help?
