The count is the number of free transaction labels (1394 async is
transaction-based) and is initialized to 64.  When a new transaction label
is needed, the requestor does a down(), then locks the tlabel variables
and allocates a new one.  When a transaction label is freed, an up()
occurs.  The semaphore's up() count is therefore the number of free
tlabels, and the number of outstanding transactions is (64 - count).  I
can imagine situations in which this would be a useful statistic, but
I'm not sure any of them actually exist.
I haven't investigated xfs, but modifying 1394 would be fairly easy.  I
could add a second variable that tracks the up() count, or just drop the
sysfs attribute that reports the number.  The first option seems a bit
wasteful, but only slightly.  I thought this patch was worthwhile based
on xfs wanting to do this and 3 arches already having (unused)
implementations of sem_getcount/sema_count.
If this patch isn't accepted, we should get rid of the xfs and 1394
hacks and delete sem_getcount (parisc, frv) and sema_count (arm) as they
are unused.
