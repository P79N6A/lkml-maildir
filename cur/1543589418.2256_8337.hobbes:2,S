Does anyone have, or know where I can get a copy of the above ?
The onboard AC97 sound driver (via82cxxx_audio) was rewritten from legacy
(which works both in UP and SMP kernels), to do w/o the legacy support,
and go native. The problem is that the new driver doesn't properly handle
enabling interrupts for the case when the IRQ has been reassigned (by
the I/O APIC, which is typical under SMP). (actually the via82cxxx_audio
has code to try to handle the reassignment of the IRQ, but it doesn't work).
I'm looking to see a copy of the datasheet on the 82C686, to see if I can
debug this further.
thx for any pointers, and rgds,
-Greg
