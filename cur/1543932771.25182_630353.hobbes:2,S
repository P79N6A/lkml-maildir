In RT Kernel we have :-
RT Tasks and Non-RT tasks.
So we can also support :-
RT softirq-threads/IRQs and non-RT softirq-threads/IRQs
So RT softirq-threads/IRQs for RT Tasks
and non-RT softirq-threads/IRQs for non-RT Tasks.
OR also remove Non-RT tasks from RT Kernel and simply decrease the RT
priority of less important task as per your suggestions.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
