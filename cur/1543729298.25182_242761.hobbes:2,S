Hi Everybody,
since quite a while no I'm unable to use any input-channels on my SB Audigy.
Alsamixer shows any channel I'm used to see, but I'm unable to toggle the
Capture facility on any channel I consider to be input.
On kmixer it's the same, there's not even one channel on the tab
"Eingang" (aka Input).
# modinfo snd_emu10k1 | grep vermagic

# lspci -v -d 1102:0004
