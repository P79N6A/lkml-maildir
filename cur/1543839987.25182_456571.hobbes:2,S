yes. taking lock is a probem.
I know current readdir() uses 8192 bytes buffer for getdents64(). Then,
maybe write-lock will be acquired all-tgids/400+ times for inserting token
(in 32bit system).

Sorry, could you explain more ?

Ah, I should add lseek handler for proc root. Okay.

yes. it has several good points and simple.
My patch's point is just using task_list if we can, because it exists for keeping
all tasks(tgids).

please post again. I think comparing the two is good.
I will post take3 with improved comments and lseek handler, and so on.
