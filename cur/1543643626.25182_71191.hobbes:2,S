Couple questions/comments.
- Is this the same summit code as is in 2.4-ac ?
  (Ie, the one that boots on non summit systems too)
- I believe the way forward here is to work with James Bottomley,
  who has a nice abstraction of the areas your patch touches for
  his Voyager sub-architecture.
  Linus has however been completley silent on the x86-subarch idea
  despite heavyweights like Alan and Ingo adding their support...
  If you go this route, James' base needs to go in first
  (converting just the in-kernel visws support). After which, adding
  support for Voyager, Summit and any other wacky x86esque hardware
  is a simple non-intrusive patch that touches subarch specific areas.
- Some of the code you've added looks along the lines of..
   if (numaq)
      foo();
   else if (summit)
      foo2();
   else 
      foo3();
  Would it be over-abstracting to have some form of APIC struct,
  defining pointers to various routines instead of lots of ugly
  if's/switches/fall-through's.
However, the last point may be completley pointless after adapting to
use what James B has come up with..
