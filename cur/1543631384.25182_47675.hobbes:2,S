Hello, I tried with kernels 2.5.16, 2.5.15 and 2.4.18 with a ide cdburner:
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
   Vendor: SAMSUNG   Model: CD-R/RW SW-208B   Rev: BS03
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
with cdrecord --version
Cdrecord 1.11a19 (i586-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Jörg Schilling
but it's a 1.11a21, and a 2x200mmx 96Mb. and the results were rather disapointing:
- 2.5.15 & 2.5.16 both hung my machine the moment cdrecord tried to write.
- 2.4.18 wrote ok, until 702MB, then a scsi stopped the procces, detailed log of 
the cdrecord session follows:

cdrecord: fifo was 0 times empty and 11261 times full, min fill was 98%.
Note that this was a traxdata 90' silver cd, in the instructions they said that 
it will be detected as a 80' and that you should enable overburnung, cdrecord 
without options said that -overburn should be active, this session is with 
-overburn active.
I don't have more 90' cd to try. I only managed to get one.
