md5sum has now been running in a loop for some 22 hours and completed  
11 sums of the drive (md5summing 400 gigs takes a little while). the  
md5sum is identical for each test,  and the syslog has no error  
indications. Then, starting harddisk stresstest, I get this error  
again after about an hour testing:
Nov  3 11:33:17 ganske kernel: EXT3-fs error (device sda1):  
ext3_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block =

...
So, error only occurs on filesystem usage, not with direct  
blockdevice access.
Any ideas?
