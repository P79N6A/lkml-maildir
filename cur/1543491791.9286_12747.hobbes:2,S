2.0.x I assume.

Either: patch 2.0.x to ignore suid-root or mount filesystems with the
nosuid option if you really don't want to trust suid-root binaries.
That of course can leave you with a crippled system (unless you only
log in as root), but then again so does putting capabilities in
ext2fs, since all your binaries which require capabilites will now no
longer run.
I suppose a compromise would be to have / mounted with suid allowed
but all other filesystems nosuid.
