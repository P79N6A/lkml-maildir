	In linux-2.3.24, include/net/irda_device.h no longer defines
struct irda_device (it is eliminated, not moved).  The core code in
net/irda appears to have been updated to reflect this, but the drivers
in drivers/net/irda apparently have not yet been updated, and,
consequently, do not compile.  If updating these drivers is on
the communal TODO list, that's fine; but, if this is a case of an
incomplete patch, I thought I should point it out.
