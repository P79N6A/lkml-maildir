Yes, except it can't be done like this for xpmem.

See the last patch I posted to Andrew, you've probably looked at the
old patches, the old patches didn't work for GRU and didn't work for
xpmem and they weren't optimized to cluster the invalidates for each
4k-large-pte.

I kept improving my patch in case the VM maintainers would consider
xpmem requirements not workable from a linux-VM point of view, and
they preferred to have something obviously safe, strightforward and
non intrusive, despite it doesn't support the only sleeping user out
there I know of (xpmem). My patch supports KVM and GRU (and any other
not sleeping user).

There's some xpmem code posted but the posted one isn't using the mmu
notifiers yet. GRU code may be available from Jack. I only know for
sure their requirements in terms of mmu notifiers.
