I do it purposely.  Go read:
 
http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/
and read through the (flash) bits.  Now consider "are email addresses
information which can be used to identify individuals?"  The answer is
"yes".  Are we storing that in a kind of database?  Yes.  Therefore,
does this fall under the terms of the Data Protection Act?  Yes.
Therefore I myself do not want to store peoples email addresses BK,
thereby avoiding this issue entirely.
