my point is that 0 as align must not round to l2 size or you break
stuff. you likely have broken the vma alignment to make the most obvious
example because I don't think it's a l1 cache multiple.
Removing the HW_ALIGN bitflag isn't nearly enough to avoid breaking
stuff after your changes to the kmem_cache_create API, to avoid breaking
stuff you need to change _all_ other kmem_cache_create and replace 0
with 4 if they didn't have the HW_ALIGN parameter, you didn't do that
and things breaks, not just for small objects, but for the ones bigger
than the cachesize too.
If you fixup all other kmem_cache_create callers to pass 4 instead of 0
that could be fine with me, but I still think this removal of the
HW_ALIGN bitflag is completely worthless, you still have a branch
checking !align, so you don't seem to gain anything and you break stuff.
Note: I really appreciate the runtime evaluation of the cachesize, those
parts are fine, changing offset to "align" is also more than welcome,
only the removal of HW_ALIGN bitflag w/o s/0/4/ where HW_ALIGN was
missing is bogus and breaks stuff.
