There is a difference between $(CC) and $(HOSTCC).  We have both of
them for a reason.  $(CC) specifies the compiler used to build the
kernel - it may or may not be your regular system compiler.  It can
even be for another architecture - for example, it may produce PowerPC
object files from the comfort (?) of your x86 PC.
$(HOSTCC) is specifically to build executables that are to run *on* the
build system itself - kconfig, for example.  If you're running on x86
and building a PowerPC kernel, you need an x86 version of kconfig, not
a PowerPC version.
So $(CC) *must* be a gcc (or a convincing facsimile) - but $(HOSTCC)
can be *any* C compiler on your system.  I don't think anyone tries to
use any gcc extensions with $(HOSTCC).

Not very likely, but you take a lot for granted.  On many combinations
of Unix + gcc versions, `gcc -shared' doesn't work until you spend half
a day hand-tweaking the specs file whilst poring over the obscure flags
section of the `ld' manpage.  Try it for gcc 2.95 on AIX sometime, for
a bit of good clean fun.
My point was and is that while shared libraries are a (relative!)
breeze on Linux, they have always been a horrible portability headache;
furthermore, the kernel build system doesn't need them and ought to do
without.
