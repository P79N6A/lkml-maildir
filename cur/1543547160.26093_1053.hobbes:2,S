I didn't write the SMBUS code (the author is not on this list),
however, the basic SMBUS work was based off here:
  
http://www.netroedge.com/
%7elm78/
At this point we've only tried/tested/looked_at GX chipset based SMP
MBs.  Loosely we hit the chipset and get the specs for every
individual memory card, and look for something that looks like one
of our devices as per the SPDs (we have a mini in-driver
eeprom-style client setup to get the SPDs).  The cards are then
identified as per a signature in the SPD.
