Yes, it is. But: (a) It's vulnerable to overflows (two deep trees, move
one to the top of other, then back to original, then the same with roles
exchanged). I.e. it's not an invariant, only semi-invariant. Another thing
being locking and here we may end deep in it.
	Moreover, it makes innocent, normal rename O(number of children) +
O(number of children) operation instead of O(1) + O(depth) (IO + RAM
accesses, that is).

It's *almost* the same problem, except that with the newsfeed you don't
have connectedness and stuff arrives in random order.
