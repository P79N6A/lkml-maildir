Check out this line in the base level makefile:
ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed -e s/i.86/i386/ -e s/sun4u/sparc64/ -e
s/arm.*/arm/ -e s/sa110/arm/)
This actually looks broken for cross-compile, but I haven't been
following the changes particularly closely...try using this instead:
ARCH := mips
Really, though if you're compiling for mips you should probably grab the
mips-linux CVS sources here:
 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs login
   (Only needed the first time you use anonymous CVS, the password is
"cvs")
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs co <repository>
There's a 2.4 tagged branch that's probably closer to what you want. You
can ask for mips-specific on linux-mips@oss.sgi.com, and you'll be much
more likely to get a prompt and useful answer.
