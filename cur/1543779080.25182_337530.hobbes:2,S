This patch was sent first time very long time ago, 
but magically was disapeared, it probably exists
in your queue, but to be sure, I resend it.
If can not be applied cleanly after your w1 queue is flushed
into upstrem tree, just drop it.
Thanks.
Patch from Michael Farmbauer <michl@baldrian.franken.de>.
