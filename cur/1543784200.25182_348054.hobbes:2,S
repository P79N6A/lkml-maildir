I realize the theory behind breaking up locks, I'm just wondering about
this specific case. Please show actual contention data promoting this
specific case, we don't break up locks "just because".
I'm asking because I've never heard anyone complain about IDE lock
contention and a proper patch usually comes with analysis of why it is
needed.
