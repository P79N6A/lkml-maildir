OK I've sent you a patch to do that.

Yes I did. I will continue to look into this.

My thinking is to go by number of pages. Then you get to tell the
shrinker: we scanned this many pages of LRU, so please scan an
equivalent percentage of slab *pages*.
You can then translate this to number of slab objects before scanning.
Oh, apart from that, there is still one thing that I'm not sure is
correct about slab scanning... we scan slab in response to scanning
a part of the inactive list, but we apply this pressure as if it
were a ratio of active + inactive lists.
This will cause slab to be scanned less, but my main worry is that
it makes slab scanning behaviour dependant on the ratio of active to
inactive list size: the bigger your active list, the less slab will
be scanned which I think is silly. But I might be wrong.

I agree. I'm much more interested in getting light and medium swapping
working better.
