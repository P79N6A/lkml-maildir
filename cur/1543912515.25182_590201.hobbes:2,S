> I am having trouble sending these patches.  When I look in the LKML.org message archive, I see "=A0" and "=20" in the messages.  I am using KMail to send these, I have wordwrap turned off and am inserting the patch file.  Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?
It seems that you have some 8-bit characters in the email.
The '=20' in the middle of the patch was stripped for me by sendmail,
apparently, but you can see the character before your name in the
'Signed-off-by' line.
Maybe try mutt?
