Never seen anything like that here? 2.2.0pre6, and I've got all the
codepages as modules, currently loaded are:
[root@sleipnir perl5.005_54]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
nls_iso8859-1           2020   1  (autoclean)
nls_cp437               3548   1  (autoclean)
vfat                   12892   1  (autoclean)
fat                    23584   1  (autoclean) [vfat]
I see accented (and other assorted Latin-1) characters fine on the
console. Spanish keyboard, loadkeys 0.96.
