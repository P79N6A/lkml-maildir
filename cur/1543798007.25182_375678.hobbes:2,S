Okay already. What is it that it doesn't do that you expect it to do?

So what is it that the socket doesn't do, that you expect it
should do?

What is it that you expect it to do? Networking exists at several
levels. You may have to use setsockopt() to set some socket parameters
for some kinds of sockets. The 'fact' that something worked in
some previous code does not mean that the code was correct.
