Kernel version 2.4.1 through 17 (last I checked 17) used a bunch of
ways including the keyboard controller, the aux control port, then
finaly a transition to 16-bit address space with direct execution
of the reset vector. I found that the only reason the transition
to 16-bits "worked" was because of coding errors which caused the
processor reset.
Therefore, I created a deliberate "coding error" which actually
doesn't require fetching random instructions. The processor never
even gets to fetch anything because a CS selector for the correct
segment has never been loaded. It can't fetch instructions and,
in fact a logic analyzer shows that the last memory access was
the dword load of the trash CR0 instructions plus some additional
cache-line fill of valid code.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
