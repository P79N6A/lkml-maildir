Yes, that would work too and would look much nicer.
I think we should change the reset program check handler, so that it searches
the exception tables. At least for in-kernel addresses that should work.
For addresses within modules this might cause deadlocks, since the module
code takes spinlocks and we are in a context where we just killed all cpus
not knowing what they executed... Hmm..
