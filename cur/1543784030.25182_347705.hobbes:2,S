You can't make this work.  First of all, the other WinXP clients would
be completely unable to decrypt your packets, because they don't have
the right key.  Secondly, the kernel cannot know what the destination
is until *after* it has decrypted the packet, because the real target
address is encrypted along with the rest of the data for security.  If
your OpenSwan box is too slow, get a faster OpenSwan box, don't try to
break the encryption to make it faster.  You cannot remove enough
encryption features to get the required extra speed without disabling
the encryption entirely.
