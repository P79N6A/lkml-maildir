With namespaces there are secondary issues with unsharing.  Weird things
like a simple unshare might allow you to replace /etc/shadow and thus
mess up a suid root application.
Once people have worked through those secondary issues unsharing of
namespaces is likely allowable (for someone without CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
Although if you pick the truly hierarchical namespaces the pid
namespace unsharing will simply give you a parent of the current
namespace.
For resource controls I expect unsharing is likely to be like the pid
namespace.  You might allow it but if you do you are forced to be a
child and possible there will be hierarchy depth restrictions.
Assuming you can implement hierarchical accounting without to much
expense.
