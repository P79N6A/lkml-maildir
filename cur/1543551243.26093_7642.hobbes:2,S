that's why you have per process limits set. Eg, PAM makes this
exceedingly easy with pam_limit.so -> edit /etc/security/limit.conf.
this prevents at least 90% of OOM situations (ie individual leaky
processes). eg netscape will then pop-up "can not allocate memory"
messages and stop rendering pages instead of crashing your system.
