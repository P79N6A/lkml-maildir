Try these two litter things in Assembler code:
#define LONG_MACRO	\
asm			\
#ifdef something	\
asm			\
#else			\
asm			\
asm			\
#endif			\
asm
Compiles just fine with all 3.x I've tried.
	jump	92f
	...
81:	...
	...
92	...
Again, compiles just fine.
Both are clearly wrong and should not be in the source code.  But
Assembler bugs are subtle, nasty and Code Checkers for Assembler are
rare.  My vote is to keep 2.95+ support.
