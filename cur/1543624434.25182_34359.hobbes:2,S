Thinks I could think of, which produce a large amount are iptables logs, audit
messages and network debug logs like rejected packets, discarded packages due
to checksum failures, route changes, interface changes, etc.
Of course it is only useful if it is not another framework because this will
lead to kernel clutter. So do we want to replace netlink and printk?
