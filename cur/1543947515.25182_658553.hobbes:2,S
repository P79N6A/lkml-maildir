Hi Peter, Sam,
could you take a look on x86/boot/header.S:280 please?
# Zero the bss
	movw	$__bss_start, %di
	movw	$_end+3, %cx
	xorl	%eax, %eax
	subw	%di, %cx
	shrw	$2, %cx
	rep; stosl
I wonder why is $_end there instead of $__bss_stop?
Well, accroding to vmlinux_32.lsd both _end and __bss_stop
are the same BUT __bss_stop is more convenient methink.
Would it be usefull to change?
