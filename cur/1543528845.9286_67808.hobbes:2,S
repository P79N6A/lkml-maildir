Bandwidth reclamation is turned off, but I am using JE's UHCI.  My
system seems ok, it's just the modem connection that's slow.
The TCP session is very conditional.  Press a key, wait 5 seconds for
display update.  Here are some ping times.  It could be my ISP today, or

I only noticed since I went from 2.3.40 to 2.3.49 recently.
