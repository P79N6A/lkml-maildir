whupping ext3's butt on write performance isn't very hard, really ;)
But it should be done based on "feature equivalency".  By default,
ext3 uses ordered data writes.  Data is written to disk before
the metadata to which that data refers is committed to journal.
It would be questionable to compare a metadata-only journalling
approach to ext3 with data=journal or data=ordered.
