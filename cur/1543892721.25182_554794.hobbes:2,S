Eh, the kernel choses both shmid and tmpfs inode number.
You could set a high bit in one or the other.

On the bright side, this only screws up people who get the
crazy idea that processes can be migrated.

It's mandatory for a different reason: to satisfy parsers.
It is nearly useless for identifying shm files. Look what I can do:
    touch /SYSV00000000
    touch '/SYSV00000000 (deleted)'
(so pmap creates a shm, looks for the address in /proc/self/maps,
determines the device major/minor in use, and then uses that)

Piggybacking on tmpfs has always seemed a bit dirty to me.
