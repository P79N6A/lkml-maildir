It's good manners, but ultimately users vote with their feet.
If codebase A requires that modifications be given back (GPL v2), and 
codebase A' additionally requires embedded device makers to permit users 
to use modified code in all cases, which do you think device makers -- 
and ultimately users -- will choose?
For a lot of kernel devs who voted, I got the sense that the DRM clause 
was the big stopping point.  I actually think the patent clauses might 
help things a bit, providing the "convey" language is cleared up.  But 
the DRM clause is far from technology-neutral, and doesn't take into 
account useful DRM.
DRM is just a technology.  It's not good or evil.  It's a bit like 
bittorrent:  arguably, the majority of BT usage is for copyright 
violations, but there are good uses for it too.
Further, the GPL v3 gets _too specific_ when it comes to talking about 
technological remedies.  It gets into the same trouble that politicians 
get into, when they write technological remedies into law.  Technology 
changes too rapidly to get specific.  Pretty soon you'll find that a 
useful scenario was outlawed.
