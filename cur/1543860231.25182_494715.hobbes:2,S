Hi,
personally I don't like the new code; memset only takes a byte as
argument and while it probably is the same, that is now implicit
behavior and no longer explicit. A reasonably good compiler will notice
it's the same and generate the best code anyway, so I would really
really suggest to go for the best readable code, which imo is the
original code.
