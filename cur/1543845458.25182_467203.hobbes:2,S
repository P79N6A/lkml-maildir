I forgot to note this in patch #1, so this comment applies to both patch 
#1 and patch #2:
ata_id_is_sata() is probably not the check you want.  This tests Word 93 
of IDENTIFY DEVICE output, which is a check that's not in the ATA 
specification, but rather something I came up with.  It will indicate 
false for ATA devices that attach via SATA cables, but have a PATA 
bridge chip soldered onto the ATA device.
A better test is probably "ap->cbl == ATA_CBL_SATA".

Remove the export, this is for exporting symbols to export kernel 
modules, not for making symbols visible at the C level, to other C modules.
