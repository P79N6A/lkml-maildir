hipocrite.
You're spouting nonsense.  User to user means

You have angry fingers (one of my problems).   You don't need a user
context switch for kernel paths in a NOS kernel.  In NetWare, user
context switches are done in gates in the GDT with TSS descriptors, not
in kernel fast paths with LAN I/O, which isn't what I was talking about.
