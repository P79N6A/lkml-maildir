yeah.

nmi_exit() has no hw effects - it's just our own bookeeping.
the hw knows that we finished the NMI when we do an iret. Perhaps that's 
the bug or side-effect that made the difference: via enabling irqs we 
get an irq entry, and that does an iret and clears the NMI nested state 
- allowing the kexec context to proceed? I suspect kexec() will do an 
iret eventually (at minimum in the booted up kernel's context) - all 
NMIs are blocked up to that point and maybe the APIC doesnt really like 
being frobbed in that state? In any case, the local_irq_enable() is just 
wrong - it's the worst thing a crashing kernel can do. Perhaps doing an 
intentional iret with a prepared stack-let that just restores to 
still-irqs-off state and jumps to the next instruction could 'exit' the 
NMI context without really having to exit it in the kernel code flow?
