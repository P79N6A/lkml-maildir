Yeah. Note that in this particular case I could use EX_TABLE() macro
too (if it is defined for x86, I can't verify yet).

Good idea.

Ok, I will have a look inside.

Oops, I forgot it one more time.
That reminds me: I don't know why I always confuse the name of this
tracer: function-branch-tracer instead of function-graph-tracer.
Weird :-)

Thanks :-)
