OK, here's a real world example, taken straight from the linux-audio-dev
list today.

The program use poll to sleep. If the resolution of the kernel is 100Hz,
there would sometimes be a too long delay of up to 10ms (and probably beyond)
before the program is woken up,  and before a midi message is sent,
which can cause music to stutter.
Simple as that. :-)

Hmm, mplayer I guess...
Don't know how muse, rosegarden, seq24 etc. handles timing...
But all midi-sequencers that doesn't use /dev/rtc could suffer. (?)
