I'm not sure whether that's actually correct, but as long as there's a
mixture of ALSA and non-ALSA drivers in 2.6, they really ought to
have the same behaviour in this regard.
I.e. if silence is the load-time setting, the OSS drivers and other
non-ALSA sound drivers should be changed to do that as well.
