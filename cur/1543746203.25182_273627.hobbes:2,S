Ok, having looked at the bugzilla entry, I have to concur. Looks like we 
do need to disable the PCI interrupts and re-enable them. Mea culpa.
So what's the right way to get ELCR into a useful state? I'm starting to
lean towards your "just clear it all" after all, but that does the wrong
thing for SCI (which is _usually_ level-triggered), and I worry that there
are other cases too.
Any reasonably simple patch that likely gets it right?
