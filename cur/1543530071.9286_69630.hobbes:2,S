Err, ...
not, there is no reason i should not be able to change mode of Xfree-fbdev
whit fbset, not sure it will work, but still that is xfree who is broken.
But anyway, i don't agree with you, there is no reason that a lots of people
can open /dev/fb in read only mode, sure if some guys want to write to it at
the same time, it could cause problems, ...
