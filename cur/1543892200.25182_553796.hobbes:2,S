I might be a little late in the discussion, but I somehow missed this
before.  Please don't add this xip support to cramfs, because the
whole point of cramfs is to be a simple _compressed_ filesystem,
and we really don't want to add more complexity to it.  Please
use something like the existing ext2 xip mode instead of add support
to romfs using the generic filemap methods.
