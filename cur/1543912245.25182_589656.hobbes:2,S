Subject: [PATCH] local_t Documentation update 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

local_t Documentation update 2
Grant Grundler was asking for more detail about correct usage of local atomic
operations and suggested adding the resulting summary to local_ops.txt.
"Please add a bit more detail. If DaveM is correct (he normally is), then
there must be limits on how the local_t can be used in the kernel process
and interrupt contexts. I'd like those rules spelled out very clearly
since it's easy to get wrong and tracking down such a bug is quite painful."
It applies on top of 2.6.23-rc3-mm1.

+* Rules to follow when using local atomic operations
+
+- Variables touched by local ops must be per cpu variables.
+- _Only_ the CPU owner of these variables must write to them.
+- This CPU can use local ops from any context (process, irq, softirq, nmi, ...)
+  to update its local_t variables.
+- Preemption (or interrupts) must be disabled when using local ops in
+  process context to   make sure the process won't be migrated to a
+  different CPU between getting the per-cpu variable and doing the
+  actual local op.
+- When using local ops in interrupt context, no special care must be
+  taken on a mainline kernel, since they will run on the local CPU with
+  preemption already disabled. I suggest, however, to explicitly
+  disable preemption anyway to make sure it will still work correctly on
+  -rt kernels.
+- Reading the local cpu variable will provide the current copy of the
+  variable.
+- Reads of these variables can be done from any CPU, because updates to
+  "long", aligned, variables are always atomic. Since no memory
+  synchronization is done by the writer CPU, an outdated copy of the
+  variable can be read when reading some _other_ cpu's variables.
