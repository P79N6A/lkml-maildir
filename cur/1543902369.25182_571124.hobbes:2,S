specifically:
"3.239 Nice Value
  A number used as advice to the system to alter process scheduling.
  Numerically smaller values give a process additional preference when
  scheduling a process to run. Numerically larger values reduce the
  preference and make a process less likely to run. Typically, a process
  with a smaller nice value runs to completion more quickly than an
  equivalent process with a higher nice value. The symbol {NZERO}
  specifies the default nice value of the system."
The only expectation is that a process with a lower nice level gets more
time. Any other expectation is a bug.
