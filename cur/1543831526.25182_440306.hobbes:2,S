No, not really.  According to Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class all
code that uses /sys/class/foo/ needs to be able to handle the fact that
those entries might be symlinks and not just directories.  Everything
that I know of already works properly because the input layer has had
symlinks in /sys/class/input for quite some time now.
Do you know of any tools that use /sys/class/net/ that can not handle
symlinks there?  I've been running this on my boxes for about a week now
with no noticeable issues.  Renaming interfaces works just fine too.
thanks,
