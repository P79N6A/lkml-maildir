Thanks, Thomas, for your patch. It works well for me (ASUS V6V).
There is only one thing I want to remark: Since the most recent BIOS
ASUS changed the behaviour of the touchpad LED, it is inverted now.
Until now I got around this in userspace (adapting the handler script).
But with the new led class it seems to me, we will have to deal with
that in the kernel module.
My suggestion is a new flag (tled_inv) which has to be set for every
model (always use most recent BIOS). What do you think about this?
Greetings, Johannes
