It's probably because of struct dirent definition used by readdir().  It
may differ depending on archs and glibc version but IIRC the backend
implementation of all directory listing functions in glibc were the
same.  It opens with O_LARGEFILE and use getdents64 to get full info
then clip it to whatever limit the called API imposes.
