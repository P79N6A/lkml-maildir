Don't patch the kernel. If init gets the controlling tty, and you
press ^C -> SIGINT gets sent to init -> init interprets this as
ctrl-alt-del ! Yes, choosing SIGINT as the signal sent to init on
ctrl-alt-del was probably not very bright (and it was my idea.. sorry)
but there's nothing we can do about it now.
I'm already working on 2.79 and this section has already gotten
a complete overhaul.
Mike.
