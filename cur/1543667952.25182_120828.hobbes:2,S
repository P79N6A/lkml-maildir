PAGE_SIZE is 4KB. I have 2 questions:

Build it for one of those architectures that actually have 8k pages, and
run on that sort of machine.  Nobody has made a 8k page linux
for i386 or other 4k-page architectures.  It is possible, but a lot
of work because the cpu don't support it.

 From man mke2fs:
mke2fs -b 8192 /dev/disc...
Of course you won't be able to mount it on a machine with 4k pages.
