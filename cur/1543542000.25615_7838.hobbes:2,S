I think there is value in having everything under drivers/...  With
drivers/<bus>, we can already cover most of the architecture-specific
bits. Maybe just a few more bus types are needed - e.g. many "system on
a chip" design families have some tiny little bus and all the devices
there are rather unique and may have a lot of shared resources.
On the other hand, drivers/<function> makes sense for generic drivers
(e.g. drivers/char/mem.c) and those supporting many buses. So perhaps a
chipset that is used on many platforms should be split into the bus
interfaces in drivers/<bus> and the portable part in drivers/<fn> ?
This would probably require include/drivers or such, to avoid
cluttering include/linux with tons of additional "internal" files.
Also, drivers/<bus> should probably be reserved for drivers for the bus
itself, with the device drivers in drivers/<bus>/<fn>, or drivers/pci
would look a little nasty ;-)
Furthermore, if a driver starts is existence in drivers/<bus>, and then
turns out to be useful on other buses too, it would have to be split.
This would be a departure from the current implicit assumption that you
pick "The Right Place" once and forever. It would also make it harder
to port somebody else's driver to a second bus. But it would limit code
replication.
Does this sound reasonable ?
