As it seems you don't understand, let me explain: this is definitely not an 
anti Linux Blog but rather a reply to the anti Solaris article of a pro 
Linux Bigot who calls himself a writer....

removing a comment that is not a personal infringement? As you seem to think
about this posibility, let me ask: should we be rather afraid of you?
