Hi!
Again, quite a bunch of patches has accumulated in my tree - now that
they're well tested through Andrew's mm tree, I'd like to merge them to
you.
There still are imperfections in atkbd/psmouse locking, but the races
are rather hard to hit - and it's still better than before. They should
be fixed in the next round of patches, however I'd still like to have
this round of patches in before the next one.
