I have to admit I haven't *hit* a sleep problem specific to Ingo's code, unless
you have a different config/hardware and my BKL wierdness and your sleep are
2 different manifestations of the same problem.  Or maybe they're 2 different
bugs... ;)
I'm running Ingo's patch and the nvidia 6629 drivers as I'm typing this. Given
you had to fool with pgd_offset_k and friends, you're probably trying an older
driver (6111?) and should upgrade - the 6629 picked up a *bunch* of 2.6-related
fixes.  Maybe 6629 fixed your sleep issue?
I needed to make 1 small patch to the nvidia code to support the 4-level
page table code in -mm, and one small kernel patch from Zander at NVidia to work
around another issue.  Both attached.  You apparently already have the GPL-export
fix.  If you're not running Ingo's patch, you'll need the non-NVidia-related
patch to fix the ioctl-cleanup.patch breakage (Ingo rolled that one into -RT),
but if you got it to come up at all in -rc3-mm1, you have that one too (but those
of you playing along at home will need it)...
Modulo those patches, the only thing I've hit since 2.6.10-rc1-mm1 or so is
this BKL strangeness, and that only bites me in -RT with one configuration...
YMMV, binary modules are evil, Works For Me with 6629 on my Dell laptop, and
all that. If this isn't enough to get it working for you, your best bet is
probably to wander over to
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=14
and see if Zander has new words of wisdom (that's where I found the VM-IO patch).
