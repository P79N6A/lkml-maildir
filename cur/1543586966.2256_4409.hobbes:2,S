I used 5000ms. I still freeze up with 2.4.3 + 6.1.10.
Unfortunately i could not see any messages and nothing got logged.
This time an fsck allowed me to boot back to 2.4.1.  
The visible symptoms were the same as before (2.4.3 + 6.1.8) but this time I was
unable to flip virtual consoles before the freeze so I dont even
know 100% what is causing it - it boots fine - and the scsi driver 
makes no complaints - it all looks normal. X starts up and I can login. 
it starts ok and windows start popping up -  shortly thereafter it freezes 
- just like before. 
I will try investigate further and see if I can get any more log messages.
Is there any debug boot option or compile flag that will help me find out more 
what is going on?  
/var/log/messages says this about scsi.
