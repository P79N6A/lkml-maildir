Well, this is what I initially argued with willy...
I think typical usage will be:
  o dri fires off hotplug event
  o userland card POSTing tool reads the ROM, saving it off for future use,
    and POSTs the card
  o userland tool calls back into dri saying that the card is ready
  o dri driver operates happily
So dealing with users accessing the rom file after a driver is up and running 
may not be worth the trouble.
