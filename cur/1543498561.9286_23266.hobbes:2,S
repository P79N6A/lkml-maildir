If I understand you correctly, you are getting an error message in
syslog about wrong kernel version.  If so, this is caused by klogd
which looks for the current System.map so it can convert Oops addresses
into module offsets.  Unfortunately klogd only looks in 3 places (man
klogd and search for map), it certainly does not know about /dboot.
I recommend that you tell klogd not to look for the map.  Find where
klogd is started (probably /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog, under label start)
and add -x.  Mine says "daemon klogd -x".
To get better Oops decoding, use ksymoops.  It lets *you* say where
your maps and modules are instead of assuming, although it does have
default values.
