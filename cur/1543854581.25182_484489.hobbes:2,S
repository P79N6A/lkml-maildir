Hi all,
       I am using fedora core -3 with kernel 2.6.10. I want to 
read/write a sector from/to the HD with out kernel caching. Basically my 
aim is to communicate directly with the ide drivers so that I can bypass 
the kernel cache. Please give some idea regarding this.
Regards
Dipti Ranjan Tarai
