As I understand it you want this new driver to replace the one in the 
kernel, correct?
If so, would it be possible to rename the output file to megaraid.o, 
instead of megaraid_nm.o. The reason for this is that then the various 
vendor tools that produce initrd images would then most likely not need 
to be changed.
If not, then a new name is good ;-)
Cheers,
Paul
