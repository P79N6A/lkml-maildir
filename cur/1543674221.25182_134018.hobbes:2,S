Yes, of course.  Not a good idea to write an email in a hurry.

What could you possibly do about a timer with an unknown drift?
Perhaps give preference to higher frequency, even if the drift is
unknown?  In any case, I suppose we can fine-tune the policy
afterwards.
Andrew, I assume it's OK with you if I update the ia64 code to the
proposed interface and then send you an updated patch?
