They do the same thing for the x86_64 ia32-compat and x86_64 native vDSOs,
respectively. 
Subject: [PATCH 1/2] x86_64 ia32 vDSO: install unstripped copies on disk
Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86_64 vDSO: install unstripped copies on disk
Andrew called them
x86_64-ia32-vdso-install-unstripped-copies-on-disk
x86_64-vdso-install-unstripped-copies-on-disk
The names/subjects are not identical, but differ in having "ia32" or not.
That is really the only difference between the two patches, too.

I don't now what is unclear about the log entry.  Yes, each log entry says
the same thing after the first (Subject) line.  Each one relates to a
different arch/x86_64/subdirectory/Makefile that creates vDSO images.
Prepend "This applies to the x86_64/vdso native vDSO building." or
"This applies to the x86_64/ia32 vDSO building." to the log if you prefer.
Thanks,
Roland
