This patch destroys the entire value of the module license system
unfortunately. I can put any code I like under a BSD license and not
give you the source and claim it is BSD licensed. I don't have to give
you the source, you can't demand it so anyone can claim that and it
would allow arbitary code without taint. Not good at all.
For code which is GPL licensed in the kernel but has other licenses
we have the tag "GPL and additional rights". This allows us to cover
licenses that are GPL compatible and where the GPL version of the rights
is in use in the kernel.
