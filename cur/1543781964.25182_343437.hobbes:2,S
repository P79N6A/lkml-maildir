Hi folks,
At boot time my Logitech mouse is detected as
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=0001 Version=0000
N: Name="PS/2 Generic Mouse"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio1/input0
H: Handlers=event1 ts0 mouse0
B: EV=7
B: KEY=70000 0 0 0 0
B: REL=3
After manually reloading psmouse I get the expected
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=0002 Version=0049
N: Name="PS2++ Logitech Mouse"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio1/input0
H: Handlers=event1 ts0 mouse0
B: EV=7
B: KEY=f0000 0 0 0 0
B: REL=3
Using psmouse_noext=1 at boot time does not help.
How comes that this doesn't work on the first run?
I asked this more than a year ago, and somebody posted
a fix, but obviously it wasn't accepted.
What needs to be done to fix this?
Regards
Harri
