Yes it could, but i dont even want to thi nk about all the issues of
doing such an interface. It is basically an microkernelish approach.
I prefer monolithic simplicity.
e.g. i am pretty sure your user space implementation would be far
more complicated than a nicely streamlined kernel implementation. 
And I am really not a friend of unnecessary complexity. In the end
complexity hurts you, no matter if it is in ring 3 or ring 0.
