Hi all.
Now that feature freeze is just around the corner I would like to ask 
you if we will get support for packet writing in the 2.6/3.0 kernel. It 
would be especialy nice to have support for Mount Rainier which enables 
easy use of CD-RWs and that would help people (especially newbies) that 
use CD-RWs a lot.
There are some patches from Jens Axboe that are available here:
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/patches/packet/2.5/
Are patches these OK for this or would support have to be completely 
rewriten?
Thanks in advance for any information about this important feature for 
many people.

Live long and prosper!
