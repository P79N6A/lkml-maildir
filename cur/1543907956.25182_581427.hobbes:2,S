 That is why I added the 16 bits entry point support (selected by default),
my target with Gujin was not only to load Linux but also another simpler
format - gzip'ed ELF 32/64 files with real-mode embedded at address 0 .
 I also had to show that it was possible to write the Linux-real-mode
code in C with GCC so that someone else would do it and maintain it.
 I may (in few version) remove Gujin code which fills Linux zero-page
structure if the 16 bit entry point works in all cases (mostly in DOS
which help me to create a DBG debug file to sort out Gujin/BIOS problems
remotely).
 I may maintain another patch to produce this gzip'ed ELF32/64 for Linux
as an example of how to use that Gujin interface, but that is not really
related. That patch is in Gujin Sourceforge download.
 Note that I call (instead of jump to) the 16 bits entry point so that
this "function" can return to the bootloader if it detects a problem.
 Etienne.
