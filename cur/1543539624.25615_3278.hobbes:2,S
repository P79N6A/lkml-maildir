Yes there are immutable files. Anyhow, You might want to boot from cdrom
or similar, since those physically can't be written to.

There is this guide line "what you don't need, disable". Following this,
you might in end up with a somewhat usable and somewhat secure system. In
this particular case, if you are running a firewall, you'd disable module
loading, raw io etc so that the possible can physically harm the box even
if he gets in. This may mean half and hour vs. couple of days down time in
your organisations net access if you don't have a backup fw box, but you
have a backup of the fw software floppy (which you'd have to update, since
it has the same security problem as the original).
