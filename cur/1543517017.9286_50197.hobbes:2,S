That would make sense if its race related. The common theme on almost every
report I've looked at that ran out of memory mysteriously is 
a) no process limits set
b) netscape
There are a couple of exceptions but not reliable ones. Patches are accepted
if/when you find the bug.

I build 2.2.x with every driver I don't have as a module before I even release
it. Arjan van de Ven runs random choice compile sequences and contributes
patches to the odd ones that fail. You might want to ask Arjan for his
randomiser and load test your PIII boxes with it.
