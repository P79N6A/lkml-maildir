At Sequent, we found that there are a small set of processes which are
"critical" to the system's operation in that they should not be killed
on swap shortage, memory shortage, etc.  This included things like init,
potentially inetd, the swapper, page daemon, clusters heartbeat daemon,
and generally any core system service which had a user process component.
If there wasn't enough memory for those processes, or if those processes
weren't already responsible in their use of memory/resources, you were
already toast.
Anyway, there is/was an API in PTX to say (either from in-kernel or through
some user machinations) "I Am a System Process".  Turns on a bit in the
proc struct (task struct) that made it exempt from death from a variety
of sources, e.g. OOM, generic user signals, portions of system shutdown,
etc.
Then, the code looking for things to kill simply skips those that are
intelligently marked, taking most of the decision making/policy making
out of the scheduler/memory manager.
