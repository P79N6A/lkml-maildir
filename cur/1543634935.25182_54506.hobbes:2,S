It's feasible, but a downright pita.

Well, for 2.4 I'd be inclined to just add the extra field to 
struct buffer_head and be done with it.
Current sizeof(buffer_head) is 96 bytes, and making that 100 would
be a nuisance, but its quite easy to shrink the buffer_head a
bit (replace b_inode with BH_inode, say...).
