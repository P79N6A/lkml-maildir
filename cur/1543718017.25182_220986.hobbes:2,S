Thanks, it has been on my todo for a while.
A few comments though.

Please get rid of makeboot. Use $(Q)$(MAKE) ... instead.
Hereby the '+' sign is no longer needed (used today where makeboot is used.

Please use $(Q)$(MAKE), so command is expanded with make V=1, and
to make it look like all other usages.

OK.
But this file in general looks strange. There seems to be no way
to descend into arch-v10?
Mikael - any pending patches for this file / architecture?
Mathieu, could you please update the patch and send onwards to Andrew.
Do not touch the cris Makefile more than you did, the maintainer needs
to clean it up.
Thanks,
	Sam
