Hi all!
I'm currently working with Linux in a hardware virtualization
environment (L4 microkernel). During tests, we discovered, that there is
some incosistency in the kernel configuration dependencies:
the file "drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c" is added to the kernel as soon
as PCI support is activated, even if USB support is completely disabled.
We discovered this issue while trying to run multiple Linux instances
simultaneously.
Is there a special need, that the "drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c" is
compiled into the kernel even if USB support is disabled?
I suggest the attached patch to resolve that problem. The file then is
only included if PCI and USB support is enabled.
Best regards,
Oskar.
