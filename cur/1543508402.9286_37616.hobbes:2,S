This is the reason I chose to have the relative block numbers be an
option.  However, I'm not sure how much the security is improved by
having absolute block numbers. The following is the attack I'm basing
my assumptions on.  There are probably other attacks that I am unaware
of though:
Some TLA agency wants to break Linux ext2 file-systems.  They know
each file-system start with a common header.  Thus, they encrypt the
starting block of a linux file-system with 2^n different keys and put
them in a large table [ n is the number of bits in the cipher's key].
Then, to crack a file-system, they simply look up the first block of
the loop-device in their precalculated array and get the key.
But the above attack can be circumvented by using a cipher with a
longer key.  If you use a 128-bit key and the entropy of your
passphrase is indeed 128 bit, then building the table above seems to
require _a lot_ of disk-space, even if they can do certain
optimizations that only require them to store 2^90 or so blocks.
Regarding the increased security given by using the absolute block
number I think that in some cases it is very low.  For instance in the
case where you use a whole partition, chances are that you have
partitioned your HD on a MB boundary or a cylinder boundary.  With
some statistics I doubt the block number gives you more than 10bits of
random data.  For a file it might be more but to me it still seems
that increasing the key-length of the cipher you're using is a lot
easier than not being able to take backup of your encrypted files.

Do you know of other attacks than the one mentioned above?
