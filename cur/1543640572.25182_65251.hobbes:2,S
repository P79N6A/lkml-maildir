Which kernel tree are you looking at? I'm looking at 2.4.20-pre4. In
there, I see this code in fs/block_dev:do_open():
	if (!bdev->bd_op)
		bdev->bd_op = get_blkfops(MAJOR(dev));
	if (bdev->bd_op) {
		ret = 0;
		if (bdev->bd_op->owner)
			__MOD_INC_USE_COUNT(bdev->bd_op->owner);
		if (bdev->bd_op->open)
			ret = bdev->bd_op->open(inode, file);
		if (!ret) {
			bdev->bd_openers++;
			bdev->bd_inode->i_size = blkdev_size(dev);
			bdev->bd_inode->i_blkbits = blksize_bits(block_size(dev));
		} else {
			if (bdev->bd_op->owner)
				__MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT(bdev->bd_op->owner);
			if (!bdev->bd_openers)
				bdev->bd_op = NULL;
		}
	}
So if bdev->bd_op has been set (either by devfs_open() or by the
return from get_blkfops()), the module refcount is incremented.

Because it's an optimsation, avoiding the need for looking up ops from
tables/lists. It's the sensible way of doing it. I've explained this
to others on the list, and in the FAQ. I'm not going to keep going
over it again and again.
