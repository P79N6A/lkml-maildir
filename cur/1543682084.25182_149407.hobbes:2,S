I don't understand. Did you introduce some float? Remove it immediately.
You just replace
        lba = (ideinfo->capacity / (ideinfo->head*ideinfo->sect));
        lba = lba * (ideinfo->head*ideinfo->sect);
        lba = lba - ideinfo->sect;
by
	lba = ideinfo->capacity - 63;
Then everything works for you, I suppose.
Subsequently we wait for other people with the same hardware
and see how the 63 varies as a function of their setup.
(Or maybe you can go into the BIOS and specify different
translations yourself?)
(By the way, didnt your boot parameters lead to ideinfo->head = 16
and ideinfo->sect = 63?)
