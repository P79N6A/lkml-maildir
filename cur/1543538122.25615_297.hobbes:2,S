Hi,
I have gone trough my collected data and found that
the best yet (non latency patched) is
  test1-ac22-riel++
It works perfectly for streaming read/write/copy
(latencies to SCHED_FIFO process below 5 ms !)
but fails for mmap002 with latencies > 180 ms
test1-ac22-riel++ consists of:
* Linus......... linux-2.4.0-test1
* Alan Cox...... linux-2.4.0test1-ac22-riel
* Rik van Riel.. mail sent to linux-kernel and
  linux-mm with a subject of "[PATCH] -ac22-riel++"
