So no kerberos.
I just rebuilt the shadow suite (where my login comes from) to be on the
safe side.  But the problem is still there.
ldd login shows:
        libshadow.so.0 => /lib/libshadow.so.0 (0x4001a000)
        libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x40033000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40060000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
I'm running glibc-2.2, but this problem also existed in 2.1.x (which I had
installed when I went to the 2.3 kernels that exposed this problem).
