iwlib.h (or any other userspace app) must not include <linux/*> and 
<asm/*> files. If it needs access to them for accessing ioctl API
(or anything else), maintainer must create stripped-down copy of
these headers, and distribute them with app - which is btw only
correct way, as otherwise you cannot create userspace app which
will support more than one API version (and iw used couple
of incompatible APIs in the past...).
