Please note: for those who are interested in trying this out, a patch
for the 'mount' program in util-linux-2.11r is available on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/NFSv4/mount-2.11r-nfsv4.patch
Note however that the NFS client is not yet fully functional, as it
lacks the upcall + RPCSEC_GSS. These features are forthcoming...
Cheers,
  Trond
