Subject: [PATCH] New driver 3Com 3C359 Tokenring Velocity XL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
The driver for the 3c359 adapter has been tested in the wild for several
months now and ready for inclusion in the kernel.
The patch itself is fairly large due to the microcode required for the
adapter, so links provided rather than including in this email.
2.4.17:
plain: 
http://www.linuxtr.net/download/3com/3c359-2.4.17.patch
gzip:

2.5.5pre1
plain:

gzip: 
http://www.linuxtr.net/download/3com/3c359-2.5.5pre1.patch.gz
The only difference between the 2.4.17 and 2.5.5pre1 patch is the part
for the Configure.help / Config.help files.
Thanks to 3Com for providing the tech docs for the adapter and to all the
beta testers for the driver.
Thanks
