Lustre definitely wants to be able to aggregate IOs into larger chunks
wherever possible.  Having interfaces that allow this instead of going
through page-at-a-time interfaces is definitely a win.  As it stands
now we have to avoid the VFS or otherwise have back-channel information
in order to ensure that large IOs remain large.
Cheers, Andreas
