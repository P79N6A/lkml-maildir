Andrea,
I doubt that it applies against -ac and I have only very few hard disk space,
so please don't beat me I could not try... (I tried the second-to-last but
it didn't apply either)
But 2.4.3-ac7 works very fine with your older patch.
As noticed, I now solved by CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK=y (as in i386)
by hand on i686.
Sorry
-mirabilos
