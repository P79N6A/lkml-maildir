Hi,
I presume you are using Pavel's server from his web page ? You need to increase
the buffer size that the server uses. This happens as a result of the change
a little while ago of nbd to use the elevator to merge requests at the nbd
client end. If memory serves the maximum size of request is sizeof(header) +
128 * block_size, so you need to alter the server to use that size.
You'll find the buffer size in the main loop of the mainloop() function
char buf[20480]; needs increasing (to (131072 + 28) for 1k blocks for example)
and also you'll need to increase the value here (to 131072 in this example):
                if (len > 10240)
                        err("Request too big!");
Then it should work fine.
Steve.
