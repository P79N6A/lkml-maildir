I've been hanging out for 2.4.19 to be released.  Then I hope to
submit some of the changes that recently went into 2.5 (which sort out
the locking) and then the partitioning.
I suspect the functionality will end up in 2.5 one day, but I'm not
sure how and I'm not going to push it until (unless) the block_dev
layer settles down.
