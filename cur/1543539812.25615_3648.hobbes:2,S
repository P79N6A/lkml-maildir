Hey Doug
You are not a default compile option are you?  Regardless, you were
specifically designed to throw the kitchen sink and the hardware, and that
is cool.  This is clear and nobody has done in their /etc/fstab
/dev/sga2       /                         ext2            defaults   1   1
/dev/sdg1       /boot                     ext2            defaults   1   2
/dev/sdg5       /usr                      ext2            defaults   1   2
Can this be done?
