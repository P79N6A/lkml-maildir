Great, then we are in violent agreement on the single abstraction. 
On the second part, I stand by my previous statements that threads or
processes should be used sparingly.
All I'm doing is trying to counter all the "threads are great" hype.
This is a pretty intelligent pile of people but there are also a fair
number of people who read this list looking for nuggets of information.
If they walk away going "(a) Linux has a cool threading model, and 
(b) I should only use threads if I absolutely have to do so and even
then if there are more than there are CPUs I'm probably making a 
mistake", if they get that message, that's a good thing, IMHO.
