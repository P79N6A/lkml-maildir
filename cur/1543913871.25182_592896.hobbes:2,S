Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Maple bus support for the SEGA Dreamcast
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hopefully these patches are now up to standard.
I have reworked the aica patch also, but I am not including it as I
seem to have the occasional deadlock problem.
I haven't been able to crash these patches without the sound driver
running, so I that seems to be where the issue is - the usual G2 bus
problems.
Following requests the bus driver now has a mutex to guard against a
rogue process adding to the waitq.
