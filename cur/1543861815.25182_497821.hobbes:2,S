Again, what about fibre channel support?  Imagine I have multiple blades
connected to a SAN.  For whatever reason I format the san w/ ext3 (I've
actually done this when we didn't need sharing, just needed a huge disk,
for instance for doing benchmarks where I needed a large data set that
was bigger than the 40GB disk that the blades came with).  I better not
touch that disk from any of the other blades.
All you are saying is unionfs should always make sure its data is sane,
never make assumptions about it being correct.
Put it this way, imagine I have an ext3 fs on a SAN, I can only use it
frm one machine.  Lets say I want to be smart and mount the FS read-only
from another machine,  should I have any expectation that it will work?
Nope.  
Now, under what conditions can one expect unionfs to work?  Basically,
where the underlying FS isn't being modified (though possible others).
Is that a reasonable condition.  I believe so.  If you disobey the
condition, the machine shouldn't oops, but it should detect it and tell
you and shut down usage of the FS.
