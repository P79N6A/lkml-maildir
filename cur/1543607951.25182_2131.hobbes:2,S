I preferred the previous exclusive_swap_page logic. It couldn't race
because we had the lock on the page, it's equivalent and it looked
cleaner and simpler to me, we had to bother about the rest only if the
page was exclusive.  Now this only_swap_user replaces the
exclusive_swap_cache check basically and you will end doing the double
of the work if the vm is full and the page isn't exclusive, so both
exclusive_swap_cache_delete and only_swap_user will have to work and
fail.

if we remove all write-swapins from the swap cache those pages cannot be
in flight, we cannot do I/O on anon memory if it's not in the swapcache
or we would race badly. all I/O to the swap space have to pass through
the swap cache to be safe. So I don't see how an anonymous page can be
in flight.

I think this is not true. remove_from_swap_cache can be run only if:
1) we hold the lock on the page
2) this mean all I/O is complete and so we can safely convert this
   non in-flight page to an anonymous page clean where any further
   I/O will be impossible
So I still think the only advantage is to keep the swap position
persistent across a swapin/swapout cycle.
