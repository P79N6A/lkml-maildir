Sorry about my cryptic late-night post.
i really should have attached this to the 32bit-uid thread.
'scap' seems like a well thought user-level encapsulation
of the existing linux kernel capability mechanisms.
I didn't mean by injecting a discussion of future kernel extensions,
to dissipate your zeal for the project of making user tools
for handling existing kernel-supported mechanisms.
The parallel with 'su' is a good one.
Note also Jeremy Fitzhardinge's work on annotating ELF executables
with a capability set, as a much finer grained version of the setuid bits.
The two are complementary, 'scap' is to 'su' as ELF-caps is to SUID.
Well, sort of -- see <
http://www.goop.org/~jeremy/caps>.
The worrying thing about making capabilities this accessible is that it
can lead to quick hacks using scap as a *tool*, which weaken system
integrity -- augmenting a process's capabilities make it a target
for cracking and spoofing from the unaugmented processes of the *same* uid.
I leapt upon the 32bit uid extension as a means to grant different
internal uids to different capability sets, thus breaking the relationship
of trust, and forcing same-public-uid processes with different
capability sets to go through some lengthier authentication process
before signalling/examining/meddling with each other.
But such complexity is against the spirit of linux...

not yet.
i was just waffling on possibilities.
i'll drag my original outburst back to the 32bit-uid thread
when i've added a little more meat/sleep to it.
