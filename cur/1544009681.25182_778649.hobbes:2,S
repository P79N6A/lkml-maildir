If it's about counter control for the monitored task, then we sure could 
do something about that. (apps/libraries could thus select a subset of 
functions to profile/measure, runtime, etc.)
If it's about counter control for the profiler/debugger, i'm not sure how 
useful that is - do you have a good usecase for it?
