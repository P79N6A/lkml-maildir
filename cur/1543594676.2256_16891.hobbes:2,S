What is the best way to install the modules? Is there a directory _all_ of
the modules exist in b4 you do "make modules_install". I usually end up
setting EXTRAVERSION to something unique and doing a make modules_install.
That way it does not hose up the modules for the build machine.
Is there a better way?
