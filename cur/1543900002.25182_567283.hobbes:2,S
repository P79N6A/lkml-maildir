Thanks for the quick reply. But I was wondering as to why I would have to map
the physical address to the virtual address when I know that the string is
permanently in the physical memory because its loaded into flash. Is there a way
to directly read from the physical memory location? Also, do the functions
ioremap() and readl(va) work when called from within a kernel module?
