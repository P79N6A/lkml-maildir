A very large percentage of Dell PowerEdge servers sold with Red Hat Linux,
or used with other distros, have 2 or more processors.  We today have
servers with 1, 2, 4, or 8 CPUs, and with the advent of HyperThreading, that
looks like even more.  More than two CPUs is not at all uncommon in the
server space.  Desktop/notebook space, sure.
Thanks,
Matt
