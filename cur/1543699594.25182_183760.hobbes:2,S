 Well, the NMI watchdog is a side-effect feature that works by chance
rather than by design.  So you can't really complain it doesn't work
somewhere, although I wouldn't mind if new hardware was designed such that
it works.  You shouldn't have to use "acpi=force" for the watchdog to work
though and for a PII system if "nmi_watchdog=1" doesn't work, then I
suspect a BIOS bug (set APIC_DEBUG to 1 in asm-i386/apic.h and send me the
bootstrap log and a dump from `mptable' for a diagnosis, if interested).

 Linux has all appropriate bits to set up hardware reasonably as long as
BIOS provides accurate information.  The only case our code fails is when
BIOS tells us lies and the there's little we can do about it.  Actually we
are doing hardware manufacturers a favor we try to handle some cases at
all -- it's the BIOS that should be fixed instead and it is software and
it is stored in Flash memories these days, so there's no excuse.  So if
there's a problem with running Linux because of BIOS bugs, then please
bugger the manufacturer in the first place (and avoid the company in the
future if they don't support Linux).
 Sometimes the NMI watchdog works in principle, but its activation leads
to system instability -- almost always this is a symptom of buggy SMM code
executed by the BIOS behind our back (NMIs are disabled by default in the
SMM, but careless code may enable them by accident).
