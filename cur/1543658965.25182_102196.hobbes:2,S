The lpr/lpq programs tell me /dev/lp0 "no such device", and catting a file
to the device fails. It looks as if the driver isn't listening to the lp0
major,minor or something.
As noted, all works fine in 2.4.{18,20} when booted.

I'd settle for a usable device, that isn't happening. I'd believe I need
to change config, but I'm at a loss for what.
