Hi Robert,
The following patch fixes an apparent mismerge of Andrew Morton's low
latency work into the lock breaking patch.  Without this fix,
journal_commit_transaction() will loop forever, without making
forward progress, if need_resched was set on entry.
Base to which the patch was derived:
    linux.2.4.18.tar.bz2
    + sched-O1-2.4.18-pre8-K3.patch
    + preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-rc1-ingo-K3-1.patch
    + lock-break-rml-2.4.18-1.patch
Regards,
Joe
