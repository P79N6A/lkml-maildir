No, it isn't swappable.  Neither is vmalloc()ed memory.  The only
swappable memory (i.e. either paged out to swap area or file) is mmap()ed
memory.  (mmap() isn't to be taken too literally, user space doesn't
call mmap() for most of its stuff, but the kernel does call it (or one
of the lower level primitives) for user allocated memory.)
