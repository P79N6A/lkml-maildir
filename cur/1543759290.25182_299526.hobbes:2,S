This is to announce that Herbert Xu is now taking over my role as
co-maintainer of the kernel crypto API.
I've not been able to devote enough time to the integration of
async/hardware support, and Herbert, who has been doing excellent work in
the networking code for some time, has now thankfully stepped up to help.
Hopefully things will now move forward more quickly in this area.
