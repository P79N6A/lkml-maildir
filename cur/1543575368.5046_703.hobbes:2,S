After doing some googling....
It would appear that, in Family 5, Model 8, Stepping 12 of the K6-2,
AMD used a different CPU core, that was more similar to the K6-3, and
that there is a slightly odd way of doing write-combining.
Perhaps this is the problem?
Anyone with more knowledge on the AMD cores care to comment?
