Why this can't be done by
  PATH=$CROSS_COMPILE:$PATH
in your environment?

If that matter, `type -path' is bashizm (BloAted SHell), and "blackbox"
with "dash" (very good `sh' equivalents) will fail. I would recomend to
use "which" command (btw, Debian has `sh' version of it), if you
concerned about size and performance.
Nack + proposition to move from `bash' to `sh'.
-MKIMAGE=$(type -path mkimage)
+MKIMAGE=$(type -path ${CROSS_COMPILE}mkimage)
 
 if [ -z "${MKIMAGE}" ]; then
-	# Doesn't exist
-	echo '"mkimage" command not found - U-Boot images will not be built' >&2
-	exit 0;
+	MKIMAGE=$(type -path mkimage)
+	if [ -z "${MKIMAGE}" ]; then
+		# Doesn't exist
+		echo '"mkimage" command not found - U-Boot images will not be built' >&2
+		exit 0;
+	fi
