so what - "uptime_read_proc" ignores the offset parameter anyway.
you get wrong results right now, too, even without the two lines
I've added.
if you write "Except that this is wrong" you should have in mind that
"this is wrong" currently, too.
just "try to advance the offset a bit from the start of the file and
read something", like "dd if=/proc/uptime bs=1 count=1 seek=1".
do you expect to get right results?
