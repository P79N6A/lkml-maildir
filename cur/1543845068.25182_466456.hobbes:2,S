Maybe, but it could be tricky to make that label visible to C code.

The "volatile" modifier for "asm" *only* means that the asm emitted if 
the code is reachable at all; it doesn't make any constraints about 
relative ordering of the various asm volatile statement with respect to 
each other, or with respect to other code.

Perhaps, though doing as much as possible visible to gcc has its 
benefits.  Tricky either way.

I don't understand.  Your asms put things into the marker section with 
".long A, B, C".  Does does that correspond to this structure?

i386 is about the only architecture which uses the stack for calls by 
default.
