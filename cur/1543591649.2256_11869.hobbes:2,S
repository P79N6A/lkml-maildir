Patch looks decent.  Adding module descriptions was quite nice.  One
flaw that is repeated multiple times is that you add
	#ifdef MODULE
	printk(version);
	#endif
in an ISA driver's probe routine.  This instead should always be the
first operation of init_module.
Also make sure to go through the 'ac' patch and review the earlier
version string changes.  Some of them were buggy, like
	static const char version[] __initdata =
	"...";
const combined with __[dev]initdata causes a section type conflict.  A
few of those popped up after the earlier patch was applied to 'ac'.
Finally, I don't know if I mentioned this earlier, but to be complete
and optimal, version strings should be a single variable 'version', such
that it can be passed directly to printk like
	printk(version);
Some net drivers are already like this, as I'm sure you know.  Some net
drivers have 'version', 'version2', 'version3' instead of just one long
string.  Some net drivers add KERN_xxx at printk time, instead of adding
it to the 'version' var.  Some net drivers do the following, which is
really silly considering you know all strings at compile time:
	printk(KERN_INFO "%s\n", version);
