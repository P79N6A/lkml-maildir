This was not a synthetic benchmark, I would consider this a 'real-world'
problem now.  Repeating the test with ext3 would just tell you whether
it has the same problem.
If it is neccesary to get the reiserfs issue addressed, I will repeat
the test with an ext3 system in the next few days,  I would like to hear
from reiser on this before doing much more.

This goes back to the need for ALSA documentation.  Someone needs to
write some.  This will probably require paying that person.  Hopefully
SuSe is working on this, though I suspect I would have heard something.
