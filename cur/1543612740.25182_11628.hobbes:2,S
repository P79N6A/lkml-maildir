I'm just wondering what would be the best way to get/set chipset
registers (for tweaking purposes) in linux.  What is the proper way to
address these things given bit numbers and offsets?
I'm a decent coder, I've done low-level hardware stuff before, but I
just don't know where to start with this.
Thanks,
Chris
