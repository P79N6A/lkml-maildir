I suppose you can simplify your interface when the code tracking the lock 
holder (i.e. the address of the lock call) is there: 
#define MUST_HOLD(lock)		BUG_ON(!(lock)->holder)
is independent of whether lock is a spinlock or an rw_lock, so you
don't need MUST_HOLD_READ anymore. I'd even go as far as dropping 
MUST_HOLD_WRITE as well, since it helps only in the corner case
where the lock is held but only for reading.
