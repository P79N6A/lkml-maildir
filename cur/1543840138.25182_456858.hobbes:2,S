That's pretty much the answer I was suspecting.  Sounds like the read
is doing some sort of flush.  Unfortunately I can't find any docs, so
I'd rather keep things as close to the old code as possible to avoid
breaking other cards.  Does something like this also work?
	udelay(500); /* Paranoia - phy_read() may be sufficient */
	if (phy_read(db->ioaddr, db->phy_addr, 0, db->chip_id) & 0x8000)
		printk("some useful error message");
