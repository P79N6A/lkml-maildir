Greetings,
I have a Compaq Evo n600c laptop, which has Intel ICH3 IDE onboard as well as 
CMD646 IDE on my docking station.  I have been runing 2.5.1 just fine for a 
while. Today I tried 2.5.3-pre4 and I bomb on boot.
The IDE part of dmesg from 2.5.1 says:
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ICH3: IDE controller on PCI slot 00:1f.1
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
ICH3: chipset revision 1
ICH3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x5068-0x506f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio

ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
on 2.5.3-pre4, undocked, it says:
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ICH3: IDE controller on PCI slot 00:1f.1
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
