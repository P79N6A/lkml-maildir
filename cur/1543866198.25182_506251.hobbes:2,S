Actually, on further inspection, it looks like the real issue is the
"path" name generation; "cat /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe" yields a call to
security_genfs_sid() with just "/modprobe" rather than the expected
"/sys/kernel/modprobe".  Which likewise leaves us with the generic proc
label, just as with the inode permission check, so I end up seeing
checks against it only.
