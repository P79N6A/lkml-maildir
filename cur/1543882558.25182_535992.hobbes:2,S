Nah, just teaching user-space to behave themselves should be sufficient;
there is just no way kicker can justify doing a fdatasync(), I mean,
come on its just showing a friggin menu. I have always wondered why that
thing was so damn slow, like it needs to fetch stuff like that from all
four corners of disk, feh!
Just sliding over a sub-menu can take more than a second; I mean, it
_really_ is just faster to just start things from your favourite shell.
No way is globally disabling fsync() a good thing. I guess Andrew just
is a sucker for punishment :-)
