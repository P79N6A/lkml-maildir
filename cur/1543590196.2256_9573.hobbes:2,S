Lorenzo,
Have you ruled out hardware failures? There's been a few isolated reports
about tape drives returning good status on write, where in fact they were
writing corrupt data. This can happen when the compression hardware is
malfunctioning. On many tape drives, read-back check isn't carried all the
way back to the original (uncompressed) data.
