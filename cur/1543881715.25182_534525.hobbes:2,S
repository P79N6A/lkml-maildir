Overall, maybe the 100 Mbps vs 1000 Mbps distinction is getting less
useful and it would be better to have a single list.  There are a *lot*
of chipsets on the market now which have the same core and the only
difference is that one has a 100M PHY and the other has a 1000M PHY.
For example, there are 100M versions of sky2 and r8169.
