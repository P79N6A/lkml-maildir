Yes, you better.  If you want the kernel to do a little extra for you,
you need to remember to tell it that.

Let me try this a different way.  The only valid boot targets on ppc32
are:
- zImage (which is what all does)
- znetboot (zImage + copy to /tftpboot/)
- uImage (U-Boot'ify a kernel)
wrt the last one, I'm torn between making it something that always
happens, since it's just so easy, and if it fails, we can just not care
about it (||true it, or something) or just not worry about it, since if
you're using U-Boot most likely you've already flashed it on, and know
what you're doing).
The "pick the right target" mojo done to ppc32 is like doing it on i386,
it's not a good example of what'll be cleaned up.  Same, so it seems,
with ARM.  WRT MIPS, I've pointed Ralf at the thread, and he should
speak up soon, I hope :)
