I'm with Tom on this. Don't apply this one. Additionally in the ppc64 camp we
like our ppc brothern have been sticking with zImage. It seems (least to me)
that it's reasonably documented in ppc and ppc64 circles. Perhaps tho it would
be appropriate to add a short little blurb in the  README for the various
architectures.
