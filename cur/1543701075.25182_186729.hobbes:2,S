I get good results from last night's PS2 mouse patches.  My one
problem machine now works perfectly again without the psmouse_noext
parameter I've been using for several months.
Two observations:
I see no deprecation warnings when starting the kernel with
psmouse_noext, which I was expecting to see.
The mouse is announced as a 'generic wheel mouse', but it is
really a Kensington Orbit trackball.  Unfortunately I don't
have a wheel mouse to test with, so I can't comment there.
Thanks for the fixes!
