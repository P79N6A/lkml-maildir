I think we're talking about a different meaning of "id" here... you seem
to be talking about the vfsmount pointer, whereas it was originally
proposed as mnt_sb->sb_dev.  Both are useful, for different reasons of
course.
We should include mnt_devname as well.
People are a bit nervous about exposing kernel pointers in userspace, I
have noticed; would it be better to add a "mnt_id" field to struct
vfsmount; this can simply be a counter assigned when the structure is
assigned and then never changed (it might have to be a 64-bit counter,
but I don't think that adding 8 bytes to struct vfsmount should be a
huge deal.)
Does that service everyone's needs?
