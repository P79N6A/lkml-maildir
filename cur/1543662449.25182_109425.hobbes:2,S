I'll try in a few minutes. It doesn't always do it in 2.5, just like
once every dozen or so captures.  NIC is a 3com 3c905C-TX/TX-M [Tornado]
in the client, and an Intel 82801BA/BAM/CA/CAM in the server, both
boxes connected through a cheapo 100MB switch. Nothing special.

That did seem odd yes.  I put it down to a tcpdump bug.
But if you think thats whats triggering it...

Wacky. Interested netdev parties can find the ~2MB tcpdump output at
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/cruft/tcp-trond.bz2
(please don't hammer that server with requests for this unless you
 really do want/need it - the mind boggles at how many hits the nfs
 fsx dumps got in the past -- I'm sure we don't have *that* many
 interested NFS developers 8-).

This is a 2.4.21pre3 server.  No non-linux servers to try against
right now..
