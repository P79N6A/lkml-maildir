The underlying internal implementation of something like this wouldn't be all 
that hard on many filesystems, but it's the interface that's the problem.  The 
':' character is a perfectly legal filename character, so doing it that way 
would break things.  I think NetApp more or less got the interface right by 
putting a .snapshot directory in each directory, with time-versioned 
subdirectories each containing snapshots of that directory's contents at those 
points in time.  It keeps the backups under the same hierarchy as the original 
files, to avoid permissions headaches, it's accessible over NFS without 
modifying the client at all, and it's hidden just enough to make it hard for 
users to do something stupid.
If you want to do something like this (and it's generally not a bad idea), make 
sure you do it in a way that's not going to change the behavior seen by existing 
applications, and that is accessible to unmodified remote clients.  Hidden 
.snapshot directories are one way, a parallel /backup filesystem could be 
another, whatever.  If you break existing apps, I won't touch it with a ten foot 
pole.
