wait_event_interruptible() will sleep until your ISR wakes it up, but
for your thread to run, you also need to make sure that the condition
being tested by wait_event_interruptible() is true (otherwise it will
go back to sleep).  For example, if your thread does:
	wait_event_interruptible(&my_wait, work != 0);
then your ISR needs to do
	work = 1;
	wake_up_interruptible(&my_wait);
If you don't set work, the wake_up will have no effect.
