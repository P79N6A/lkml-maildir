I'm probably just totally off the deep end, but something did occur to
me: this looks an awful lot like a special version of the sys_indirect()
idea.  Unless it has been somehow decided that sys_indirect() is the
wrong idea, might it not be better to look at making that interface
solve the extended clone() problem as well?
