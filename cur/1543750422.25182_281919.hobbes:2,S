I'm developing a kernel patch that provides simple and handy
MAC(mandatory access control) functionality, much easier than SELinux.
And now I'm porting the patch from 2.4 to 2.6,
though the patch can't support LSM, for it refers 'struct vfsmount'.
At first, I doubted that some kernel function (do_execve(), memory management
functions, or any kernel functions that are always called by every process) is
doing this CAP_SYS_ADMIN checking. But may be this CAP_SYS_ADMIN checking is
caused by the Fedora Core 3's libc, not by the kernel.
I don't have 2.6 kernel environment other than Fedora Core 3.
But anyway, I have to give up checking for CAP_SYS_ADMIN .
Thank you.
