As a non-x86 example, the 400 MHz Macintosh G4 motherboard uses three
33 MHz 64-bit PCI slots, and one 66 MHz 32-bit PCI slot for graphics.
However, the new 450 and 500 MHz G4 motherboards replace the 66 MHz PCI
slot with an AGP 2x slot (and other interesting things, like internal
400-Mbps FireWire and making the external USB ports dual-channel).
