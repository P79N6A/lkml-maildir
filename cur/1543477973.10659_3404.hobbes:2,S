I guess this system is running "PowerPC Open Firmware". You can change the
load address via the firmware menu:
  Administrative Options...
    ---> Modify the Configuration Settings...
          ---> Edit Configuration Variables
step to the parameter "load-base" and enter a new value (decimal).
One other problem is the this firmware version obviously does not provide
residual data. So Linux will probably not find the PCI devices correctly.
