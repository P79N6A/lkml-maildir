Actually yes, it needs to be visible to the user and no, it probably should not run during boot.
If user is in plane/train, accellerometers will basically detect problems all the time;
still you want to use the computer.
(And you still want the machine to boot => default == fall detection off).
IIRC there's windows program to control it.
