While i'm against whitespace damaged files or patches since my very
first patch, and don't like brain damaged programmer's tools called
text editors, i also want to encourage UNIX-way of using userspace.
Of course, i might be wrong and foolish. Anyway, what i'm trying to do
is not to become new generation of Visual Perl#(R) implemented in
Java(R) using XML with userspace, that suck.
Many things in XXI century still can be done by tools founded 20-30
years ago. Why not try to?
Here is script proposal and test case, just for interested parties.

 The return value is zero for success, else a negative errno.  It should
 be checked, since the get/set calls don't have error returns and since
 misconfiguration is possible.  (These calls could sleep.)
