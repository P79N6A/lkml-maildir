The sysfs interface to hardware monitoring chips changed between kernels
2.6.4 and 2.6.5. The user-space tools and library had to be updated
accordingly. You may simply need to get lm_sensors CVS to get your
sensors work again.

Could you please compile your kernel without i2c support and confirm
that the problem is still there? Just to make sure it's unrelated.
Thanks.
