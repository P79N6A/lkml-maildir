I suspect the problem for some of this is that people think of jiffies
as incrementing by 1. If HZ is right then jiffies can be in nS, it just
won't increment by 1. Its also why jiffies() is better on some platforms
because many machines can answer "what time is it" far more accurately
than they can set interrupts.
