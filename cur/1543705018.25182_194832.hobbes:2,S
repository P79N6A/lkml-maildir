Alessandro,
Looks like you've identifed a regression, probably in ACPI.
Please test the 1st patch attached to this bug report
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1766
If it doesn't address the problem, please file an additional bug report
per below.
thanks,
-Len
ps.
The divide-by zero symptom should be addressed by Dominik's update, now
in the ACPI tree and thus the next -mm patch.
pps.
