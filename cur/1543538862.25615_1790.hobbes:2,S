.. but things are changing.
I want you guys to look at your computer screen, imagining the worst
monster you can (the cacodeamon from Quake will do, just make him hairier
and bigger and more MEAN), and think of me. Think of me like I am when I
see a patch which isn't a pure bug-fix.
If you're whimpering just _thinking_ about sending me a new feature,
you're in the right mindframe. Keep that mindframe.
