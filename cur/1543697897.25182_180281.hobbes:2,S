I'm thinking that it may actually be easier to do this via file paths
instead of file descripters. with file paths something like COW or
zero-copy copy can be done trivially (and the kernel knows the user
credentials of the program issuing the command and can pass them on to the
filesystem to see if it's allowed). I don't see how this can be done with
file descripters (if all you have is a file descripter you can truncate
and write a file, but you don't know all the links to that file so you
can't reposition that first inode for example).

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian W. Kernighan
