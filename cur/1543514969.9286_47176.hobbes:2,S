I would like to know this too. The entry is bogus. If you get ISA DMA hangs
off a Natoma something else is wrong according to every other experience
we have seen.

The first question though is: Assuming the entry is right for someone does 
anyone have and happen to have read the chipset errata. It could be the chipset
does have the bug but there is workaround every other users BIOS is enabling
