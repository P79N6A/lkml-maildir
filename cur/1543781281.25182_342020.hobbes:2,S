due to the wonders of "value range propagation" it actually can, if the
check is done sufficiently before...
gcc keeps track of the range a variable can have at each point, so if
the check is done before, the "possible range" will be such that the
divide should be optimizable.
(Note: this is a relatively new feature in gcc though)
