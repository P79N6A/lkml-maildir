Subject: [patch 31/50] corrupted cramfs filesystems cause kernel oops (CVE-2006-5823)

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Phillip Lougher <phillip@lougher.org.uk>
Steve Grubb's fzfuzzer tool (
http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/files/
fsfuzzer-0.6.tar.gz) generates corrupt Cramfs filesystems which cause
Cramfs to kernel oops in cramfs_uncompress_block().  The cause of the oops
is an unchecked corrupted block length field read by cramfs_readpage().
This patch adds a sanity check to cramfs_readpage() which checks that the
block length field is sensible.  The (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE << 1) size check is
intentional, even though the uncompressed data is not going to be larger
than PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, gzip sometimes generates compressed data larger than
the original source data.  Mkcramfs checks that the compressed size is
always less than or equal to PAGE_CACHE_SIZE << 1.  Of course Cramfs could
use the original uncompressed data in this case, but it doesn't.
