No, they should basically be __va(physical page address).  The kiobuf
tracks a table of "struct page *" to allow us to address memory beyond
4G too.

Wrong move.  You need the VA in the kiobuf in order to be able to map
things beyond the end of memory -- think of mapping a PCI video
framebuffer in a machine with less than 4G of memory.  You don't have a
struct page * to point to those addresses.
In order to be generic memory containers, kiobufs need both.  There will
be some things you can't do unless you have the right type of page, but
the kiobuf should be able to contain any type.
