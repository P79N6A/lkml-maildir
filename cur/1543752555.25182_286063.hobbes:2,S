Yeah, this would do it for sure. Nice work Jens.
Actually, this could block up requests indefinitely couldn't it?

I wonder... could you put failed, starved readers on the writer's
waitqueue and vice versa? AFAIKS this would eliminate special casing
in the fast paths, and also hopefully preserve process ordering.
But either way, it looks like your patch should do the trick as well.
