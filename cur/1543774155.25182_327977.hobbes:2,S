Hi,
- use 2.6.12-mm1, and build all you need into the kernel
- in drivers/pcmcia/ds.c , remove the following block:
                /* also, FUNC_ID matching needs to be activated by userspace
                 * after it has re-checked that there is no possible module
                 * with a prod_id/manf_id/card_id match.
                 */
                if (!dev->allow_func_id_match)
                        return 0;
- it should(tm) work then... though I haven't and can't try it myself.

I'm not sure whether these two aspects exclude each other.
