I see. And I see you went a few steps forward with dignosing it:

It seems rather strange that memcpy gets optimized this way. I could
not have foreseen it. Still, it was worth a try, even if putting 32
extra bytes on stack and running memcpy on them does not seem too
onerous, for a fork(). Thanks for doing it, and let's go with your
original patch then... if Matt Helsley does not mind.
Thank you,

P.S. This syntax seems to cry for being expressed in diff -u:
