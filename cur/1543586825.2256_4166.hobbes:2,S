You never mentioned doing things within the kernel. It's a lot easier
within the kernel.

This will give an idea of the many options available. In the simpist
case, you can spin-lock entry into your code, set a semaphore, then
schedule() until it changes. You have down(&semaphore) to do the
whole thing, or you can do it yourself as in serial.c:
		When the last requst to the device has been
		aborted, your code sets "my_semaphore" to FALSE.
		You have to do in under the "my_lock" lock to
		be free of all races.
		spin_lock_irqsave(&my_lock, flags);
                my_semaphore = FALSE;
                spin_lock_irqrestore(&my_lock, flags);
		driver wait-thread does:
		spin_lock_irqsave(&my_lock, flags);
                my_semaphore = TRUE;
                spin_lock_irqrestore(&my_lock, flags);
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
                while(my_semaphore == TRUE)
                    schedule();
Note that you can even schedule with the interrupts OFF, but you can't
schedule from an interrupt-service routine. There is a difference!
Even if queued requests get cleared before you even look at your
semaphore, there is no race.
