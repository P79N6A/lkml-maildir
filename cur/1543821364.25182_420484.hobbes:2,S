It's great if you actually need the file data that gets stored.

I don't believe that matters, and certainly doesn't seem to affect my
own system.
If I use a smaller swap file, I just run out faster.
Is your experience different?

Sure it will run, but I *want* swap to be used to remove unused
programs.
My current problem is that *useful* program code is being swapped out and
being replaced by *useless* cached file data.

I've not seen ionice.
