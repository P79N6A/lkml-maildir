I compared reiserfs with notails and with tails to
ext3 in journaled mode about a month ago.
Strangely enough the machine that was being
built is eventually slated for a mail machine.  I used
postmark to simulate the mail environment.
Benchmarks are available here:

Let me know if I am missing any info on there.
