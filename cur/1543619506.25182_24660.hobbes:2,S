Uugh, the else is wrong of course. The owner has to be set in any
case.(Just deleted some debugging code and reformatted a bit to quick
:))
A further note: Although the combilock shares some advantages with a
spin-lock (no unnecessary scheduling for short time locking) it may
behave like a semaphore on entry also if you call combi_spin_lock.
For example
       spin_lock(&slock);
       combi_spin_lock(&clock);
is a BUG because combi_spin_lock may sleep while holding slock!
Would be nice if there were some comments.
