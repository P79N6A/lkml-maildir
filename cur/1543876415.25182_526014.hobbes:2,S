It is ok and I see no indication of lookup. You have two errors logged:
a) a missing entry in the kernel translation table for your default
codepage to UCS-16 (Unicode).
    "char2uni returned -22"  (EINVAL, presumably due to a missing character)
b) some access denied (-13) warnings on cifs_get_info_info (lookup).
This is probably harmless.
We could isolate the failing character by modifying the error log entry
but you may be able to guess at the problem by seeing which filenames
are requested with '?' in it ('?' is used when translation to Unicode
fails)
We could probably isolate the missing character by checking what
is logged to dmesag after this minor modification to the warning
message (we would also need to know which nls codepage
you are running).
