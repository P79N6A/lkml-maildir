That's ok. We're all idiots.
However, in this case the patch is wrong, for reasons you couldn't know: 
since people pointed out the problems with the thing, I contacted Hennus 
(google is your friend - don't use old emails addresses), and he replied:

so we should at least wait for that. So far I haven't heard anything else.
Now, if it's true that the driver can't actually work, and hasn't worked 
in a long time, that's a different issue, but I'd like somebody to verify 
that first. If nobody uses the driver any more, we can certainly decide to 
remove it just for that reason. Does it compile? Have distribution makers 
had any reports about that driver in the last couple of years?
