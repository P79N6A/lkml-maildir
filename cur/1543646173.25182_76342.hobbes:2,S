Well I certainly wasn't we have an additional virtual mapping for all
of physical RAM - if nothing else that would waste a bunch of space in
page tables.  I was thinking of a pool of VM out of which to establish
new consistent mappings - with a simple and irq-safe allocated working
within the pre-allocated chunk of VM.
Which of course raises the hard question: how big should the pool be?
It would be possible to have something running in user context which
tops up the pool if it is low, but that starts getting complex, and
wouldn't help a driver which wants to allocate a large chunk of
consistent memory from interrupt context.

Well, that sounds like it would work.  On the other hand, it seems
like a non-trivial set of modifications to the VM structure.
