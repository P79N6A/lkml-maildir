Yes, something like that would be nice.
However, the case still remains that I think Linus' proposed overall
packet infrastructure is the right thing to do.  That way a uniform
API would be available for poking at any device that supports MMC (is
that the correct term these days?) commands, regardless of the type
of device and the lower-level transports.
People have -- correctly -- corrected me on the "ATAPI = SCSI over
IDE" issue.  When I think of SCSI, I tend to think of what a network
engineer would call "the upper data link layer", i.e. the command
packet frame format.  I did not mean to imply that the physical
interface (PHY), or the lower data link layer (MAC) where the same.  I
also realize that there are differences, but *from what I've seen*
they seem to be relatively minor.
I meant to start a discussion, not "call a vote", especially not
w.r.t. the lower-level implementation details.
