According to the above link, unmount was the problem as well.
I know little about lockdep, but if this really is the superblock
lock that we are oopsing on then I cannot see how XFS is involved
at all seeing as it does not ever touch the superblock lock.
I'd say the first step is to get a lockdep expert to explain why
we are oopsing here....

Don't use lockdep with XFS yet. XFS hasn't been instrumented
with lockdep notations, so nothing good will come from using
it right now. There is work in progress to fix this, but it's not
ready yet.
Cheers,
