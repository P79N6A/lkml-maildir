# kbuild: Remove cscope.out during make mrproper
# 
# From: "Nathan T. Lynch" <ntl@pobox.com>
# 
# The attached patch fixes the toplevel Makefile to remove cscope.out
# during make mrproper.  The default name for the database that cscope
# creates is cscope.out, and this is what the cscope rule in the
# makefile uses.  Currently, mrproper will leave cscope.out behind,
# which can make for interesting diffs...
