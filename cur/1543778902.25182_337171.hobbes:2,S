Interbench is a Linux Kernel Interactivity Benchmark.

Changes:
3 new loads were added:
Gaming benchmark:
This simulates an unlocked frame rate cpu intensive 3d gaming environment. It 
measures the latencies mean/sd/max and desired cpu percentage only. These 
should give a marker of frame rate stability (latencies), and maximum frame 
rates under different loads (desired cpu percentage). As this simulates an 
unlocked frame rate the deadlines met is meaningless. This does not 
accurately emulate a 3d game which is gpu bound, only a cpu bound one.
Hackbench:
Taken from Rusty's hackbench code as suggested by Ingo Molnar, this will run 
'hackbench 50' repeatedly in the background when benchmarking real time 
performance.
Custom:
Based on the periodic scheduling used for audio/video, custom will allow you 
to specify a cpu percentage and frame rate of a custom workload, and this can 
be used to benchmark this workload's performance under normal scheduling, 
real time scheduling or it can be used as a background load.
Bugfixes:
Numerous floating point and overflow errors were tracked down and fixed. These 
are responsible for results like 'nan' and 4294... which is basically 2^32. 
Unfortunately the standard deviation reported in previous versions appears to 
have been bogus, but fortunately little value was placed on this result.
Error handling was made _much_ more robust - for example it was found that 
contrary to 'man sem_wait' but consistent with SUSv3, sem_wait can return -1 
with -EINTR.
Lots of little tweaks.
Cheers,
Con
