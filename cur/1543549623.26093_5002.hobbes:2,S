Erm... Did you miss the fact that minixfs/sysvfs/UFS are choke-full of
fs-corrupting races? Patch for minixfs had been posted 3 times during the
last couple of weeks, each time with [CFT] in subject. So far - 0
(zero) responces. I'm way past the stage when I gave a damn - it works
here and if I will not receive any bug reports it will go to Linus on
Tuesday.
And no, that stuff has nothing to lock_super(). But unless people will
test the patches posted on l-k and fsdevel - too fscking bad, stuff _will_
break.
