Subject: PCI interrupt sharing problem (2.0 -> 2.2)

My aic7800 and eepro100 are both on irq 15. This was OK on 2.0.36
but when I drop in 2.2.0 the box locks solid when the network script
hits 'ifconfig eth0 up'.
I have upgraded all my user mode stuff according to Changes.
The only way I fixed this was to move the eepro100 to another PCI
slot to change it's irq to 11. This is bad news for me as I'm desparate
for lots of irqs on ISA.
