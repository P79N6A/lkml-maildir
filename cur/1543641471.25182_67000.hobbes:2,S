    Hi Pavel :))
>Being able to "blank now" is very important for handheld devices
    And for computers that are always up with the monitor powered off
;). This key is just a *great* idea. No I will be able to turn off my
monitor 'by software' ;)) (BTW I don't use power saver nor
autoblanking and must switch off my monitor if I want to save power
and/or CRT life).
    Thanks for the idea (and the patch, of course ;))
