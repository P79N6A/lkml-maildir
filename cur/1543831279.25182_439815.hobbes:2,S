Subject: [PATCH] Bring x86-64 ia32 emul in sync with i386 on READ_IMPLIES_EXEC enabling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently ia32 binaries behave differently with respect to enabling
READ_IMPLIES_EXEC. On i386 a binary with the exec_stack flag set is
executed with READ_IMPLIES_EXEC enabled as well. The same binary
executes without READ_IMPLIES_EXEC on x86-64.
This causes binaries that work on i386 to fail on x86-64 which goes
somewhat against the whole 32 bit emulation idea.
It has been argued that READ_IMPLIES_EXEC should not be enabled at all
for binaries that have the exec_stack flag. Which is probably a valid
point. However until this is clarified I think x86-64 should behave the
same for ia32 binaries as i386.
The following patch brings x86-64 in sync with i386 for ia32 binaries.
