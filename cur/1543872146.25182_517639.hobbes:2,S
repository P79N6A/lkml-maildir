Ok, good.

... which occurs /after/ userspace is up and running, when sysfs is
available.  So putting it in sysfs is reasonable.

So all ports change behaviour with a single parameter?  That'll stop
NULL modem cables with hardware flow control enabled working on other
ports without compensatory tweaking.
No, doing a system-wide change like that is _not_ a solution - it just
moves the problem elsewhere.
