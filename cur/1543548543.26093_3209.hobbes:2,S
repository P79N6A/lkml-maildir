login checks that /etc/securetty contains the terminal name,
where the latter is obtained (since util-linux 2.10h)
from ttyname(0) by deleting a leading "/dev/" if possible.
And ttyname(0) does a readlink("/proc/self/fd/0"), which will
return the pathname that was first used to open file descriptor 0.
Maybe no change of login is required if one has 2.10h or later,
provided one adapts /etc/securetty.
