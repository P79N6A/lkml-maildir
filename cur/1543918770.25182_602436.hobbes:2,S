No, I tried that. It's ugly.
The per cpu accounting is the correct way to go if we want to take
care of those systems, which ignore the CPU0 binding of irq0.
See patch against the x86 tree below.

    x86: Fix irq0 / local apic timer accounting
    
    The clock events merge introduced a change to the nmi watchdog code to
    handle the not longer increasing local apic timer count in the
    broadcast mode. This is fine for UP, but on SMP it pampers over a
    stuck CPU which is not handling the broadcast interrupt due to the
    unconditional sum up of local apic timer count and irq0 count.
    
    To cover all cases we need to keep track on which CPU irq0 is
    handled. In theory this is CPU#0 due to the explicit disabling of irq
    balancing for irq0, but there are systems which ignore this on the
    hardware level. The per cpu irq0 accounting allows us to remove the
    irq0 to CPU0 binding as well.
    
    Add a per cpu counter for irq0 and evaluate this instead of the global
    irq0 count in the nmi watchdog code.
