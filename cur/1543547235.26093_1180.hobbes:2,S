   At the marked line (! - line 647), what if flip.count is equal to
   TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE?  Surely we're writing to a character outside the
   flag_buf_ptr array?  If that is the case, should we not move this
   like until after the "goto ignore_char"?  Also, does it matter that
   we don't place a character in the character buffer at the overrun
   position?
Yup, that's an obvious bug, thanks for pointing that out..  I'll get a
correction to Linus.
