Check dosemu. The _real_ problem with /proc/<pid>/mem is that it needs
very different behaviour in different parts of process address space. Just
aliasing every page and hoping that extra reference will save your day is
_very_ bad idea - behaviour of pages on swapout, etc. is determined by
vma, not by reference in page table. We _might_ go for /proc/<pid>/object/
a-la Slowlaris, and that might be made mmap'able, but that's a separate
story. And IMO an overkill.
Dosemu does aliasing in very similar situation. Check how it's done.
