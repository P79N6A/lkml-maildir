  Same way as you have to remember to iounmap it now...
  Now ethernet drivers do request_mem_region with completely meaningless address
from another address space than /proc/iomem covers. I saw report with this
request_mem_region failing to register ioremapped memory at 0xd2xxxxxx
because of BIOS assigned physical range d0000000-d7ffffff to another device.
  You are correct that currently Donald does not store device physical
address anywhere and stores virtual address in base_address item instead.
It is also wrong idea; report from ifconfig that I have eth0 at
0xd2544000 is completely meaningless and useless as after rmmod & insmod
it lives on different address... But it is another bug.
  So what is correct solution from your point of view? Remove ioremap()
from drivers/pci/scan.c and move it to all ethernet drivers or add
request_resource to drivers/pci/scan.c and remove it from all ethernet
drivers?
  From my point of view it should
(1) store device physical address into netdevice's base_address. This
  ensures backward compatibility and useful data exported to userspace.
  Reporting kernel virtual address to userspace is useless.
(2) store device virtual address into netdevice's priv field, if device
  does not use it priv structure. Maybe specific vbase_addr field is better,
  network device drivers can probably provide better comments on this (fbdev
  has base & vbase... base is exported to userspace & passed to allocation/
  deallocation functions, vbase is really used)
(3) drivers/pci/scan.c passes physical address to driver.
  Driver can create virtual mapping by ioremap if it needs it.
(4) it is driver task to determine resource type (by checking
  pci_tbl[chip_idx].pci_flags), call appropriate request_{mem,}region
  and ioremap. If probe function fails, it must iounmap virtual
  mapping and release registered regions.
(5) on driver unload it's driver's task to release regions and
  iounmap virtual mappings.
Step (3) is really annoying, I see alternate solution:
(3) drivers/pci/scan.c passes virtual address to driver. Region passed
  to driver is registered and virtual mapping is build for region.
(4) it is driver task to determine resource type and choose
   readb/inb depending on it. If driver needs physical address,
   it can find it by doing
     pdev->resource[(pci_tbl[chip_idx].pci_flags >> 4) & 7].start
   If probe function fails, it must NOT passed virtual mapping
   and must NOT release passed region.
(5) on driver unload, it is driver's task to release regions and
  iounmap virtual mappings.
I do not know, what is better, but first approach looks more consistent
to me. But it forces all drivers to do same things: they must determine
region type, do appropriate request region, build virtual mapping by
ioremap. And driver which fails to register its region causes big troubles
to itself and/or to system (multiple driver instance for same piece
of hardware, eventually running out of static resources (eth drivers...)).
                                        Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
