Well, if we're going to make a generic bitmap type, it shouldn't have
size limitations, as almost any limit we set will be too small
eventually...  Supporting arbitrary length bitmaps doesn't mean we can't
try to optimize for smaller masks, like less than a couple unsigned
longs, as well as single unsigned long optimizations.
