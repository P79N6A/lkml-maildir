Patch looks good, it seems a merge conflict of
commit 19bc5133dae9562e8824ef101464061f9854c1d8
was resolved the wrong way.
@Mauro:
Any objections against a later path that changes the exports to the 
general "immediately after the function" convention?
It would have avoided at least two such bugs in this file alone since 
2.6.23...
