No.
It is a big mistake to ship a file and overwrite it under the same
name.  It messes up source repositories.
Any code that has an explicit #include <linux/modversions.h> is broken.
The kernel build automatically includes modversions.h when required.
The build instructions for third party modules should say something
like 
  If your kernel was built with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y then add these
  flags to the build for this module
  -DMODVERSIONS -include kernel_source_tree/linux/modversions.h
In any case, modversions.h will disappear in kbuild 2.5.
