Well, I'm doing keyboards in 2.5 only, that's why I didn't comment on
the LKML posting.

That's not correct. The above messages don't disable the keyboard - even
when they appear the kernel still listens to keypresses from the
keyboard - it only doesn't send LED commands to the keyboard anymore
(because it'd have to timeout on each LED command). It'll start sending
LED commands as soon as a keypress from the keyboard arrives.
Which means: The messages are just saying that the keyboard doesn't
work. And it doesn't for some reason. But the reason is not the
messages.

This may be caused by the same problem.
What BIOS timing setup are you using? Have you by any chance 'tuned' the
board for better performance?

This is a known vt82c686a bug. Workarounds exist in various kernels.
2.4.18 has an incomplete workaround which isn't used if the CPU supports
TSC.

I hate bugreports done by exactly following the bugreport cookbook. ;)

... because I don't need to know a small shell script isn't applicable,
for example ...

Yes, a vt82c686a buggy chip ...
