Ouch and... on cpus without working hlt (old i386s) "rep nop" magic
(from pentium 4!) is not going to help. 
Also, AFAIK all cpus supporting "rep nop" have good thermal
protection, anyway. So it should be enough to KISS and do 
local_irq_disable();
while (1)
	halt();

Here you halt without minimal checking. Actually you probably do not
need to check -- you want to kill the machine, and hlt's only problem
was that it occassionally killed the machine on old i386s :-).
