	OK, I'll try to bisect in a few weeks.

	Hmm, I have tried to run this, and got a machine lockup, and after
a minute or so the following has been printed to the console:
~BUG: spinlock lockup on CPU#0, sshd/1671, ffffffff80557780
(I was logged in using ssh, and ran the above code inside the ssh session).
	I have tried to look at it from the remote side as well:
stracing the "find / -print" revealed that after some time,
the write(1, "/file/name/...", ...) call returned -EIO.
And from this point on, all subsequent writes to fd #1 did return
-EIO as well.
