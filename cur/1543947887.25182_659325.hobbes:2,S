As i said it before, it's totally senseless to add zillions of 
defconfigs to x86. The two that are there should be enough for a 
sniff-test - and much more than that has to be done to ensure that a 
patch doesnt break anything. Not even a 100 defconfigs would match 
proper randconfig coverage.
according to one particular arbitrary piece of metrics [1], ~99.15% of 
our testers use x86 - and the oopses collected on kerneloops.org show a 
similar proportion.

sorry, s/build-tested/boot-tested.
there's been only 6 commits to arch/v850 between v2.6.23 and v2.6.24.
None of them seems to suggest that anyone ever tested v850 in the last
year or so.
