Ouch yes.

Agreed. I looked at that but it seemed that it isn't true that you can
assume port_no == hard_port_no because you may have a device which has
the primary port disabled and the secondary port set legacy. This also
sort of comes up in mixed devices but we don't handle them and I think
it comes out correctly once we do the pure legacy case right.

Think about the following execution sequence
ati_pci_init_one
	primary port already stolen by drivers/ide 
	secondary port free
	legacy_mode = ATA_PORT_SECONDARY
	ata_pci_init_legacy_port
	port_num = 0
	hard_port_num = 1

I agree with the theory and the diagnosis. I'm a bit worried about
hard_port_no however and I don't think that bit is safe in the secondary
only corner case. Registering both always and disabling one works for me
as a cleanup.
If you do that then I'll audit all the drivers use of ->port_no against
the patches.
