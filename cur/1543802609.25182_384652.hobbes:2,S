If they don't, they should not touch the option...

I think the help text is good enough, but it would definitely be nice
with a fuller description of what exactly low and high memory is and the
implications of the various settings.

It tells you that the remaining memory is available as high memory, so
it's not lost of course. It also tells you that accessing this high
memory is indeed possible, but it's a little more costly since it needs
to be mapped temporarily into the kernel address space.

No worries, perhaps you will be the one writing the Documentation/ bit
to accompany this then :-)
Basically the option boils down to how much virtual address space you
want to assign to the kernel and user space. The kernel can always
access all of memory, but in some cases part of that memory will be
available as high memory that needs to be mapped in first (see
references to kmap() and kmap_atomic() in the kernel). So whether
changing the mapping or using highmem is the best option for you,
depends entirely on what you run on that machine. If you require a huge
user address space, then you don't want to change away from the 3/1
user/kernel default setting. However, if you don't need the full 3G of
adress space to user apps, then you are better off increasing the kernel
address space range to get rid of the high memory mapping.
For the "typical" case of 1GB machine, using the _OPT setting to just
move the offset slightly is a really good choice as it only removes a
little bit of the user address range.
