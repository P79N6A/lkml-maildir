IIRC, Jeff had the idea, to use sched_yield() for this (from a discussion on #uml).
S390 does something similar using a special DIAG-opcode that gives permission to zVM,
that another Guest might run.
On a host running many UMLs, this might improve performance.
So, I would like to have the small patch below (it's not tested, just an idea).
