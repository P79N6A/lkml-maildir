Polling people inside of SGI, they seem to think that a per file memory policy
is a good thing, but it needs to be settable from outside the process without
changing the header or code of the process (think of an ISV application that
we want to run on Altix.)  I can't quite get my head around what that means
(do you have to specify this externally based on the order that files are
opened in [e. g. file 1 has policy this, file 2 has policy that, etc] or does
one specify this by type of file [text, mapped file, etc]).  Does this end up
being effectively a per process policy with a per file override?  (e. g. all
files for this process are managed with policy "this", except for the 5th file
opened [or whatever] and it has policy "that".)
Steve -- how does your MTA design handle this?
Anyway, I'm about to throw in the towel on the per process page cache memory
policy.  I can't make a strong enough argument for it.
I assume that is acceptable, Andi?  :-)
