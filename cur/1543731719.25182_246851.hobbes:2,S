Thanks!

Is it really necessary to tell Alessandro Rubini, Stephane Eranian,
Andrew Morton, Werner Almesberger, John Levon, Nikita Danilov
that their work makes you vomit?
Many kernel people have such unpleasant habits.
It fully suffices to say that you considered the original code
too ugly to fix.

Your code still requires some polishing. No localized messages, etc.
And next, you removed some features, but do not indicate what
replacement you see.
For example, Andrew added the -M option that sets a frequency.
Are you going to contribute a write_profile too?
Or do you think nobody should wish to set a frequency?
