Hi,
Use map_user_kiobuf to do this. There are several examples
in the kernel tree. One of the simplest may be 
arch/cris/drivers/examples/kiobuftest.c.

Next question would be what are the steps that the driver need to ping user
pages before setting up the xfer?
Thanks.

Yes. Its used both for O_DIRECT I/O (direct to disk I/O from userspace) and
for things like tv capture cards. The kernel allows a driver to pin user
pages and obtain mappings for them. Note that for large systems user pages
may be above the 32bit boundary so you need DAC capable hardware to get the
best results
