Easy. A lot of FB stuff has been nonworking at various stages, since the
whole console layer has been more or less rewritten over the course of 2.5.
(Of course, a lot of kernel internals have changed, so entire *CPU architectures*
have been uncompilable for significant periods of time.)

A search of message archives via groups.google.com yields this site quite
quickly:
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest
Please also read this message from two days ago:

Because, it seems, support is planned but there hasn't been time to get all the
issues hammered out. (A lot of kernel devs still are volunteers that have to do
this in whatever free time they have, between actual jobs or, sometimes more
importantly, between searching for jobs, so things don't always happen instantly.)
You might be able to get a feel for the future/current situation of the fb
code if you had a read through your favorite lkml archive, if you're not
subscribed. It looks like the questions or doubts you bring up in this mail
would be answered by doing so.
