Jeff,
Thanks for verifying it is passed through the kernel to initrd, another 
kernel component.    It's also stored as EXT meta data
(also in the kernel).  and retrieved from there.  And its not accessible 
from normal user space applications (except in raw mode).
One of these days you need to get down to Lindon for lunch.  I'll even buy.
Jeff
