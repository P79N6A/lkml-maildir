I don't need this; most of my hypercalls are non-blocking. The ones that
are can already undo the load themselves, no big deal.

hm could do I suppose
One thing I'd like to see is some way to do batched hypercalls. I don't
quite know how this will work in general, but let me explain the
scenario:
The guest submits a bunch of disk IO requests into a submit queue.
The host gets a hypercall and goes to process the submit queue
While this is processing, the guest submits more IO
The guest would here do another hypercall.. 
.. but what could be done is have the host poll at the end of it's scan
of the queue if there's more, and while the host is scanning, just
disable the hypercall the guest would make. So that if there is a
"submit while scanning/processing" going on, no need for more
hypercalls. 
(Otoh... the current situation isn't all that bad, there's one hypercall
for an entire batch of IO's, and the blocklayer isn't all that bad at
giving us nice large batches)
