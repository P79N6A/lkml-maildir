Now I compiled kernel with gcc-2.95.3 and:
 22:37:12 up 7 days, 22:34,  2 users,  load average: 0.40, 0.41, 0.43
So, gcc 3.4 and kernel 2.6 do not like each others.
Finding the actual bug (in kernel or compiler) left as an exercise
for some brave hacker.
I know what Documentation/Changes says about GCC versions.
It's just that I am stubborn and I hoped 3.4.x would just work,
since 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 series have produced perfectly working
2.4.x kernels (and 3.4.x has produced perfectly working non-kernel
stuffs).
