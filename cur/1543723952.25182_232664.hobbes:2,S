Sure. Use two (or more) tasks. It is a per-process limit because
in Unix the kernel shares the processes address space. See
how your process is laid out by executing this:
#include <stdio.h>
extern char _start;
extern char _end;
char dat;
const char x[]="x";
int main()
{
    char foo;
    printf("start = %p\n", &_start);
    printf(" main = %p\n", main);
    printf(" data = %p\n", &dat);
    printf("const = %p\n", x);
    printf("stack = %p\n", &foo);
    printf("  end = %p\n", &_end);
    return 0;
}
Cheers,
