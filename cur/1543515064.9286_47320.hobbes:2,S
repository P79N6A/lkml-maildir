The help in v2.2.xx kernels says:
  If you say Y here, you won't need "Kernel support for JAVA binaries"
  (CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA) or "Kernel support for Linux/Intel ELF
  binaries" (CONFIG_BINFMT_EM86), as this is a more general solution.
Note that is says that you don't need CONFIG_BINFMT_EM86, which is a
compability option for the Alpha to be able to execute Intel/ELF binaries.
The ELF option itself is named CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF. I surely agree that the
help is a bit vague. This has been fixed in the v2.3.xx help-file,
however.

Maybe we should backport the help...

I think you sent it to the right place...
