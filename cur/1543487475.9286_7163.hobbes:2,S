Though not documented in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes (misprint
in the sysklogd section mentions power-off, when I believe it should be
pertaining to sysvinit), you should install sysvinit-2.76.  I get it at
ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/miquels/software/sysvinit-2.76.tar.gz
I happen to have Debian 2.0 installed, and I use "shutdown -h now" in
order to poweroff my machine.  This works as it should with kernel
2.2.x.  The halt script's last line contains "halt -d -f -i -p"
