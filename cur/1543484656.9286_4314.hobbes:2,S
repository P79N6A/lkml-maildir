If you just want to build a kernel for a system like this,
I see two alternate answers:
(1) Get the source on a cd-rom and build from the cd-rom.
    This will take about 10-15 megabytes on the hard disk,
    and it needs the Dancing Makefiles.
(2) If someone sets up a web-based kernel build service,
    this would be a practical use of it, in addition to the
    sheer hack value.
Both of these are more general purpose and cooler than messing
with the One True Tarball.
