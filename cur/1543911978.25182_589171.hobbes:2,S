The code in question is just moved, not rewritten, so those are
preexisting problems that I was just adding a whiny comment about in
hopes it would remind me some more patches were probably needed.
(Thanks for the reminder....)

The problem isn't the wait for the rpc itself, it's the creation of the
new cred that's needed in the gss case.  That could also be made
asynchronous, but as there's several other delicate changes in the
pipeline (keyring stuff, etc.), I'd rather not touch it for now.

Yep, probably so.
