I know.  flz(x) is basically __ilog2(~x), and I still say clo would be
better.  Removing flz() sounds reasonable, though.

I'd got that slightly wrong.  Yeah, fls(x) returned flz(~x) + 1, which
is __ilog2(~~x) + 1.  So obviously clz was fine for that, but it needed
cleaning up.
Shame about popc on SPARC.  However, ffz is cheese, regardless of pops.
(On sparc64, ffs is too.)  I'll wait for the generic bitops patches to
be dealt with (or not) and then submit a patch fixing this if needed.
Thanks,

By the way, I really hope nobody gets ten copies of this, as happened
with my last post.  It does not seem to be my fault, AFAICS.
