Once again I take ac's advice, and once again I am slightly better
off. I changed my DMA setting from 3 to 1 and I was again able to play
wav files, and record from /dev/dsp. Very cool.
However, now another problem creeps in. After changing the DMA to 1, I
fire up x11amp and start playing some tunes. They sound great. But
then I go over to the browser (netscape) and start scrolling the page
around and the mp3 tune starts skipping like crazy, not too mention
the scrolling performance is very slow. I notice that do other things
like, um, typing in a bash window, cause slight skipping in the mp3
tunes.
MP3's play fine with DMA at 3 or 0, but then I can't play wav files or
record from /dev/dsp.
