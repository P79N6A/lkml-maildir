Yes, they are quite good actually:
http://unichrome.sourceforge.net/
The biggest problem is that the via DRM module is not in the kernel yet.
You will have to install it from dri.sourceforge.net CVS.  It was in a
recent -mm release but was dropped and unfortunately the current version
doesn't work with the -mm kernel.  Andrew Morton & others have said they
will try to get it back in soon.
