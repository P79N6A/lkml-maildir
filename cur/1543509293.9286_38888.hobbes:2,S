Hello all,
Heres my problem: parport_pc can't detect the ECP port on my Compaq
Armada 7400
This is from /var/log/messages:
kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7, dma 3 [SPP,PS2]
There is no problem with the same kernel (2.2.12) on my desktop (HP
KAYAK XA6).
Distro is SuSE 6.1
I have no printers or other parallel port devices other than a couple of
dongles I need to get working with vmware/Win98.
What should I do / tell you next?
