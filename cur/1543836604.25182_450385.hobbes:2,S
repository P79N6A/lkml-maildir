This is _exactly_ what SELinux does for you.  You can break down  
permissions on very nearly a per-syscall basis (not quite, for  
efficiency reasons, but pretty damn close).

You're quite wrong about SELinux; it _is_ part of the kernel.   
Admittedly it requires a policy to be built and loaded from  
userspace, but your "ACLs" would require some ACL utilities to apply  
those from userspace.  In any case SELinux is an extremely powerful  
model; you can define your arbitrary RBAC+TE state machine and  
constraints, then the kernel applies it to your system; as simple (or  
horribly complicated, as the case may be) as that.

Here's a better security model:  SELinux lets you give root access to  
everybody and still have a 100% secure system (although it's not  
really recommended).  Google around for the public SSH-accessible  
SELinux testbeds with root's password set to "password" or "1234" or  
whatever and feel free to log in and have a look.  Besides, we do  
have POSIX ACLs on files; if that's what you're looking for, but  
that's not extensible enough to cover processes too.
