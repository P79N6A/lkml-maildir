Btw, I think the _right_ thing to check is the write access of the file 
descriptor. If you have write access to a block device, you can delete the 
data, so you might as well be able to do the raw commands. And that would 
allow things like "disk" groups etc to work and burn CD's.
However, right now we don't even pass down the "struct file" to this 
function. We probably should. Anybody willing to go through the callers? 
(just a few callers, but things like cdrom_command() doesn't even have the 
file, so it has to be recursive).
