It isn't that a cache needs to expire.  It sounds like it is a cache
that needs to be filled.
The kernel keeps a cache of ip addresses that are allowed access to
particular filesystems.  This is visible through /proc/fs/nfs/exports.
It is filled at reboot by "exportfs -a" or "exportfs -r" which gets
information from /etc/exports and /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
So check that /etc/exports contains the right info.
Check that /var/lib/nfs/rmtab lists the filesystems and clients that
you expect to have access, and then run "exportfs -av"
