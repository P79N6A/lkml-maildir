Now that you're liking, here goes a more contained jackd test-suite (see
attached tarball, jackd_test3.1.tar.gz).
Just launch the provided shell script, from the command line as:
  ./jack_test3_run.sh [secs] [clients] [ports]
where:
  secs    - number of seconds to run jackd workload (default = 300)
  clients - number of test-clients to run (default = 14)
  ports   - number of interface ports per client (default = 4)
As before, each client (jack_test3_client) registers the same number of
input and output ports (default is 4ins x 4outs), where each output is the
audio mix of all inputs.
Note that you can breakup the 14 client barrier, as that limit seems to be
related to the maximum number of client ports jackd can handle by default
(128). The jack_test_run.sh script sets this jackd maximum port limit
number as it sees fit, so any number of clients greater than 14 is
allowed, provided there's enough CPU and/or RAM ;)
Now, with the default workload (14 clients * 4 * 4 ports) I'm reaching 60%
of CPU, and a "fair" number of XRUNs on my P4@2.5G laptop, against the
on-board alsa driver (snd-ali5451), while under RT-V0.7.30-2.
Each test run produces a kernel-timestamped log filename with the complete
captured stdout/err. Consolidated results can be produced by feeding
several of those logfiles into the jack_test3_consolidated.awk script,
just like this:
   cat *.log | awk -f jack_test3_consolidated.awk
Enjoy.
