           Summary: Boot hang on HP ZE4145

I am unable to get ACPI working on my ZE4145 Laptop (BIOS Rev KA.M1.20).  I
have tried 2.4.18 w/ ACPI patch, 2.4.21 w/ ACPI patch, 2.5.53, 2.5.64, and
2.5.65 and have tried pci=acpi and pci=nobios and get the same error with
each one.  I enabled Debug mode for ACPI and this basically what happens.
