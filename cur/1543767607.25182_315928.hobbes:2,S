Yes.  Almost no one will notice whether that build took 2 or 4 seconds.
But a few seconds is an eternity when you are staring at a blank pane,
waiting for it to render the message list.  And I found that when
waiting for the message list to render, backgrounding the build causes
it to render in a second or two, while if I just wait for it it might
take 20 seconds.  This implies that the scheduler could do the same
thing.
Anyway, this was not a great example, as the problem turned out to be an
application bug.  If I can find a non-pathological case that
demonstrates a scheduler problem, I'll post it.
