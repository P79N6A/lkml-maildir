What I mean is to directly patch the exception entry code, so after the 
initialization is complete you'll have no additional overhead.
In the EXC_XFER_TEMPLATE() macro the handler is stored at i##n. You can 
either export that address or you can use a special transfer handler, 
which automatically patches the values once some flag is set.
