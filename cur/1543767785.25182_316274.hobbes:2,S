I like to let hci_suspend_dev() and hci_resume_dev() stay for now. No
driver uses it, but actually nobody really looked deep enough to really
understand the needs for suspend of Bluetooth devices.
The hci_dev_get(), hci_send_cmd() and hci_si_event() doesn't need to be
exported. And I think that the bt_dump() and and BT_DMP() stuff can be
removed completely.
Please redo the patch and actually it is enough to copy the bluez-devel
mailing list. I will take care of getting it back into mainline.
Regards
Marcel
