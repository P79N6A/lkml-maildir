   If not, then I guess I can use
   pci_alloc_consistent and pci_map_single as necessary, since they
   should can potentially know that I am using a device that
   only understands 32-bit addresses, from my earlier call to
   pci_set_dma_mask.  However, I assume that it is considered
   simpler and therefore better to avoid these routines when possible.
Just use pci_alloc_consistent, it never gives you
anything larger than 32-bit addresses, please read the
documentation :-)
On 64-bit platforms without CONFIG_HIGHMEM, kmalloc can return any
pointer, but that is fine since your DMA mask will instruct the
IOMMU layer of the platform to map it in the low 32-bits of DMA
address space.
If you follow DMA-mapping.txt to the letter, it will just work, trust
us. :-)
