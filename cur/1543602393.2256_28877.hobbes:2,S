Since your main concern seems to be simplicity, the code can remain
the way it is and be far more readable with, e.g.,
/* Aquire lock1 while holding lock2--reverse order. */
#define spin_reverse_lock(lock1,lock2)     \
    if (unlikely(!spin_trylock(&lock1))) { \           
            spin_unlock(&lock2);           \        
            spin_lock(&lock1);             \          
            spin_lock(&lock2);             \        
    }                                                          
You can't argue for simple in favor of increasing lock contention,
but you can keep it readable.
