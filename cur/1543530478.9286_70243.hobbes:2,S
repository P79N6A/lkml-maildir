Hello all,
	I ran into a couple of errors that I finally managed to "connect".
	When ever I did a "make modules_install", I would get this:
] [root@chaos linux]# make modules_install
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/block
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/net
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/ipv4
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/fs
] cp: serial.o: No such file or directory
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/usb
] Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.3.51/misc
] [root@chaos linux]# 
	Sure enough, there is no file serial.o in the modules directory.
	Then I noticed that usb-serial.o is not getting installed in the
/lib/modules directory.  I have USB generic serial support enabled in
my configuration and usb-serial.o is in the modules directory in the
source tree.
	A check of modules/USB_MODULES reveals what I expected.  It lists
serial.o but not usb-serial.o.  So I guess there is a typo in the
configurations somewhere.
	Kernel verison 2.3.51.
	As a side note...  The USB device I'm hooking up is the D-Link
DSB-H3SP multifunction hub.  This has 3 A ports plus a serial and
parallel port.   The Hub itself is recognized and the parallel port
is recognized but the serial comes up "This device is not recognized
by any installed USB driver".  I've also got a DSB-H4SMK multifunction
hub that has 4 A ports plus serial plus PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse.
Between the two hubs I end up with 7 A ports, Keyboard, Mouse, Parallel
plus two serial ports (once I get the serial ports working).
	Mike
