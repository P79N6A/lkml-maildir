OK, though I would prefer to differentiate "initial value is 0" from
"initial value doesn't matter".

It's useful for debugging userspace too. Apps like the hdapsd daemon

No idea, nor a way to check (on all relevant models). We've always

correctly following the H8S LPC protocol.
OK on all other comments to patches 06-08.
