SuSEs SLES8 is out for long, SLES9 for pSeries will be this month I guess.
RedHat has a version for pSeries too.
We are running SLES8 currently and it works fine except for a scsi bug
with the imbsis controller caused by the 2.4 kernel, that is fixed in
the 2.6 kernel. You will have terrible disk performance in certain
situations with 2.4. So it might be worth waiting for SLES9.

Frank
