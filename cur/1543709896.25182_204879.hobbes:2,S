OK. I had just noticed that the people complaining about rmap most
are the ones using 4K page size (x86-64 uses 4K, doesn't it?). Not
that this fact means it is OK to ignore them problem, but I thought
maybe pgcl might solve it in a more general way.
I wonder how much you gain with objrmap / anobjrmap on say a 64K page
architecture?
