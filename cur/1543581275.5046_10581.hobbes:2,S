Yes. My point is that a lot of authors have declared just about everything
'volatile' `grep volatile /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/*.c`, just to
be "safe". It's likely that there are many hundreds of thousands of
unneeded register-reloads because of this. 
It might be useful for somebody who has a lot of time on his/her
hands to go through some of these drivers.
