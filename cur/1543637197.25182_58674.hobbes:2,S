I have one more question.  Is it really immaterial on the line above in
which order 'datareg' occurences are used?  Regardless of what
'OUT_BYTE' is now or may become in the future and how these macro are
used?  It looks to me that we are trying to read some byte from
'datareg', clear a bit in it and write it back but looks can be
deceptive.  It may turn out that this does or does not work on a
particular compiler whim.
Maybe it is ok now but beeing explicit in a macro definition does
not really cost anything and may save some future grief.
