Hi
I have some troubles with booting of the newest -ac Kernels (also with 2.4.19-rc3-ac5). 
Lilo prints out that I have to append the right root partition. I am sure that it's the right one. I am able to boot other Kernels (2.4.16 and 2.4.18) with the same Lilo configuration and also the same kernel configuration.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks folks!
Marc
