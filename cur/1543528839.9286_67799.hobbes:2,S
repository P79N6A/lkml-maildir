Very good. Now all you have to do is to find a passage in POSIX 1003.1
that supports or at least allows the interpretation that "foo" means
"path to cwd plus \"foo\"" (instead of "./foo"). I wish you luck ;-)
BTW, while we're at it:
Process A (user)		Process B (root)
chroot("/jail"); chdir("/");
				mount("/dev/secretstuff","/jail");
open("wargames/access-codes"); /* grr */
open("./wargames/access-codes"); /* yeah ! */
Unlikely, but certainly a lot of fun when it happens ...
