It seems everybody is busy trying Linus' sparse, so maybe it was
overlooked. Right now, it seems we have a few new tools to play with,
which were not available at the time of 2.4-test.
(Alphabetic order)
-Checker (Stanford people)
-Fscope (Carl Spalletta)
-Smatch (Dan Carpenter)
-Sparse (Linus Torvalds)
Now we only need one additional tool to *prove* correctness of the
kernel ;-)
-an automatic race finder
Liberal use of these tools should result in the most stable kernel ever.
