i cannot reproduce this build error neither with v2.6.28-rc7 nor 
with latest -git (commit f6f7b52), using your config.
could you send me your arch/x86/include/asm/smp.h file? Could 
you also double-check that you have the kernel source tree 
checked out properly? If you track it as a remote as per:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/tip.git/README
then doing "git checkout linus/master" should succeed without 
any errors beyond the warning that it is a remote branch:
 ~/tip> git checkout linus/master
 Note: moving to "linus/master" which isn't a local branch
 If you want to create a new branch from this checkout, you may do so
 (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. 
 Example:
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
 HEAD is now at f6f7b52... Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog
 ~/tip>
