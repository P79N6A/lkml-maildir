On a 4P(8-way with HT), if you run a -20 task(a simple infinite loop)
it hops from one processor to another processor... you can observe it
using top.
find_busiest_group() thinks there is an imbalance and ultimately the
idle cpu kicks active load balance on busy cpu, resulting in the hopping.

I agree with you.. But lets take a DP system with HT, now if there are
only two low priority tasks running, ideally we should be running them
on two different packages. With this patch, we may end up running on the
same logical processor.. leave alone running on the same package..
As these are low priority tasks, it might be ok.. But...
