	You can use spf to add some stateful inspection for PORT mode
ftp.  Personally, I like the masquerading option better, though.

	Stateful filter also helps block FIN scans and other stealth
scans, as well as some other esoteric attacks (fragmentation attacks,
Ping'O Death, etc...).  There are other ways to deal with those attacks
as well, but stateful filtering helps.  You also need it if you want to
take advantage of some ICMP as well.
	Big thing for me about NetFilter over IPChains, in addition to
statefull inspection, is the fact that we finally have an IPv6 aware
firewall now.  I've been chomping at the bit to get on IPv6 but
couldn't till I had working firewall code for that.
