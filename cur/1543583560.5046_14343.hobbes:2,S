Okay, then. Let's take example where I met with huge directories.
I'm working with timetables (timetab.sourceforge); at one point, I
download 100000 html files, each with one train. I'm able to deal with
that, just fine. After all, there is no structure in there. If I
wanted to add structure there, I'd have to invent some. I don't want
to. I feel just fine with 100000 files. I type its number, and it
works.
Due to kernel/nfs slowness with such huge directories, I had to split
it into several directories (each with 10000 entries). Now it gets
ugly. I was perfectly able to deal with 100000 entries, but having 10
directories is real pain.

And if there's none? Did you take a look at netscape cache? It does
hashing to workaround kernel slowness. Yes, I think it would be much
nicer if it did not workaround anything.
