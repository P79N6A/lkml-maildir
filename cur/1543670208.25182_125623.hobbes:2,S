I've looked at both apis, and think the one from David looks much better
than the old Lineo code (don't know if that has been updated in a long
time, I might not be aware of newer developments with that code.)
So, barring any unforseen pushes from the ex-Lineo developers I expect
David's code to make it into the main kernel tree eventually.
Hope this helps,
