Hi all -
     I am looking for a user-mode, interactive ACPI
interpreter under Linux. Specifically, I need to be able
to load arbitrary ACPI file(s) (AML or ASL) and then execute
the methods and see the results. If it can read from
/proc as well, so much the better.
     I have scanned the Web and the usual places, but
no luck so far.
	Thanks,
	John Worley
