I don't understand.  If a subsystem exists then it fills in its slots in
the taskstats structure, doesn't it?
No other subsystem needs a global knob, does it?
You see the problem - if one userspace package wants the tgid-stats and
another concurrently-running one does now, what do we do?  Just leave it
enabled and run a bit slower?
If so, how much slower?  Your changelog says some potential users don't
need the tgid-stats, but so what?  I assume this patch is a performance
thing?  If so, has it been quantified?
