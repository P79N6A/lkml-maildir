Yeah, I'm not strongly attached to the "new" name, although I got used
to it in glib.  The glib API is broken in lots of ways, but g_new()
and friends are nice and useful.

The number of variations can be reduced to just zeroing/nonzeroing, by
making the array length mandatory.  That's what glib does in g_new().

But that just can't be done, because kmalloc() doesn't tell us the
_intent_ of the allocation.  The allocation could be for an array, or
for a struct with a variable length string at the end, or it could be
multiple structs concatenated.  We have all sorts of weird stuff in
there that sparse would not be able to handle.
That's why alloc_struct() is better: it describes the intention exacly
"allocate the given object and return an appropriately typed pointer".
While kmalloc() just says "allocate a given sized memory chunk and
return an untyped pointer".
