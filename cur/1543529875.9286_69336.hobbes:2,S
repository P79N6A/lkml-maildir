Now, now, don't be too harsh on the resierfs guys.
Do we suddenly expect code to be bug-free before inclusion into the
kernel?
For rather obvious PR reasons I'd love to say "yes, we have a journalling
filesystem these days" as part of the 2.4.x release stuff, so it does fall
under the "drivers so cool that they might make it into 2.4.x". I don't
think I want to see the read_inode() changes, though, that's just too
ugly. I may like the PR angle of reiserfs, but that doesn't mean that I'd
forget about things like these completely.
But it looks to me as if the read_inode thing plus a few cleanups in
raiserfs to take into account that the VFS layer does more these days
would certainly make it a candidate for inclusion. Maybe not 2.4.0, but
during 2.4.x. Don't be so down on the guys, there are people who really
like actively using raiserfs..
