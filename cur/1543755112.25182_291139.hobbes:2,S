True, the compiler is free to be clever, but I still think it's best to 
write the code in the most optimal way as seen from a C perspective. 
I just took a look at the compiled object files with and without the 
patch, and it makes no difference what-so-ever - gcc generates the exact 
same code. So you are right, gcc is clever about it. 
Hmm, it's Rusty's code as far as I can see, I'll leave it up to him to 
apply the patch or not.
