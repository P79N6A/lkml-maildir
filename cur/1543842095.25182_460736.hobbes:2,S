I'm wondering why not have different processes to serve different
domains on the same physical server...particularly when they have
different database to work on.  Is the amount of memory that you save by
having a single copy that much useful that you are even okay to
serialize the whole operation (What would happen, while the request for
foo.com is getting worked on, there is another request for
foo_bar.com...does it need to wait for foo.com request to get done
before it can be served).

What is that fine grained way.  If not process based then can it be
associated with file system location?
