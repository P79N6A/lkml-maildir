If you want to talk about 2.6 then you should talk about reiser4 not 
reiserfs v3, and reiser4 is 7.6 times the write performance of ext3 for 
30 copies of the linux kernel source code using modern IDE drives and 
modern processors on a dual-CPU box, so I don't think any amount of 
improved scalability will make ext3 competitive with reiser4 for 
performance usages.  
We haven't had anyone test performance using RAID yet for reiser4, that 
could be fun.
Best,
Hans
