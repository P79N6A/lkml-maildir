That means that if you modify your string of bytes in a hex editor,
it's not a problem. But if (as in the case of firmware) you create the
strings from secret, undistributed source files, then according to the
GPL the strings are not source code. Since the source code is
unavailable, that makes them non-free. You can see where this leads...
