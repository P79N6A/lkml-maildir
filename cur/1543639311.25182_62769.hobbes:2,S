BTW, in the case of really closed resources, you just removed the "else"
case. I don't have the kernel sources at hand at the moment (still
on vacation ;) So I can't check how pci_dev is initialized on alloc,
but shouldn't we make sure the resoure pointer of the child is either
NULL or points to some properly zeroed out resource structure ?
I know the "closed resources" patch we used to have in some PPC kernel
trees did that explicitely in the "else" case here.
Ben.
