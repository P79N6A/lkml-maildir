i'm not 100% sure it's the memcpy's - but it's extract_entropy()
overhead. Might be the algorithmic slowness of SHATransform().

since this effectively disables the random driver i cannot add it to the
patch.
there's another thing you could try: various SHA_CODE_SIZE values in
drivers/char/random.c. Could you try 1, 2 and 3, does it change the
overhead as seen in the trace?
