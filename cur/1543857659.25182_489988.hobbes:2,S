good point, and argh.  good point in that any further patches that are
primarily stylistic and/or aesthetic like the above will be sent to
akpm, and CC'ed to list.
argh, in that i've already mentioned that, following the guidelines in
"SubmittingPatches", i prefer that each of my patches have one logical
purpose.  once the order of the kcalloc() args is corrected, that
would be followed by a single subsequent patch that did the
kcalloc->kzalloc transformation all at once.
if that's *not* the way folks on this list wish to see patches, then
that advice should be removed from "SubmittingPatches."
as captain hollister once said to dave lister, "choose."
