Dave,
now that i followed the thread on lk (slrn is great; thanks Jason);
I am actually interested to find out how you are going to pull what
you propose ;-> There are not that many things that will work well
with a dst-cache like idea. I actually considered the stacking idea
when i first was trying to prototype code that i posted. It is much harder
to make use of in practise. At least this is my experience.
If you look at the scheme i posted, youll see that the policy
could be to direct the packets to a IPV4-forwarding block or
totaly bypass it etc (i just didnt wanna jump into that step yet sicne it
is quiet involved architecturaly)
In any case we need to encourage people like the hipac authors to be
putting out things (i only wish theyd incorporate it into the tc
framework!); whatever changes made should consider that there is
more than one way to do things and people will always come with better
ways to do certain portions of the packet path.
cheers,
jamal
