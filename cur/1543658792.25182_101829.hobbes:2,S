No, but I can update it next week when I'm back in the office.  Should
be trivial to do; I'll pass it by Mike Stephens if he's willing,
though, since he wrote the original code I cribbed off.

Really?  Because it already exists (and is maintained by someone else)
or for some other reason?

I thought about letting archs choose which one they wanted to use, but
it would really mess up the core code.  Of course, the transition
won't break userspace (kind of the whole point of the in-kernel module
loader).
Cheers!
