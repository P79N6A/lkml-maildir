Subject: PATCH(??): linux-2.4.4/drivers/scsi/pci2220i.c referred to undefined routine scsi_set_pci_info

	linux-2.4.4 changes one line in drivers/scsi/pci2220i.c that
used to call scsi_set_pci_device to call the undefined routine
scsi_set_pci_info.  That is the only change to pci2220i.c in linux-2.4.4.
I don't know what the intention of this change was.  Perhaps a renaming
of scsi_set_pci_device is in the works, or perhaps somebody accidentally
deleted a line in an editor and decided to try typing it in from memory.
Anyhow, if reversing that change is the correct course of action, here
is a patch to that effect.
