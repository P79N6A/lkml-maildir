say we've got 100 CPUs, so we've got 100 watchdog tasks running - one 
for each CPU. Checking for hung tasks is a global operation not a 
per-CPU operation (we iterate over the global tasklist), hence only one 
CPU should really be calling this function. That online-cpus logic 
achieves this by picking a single CPU. Perhaps it would be better to 
keep a hung_task_checker_cpu variable that is driven from a 
CPU-hotplug-down notifier? That way if a CPU is brought down we can 
update hung_task_checker_cpu to another, still-online CPU. (this would 
also be faster, because event-driven)
