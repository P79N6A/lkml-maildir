Since this is brought up againg.
Today we have:
include/asm-<arch>
include/linux
include/<subsystem>
Within include/linux grep told me that "#ifdef __KERNEL__" was present
in 219 places. So a lot of header files are kept in a shape that allows
them to be included from user-land.
I see two possible solutions here:
1) Automate the process of creating sanitized user-land headers.
- It should be a trivial task to do - but will require some effort
  to be done right. Does any tool exist to do it today?
  Automation allows glibc to user kernel headers for a recent
  kernel without looking up a distribution specific set of header
  files somewhere.
  Dave M brougt up one issue the other day, when he added a new define
  to a header file. No need to wait for a distribution to pick up.
2) Create a user level hirachy under include/ [obviously 2.7 material]
include/linux/user
include/<subsystem>/user
include/asm-<arch>/user
In reality we will see a lot of files in include/linux that looks like:
sched.h:
part 1 - all relevant includes:
	#include <linux/.....>
	...
part 2 - user level interface
	#include <linux/user/sched.h>
part 3 - kernel specific definitions.
	extern rwlock_t tasklist_lock;
	extern spinlock_t mmlist_lock;
I am well aware that by default glibc shall NOT use kernel headers.
But IMHO it is too difficult to upgrate to a new version of the kernel
headers.
Care to explain what is wrong with the above approaches - I may have
missed something obvious.
