Hi,
I've just acquired a Logitech webcam and I couldn't get it to work with
the version of the PWC driver currently in the kernel. Given all the
contention about PWCX etc., are there plans to merge in the new 10.x
version of the driver available at 
http://www.saillard.org/linux/pwc/?
(This version does work with my webcam.) Just like the one in the kernel
tree right now, this version does not require pwcx at all (the binary
blob was reverse-engineered), so I think it's a big improvement.
Thanks,
