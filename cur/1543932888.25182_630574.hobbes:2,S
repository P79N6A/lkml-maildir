And what's in the upper 32 bits by default?  I'm guessing all zeroes.
We size 64-bit BARs by writing to each half individually.  So I bet this
one still overlaps the MMCONFIG space at 0xf0000000.

I don't think that's true.  If the people designing these machines had
noticed Windows failing to boot on them, they'd've fixed the BIOS to put
the MMCONFIG region elsewhere, not hacked Windows until it worked.
