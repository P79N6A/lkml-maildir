I'm pretty certain we explicitly drop the weird GNU note that
is automatically generated by gcc and specifies something informational.
Basically into .note we include *(.note.*) but not *(.note).
I don't think anything we are doing is wrong but ld gets confused easily
in the corner cases.  I'm modestly surprised we didn't have to mark our
.note.xxx scions as ".section .note.xxx @note"  or whatever the proper
gas syntax is.
