Check *BSD.

Yes. No. Yes.
It doesn't have to be mounted anywhere - we need only dentry tree and some
struct vfsmount to use path_walk(). Said vfsmount doesn't have to be anywhere
near the mount tree.
As for the "loaded in the kernel" - at that point the source of fs-related
part is ~12Kb and sysctl.c is seriously trimmed (sysctl tree traversal is
gone). Moreover, it's going to shrink more when we go for pure dcache variant.
IOW, there is no point in making it modular - no more than doing modular
CONFIG_SYSCTL in the current setup.
