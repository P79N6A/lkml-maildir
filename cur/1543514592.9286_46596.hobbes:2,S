    Greetings,
    Here I would like to submit to you a format
    that should be useful for many persons in
    France.
    This is the format of a 80's 8bits computer (TO8)
    that have been widely spreaded in schools
    10 years ago. Many emulators have been
    been writted, specially under Linux. 
    This format is known to be compatible with PC
    floppy drivers (Some applications can handle it
    , but only running DOS ). 
    I have very much experience using theses computers,
    and I know nearly everything about TO8 disk drives
    (I've disassembled ROM code), but still not enough
    to hack the kernel.
    So, is there on-line documentation about this, or
    any channel discussing about floppies ? ;-)
        If you're interrested, here is the complete format.
        This is the most common format for Thomson 
        computers. In order to write a driver very complete,
        there is 3,4 variations about it (Ex: 5''1/4 floppies).
        3''5 Disk DD (2 faces, double density).
        80 Tracks, 16 sectors per track, 256 bytes per sector.
        Track Format:
        Number        Characters    Description
        of bytes:    
        12            0x00          Synchro bit
        3             0xA1 clk 0x0A Synchro chr
        1             0xFE          Ident address id
        1             -             Number of the track
        1             -             Number of the side
        1             -             Number of the sector
        1             -             Sector Lenght
        1             -             CRC control
        22            -             Spaces
        12            0x00          Synchro bit
        3             0xA1 clk 0x0A Synchro chr
        1             0xFB          Data address id
        Sec Len       -             Data field
        2             -             CRC
        Varies        -             Spaces.
        I can eventually post by mail
        technical sheets about it (in both French/English).
        floppies formatted whit this format,
        and utilities that are running with DOS.
                            Thank you very much !
