Hate to say it, but unlike XFS which has been available for 2.4 for ages
and very well tested, DM for 2.4 has all the joy of a newly posted
feature. I really think that you will find the *if* you want DM you will
be safer going to 2.6 and using the version which has been reasonably
well tested.
You will want to do a full backup before going to a new o/s in any case,
if your data is of value.
