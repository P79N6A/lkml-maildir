More basic, less interesting but far more useful would be real aio, sicne
this would get rid of hundreds of threads that need manual killing when the
server crashes during development and keep the accept socket open ;)
(But it seems we will have sth. like that in 2.6, so I am generally happy
;)

In an ideal world, I would not need user buffers as well and could just
tell the kernel "copy from file to network", but that requires too much
kernel tinkery I believe (although, when there is generic aio in the
kernel there might some day be a aio_sendfile ;)
