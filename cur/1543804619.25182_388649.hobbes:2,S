This is not what the author intended, obviously. But I am not quite sure
what happens because of it. Seems like we unlink some things which are
about to return anyway... and then return -104 instead of -84. This
may be relatively harmless. At worst, the driver resubmits and gets
its -84 that way.
I vote to apply this and see what happens. We are early in 2.4.33 cycle,
so it should be safe.
