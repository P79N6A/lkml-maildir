According to slabinfo, it's an order-2 allocation at least on SMP-x86,
which is kind of sad. The object size is 1664 bytes, and the slab code
decides that putting two of them per page is too wasteful, so it
apparently puts 9 of them on 4 pages instead.
That does explain why it wants to dip into the low resources, but since
the VM for the last year or so tries hard to avoid allocation errors for
up to order-3 allocations the only thing that GFP_HIGH would add is to get
better latency at the cost of potentially being really nasty on the MM
balancing.
So I think it should be just GFP_KERNEL.
