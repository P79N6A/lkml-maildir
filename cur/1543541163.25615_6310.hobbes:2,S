Do you get the impression also that getting any real questions addressed is a bit difficult?  ;-)  (Still no response to my original *polite* inquiry...)  (<-- look Alan, no caps!)
My question still remains:  What is a feature, and what is a bug fix?  And what are the real criteria for making it into the kernel?  "Technical merit" is not an acceptable answer.  On "technical merit" Linux makes a horrible can opener.  (But I'm sure a salesman could sell it as such anyway...)
