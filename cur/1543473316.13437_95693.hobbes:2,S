Just a quick question:
If I compile the sound blaster driver as a module (just that, not the
general sound support or OSS) then I get an undefined symbol
mod_firmware_load trying to load sb.o.  I can fix it by manually linking
the sb module with sound_firmware.o which is made for me.  This is a
little unconvenient though as I have to make this a module since I use
isapnp.  I'm assuming this would work correctly if I made all of the sound
support a module?
