Hmm.  This doesn't really fit as my issues are very reproducible.  The
behaviour under stock Debian 2.6.8 is identical during reboots and after
fblevel 0 ; sleep X ; fblevel 15.  Likewise, stock 2.6.11, 2.6.12.4, and
2.6.13-rc5, although I'm just getting back to testing things.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so
simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is  
to make
it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.  The first  
method is
far more difficult.
