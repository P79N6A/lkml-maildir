This is not the problem at all. It's perfectly easy to write
applications that talk UTF-8 and just UTF-8 with the kernel.
The problem is that the kernel does not use UTF-8, i.e. applications in
the current linux model have to deal with the fact that the kernel
happily breaks the assumed protocol of using UTF-8 by delivering illegal
byte sequences to applications.
There is no way for applications to handle UTF-8 and illegal-utf8 in
a sane way, so most apps will either eat the illegal bytes, skip the
filename, or crash (the latter case is clearly a bug in the app, thr
former cases aren't).
Fixing the VFS to actually enforce what linus claims (2filenames are
utf-8") is a very good idea, imho.
As I understand it, the reason linux currently doesn't, is that this utf-8
rule was obviously non-enforcable in practise in recent years, since
UTF-8 simply wasn't widespread (even today, applications such as bash or
grep are clearly not UTF-8 ready, as they start to crawl in UTF-8 locales
without special patches, and even with special patches).
So the only sane way to implement this enforcement is usign an
additional moutn-flag, e.g. "force-utf8".
An encoding=xyz mount flag OTOH would be total overkill, as the plan
must be to switch to UTF-8 in the long run, while allowing deviating
behaviour in the short run.
Conversely, filesystems such as NTFS, VFAT etc. need to convert from the
fs encoding to UTF-8 and vice versa automatically, at least when this
flag is specified.
It should become the default in some future linux version.

The kernel needs to fully implement it. Just as a kernel accepting:
   open ("directory", O_WRONLY); write (dirfd, ...)...
   open ("/some/file", ...)
   mkdir ("../some/file", ...)
is considered rather broken behaviour from unix kernels (although these
might have been allowed in some dialects or versions of unix) today, this:
   mkdir ("</ encoded using illegal multibyte sequence>", ...)
will be considered broken behaviour in the future. The RFC defining UTF-8
clearly considers this a bug in UTF-8 implementations, the the kernel
in fact does NOT implement UTF-8 right now, although some people claim
that the kernel accepting UTF-8 (and more) is correct behaviour, it isn't
according to the RFC.

Microsoft and Java officially use UTF-16 nowadays. The funny thing is
that "next character" iterators in both languages skip to the next word
in UCS-2, so the claim of both parties of UTF-16 support is basically a
marketing lie.

Just that the kernel does not support UTF-8. It delivers and accepts
non-UTF-8 strings such as \xc0\x80. The kernel clearly should not deliver
broken characters when the official stanza is that the linux VFS API is
UTF-8 only (see 3.2, Chapater 3, C12, conformance, ony why it currently
isn't UTF-8).
