Interrupted - in that scheduler_tick is run, yes. They don't get switched.

Well loosely, yes. Actually, it happens if the task exists and is "running",
and has timeslice left. That only happens in scheduler_tick when the 
current
task has finished its timeslice and the priority arrays are about to be
switched. The required conditions for preemption can also occur when a task
is being woken up, (after sleeping or newly forked).

Thats right. Although I think Con or Ingo recently changed this in mm

Sounds right to me.
