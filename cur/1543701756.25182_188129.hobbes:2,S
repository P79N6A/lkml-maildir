Hello,
I agree with Stephen that the revised symlink checking code should be
added to the 2.4 series. Marcelo, could you please apply?
(The extended attribute patches contain an equivalent check, but these
patches will not get integrated into 2.4, so people switching between
vanilla 2.4 and 2.6 without this patch would run into the problems
mentioned. Because I wasn't using EA-unaware kernels much since ages, I
didn't experience this problem.)

I don't think we should. EA file systems work "well enough" on
EA-unaware kernels.

The only problem that deleting EA inodes with a non-EA-aware kernel
causes are refcounts that are too high, and a file system check will fix
this. When no FS check is done, a few file system blocks that appear to
be in use actually won't be. I think this event will be rare, so I would
not introduce a read-only flag.
