Exactly, because it's more than just the timestamps that we'd like to
grow.

Potentially, yes.  If we want to go 64-bits, then the extent maps can
take care of indirect blocks, but we would still need:
	__le32	i_blocks;	/* Blocks count */
	__le32	i_file_acl;	/* File ACL */
	__le32	i_dir_acl;	/* Directory ACL */
to get an extra 32 bits.  And there's the old favourite,
	__le16	i_links_count;	/* Links count */
which is a completely unnecessary limit on subdirs, which would be great
to eliminate at the same time.
We're not talking about a huge amount of space, here; I'd hate to
reserve too little space for the next year or so and force people to go
through a full forced fsck more than once to flag just a few more bytes
as available.

Yes, that's basically what we're already set up for with i_extra_size.
The problem is that by the time we find we can't grow the inode fields,
it may be too late.  That's especially true with timestamps: ENOSPC is a
bad return code for sys_utimes()!  It's perhaps a little more reasonable
to expect to have to deal with ENOSPC when we do a mkdir() or write().
But a per-sb reserved-inode-growth field that fsck can always set, and
that the overwhelming majority of filesystems will be able to satisfy,
simply gets rid of *all* the edge cases by guaranteeing enough space.

Not something that anyone is using right now, but it's exactly the sort
of thing that a superblock field would be ideal for.

If they really are 100% necessary for hurd, it might be that we could
relegate them to an xattr.  There's the slight problem of testing,
though; does anyone on ext2-devel actually run hurd, ever?

Setting i_extra_isize will break older e2fsprogs anyway, won't it?
e2fsck needs to have full knowledge of all fs fields in order to
maintain consistency; if it doesn't know about some of the fields whose
presence is implied by i_extra_isize, then doesn't it have to abort?
So for future-proofing, we do need some distinction between the fields
actually *used* in i_extra_isize, and those simply reserved there.  And
that has to be per-inode, if we want to allow easy dynamic migration to
newer fields.
So a per-superblock field guaranteeing that there's at least $N bytes of
usable *potential* i_extra_isize in each inode, and a per-inode
i_extra_isize which shows which fields are *actively* used, gives us
both pieces of information that we need.
