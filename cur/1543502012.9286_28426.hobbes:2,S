That would be an excellent way as it saves a lot of time for the person
who is running the script, but I think at the moment it's not possible.
Even if I could get the size of every feature (could this really be
exactly determined ?) for NOW, people tend to forget to update these
information and it would get inconsistent and useless very fast.
I wanted to do it this way: compile -> check for 'kernel to big' ->
recompile
The question is: which steps do I have to repeat: dep ? clean ?
I don't think so but is there anyone who could confirm this FOR SURE ?
By the way, I was thinking of a database or something that makes the
whole building process inclusive configuration a little bit easier. E.g.
storeing the name of the hardware component that this feature is for.
Like this many options could just be hidden and everything would be so
much easier. But it's a lot of work ... and I've got so little time ...
Anyway, thanks for your feedback.
Bye, Steffen
