Again, it would be useful to limit discussions to this universe rather
than one that contains fictions necessary to your religious views.
(Separately, hardware connecting to Tivo's network is hardly related
to why they have DRM at all, and _entirely_ unrelated to what the GPL
permits; basing your argument on that nexus is stupid, but you have
obviously given up on your previous idea that the signature is somehow
an independent work of authorship and need some -- any -- theory to
continue holding to your general faith.)

No; it means your position is at odds to fact, law and logic.  The
rest of my paragraph summarized why your argument is garbage.
Have you ever heard of the lawyer joke that if law is on your side,
you should pound the law; that if fact is on your side, you should
pound the facts; and that if neither are on your side, you should
pound the table?  You seem to be in the third state.
You suggested that Tivo's right to set terms for their network gave
them the right to modify the Linux kernel.  I twice pointed out in my
email that it did not -- that only the GPL gives them that right.  Any
right to modify the Linux kernel is inherently connected to copyright.
Kindly either refute or acknowledge that point: then this discussion
can advance.

That does not help them at all.  In fact, it is probably *worse* for
Tivo if they are intentionally withholding input to a tool, since that
is closer to the traditional idea of source code.
