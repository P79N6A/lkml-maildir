yep, at least sendmail does that (I remeber because there was a kernel
bug at some point not dropping those).
If I understand well, the basic problem is that there's no way to retain
a single capability forever through execve and everything else possible.
We'd need a way to tell the kernel a certain capability must never go
away no matter what syscall is being run. Of course one will need need a
special capability to use this functionality (CAP_ADMIN or similar) and
login/su will then be able to give IPC_CAP_LOCK to an user. I think
at some point there was something like this being discussed, when there
were still discussions about putting the capabilities into the fs (or
the elf header or whatever).
