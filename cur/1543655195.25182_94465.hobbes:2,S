Hi Linus,
Sorry about my last message (which quoted everything but didn't add 
anything).  I shouldn't try to answer email and talk on the phone at

George's Posix timers patch sets the time remaining to zero in the 
success case.  I think this is the right thing to do.  
I don't have a copy of the spec in front of me.  IIRC, it says that you have
to set the time remaining in the interrupted case.  It says nothing 
about setting it on the success case.  I would leave the lawyers out
of writing software. 
I wish the IEEE would make the Posix specs available online for free.
I gave the IEEE money for years...
