Yep, needs fixing (there are still quite a lot of these in the tree)

Erm. That went into my tree a while back, and a day or so later, into
one of Martin's IDE-5x patches.  It also went into Linus' tree a while
back. See changeset 1.513.1.14 at

Yes, it does look like a variant of this patch is missing there too.
Andre, Confirm?  Line 112 looks suspect back there. Or is 2.4 doing
different voodoo with the wcount ?
