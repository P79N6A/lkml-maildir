IMHO it's a bad idea to enable the owner of the file to avoid changing
the atime of their files.  I've heard more than once about the atime
bit being used to as proof that a user had actually seen the contents
of a file although s/he claimed s/he hadn't.  If it was root-only,
atime could still be used for the same purpose, and would enable
backups with tools that accessed the filesystem through the FS layer,
as opposed to though the block layer, to keep such proof unchanged.
