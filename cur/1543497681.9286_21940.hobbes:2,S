Linus, what do you think of the following trick:
void fput(struct file *file)
{
	if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&file->f_count))
		return;
	/* we are the sole owners */
	atomic_inc(&file->f_count);	/* to be compatible with the old
					 * variant
					 */
	[yodda, yodda]	
}
void lazy_fput(struct file *file)
{
	if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&file->f_count))
		return;
	remove_filp(file);
	file->f_next = current->goners;
	current->goners = file;
}
void reap_files(void)
{
	struct file *list = NULL;
	xchg(&list, &current->goners);
	if (!list)
		return;
	lock_kernel();
	/* for all elements of the list call locks_remove_flock(),
	 * __fput() and putting the thing on free list
	 */
	unlock_kernel();
}
in entry.S upon the return to ring 3 call reap_files(); the part before
lock_kernel() is the natural candidate for inlining, indeed.
use lazy_fput() instead of fput() in places where we know that we will
return to ring 3 soon enough.
