I heartily agree with this!!
I use two products that use out-of-tree drivers.  VMWare and NVidia cards.  
Fortunately, the build processes for both are rather painless, but there have 
been times when it has *not* been, and it was extremely frustrating.  I 
remember when VMWare was not doing a good job of supporting 2.6 kernels and I 
spent the better part of two days trying to track down a solution.  I finally 
did, but it was a third party, non-VMWare, patch to the VMWare code that 
fixed it so it would compile and run.  That's not what I consider convenience 
for the non-technical user.  A non-technical user would not have been able to 
do what I did, especially when they just want their software to work.

I want to install my machine and have everything work.  Don't make me chase 
all over the net trying to find a driver for my hardware.  If it's a network 
(i.e. ethernet device) the driver had *better* be in the tree.  Trying to 
download the driver to another computer, transferring, etc, is enough to make 
me find another brand of network card.

Latest kernel == latest driver.  No need for me to try to keep all my drivers 
up to date.

See comment about VMWare above.

I sometimes delay kernel updates because I don't want to mess with updating my 
NVidia and VMWare drivers.  This is *not* good for security.

So I did.  Please put your driver in the tree.  It will be better for all 
concerned.
