I checked several of those files as far back as 2.4.18, the oldest 
that still exists on my machine.
None of those files I checked contain any credits to anybody.  And, 
noting the last message wherein the poster quoted contrary statements 
made by SCO many years ago, I'd make the assumption that any judge 
capable of common sense would toss this, with prejudice, meaning they 
cannot change a couple of words and refile the suit.  Or at least 
thats how I understand it.  OTOH, I'm not the judge.
