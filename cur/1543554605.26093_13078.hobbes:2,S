Hi,
I have written a simple char device which allocate a page size buffer and
maps this to user-land via mmap-ing. it works if i specify MAP_PRIVATE as
flag in do_mmap but i am getting oops with MAP_SHARED flag.
i am using 2.4-test10 kernel.
attached are files.
(See attached file: char.c)code for the module.
(See attached file: mmap.c)test code.
thanks and regards,
anil
