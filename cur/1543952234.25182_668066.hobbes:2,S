Subject: [PATCH 3/5] signals: allow the kernel to actually kill /sbin/init
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/16/44

Currently the buggy /sbin/init hangs if SIGSEGV/etc happens. The kernel sends
the signal, init dequeues it and ignores, returns from the exception, repeats
the faulting instruction, and so on forever.
Imho, such a behaviour is not good. I think that the explicit loud death of
the buggy /sbin/init is better than the silent hang.
Change force_sig_info() to clear SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE when the task should be
really killed.
