Likely the only way nForce4 NCQ support could be added under Linux would
be with a closed source binary driver, and no one really wants that,
especially for storage / boot volume.  We decided it wasn't worth the
headache of a binary driver for this one feature.  Future nForce
chipsets will have a redesigned SATA controller where we can be more
open about documenting it.
