That is what 2.2 does, yes.  It does improve thing substantially.

No!

That lock is dropped as soon as the kernel stops  actively computing: it
does not get held for the whole fsync() process.

Yes.

That would help somewhat, but obviously you would have more files to
fsync so you'd lose all of your gains unless you can restrict the fsync
to just a few files.
