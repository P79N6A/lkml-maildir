Hi Doug,
    I'm not using Netscape to do the downloads of your patches. I used
lynx and saved the file to disk. Anyhow, I've tried to breakdown and
list a few things that should be taken care of along with my test results
in items (A-F).
A). I've tried patching the 2.2.15pre5  kernel with your
   aic7xxx-5.1.24.patch  and get the following patch errors below
   that I mentioned in yesterdays email. If I patch then with
   aic7xxx-5.1.25.patch file on top of the 5.1.24.patch in spite of
   the patch errors I don't get a any patch errors for 5.1.25's patch.
   Thus, I think the 2.2.15pre5 patch and now the 2.2.15pre6 patch
   for scsi's should be corrected if one uses these "pre" patches.
   Here is the patch error list:
patching file `drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.seq'
patching file `drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.reg'
patching file `drivers/scsi/aic7xxx.c'
Hunk #30 FAILED at 10592.

    Here is the "rej" file.

B). Based on your suggestion of patching the linux kernel 2.2.14
   with your patches: aic7xxx-5.1.22.patch, 5.1.23, 5.1.24, 5.1.25
   it will patch without problems. I then recompiled this kernel 
   and rebooted.  IT BOOTED WITH SUCCESS! for Narrow Channel B
   without problems. Hey! this is great service. :)   So I guess
   the solution is the one provided by "Ben Herrenschmidt".
   So need to fix the "pre" patch problems in item (A) for Alan Cox.
C). Is there any way to eliminate the other udelay() calls? Note:
   one udelay() comment says "1 msec" meaning one millisec whereas the
   udelay() means 1 microsec. Thus, the comment should say /* 1 usec */.
   I guess the msec() routines probably can't be eliminated.
    udelay(1000);
      udelay(50);
            udelay(1);
              udelay(1);
            udelay(1);
              udelay(1);
      udelay(1);           /* Do nothing */                          \
  udelay(1);
  udelay(1);
  udelay(1);
    udelay(1);  /* 1 msec */
D). Although item(B) works now, still need to fix the "data-overrun"
   error that you responded to in an earlier email.

E). Here are some "make bzImage" and "make module" warnings I'm getting.
    Some of them are "SCSI" and should be cleaned up if possible so that
    one gets clean compiles. The others belong to other people.
    Perhaps Alan Cox could forward to the respective people.
    Note: I'm using gcc v1.0.3.
