I knew it. ;-)

Let's see, if I got this right. You mean that on such a platform, where 0 is a 
valid physical IRQ, we should assign another value as virtual IRQ number (not 
0 and not -1 of course). And then the platform "pic" implementation should 
take care of the remapping of these virtual IRQ numbers to the physical 
numbers.
Correct?
