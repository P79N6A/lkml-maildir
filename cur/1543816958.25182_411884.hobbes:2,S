I really wonder why it's the call from do_exit() that triggers it.
The thing is, we get off-by-exactly-one here and all previous callers
of that puppy would be elsewhere (cfq, mostly).
IOW, we get exactly one extra call of put_io_context() _and_ have it
happen before do_exit() (i.e. from normal IO paths).  Interesting...
Is there any way to reproduce it without too much PITA?
