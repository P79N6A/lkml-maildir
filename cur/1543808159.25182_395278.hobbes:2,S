I like the idea of the patch, but the code looks a bit too complicated
IMO. What is wrong with using vmalloc() to allocate a virtual
contiguous range of 0-order pages (one bit per page), and then use the
functions in linux/bitmap.h...? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.
A system that has 2 GB RAM and 4 KB pages would use 64 KB per bitmap
(one bitmap per node), which is not so bad memory wise if you plan to
use all bits.
OTOH, if your plan is to use a single bit here and there, and leave
most of the bits unused then some kind of tree is probably better.
Or does the kernel already implement some kind of data structure that
never consumes _that_ much more space than a bitmap when fully used,
and saves a lot of memory when just sparsely populated?
