Looks like a locking bug.

Sigh.  That's exactly the info we wanted.  Please try 2.6.9-rc3-mm1 which
should have that fixed.  Or wait 15 minutes for 2.6.9-rc3-mm2.
Then do the sysrq-P trace again.  You may need to type it a few times.  If
you manage to get a backtrace of the process which is stuck in spin_lock,
that's the info we want.
You may find that all CPUs are stuck in spin_lock().  If so, please send
each CPU's backtrace.  If you have to type it all in, don't worry about the
eight-digit hex numbers.
