OK, I missed that, thanks.

The bug that I've been fighting in my own kernel is a memory leak. So I
started looking into this at what would happen in verious places if an
allocation didn't work.
In create_dir:
		error = sysfs_make_dirent(p->d_fsdata, *d, k, mode, SYSFS_DIR);
// Above is where the entry is added to the parent link list.
		if (!error) {
			error = sysfs_create(*d, mode, init_dir);
// If sysfs_create fails to allocate an inode, when below
// does the element get removed from the parent?
			if (!error) {
				p->d_inode->i_nlink++;
				(*d)->d_op = &sysfs_dentry_ops;
				d_rehash(*d);
			}
		}
		if (error && (error != -EEXIST)) {
			sysfs_put((*d)->d_fsdata);
// sysfs_put only seems to handle the kobject portion
			d_drop(*d);
// d_drop handles the unhash
		}
		dput(*d);
So I'm not sure an error from sysfs_create will remove the object from the
link list.  In fact, it might be worst since now there's an object on the
link list that may no long even be an object.
I'll test this by forcing a failure at sysfs_create.
