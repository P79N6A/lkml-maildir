Actually, I've always had a problem like this on 2.0.x. I have a
64-node cluster, and I frequently run scripts which fork 128 processes
at a time. These scripts occasionally get 'cannot fork', with no
resource starvation evident... I wrote some test programs but wasn't
able to get a nice, repeatable behavior.
