Subject: [PATCH 0/79] smpboot integration

Hi,
This is a complement to my last patch series. In this one, I integrate smpboot.c
The end result is that i386 also uses the new hotplug state machine, and boot cpus
via cpu_up, instead of booting them in the preparation step, and only activating later.
The final diffstat says:
 59 files changed, 1974 insertions(+), 2752 deletions(-)
Leftovers:
smp.h could also be easily integrated. But this series was too big already
setup64.c could also be completely moved to setup.c
Testing and bisectability:
The end result was tested in all my hardware (which includes qemu ;-). 
It does not mean it will boot _your_ hardware, but I did my best ;-)
The tree at least compiles in more than 20 randconfigs (for each of x86_64 and i386)
For i386, each of the subarchitectures was compiled at least once. (By compile, I obviously
mean, every patch, individually)
