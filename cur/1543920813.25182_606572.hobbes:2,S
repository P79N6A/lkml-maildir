People regularly report speeds higher than that on the RAID list, and I 
can get that order of magnitude speed using dd with 1MB buffers to a 
software RAID-0 array or cheap SATA drives. Are you using a decent 
controller? Many "RAID" controllers have bandwidth limitations, buffer 
size issues, etc. I had some chea "SCSI" arrays which were just SCSI 
controllers in from of a bunch of cheap, slow, non-SCSI drives.

I would limit the write size to a MB and see if that helps, regardless 
of the buffer size. A circular queue of smaller buffers, like ptbuf, may 
perform better.

I don't think it would help, I'd really try limiting the size of the 
write() calls first, assuming your hardware is adequate.
