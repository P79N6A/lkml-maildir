After upgrading from kernel 2.0.32 to 2.1.131,
I get the following error messages when I run fdisk:
mail1:/home/aw# fdisk -l /dev/sda |head -20
Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 528 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

Partition 1 has different physical/logical beginnings (non-Linux?):
     phys=(0, 1, 1) logical=(0, 0, 33)
Partition 1 has different physical/logical endings:

Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(49, 63, 32) should be (49, 254, 63)
