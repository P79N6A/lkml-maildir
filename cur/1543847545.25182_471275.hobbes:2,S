I'm curious how you produced this for all architectures?  Did you
write up a script to so something trivial like
    for i in $LINUX_DIR/arch/*; do
	make ARCH=$(basename $i) INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/tmp/foo headers_install;
    done
or did you do something more complicated and interesting?  If so,
would you mind sharing?
