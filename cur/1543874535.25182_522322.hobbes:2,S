I don't know that you need an xchg there. If you're still on the same
CPU, it should all be nice and causal even across an interrupt handler.
So it could be:
   pda.intr_mask = 0; /* intr_pending can't get set after this */
   if (unlikely(pda.intr_pending)) {
      pda.intr_pending = 0;
      asm("sti");
   }
(This would actually need a C barrier, but I'll ignore that as this'd
end up being asm...)
But other interesting things could happen. If we never did a real CLI
and we get preempted and switched to another CPU between clearing
intr_mask and checking intr_pending, we get a little confused. 
But perhaps that doesn't matter because we'd by definition have no
pending interrupts on either processor?
Is it expensive to do an STI if interrupts are already enabled?
