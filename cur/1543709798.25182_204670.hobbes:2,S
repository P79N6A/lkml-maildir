It's better with this option, hdparm works now. Thanks a lot.
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 58140/16/63, sectors = 58605120, start = 0
But I still have a problem of latency when the disk seems starting after
about 30 sec of inactivity. It's strange. I don't find any disk option
in the ACPI configuration entries. Or perhaps it's the 
ACPI_SLEEP experimental option. I'll try without it.
