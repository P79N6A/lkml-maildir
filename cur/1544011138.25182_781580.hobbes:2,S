Thank you.
It looks like most of cached pages were successfully freed:
        247788 => 69856 pages
To get more concrete numbers, could you send more info by running the
following commands?
cp /proc/meminfo meminfo-1
cp /proc/vmstat vmstat-1
sync
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
cp /proc/meminfo meminfo-2
cp /proc/vmstat vmstat-2
Thanks,
