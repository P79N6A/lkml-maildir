He isn't, he quoted the ANSI C standard. Its the same rule that allows you
to do:
x = y = z;
If Richard were correct then x would be TRUE or FALSE depending on the
assignment of y = z working, i.e. TRUE. BTW this is almost what PL/1 does
with the same statement !

Amen brother.

In some circumstances Lint has to be ignored. It is the sign of a skilled
developer who knows when Lint is talking bollocks, as a result of its
fevered imagination. The use of:
if (a = b)
is often a problem with newbies as almost every other language uses this
as the format of an equality test. Many people on learning C forget and
use this instead. If this were not such a common problem then both GCC and
Lint probably wouldn't flag it up. The problem is that when used by
someone who knows what they are talking about, they have to put up with
this newbie trap warning.

Even Microsoft agrees with you. The test program was different but it
was testing the same rule.

I suggest this conversation should be moved to comp.lang.c.
