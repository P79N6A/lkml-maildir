I agree it is possible, I disagree that it should be nessasary. For
E-commerce sites you will find that the number of cgi's can end up much
larget than you would expect from normal web site statistics. I will let
this drop now as it appears that this is not going to be an option.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
