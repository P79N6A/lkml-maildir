Ah ha! But then look again  at my 16-bit example, an expert assembly
langauge programmer will use a 32 bit load if efficiency is not an
issue (and it does not matter if there are extra bits around), but
a 16-bit load if the hardware for some reason requires it. How is
the poort C compiler to distinguish these cases automatically?
