Well, I just found out about latencytop a couple of days ago when Arjan
announced it. I took a quick look and it seems to be more of a general
collection of information. This tracer pinpoints out specific maxes.
Although I may be wrong (I have to admit, I haven't had the time to really
look at what LatencyTop does, but I have been using this tracer in -rt for
a number of years).
As for using markers, I just piggied back on top of lockdep, since it has
the same hooks that I needed. If we were to replace them with markers,
then I would say lockdep should use the markers too.
One thing about markers, only one probe may be allowed at a time. Perhaps
we should fix this by using something like I did with the mcount hook.
