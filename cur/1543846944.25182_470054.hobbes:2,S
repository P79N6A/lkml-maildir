Well, I know several old 2.4 netfilter systems running around and which
process between 100 and 200 millions of sessions a day with peak hours
around 4000 sessions/s. They might have been rebooted twice in 3 years,
and they still work without a glitch. So I clearly don't think that the
problem mentionned above is present in plain 2.4. It might be a very
old bug in you rather old kernel, or one specific to some patches in
your distro's kernel (BTW, I would be surprized you wouldn't find
anything more recent than 2.4.17).
Best regards,
Willy
