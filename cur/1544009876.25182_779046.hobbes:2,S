Ahh, indeed. That ends up doing setup_local_APIC() in smp_callin().
I wonder if we should do that from apic_resume() too - instead of saving 
any state we could probably just re-initialize it.
The setup_local_APIC() function also seems to be a lot more careful than 
"resume_apic()" is about ordering (well, at least it has _comments_ on the 
ordering), and it does things like ack'ing all pending irq's.
Hmm.
