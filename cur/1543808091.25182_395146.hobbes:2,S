Do you know how incomplete this patch is?

You missed drivers/char/drm, and in your shipping OpenVZ patch.
You missed get_xpid() on alpha.
You missed nfs.
All it seems you have found is the low hanging fruit where pids are used.
Without compile errors to help I don't know how you are ever going to find
everything, especially with the kernel constantly changing.
Honestly this approach looks like a maintenance nightmare, you didn't
even correctly handle all of the interfaces you posted in you patch.
I suspect the tagging of the VPIDS and the WARN_ON's help so you have
a chance of catching things if someone uses a code path you haven't
caught.  But I don't see how you can possibly get full kernel
coverage.
Is there a plan to catch all of the in-kernel use of pids that I am
being to dense to see?

You missed cap_set_all.
