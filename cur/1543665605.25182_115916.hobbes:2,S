Hello!
   Looking at fs/ncpfs/ioctl.c (latest 2.4 bk tree), I seem to see a place
   where we use userspace-pointers directly (And eventually doing kfree on
   these). In NCP_IOC_SETOBJECTNAME handler, we allocated space (newname
   pointer), copy stuff from userspace to there and then assign userspace
   pointer to our internal structure, whoops! Or am I missing something?
   Seems that following patch is needed. (Same problem is present in 2.5
   and same patch should apply)
   Found with help of smatch + enhanced unfree script.
Bye,
    Oleg
