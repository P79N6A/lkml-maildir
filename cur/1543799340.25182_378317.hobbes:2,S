I've sent the above info, but there is a nilmreg here someplace.  I'm 
currently booted to 2.6.15-rc6, and both sensors, and gkrellm are 
working fine.
And, FWIW, so apparently is ntpd......
One of those things that make you go 'Hummmm'.
Uptime now about 30 minutes, no messages in the log and the toolbar 
clock is staying about 4 seconds behind my watch.
Anybody got any nilmerg spray?  Looks like I need a gallon. :(
