Full ack.
Especially if there was some kind of "pre-merge linux-next freeze" where 
people (arch maintainers, kernel testers) would be actively invited to do 
pre-merge testing.
During that period only changes that fix reported issues (be it build issues 
or regressions) would be allowed:
- either a revert of the problematic commit
- or a targeted fix
This could even hugely improve the bisectability of mainline after the merge 
as such changes could be merged/rebased into the subsystem tree _before_ 
Linus pulls them into mainline.
Currently I avoid -next and -mm and I also don't do any merge window 
testing. Why? Too much flux, too many issues, too much energy required.
But if there was some sort of pre-merge call for testing of an identifiable 
and relatively stable tree, I would definitely participate in that and be 
willing to spend time to bisect the hell out of any issues I'd find.
Cheers,
FJP
