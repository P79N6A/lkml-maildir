Yep, this is what we tried to do last week.
It failed, and the patch was reverted.
I agree, the BIOS vendor can lie with ACPI tables.
In particular, they can map any hardware C-state
to any ACPI C-state. Our expectation that they
would not map hardware C3 to ACPI C2
appears at this point to have been invalid.
So, speaking for Intel parts, every single one that supports
HW C3 from the beginning of history through today has a broken
LAPIC timer.  (and a few listed in that patch are known to
be broken in HW C2)   If we can't guarantee that the BIOS vendor
will not map that broken HW C3 to ACPI C2 (or even C1 via SMM)
then we have to not use the LAPIC timer except for systems with
a "known-good" signature = "part supports only C1".
If we really care about using the LAPIC timer on systems with deeper
than C1 support, the only alternative seems to be to test
if it actually works or not at boot and run-time.
Otherwise, we wait for future hardware with guaranteed
not to break under any (BIOS) conditions ships, and check for that.
Based on what I read of the HP nx6325 where the LAPIC timer
is breaking C1, AMD is in the same boat.
