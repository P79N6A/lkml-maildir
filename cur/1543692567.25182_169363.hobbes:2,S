At least for pushes of segment registers a 486 decrements
the stack pointer by 4 but only writes the 2 least significant
bytes, leaving garbage in the upper half. 
That's documented in the list of differences between 486 and Pentium.
It may be different for the frame pushed on the stack during interrupt
entry; my take on it is that it is inherently dangerous to rely
on the upper 16 bits being zero.
Just my 2 cents,
