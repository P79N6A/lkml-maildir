Hi Mauro,
    You've been working on cx88 for a long time.  Can I ask you
something?  I have a cx88 based card and I tried to get audio coming
from "Line In" of my card.  However, it seems like the audio always
comes from TV input.   I looked into the code and it seems like
VIDIOC_S_AUDIO is not working in cx88.  Can you help please?
Thanks.
