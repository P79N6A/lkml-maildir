    Hi all :)
    Where should I look if I want to know which ANSI escape codes (or
any other escape codes) the console accepts? I know that I can send
ESC[1m; to the console for getting bold text, for example, and I know
more codes, extracted from the terminfo entries and places like that,
but I would like to know if somewhere in the sources is something
like a list of supported codes.
    Thanks a lot in advance.
