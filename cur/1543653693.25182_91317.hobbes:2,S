Indeed, rmdir should probably also remove the control file.

The system calls are only a temporary solution, so skipping security hooks 
is no real loss. :)

module_dir->module is an optimization to get quickly to the module file 
created by sys_create_module(). module_data->module is the pointer to the 
real module data.

As the system calls are only temporary, they don't have to be perfect, but 
why should it return -ENOINT, AFAICS it should fail for other reason.
Anyway, the module state management needs a overhaul, this is just a 
copy&paste from the old code.
