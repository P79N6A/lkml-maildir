Hi,
I've just noticed in 2.4.19, that:
"Support for PCMCIA management for PC-style ports" appears twice in the configuration.
I didn't notice it in 2.4.19-RC2, (the last version I compiled), but I might have missed it.
By the way, I got a 2.4.18 tree, patched it to RC1, then used the incremental patches up to -final.
The second instance is greyed-out in xconfig, and neither allows y, m or n to be selected.
John.
