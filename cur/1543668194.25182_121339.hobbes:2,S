I have the same "double root":
# cat /proc/mounts 
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext3 rw 0 0
[...]
# ls -las /dev/root
   0 lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            4 Mar 22 15:07 /dev/root -> md/0
# ls -als /etc/mtab
   1 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          345 Mar 23 15:55 /etc/mtab
# cat /etc/mtab
/dev/md0 / ext3 rw 0 0
[...]
could it be a 'feature' of devfs, or maybe of raid devices ?
kernel version is 2.4.21-pre5-ac3
