Does iptables have or allow IP Masqurading?  This is really what I'm trying
to do as I have a network behind my linux server (acting as a router) and
need to forward packets from 192.168.0.x to my WAN port on the same Linux
server.  I had this working with ipchains until the upgrade to 2.4.18.
Thanks,
Kirk

In the new kernels ipchains is not included by default (probably if you put
some effort you can include it.).
There is an alternate for ipchains is available called iptables, with which
you should be able to do most of the things you expect from ipchains.
