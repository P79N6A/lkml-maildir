Please refer to my other messages regarding the true purposes of the
tree-based bootmem and so on.
Given that it's one architecture, a single very small machine, and one
kernel version, this is perhaps not as scientific as I'd like it to be,
but my personal computer (i386) at home shows the following results for
2.4.17-rc2 and my local patch set (plus or minus bootmem).
2.4.17-rc2-wli-bootmem:
Memory: 769332k/786368k available
	(1389k kernel code, 16648k reserved, 1019k data, 224k init, 0k highmem)
2.4.17-rc2-wli:
Memory: 769340k/786368k available
	(1389k kernel code, 16640k reserved, 1019k data, 216k init, 0k highmem)
After freeing init, the total memory is identical, not my expected 8KB:
