iozone and bonnie are two well established benchmarks.
Multiple versions of diskbench (aka "db") are also good.
"spew" is a new kid on the block but easy to use.
Hrm...looks like debian dropped iozone from the next release.

google is your friend. :)
google can lead to to all of the above if you don't have
debian (ie "apt-get install bonnie++ spew").
Note that having a bench marking tool is just half the battle.
Knowing _what_ the result means is the other half.
