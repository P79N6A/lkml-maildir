Thinking about this more. Of the Linux users I asked, they think a kernel
panic is a bug in the kernel anyway (or at least something in the kernel
went wrong).  So if panics will point users to the kernel anyway, then why
leave out possible vital information from those panics that were caused by
an actual kernel bug.
