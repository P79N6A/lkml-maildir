Ah I see. A Domain-OS like // root which is different from /.
In Domain-OS, a cd / brough you to the root dir of the current
UNIX file system, and cd // brough you to a "super-root" that
had:
//localhost		"/" of local machine
//otherhost		"/" of "otherhost" (domain-os type remote fs)
I think Richard here means that there should be a //proc and //shm
that are rooted at // but _not_ at / (and /proc should be a symlink
to //proc for backwards compatibility). This way, the root file
system is not cluttered up at all, but cleaned up. //proc and //shm
would be mounted automatically by the kernel.
Hmm, and this way changing the root filesystem would be trivial-
cd //
mv unix-root oldroot
mkdir unix-root
mount /dev/hda3 //unix-root
.. or something similar
It would take quite a bit of changes in VFS though, I think
Mike.
