Indeed, this is not addressed, though it may sense to have
a way in the device model to call the suspend/resume callbacks
of "childs" of a given hub only for that purpose, I don't think
this is implemented yet. Maybe talk to Patrick about it.
In general "local" power management (automatic disk spin down,
chipset idle-pm, etc...) is ... local to the driver, though you
can probably use the power state field of struct device to
store your current state if it maps to those semantics.
