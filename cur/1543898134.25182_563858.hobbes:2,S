As Auke said, maintaining the information in MAINTAINERS would be 
better.
And another important use case that shouldn't require much extra work 
would be to do the same for bug reports.
Generally, you should keep in mind that it must fit into the workflow of 
the people who should use it. E.g. I could imagine that it might make 
more sense if you write a small tool that takes a patch or a path and 
outputs email addresses instead of a huge tool that tries to solve too 
many problems at once and doesn't fit into the workflow of most people.
