It is 640 lines.

I said "configfs" in the email to which you are replying.

Configfs has a per-item release method.  Configfs has a group open method.  
What is it that configfs can't do, or can't be made to do trivially?

The model you came up with for dlmfs is beyond cute, it's downright clever.  
Why mar that achievement by then failing to capitalize on the framework you 
already have in configfs?
By the way, do you agree that dlmfs is too inefficient to be an effective way 
of exporting your dlm api to user space, except for slow-path applications 
like you have here?
