Yes indeed - on my quad CPU Red Hat 7 server, I accidentally
forgot to say CC=kgcc during the last kernel build, and ended
up with a gcc-2.96 built kernel. I decided to let it run and see
what happens - It's been up and running -test12 for about 20
days now, solid as a rock.
My home system, an AMD k6, likewise is very very happy
running 2.4.0-prerelase compiled with gcc 2.96
