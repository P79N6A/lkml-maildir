So you mean energy (measured in J).
Power is energy/time unit (measured in W, i.e. J/s).
So I guess what you really want to say is: throttling decreases power
consumption, but on modern CPUs it increases the amount of energy needed
to perform the task.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
