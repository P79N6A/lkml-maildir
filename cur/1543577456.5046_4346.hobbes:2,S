This is *exactly* why Alan's policy change makes sense.
If somebody submits a driver bugfix or update for 2.2,
but not for 2.4, it'll take FOREVER for 2.4 to become
as "trustable" as 2.2...
This change, however, will make sure that 2.4 will be
as reliable as 2.2 much faster. Unlike 2.2, the core
kernel of 2.4 is reliable ... only the peripheral stuff
like drivers may be out of date or missing.

Rik
