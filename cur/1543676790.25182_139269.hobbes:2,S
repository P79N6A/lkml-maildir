I now tried rc7+aic20030603 SMP apic _but_ interrupts from aic only bound to
single cpu. I did this with help of irqbalance from Arjan.
/proc/interrupts:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:       5148     571297    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       9733         97    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade

 15:          4          4    IO-APIC-edge  ide1

The controller used is the second aic7xxx. The 31 interrupts on CPU0 have
occured before the test. This setup fails during verify (data corruption).
I would say that the interrupt code of the aic in itself is therefore ok with
SMP. If it were a SMP race condition inside the interrupt routine this test
should have been ok (as only one CPU is used).
