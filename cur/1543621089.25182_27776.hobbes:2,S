The bttv we can argue about, I was just tagging it as beeing a quick fix...
Of course I admit that I have taken the easy shoot here. But it wasn't 
possible
to me to deduce the proper thing to do by looking at the patches.
This is the usual way I deal with API changes: Have a look at what has 
been done
to the other candidates and do the analogous thing where you need it.
But please just show me a non x86 architecture which is using the 
i810_audio driver!
