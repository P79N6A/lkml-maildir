I saw the same thing yesterday, also on an amd64 box though that
could be coincidence. The kswapd1 process was pegging the cpu at 99%
kswapd0 was idle.  After a few minutes, the box became so unresponsive
I had to reboot it.
I had put this down to me fiddling with some patches, and it hasnt'
reappeared today yet, but it sounds like we're seeing the same thing.
Sadly, I didn't get a profile of what was happening.
A 'make allmodconfig' triggered it for me, on a box with 2GB of ram,
and 2GB of swap. No swap was in use when things 'went wierd', and
there was a bunch of RAM sitting free too (about half a gig if memory
serves correctly)
