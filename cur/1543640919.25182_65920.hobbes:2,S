I can see all those messages, too. A lot of tasks (if not all)
seems to exit with a "note: task[PID] exited with preempt_count 1"
The kernel I'm using is 2.4.19-ck2-rmap from Con Colivas
wich can be found at 
http://kernel.kolivas.net
It's a plain 2.4.29 + 
sched-2.4.19-rc2-A4
preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.19-rc5-3.patch
2.4.19-low-latency.patch
2.4.19-rmap14a or 2.4.19-rc5aa1 05_vm_* (rmap in my case)
