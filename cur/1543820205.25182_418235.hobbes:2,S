Heh, that was just my question to Crispin this morning, because that's
what I'd prefer too.
Not just for security, but simply because experience shows that error
paths are not well auditted in general; even if it doesn't cause
privilege escalation, I prefer if it doesn't shred the data it is
allowed to access by hitting a misconfiguration in my profile...
