This is the same problem I'm seeing (See Subject: Regression in 2.6.22,
clock problems on Turion with 32-bit kernel).
This commit is what we bisected to:

    [PATCH] clockevents: i386 drivers
    Add clockevent drivers for i386: lapic (local) and PIT/HPET (global).  Update
    the timer IRQ to call into the PIT/HPET driver's event handler and the
    lapic-timer IRQ to call into the lapic clockevent driver.  The assignement of
    timer functionality is delegated to the core framework code and replaces the
    compile and runtime evalution in do_timer_interrupt_hook()
    Use the clockevents broadcast support and implement the lapic_broadcast
    function for ACPI.
    No changes to existing functionality.
