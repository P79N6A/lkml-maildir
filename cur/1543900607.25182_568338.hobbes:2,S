Partial answer: -10 didn't help with v16, I'll try more boost ASAP, but 
power has been spotty in upstate NY, 20k+ customers with none and the 
rest of us subject to "load shedding" with zero warning, and the test 
machines have UPS but no generator, so I hesitate to use them while 
power is unstable.

Will do, you suggested dropping sched_granularity_ns to 1000000 earlier, 
and that didn't do it, but I didn't change the wakeup, and will test 
these values later today.
