i just ran various benchmarks on an 8-way (8x 700 MHz Xeon, 4GB RAM):
      AVG      v2.6.24.slab     v2.6.24.slub         [ smaller is better ]
   -----------------------------------------
            mmap:   1052.66          1049.33   (  0%)
           ctx-2:      4.32             4.30   (  0%)
          select:     41.95            43.69   (  4%)
       proc-exec:    394.45           391.92   (  0%)
    hackbench-10:      1.12             2.99   (166%)
    hackbench-20:      2.04             6.67   (226%)
    hackbench-50:      5.03            17.50   (247%)
and hackbench overhead stands out, by a huge margin. Other stuff is 
within measurement noise. Neither SLUB nor SLAB debugging was turned on, 
all other debugging options were off too.
