Subject: [QUESTION] omit adler32 in zlib

Hello,
zlib deflate generates an adler32 checksum for the input uncompressed 
data. In order to gain some drop of performance we would like not to 
generate/check adler32 because we anyway protect our data by much stronger 
CRC32.
How to correctly do that?
My quick investigation has shown that it is possible if I pass the a 
negative windowBits parameter to the deflateInit2() function to achieve 
the goal. But this feature isn't noted in the deflate API description 
(include/linux/zlib.h) and is called "undocumented feature" in 
lib/zlib_deflate/deflate.c.
So the question is: is it OK to use this undocumented feature? What are 
alternatives?
I also noted that if I use  deflate via crypto API, I'll get what I want 
since it does:
#define DEFLATE_DEF_WINBITS             11
ret = zlib_deflateInit2(stream,
	DEFLATE_DEF_LEVEL,
	Z_DEFLATED,
	-DEFLATE_DEF_WINBITS,
	DEFLATE_DEF_MEMLEVEL,
	Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY);
(note the "minus" character before DEFLATE_DEF_WINBITS)
I'm curious why crypto API omits adler32 by default?
Thanks.
