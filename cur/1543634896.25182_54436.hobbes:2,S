Hello,
I have an ASUS P4S533 motherboard with the sis645dx chipset. I need agpgart support for dri to work correctly, so in my kernel I enabled agpgart support (made the /dev entry) and enabled Generic SiS Chipset support under it.
When my kernel boots up it complains "Unsupported SiS chipset (device id: 0646), you might want to try agp_try_unsupported=1. no supported devices found."
Is the 645dx chipset completely unsupported? It is fairly popular. I believe it uses the same agp controller as the regular sis 645. Is that unsupported as well?
btw, I am using kernel 2.4.18
Thanks,
Kareem
