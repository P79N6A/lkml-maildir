The line you refer to here is, I believe, in include/linux/cpumask.h:
  #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
    ...
  #else
    ...
  #define cpu_online(cpu)    ({ BUG_ON((cpu) != 0); 1; })
    ...
  #endif
Any thoughts on whether that BUG() is serving any useful purpose?
I'm of a mind to have the non-SMP case of cpu_online(cpu) simply
respond true (1) hardcoded:
  #define cpu_online(cpu)    (1)
Or at least remove the BUG and have it respond true iff cpu == 0:
  #define cpu_online(cpu)    ((cpu) == 0)
While theoretically correct, that BUG() is, so far as I know, of
no redeeming social value.  And it wastes a few bytes of kernel
text space each time cpu_online() is used on an SMP, and causes
the occassional confusion, as in this case.
