A temporary-for-years flag is not a good approach.  The flag is not 
_needed_ for technical reasons, but for supposed user expectation reasons.
Rather, just go ahead and convert drivers to netdev_alloc_skb() where 
people care.  If someone suddenly gets a burr up their ass about the 
sunlance or epic100 driver deadlocking on NBD, then they can convert it 
or complain loudly themselves.
Overall, a good solution needs to be uniform across all net drivers. 
NETIF_F_MEMALLOC is just _encouraging_ people to be slackers and delay 
converting other drivers, creating two classes of drivers, the "haves" 
and the "have nots".
Just make a big netdev_alloc_skb() patch that converts most users. 
netdev_alloc_skb() is a good thing to use, because it builds an 
association with struct net_device and the allocation.

P.S.  Since netdev_alloc_skb() calls skb_reserve(), you need to take 
that into account.  That's a bug in current patches.
