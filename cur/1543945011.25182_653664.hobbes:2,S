With the caveat that I currently have not digested your patch series, this sounds like a reasonable approach.  The root-domain effectively represents the top sched-domain anyway (with the additional attribute that its a shared structure with all constituent cpus).
Ill try to take a look at the series later today and get back to you with feedback.
