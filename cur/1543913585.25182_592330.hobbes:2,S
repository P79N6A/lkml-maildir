That's easy to fix:  just change the SCSI heading to include a libata hint.
Something like this:
[PATCH] libata Kconfig: Allow libata to be selected from within the SCSI submenu
Move libata Kconfig sourcing from the drivers Kconfig into the SCSI Kconfig,
and change the SCSI menu heading to indicate libata submenu inclusion.
This allows the user to quickly select additional disk/tape/cdrom support 
from within the same menu.
