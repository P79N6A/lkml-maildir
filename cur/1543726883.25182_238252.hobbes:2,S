Sending me emails with the patches is fine for me.  Feel free to
automate it if you want to, that would really help out.
Do we have a way for patches to flow back into sf.net.  I remember we
had some "line too long" warnings that we had to fix up by hand in that
file that probably didn't make it upstream.
I'll go grab the latest version of the patch on your site to add to my
bk-pci tree right now...
