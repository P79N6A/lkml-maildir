Probably, this is a VT-d bug. I saw the same bug report before:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/9/8/138
it's worth trying the latest kernel but I guess that the problem still
exists.
As Mark suggested, it's also worth trying 'intel_iommu=strict' kernel
boot option, I think. If it doesn't work, you can use a workaround to
disable VT-d with 'intel_iommu=off' kernel boot option.
