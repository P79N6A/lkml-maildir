It is solid - I did not just invent that approach, it was how we have
always done it until around 2.5.6-pre (Ingo sent a patch to change it). 
The 2.4 patches do it this way (take a look) and 2.5 before the change
obviously worked like this.
It hasn't shown any problems in ~6 months of use.
I'll cook up a patch to do it, but I'd like to hear Linus opinion ...
