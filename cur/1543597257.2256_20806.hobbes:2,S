No. Hibernation can be done (see sw_susp patches). This is per-process
-> different. And you could implement that "live upgrade" similar
way. Checkpoint all. Reboot with new kernel. Restart all. That's close
enough to live upgrade.
(Ouch, what are you going to do with programs that behave differently
on different kernel releases? What if you have X using some kernel
driver that goes away in new release?)
