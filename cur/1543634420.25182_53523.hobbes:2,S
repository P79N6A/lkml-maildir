My UP CPU number optimisation patch, from which this originates,
made the set_${foo}_cpu() inline 'void'. If for some reason a
return value is needed, just return 0 since that's what the
optimised-away "->cpu = 0" assignment would have had as value.
(The difference is that I had foo=thread_info, but Ingo lifted it
up so foo=task_struct here. I also removed the x86 thread_info cpu
field on UP.)
