OK, that makes things clearer. In addition to that, I also found that
2.2.15 fixes some things wrt the CS5530 controller chip. So I'll try both
things: a newer kernel (2.2.16 is in the SuSE upgrades) _and_ the append
parameter.
And BTW: Isn't Andre's writing style very lovely ?
Steffen, starting with fresh hope into a new week
