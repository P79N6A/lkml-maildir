You can something along the lines os:
menu "Networking options and protocols"
config NET
	bool "Networking support"
	default y
if NET
...
menu "Network device support"
...
endmenu
...
endif
endmenu
Then everything wrapped in between if NET/endif is dependent on NET
without stating this explicitly.
You will alos have the menu nice indented.
