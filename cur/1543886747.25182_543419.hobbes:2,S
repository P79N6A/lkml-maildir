I tend to believe that. I've slowed down the FANs on my dual-athlon XP
to silent them, and I found the system to be (apparently) stable till
96 deg Celsius with FANs unplugged. So I regulated them in order to maintain
a temperature below 90 deg for a safety margin, and they seem to be as
happy as my ears. They've been like that for the last 3-4 years, I don't
remember.
On a related note, older technology is less sensible. My old VAX VLC4000
from 1991 which received a small heatsink in exchange for its noisy fans
is still doing well in an closed place. I'm more worried for the EPROMs
which store the boot code. Also, I think that the RS6000 processed at
half-micron which run the Mars rovers might run for hundreds of years
at 30 MHz.

even at 60, many of them die within a few years. Bu  I think we're
"slightly" off-topic now...
