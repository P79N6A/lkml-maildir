I don't know much about the real-time preemption work, but I can explain 
what the code was supposed to be doing.
Interrupts are disabled during usb_hcd_giveback_urb because that's how it
was done originally and nobody has made an effort to remove this
assumption from the USB device drivers.  There's no real reason for it
other than historical inertia.  It's not done for serialization -- there's
no need for serialization since an URB can't be resubmitted before the
previous callback occurs (unless a driver is badly broken).  The
"detached" method is used simply to avoid an extra pair of enable/disable
instructions.
Personally I think it would be an improvement if we changed things to
allow callbacks with interrupts enabled.  This would require a lot of 
auditing of USB drivers, but in the end it should prove worthwhile.

Same answer as above: The call is done with interrupts disabled because 
it was always done that way.

It would cause a deadlock.  Not to mention that this is not what urb->lock
is intended for (protection of urb->status).
