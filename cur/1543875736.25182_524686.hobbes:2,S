I puttered around with your testcase a bit, and didn't see interactive
tasks starving other interactive tasks so much as plain old interactive
tasks starving expired tasks, which they're supposed to be able to do,
but to a limited degree.  Merely forcing array switches fixes that here,
however array switches can be _very_ rough on interactivity, so I tried
a hybrid of the forced array switch and...

...the above, and it seems to work.  Below is a rough (second) cut,
which tries to preserve interactivity, but also ensure that
non-interactive tasks _will_ receive cpu in a reasonable amount of time.
It only engages when we're not expiring non-interactive tasks, ie should
have no effect until we're exclusively running interactive tasks, but
then it should also prevent the interactive/interactive starvation
scenario as well.  It doesn't attempt to enforce fairness, only prevent
terminal starvation.  With this patch^W(mess?;) I got the numbers below,
whereas without it, the distribution was pretty ugly.  I didn't try it
with many many attackers.  (many many false interactive tasks is doomed
unless you detect and switch behavior)
Interactivity still seems to be fine with reasonable non-interactive
loads despite ~reserving more bandwidth for non-interactive tasks.  Only
lightly tested, YMMV, and of course the standard guarantee applies ;)
