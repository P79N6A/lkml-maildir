I've got no problem with that, of course.  I guess I was thinking

So what I'm seeing is a failure at 100MHz operation.  Is there any way
to put the Promise into 66MHz mode (other than using a drive that runs
no faster)?  Because at this point I don't have any practical way to
rule out the possibility that the cable/drive are what's marginal at
100MHz; aside from the Promise, I don't have anything faster than a
UDMA66 card (which works fine with them).
I also managed to find a useful non-broken link on ASUS's web site and
found that they had snuck out a BIOS update later than the latest I had
previously known of, and it did include a minor change in the Promise
BIOS (from 2.01 build 19 to build 35).  Made no difference, though: the
50MB copy still failed as usual with 22-rc2.
