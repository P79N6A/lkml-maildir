well, some days ago started taking my 2.2.16 aironet4500_cs  up to date
with pcmcia-cs-3.1.19 and had to answer the same question
from myself. Answer: I dont know.
I found(recalled) that I have some personal problems with pcmcia...
Could anyone point me some reading material, which would tell:
1. why most of pcmcia drivers have the same(huge) amount of about
    same code at initialization/cleanup ?
2. What all of those structures/functions mean and under what circumstances
    may be  called and so on ?
    could I get pcmcia network card initalized with same amount of codelines
    as ISA and PCI ?
3. What is the best driver/path to take(if proper documentation is not available)
    as an example to redo all of this in my driver if it is plain wrong ?
4. I'd like to play with acpi/APM a bit, any ref implementations  for pcmcia ?
5. Is there a way to avoid cardmgr, i.e. for boxes which have 4 cards in and they probably   will
stay there forever   (currently one is on my table).  That those pcmcia cards would behave
normal network cards way without userspace helpers ?
elmer.
