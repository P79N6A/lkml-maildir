I believe you misread what I said.  Just before the above quote, I said "We are 
discussing the case where the socket is nonblocking and the udp checksum is 
corrupt, right? "
What I had in mind was that the non-blocking file descriptor have select() 
return without verifying the checksum, and if it was discovered to be bad at 
recvmsg() time, we return EAGAIN.  For a blocking file descriptor, we would 
verify the checksum before returning from select().
That way, the blocking case gets the semantics it expects (although worse 
performance), while the nonblocking case gets full performance as well as 
semantics that it will handle properly.
