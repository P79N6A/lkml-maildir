Hi guys,
I'm having troubles with ipc semaphores in a software I'm developing and 
that I plan to license under GPL as soon as it reach a beta version.
It's a mail server that will run on linux, hp-ux and nt that makes large use 
of "threads" and ipc semaphores and shared memory.
I've realized a common system independent API for sockets, threads, semaphores 
and shared memory.
For now to keep the same hp-ux interface I've implemented:
unsigned long SysCreateThread(int (*pThreadProc)(void *), void *pThreadData)
{
		pid_t pid = fork(); /* clone(...) */
		if (pid == 0)
				exit(pThreadProc(pThreadData));
		return (pid);
}
This is the steps the program makes ( in few words ).
The main thread ( A ) create a semaphore with a unique key ( tested ) that is a global variabile:
		mlr_key = SysCreateIPCKey();
		SYS_SEMAPHORE semid = semget(mlr_key, 1, IPC_CREATE | IPC_EXCL | 0600);
and the semid is OK.
Then it creates N ( four in my case, B1..B4 ) mailer threads ( with the function above ) 
that connect with the semaphore mlr_key and wait:
static int      SysSemLock(SYS_SEMAPHORE SemID, int iCount, int iSemNumber)
{
		struct sembuf   SemBuf;
		ZeroData(SemBuf);
		SemBuf.sem_num = iSemNumber;
		SemBuf.sem_op = -iCount;
		SemBuf.sem_flg = 0;
		return (semop((int) SemID, &SemBuf, 1));
}
int MailerThread(void * pThreadData)
{
		SYS_SEMAPHORE semid = semget(mlr_key, 1, 0);
		...
		for (;;)
		{
				SysSemLock(semid, 1, 0);
				printf("thread unlocked\n");
				...
				/* Process spool */
		}
		...
}
Then the main thread ( A ) create an SMTP server thread ( C ).
This thread handle SMTP conections and create a new thread for 
each connection ( D ).
This thread, after a mail is received push it in the spool directory 
and then :
		SYS_SEMAPHORE semid = semget(mlr_key, 1, 0);
		SysSemLock(semid, -1, 0);
to release a mailer thread ( B1..B4 ).
Now, arrive an SMTP connection, the file is pushed into the spool, 
semaphore is successfully get and unlocked but, on linux, mailer thread 
never wakeup.
It works fine under hp-ux and nt.
But, when main thread ( A ) stop it do a:
		SYS_SEMAPHORE semid = semget(mlr_key, 1, 0);
		SysSemLock(semid, -NumMailerThreads, 0);
and this release mailer threads.
0                    A Main
                    / \
                   /   \
                  /     \
                 /       \
1       Mailers B         C SMTP server
                           \
                            \
                             \
                              \
2                              D SMTP session
There are a lot of others semaphores used in my app, and these works fine.
It seems that ipc ops are accepted only along threads that belongs to the 
same path ( A-C A-D C-D ) but doesn't work if D try to wakeup B.
And there's no error returned by semop(), it seems like always gone right 
but mailer threads continue to sleep.
Any ideas ?
Cheers,
		Davide.
