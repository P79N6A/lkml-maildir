Actually, after some investigation (read: booting off a Slackware 7.1
bootable cd), I discovered that fileutils 3.13 (running under glibc 2.1.1,
no less - looks like the boot image hasn't been updated lately...) works -
ls reports the file size correctly.
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     3072000000 Aug 22 06:38 3gigfile
strace has confirmed that lstat() returns the correct value as well.  The
problem seems to be with how ls in fileutils 4.0 *prints* the file size -
somewhere, it's getting converted to an integer, which would be a Bad
Thing (TM).
If I knew more about C than I do now (read: next to nothing), I'd have
this problem fixed by now - but right now, I'm just tracing through a mess
of functions, trying to figure out where exactly things are going wrong.
I guess this is one for GNU, not for the kernel list.
Thanks.
