.59 ? Ugh, a load of stuff has changed in agpgart/ since then.
Can you recall when it last actually worked for you ?

You can test basic GART functionality with testgart

If thats what I think it is, its not a bug. This has come up a number
of times on the dri-devel list.
libGL does a test which runs 3dnow instructions. Obviouslly it'll
crash on a non-3dnow capable box, but prior to the test it installs
an exception handler to fix things up if it all goes awry.
Whats the debian bugzilla number for this bug out of interest ?

The latter is normal, the former isn't (obviously).
Does it reboot as soon as you modprobe them, or when X/DRI starts ?
