Every block driver has to have such a line. The current plug
mehanism is only good if it is checked for and honoured by the
low level driver, as the only thing which plug_device() does
is:
	dev->current_request = &dev->plug;
Some drivers might check it as follows (like the SCSI driver):
        if (CURRENT != NULL && CURRENT->rq_status == RQ_INACTIVE) { 
            return;   
        }
which is the same thing, as dev->plug is initialized as:
                dev->plug.rq_status  = RQ_INACTIVE;
                dev->plug.cmd        = -1;

All the above are not needed in my opinion.

I wrote this code as well, but when we originally designed the RAID-5
driver, in 2.0.x, before the get_queue() addition, and isn't related to
it at all. It is #if'd 0 just because we couldn't justify the additional
complexity with actual performance figures.
This code just tried to:
1. unplug only specific majors which include the disks in the
   RAID set rather then using run_task_queue() which will unplug
   all devices. Nothing unclean about that; the lower the granularity
   the better, in my opinion.
2. Try to overlap I/O while perfroming some other processing.
I agree with Eric's suggestion of having a per kdev_t "descriptor". This
can include various things, just as a private queue, a private plug if
we decide continuing using that, and even private dirty list for buffer.c,
private hash table for buffer lookup, statistics about the current
and maximum device speed (which could be used to tune the kflushd()
daemon), etc.
