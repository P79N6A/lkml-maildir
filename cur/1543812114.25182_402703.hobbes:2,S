That's pathetic.  You couldn't even CC linux-kernel on your answer.  And 
this is not even the first or second time you've been asked to CC a 
maintainer.
If you don't have time for a simple CC to the relevant maintainer, 
allowing for peer review, then find some other project to contribute to. 
  We don't need more closed development assholes.
This is open source, keyword OPEN.
