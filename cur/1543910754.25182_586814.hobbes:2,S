Nope...
TCP may make a difference if the problem is related to the network
being slow or lossy, but will not affect anything if the server
is just slow or down.  Even if TCP would have eventually gotten
all of the packets in a request or response through, the client
may time out, cease waiting, and corruption may occur again.
