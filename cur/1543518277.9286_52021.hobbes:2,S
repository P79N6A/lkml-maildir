Binary only drivers can be reengineder by disassembling them. And they
are
not a prerequsite for keeping the real intrinsics closed. One could as
well
write the driver in such a kind of C (possibly automatically generated
:-)
That it could as well be quite comparable to some kind of assembler.
(function names like f0001(x,y,z) and such...). This would still leave
the
possiblity to fix some basic minor kernel interface issues on demand.
