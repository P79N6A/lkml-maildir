Greetings,
	I can't get file locking to work for an app running on a solaris 2.5.1
client with a database on a linux 2.2.[4|5] server.  The app uses the fcntl()
call and gets  "ENOLOCKS" back ( according to truss ).
Has anyone got this combination working wrt to file locking?
Must I use the knfsd package perhaps?
Thanks,
