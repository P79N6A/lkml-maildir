On my Pentium 4:
- 6.30 cycles to copy %cr2 to %eax
- 1.05 cycles to compute a non-coloured current by masking %esp
- 2.31 cycles to compute a coloured current by your code above
I did some tests on using %cr2 for get_processor_id() a while ago,
but it was clearly slower (58% on P6, 20% on K6-III, 3% on P5MMX)
than *((%esp & mask)+offset), even though the latter also does a load.
