The slram patch at 
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~keryan/slram/
 will let you
use it as swap/ramdisk but will probably not be very useful because
demand-paged executables will be continually reread off of disk.
A VIA MVP3-based motherboard is one option; I believe that most of the
boards that have 1MB cache will cache 256MB (and no more) but YMMV so
check with the manufacturer first.
