Concur, pleae lets allow dont and cant.
Can we have a rule that periods terminating kernel messages 
are depreciated?

Just wastes space on the line, should this be depreciated?

Concur,
As to printing numbers, which form to use?
Should numbers in parenthesis be depreciated?
printk("Count is (%d)\n");
What about colons?
printk"Count is: %d\n");
Or just straight and simple:
printk("Count is %d\n");
Numbers in a sentence:
printk("Size %d is too big, adjusted to %d\n");
printk("Size %d is too big, adjusted to: %d\n");
Regards
Michael
