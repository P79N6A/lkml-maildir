The point is: the way we do development here is to break things down
into a series of simple, obvious pieces and send them individually.
Each patch should build and run when applied on top of the earlier
patches. Then each part can be reviewed, tested, and applied on its
own. It also makes figuring out what happened in the future and
tracking down bugs much easier.
So send three patches in this order:
- fix get_random_int
- rename it
- add auxv bits
Also, you might want to drop Linus from the cc: list unless he's
chimed in on this topic already. The likely path here is for the first
two patches to go through me and the last to go through Arjan, then on
to Andrew Morton for his -mm tree, and then to Linus after a bit.
