Every one of our internal and production servers requires a minimum of
3000 fds. (Well, okay, about three out of a hundred boxes don't actually
need that many). We've done some prelim tests on a server with
2.2.7-ac2, but I admit my boss was crestfallen to find out that the fd
mods didn't make the mainstream kernel.
