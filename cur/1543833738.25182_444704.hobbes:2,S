So the Plan 9 and Unix way would be to let the driver parse the number
part of the name after the last slash.  What I don't understand is why
reiserfs is getting involved here, rather than recognizing the driver as
an extension of the namespace, seeing the driver as a mountpoint, and
just passing number to the driver.  There must be something I don't
grasp here, can you help me?
