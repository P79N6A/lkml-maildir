OProfile has a simplistic view of the performance monitoring hardware. The 
routines in libop/op_alloc_counter.c determine what set of performance registers 
is available from the processor in use. There is no check to see what registers 
are actually available in the /dev/oprofile directory.
opcontrol executes ophelp to determine which specific counters to count which 
events. The function map_event_to_counter() in libop/op_alloc_counter.c does the 
actual selection. It seems what is needed is for map_event_to_counter() to check 
to see which counters are available and mark the others as unavailable.
