Subject: bug in 2.4.2-ac20 net/irda/af_irda.c or init/main.c

As per my previous e-mail (on l-k), built-in irda causes an infinite loop
during bootup (ie, a lockup) by double-registering the same notifier.
This happens because irda_proto_init is both called by init/main.c and set as
a module_init() function which is then mapped to __initcall when built
non-modular.  So the notifier chain becomes looped as per the previous e-mail.
The fix is to remove one of these, for my system I'm moving the module_init
inside the #ifdef MODULE, someone else can choose what's best for the kernel
at large...
David.
