i made this mistake as well - until Linus pointed out the fact that
pagecache get_page()/put_page() are naturally synchronized by the
pagecache spinlock and the combination of page->inode. Buffer-cache pages
are synchronized by the kernel lock and the existence of page->buffers. 
[or whatever native buffer-cache lock there is]
normal 'free floating' pages might indeed go away unexpectedly, but
shrink_mmap() should not deal with such pages .. unless you do something
unusual.
