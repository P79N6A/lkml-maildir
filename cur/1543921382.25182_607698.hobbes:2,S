I suspend those long delays may have something to do with USB,
as it takes longer for my hub + mouse to come back to life
during the sequence.
But I have since then re-applied the powertop patches,
and the long delays vanished.  Back with -rc9 I normally also
had those powertop fixes, and so this problem could be much
older and was never noticed until I ran without them.
I'm no longer actively investigating, as the delays are
gone (powertop patches), and the crashes are much less frequent
since patching.
Cheers
