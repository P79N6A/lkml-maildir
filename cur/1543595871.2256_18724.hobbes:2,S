I had a similiar problem once, and wrote a module that overwrote the
loopback net device. Since it's loopback, the kernel won't care about
headers.
Yeah, I know: Quick & Dirty.
I made the new loopback put its packets in a queue and then deliver them
after a (adjustable) delay.
If I can still find the source for this, I'll post it here.
