:) Tongue was firmly in cheek. I guess I should have said more initially. It 
wasn't so much the patch, as the speed with which they're coming. It makes me 
(at least) feel like the stable series is unstable. Couldn't you store them 
up for a day or two at a time (unless of course they really are that 
important that they require a quicker cycle).
