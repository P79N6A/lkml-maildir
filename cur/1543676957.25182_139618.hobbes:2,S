Greg:
There is a bug in drivers/base/class.c in 2.5.70.  Near the start of the
routine class_device_add() are the lines
        if (class_dev->dev)
                get_device(class_dev->dev);
But there's nothing to undo this get_device, either in the error return 
part of class_device_add() or in class_device_del().
I assume that either this get_device() doesn't belong there or else there
should be corresponding put_device() calls in the other two spots.  
Whichever is the case, it should be easy for you to fix.
