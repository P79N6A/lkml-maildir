The 'no tones' confused me too.  In 'make menuconfig', go to 'Input Device support',
select 'Misc' - this will add an entry 'PC Speaker Support'.  Check that, it will add
CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR which should make the beeps return.
If you hit other snags, *read the post-halloween file*.  Most of the gotchas are
in there already.  If you do what that says, and it STILL doesn't work, feel free to
post again - the whole point of the -testX series is so we can find all the remaining
gotchas and either fix or workaround them.
