It's great that it's there, but still doesn't tell you everything.

I don't think that files are that easy, at least from what I know now from
hfs. For example reading from a file might require a read from a btree
file (extent file), with what another file write can be busy with (e.g.
reordering the btree nodes).
I really would prefer that a fs could sleep _and_ can use semaphores,
that would keep locking simple, otherwise it gets only a fscking mess.
bye, Roman
