Hi Pat,
I'm a bit surprised to find yet another top-level directory in sysfs --
"fs". Wouldn't it be a bit more driver-model-conforming if there'd be a
"bus_type block_bus_type" with devices like "hda", "fd0", "loop0", and each
such block device registers a device like "hda1" for partitions of "bus_type
filesystem_bus_type" (or "partition_bus_type"). And the device drivers for 
these devices are then the filesystems. 
A few example on how this could look like in sysfs:
sys/devices/pci0/00:07.1/ide0/hda/hda1
sys/devices/platform/fd0/fd0
? sys/devices/virtual/loop0  (a new "virtual" bus would allow us to register
				"virtual" and "dummy" devices)
sys/bus/filesystem/devices/hda1
sys/bus/filesystem/devices/fd0
sys/bus/filesystem/drivers/xfs
sys/bus/block/devices/hda
Oh, and is the kobj in super_block (which was added in the same sys/fs
patch) used anywhere?
