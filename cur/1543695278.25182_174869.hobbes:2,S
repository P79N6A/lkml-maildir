Linus, why don't you refuse updates from these projects until this is sorted
out? Your proposal is exactly what it needed. For a year now I have been poking
at these issues and making very little progress. I do know that all of the
pieces needed already exist; but without some incentive there is very little
reason to rearchitect the existing code. 
Personally I'm working on a standalone version of Mesa (OpenGL). This would
allow us to write a 3D hardware based windowing system in response to the ones
on the Mac and MS Longhorn. But instead of working on a windowing system I've
spent all of my time trying to help sort out the video device drivers.
