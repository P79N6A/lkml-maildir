Alan - 
The last patch Christoph posted against 2.5 is not the least bit 
invasive.  Excluding documentation and configuration files, these are
the changes:
o 1 new process flag:   +#define PF_FSTRANS 0x00100000
o 1 new CTL_VM name:    +       VM_PAGEBUF=18
o 1 new CTL_FS name:    +       FS_XFS=17
o 1 exported symbol:    +EXPORT_SYMBOL(mark_page_accessed);
and of course an addition to fs/Makefile:
+obj-$(CONFIG_XFS_FS)           += xfs/
That's it.  The rest is under fs/xfs.
(2.4 is more invasive, but this thread started out talking about XFS in
2.5).
