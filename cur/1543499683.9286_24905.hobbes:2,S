No idea. It only happened once, and things recovered,  so I didn't look
into it.
There are two very interesting datapoints you could give us
1) If after a few weeks, the de4x5 driver hasn't dropped the network, we
can be reasonably sure of a serious problem in the tulip.c driver
(possibly a generic flaw because I've had hassles with 3c59x.c too)
2) It would be interesting to know if the "Insufficient memory" thing
shows up again, and if so, how often
Cheers
