Subject: [PATCH] make SPEAKUP_DEFAULT depend on SPEAKUP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When running `make oldconfig' with my 2.6.13-rc3 config on 2.6.13-rc3-mm1 I
got a bit surprised when I answered `N'o to CONFIG_SPEAKUP but then still 
got prompted for CONFIG_SPEAKUP_DEFAULT - that didn't make sense, why would 
I want to select a default synthesizer for speakup if I have disabled speakup 
alltogether in the first place?
The patch below makes SPEAKUP_DEFAULT depend on SPEAKUP. I believe that's the 
sane thing to do :)
