Is there any reason we couldn't set the maximum smaller than that?  It
looks like the acl entries are pretty compact (12 bytes if I'm reading
the xdr code right?) so if we limited the length of an xdr-encoded acl
to a page that would still allow a few hundred entries.  Are there
really people that need 1000-entry acls?
