Subject: Makefile targets: tar & rpm pkgs, while using O=<dir> as non-root

Unpacked 2.6.13.3 and made it read-only.
Using the "O=" param, built output tree for another machine as
a non-root user.
I wanted to create an installable kernel & module package to copy
to the new machine & install.
I noted new targets:
    binrpm-pkg [& rpm-pkg], and
    tarbz2-pkg [& targz-pkg, & tar-pkg].
Both seem to fail either for reasons that appear to be related to
not honoring the "O=" param, or attempting to actually install into
the root of my build-machine.
Should these targets work or have they not yet been converted to work
within the "O=" framework?  In cases where the Makefile is attempting
to install into "<Root>/boot" or "<Root>/lib/modules" ,should I
expect the output to appear in "$O/boot" and "$O/lib/modules/"?
Please Cc responses to me, in addition to list, thanks.
