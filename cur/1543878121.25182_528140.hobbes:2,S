I usually indent this way if expressions exceed the 80 columns limit:
	if (foo___________ &&
	    bar___________) {
		doit;
	}
and
	if ((one___________ ||
	     one_and_a_half) &&
	    two___________) {
		doit;
	}
and
	call(abc_______,
	     def___);
and
static int definition(abc_______,
		      def___)
{
...
and I know I'm not the only one.  Yes, this means I indent with tabs and
spaces --- if I wrap within expressions or within lists of function
arguments.  Of course there are always leading tabs before spaces, never
leading spaces.
PS:  Everyone please try to avoid blowing CodingStyle up to a 200 pages
document.  Thanks.
