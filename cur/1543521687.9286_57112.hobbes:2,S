Rest assured that it won't. While the patch from v2.0.38 to v2.0.39 *will*
be somewhat larger than v2.0.37 to v2.0.38, the changes will be almost as
minimal. No new features.
v2.0.39pre1 is 5160 bytes. v2.0.39pre2 is, at the moment (not yet
finalised) 167075 bytes, and will probably not grow much further. 2979
bytes of the diff touches code (and that includes the diff context), the
rest is white-space changes, changes of Documentation, CREDITS,
MAINTAINERS, whitespace, backporting of a code-page 8859-14 and some
other text-fixes.
The only thing I consider adding now is a change to the Makefile to add
an extra-version during the pre-patches.
