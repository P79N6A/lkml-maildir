I use both MS-Windows and Linux, and recently I tried out the version 4 of the Norton Utilities (for Windows) and I am very impressed ---- especially the system-doctor, disk-doctor and the seamless integration of various utilites.
If ever there is a Norton Utilities (or similar) for Linux, I bet Linux would be used by more people, since the system-doctor feature alone may help many users to fine-tune their Linux systems.
So, will there ever be a Norton Utlities (or similar) for Linux?
If Symantec won't do it, will someone do a Norton Utlities clone (GPLed?) for Linux?
