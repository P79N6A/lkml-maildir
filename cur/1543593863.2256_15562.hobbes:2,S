I think fixing the orphaned swap pages problem will eliminate the
problem all together.  Probably there is no need to optimize
swapoff.
Because as the system is shutting down all the processes will be
killed and their pages in swap will be orphaned. If those pages
were to be reaped in a timely manner there wouldn't be any work
left for swapoff.
