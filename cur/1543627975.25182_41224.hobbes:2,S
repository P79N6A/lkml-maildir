It used to be, somebody realised that it did not work and took it out
of __init.  With sorted tables it can be moved back.
/*

 */
static int do_test_wp_bit(unsigned long vaddr);
That fixes the symptom, not the cause.  It is better to sort the tables
at boot time than to find each bit of code that might break the tables
and change the code.
