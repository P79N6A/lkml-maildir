"The mouse is used to point at the xterm you want to type in."
So, sorry, no, I did not. However, Stefan notes his experience
with some earlier patches with [xg]config:

For you, I installed qt3-devel/libglade2-devel on my machine
and ran it in [xg]config.

That seems very much like a bug^Wmissing feature in [xg]config's
"Split View". It does work in Single View and Tree View.

It works a bit different than 'menu'. An object will be put into a
menuconfig-menu IFF it has a depends on the menuconfig item.
This is different from menu-menus, which have "sort of" an
implicit "if/endif" block.
