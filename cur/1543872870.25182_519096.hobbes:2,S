I had a look at the second leak reported it seems to be caused by the
same proc_set_tty() call but, in this case, there is no
disassociate_tty() call for the task (and the patch I posted is not
enough). Maybe something like below (no thourough testing):
diff --git a/drivers/char/tty_io.c b/drivers/char/tty_io.c
index db91398..ea6ca7d 100644
