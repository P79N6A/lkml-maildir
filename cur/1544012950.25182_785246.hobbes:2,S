You forgot to state why the admin should control that?
Each sysctl essentially presents a failure of the automatic tuning
algorithms of the kernel (kernel hackers admitting defeat). 
So a patch adding new ones at least needs a clear rationale what
problem it is trying to fix and why the automatic tuning cannot be
fixed instead to address this case without new knobs.
