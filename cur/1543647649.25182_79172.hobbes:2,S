I support a SAP system (so far on solaris) at work.  I make extensive use
of a volume manager there.  On linux I have tried both LVM1 and EVMS.  I
stopped using LVM1 the thrid time it caused me to restore after a clean 
boot...  This problem may well have been fixed in LVM2 - I have not used it.
On the other had EVMS has never scrambled my disks.  It also offers more
options, including an encapsulated LVM1.  From my perspective EVMS wins.
