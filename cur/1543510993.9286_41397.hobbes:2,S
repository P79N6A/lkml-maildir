This sounds barely possible even on a loaded 100baseTX net
(100Mb/s ~ 10kint/s) but high.  Unless you've set HZ 'way high.
Is this some real-time application?

It is a bit tricky so I'm happy to explain:  the while < 90 is
to throw away any non-interrupted loops.  a pair of rdtsc's
usually take only 32 cycles, but I'm allowing something for
loop overhead.  Feel free to change this to 0 and look at the
printout!
The 500 count is indeed arbitrary.  I just wanted to count 500
interrupts.  The (t-c+32)&-64 is a rounding to the nearest 64
of the cycle count for the interrupt service.   Makes the uniq -c
work better as a histogram.

On x86 at least, all preemption _must_ happen by an interrupt or
syscall.  There are at least HZ (=100) interrupts per second.
I have no syscalls in my inner loop.

I thought of this and avoided it.  Of course there's tons of
overhead with printf.  So note that I reload my base cycle
counter (c).
