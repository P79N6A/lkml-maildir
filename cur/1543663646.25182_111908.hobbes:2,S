2.5.62 kernel, w/o module support.
ALSA device list:
 #0: Intel 82801BA-ICH2 at 0xe800, irq 10
Firstly, I noticed that the soundsystem freezes in time-to-time for about
half second or so. And it is terribly annoying when playing mp3 or video.
But even worse, sometimes the program that uses audio suddenly freezes
with a kernel bug (given below) and after that, everything that wants to
use audio will hang completely aswell. For example, using 'strace' on
alsamixer now gives:
open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY)    = 3
close(3
...and of course it hangs completely there.
After that, killing the process does not help either.
Rebooting the machine helps... for about few hours after the bug
appears again. Here is the bug that will come time-to-time when
using audio in the first place:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
