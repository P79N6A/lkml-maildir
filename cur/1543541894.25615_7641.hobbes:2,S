That all depends on how you define "file" - is it "an MFT record" or "a
block of data with a name"? If the latter, streams ARE files.

Why can't each stream have its own [acm]time and permissions?

They are largely independent. There are three things (under NTFS) which
link streams to each other: the first part of the filename, the shared
[acm]time, and the shared ACL. The latter two are just limitations of
NTFS, which we do not need to duplicate. The former is largely cosmetic,
and is already supported by every "Unixy" filesystem anyway - so what
needs doing?

Such as? I honestly haven't seen any distinctions which should be
perpetuated.
