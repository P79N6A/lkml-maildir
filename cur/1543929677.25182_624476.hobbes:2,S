I've done the following:
-untared a clean 2.6.24-rc4 and compiled it with my 2.6.23.1-settings in order
 to verify that the driver is still broken: checked, the box still won't 
 boot.
-patched the just compiled kernel source with your patch, "make dist-clean"
 (by means of "make-kpkg clean") and recompile: box boots fine.
I've put the captured console logs to
http://w.sysiphus.de/dpt_i2o/bootlog.2624-rc4-pristine
http://w.sysiphus.de/dpt_i2o/bootlog.2624-rc4-patched
... and the kernelconfig (which shouldn't matter) to
http://w.sysiphus.de/dpt_i2o/kernelconfig.2624-rc4
Regards,
Anders
