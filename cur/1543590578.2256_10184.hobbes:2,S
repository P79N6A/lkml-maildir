I noticed that my favorite "errno" has now gotten trashed by
the newer 'C' runtime libraries.
ENOTTY has been for ages, "Not a typewriter".
It's now been changed to "Inappropriate ioctl for device".
Methinks that this means that ../linux/include/asm/errno.h now needs
to be updated:
-#define	ENOTTY		25	/* Not a typewriter */
+#define	ENOTTY		25	/* Inappropriate ioctl for device 
*/
None of these strings are in the kernel, but the headers probably should
show the "latest standard".
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
