Err, Dave, that's *exactly* the point of the ccCluster stuff.  You get
all that seperation for every data structure for free.  Think about
it a bit.  Aren't you going to feel a little bit stupid if you do all
this work, one object at a time, and someone can come along and do the
whole OS in one swoop?  Yeah, I'm spouting crap, it isn't that easy,
but it is much easier than the route you are taking.
