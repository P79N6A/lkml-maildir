It makes it much more messy and awkward as the same system behaves in
arbitary different ways under different builds of the kernel.
If you want to sort this in Fedora for example you just need to package
and announce a desktop-tuning rpm which makes the relevant updates on
install and reverses them on remove. Stick the scheduler/vm tuning values
in as well and the disk queue tweaks.
Regardless of the kernel defaults people will install such a package
en-mass...
