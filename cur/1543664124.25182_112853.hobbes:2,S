/dev/shm ? Supposed to be there on many systems anyway. Fix
'mount' and 'umount' so that if they see /etc/mtab is a symlink,
they follow it and create the temp files etc in the destination
directory of the link instead of in /etc. Then
ln -sf /dev/shm/mtab /etc/mtab et voila
I've been thinking of doing this for Debian.
Mike.
