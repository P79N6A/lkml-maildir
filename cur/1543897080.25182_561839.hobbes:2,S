My point is commit c45b4f1f1e149c023762ac4be166ead1818cefef
CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is currently known as an experimental feature to 
improve the _performance_.

For a given gcc version, there's a finite number of differences between 
-Os and -O2. 
The interesting question is for which differences with gcc 4.2 we want 
the -Os version in the kernel for best performance. This should then be 
controllable through gcc options.

That's a different point.
If you don't care about performance but care about size then -Os is 
the best choice.

Agreed, but CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE should again be under 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
