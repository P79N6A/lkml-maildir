Seems to me that maybe (part of) the solution would be maintaining a big  
Linux CVS (or Bitkeeper or ...) archive somewhere.
Not necessarily maintained by Linus - he doesn't need that extra load.
The idea would be to have that archive as free of policy as possible.  
Anything that could be kept in there, would, under appropriate branches  
and labels.
That way, stuff that had not yet been integrated into the mainline kernel  
would still be available from a central place, could be checked easily  
against (proposed or actual) changes, and so on.
It's not a complete solution, of course. But it certainly should improve  
the ability to keep track of stuff.
