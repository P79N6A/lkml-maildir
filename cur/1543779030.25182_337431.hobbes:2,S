Subject: [Patch] Trival - Add warning to init/main.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I passed init=/mylinuxrc to the kernel on the command line.  The kernel
silently dropped down to exec /sbin/init.  It turned out that /mylinuxrc
had improper permissions.  Without any warning message from the kernel
that something was wrong it took awhile to find the issue.  The patch
below adds a warning.
Regards,
Brian Avery
