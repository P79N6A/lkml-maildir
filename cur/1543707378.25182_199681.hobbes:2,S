Hello,
the new radeon fb driver fails to clear the last console line after scrolling 
up the screen.
That means that my prompt, for example,
looks like the one pictured below
[ silla@mermaid ~ ]
$ _illa@mermaid ~ ]
instead of
[ silla@mermaid ~ ]
$ _
This only happens after exiting from Xfree (I'm currently running version 
4.3.0.1) and a quick fbset is enough to get the situation back to normal.
The old driver works fine, except for the garbled screen at boot up, but 
everybody already knows that.
Let me know if you need further information.
Regards,
Silla Rizzoli
