and I gave you (off list) details of why this fails wrt UK law.
16(1)(a) reserves copying,  16(1)(b) reserves redistribution,
and 16(1)(e) reserves adaption,  together with copying and
redistributing adaptions.
So taken together they have removed all of the above,  and require that
one has a licence to do so.
Then 50C gives back some limited rights wrt computer programs.  Namely
that one can make such copies and adaptations as one needs in order to
use the program.  However,  importantly it does _not_ give back any
redistribution rights,  so they still require a licence.
This should meet your requirement for a jurisdiction who's law limits
what your are suggesting.
Hence to redistribute a program with patches applied needs a licence.
