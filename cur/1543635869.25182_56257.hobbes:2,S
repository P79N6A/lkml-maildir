Hi!
We've been having some problems with the route cache corrupting on us,
suddenly every connection we made went out to the loopback interface,
and right back in the machine.
I've seen a patch in the 2.4.19 changelog headline:
"        Terrible bug in ipv4/route.c, mis-sized ip_rt_acct leads to"
Could this be the cause of this phenomena, or am I barking up the
wrong tree?
I'm currently running a modified 2.4.18-4. I'm aware that straying
from the vanilla is a recipe for trouble - but I'm wondering if this
specific problem could be caused by this bug. I haven't found anything
in the archives telling me what exactly this bug does. All I've seen
are references to it.
Thanks for any help you can give me!
Nir.
