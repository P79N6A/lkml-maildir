Possibly. Note that I wasn't intending to rewrite the dcache hash
specifically, but just demonstrate my lockless dynamic data structure
switch, and the dentry hash was the most obvious candidate.
But considering that it is lockless, and basically free in the fastpath
(ie. a single easily-predicted branch), then I'm better served by an
dynamically sized dynamic hash table than an inappropriately sized one.
Well, almost. The vmalloc issue is the downside, of course. But if I'm
on a NUMA that is doing vmalloc hashes anyway, then there is little
downside.
Out of curiosity, what better data structure do you have in mind for
the dentry hash?
