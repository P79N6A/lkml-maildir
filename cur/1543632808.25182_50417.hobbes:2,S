Yeah this annoys me too...

To some extent, I agree with you. However, I'm not sure it's worth it
abstracting this bit out. The size of the request queue right now in
2.5.20 (with plug change) is 196 bytes on i386 SMP. If you really feel
it's worth saving these bytes, then I'd much rather go in a different
direction: only keep the "main" elements of request_queue_t, and have
blk_init_queue() alloc the "remainder"

I left it that way on purpose, and yes I did see you changed that in the
previous patch as well. I think it's a bit of a mess to have both
blk_plug_device and blk_plug_queue. Without looking at it, I have no
idea which does what?! blk_queue_empty() will always be true for
make_request_fn type drivers, so no change is necessary there.
