Hi,
   i want to write an SDIO driver. There is not much information of
what an SDIO driver is
   supposed to do or any sample sdio drivers.
   I have a few questions regarding that:
   1) What is an SDIO Driver?.
   2) Is SDIO a protocol/standard to which all devices confirm?.
   3)  Is it a generic driver ?. (Same for a set of devices) or
different for each device?
        Suppose i want to run an SDIO WLAN Card?. will the
manufacturer support it or
       an will a Generic Driver "drive" it?
   4) What is a SD Driver?
   5) What are the differences between SD Driver and SDIO Driver?.
   6) Are there any sample/Open Source SDIO drivers available in Linux
Kernel or else where?.If, not when can one expect/is anyone working on
it currently?.

Thanks and Regards,
sriram
