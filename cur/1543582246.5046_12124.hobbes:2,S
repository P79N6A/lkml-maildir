Last time this question was raised, someone mentioned
a little utility called flushb . Here is its source:
/*
 * flushb.c --- This routine flushes the disk buffers for a disk
 */
/*
 * modified August 2000 by Juri Haberland
 * juri.haberland@innominate.de
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#define NOARGS void
const char *progname;
static void usage(NOARGS)
{
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s disk\n", progname);
        exit(1);
}      
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int     fd;
        progname = argv[0];
        if (argc != 2)
                usage();
        fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY, 0);
        if (fd < 0) {
                perror("open");
                exit(1);
        }
        /*
         * Note: to reread the partition table, use the ioctl
         * BLKRRPART instead of BLKFSLBUF.
         */
        if (ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF, 0) < 0) {
                perror("ioctl BLKFLSBUF");
                exit(1);
        }
        return 0;
}
