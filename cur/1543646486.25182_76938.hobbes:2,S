I've built 2.5.40 on a rh8.0 athlon box.  It boots up OK, but NO keyboard.
It's  a vanilla MS natural keyboard with a small DIN PS/2 connector - not 
USB. Works fine with 2.4.19 - even prior 2.5.x's.
I noticed that xconfig  Input device support grays out 
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD. As a test, I hand edited .config. Still didn't work.
.config is attached. Any help appreciated
