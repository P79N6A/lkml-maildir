Hello,
I'm trying to compile Intel's source for their eepro100 driver (Their driver is
somewhat faster than Becker's driver on my hardware, mostly it's a legacy thing)
on a 2.2.17 kernel (RedHat distributed, may have additional patches).
Unfortunately, it fails to compile with the following message:
gcc  -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -DLINUX -DEXPORT_SYMTAB  -I/usr/include -I. -D__SMP__
-DMODVERSIONS -O2 -pipe  -c e100.c -o e100_main.o
/usr/include/asm/smp.h: In function `hard_smp_processor_id':

                 from e100.h:44,
                 from e100.c:156:

make: *** [e100_main.o] Error 1

I know this module isn't supported, but if someone could point me in the
direction I need to go to get this to work. It appears as if these symbols exist
in i82489.h (which requires fixmap.h), but simply including them doesn't help
much. Is this a problem with the kernel or with the external module? (Doubting
the latter as the problem appears in smp.h...)
I appreciate any input you could provide,
