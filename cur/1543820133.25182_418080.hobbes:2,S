Both are the important issues.
You move the bulk of the packet processing work to the end
cores of the system, yes.  But you do so with an enormously
SMP friendly queue data structure so that it does not matter
at all that the packet is received on one cpu, yet processed
in socket context on another.
If you elide either part of the implementation, you miss the
entire point of net channels.
