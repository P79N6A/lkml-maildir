Subject: [KORG] Kernel sources online
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I suggest a link labeled "Browsable source code" to be added into the
www.kernel.org webpage like
BRLCAD has it 
http://www.brlcad.org/doxygen/index.html
 (Using Doxygen)
or Ronja has it 
http://ronja-svn.wservices.ch/file/browser/trunk/
 (Using
Trac).
Further I suggest a link labeled "README" added to www.kernel.org which
would point to the README in this browsable source tree. This way the
users could use the documentation as reference online easily.
