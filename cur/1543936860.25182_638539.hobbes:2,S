Generally it is a good idea to report problems with vendor built kernels
to the vendor and their support, especially one that is 3 releases behind.
They have a much better idea what is in that kernel and who else has seen
problems.

We issued commands, it didn't respond. That could be a libata problem but
actually looks more like an IRQ routing problem.

The PQI DOM is a bit odd, it is however known to work with libata at
least for the PATA one, and the versions which don't understand
SET_XFER_MODE to work with current kernels. (Your failure mode isn't the
SET_XFER_MODE one - it hasn't got that far).
