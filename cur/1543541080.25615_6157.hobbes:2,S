well spotted, yes, its wrong, thanks for pointing it out.

better, yes, and the comments were not mine, blargh, but I try not to touch
that much, just trying to fix the problems, this is up to the maintainer to
use whatever kind of comments, or el penguino can ask him to change to /**/.
the idea was to just do the menset if the link->dev allocation was successful,
like I did in other drivers in this patch, but yes, coding at 3pm and without
a good amount of caffeine is not safe ;)
