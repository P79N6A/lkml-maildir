Thats great. I was was thinking of the default settings. (its even
possible to lock down a windows machine to be "secure")
Also the daemons started from bootscripts that is not aware of PAM is
not affected by those settings. So an exploited security flaw in a
service would allow an attacker to bring the system down even if the
service is running as non-root.
Try running this from a boot script and you'll see that even if this
process is setuid, it will be able to fork more than 100 processes per
user:
/* this program should be started as root but it changes uid */
#define TTL 300
#define MAX 65536
#define UID 65534
int pids[MAX];
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int count = 0; pid_t pid;
        if (setuid(UID) < 0) {
                perror("setuid");
                exit(1);
        }
        while ((pid = fork()) >= 0 && count < MAX) {
                if (pid == 0) sleep(TTL);
                pids[count++] = pid;
        }
        printf("Forked %i new processes\n", count);
        while (count--) kill(pids[count], SIGTERM);
        return 0;
}

My point is, the default max allowed processes per user is too high. It
better to open up a restrictive default than locking down an generous
default.
