Maybe, though the option is on by default on the client (that is, if the 
server supports security_labels then the client will use it, unless 
instructed not to.)
To explain the choice in a longer name, I've got an RPC auth flavor for 
demonstrating client process label transport called 'auth_seclabel' that 
  is turned on in /etc/exports via sec=seclabel.
I'll make this change if you feel strongly about it though.  :)
