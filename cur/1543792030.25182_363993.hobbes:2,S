Yeah, not 100% sure about this one, which is why it has been sitting
around for so long.
It gives about 25% on contrived fork workload on an ia64 system, which
is probably about its best case workload+architecture. I haven't found
any notable regressions but it definitely isn't going to be any faster
when the page tables are in cache.
So long as I haven't found a real-world workload that is improved with
the patch, I won't be trynig to get it merged.
