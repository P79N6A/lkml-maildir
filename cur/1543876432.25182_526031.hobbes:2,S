I'm thinking we'll need to introduce something like freezing notifiers, ie.
the ability to register a notifier by an interested subsystem that will be
called right after user space processes have been frozen and right before
we start to thaw them (that may allow us to handle the microcode issue in
a clean way, for example).
Now if a filesystem registers a freezing notifier, it may be unmounted during
the suspend and remounted during the resume in more or less transparent
way.  I think an additional mount flag would be needed for filesystem that
should install such notifiers, like "removable".
Greetings,
Rafael
