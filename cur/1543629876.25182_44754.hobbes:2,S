Hi,
ftime() will return milliseconds, but it's considered an obsolete function.
You could use gettimeofday() (as Richard Johnson suggested) to get
microseconds and divide them to get milliseconds, although I don't know how
time critical your routines are.
If you're still looking for nanoseconds, I'm told you can use
clock_gettime() but it's still quite unavailable (I've never seen it myself,
yet).. however even if it was available you possibly wouldn't get a very
high resolution from it with current systems..
