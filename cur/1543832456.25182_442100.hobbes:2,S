The oldest gcc I can access quickly is 3.2.3 (May 2005) which has
significantly different wording.
  The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will assume that
  the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
  not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
  operands.  Use the constraint character `+' to indicate such an
  operand and list it with the output operands.
  When the constraints for the read-write operand (or the operand in
  which only some of the bits are to be changed) allows a register, you
  may, as an alternative, logically split its function into two
  separate operands, one input operand and one write-only output
  operand.  The connection between them is expressed by constraints
  which say they need to be in the same location when the instruction
  executes.
In 3.2.3, the '+' form allows any constraint, only the split notation
requires that the operand be in a register.  In 4.1.0, the docs now say
that the '+' form requires a register.  I suspect that you are right
and the gcc docs are incorrect, but it does not hurt to check.  Would
anybody from the gcc team like to pipe up and give an opinion?
