Yes on these.

I think execfve is fine.

We have fexecve already.  Adding -at variants is probably not the best
idea, it's confusing.  Note, that fexecve only takes a file
descriptor, not a file descriptor plus file name.
The only reason I could see for changing this is thatfexecve depends
on /proc.  But there is so much other functionality which won't work
if /proc isn't mounted that I'd rank this low.  I'm fine with just
adding execfve.
