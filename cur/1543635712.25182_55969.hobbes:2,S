Well, I don't know what to say about this...  The unmount path calls
ext2_put_super(), which marks the superblock clean and calls
ext2_sync_super() to force it to disk (this can be seen from debugfs
output).
On reboot the filesystem is not clean.  Either the kernel is not
doing what it should to flush the dirty superblock to disk, or the disk
is lying about having written the superblock to disk.  I would suspect
the latter on IDE drives, but SCSI drives are usually sane.
Try adding a sync or two before rebooting, and also checking via
debugfs after reboot to ensure it is marked dirty when it shouldn't
be.  You could even add some printk's to ext2_put_super() inside the
conditional where it marks the filesystem clean and syncs the super
to ensure that is being called.

What about the above message?
The fact that /dev/sda1 is your root fs could cause some strangeness also.
It would appear to be that ext2_remount() is missing "sb->s_flags |=
MS_RDONLY" after the comment "set the rdonly flag and then mark the
partition as valid again".  The other check for valid flags also appears
to be a bit suspect.
Cheers, Andreas
