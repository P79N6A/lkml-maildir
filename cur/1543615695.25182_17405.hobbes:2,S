Well, tried it out here on 2.4.17 (w/ ide.2.4.16 & freeswan_1.91) (and after
patching md.c and loop.c), and boy did it blow chunks! ;-)
First, loading the software watchdog module caused the thing to lock up
solid during boot. No SysRq response, and nmi_watchdog did nada too.
Next, after disabling the s/w watchdog, I could boot up.. great, I though it
was all happy. I tried starting up 1 instance of setiathome, and saw how
nicely it (mostly) remained affine to 1 processor, occasionally switching to
the 2nd, and back again, maybe every 5-10 seconds.
Next, though, I couldn't figure out why Mozilla wouldn't load. Then I
noticed I could not open any more xterms. When I went to one open xterm to
do some digging, I noticed very long pauses, where no keyboard input would
be accepted, yet the mouse and the window manager remained responsive. Other
tasks, like my scrolling network usage graph applet would stall as well.
Eventually (after another minute or so), the box locked up solid.
Well, I really liked the sound of this patch. Seemed very well though out.
Too bad it doesn't like me! :-(
You seem to indicate you've done (some) testing on 2.4.17, so I'm somewhat
surprised that it died on me so quickly here. What more info can I give you
that might help track the problem?
