Subject: [patch 0/5] lightweight robust futexes: -V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is release -V2 of the "lightweight robust futexes" patchset.
The patchset can also be downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lightweight-robust-futexes/
one detail i forgot to mention before is the .text effect of the 
feature:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 4698410  983432  798248 6480090  62e0da vmlinux.orig
 4700692  983504  798248 6482444  62ea0c vmlinux.vma-based    +2282 bytes
 4698941  983540  798248 6480729  62e359 vmlinux.list-based   +531 bytes
so we can get a more complete solution for a fourth of the .text size.
Changes since -V1:
 - fixed FUTEX=n build errors (found by Andrew Morton)
 - fixed patch ordering and other dependencies, so that at every step, 
   the kernel builds and boots fine with FUTEX=y and FUTEX=n.
