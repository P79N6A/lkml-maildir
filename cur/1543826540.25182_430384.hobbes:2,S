I am just thinking same thing, but one point is different.
To select policy by Kconfig is not flexible. If we want to change policy,
we have to rebuild the kernel. I don't think that distributors release
the kernels for each policy.
Instead of Kconfig, how about using proc filesystem. e.g. kdump_safe.
If kdump_safe is 1, crash notifier will not be called.
If kdump_safe is 0, crash notifier will be called.
