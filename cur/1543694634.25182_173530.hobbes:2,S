Works fine for me.
btw. is it possible to do not use initrd with some fs and instead use external 
initramfs image?
I've tried to create initramfs image with unpacking initrd image, mounting it 
over loop and creating cpio archive from that (find . | cpio -o -c > 
../x.cpio), gzipping that cpio and placeing it instead of old initrd at 
/boot/initrd + lilo reload. 
It doesn't work that way unfortunately (test8 with your patch).
