The thing is, I hate encouraging glibc's behaviour of "we'll make up our
own structures", and then ask the kernel to fix it later when it was done
wrong in glibc. This is a totally new format that is totally unnecessary,
and the RIGHT thing to do is to have glibc just use the proper 64-bit
format.
In other words, why doesn't glibc ever just make a new major number and
make its "struct dirent" be the 64-bit version? It is _ridiculous_ to
carry this baggage around, and then complain and add MORE baggage to the
kernel because of having done things wrong the first time around.
