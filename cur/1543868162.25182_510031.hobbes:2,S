+ * The UBI Eraseblock Association (EBA) unit.
+ *
+ * The main goal of this unit is to maintain the Eraseblock Association Table
+ * (EBA table). The EBA table is a data structure which maps (volume ID,
+ * logical eraseblock number) pairs to physical eraseblock numbers.
+ *
+ * Note, it is supposed that all the UBI input/output goes via the EBA unit.
+ * The only reservation should be made for the initialization time when
+ * different units may directly do input/output from physical eraseblocks.
+ *
+ * Although in this implementation the EBA table is fully kept and managed in
+ * RAM, which assumes poor UBI scalability, it might be (partially) maintained
+ * on flash in future implementations.
