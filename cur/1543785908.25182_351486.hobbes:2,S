I assumed dynamic priorities affected the length of the
quantum, but maybe it just changes the number of times
the process is scheduled wrt other processes, with the
quantum being fixed at 20-30ms.
(...a few seconds later...)
Skimming through sched.c, it seems my first guess was
right: the quantum varies with the priority from 5ms
to 800ms.
The DEF_TIMESLICE of 400ms looks a bit too gross for
most applications and the maximum 800ms is just
ridicolously high.
IIRC, the 7.14MHz 68000 in the Amiga 500 did task-switching
at 20ms intervals, with a negligible performance hit.
Couldn't do much better on today's CPUs?
