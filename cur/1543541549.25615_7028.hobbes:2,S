Yes. But I do agree 100% with Al on the fact that _that_ kind of thing
should be a user action rather than automatic. So you'd have to do
	mount -t ctar files.tar.gz files.tar.gz
first before the above would work.

Hey, that is an implementation issue, not a design issue, so that's the
point where I don't care all that much any more. I'd not be all that
likely to use this feature (I still do "zcat < file.tar.gz | tar xvf -"
instead of using "tar zxvf file.tar.gz", because I'm an olfashioned old
fogey. I don't need my tar-files auto-mounted for me).
