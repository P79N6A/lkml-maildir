"nolock" only turns of fcntl()/lockf()-style remote locking.
Local locking still works, as does flock() which is _always_ local-only.
(So never use flock() on Linux for a mail folder).
Mail programs like Mutt and Elm use another kind of locking for mail
folders in addition to fcntl(): dot-locking.  This involves creating
additional empty files.  When done properly, the _locks_ sequence
properly over NFS, but Linux may still cache stale contents of the
_mailbox_ itself.  "actimeo=0" fixes the latter problem.

Yes it's cache problems.  Solution: "actimeo=0" mount option fixes this
too.  Performance penalty (more network traffic), which is why I prefer
to use fcntl() locking and have a working rpc.lockd at both ends.

It is working nice (no errors), but probably losing mail from time to
time.  The test is:
