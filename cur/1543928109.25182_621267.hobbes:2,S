This patch is needed to preserve legacy behavior when
CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES=y.  Without this patch, xinit can't
kill X, so manually starting X in runlevel 3 then exiting your window
manager will not cause X to exit. 
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] file capabilities: don't prevent signaling setuid root programs.
An unprivileged process must be able to kill a setuid root
program started by the same user.  This is legacy behavior
needed for instance for xinit to kill X when the window manager
exits.
When an unprivileged user runs a setuid root program in !SECURE_NOROOT
mode, fP, fI, and fE are set full on, so pP' and pE' are full on.
Then cap_task_kill() prevents the user from signaling the setuid root
task.  This is a change in behavior compared to when
!CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES.
This patch introduces a special check into cap_task_kill() just
to check whether a non-root user is signaling a setuid root
program started by the same user.  If so, then signal is allowed.
Changelog:
	Nov 26: move test up above CAP_KILL test as per Andrew
		Morgan's suggestion.
