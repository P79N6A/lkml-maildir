The patch st is not necessary now but I don't think it would be a bad idea 
to include it anyway. My reasoning is based on that the patch is very 
inexpensive, it basically moves freeing of an array to another place. 
The reasons for inclusion are:
- someone reviewing the code may wonder why the change to 2.6.15.x is
  not in 2.6.x >= 16; 2.6.16 would need at least a comment about this
- it does decouple st from any dependencies about what happens to
  the s/g array at the lower levels
- if the s/g array will at some future time be again passed directly to 
  dma mapping, we would not face the problem again
I don't have any firm opinion either way.
