Subject: kernel crash on damaged disk

Hallo kernel developers,
I have found following bug in kernel (2.2.0-pre7, but also more versions ago):
I have obtained damaged ZIP disk.
When I have been writing to damaged zone, system had totally frozen.
No messages on syslog files was found after cold reboot.
Configuration:
ext IOMEGA ZIP SCSI
AHA 152x SCSI "aha152x=0x340,12,7,1"
VFAT FS
-- Stanislav Brabec
P.S.: I am not able to repeat this bug, the disk is after trying low level format
damaged totally, but was repeated twice before with different kernels
(several months ago and now). (If anybody can help with disk reformat, let me know :-)
Similar crash I have obtained long time ago, when I have removed mounted floppy
while writing.
