We do not want per-flow multipathing. We want per connection multipathing with fast route lookups (that's why we have all routes in the cache). That is exactly what we implemented. Our tests prove that a connection keeps its route as long as it lives (the dstentry remains associated with the socket). That's why I do not really
understand why our approach hurts long lasting connections in any way. Can you explain your point more precisely?
