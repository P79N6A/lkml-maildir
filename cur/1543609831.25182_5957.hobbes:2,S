At which level do you want the read ahead?
If you read ahead at the block level, you may not get data for the file you
want because of fragmentation.  This is especially true with long running
Reiser file systems.
If you read ahead at the FS level, you could get even more seeking because
of fragmentation.
Also, you need enough memory to let the kernel hold the read ahead data long
enough to be used.
