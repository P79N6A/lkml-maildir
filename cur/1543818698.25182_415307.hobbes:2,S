The addresses are a valid physical range. The caution should be that
filter_rsvd_memory converts the addresses from identity mapped to
physical. efi_memmap_walk calls back to function with identity mapped
addresses. What you've done seems okay.
BTW - I like want you are attempting to achieve.

Yes that helps because of granules and it boots.  The patch below is applied 
on top of your original post. But..

Page free/avail accounting is off and I'm done for tonight. I believe it's how 
you treat holes but haven't looked closely yet.
Let me wrap my head around this code again. It's been some time.
