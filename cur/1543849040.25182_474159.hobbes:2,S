It was also favoured by some of us as well. In addition this whole issue
was extensively debated in the past to select the current approach. That
said I do like the approach of a short wait *specifically* on power
transitions, its bounded in time, its neat and it makes sense. 
We must be very very sure its never triggered in the real world any
other way (eg your >block testing must be impossible)
So unless you distinguish between "back in a moment", "back someday" and
"not coming back" it isn't useful. Thus your patch is incomplete as it
does not provide the cache that is also needed. At least I don't think X
hanging forever mid mode switch is terribly useful...

Gak that is IMHO a mistake. Just keep a counter. You've just added
another "what the hell do I do if this returns -EBUSY" problem for all
the driver authors.

NAK for all the above reasons. This is a cure looking for a disease, and
its a cure which is worse than the theoretical disease it wants to fix.
