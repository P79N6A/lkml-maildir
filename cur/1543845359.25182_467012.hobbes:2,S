And careful reading of the Fedora scripts shows how to provide your
own custom kernel/initrd pair. Setting the right variable in the right
config file will use that - if it's unset, it will go with a kernel
named ${kernelversion}kdump.

I'm definitely submitting a doc patch to explain all this in more detail, as
soon as I get it figured out enough. ;)

Well, the stripped down kernel is right around 2M.  Unfortunately, I need
to run lvm.static, which is another 1.5M at least.  So unless busybox has
grown support for LVM, I'm looking at 8M at best.
Another stupid question - I see how the first kernel gets the 'crashkernel='
parameter and knows how much space there is.  But if you set it to 32M@16M,
how does the kdump kernel know it only has 32M?  Or does it just start at
the 16M line, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't go over the 48M line
and start corrupting the dump?
