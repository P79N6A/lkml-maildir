getting a good trace of it is easy: pick up the latest -rt kernel from:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
enable EVENT_TRACING in that kernel, run the workload 
and do:
	scripts/trace-it > to-ingo.txt
and send me the output. It will be large but interesting. That should 
get us a whole lot closer to what happens. A (much!) more finegrained 
result would be to also enable FUNCTION_TRACING and to do:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/mcount_enabled
before running trace-it.
