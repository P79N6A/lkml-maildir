Absolutely.  I sent the patch to put the USB etc. tables back in
(merged in .48 IIRC).
Hopefully this is back together: the device-table-to-aliases stuff is
a separate step which can be argued on its own, and I think will
probably have to wait for 2.7 unless Greg is going to champion it.
The real win is simplicity and independence from the kernel
datastructures (which probably won't change during 2.6 anyway).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
