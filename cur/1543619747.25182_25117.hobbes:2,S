Subject: Quick question about i8xx RNG.

For the last handful of kernels (2.4.16, 2.4.17, a few 2.4 -pre's, 
2.5.2-dj5, -dj6, and 2.5.3-dj1), attempting to insert i810_rng gives "no 
such device."  I know this is a 81x chipset system (Sony VAIO R505JE) 
[lspci reports it as a "82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory 
Controller Hub" along with its other functions].
So the question is thus: is this correct?  Is there supposed to be a RNG 
with all 8xx chipsets [this is what I've heard.... if so, why does 
module init fail?] or is it an option and I just don't have it?
