I guess I see it as more of a map of the jungle as I (and my co-authors)
see it.  A guide to New York does not automatically open all of the doors
of the city to you; should a guide to certain parts of the kernel be
different?  
There was an informative article in Phrack a while back on how to install
code into a running kernel via /dev/kmem.  I guess that must be a
documented API too, now.
