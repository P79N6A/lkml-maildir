Just so I'm sure I'm not misunderstanding, are you promising me that I
will never get bitten on the ass on any architecture with kernel code
that assumes the compiler will never add padding as long as struct
fields are naturally aligned to their size? :-)
For example, you're saying I'm definitely safe declaring a structure
(used as a HW descriptor) like say
	struct mthca_qp_path {
		u32 port_pkey;
		u8  rnr_retry;
		u8  g_mylmc;
		u16 rlid;
		u8  ackto;
		u8  mgid_index;
		u8  static_rate;
		u8  hop_limit;
		u32 sl_tclass_flowlabel;
		u8  rgid[16];
	};
without __attribute__((packed))?  (Of course I'll only use this struct
aligned to its size)
Thanks,
  Roland
