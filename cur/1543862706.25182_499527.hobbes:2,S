Subject: [PATCH 1/3] make static counters in new_inode and iunique be 32 bits
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/16/211

When a 32-bit program that was not compiled with large file offsets does a
stat and gets a st_ino value back that won't fit in the 32 bit field, glibc
(correctly) generates an EOVERFLOW error. We can't do anything about fs's
with larger permanent inode numbers, but when we generate them on the fly,
we ought to try and have them fit within a 32 bit field.
This patch takes the first step toward this by making the static counters in
these two functions be 32 bits.
