No it isn't, in fact there are several ways to do it. Just by searching
this list you should be able to find them.

magicdev is a piece of crap.

That's not the way to do it. For drives that support media status event
reporting you don't lock the drive, you just intercept the eject
request. And at that time you check if you can umount /cdrom (or
whatever) - if that suceeds, you send an eject request to the drive.
This will work with any drive made in the last few years. You can also
check out MS media status notification, I think you can even find that
document on microsoft.com.
I think you need to spend a little more time thinking/researching this
problem. At least it really looks like you are going about it all wrong.
