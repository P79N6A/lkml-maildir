Not necessarily. For a write to a disk file, it would be an error to return a
short write except in an error situation. For devices, the rules are looser.
Quoting Stevens APUE p.406, "Some devices, notably terminals, networks, and any
SVR4 streams devices have the following two properties.
...
2 A write operation can also return less that we specified. This may be caused
by flow control constraints by downstream modules, for example. Again it's not
an error, and we should continue writing the remainder of the data. (Normally
this short return from a write only occurs with a nonblocking descriptor or if
a signal is caught."
So, whilst I personally find drivers that return a short write without
O_NONBLOCK set to be rather obnoxious, it's not illegal, and you have to code
accordingly :-)
