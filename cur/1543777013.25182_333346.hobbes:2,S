The tty code doesn't work like that.  You must know how many ports
you want right from the start.  You can't dynamically add new ports
to an already registered driver without first unregistering all the
existing ports, unregistering the driver, adjusting the number of
ports, reregistering the driver and all the ports.
If you've got one already open, your only option in that case is to
ignore any attempt to add new ports.
Obviously this is not acceptable.  So please don't try to dictate
what serial should do.  It does things the way it does them to work
around other bits of the kernel which are lacking in various ways.

Correct.

Which were?
It works for me on my platforms here, and everyone else on x86.  I
even had a situation where I had NR_UARTS set to 64 but only one
registered... which also worked fine with no extraneous kernel
messages.
