Hi Stefano,
the cause for this problem is NOT a linux kernel bug, but an
incompatibility between the ibmtr.c of 2.2.x and ibmtr_cs.c of pcmcia.
Please check the PCMCIA beta forum for more information or contact 
Mike Phillips <phillim@amtrak.com> for a patch to make the card work again
under 2.2.x.
Cheers,
Jochen
