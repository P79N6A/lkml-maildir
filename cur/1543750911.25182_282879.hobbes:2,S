When iptables went in, they computed reasonable dates for the final demise
of ipfwadm and ipchains compatibility. IIRC, both came out as March, 2004.

Backward compatibility is important. Sure, under the old development model
it would have been "deprecate <feature> in 2.<2n>, axe it at the start of
2.<2n+1>, by 2.<2n+2> it is gone".

A public call won't get to that single user, or she is simply too lazy to
answer. Axe it, and they scream. That is much more effective. Besides,
that way she looks for help (and surely finds a kind soul helping out with
migrating). Or stays put (2.4 is still alivve...).

Minix is a nice example, doesn't interfere with other work and is no great
maintainance burden. I guess it'll stay.

Nope. The change had its very good reasons.

What's the beef then?

AFAIR, the only public APIs broken have been for exclusive use by utilities
tightly coupled to the kernel (module handling, firewall), and those during
development series. If you fool around with development kernels, you are
supposed to be prepared for such breakage. Normal users get insulated by
their respective distributions.

List the offending changes for us all to contemplate, please.

Distributions (or final users) are free to undo offending changes.

Tough luck. If it is closed source, whoever builds it is responsible for
making it work. If they don't keep it working for your preferred setup,
it's the price _you_ pay for closed source + bleeding edge. LKML has no way
of helping you there.
