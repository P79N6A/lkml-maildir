It's a shame this wasn't reported earlier.

Please confirm that the problem is observed on the NFS client and not the
NFS server?  I'll assume the client.
What other filesystems are in use on the client?
Please describe the NFS mount options and the number of CPUs and the amount
of memory in the machine.  And please send me your .config, off-list.
Thanks.
