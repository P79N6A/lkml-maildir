The above dd command wipes out out the partition table anyway,
with or without EZdrive. I think it also kills the EZdrive code.
EZdrive tends to come installed by default, to support DOS and
similar crufty Microsoft bits. For a pure Linux system it should
be removed.
What you are arguing for is protecting root from himself.
You want to limit the rope, but this is silly as the partitions
themselves are still completely unprotected.
The "1 0 2 3 4" order is nicely 1-to-1, unlike the other orders.

This is a pain. The fdisk program ought to have a "wipe EZdisk"
option. More generally, it ought to let the user wipe everything
of a similar nature, by both brute force and by copying the second
sector over the first.
