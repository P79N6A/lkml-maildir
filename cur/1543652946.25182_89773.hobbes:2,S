  What is means is Alan is doing a thankless job fixing the current ide 
mess.  The ac 2.4/2.5 trees are being used to test a number of updates. 
 If you can provide Alan good bug report on the issue in 2.4.20-rc1-ac2. 
 He will take a look at fixing the code.  I think the info he needs 
would be:
-The ide section of dmesg or all of dmesg
-output of hdparm -vi /dev/hd(whatever)
-result of hdparm -d 1 /dev/hd(whatever)
