Changes:
- a couple more macros for big endian machines in byteorder/swab.h (eg. hdparm 
on big endian machines should build)
- missing include in linux/aio_abi.h added (don't remember what didn't build 
because of this)
- removed a conflict between linux/if.h and glibc headers
I should be releasing 2.6.6.0 now, but I do not have enough time till the end 
of May, and the last bug in the above list proved to be a little too popular 
(at least that's what the number of bug reports would suggest). Since I've 
accidentally introduced it myself in the previous release, I can't force all 
those people to patch the thing by hand because of my mistakes :)
