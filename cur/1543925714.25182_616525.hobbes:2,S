Different ABIs clearly have to be handled, but I don't think that is a 
huge deal.  The i387 code overall (not just asm/i387.h) is very 
different, though, and I find it unlikely that a properly unified code 
is going to be ready and working in the 2.6.24 timeframe.  I'm exploring 
if a partial merge with high confidence level is feasible; either way, a 
proper merge for 2.6.25 is probably the right thing.
