it is supposed to provide an ability to easy modify filesystem behaviour

list of features reiser4 does not have now:
O_DIRECT support - we are working on it now
various block size support
quota support
xattrs and acls
list of warnings about reiser4 code:
I think that last big list of useful comments (from Christoph Hellwig
<hch@infradead.org>) is addressed. Well, except for one minor (I
believe) place in file release.
Currently, Andrew is trying to find some time to review reiser4 code.
