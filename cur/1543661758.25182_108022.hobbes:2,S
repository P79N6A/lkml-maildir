Alright...
I know that some Dells (although I can't say whether yours is one) do their
ACPI by calling back into Dell SMM calls -- which takes the processor away
from linux for a significant amount of time; enough to cause clock
slippage, and loss of mouse data. And I'm guessing an ACPI battery monitor
polls at a fairly short interval, so, it could be related.
