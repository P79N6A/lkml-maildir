The issue here is I was looking at it from a new interfaces perspective,
and not from a legacy interfaces perspective.  However, for new
interfaces we want the opposite -- properly aligned elements -- so
please disregard previous objection.
However, I'm still thinking it might be worthwhile to consider the
__i[us]64 typedefs previously discussed as a way to avoid alignment
bloopers in new interfaces.
