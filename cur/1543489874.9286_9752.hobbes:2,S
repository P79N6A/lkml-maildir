Dear Webmaster,
I was searching the web and found your web site to be of interest to 
my clients customers. It looks like you get a lot of web traffic and have 
many products that are of great demand to your customers. By combining our 
efforts we may be able to increase web traffic going to both of our 
web sites.  
My client site specializes in quality sexual enhancement products. The site is geared 
toward consumers who want to enhance their sex life. The web site addresses 
nutritional and psychological aspects of sexuality. My clients site is 
for adults only and is not pornographic. The site has an online reference guide, 
free chat site(coming soon), news and information service, free software and links 
to other sexually interesting resource sites.
The sexual products featured on the site are geared toward the consumer 
who wants to make an informed decision regarding their sexual issues. Each 
sexual product is backed by scientific research. On line brochures describe 
sexual issues, products and research studies in easy to understand terms. Featured 
products may help or enhance sex, sexual intercourse, impotency and pre-ejaculation. 
Visitors can browse by product name or by health category. 
If you would like me to contact you regarding a profitable alliance
between our two web sites please email me so I may forward your name to my client.
Your Health Care Professional,
Lisa P
