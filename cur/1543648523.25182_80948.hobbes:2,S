Converting things to module_init() is certainly a good thing, but having 
to provide fake init functions for modules which don't need them doesn't 
look so nice.
Did you consider just generating the info you need unconditionally in 
include/linux/module.h and then removing duplicates for multi-part modules 
using ld's link-once (I didn't try that yet, but it seems doable and would 
also remove duplicated .modinfo.kernel_version strings and the like)
