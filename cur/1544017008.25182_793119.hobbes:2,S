no difference ... i must admit, i already spent some time, trying to
revert the specific changes of this commit ... i gave up to wait for
some help from someone, who actually knows how the code is working ...
possibly it makes sense to compile a full kernel of the first bad kommit
and introduce the different changes one by one ... i will try to find
some time for this during the next few days ...
but if you have more patches, that i can test, please let me know ...
cheers, tim
