Hi,
I'm proud to present Software Suspend v6.
It can be downloaded from
http://falcon.sch.bme.hu/~seasons/linux/swsusp.html
We think that the code is ready for the masses and I'm going to ask Linus to
include this patch in the next release.
Linus, if you read this and would like to take a quick look at the code then I
may send it to you directly in plain text if you ask me to.
The program of course lacks of some features but these are not so essential.
Please read the documentation to get known what are these problems.
Feedback is welcome.
Please reply to: seasons@falcon.sch.bme.hu or to the swsusp-list
ChangeLog:
v5-v6:
o	Network device state saving/restoring
o	Change virtual console so running X and svgalib programs survive,
	however my X console went blank when I tried to suspend while running
	X and tried to restore text screen resolution by svgatextmode.
o	Documentation update
o	Introduced DEBUG_SLOW #define
o       Fixed DEBUG macros
o       Modified SAVE/RESTORE registers. No need for saving e[a-d]x but
	I use mb() now. Maybe this will fix the bug what egcs causes.
o       Updated 'things to implement' section in Documentation/swsusp.tex
o       suspend.* renamed to swsusp.*
o       Fixed screen saving/restoring
o       Code cleanup
