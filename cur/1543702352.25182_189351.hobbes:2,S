For laptops, it's often most interesting to find out _what_ process
dirtied what data (which in turn caused bdflush to sync it), or what
process keeps doing small reads. And block_dump does exactly that (it
was invented for exactly that purpose :)

I don't think you understand what Bert is looking for. He explicitly
mentions that the machine is very idle, so he's probably looking for
culprits that spin up the drive occasionally.
It doesn't provide tcpdump like logs of course, that's far more
invasive.
