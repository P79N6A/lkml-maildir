Looks like your SCSI tape drive is getting hung and has grabbed the
bus <forever>.
Finally, the SCSI driver makes the last-ditch effort by aborting
everything and resetting the bus.

Now you have a device not-ready.

And the device is now becoming ready.

Maybe your drive can't handle the synchronous speed? Maybe it's too
hot? Maybe anything. The kernel code __seems__ to be trying its
hardest to handle a problem with the drive. The new kernel may
be slightly faster in its transfer-rate, triggering a latent problem
with the drive. I'd first try backing off on the sync-speed (through
the SCSI BIOS).
