This selinux code is checking to see if the current process still has
access rights to it's controlling tty, right? If it doesn't tty and
tty_old_pgrp are nulled out. Does this need locking? Can you
disassociate a task like this by nulling out tty, what about the child
tasks in the session if it is the leader?

        struct fdtable *fdt;
        long j = -1;
        if (tty) {
                file_list_lock();
                file = list_entry(tty->tty_files.next, typeof(*file),
f_u.fu_list);
                if (file) {

                           than using file_has_perm, as this particular open
                           file may belong to another process and we are only
                           interested in the inode-based check here. */
