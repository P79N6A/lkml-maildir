Subject: Intel NIC driver and SIOCGMIIPHY? (Warning! maybe stupid question!)

Hi,
I am trying to access Intel NIC (10/100) internal data using ioctl () with
SIOCGMIIPHY and SIOCDEVPRIVATE command parameters (the kernel is 2.4.18 with
some patches). The SIOCGMIIPHY does not passed to the driver, while the
SIOCDEVPRIVATE  does. Why?
In the original Intel driver (e100) there is no case for SIOCDEVPRIVATE in
e100_ioctl(), so this access method is not working. The eepro100 driver has
the same case for both these commands (in speedo_ioctl()), so it works. Is
this problem caused by kernel itself?
What is interesting, that the Intel Gigabit NIC Linux driver (e1000) does
not allow access to internal registers at all.
Thanks
Kosta
