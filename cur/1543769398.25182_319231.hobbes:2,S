Yea, but in addition to the multiplication for the check it would duplicate
significant part of filemap:
- generic_file_read           => xip_file_read
- generic_file_aio_read    => xip_file_aio_read
- __generic_file_aio_read => __xip_file_aio_read
- generic_file_sendfile     => xip_file_sendfile
- generic file_readv          => xip_file_readv
- generic_file_write          => xip_file_write
- generic_file_aio_write_nolock => xip_file_write_nolock
- __generic_file_write_nolock => __xip_file_write_nolock
- generic_file_write_nolock => xip_file_write_nolock
- generic_file_aio_write => xip_file_aio_write
- generic_file_mmap => xip_file_mmap
- generic_file_readonly_mmap => xip_file_readonly_mmap
All changes to these functions would need to be mirrored, and the binary
kernel images with xip enabled would grow by the size of those functions.
But given that the copies of those function would be equivalent to their
original, I honestly think that duplicating them is worse then splitting
the read/write pathes at where handling is in fact different:
- mapping_read
- nopage
- generic_file_write
- truncate page
