Reading the asm of sched.o jiffies is dereferenced in the code exactly at
0x72 bytes after the start of schedule_timeout(). So the oops happened
really while dereferencing jiffies. I can't see why the address didn't
matched with jiffies. But even if the address would be wrong you shouldn't
get an Oops running such asm instruction with the kernel pagetable that
it's fine.
So I suggest replacing memory or CPU.
