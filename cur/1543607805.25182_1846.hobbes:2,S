I noticed that I need a pseudodevice that opens normally but blocks all
reads (and writes). The only way out would be through a signal. Neither
/dev/zero nor /dev/null block, but is there some other standard device
that would do the job?
If there isn't, writing such a pseudodevice would be trivial. What
should it be called? Any chance of including that in the kernel?
