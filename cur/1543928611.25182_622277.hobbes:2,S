Well, no, but that's not the point.
You're not addressing the substance of this specific issue, which is
simply whether rdmsr/wrmsr and pmd_val/make_pmd are actually internal
interfaces that drivers have no business in using, or are they
legitimate interfaces?  If not, then what interface *should* drivers be
using to do these things?  They seem like perfectly reasonable things
for a driver to want to do, and I don't see any inherent problem with
these interfaces.
It's not like we need to curtail these interfaces for any technical
reason.  It's pretty much the arbitrary result of me choosing to type
"_GPL" rather than leaving it off.  Refusing to correct what amounts to
a typo seems petty.
