Ubuntu has CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND=y
There are probably lots of other distros that use it as well.
This new behaviour (failed operation of USB flash keys) is a *new* regression
in 2.6.23, and we still have time to fix it by either reverting the changed
functionality, or by changing the code to default OFF.
Here's my patch for 2.6.23-rc6+ :
Fix USB Storage failures.
