There appears to be at least one bug (that is longstanding but might be 
made worse by the MSR stuff). However, that one should matter only with 
preemption enabled. What's your configuration?
Also, do you actually have a new library that uses SYSENTER (ie recent 
redhat beta), and whct kind of CPU do you have?
