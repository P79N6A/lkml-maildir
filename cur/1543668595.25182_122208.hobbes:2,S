Hi all,
Can anyone tell me why both i2c_probe() and i2c_detect() are in the
kernel at the same time?  They both almost do the same thing, with the
exception being i2c_detect() can handle i2c devices on the isa bus.
It kind of looks like the older i2c code and drivers used the
i2c_probe() call, while the lm_sensors code used i2c_detect().
If there are no objections, I'll merge the two of them, cutting about 2k
out of the kernel :)
thanks,
greg k-h
