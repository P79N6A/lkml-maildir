Alexey,
Thanks for the clarification on the pingpong behaviour!
Some more questions..

So I understand that we're allowing pingpong to retain state of whether
it makes sense to delay right now or not, based on whats been happening,
and trying to avoid a delayed ack timer expiry..
But...

Then whats the point of TCP_QUICKACK socket option at all? If its only
a user hint that gets erased on the first go through, that is one full system call just
 to avoid a delay on one packet. The user isnt going to write an application full of
setsockopt() calls based on his data sends, right?

True, this is an abuse of TCP :). But we should have the freedom to do so, right? :)
i.e. User may need to send small amounts of data at a time.  The user might even
want to have that data sent out immediately, and not want  the kernel to delay the send.
After all, if the application is sending down large full frames, the kernel is by default
not going to be halted by Nagle. Its really  only when you are sending small packets
at a time that youre affected by Nagle and might want to set NODELAY, especially
if that application is highly interactive?.
thanks,
Nivedita
