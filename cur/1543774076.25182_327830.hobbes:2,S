I am running the 2.6.12 kernel on my Athlon64 workstation. I am using
the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop keyboard and mice. Every now
and then my system becomes unresponsive to the input devices. I can
still login remotely and my dmesg is full of the following message:
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: input irq status -75 received
I have filed this bug at bugme.osdl.org the bug number is 4724.
