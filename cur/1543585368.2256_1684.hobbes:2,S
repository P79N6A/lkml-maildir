Subject: [PATCH] RFC: Network driver info to userspace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In various scenarios where userland needs to interact with hardware,
userland often needs to know exactly what driver (and driver version) is
currently running on a given interface.  Hotplugging and other
applications could -really- use the ability to find out bus information
for a given interface.  Firmware
So I propose the attached addition to the ethtool interface.  It adds a
new structure with several ASCII text fields, which are filled in at the
driver's discretion.  Userland then interprets these fields for their
own evil designs.
Currently (AFAIK) for all kernel interfaces, userland has no reliable
way to associate a hardware device with a kernel interface, or a driver
with a kernel interface[1].  Since we have no generic register_driver()
interface, solving this problem means implementing a domain-specific
solution like I have done here...
