Why? The obvious solution has always appeared to be to just get rid of
info files.
The "info" interface makes sense only to people who grok GNU emacs, and if
you actually want to be user-friendly you either use "man" (because that's
how everything else is documented and then you could actually just tell
people to use man everywhere) or you use HTML (because that's a _useful_
format that even non-emacsheads can understand).
