Now I pvmoved one PE which contains areas of the filesystem with errors
to a different drive. Surprise: e2fsck is now able to correct these
errors. Block bitmap differences in other PEs are still not fixed.
This strengthens my assumption that this is not a e2fsck problem, but
an LVM or IDE one.
Are there any known problems with huge hard disks (250GB) on Promise
IDE?
