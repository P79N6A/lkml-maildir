If you apply the "read block from disk" method to a RAID1 array, how
you do you know whether you mean:
1) An active disk in the array
2) The actual array itself.
Hint: With Raid 1, the disks are complete images of each other.  You can
mount a single disk which is/was part of a raid 1 array and read all data
off it.
If someone thinks about going down this road, make sure you check the
multiple-device arrays BEFORE the physical disks!
