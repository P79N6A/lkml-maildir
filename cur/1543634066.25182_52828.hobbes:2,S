Except that as I recall, that's not practical for all devices; they may not
have built in IDs.  Hence there need to be topology-based IDs available.
Which is why I had pointed out usb_make_path() ... which returns a stable
controller ID for the "CBTU tuple".  It isn't going to get re-assigned by
changing the bus probe sequence or driver load order.  Even PCI has better
IDs available than those simple numbers (pci_device.slot_name).
If the driverfs names for all devices are supposed to be using stable IDs
(ones that don't change unless at least the hardware gets re-configured)
where possible, then those driverfs names will be better answers for the
"what is this device's topological ID" than those purely numeric CBTU tuples.
(And they won't address the volume/media/... ID level problems, which are
of course a separate issue.)
