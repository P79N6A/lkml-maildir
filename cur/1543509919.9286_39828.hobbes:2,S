Because linux uses ultra-secret 100% compression invisible patented 
algorithm to compress its kernels. <joking>
Seriously, 
Let see, I assume you compiled it on PC style machine, but this is not
the only architecture which linux support. checking the architecture
directory shows that a chunk of code is used by other platforms like
Alpah or Sun.. those won't go into the kernel you compiled.
eax:/usr/src/Linux/23/linux# du -sh arch/*
711K    arch/alpha
817K    arch/arm
979K    arch/i386
2.0M    arch/m68k
920K    arch/mips
1.5M    arch/ppc
164K    arch/sh
1.2M    arch/sparc
1.2M    arch/sparc64
Furthermore there are tons of drivers, for PC's and other arechitecture,
I doubt you compiled them all. As you can see they account for around 50%
of sources.
eax:/usr/src/Linux/23/linux# du -sh drivers 
35M     drivers
The image itself is compressed (not as 100% as I suggested above
but still), 
[adam@pepsi HOWTO]$ du -sh /boot/vmlinux-2.3.18ac5 /lib/modules/2.3.18ac4/ /boot/vmlinuz-2.3.18ac5 
2.5M    /boot/vmlinux-2.3.18ac5
1.3M    /lib/modules/2.3.18ac4			< uncompressed kernel
982k    /boot/vmlinuz-2.3.18ac5			< compressed kernel
so the end binary size is : around 4 mb. 
In the end machine executable code always will be more compact that human
readable code (at very least b/c lack of comments). for small programs
binary is bigger becuase of overhead of starup code, but once source code
gets big, the proportions reverse.
