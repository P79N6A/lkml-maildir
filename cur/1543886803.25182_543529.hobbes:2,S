I think I would put something like this:
/* Author, of form NAME[, NAME]*[ and NAME]
 * If you have a permanent email address and are prepared for
   maintaining/supporting the module, you may want to provide
   the address as well */
The wording isn't the best I suppose.
I.e., the change would mean providing the address is not strictly
required and the person should think when adding it, that's all.
