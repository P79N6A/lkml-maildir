If we can design ppoll() any way we like, which seems likely, I would
prefer having the timeout given as an absolute timestamp. It would
save some gettimeofday() (or clock_gettime()) syscalls and simplify
user code in common cases.
If I'm not mistaken, sem_timedwait() and pthread_cond_timedwait() were
designed to take an absolute timeout for this reason.
