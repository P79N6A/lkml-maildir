I had 2 crashes within minutes of eachother on our Primary and Secondary
name servers.  All those machines are doing is running BIND, and both are
identical machines.  Its 4am, and I had to copy the oops from the console
onto paper, and so I left out some of it (sorry I was tired, I will get it
all next time), here is what I had:
kmem_free: Bad obj addr (objp = c4110b80, name = size-128)
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0002
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c011e3c9>]
EFLAGS: 00010202
eax: 00000039   ebx: c0373140   ecx: c0202000   edx: ffffff9d
esi: c3549e00   edi: 00000202   ebp: 00000001   esp: c0203e1c
ds: 0018   es: 0018   ss: 0018
Process swapper (pid: 0, process nr: 0, stackpage=c0203000)
From my System.map, the EIP line points to:
c011e244 T kfree
Does anyone know if this is a known issue and what the suggested rememdy
is?
Brian
