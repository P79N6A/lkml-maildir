And a long-standing one. This should have been fixed in 2.2, it has not
been fixed in 2.4, it's much desired for 2.6 -- and people are going to
point away from Linux (and expect Jörg Schilling speaking up again
should 2.6 be released with what he considers broken API -- I cannot
tell if all his items are right, but if a third of what he says is true,
Linux SCSI is not in good shape).
