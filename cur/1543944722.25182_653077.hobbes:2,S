On at least two Dell optiplex 755 systems with a Core 2 Duo I get
Feb 13 15:14:01 inari CPU 1: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004 
Feb 13 15:14:01 inari CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000005

2.6.22.10 shows the problem, 2.6.24.2 ditto but I'm unable to reproduce
it with 2.6.24-rc8. BIOS upgrade didn't help. Removing all PCI[e] cards
didn't help either.
Does it make sense to try to pinpoint the problem to a particular
changeset (using git bisect I guess but I've never used it) or is the
hardware just broken?
