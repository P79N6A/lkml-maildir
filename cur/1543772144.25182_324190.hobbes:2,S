I did something for i386 which setup per node vector tables, i resurrected 
it for newer systems (ES7000) but haven't fixed MSI support yet. But that 
may not be what you're referring to ;)

This might be simpler if we did IRQ handling domains and setup a group of 
processors with the same vector tables. That way we just migrate onto one 
of the other cpus in the IRQ handling domain. This should also leave 
plenty of room for many devices per IRQ handling domain (my reference is 
a 4 processor per IRQ domain).
