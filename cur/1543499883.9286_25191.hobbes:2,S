I think you'll find both Linux and BSD are very object oriented when you
actually sit and think about them. Linux is a set of classes with virtual
methods.

Thats still hardly a model change. If you look at btree based fs's like OS/2
hpfs they fit straight into a unix vfs. I don't think you will find any
recent design large disk size targetted unix fs using linear directories.
