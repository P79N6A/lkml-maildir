Hello All,
    I am running the 2.4 kernel (latest from Fedora) on a Thinkpad 600E
laptop.  If I start the laptop with the AC adapter turned on, the CPU
frequency in /proc/cpuinfo is approximatly 400 MHz.  However, if I start
the laptop on battery power, /proc/cpuinfo  indicates a processor frequency
of approximatly 100 MHz.
    The frequency displayed in /proc/cpuinfo does not change if the AC
adapter is toggled on or off after the machine has booted.  It stays
in the same mode as it was booted into.  I am curious if this is because
the CPU frequency really is not changing, or if it is because the
number in /proc/cpuinfo is only calculated at boot.
Thanks,
Jim
