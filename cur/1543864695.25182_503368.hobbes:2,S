OK, one last reply before I give up on this thread...
Sure, Ralink drivers will get upstream eventually.  But by the time
the drivers get merged, Ralink will have stopped making the chips that
it supports (or so I read, 
http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/products/wireless/
)!
I don't think that taking a year or two to merge a driver is going to
impress a vendor, especially since the reverse-engineered Broadcom
wireless driver is probably going to go upstream at just about the
same time.
An uncharitable vendor might decide it's not worth publishing specs,
since the Linux guys can reverse engineer the Windows driver just as
fast anyway.
