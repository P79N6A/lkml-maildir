Maybe this is a stupid question, but why is LRO done at the device
driver level?
If it is a unversal performance benefit, I would have expected it to be
done generically, i.e. have all packets moved into network layer pass
through LRO instead.

In particular this bit looks like it should be driven by a timeout,
which would be settable via /proc/sys/net/core/lro_timeout or similar.
