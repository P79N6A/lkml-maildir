hi,
I am writting some kind of network device and I 
have following problem:
in the 
foo_xmit(struct sk_buff *skbp, struct device *dev)
routine I would need the netmask of the device. 
In the device driver book from A. Rubini I
found the hiden field "pa_mask", which I 
can not find any more in 2.2.x kernels.
can you please help me a hint where to look ?
thanks in advance, 
Gregor
