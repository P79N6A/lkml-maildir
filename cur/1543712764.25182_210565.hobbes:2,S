I know what the failure is due to, in general terms.  It's merging
arch/ppc/boot/prep/ into arch/ppc/boot/simple/ .  What I'm not so sure
about are the specific breakage, but I know it has to do with the
OpenFirmware code as it does work (or rather, it did when I submitted
it, and I'm going to verify that 2.6.5-rc3 stock does today) on my
Motorola PowerStack Series E (PPC1Bug, not OpenFirmware).
