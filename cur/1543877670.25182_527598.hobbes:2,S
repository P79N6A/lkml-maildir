Subject: [PATCH] doc/kernel-parameters: use IA-32 tag instead of i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/5/18

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Use documented tag for "IA-32" (not "i386") to indicate which
kernel parameters apply to IA-32.
