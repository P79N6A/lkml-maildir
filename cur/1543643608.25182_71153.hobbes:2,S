Sometimes people who maintain the code move on to other things. 
So, maintenance is sometimes required by people who do not have
"maintenance of this code" in their job description. When I'm paying
their salary, they get to fix other peoples code, even if it's none of
their business.
Now preferably such a fix would be passed through a maintainer who can
say (with his intimate knowledge of the code): "Oops, you're right
your patch is indeed an improvement".
If that's not possible, we'll have to make do with some testing.
