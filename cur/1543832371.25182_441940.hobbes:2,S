Greg, I just looked at the source for ps and it has a bunch of fixed
code for turning major/minor into /dev/name.  Isn't that something
udevinfo should be doing? But looking at the help for udevinfo I don't
see any way to turn a major/minor into /dev/name. The altermative
seems to be search /dev looking for the right device node.
