It uses an adaptive huffman scheme devised by David Wheeler, which usually
gets within 1% of the arithmetic coder that bzip1 used.
bzip2, especially the 1.0.X series, is superior to bzip1 in terms of speed,
memory use, robustness against bad-case inputs, recoverability of data 
from damaged compressed streams, and that it can be used as a library.
Moving back to bzip1 would IMO be a big step backwards.
