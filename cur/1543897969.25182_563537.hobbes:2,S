Jens Axboe wants to get references to the page structs behind
kmalloc() allocated pages in his networking splice work.
We pass scatterlists around, but networking buffers are
composed of a kmalloc()'d data header area for packet headers
and some of the initial packet data, then a true scatterlist
of page/offset/len triplets.
Splice wants to work with pages everwhere.
This is a reocurring theme, we should provide some kind of
solution to these issues instead of wishing they would go
away.
We could make a special allocator in the networking that carves
chunks out of pages but I'm sure you'll find that about as stupid
and wasteful as I do :-)
