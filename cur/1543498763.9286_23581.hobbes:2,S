this is what i suspected. If we are switching 450 threads that also do
some real work then we are trashing the cache _badly_ already, so pure
scheduling costs will not matter at all. Most systems (even loaded
servers) have typically less than 5 runnable processes. So those systems
will see 15% scheduling slowdown. Some applications might use many threads
- for those cases your patch is a nice improvement.
