It is normal for the Linux kernel, but not very programmer friendly. 
The abnormality of the Linux OS is that there are absolultely no 
standard OS services for dealing with the mouse and keyboard from a 
console in the manner that we need to. The keyboard services 
currently in the kernel are archaic, and not useful for event driven 
systems (hence the need to program the keyboard in raw mode).

You have just summed up the *exact* problem with the current scenario 
in Linux. All that stuff needs to be handled in user space, so any 
console apps that want to talk to the mouse and keyboard in a modern 
manner need to contain code that knows how to talk to every mouse 
device, and knows how to do code page translations for keyboard data.
When I say console apps, I am talking about SVGALib programs, the X11 
server, MGL programs, console libGGI programs and who knows what 
other programs (for instance the Rhide console programmers IDE). 
Every single one of those *applications* has the mouse and keyboard 
handling code duplicated within the program (or the shared library if 
the app links to shared libraries).
There should be a standard set of OS services (perhaps a beefed up 
userland daemon based on GPM, but I prefer it in the kernel) that 
*everyone* is expected to talk to. This way all apps can be easily 
extended to add support for new mice and keyboards without having to 
update the code for every project and deal with it that way.
As for GPM, the biggest problem with it is that it is always an 
optional component in Linux distributions. Hence not all systems have 
it installed, and hence you can't rely on it.

I have done all that, since that is how we have implemented our 
current support. But it bugs the hell out of me that we had to do 
that to begin with, and that when USB mice become prevalent we will 
have to add more code to our drivers to figure out how to manage this.
There is already joystick code in the Linux kernel, and an API for 
interfacing with this code. I feel very strongly that full keyboard 
and mouse handling *should* be in the Linux kernel. The keyboard 
handling is *already* in the kernel, it is just not powerful enough 
(no Linux app should ever have to read the keyboard in raw mode!).
As for mouse handling, the code to decode the mouse protocol 
information is not that complicated for each device, but the number 
of devices to support is already large and growing as USB becomes 
more prevalent. On top of that, the code that does the decoding of 
the mouse protocol really should be in the kernel so that the packets 
can be decoded at interrupt time and placed into the event queue.
