I spoke too fast.
Still get the errors:
[ 2311.980127] ata3: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 
0xb/00/00
[ 2311.980134] ata3: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
[ 2311.980138] ata3: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
But the drive speed is back to normal!
# hdparm -t /dev/sdc
/dev/sdc:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  154 MB in  3.01 seconds =  51.12 MB/sec
