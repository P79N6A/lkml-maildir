Two scsi drives in the machine (on a ncr875 card) and 2 nfs mounted
partitions from another machine. Also a floppy mounted (has tripwire
on it). Only IDE device in the machine is a IDE cdrom, thats almost
never in use.

The machine is fine and up, and I can do anything as long as it
doesn't call a sync or the like...
