Ack! Let's pick one:
Although the exact numbers of patches per time for a specific 
software manufacturer - let's pick Microsoft as an example - is not known, 
it is usually low (two for this *month* afaics), compared to what hits lkml 
*each day*.
Does that make their software more stable than Linux? I would have my 
doubts about that.
