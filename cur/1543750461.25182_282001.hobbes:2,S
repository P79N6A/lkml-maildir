[ update ]
Okay, tried to find out what is causing the kernel to crash and so I
replaced the dm-crypt part by cryptoloop: same effect.
Then I tried ext3 on top of LVM2 RAID5 with no encryption and it still
crashes. Not sure what is causing the problem exactly, but it does not
seem that dm-crypt is to blame anymore.
The message I saw on the remote console when it crashed with pure ext3
on raid5 was:
 Assertion failure in journal_start() at fs/jbd/transaction.c:271: "handle->h_transaction->t_journal == journal"
Hope this helps -- filed the bug as #3968 on buzilla.kernel.org, more
info at

Help appreciated, let me know if you have an idea.
Regards,
Georg
