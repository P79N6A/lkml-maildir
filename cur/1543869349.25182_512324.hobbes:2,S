hi
i have a SMP with 2x duo-core Opteron processors, and i have an ethernet card
(eth0). i want to balance the interrupts generated by the card to all 4
processors. i can do this by writing to smp_affinity, but on another machine it
get's done by "default", without doing anything.
is this irq balancing a feature in the chipset, or driver, or kernel ? i got
the idea of the smp_affinity stuff, and i've set it to "f", but nothing
happens, i mean i see only one CPU getting the interrupts.
i'm using kernel 2.6.18, but tried with 2.6.19, too.
thanks.
