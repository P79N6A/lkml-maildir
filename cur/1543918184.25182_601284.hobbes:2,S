I have rc8-git3 running on several machines, and I'm delighted to say 
that it powers down, reboots, and suspends to mem/disk without bothering 
to patch in suspend2. I saw the same message, but perhaps git3 had the 
fix, since machines go down correctly. I'm going to boot a laptop off CD 
  and try the rc9 on that to see if the wireless issues I had to patch 
around are fixed as promised. If so I'll go to the newest kernel for 
power saving.
