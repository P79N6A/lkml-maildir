Yep, and it never raises above that -- it doesn't jump around even after
a month.

I've scanned /proc to verify that all PIDs do not have an FD open to
/dev/random.  This was my first guess when this started -- some
developer was draining entropy in a while(1) loop.  I believe I went so
far as to go to runlevel 1 with nothing but sh and kernel threads.
That may not be comprehensive, so I'm open to other diagnostic tips.
And yes, /dev/urandom does continue to work, as expected.
Thanks!
