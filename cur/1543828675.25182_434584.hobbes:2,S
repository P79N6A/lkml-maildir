My Dear Friend, 
 I am interested in a partnership investment programme with your 
self/corporation. 
 There is this huge amount of Five million Seven hundred and fifthy 
thousand U.S dollars($5,750,000.00)which my late father kept in a 
security/financial company before he was assasinated by unknown persons, 
during a political crisis in my country. 
My father deposited it as a family treasure and that was before his 
death. 
Now I and mother left Angola to Senegal,through the help of my late 
father's good friend.Right now we are in refugee camp and 
wehave  decided to invest these money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside my country Angola and the whole of Africa for security and political reasons. 
We would want you to assist us to transfer this fund to your country 
for safty and investment purposes on the followings below: 
 1).Telecommunication 
 2).Manufacturing 
 3).Real Estate Business 
 If you  will be able of rendering an assistance to us we will 
adequately compensate you 25% Of the total fund. 
 We will arrange all the necessary procedures in ensuring a smooth 
process for the funds to get to you.We will also appreciate if you contact 
me once you receive this mail to enable me give you more details.This 
matter requires your urgent attention ,confidentiality and discretion no 
matter what your decision maybe. 
 Thank you and God bless you. 
 Your's Sincerely, 
 Duoala Mbale
