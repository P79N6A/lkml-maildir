Chris,
The compact flash probably doesn't like a MODE SENSE
command it is being sent by the sd driver. When sd is
a module then if your other (pseudo) terminals are alive
after 'modprobe sd_mod' locks up then perhaps you could
try 'ps -eo cmd,wchan' on another terminal and report
the result for that modprobe.
Some patches went into sd recently (and more are being discussed)
to lower the MODE SENSE traffic during sd initialization. There
is a very wide range of devices that use the scsi command set
and there is no easy way to know during scan/initialization
how well a device will handle some commands (scsi_level ??).
Another thing you could do is fetch sg3_utils from
http://www.torque.net/sg
 and report the result of
'sg_modes -a /dev/sg1'. That will report the MODE SENSE
commands the device claims to support. [BTW Run 'sg_modes'
before you try to 'modprobe sd_mod'.]
