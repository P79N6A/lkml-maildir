The results of hdparm are often a bit misleading. I've got two IDE disks
hooked up in a RAID0 (striping) configuration. hdparm reports 14 mb/sec
for the separate disks, but 2.6 mb/sec for the RAID array. When I test
it by writing and reading a few 1 gb datafiles, the speed is about 21
mb/sec. Quite a difference, 2.6 or 21 mb/sec...
Btw. when I tested these disks (Maxtor 8.4 DiamondMax) seperately with
some large files, they had an avarage transferrate of about 11 mb/sec,
not 14 mb/sec.
