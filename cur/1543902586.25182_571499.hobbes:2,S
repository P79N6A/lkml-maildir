This was already discussed and resolved during previous postings of the 
patch.
In a nutshell, there is no safe way to unload an LSM.  The modular 
interface is thus unecessary and broken infrastructure.  It is used only

the API and dangerous, e.g. silently re-vectoring SELinux.
Chris has already agreed to take the patch:
