Incorrect. Alphas have write buffers - 6x32 bytes on ev5 and
4x64 on ev6, IIRC. So alphas do write up to 32 or 64 bytes
in a single pci transaction.

You don't need memory barrier for that. "Write memory barriers" are
used to ensure correct write order, and "memory barriers" are used
to ensure that all pending reads/writes will complete before next read
or write.
