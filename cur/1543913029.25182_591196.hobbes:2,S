That may actually be a toolchain/build system problem. It's a i486 chroot in
which the compile happens. Host is x86_64 though as reported by uname. And I
use gcc 4.0 as HOSTCC, while CC is gcc 4.1.2.
# gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i486-linux-gnu
Configured with: ../src/configure -v 
--enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,objc,obj-c++,treelang --prefix=/usr 
--enable-shared --with-system-zlib --libexecdir=/usr/lib 
--without-included-gettext --enable-threads=posix --enable-nls 
--program-suffix=-4.1 --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-clocale=gnu 
--enable-libstdcxx-debug --enable-mpfr --with-tune=i686 
--enable-checking=release i486-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)
# uname -m
x86_64
