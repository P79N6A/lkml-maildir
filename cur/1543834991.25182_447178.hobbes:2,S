35.5 as I'm testing it here on my workstation and it seems to be
faster when you test some things involving many copies of large
multi-level sourcetree directories each 3 to 6GiB big in size.
2.6.18-rc2-mm1 with Reiser4 looks ok so far and I had no sync() OOPS
like the last time with one -mm revision.
speed tells us nothing about reliability of course, but compared to
ext3 with dir_index,sparse_super Reiser4 seems to handle "du -sh" and
"rm -r" much faster and without eating all of the CPU cycles as it
finishes quicker although Reiser4 was meant to be CPU-heavy compared
to ext*/reiserfs3.
