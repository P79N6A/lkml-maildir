Agreed.

Sounds reasonable to me.  Relieve the modules of having to
format their /proc entries by defining standard code that does
it.   And as an extra bonus, if tuples registration was table-driven,
the tables would define a grammar that could be fed to a parser
generator.
(It sounds a little bit like the snmpd code I'm working on,
actually.  How eerie.)
(It also sounds a little like (gasp) the windows registry,
but hey, that's ok.)
