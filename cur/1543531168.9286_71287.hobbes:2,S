I agree that you found a bug, I disagree that you will ever get 100% timing
correctness from Linux except at the cost of making the kernel unmaintainable.
Furthermore, if you do similar timing tests on VxWorks, Win-CE, and etc,  I bet
you will find that 100 milliseconds is not impossible. 
Note that even QNX quotes "typical" interrupt latency times.
