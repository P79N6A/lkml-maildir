I guess i was really just looking for a good example illustrating that a single
network card can be a good fast cheap way of sourcing data as compared to a
single ide or scsi controller.
I appreciate its the pci bus thats the ultimate limit.  You could have multiple
network devices using channel bonding to max out the pci bus, in the same way
as having multiple scsi controllers
I think the main purpose of distibuted filesystems is making better use of
existing technology rather than creating one superdooper machine.
As far as expense goes, scsi is about 50% more expensive than ide technology.
In reality distributed filesystems can be really cheap if implemented ontop of
existing infrastructure, say you have a lan of 20 existing desktop pc's that
came with 6GB drives if you spare a gig or so from each drive, then the only
expense is getting better network technolgy cards and a switched hub.
