Roland, I submitted an updated patch incorporating some of Sean's comments within
a day or two. Rest of comments pertained to restructuring the code and adding 
some additional module parameters.
This would require more discussions since some of these had been already discussed
previously. We had decided upon this code structure after a lot of discussions and
incorporating these would be undoing some of that.
We can discuss and revisit the comments after the merge.
