Here are some tests:
Before the tests, I do:
`ifconfig eth0 down`
`kill -TERM -1`
Then I disconnect my ethernet cable to get rid of those interrupts.
This is the test-script:
make clean
time make -j 10 bzImage
It is executed as `sh test.sh &>World.Log &` .
This is Linux 2.4.0-test9
This is a kernel build with NMI watchdog turned OFF:
349.04user 19.83system 3:21.96elapsed 182%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps
This is a kernel build with NMI watchdog turned ON:
348.23user 18.84system 3:57.14elapsed 154%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps
The elapsed time went from 3:21 to 3:57.
This is Linux 2.2.17
This is the kernel build (the exact same build as above).
214.91user 12.93system 2:37.00elapsed 145%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps
The original elapsed time when booting 2.2.17 was 2:37. It is now 3:57.
This is, in every case, rebuilding the exact same kernel.
It doth appearith asthough ithsucks.
Cheers,
