I agree, the Hammer is going to be interesting. But one of the most
interesting things to do will be to see if using it as a per-CPU memory
NUMA machine is slower or faster than using it with the memory interleaved
across CPU's (in which case it won't look NUMA at all).
My personal guess (assuming hypertransport works well) is that you'd
actually en dup interleaving at least for dual setups, and quite possibly
for quads as well. The per-node non-interleaved setup probably makes for
best _aggregate_ memory throughput if you have a load that has very
NUMA-friendly behaviour, but interleaving should make for best sustained
throughput for not-very-balanced-loads.

Yeah, looking good..
