The structure length does *not* include the string data, so we could pass the length test and still run of the table in dmi_string. What's more, the string index could be more that the string count for this structure and no check is done for this.

Then, the other checks (white space and null byte) will be obsolete.
Our console doesn't handle arbitary 8bit encodings. There are japanese
DMI strings out there for example
