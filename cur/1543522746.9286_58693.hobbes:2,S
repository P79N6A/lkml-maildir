        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  98168832 95830016  2338816 14954496 28844032 37449728
Swap: 115077120 18284544 96792576
Another oddity is that I'm using the EXACT same apps now as I did
a year ago, and a year ago I had 64M of RAM, and around 70M of
swap and it would barely ever go into swap at all for any reason
(2.2.[0-5])..  Now I have 96Mb RAM and 115Mb swap and it is in
swap quite a bit, but not usually more than 20Mb or so.
The only processes using significant memory right now are:
