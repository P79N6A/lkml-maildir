Yup - and then you hit the "trade secrets" problem.

I believe the collating sequence/filenames is documentd. What isn't documented
is how the journal file is handled. How recovery is handled.
I think trying to make that compatable hits the trade secrets. Compatability
is needed if you expect to take a partition from one OS to another and still
have the possible crash conditions handled. NTFS write was (briefly) available
until the lawyers came to the door. Along with an external tool to recover
NTFS file systems.
