hmm, with 4 million pages on the inactive list that's 1000 pages.  It might
be OK.
Bear in mind that under usual circumstances the direct-reclaim path will
refuse to block on request queue exhaustion so we might end up just
scanning past some dirty pages without starting I/O against them at all. 
End result: some jumbling up of the LRU order.  I suspect that's a
second-order problem though.  But hey, if we have a testcase, we can fix it!
