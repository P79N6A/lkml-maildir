First I would like to state that the TCP_KICK patch was only meant as a 
bandaid (copied from KA9q), not a well designed solution for anything.
Sometimes it is useful though.

2.3 has a kind of that already: the NET_XMIT_DROP, NET_XMIT_CN etc.
return flags defined for hard_xmit. They are not yet used by TCP though,
although some experiments were tried. 
2.0 does one optimization for modem type connections that 2.2+ has lost.
Because of the way the retransmit queue was handled by IP TCP never queued
a packet twice into a device queue on retransmit. It seems to help often.
It was planned to use the flags for similar optimization.
Currently it is a bit too late though for such things for 2.4.
