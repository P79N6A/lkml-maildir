It seems to be the output of vmstat that isn't matching things.  First it
says
it's getting near 10M/s, but if you divide 128M/27 seconds, it's more like
4.7.
So where is the time being wasted?  It's not in cpu either.
Now lets look at hda7 where vmstat reported 2-3meg/sec.  Again, the math
says it's a rate near 5.  So it still doesn't make sense.
