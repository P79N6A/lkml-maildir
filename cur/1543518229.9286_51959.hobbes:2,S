I think there is no good reason why settimeofday *should* update the
RTC. This is not desired in all cases and changing an existing system
call might cause problems with software expecting the old semantics.

If this functionality is really needed, it seems to me that it would
be a cleaner (and easy to implement) solution to put it in the user
level program used to change the date, not in the kernel.
