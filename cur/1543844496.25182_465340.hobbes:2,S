Sorry, I've been putting efforts to meet the deadline of the google
SoC project "Rapid linux desktop startup through pre-caching", which
still can not be called success for now. And there's my pending paper
work...
I should be able to come back and concentrate on the readahead patch
after one month, whether it be dropped for now.  I guess it can be
further improved in complexity and performance.  It also needs a good
document for the overall design and benefits.  And sure the
performance numbers :-)
