Hello!

Well, they seem to have no idea what's wrong. One guy at rtlinux mailing list 
had success building rtlinux-3.2-pre3 with 2.4.20 kernel on dual 2.4GHz Xeon 
machine. I have the same rtlinux-3.2-pre3 with 2.4.20 kernel on dual 2.4GHz 
Xeon machine, but rtlinux hangs it when I start it. That guy gave me his 
config but I didn't have any success anyway.
However, I have built the same 2.4.20/3.2-pre3 on PIII boxes and rtlinux runs 
perfectly.

No issues. 
I just know that Intel Xeon and Intel Pentium 4 Xeon are different things, 
that's why I was asking - there is only a "Pentium 4" option in kernel 
config.
Thanks for reply.
Artemio.
