Problem is that one gets tons of errors due to the use of the wrong

The exact way for doing it right is actually:
	depmod -ae $(KERNELRELEASE) -F $(LS)/System.map

It is not in the kernel, it is in my /lib/modules as it was built
originally.
I want to keep it there while I play with the new module, and not lose
the
original. Naturally, just my preference, not everybodies.
