Benno,
Having looked at the RT-Linux documentation, my impression was that
its task programming environment was even more restrictive than that
for regular device drivers.  That doesn't sound like a platform that
will produce interesting audio applications.
My current understanding is that acheiving our audio latency goals
depends on two things at the moment:
1) Less locking in the kernel.  I understand that this is slowly
coming about, but I'd like to be able to better track what can be
expected when.  Measuring where things are *now* is aided by programs
such as your latencytest.
2) HZ > 100.  This is so we can have something other than monolithic
programs that open and get their timing from the soundcard.
Apparently, this is easy to do now, but I wonder when it will
mainstream and be available in some distributions.
Best of Real-Time,
Eric
