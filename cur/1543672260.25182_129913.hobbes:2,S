Use mmap to make the kmalloc-ed buffer available to user
application without the overhead of memcpy().
It is very wonderful that you can do s/g, so on the next stage
you can kmalloc a bunch of blocks with small order (1) and use
those instead of relying on bootmem allocation and Pauline's
bigphysarea patch. Most older controllers cannot do it.
