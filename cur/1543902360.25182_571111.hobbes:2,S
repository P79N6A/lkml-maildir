If you're interested in doing more work, it would be nice to
generalize the seq-file functions for unicast and multicast
address lists and add /proc/net/dev_unicast or something like
that.
OTOH we could also export this using rtnetlink. The main reason
why I didn't do that is that it can only be read, not changed,
but this is also true for statistics etc. Any opinions on this?
