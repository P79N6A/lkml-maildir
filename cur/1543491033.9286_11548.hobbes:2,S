I have experienced problems with terminations of TCP-sockets. 
1) My side is actively sending a large amount of data to a rather 
   slow peer.
2) The peer suddenly dies. 
3) The socket-state becomes CLOSE_WAIT, and will stay so until the 
   sending process is killed. 
4) If the sending process is killed, the socket-state will turn into 
   LAST_ACK, and will stay so "forever". 
5) This "forever", might sometimes only last for a few weeks or months.
I run kernel v2.0.36. 
Any ideas about this problem?  Or any suggestion how I could try to 
locate the error in the kernel? 
At present I do have two sockets hanging as described, one in CLOSE_WAIT 
with an attached process, and another in LAST_ACK without any process.
