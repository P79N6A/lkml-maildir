It looks like the linux wants the NT server to authenticate with
chap-md5, which NT refuses with the ConfRej.
I dont think NT supports chap-md5 (only chap-m$oft).
NT requests linux to authenticate with chap-m$soft and linux
accepts, so chap-m$soft support is there.
You need to get pppd to either authenticate the peer (NT) with
chap-m$soft (I'm not sure how, look at the docs) or disable
authentication of the peer (noauth option).
