Subject: [PATCH 15/28] driver core: Don't stop probing on ->probe errors.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/7/314

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>
Don't stop on the first ->probe error that is not -ENODEV/-ENXIO.
There might be a driver registered returning an unresonable return code, and
this stops probing completely even though it may make sense to try the next
possible driver. At worst, we may end up with an unbound device.
