of which kernel ?
I am not at home .. 
but I have here /proc/interrupts from one 2.6.16 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=7927&action=view
from my bug 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419
Tonight I can attach on bugzilla bug#6419, /proc/interrupts from one
kernel 2.6.18 and from one kernel 2.6.19-rc4 
BTW: those kernels are for x86_64 arch, I haven't try, yet, i386, but
maybe will be my next test. 
Thanks,
