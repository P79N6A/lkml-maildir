So what? You don't change it on *MY* machine, now do you? *MY* version 
remains stable regardless of what *YOU* do unless I update my source 
code.

No, it is not the same version. One is the UNI version and one is the SMP 
version. By version of kernel I mean the version of the binary that I am 
building the loadable module to work with. You can just consider the 
UNI/SMP support to be an extension of the version and treat them as 
different versions (after all, you will need two separate modules to 
handle this anyway).
