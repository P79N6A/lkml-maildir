Hello,
making proxy arp entries for entire subnets doesn't work with 2.2.0-pre1.
I use that feature regularly with 2.0.
The net-tools-1.49 arp doesn't display any error message, but the entry
is not created.
A quick look at arp_req_set() in net/ipv4/arp.c:
---
if (r->arp_flags&ATF_PUBL) {
	u32 mask = ((struct sockaddr_in *) &r->arp_netmask)->sin_addr.s_addr;
	if (mask && mask != 0xFFFFFFFF)
		return -EINVAL;
---
Ok, it seems that support has been dropped.
Question: WHY ???
