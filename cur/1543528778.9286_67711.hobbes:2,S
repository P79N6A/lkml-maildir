serial.c does that.

Yes that's what I was thinking.  ppp_async.c does some complicated
looking stuff in write_wakeup...  including a kfree_skb().  That would
explain the message.  That could just be changed to kfree_skb_any().
I really don't know if the rest of ppp_async_wakeup is irq safe, but it
does like it _might_ be.
