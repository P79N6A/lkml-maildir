Another solution is to avoid the per-cpu caches.  Yes - one big cache
for all processors.  I believe this is hard to achieve on a circuit
board,
those low-latency caches need impressive signalling speed incompatible
with ten-centimeter distances.    But it may be a good solution
for a dual/quad-on-a-chip cpu.
