My use for it was in a high availability cluster, where I was using NBD to
set up shared storage between the two machines.
Another challenge I ran into, which DRBD solves well, is that it was hard
to get the RAID to operate in degraded mode.  It would try to access the
block device on the first startup of the md device after the primary
failure, even if the raidtab told it the drive was dead...  I finally just
set up a noop nbd server that would return the proper size on startup, but
any subsequent read/writes would fail...

Updates to the Configuration documentation would really help.  I've asked
google to index nbd.sf.net, and also asked Alan Robertson to add it to his
list of shared storage alternatives on the linux-ha.com site.  When I was
trying to get NBD going, I was unable to find nbd.sf.net through google,
though this may have changed in month since I was doing the work...
