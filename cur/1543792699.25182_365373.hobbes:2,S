Sigh, That's funny - I've written C++ code which has references as members
of objects.  You absolutely *can* store a reference.
References are simply a syntactic simplification to eliminate the
different pointer-dereference notation.  If they make you think about a
problem differently, that's fine, but they are really just pointers in
disguise.
