Ah, I see. This is the only piece I didn't double-check against the
2.6.8.1 sources (I found the problem originally in the SuSE 2.6.5
derivate, where the kernel.org version didn't have swsusp_pg_dir at all,
yet), and indeed in the kernel.org version swsusp_pg_dir lives in
arch/i386/mm/init.c (one might argue which of the placements is the
better one).
Still, to prevent issues in the future as well as such like seen with
SuSE, the patch seems necessary to me.
Thanks, Jan
