Subject: [PATCH 22/29] x86-crash_shutdown-nmi-shootdown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/19/73

One of the dangers when switching from one kernel to another
is what happens to all of the other cpus that were running
in the crashed kernel.   In an attempt to avoid that problem
this patch adds a nmi handler and attempts to shoot down
the other cpus by sending them non maskable interrupts.
The code then waits for 1 second or until all known cpus
have stopped running and then jumps from the running kernel
that has crashed to the kernel in reserved memory.
The kernel spin loop is used for the delay as that should
behave continue to be safe even in after a crash.
