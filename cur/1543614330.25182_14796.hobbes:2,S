Run a "RT"  task that is scheduled   every millisecond (or time of your
choice)
	while(1`){
		read cycle timer
		clock_nanosleep(time period using aabsolute time
		read cycle timer - what was actual delay? track worst
			case
		}
Run this 
	a) on aaaaaaaaan unstressed system
	b) under stress
	c) while a timed non-rt benchmark runs to figure out "RT" 
	overhead.
