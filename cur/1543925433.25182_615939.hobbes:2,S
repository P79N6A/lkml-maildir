Indeed, that's what I was intending on keeping around as a convention,
and simply overloading SRCARCH for the sh64 case. i386/x86_64 potentially
has the same issue though, and if the intent is to have a single ARCH for
both of them, I don't see how that would possibly work without
sacrificing randconfig.. unless the intended x86 convention is that one
compiler will happily handle both i386 and x86_64 without any difficulty?
The idea of a single SRCARCH and differing ARCHs for adjusting the build
semantics as we have now is quite straightforward and seems clean enough
without pushing for ARCH unification.
