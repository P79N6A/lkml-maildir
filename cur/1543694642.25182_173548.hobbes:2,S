I've been playing with kernel-2.6 on redhat's latest beta. With my
radeon 7500 drm works great. When I boot to kernel-2.6 latest, I
modprobe agpgart, intel-agp and radeon. Startx and run glxinfo
and glxgears and both segfault. Anyone else seeing this? This
also happens if these are build statically.
