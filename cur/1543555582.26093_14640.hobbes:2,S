Sure it does. The isofs code contains exctly that:
	block = filp->f_pos >> bufbits;
In fact, almost all filesystems do this at some point. ext2 does it for
directories too, for some very similar reasons that isofs does. See
fs/ext2/dir.c:
	blk = (filp->f_pos) >> EXT2_BLOCK_SIZE_BITS(sb);
(and don't ask me about the extraneous parenthesis. I bet some LISP
programmer felt alone and decided to make it a bit more homey).
