I have similar problems with two DEC Tulip cards running at 100 mbit
full-dupex. I'm currently using the de4x5 driver and when one of my
machines needs to reboot, the other switches to 10 mbit. When the
other machines comes back up again, it does switch backup to 100 mbit,
but the connection is completely screwed up (I've seen pingtimes of up
to 6000 sec!) Both machines start issuing ARP request for each other,
but get no reply. I've had this both with 2.0 and 2.2 kernels, so I'm
guessing it's not a kernel issue. It is very annoying though. I should
probably force both cards to one medium...
