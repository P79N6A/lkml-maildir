That seems reasonable, but I don't think there necessarily be enough
cpuset users to make this reasonable as the only interface.
Seems like something VMA-based along the lines of madvise() or the NUMA
binding API would be more appropriate.  Perhaps default policies
inherited from a cpuset, but overridden by other APIs would be a good
compromise.
I have the feeling that applications will want to give the same kind of
notifications for swapping as they would for memory hotplug operations
as well.  In decreasing order of pickiness:
1. Don't touch me at all
2. It's OK to migrate these pages elsewhere on this node
3. It's OK to migrate these pages anywhere
4. It's OK to swap these pages out
Although the node part, at least, can almost certainly be done in
combination with the NUMA api.
