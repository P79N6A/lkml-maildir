Fnord alert: you're trying to change the API and the ABI of Linux. The thing
you fail to see is that Linux is not the only operating system in the world. 
Big companies are very prone of using their compatibility code to make their
program run in any odd way they like without actually having to change
anything. Also, you're talking about assumptions that have been true for
decades.
Big companies are already eyeing Linux with fear because our kernels don't
actually work and because we break a lot of compatibility in the stable
series. If you now come up with something that breaks basically everything
so they need a new libc and everything, it's rather likely that they'll run
away.
I just want you to consider that. Linux needs to get to a stable state of
affairs at some time.
