        Then why complain about it? Don't buy NVidia cards! if you don't like 
what they're doing with the code and the drivers, don't buy or use their 
product. Simple as that. There's always ATI, SiS, and many other cards with 
fully GPL coded drivers for it. Just because one may think that NVidia is the 
best card out on the market, doesn't mean (unfortunately) they have to 
accomodate every OS that uses it, and do it the same way that every other 
company does. You have a choice, but also, so do they.
        I have an SiS 315E card in my box, and it works great, and haven't 
looked at any other card since installing it.
