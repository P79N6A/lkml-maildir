Given the ACP_IBM_BAY implementation is more complete (or seems to be,
please comment if that isn't the case) we should probably actually
make sure that is the *preferred* code used (on suitable hardware) at
run time surely?
That way distributions can build both options and on IBM/Lenovo
hardware it will use the IBM ACPI code and otherwise will use the
generic ACPI BAY code?
Perhaps the IBM_ACPI_BAY code should go away and any missing
functionality provided there should be merged into ACPI_BAY?
