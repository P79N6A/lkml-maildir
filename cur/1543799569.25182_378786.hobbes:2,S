The thing here is that the GPL discusses distributing.  If I were to
receive a binary kernel, that happens to have implemented the same API as
Linux, is it a violation of the GPL.  As long as it doesn't use any of the
same code and does a "clean room" kind of implementation of the API it is
perfectly legal.
So now if I have this binary kernel, and I myself compile a GPL module, I
don't see anything in the GPL that would prevent me from linking it in.
This is where it gets to be a problem with binary modules.  They only
implement up to the API (granted, it shouldn't include code in the
headers), but it's the user that's linking and not the distributor.  That
is where the gray area lies.
