> Are those 80-ribbon cables by themselves marked/keyed in any way?
Yes -- as I understand it, a wire is cut.
This is why ATA-66 cables are `directional' if the middle connector is used.
(many have blue for the Motherboard, grey in the midle, and black at the end).
See 
http://www.quantum.com/src/whitepapers/wp_ultraata66.htm
  This detection is achieved by having a break in one of the lines on the
  80-conductor cable that is normally an unbroken connection in the existing
  cable. It is this break that is detected and the system BIOS can instruct
  the drive to run at the correct speed for the cable type detected.
