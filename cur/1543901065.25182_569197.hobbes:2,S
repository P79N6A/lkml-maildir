Subject: [PATCH 0/3] libata: add taskfile protocol ->proto_mask info member
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches add proto_mask alongside pio_mask, mwdma_mask, and
udma_mask.  This is a more uniform way to export which features host
controllers support (DMA? NCQ? ATAPI? ATAPI DMA?), rather than creating
a new ATA_FLAG_xxx for each.
This also opens the door to useful things like combining "if
protocol==foo || protocol==bar" tests into a single mask, or masking
between host and device to determine common protocols.
Suggestions for improvement welcome, this is just the first cut.  Stored
on libata-dev.git#pmask for now.
