I just could build and boot a stock 2.3.26-kernel with a minor patch.
The default config was pmac_config with the ramdisk support disabled.
The system comes up and top or free reports 2GB of ram (real 96MB) as
since 2.3.24. In dmesg the memory is detected correct.
The machine is a Wallstreet I 250MHz.
The change I had to do: O_LARGEFILE was not defined, so I did this like
in asm-i386/fcntl. Is this correct? It works so far.
