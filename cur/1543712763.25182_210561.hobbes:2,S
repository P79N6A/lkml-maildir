Subject: [sched patch] more sync wakeups, 2.6.5-rc3-mm1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/30/240

the attached patch extends sync wakeups to the process sys_exit() path
too: the chldwait wakeup can be done sync, since we know that the
process is going to exit (and thus deschedule).
the most visible effect of this change is strace's behavior on SMP
systems: it now stays on a single CPU, together with the traced child. 
(previously it would run in parallel to the child, bouncing around
madly.)
compiled & tested.
