I could use a little help here interpreting this.  I'm trying to track
down the cause of an Oops that occurs on a system I don't have
direct access to.  It appears from the EIP that the kernel is dying
far outside of the kernel proper, as the _end symbol in the
system.map has the value c02a5a78. 
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer deference at virtual address 00000080
Current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00000000

Now according to the call trace, the last call from within the kernel
was at c01733c7, which appears to be the following instruction in
p8022_rcv:
0xc014c76e <p8022_rcv+74>:      call   *%eax
(The address is different because I'm running gdb against a kernel that
I do have access to, same version.)  I note above that eax is zeroes.
Now for my questions:
o  Is the call trace and EIP correct and the kernel died in parts
   unknown (and if so, how did it get there), or
o  Is the last entry in the call trace and the EIP incorrect and we
   just tried calling a nonexistant function at 0x0000000?
