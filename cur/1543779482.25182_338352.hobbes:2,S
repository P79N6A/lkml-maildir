Heh. I just checked. We still do exactly that:
                        if (!(file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE))
                                vm_flags &= ~(VM_MAYWRITE | VM_SHARED);
some code never dies ;)
However, we still set the VM_MAYSHARE bit, and thats' the one that
mm/rmap.c checks for some reason. I don't see quite why - VM_MAYSHARE
doesn't actually ever do anything else than make sure that we try to
allocate a mremap() mapping in a cache-coherent space, I think (ie it's a
total no-op on any sane architecture, and as far as rmap is concerned on
all of them).
