too bad, I was thinking that a driver in a low-power state could be 
initialized normally and we could avoid having different quiesce and 
low-power states

this makes sense.

for now allow this option as it's the simplest to implement (it takes 
extra work to re-use the kernel)
also, the objections to the auto-config kernel requests have mostly been 
how it's impossible for the auto-config to get enough things right. in the 
case of a hibernate kernel I think it's such a minimal config that it 
should be possible to have an auto-config script that you tell 'I plan to 
suspend to partition X, give me a minimal kernel that can access ram, that 
partition, and the framebuffer (for status output)' and have it produce a 
tiny kernel with only thta support

on the other hand, booting a standard distro kernel that does hotplug 
detection for everything it can find on the system is far from optimal as 
well.
