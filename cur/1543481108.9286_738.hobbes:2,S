so the problem is just only the ~O(n) search in the buffer cache right?

No this is a workaround of the problem I think that right now I should
enlarge the buffer hash table of the buffer headers for high memory
machines.
Really I think that for the long run I should start dropping the cache and
buffer hashes replacing them with RB-trees to work fine everywhere without
waste some base memory with fuzzy hash tables. I think that doing that
everything should scale _far_ better also under the scenario you are
describing.
Comments from David? (note RB-trees != AVL ;).
