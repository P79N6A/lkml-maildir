Hi,
when compiling the latest 2.6 tree from the Bitkeeper repository, I get
a lot of these:
  CC      init/main.o
In file included from include/linux/fs.h:202,
                 from include/linux/proc_fs.h:6,
                 from init/main.c:17:
include/linux/limits.h:4:1: warning: "NR_OPEN" redefined
In file included from include/linux/proc_fs.h:6,
                 from init/main.c:17:
include/linux/fs.h:24:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
Maybe the re-order of <linux/fs.h> to make userland happy was not a good
idea.
Regards
Marcel
