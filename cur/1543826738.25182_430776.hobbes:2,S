Hmm.  That ones seems to be restricted for some reason.  I think that
this happens when we get escalated bugzillas from customers.

The server side patch isn't quite sufficient on its own.  A RHEL-4 patch
is also required for the client side.  I could construct the RHEL-4 patch
so that it alone would be sufficient to address the particular problem
that that customer is having, but that isn't the entire situation.
Non-Linux clients would still have a problem with the current upstream
Linux server.  For example, in my testing, a Solaris 10 client mounting
an FC-5 server fails.  When running the attached script, the mtime on
the file, bar, should change by about 1 minute, 3 times.
    Thanx...
