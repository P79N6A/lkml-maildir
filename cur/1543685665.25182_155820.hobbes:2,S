Right! I fully agree that having 2 names for the same type is bad,
although "find -type f | grep flavou?r" would be a quite adequate way
of matching both spellings.
The point is, though, that I could have written
rpc_authflavor_t f;
and nobody would have cared or complained about grepability.
Anybody who claims that they have problems reading the code due to the
difference between US and British spelling of the same variable is in
reality engaged in a completely different type of crusade. One that
doesn't deserve attention...
Cheers,
