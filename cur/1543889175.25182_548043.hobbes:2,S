Eh...  Arbitrary limitations are fun, aren't they?

What about clone copying your namespace?  What about MNT_SLAVE stuff being
set up prior to that lookup?  More interesting question: should independent
lookups of that sucker on different paths end up with the same superblock
(and vfsmount for each) or should we get fully independent mount on each?
The latter would be interesting wrt cache coherency...

Arbitrary limitations... (and that's where revalidate horrors come in, BTW).
BTW^2: what if fs mounted that way will happen to have such node itself?
I'm not saying that it's unfeasible or won't lead to interesting things,
but it really needs semantics done right...
