Subject: [PATCH 2/2] cpu hotplug: fix ksoftirqd termination on cpu hotplug with naughty realtime process
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix ksoftirqd termination on cpu hotplug with naughty real time process.
Assuming the following case:
 - Try to hot remove CPU2 from CPU1.
 - There is a real time process on CPU2, and that process doesn't sleep at all.
 - That rt process and ksoftirqd/2 is migrated to the CPU0
Then ksoftirqd/2 can't stop becasue that rt process runs everlastingly on CPU0,
and CPU1 waiting the ksoftirqd/2's termination hangs up. To fix this problem, set
the priority of ksoftirqd/2 to max one before kthread_stop().
