FUSD's user-kernel interface won't change spuriously, but it sometimes
will need to change as features are added.  Some such changes are
already in the works.
The fact that FUSD provides a semi-stable binary interface for servicing
device-file callbacks isn't really FUSD's design goal as much as it is an
accidental side effect.  Making a stable binary interface for kernel
device drivers is the objective of, say, UDI (I think).  The purpose of
FUSD is just to be able to proxy the callbacks to userspace.
Best,
Jer
