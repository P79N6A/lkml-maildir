Note that you can only reach it if you have a *compile-time constant* of
over 32M or so in size.  If it's smaller, it will catch the appropriate
if/then from kmalloc_sizes.h (and all the others removed by the optimizer).
And since there *isn't* a definition, you'll get a complaint when you
try to link vmlinux - and the complaint will tell you where it's referenced.
