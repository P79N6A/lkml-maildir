Subject: [PATCH] clocksource: Fix thinko in watchdog selection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/25/81

The watchdog implementation excludes low res / non continuous
clocksources from being selected as a watchdog reference
unintentionally.
Allow using jiffies/PIT as a watchdog reference as long as no better
clocksource is available. This is necessary to detect TSC breakage on
systems, which have no pmtimer/hpet.
The main goal of the initial patch (preventing to switch to highres/nohz
when no reliable fallback clocksource is available) is still guaranteed
by the checks in clocksource_watchdog().
