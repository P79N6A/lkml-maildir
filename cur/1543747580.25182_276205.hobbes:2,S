I don't know what happens with the 4 client case, but it's not that
unlikely that aggregate bandwidth will be higher for more threads doing
random writes, as request coalesching will help minimize seeks.
But I did think it was strange with the 4 client case dip was strange,
it was reproducable though (as are all the results, they have very
little variance).
