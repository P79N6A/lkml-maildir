Maybe in sparsemem code, we could mark a well chosen page as reserved if
the size of mem region is < MAX_ORDER. That way the buddy allocator
will never have to free a block of 128 KO...

wouldn't it be safer to mark these pages as "invalid" instead of "reserved"
with a special value stored in mem_map[] ?

thanks for that.

here is a updated version of my mapping, it should be clear now:
HOLE0: 0 - 3 Go
MEM1: 0xc000 0000 - 32 Mo
HOLE1: 0xc200 0000 - 224 Mo
MEM2: 0xd000 0000 - 8 Mo
HOLE2: 0xd080 0000 - 120 Mo
MEM3: 0xd800 0000 - 128 Ko
HOLE3: rest of mem
