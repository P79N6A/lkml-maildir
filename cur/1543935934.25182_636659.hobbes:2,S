But your patch does:
+config PM_CPUINIT
+       bool
+       depends on PM
+       default y
As an example, even plain ACPI support without any suspend support in 
the kernel at all requires CONFIG_PM and therefore forces all __cpuinit 
code to be non-__init after your patch.
And if the dependency was corrected to PM_SLEEP it will still make 
the UP kernel use more memory since we currently have __cpuinit code 
that gets discarded after boot but suspend/resume is apparently working.
Plus my other point that it seems to be wrong to do whatever change only 
for x86.
