So it happens every two/three weeks. I have to reboot to get the ADSL line 
back up.

Not here. This is an essentially idle mail server, using ADSL as backup net 
connection.

I guess people running desktops rarely notice the problem, since they are 
likely to power cycle more frequently than the error occurs. For long lived 
servers, its quite a nuisance.
Let me know if I can do anything to help track this down. I'm happy to run an 
instrumented kernel if that would help.
