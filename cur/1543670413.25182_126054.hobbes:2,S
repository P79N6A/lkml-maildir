It can be installed such that it calls the old versions, renamed to
xxx-old, if used from a 2.4 system. However, I don't think Redhat did that
type install for 9.0, so it will probably not work after an upgrade.
The last I looked modprobe.conf was a seriously deficient subset of
modules.conf, but I haven't d/l the latest version, so some of the
omissions may have been addressed. The major feature missing is (or was)
the lack of probe capability (and probeall). You can run a dual system,
but you do have to work at it a little bit.
