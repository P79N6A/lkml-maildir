Hello All,
I am having trouble getting decent PCI throughput on either of my AMD
system (both using the AMD 760 chipset.)  I am moving a high definition
frame into a pci frame buffer.  This process takes somewhere around 100
ms on my Dual Xeon system, however on the two AMD systems I have tried
it is taking about 1 sec (1000 ms).
The two systems I have tried are a single processor athlon system and a
dual processor athlon system.  (Both use the AMD chipset .. the single
uses the AMD760 and the dual uses the AMD760MP).  Both boxes are running
kernel 2.4.6.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Jason
