how do you handle swapoff and mlock then? anonymous memory is pinned w/o
swap. You've relocate the stuff during the mlock or swapoff to obey to
the pin limits to make this work right, and it sounds quite complicated
and it would hurt mlock performance a lot too (some big app uses mlock
to pagein w/o page faults tons of stuff).
Note that the "pinned" thing in theory makes *perfect* sense, but it
only makes sense on _top_ of lowmem_zone_reserve_ratio, it's not an
alternative.
When the page is pinned you obey to the "lowmem_zone_reserve_ratio" when
it's _not_ pinned then you absolutely ignore the
lowmem_zone_reseve_ratio and you go with the watermarks[curr_zone_idx]
instead of the class_idx.
But in practice I doubt it worth it since I doubt you want to relocate
pagecache and anonymous memory during swapoff/mlock.
