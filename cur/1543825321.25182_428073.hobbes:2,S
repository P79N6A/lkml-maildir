But the driver does disable_irq(), so I'd say this was a false-positive.
And afaict this is not a timer handler - it's a poll_controller handler
(although maybe that get called from timer handler somewhere?)
That being said, doing disable_irq() from a poll_controller handler is
downright scary.
Anwyay, I'll tentatively mark this as a lockdep workaround, not a bugfix.
