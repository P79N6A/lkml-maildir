Ok, well, I'm still using the KS75A under Linux, Win98, and WinXP, and the
only OS that seems to have problems is Linux.  I don't have any data
corruption problems (as far as I know), but I'm still getting the DMA
timeout errors reported in the thread above.  There definitely seems to be
more reports than normal about IDE problems with Linux on this board.  And
other than IDE the board seems pretty stable.
Btw, the SIS900 is the on-board Ethernet controller.
Cheers,
Adrian
