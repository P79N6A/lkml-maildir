i noticed high stack-tracer overhead too. Which is understandable i guess: 
the stack tracer keeps the mcount callbacks running all the time and can 
save the stack backtrace of the highest-stack-usage point in time that the 
kernel ever has hit in the past. That is a pretty powerful debug 
capability, with appropriate costs.
