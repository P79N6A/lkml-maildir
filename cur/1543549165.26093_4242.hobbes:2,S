Yuri, I apologize for doubting you.  That's about the best evidence possible 
that the test8 ptrace fix is what's breaking UML and not the thread group 
stuff.
If anyone has any idea why that fix breaks PTRACE_SYSCALL, I'd love to know.  
I'm kind of short on time at the moment, so I'm not in a great position to 
delve into this at the moment.
Until this is fixed, UML doesn't work on any host kernels beyond test7.
