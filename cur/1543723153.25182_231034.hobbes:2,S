Hello Everyone,
I  have "general"  Linux  OS scheduling  questions, especially with regards
as those apply to the (latest) Linux  2.6  scheduler features (would really
appreciate if whether/when/while answering those questions listed  below,
you could pinpoint differences between Linux 2.6 and Linux 2.4 !): 
0.  I was told that the Linux kernel could be configured with one of the 3
(? ) different scheduling policies - could someone describe       
     those to me in details ?
1.   How rescheduling is "induced" in above scheduling policies ?
      Does at least one of above mentioned scheduling policies uses "clock
tick" as a scheduling event ?
     Also, releasing mutex lock (semaphore) in Linux application/user-space
task - is it considered (by the sched) as a
     "rescheduling event" ? - (in addition to "clock tick" event) - this is
true for PSOS / VxWorks RTOSes.
2.  Linux 2.6 (I was told it is the same for Linux 2.4.21-15) has priorities
0-99 for RT priorities and 100-139 for normal   (SCHED_NORMAL)   tasks.

Under what priority the OS system calls are executed ?
3.  Is  priority inversion and its prevention (priority inheritance or
priority ceilings) applicable to Linux ) for application/user-space tasks (
with priorities in the range 100-139) ?

> executes "OS system call" in the kernel address space ?
> Similar question for the RT tasks (which I presume are Linux kernel
> "native" tasks, always executing in the kernel address space ? ) ?

4. What about scheduling threads ? - as I have understood (from the FAQ on
http://www.tux.org/lkml/
 ), threads in Linux are implemented in the kernel
space - is this information up to date, i.e. - is it applicable to Linux 2.6
? and what it actually means 
(does it mean that threads are always running in the kernel space ? - that
sounds a bit strange ...).
With what  priorities threads are running ? - do those priorities depend on
the priority of the application/user space process from which the  clone
system call was made  ?). 
5. Deviating from the scheduling line of questions (but staying with threads
issues): is there an option in clone(2)  to make threads 
   not to run in the same  address space but rather act as independent
process(es).

scheduling
Alexander,
you might want to post your questions to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
(or some other, RT related mailing list). The scheduler is described in
a rudimentary way in Documentation/sched-design.txt, sched-coding.txt,
with no focus on RT though.
