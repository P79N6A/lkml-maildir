I would say the major difference is that ub implements a block device 
interface directly whereas usb-storage relies on the SCSI layer for that 
purpose.  (Not to mention that usb-storage works with devices that aren't 
of the direct-access type...)

I agree that the debug logging in usb-storage is not good.  A worthwhile
improvement would be to log only commands that fail or get an error, with
the logging selected by the normal USB debugging (not usb-storage verbose
debugging) configuration option.  Matt, what do you think?

It look like you are targeting ub for Linux 2.4.  Do you intend to use it 
with 2.6?  An important difference between the two kernel versions is that 
in 2.6 we do not try to make devices persistent across disconnections by 
recognizing some type of unique ID.
