Linus,
I booted without an initrd defined (still have support compiled in
though) and I didn't get an Oops when I booted. So I guess it's related
to initrd. Here's some more that I noticed..
--snip--
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).
kernel BUG at buffer.c:827!
.....Oops.....
Code: 0f 0b 83 c4 0c 8d 73 28 8d 43 2c 39 43 2c 74 15 b9 01 00 00 
hub.c: port 1 connection change
hub.c: port 1, portstatus 101, change 1, 12 Mb/s
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
change_root: old root has d_count=4
Trying to unmount old root ... <3>error -16
Change root to /initrd: error -2
--snip--
I noticed that there have been changes made to the initrd documention so
I'll look there to see if maybe the mkinitrd script on my system isn't
following something correctly. Unless of course you know of hand of
something else to look at.
