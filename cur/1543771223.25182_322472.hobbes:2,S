This probably explains your trouble. It makes no sense to allow
__run_timer to be preemptible without having the synchronous timer
delete primitives. Synchronisation is impossible without them.
Which version of the RT patches are you using? The one I'm looking at
(2.6.12-rc5-rt-V0.7.47-15) certainly defines both del_timer_sync() and
del_singleshot_timer_sync() to be the same as the SMP versions if you
are running an RT kernel with preemptible softirqs.
Cheers,
