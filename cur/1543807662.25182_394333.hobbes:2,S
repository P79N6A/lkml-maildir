Well, the two pieces come from different sources.

It makes sense, but I disagree.  I believe you are correct in that the 
current "preferred minor" bit causes an invalid assumption that, e.g. 
/dev/md3 is always a certain thing, but since each array has a UUID, and 
one should be able to mount by either filesystem UUID or array UUID, 
there should be no need for such a conflict if one allows for dynamic md 
numbers.
Requiring that mdadm.conf describes the actual state of all volumes 
would be an enormous step in the wrong direction.  Right now, the Linux 
md system can handle some very oddball hardware changes (such as on 
hera.kernel.org, when the disks not just completely changed names due to 
a controller change, but changed from hd* to sd*!)
Dynamicity is a good thing, although it needs to be harnessed.

This, in fact is *EXACTLY* what we're talking about; it does require 
autoassemble.  Why do we care about the partition types at all?  The 
reason is that since the md superblock is at the end, it doesn't get 
automatically wiped if the partition is used as a raw filesystem, and so 
it's important that there is a qualifier for it.
