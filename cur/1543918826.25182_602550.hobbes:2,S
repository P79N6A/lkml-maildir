No, doesn't work. I forgot that on that PC I can only boot with 
"acpi=noirq", so, the whole ACPI IRQ-mapping code is not used. Otherwise, 
I did build such a kernel for that PC - noticed no problem. So, either the 
only two "miscompiled" places were i2c-viapro and acpi irq routing, or 
indeed it only triggers problems on C7...
