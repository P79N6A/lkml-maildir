Hi Ingo,
Thanks for your reply.

Almost two weeks actually. Ok 1.8 :)

Ingo, I may have the wrong impression but my impression is that you ignored all the 
other emails and just read Linus' reply. I do not believe this accusation is valid.
I apologize if my impression is incorrect.
Since the patches _do not_ change/affect existing scheduler/cpuset functionality I did 
not know who to CC in the first email that I sent. Luckily Peter picked it up and CC'ed 
a bunch of folks, including Paul, Steven and You.
All of them replied and had questions/concerns. As I mentioned before I believe I addressed
all of them.

Ok. I did not realize I'm supposed to do that. 
Since I got no replies to the second round of patches (take 2), which again was CC'ed to
the same people that Peter CC'ed. I assumed that people are ok with it. That's what discussion 
on the first take ended with.

See above. 
Following issues were raised:
1. Peter and Steven initially thought that workqueue isolation is not needed.
2. Paul thought that it should be implemented on top of cpusets.
3. Peter thought that stopmachine change is not safe.
There were a couple of other minor misunderstandings (for example Peter thought 
that I'm completely disallowing IRQs on isolated CPUs, which is obviously not
the case). I clarified all of them.
#1 I explained in the original thread and then followed up with concrete code example
of why it is needed.

Got no replies so far. So I'm assuming folks are happy.
#2 I started a separate thread on that
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120180692331461&w=2
The conclusion was, well let me just quote exactly what Paul had said:

And #3 Peter did not agree with me but said that it's up to Linus or Andrew to decide
whether it's appropriate in mainline or not. I _clearly_ indicated that this part is
somewhat controversial and maybe dangerous, I'm _not_ trying to sneak something in. 
Andrew picked it up and I'm going to do some more investigation on whether it's really
not safe or is actually fine (about to send an email to Rusty).

That's exactly what Paul proposed initially. I completely disagree with that but I did look 
at it in _detail_. 
Please take a look here for detailed explanation

This email getting to long and I did not want to inline everything.

I believe it has _nothing_ to do with the "scheduler" but I do not mind it being in that tree.
Please read this email on why it has nothing to do with the scheduler
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120210515323578&w=2
That's the email that convinced Paul.
To sum it up. It has been discussed with the right people. I do not believe that pull
request was premature. In fact I think we're making a bigger deal out of these simple
changes than it should be. At the end of the day those features are disabled by default
and do _not_ affect _anything_. But like I said I'll play by the rules. So ...
Next step for me is to address Andrew's comments, I'll resent the patches with those.
And to follow up with Andrew and Rusty on the stopmachine thing.
Thanks for your reply.
