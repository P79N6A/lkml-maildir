   Why?
   By definition, nothing can be destroying caches at the moment because there
   is no way of doing it. So how does adding a function to do this require
   changes to all users?
And furthermore by definition, with my suggested scheme nobody will
_need_ to explicitly destroy a cache.  So my fix allowed everyone to
just work with the module unload/reload case with no changes to
anything outside of SLAB.
I thought I had made this explicit in my original email, perhaps not.
