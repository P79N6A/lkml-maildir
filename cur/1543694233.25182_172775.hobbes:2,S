Hello,
I am using a 2.4.22 kernel from www.kernel.org together with an XFS
patch from SGI. I want to use LVM for creating snapshots for backups,
but I found out that I cannot mount the snapshots of journalling
filesystems (EXT3, XFS, Reiser). Only JFS snapshots can be mounted.
My research on internet gave the result that a kernel-patch must be used
to solve that problem, but I could not find such a patch for Linux
2.4.22, so where can I get it?
Kind Regards
  Christoph 
PS: I do not know if it is of interest, but my distribution is Debian
woody with LVM 1.0.
