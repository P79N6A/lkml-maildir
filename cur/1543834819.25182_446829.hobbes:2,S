Correct. Heiko sets ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN which will be passed as the 
'align' parameter to kmem_cache_create -- also known as 'caller mandated 
alignment.'
My patch changes the code so that, if either architecture or 
caller mandated alignment is greater than BYTES_PER_WORD, 
kmem_cache_create will disable debugging. Do you now see why my patch is 
in fact _not_ ignoring ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN, but instead respecting that.
