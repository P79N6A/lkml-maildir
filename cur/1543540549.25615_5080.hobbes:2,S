Hi all,
the following happens here on two K6-(500|350) machines.
NFS Server: 2.2.15-6mdk
	K62-350, 64MB RAM, IDE UDMA33 with two IBM disks
	knfsd, version 1:0.1.9.1-1
NFS Client: 2.2.16-9mdk
	K62-500, 128MB RAM, SCSI (ncr53c8xx, Tekram DC-390F)
	nfs-utils-clients.rpm version 0.1.5
	
Copy files (on client) from NFS volume to local /tmp: about 3-3.5MB/s,
steady throughput (according to xosview).
Copy (on client) from local harddisk to remote dir: very shaky, 1sec
throughput and 2sec pause, avg. about 200-500k/sec. This happens also when
I replace the network card in the client (with a RTL 8139).  
Another issue is that whenever I unplug the tulip card from the network
switch, it stops working until I unload and reload the tulip module.
(old_tulip does not help, does the same thing). The rtl8139 module can
apparently cope with this without reloading.
I cannot just start experimenting on the server because I'd have to explain
the downtime to 40 mad scientists =;) so if this is a known problem I'd
appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.
Please CC me, just in case I miss something in the list. Thanks. :)
