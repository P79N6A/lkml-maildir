     Most of you, people, didn`t ever thought about the fact that the money
scheme
  doesn`t simply work at all. That`s it.
  It`s being a _very_ fundamental issue. Look at the history:
  Money were invented as a human work equivalent. What it
  became now - this exercise is for the reader.
  Let me prove my point (and by proving i mean pointing out so called worst
cases):
    1. you are born in a poor family. you can work very hard, but have nothing.
    2. you are employed as a miner. you indeed
work hard. look at a manager
  doing brainfarting 24 x 7 x 365.
  So the life shows that we cannot rely on the
money as a human work equivalent.
  The worst thing is that money corrupt evrything they touch.
  Thats why i`m doing my OSS developement for
free, and i don`t plan to change that.
  Let the freedom be with you. And remember - freedom never comes outside of
you.
