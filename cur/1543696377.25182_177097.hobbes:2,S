While having preemption disabled or while actually holding a spinlock,
preemption is disabled.
Disabling preemption is modifying a count, which must reach 0 again to
have preemption enabled and trigger an reschedule, if needed.
Think of it roughly as a "counter of reasons to not preempt". If there
are no reasons anymore, then we preempt.

Multiple threads can be in the kernel at the same time and even on
different CPUs. But one thread can be only on one CPU at any time.
Threads are parts of processes, so the same applies for processes, too.
