(I don't think implied such an expectation.  On the other hand, we can
do things to make more or less difficult for writers of portable
applications.)

I agree that for practical purposes with respect to waitid(),
"extension" versus "accident" is only about words: we've had the
interface in its current form for so long that changing it shouldn't
be done without consideration.
But (and this was why I constrasted "extension" with "accident"), I
already made it clear that IMO there was another point that was more
important than this specific case:
: And the fact that such accidents happen more often than necessary is
: the real problem, rather than the fact that this API in particular is
: inconsistent with expectations.
but you responded to the point I found less important.
Cheers,
Michael
