OK, so the following address the review comments.
The first two should really be applied before -rc1 if at all possible:
	- the first is a preexisting bug stumbled on while doing this

	- the second is a fix for a regression introduced by my patches.
	  (Apologies!)
(The other three patches, as you say, can wait till after rc1.)
