Activate the nmi watchdog with nmi_watchdog=1 in the boot parameters[*].
That will trip after 5 seconds and point to where it is hanging.  If
the nmi watchdog alone does not give enough data, add the kdb patch
(with nmi watchdog on) and start debugging.
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/ix86/,
 the -ac20 patch should
fit -ac21 as well.
Am I the only person who is annoyed that nmi watchdog is now off by
default and the only way to activate it is by a boot parameter?  You
cannot even patch the kernel to build a version that has nmi watchdog
on because the startup code runs out of the __setup routine, no boot
parameter, no watchdog.
