There are a whole host of issues here that could differentiate your
machine from your freinds', besides the processor....
Have you tried doing a drop-in chip replacement on your machine?  I'm
assuming your K6-2/350 setup is socket 7 and compatible with intel
cpus..... could you grab say a Pentium 200 MMX, drop it into your board,
boot back up and see what happens?
I'd borrow a chip from a freind and try this method.  If the box still
hangs up as before, then the specific process and/or stepping is not the
issue... in which case you can drop your K6 back in a proceed to look
for other issues....
I'd bet strongly on it not being your processor, though...
