I used my old laptop for these tests, where tsc is indeed disabled due to 
instability. Otherwise the kernel was configured with CONFIG_HZ=1000.

Well, it magnifies the rounding problems in CFS.
I mainly wanted to test a little the behaviour of CFS and I thought a saw 
patch which enabled the use of TSC in these cases, so I didn't check 
sched_clock().
Anyway, I want to point out that this wasn't the main focus of what I 
wrote.
