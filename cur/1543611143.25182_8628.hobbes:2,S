Hello,
  Last night, after booting my machine, I just mounted my ZIP disk and 
after a 'ls -la /mnt ', I got an Oops with the message "Attempted to 
kill the idle task!".
  It didn't happen before since I compiled 2.4.14. It always happened 
when I was running 2.4.5 (which is the one that comes in Slack 8 distro).
  Hardware:
    - Athlon 1.2Ghz
    - Abit KT7A-R (with the famous and still not well supported VIA chipset)
    - 256Mb RAM
    - NEC IDE Zip Drive
  Maybe it's something related to the processor as I got messages like 
that when using 2.4.5 which has a buggy microcode for AMD.
  Any stuff or tips on this???
  Thank you,
William
