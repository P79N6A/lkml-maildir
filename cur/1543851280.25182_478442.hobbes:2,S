Hi!
First, it would be nice if we had someone listed as a maintainer of
noidlehz stuff...
Then... I'm getting strange messages from noidlehz each time I
unplug/replug AC power (perhaps due to interrupt latency?).
Disabling NO_HZ and high resolution timers due to timer broadcasting

...I'd expect one such message, not many of them. Something seems
seriously wrong there...
Plus, suspend to RAM and disk is broken in -rc4-mm1. Suspend to RAM
dies with screaming speaker, suspend to disk returns but machine is
mostly toast (and screaming, looks like timer problem, beeps never
end). I'll disable NO_HZ and try again.
