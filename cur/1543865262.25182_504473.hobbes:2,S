I was running likely profiling and I noticed that when I turn on the
"tickless" option I get the following line, 
+unlikely | 21111208|  9367278  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
This means that this line is 21111208 true, and 9367278 false.
This existed on bootup, and stayed after about 7 hours of runtime
(mostly idle). Since need_resched is a "static inline" there are
multiple instances of need_resched() in the kernel. If I turn off the
"tickless" feature this wrong unlikely disappears, and the output looks
like this,
 unlikely |        0|      169  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        0|       94  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        0|       63  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        0|       19  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        0|      379  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        1|   202596  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |        7|   205929  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
 unlikely |     6461|   271690  need_resched()@:include/linux/sched.h@1597
Only a little after boot. I suppose this could be a natural side effect
of the tickless feature but I thought I would report it anyway.
