Introducing new unit *should* be hard. You know, when you introduce
new unit, you automatically break all the userspace.
Having separate files is actually a *feature*. It allows you to
introduce new units while providing backwards compatibility.
Imagine going from mV to uV... With voltage_mV, you can have both
voltage_mV and voltage_uV. In your system, you'd have to change value
from mV to uV, breaking all the userspace....
