That doesn't look possible, which is weird... looks like we are passing
0 to clean_dcache_range().
Interestingly enough, I can -see- possible issues with the ppc32 DMA API
when trying to use HIGHMEM but that isn't the case here... 
Can you add printk's to ati_pcigart.c to print the arguments passed to
+               dma_sync_single_for_device(&dev->pdev->dev,
+                                          bus_address,
+                                          max_pages * sizeof(u32),
+                                          PCI_DMA_TODEVICE);
+
And also print the result of bus_to_virt(bus_address) ?
Ben.
