The most "telling" example is that someone has a $TOPDIR variable.
If it is set to /usr/local and you want to put something in the etc
directory you use: $(TOPDIR)/etc . Now how do you specify a TOPDIR
of "/"? You'll end up with "//etc". 
You could start out by requiring the variable to end in "/". But
nobody does that.
