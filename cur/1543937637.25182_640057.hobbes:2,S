Subject: [PATCH] x86_32: remove the useless NR_syscalls macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/17/587

This is against current x86.git.
The size of the system call table for 32-bit x86 kernels is obtained by
compile-time calculation of the sys_call_table array, not from the value,
which the NR_syscalls macro expands to. This trivial patch removes the
fossil macro.
Manually tested by grepping the x86 files for the "NR_syscalls" string.
No relevant use cases found.
Build-tested using allyesconfig, allnoconfig and a couple of randconfig
instances. All builds successfully finished.
Runtime test performed using a stripped-down Debian-ish config. The system
booted successfully.
