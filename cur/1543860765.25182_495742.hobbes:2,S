Or maybe this rephrase helps:
Regardless of how the IDE quirks have configured the PCI BARs, libata is 
written to assume that /all/ struct pci_dev resources for a single PCI 
device are reserved to the libata driver.
Thus, if you avoid calling pci_request_regions (as your patch does), you 
must manually provide the same guarantees that pci_request_regions 
provides to its callers.
