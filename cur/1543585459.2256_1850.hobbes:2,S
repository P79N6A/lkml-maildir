Regarding the overclocking of the PCI bus, I was not aware of this.  The
documentation led me to believe the pci clock was fixed, however further
experimentation indicates that's clearly not the case.  Thanks.
Regarding the fix:  I installed an Ensonique AudioPci sound card, and
experienced horrible distortion, crackling, and high pitched chirps any
time I tried to use the device.  I noticed that various interrupts were
causing chunks of the real audio to sometimes slip through; on a whim I
tried ping flooding a nearby machine and the sound quality improved
greatly.
Putting two and two together, it occurred to me that the motherboard was
having irq/interrupt routing problems.  The disks could not get reasonable
throughput because the interrupts were getting choked or held up, and the
sound card couldn't properly function either.
Wonder of wonders, I flashed the bios to the latest and greatest version.
Current data transfer rates are 35.7 MB/sec on both udma drives, exactly
as expected and darn close to the continuous read limits of the disks.
The audio also started working, flawlessly.
There are other issues however - the athlon now runs significantly hotter
at idle for one, but the most serious is that the K7 kernel optimizations
cause horrendous kernel panics and crashes.  I'm running now on a kernel
compiled for 386, which seems to be stable.  I'll attempt to build other
kernels to see if I can figure out whats going on.
Net result:  IWill KK266 motherboards have bios problems, it may be a good
idea to upgrade the bios.
