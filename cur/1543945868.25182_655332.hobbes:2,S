I don't think there is anything special about root.
I've been trying to advocate that we remove the *uid == 0 part of this
check since we discussed it in November:
As I said 11/29/07 [Re: [patch 31/55] file capabilities: don't prevent

So, independent of whether SECURE_NOROOT is in effect or not, I think
this particular line should simply read:
~        if (p->uid == current->uid)
~                 return 0;
