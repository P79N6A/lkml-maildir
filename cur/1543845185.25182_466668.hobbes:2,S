OK, I'm running a Fedora Core 6 (rawhide actually) box with -18-mm1 kernel.
I've installed kexec-tools and similar, and am trying to get the kernels
built following the hints in Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt, but a few
questions arise:
1) Other than the fact that the Fedora userspace looks for a ${kernelvers}kdump
kernel, is there any reason the kdump kernel has to match the running one, or
can an older kernel be used?
2) I'm presuming that a massively stripped down kernel (no sound support,
no netfilter, no etc) that just has what's needed to mount the dump location
is sufficient?
3) The docs recommend 'crashkernel=64M@16M', but that's 8% of my memory.
What will happen if I try '16M@16M' instead?  Just slower copying due to
a smaller buffer cache space, or something more evil?
