I've got problem with parallel port - kernel seems to be constantly writing some data to it as soon as it gets loaded by lilo (and thus disturbing communication with any connected device). I have removed the parport and complete paralllel port support but with no effect. Under windows it works just fine (no data is sent until some device is really accessing the port). The data written seems to be connected to CPU usage. Kernel 2.4.21, 2.6.6, MB: K7S5A .. any ideas ?
