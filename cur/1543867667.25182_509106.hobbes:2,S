I actually think that building chains of syscalls bring you back to a 
multithreaded solution. Why? Because suddendly the service thread become 
from servicing a syscall (with possible cachehit optimization), to 
servicing a whole session. So the number of service threads needed (locked 
down by a chain) becomes big because requests goes from being short-lived 
syscalls to long-lived chains of them. Think about the trivial web server, 
and think about a chain that does open->fstat->sendhdrs->sendfile after an 
accept. What's the difference with a multithreaded solution that does 
accept->clone and execute the above code in the new thread? Nada, NIL. 
Actually, there is a difference. The standard multithreaded function is 
easier to code in C than with the complex atoms chains. The number of 
service thread becomes suddendly proportional to the number of active 
sessions.
The more I look at this, the more I think that async_submit should submit 
simple syscalls, or an array of them (unrelated/parallel).
