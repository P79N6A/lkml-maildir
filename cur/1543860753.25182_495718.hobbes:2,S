gcc optimizations were almost completely rewritten between 3.4.6 and 4.1, 
and one of the subtle changes that may have been introduced is with regard 
to the heuristics used to determine whether to inline an 'inline' function 
or not when using -Os.  This problem can show up in dynamic linking and 
break on certain architectures but should be detectable by using -Winline.
