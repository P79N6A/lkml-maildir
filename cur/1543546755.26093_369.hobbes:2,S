[root@dbserver bin]# strace -e shmget,shmctl,shmat,shmdt oninit -i             
This action will initialize Informix Dynamic Server;
any existing Informix Dynamic Server databases will NOT be accessible -
Do you wish to continue (y/n)? y
oninit: Fatal error in shared memory creation
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
Could it be that the max shared memory is too small ?
but /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax = 335544320
whu does ipcs -lm shows a different max size ??
best regards
