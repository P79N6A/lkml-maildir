I've got a vt82c586 here (bought it just for testing of this problem),
and I wasn't able to create any corruption using that board and the 2.4
drivers.
Does anyone still have any vt82c586 or vt82c586a the 2.4 VIA driver is
corrupting data on?
I'd like to hear about such reports so that I can start debugging (and
perhaps get me one of those failing boards, they must be quite cheap
these days).
