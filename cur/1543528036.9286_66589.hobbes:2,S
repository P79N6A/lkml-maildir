With ACPI enabled in the BIOS...
	With CONFIG_ACPI disabled, USB ends up on IRQ 19 and works.
	With CONFIG_ACPI enabled, USB doesn't try to share IRQ 9 with ACPI - 
	it ends up on IRQ 10, but doesn't ever receive any interrupts.
	Kernel says on bootup: ACPI: "ABIT" found at 0x000f7550
	acpid says S5 not supported, as I said before.
With ACPI disabled in the BIOS:
	With CONFIG_ACPI disabled, USB ends up on IRQ19 and works.
	With CONFIG_ACPI enabled, USB is on IRQ10 and doesn't get IRQs
	Kernel says on bootup: ACPI: found PIIX4 at 0x4000
	acpid: started
	acpid: FACP @ 0x012d3400
	acpid: DSDT @ 0x00000000
	acpid: cannot map FACP
Note that the CONFIG_ACPI kernel was 2.3.42 and !CONFIG_ACPI was 2.3.46 - in 
case that makes a difference.
