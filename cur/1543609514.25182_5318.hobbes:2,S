As another data point, I'm seeing the exact same thing. I haven't tried
any non-Linus kernels, though. But recent 2.4.x (x >= 10?) linus kernels
with reiserfs have these several-second delays during moderate-to-heavy
disk i/o, exactly as you've described. I've seen this on both an SMP
PIII system and a UP Athlon.
