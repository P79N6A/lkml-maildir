You must be kidding here. Where exactly do you see devfs fault?
It is not "devfs kernel interface". It is "kernel userland interface"
that requires a major/minor to associate device node with device.
Devfs (in its current shape) is no more than just a repository of
(device node, major/minor) relations. Devfs does not care where
dev number comes from. Driver may hardcode it or request
dynamically from kernel, either way is fine.
Answering your other mail - "devfs kernel interface" provided ability
to request dynamic device number when registering a node. Sounds
very much like what you'd wish. Somebody decided it was evil and
removed it. I personally do not care either way.
