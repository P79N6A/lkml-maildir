Yes, I have not had much time to work on it.  :-(
In testing, I was also able to get crashes which I believe are from receive skb corruption.
It doesn't ever appear in our normal use testing, just when using pktgen against it while it uses pktgen out.  Sadly 
this has pushed it down the slippery priority slope.
I am sorry if I am holding things up.  I will try to put some more time in on this issue as soon as I can.
