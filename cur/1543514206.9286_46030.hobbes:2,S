This is a pentium 233MMX with 64Mb on an ABIT AX5 mboard. It's all scsi
with a noname NCR810A and a Tekram 390F. APM/ACPI are not on in the
kernel and all power management features are disabled in the bios. I
successfully booted & ran 2.3.22, but it had lots of oops when I shut
it down, which seemed to be a known problem, so I didn't report it.
If you need further info, ask.
