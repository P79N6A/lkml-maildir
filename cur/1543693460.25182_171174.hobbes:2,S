You have to explicitly _ask_ for SIGIO. If you do so, and you don't share
file descriptors, that's _your_ problem.
But it does indeed have perfectly valid semantics - the signal may well
just wake up a thread: and in fact, as most IO is illegal in signal
handler context anyway, it usually has to. 
Clearly, if you have per-thread file descriptors, you have to keep track 
of which thread is doing what.
