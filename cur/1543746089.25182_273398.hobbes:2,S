Actually, I think we need a new flag field in the inode_security_struct
to explicitly mark these "private" inodes for SELinux, so that
inode_has_perm() can skip permission checking on them while still
applying checks to any other inodes that may have the kernel SID (e.g.
/proc/pid inodes for kernel threads).
