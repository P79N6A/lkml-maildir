Only the structure definition of fb_vgastate is in fb.h.  For drivers
without a vga core, they'll just won't link to it and it won't be
compiled.  Plus, vga.h is not a common header (not located in
include/asm or include/linux) and it contains a lot of declarations and
definitions which are irrelevant to most drivers or are already
duplicated.  This will be messier, I think.  
Maybe we can just enclose it in a macro, something like:
#ifdef FBDEV_HAS_VGACORE
...
#endif
