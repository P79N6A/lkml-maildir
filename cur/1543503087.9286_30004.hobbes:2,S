     Well, it probably depends on the distribution.  If you've got a
     distribution that boots off the CD, plus loads pcmcia on the
     install image, it shouldn't have any trouble (modulo Sony flaking
     out and breaking support for their cd-rom drive); certainly
     Mastodon, which is not what you'd call a well-funded distribution,
     can install itself off a 505?x without any trouble or floppy drive,
     so I'd suspect some of the distributions which have hiring 99% of
     the Linux kernel hackers can do it as well.
                   ____
