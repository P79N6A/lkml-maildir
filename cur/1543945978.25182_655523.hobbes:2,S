Hello Erez,
Did you notice the e-mail Roland Dreier wrote on Februari 6, 2008 ?

Or: data sent during the first burst is not transferred via one-sided
remote memory reads or writes but via two-sided send/receive
operations. At least on my setup, these operations are as fast as
one-sided remote memory reads or writes. As an example, I obtained the
following numbers on my setup (SDR 4x network);
ib_write_bw: 933 MB/s.
ib_read_bw: 905 MB/s.
ib_send_bw: 931 MB/s.
