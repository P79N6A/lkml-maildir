Sorry - I think I just sent a blank reply to this!  Oops.
I was going to say - thanks.  We'll definitely be using
this kernel since we've found that 2.6.19.2 has a
significantly worse IO profile and either the 2.6.16.40-rc1
kernel or 2.6.18 on otherwise identical machines with pretty
stable loads (so we can compare back to previous weeks).
Now to figure out what's causing the extra load in the
2.6.19 branch!
