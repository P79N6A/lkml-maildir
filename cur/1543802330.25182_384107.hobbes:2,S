Andrew, I think this is a rare (on lkml at least) case when guy
does not want to participate in development in a Linux way
but wants to just pay for development instead:
"I want this <hardware> to work good under Linux. I want to pay
up to <sum> to whoever will agree to do that. Anybody?"
Do not dismiss him lightly. There are LOTS of people which aren't
hackish at all. An order of magniture more than 'us' computer geeks.
M$ is successful because it uses this resource.
We may want to think how can we use it too.
No, I don't think you, or someone else on this list can efficiently
use it, but distros, being more commercially oriented, maybe can.
