did you ever try using it? I'm sorry, but i don't have the time
to recheck every case, but after just a quick look it appears to
still have quite a few problems left [correctness-wise].
[this is not meant as a flame. it's a policy matter. I simply haven't
 looked at the code hard enough to be sure any bugreports would be 100%
 correct. Therefore i cannot go into details at all at this time.]
