No argument.  However, as soon as we do the patch interface and the plain
text interface, BK can be treated as a patch server.  Then we get automated
scripts slurping down the data that way.
If you're willing to use BK just as a transport, it's a far more efficient
transport.  Ask people who have run rsync/ftp/bk all on the same system,
the BK way gets the same information across in less bits.
We're not going to be a patch server or a plain text server on the end of
our little T1 line.  If you want us to do that, then find someone to pay
for another T1 line and I'll happily dedicate it to bkbits.net and apply
the changes you want.
