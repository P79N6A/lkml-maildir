Right.

No, even in the case of select().

Since we have "signal_pending(current)" being true, we _know_ that the 
signal handling path will be triggered, so the ERESTARTNOHAND will be 
changed into the appropriate error return (or restart) by the signal 
handling code.

No. Exactly because sys_select() will always return through the system 
call handling path, and that will turn the ERESTARTNOHAND into something 
else.
NOTE! If you use "ptrace()", you may see the internal errors. But that's a 
ptrace-only thing, and may have fooled you into thinking that the actual 
_application_ sees those internal errors. It won't.
Of course, we could have some signal-handling bug here, but if so, it 
would affect a lot more than just select(). Have you actually seen 
ERESTARTNOINTR in the app (not just ptrace?)
