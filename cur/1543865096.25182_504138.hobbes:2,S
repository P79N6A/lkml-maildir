Ingo, how relevant is that "350 nsecs on current hardware" claim?
I don't mean that in a bad way, but my own experience suggests that
most people doing real hard RT (or tight soft RT) are not doing it
on x86 architectures.  But rather on lowly 1GHz (or less) ARM based
processors and the like.
For RT issues, those are the platforms I care more about,
as those are the ones that get embedded into real-time devices.
