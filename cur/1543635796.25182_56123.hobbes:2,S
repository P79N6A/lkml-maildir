I think I also hit this. Kernel 2.4.19-rc1-ac3. I tried the
-no-pad option. I also tried readcd dev=2,0,0 f=/test.iso,
that failed also.
The latest cdrdao seems to read and make good copies though.
from /var/log/messages:
Jul 13 07:50:14 251 kernel: scsi2: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun
0,CDB: Request Sense 00 00 00 40 00
Jul 13 07:50:14 251 kernel: Info fld=0x50698 (nonstd), Current
sd0b:00: sense key Medium Error
Jul 13 07:50:14 251 kernel: Additional sense indicates 
Unrecovered read error
I will test later with some other media, a different build
of cdrecord, and I will run a cleaner through the drive.
Thanks,
Tony
