16 CPU x440 (about a 2-3 year old NUMA box). flat 4x seems about a 1% 
gain, still statistically significant, but definitely smaller.
I'm not saying there isn't data supporting higher HZ ... I just haven't
seen it published. I get the feeling what people really want is high-res
timers anyway ... high HZ is just concealing the issue and making it
slightly less crap, not actually fixing it.
