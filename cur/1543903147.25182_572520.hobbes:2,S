That doesn't help for any old interfaces, like the one here. For those
still ifdefs are needed. Interfaces that use compat_u64 just use
a normal #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT.
Besides I have my doubts compat_u64 will be the solution
to these worries. We have hundreds of people adding various interfaces
to Linux and it's unlikely they all heard about it. So likely
these cases will occur again and again.
