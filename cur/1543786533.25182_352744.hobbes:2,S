I like that! Nevertheless, for readability one should probably
standardize upon something returing 1 or 0 for a true/false
comparison. I see "(x)?1:0" a lot in the bit-banging code
and I'm pretty sure the compiler knows how to optimize it.
The bang/bang stuff was a way of hiding warnings back in the
days that `lint` was used as a code-checker. It's use should
be condemned to the fullest extent!
