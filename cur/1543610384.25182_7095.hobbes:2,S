As it should be. Page out unused data to make room for more cache. This 
*should* improve performance overall. (Yes, latency suffers to boost 
throughput. A fairly common tradeoff; you'll be glad of it under heavier 
load...)
You have "enough" RAM in that the machine doesn't crash under load, but NOT 
enough that swap would go unused.

As I've said, the VM doesn't always make the right choice :)
