The suggestion of using time interpolation (like ia64) would make the discontinuities
smaller, but still relying on fine grain gettimeofday for controlling servo loops
with NTP running seems risky. Perhaps what you want to use is the monotonic_clock
which gives better resolution (nanoseconds) and doesn't get hit by NTP. 
A bigger possible change would be for the timer->offset functions to return nanoseconds,
then the offset adjustment code could smooth it out. It would save a divide.
