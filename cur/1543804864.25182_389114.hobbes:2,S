This case is rather interesting. At more than one place I've worked,
I found people assuming that the kernel's "pid" was a pid, when in
fact it is a tid. (a "task ID" or "thread ID") The confusion probably
leads to kernel bugs. I've seen many bugs related to this, though I
can't be 100% sure that they don't all involve code that existed prior
to the tgid concept.
