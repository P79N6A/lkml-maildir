It looks good (except that you used spaces instead of a tab in the 
"select" line, but that's only a minor nitpick).
Below is another fix for a different issue that was already present.

<--  snip  -->
SCSI_QLA2XXX is automatically enabled for (SCSI && PCI).
It therefore mustn't select SCSI_FC_ATTRS, since it otherwise 
unconditionally enables SCSI_FC_ATTRS for all users with
(SCSI && PCI) enabled, even when they don't need any support for
QLogic hardware.
This patch also does a cosmetic change for making the "default" look 
more like in other kernel code.
