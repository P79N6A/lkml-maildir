Yes.  And I don't think there are instances of one place in the kernel 
removing pmd and then replacing it in short order.  It either means 
you're doing a large munmap, or the pagetable is being destroyed (and 
therefore isn't currently in cr3 anyway).

Yes.  Obviously any user of pud_clear must do some kind of tlb flush 
before they can expect the effect of their change to be visible.  We 
just need to make sure that its the right kind of tlb flush that 
satisfies the processor's requirements for updating the pgd.  If someone 
went and changed x86's flush_tlb_range to use invlpg then there'd be a 
problem.
I considered hacks like adding a percpu flag saying "the next tlb flush 
of any kind must be a cr3-reloading tlb flush", but that seems a 
little... ugly.
Hm.  Changing PGE in cr4 is documented as flushing the tlb, but is it 
enough to get new pmds recognized?  (yes: see below)
Where is the requirement to reload cr3 after a pgd update documented 
anyway?  The comment in the source refers to "Pentium-II erratum A13", 
which I think is wrong. The Pentium II specification update document 
#243337-049, Jul 2002, lists A13 as "MCE Due to L2 Parity Error Gives L1 
MCACOD.LL"; the only mention of PAE in that document is a bad 
interaction with PAT in some steppings.
The only possibly relevant comment I can find in vol3a is:
    Older IA-32 processors that implement the PAE mechanism use uncached
    accesses when loading page-directory-pointer table entries. This
    behavior is
    model specific and not architectural. More recent IA-32 processors may
    cache page-directory-pointer table entries.
(I'm not sure if "cache" here is the data cache or the TLB.)
Ah, here it is, in "Pentium® Pro Processor Specification Update", 
January 1999, document 242689-035:
    8.         TLB Flush Necessary After PDPE Change
    As described in Section 3.7, “Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs),”
    in the Pentium® Pro Family Developer's Manual, Volume 3: Operating
    System Writer’s Manual, the operating system is required to
    invalidate the corresponding entry in the TLB after any change to a
    page-directory or page-table entry. However, if the physical address
    extension (PAE) feature is enabled to use 36-bit addressing, a new
    table is added to the paging hierarchy, called the page directory
    pointer table (as per Section 3.8, “Physical Address Extension”). If
    an entry is changed in this table (to point to another page
    directory), the TLBs must then be flushed by writing to CR3.
Alright, here's the definitive document: TLBs, Paging-Structure Caches, and
Their Invalidation 
(
http://www.intel.com/design/processor/applnots/317080.pdf
), in which 
section 8.1 confirms that you need to either reload cr3 or one of the 
other control registers which triggers a cache flush:
    The processor does not maintain a PDP cache as described in Section
    4. The processor always caches information from the four
    page-directory-pointer-table entries. These  entries are not cached
    at the time of address translation. Instead, they are always  cached
    as part of the execution of the following instructions:
        * A MOV to CR3 that occurs with IA32_EFER.LMA = 0 and CR4.PAE = 1.
        * A MOV to CR4 that results in CR4.PAE = 1, that occurs with
          IA32_EFER.LMA = 0 and CR0.PG = 1, and that modifies at least
          one of CR4.PAE, CR4.PGE, and CR4.PSE.
        * A MOV to CR0 that modifies CR0.PG and that occurs with
          IA32_EFER.LMA = 0 and CR4.PAE = 1.
I'll put together a patch with a pointer to the proper documentation...
