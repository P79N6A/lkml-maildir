Hello All,
    I decided to do what Linus asked, and try out a 2.5.X kernel.
The machine boots fine with the 2.5.44-ac2 kernel I installed, however
I am having some problems with USB.  The usb-uhci module seems to be
gone.  I read Documentation/usb/uhci.txt and it appears that the
uhci module has been rewritten.  I assume the module named uhci-hcd.o
is the replacement, but I could not find that written down anywhere.
I did an insmod of this module and I can now see the hub in
/proc/bus/usb/devices.  I dont see any of my other USB devices in that
file, even after I insmod the drivers.  Does anyone know what I need to
do to make this all work, preferably in a way that will let me boot into
a 2.4 kernel as well?
Thanks,
Jim
