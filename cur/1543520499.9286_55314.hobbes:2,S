Of course I could use select() with a timeout. However, if keepalive
doesn't work, the function should return some kind of error-code.
I think there are a lot of network clients and servers out there that
think that keepalive should be doing something when, in fact, it seems
to be a dummy function. I don't think tcp_keepopen_proc() will ever
wake up a task waiting for write. It sure doesn't look like it and
it doesn't test like it either.
