That was it: ->check_atapi_dma() needs to inspect the packet
command and only enable DMA for bulk data transfers. With this
change sata_promise successfully both reads and writes CDs.
The rules for which commands should use DMA are taken from
Promise's drivers. I missed this filter originally because it
is located in their high-level Linux glue driver while I was
mostly studying their low-level hardware driver. The filter matches
the corresponding code in pata_pdc2027x.c, with the exception
of an additional no-DMA restriction for WRITE_10 with large LBA.
The patch below goes on top of the first preliminary patch.
