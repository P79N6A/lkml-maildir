Hi,
I've did further testing and I've found out that fortunately it's not a kernel 
problem (sorry for the buzz :-/ ). adjtimex was the culprit. 
adjtimexconfigure said that the CMOS clock is faster by 970secs a day to 
system clock. When I disabled adjtimex and rebooted, the system clock is now 
rock solid and doesn't slew. Now I wonder what's wrong with adjtimex or my 
system. I've tried on several other systems and the it was all the same.
Thanks,
  jan
