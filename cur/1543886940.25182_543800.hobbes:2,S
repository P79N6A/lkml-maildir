That might not necessarily be our fault ... there's no default 'm' for
SCSI in drivers/scsi/Kconfig.  On the other hand, the select directive
can also be the cause of these problems, for instance
drivers/ata/Kconfig has a select SCSI at the top, so if you selected
modular ATA, you'll be forced to have modular SCSI.
