I really, really, really hate git.
Ok, on my laptop I just noticed that "git apply" of the patch didn't complain 
but it also left the empty subdirectories it moved stuff out of.  (I don't 
believe this happened on the version of git I was using on my previous 
laptop, which ate itself a month and change ago, but obviously I can't 
check.)
There is no "git rmdir".  "git rm" refuses to delete the directory 
without -r.  "git rm -r Documentation/x86_64" listed (as just deleted) all 
the files that the patch already moved out of the directory.
Am I missing something obvious here?
