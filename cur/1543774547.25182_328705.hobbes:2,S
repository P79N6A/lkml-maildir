Gee, thanks.  Great attitude.  I'm sure your users love you.
By the way, Groklaw is run by a user.
Ok, I'll bite.  Hans put it best a moment ago:
"Because our code is 90% library routines (aka plugins), eliminating the
plugin layer is like eliminating main() in a user space program."
We want to get a feeling of exactly which plugins you are talking about.
 Because if we pick the wrong ones and spend a few weeks implementing
them, and come back and you think we're still too "layered" or maybe
we've "bloated" VFS too much, and maybe the cycle repeats for another
two years...
What Hans seems to be worried about is having food and rent for two
years, and the fact that in those two years, the XFS guys or the ext3
guys may duplicate enough of the "plugin" architecture that he gets no
credit anymore, AND has to rewrite his stuff to work with theirs.
I have to be neutral on that, as I realize that many of the linux-kernel
people are sick of hearing it and honestly don't care.  And to tell the
truth, I'm a little sick of hearing it, and more than a little sick of
the personal attacks from both sides.
No, as a user, I just want a working plugin architecture to play with
(I'm not *just* a user), and a working Reiser4 'cause it's fast, and I
am eager to see new improvements coming out of Namesys, instead of two
years spent trying to keep up with the vanilla kernel *and* adapt to
some unspecified, possibly unneccessary, decree of a benevolent dictator.
