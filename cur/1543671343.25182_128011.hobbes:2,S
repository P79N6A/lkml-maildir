Sort of.  I used the term "kernel ELF images" to refer to kernel code
that is shared with the user.  I thought that even on x86 this code is
pinned in memory, but perhaps I misunderstood.
Anyhow, it seems to me that using a special filesystem would be more
suitable, as otherwise you get into bootstrap problems etc.
