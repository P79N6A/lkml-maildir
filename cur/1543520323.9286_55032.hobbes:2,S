But what happens when the source code itself is so full of #if KQUAKE
lines that it *really* slows down development.  I say "keep it simple,
stupid".  The kernel should do mostly what user-space cannot (don't we
always complain how windows sucks because the GUI is kernel-based?).
I agree that some things are good in the kernel, but that doesn't mean
they should go in the main tree.
