Ok, this works.
Linus, please apply, thanks!
topology: Fix sparc64 build.
Due to changeset ba84be2338d3a2b6020d39279335bb06fcd332e1
("remove linux/hardirq.h from asm-generic/local.h") the
sparc64 build started failing on drivers/base/topology.c:
drivers/base/topology.c: In function ‘show_physical_package_id’:
drivers/base/topology.c:103: error: implicit declaration of function ‘cpu_data’
drivers/base/topology.c:103: error: request for member ‘proc_id’ in something not a structure or union
drivers/base/topology.c: In function ‘show_core_id’:
drivers/base/topology.c:106: error: request for member ‘core_id’ in something not a structure or union
Adding the obvious fix of including asm/cpudata.h into
asm/topology.h on sparc64 doesn't fix it, in fact it
makes things worse because of the header file dependency
chain:
	linux/gfp.h --> linux/mmzone.h --> linux/topology.h -->
	asm/topology.h --> asm/cpudata.h --> linux/percpu.h -->
	linux/slab.h
which results in:
include/linux/slub_def.h: In function ‘kmalloc_large’:
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: implicit declaration of function ‘__get_free_pages’
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: ‘__GFP_COMP’ undeclared (first use in this function)
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: for each function it appears in.)
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
The simplest thing to do is to add yet another one-off hack like
parts of the guilty changeset did, by putting an explicit
linux/hardirq.h include into drivers/base/topology.c
