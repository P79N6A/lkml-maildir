If by "trying them out" you mean dropping them in the drivers/ide
subdirectory of the 2.4.0 source and rebuilding the kernel, then they
still cause my machine to give CRC errors.
I'm running with an Abit K7 (uses via82c686a in southbridge) with IBM
deskstar 8.4gb disks (DHEA-38451) as masters in ide0 and 1. They only
do UDMA mode 2. I am not overclocking or anything - all should be
running at default speeds with an Athlon 900.  
Just to be clear - I am NOT getting any errors when I switch back to
the 2.2.17 kernel (debian standard) - with a 2.4.0 kernel they occur
every few minutes when there is significant disk activity.
