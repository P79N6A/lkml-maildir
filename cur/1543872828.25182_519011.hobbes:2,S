but what you are adding isnt a plain schedule_timeout(), it is a restart 
block handling loop. And for those restart blocks that relate to 
timeouts, we only use hrtimers. I am not making this up to annoy you: 
take a look at all the current restart block handlers - they are hrtimer 
based, for exactly this reason.

yes but your patch already exists for them which they can pick up.
really, this is a common Linux principle: fix it completely and fix it 
the right way. You are applying it yourself on a daily basis when having 
the maintainer hat on =B-)

your latest patch looks quite kludgy, exactly due to the issues that 
were mentioned.

then there's no rush and lets do this the right way, ok?
