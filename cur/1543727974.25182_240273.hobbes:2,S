the gladman code achieves ~88MB/s for p4 northwood 2.4GHz... without using
mmx.
it looks like your mmx code is 1-2% faster on p-m compared to the gladman
code though -- nice, just a half hour ago i posted wondering if anyone had
taken advantage of the 1 cycle mmx on the p2/p3/p-m processors for doing
the AES XOR steps... and that's what your code does.
unfortunately i don't think that pays off compared to the gladman code on
other x86 processors.
