Subject: [patch 00/11] mutex subsystem, -V7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

this is version -V7 of the generic mutex subsystem. It consists of the 
following 11 patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  mutex-generic-asm-implementations.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-i386.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-x86_64.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-arm.patch
  mutex-arch-mutex-h.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-docs.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  xfs-mutex-namespace-collision-fix.patch
the patches are against Linus' latest GIT tree, and they should work 
fine on every Linux architecture.
Changes since -V6:
 33 files changed, 515 insertions(+), 360 deletions(-)
- added asm-arm/mutex.h ARM mutex fastpath implementation,
  by Nicolas Pitre.
- as per Linus' suggestion, split up the mutex debugging code and 
  prototypes into 4 separate files: kernel/mutex.c, kernel/mutex.h, 
  kernel/mutex-debug.c and kernel/mutex-debug.h, and made the debugging 
  code build as kernel/mutex-debug.o. As a result mutex.c got smaller 
  and easier to read. This also eliminated an #ifdef.
- added a new "NULL mutex fastpath implementation" via
  asm-generic/mutex-null.h, which is now used by the debugging code.  
  This got rid of two ugly #ifdef's in mutex.c, and removed code as 
  well.
- comment cleanups by Nicolas Pitre.
- more doc/comment additions and updates.
- lots of code and style cleanups in various mutex headers.
