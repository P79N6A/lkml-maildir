Applied and tested :-=) The only weird thing is it drew the logo twice 
when I don't have a SMP laptop. It works other than that. 
P.S
  Things I like to get done for the vga16fb driver. 
  1) Its own read and write functions to fake a linear framebuffer.
  2) The ability to go back to vga text mode on close of /dev/fb. 
     Yes fbdev/fbcon supports that now.
