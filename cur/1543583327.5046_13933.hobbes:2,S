ac6 reads the clock speed data from the CPU and also compares it with the
running clock speed. So it thinks you have a chip intended for a 100Mhz
bus. (multiplier 4 FSB 100).
There are two possible causes for that result
#1	You are running a 400/100 component at 533/133
#2	The bus clock tables for intel are subtly different to the ones
	we've managed to deduce so far (Its not properly documented)
