Hi,
I use CASIO CASSIOPEIA FIVA 101s and 103s, please see 
http://www.da-cha.org/fiva/fiva.html
for detail. I also post these patches to fiva users ml(japanese only) and
 the several ten users use this.
I have not recieved the report that it doesn't run or it is crashd. 
Its BIOS is based on award modular bios v.4.51PGM. 
Do you have any trouble with this code?
