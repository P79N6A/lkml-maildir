This seems to be a BIOS-controlled "feature". Early Abit BP6 motherboards
would always remain switched off when power was restored; one of the
recent BIOS upgrades added an option to the BIOS setup offering a setting
for the board to power up immediately power is restored. The same should
be true of other boards, I think?
