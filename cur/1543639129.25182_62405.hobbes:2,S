   The save_flags used to save flags, while local_irq_save saves AND
   closes interrupts, and local_irq_save_off simply does not exist.
   I did not see anything on the list, perhaps nobody is bold enough
   to use 2.5.30?
These things really will die very soon, probably best not
to rely on them at all :-)
