But what about some of those fork bombs? - they may fork 10-20 processes
and all start touching memory simultaneously. The daemon doesn't have
any information on the new processes, It hasn't had time to even read
the proc table.

One fork attack I ran across (it was an "oopsie" by the user) worked as
follows (reduced to just the end result, not the original code):
    while (1) {
	if (fork() == 0) {
	    r = malloc(1024*1024);
	    for (i = 0; i < 1024*1024; i++) {
		*r++ = 1;
	    }
	}
    }
This generates as many processes as possible, each one filling 1MB of memory.
In under 1/2 second all available process slots are in use, all processes
will expand as soon as the daemon kills one of them. When the parent process
fills it's memory it forks and does another 1MB.
The daemon may be able to catch the processes on a uniprocessor system -
especially if it runs at elevated priority. What happens on a SMP box?
One processor is spawning processes as fast, if not faster than the other
can kill them.
When this happend, we managed to stop the user (he couldn't keep up) it was
only because the fork limit quota allowed only 150 processes per user. We
put his job to sleep (it was in batch), then killed it. We couldn't even
keep up (there were 32 processors available at the time). We also promply
cut the number processors available to batch jobs from 32 to 30.
