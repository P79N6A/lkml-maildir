I think this will require a 64-bit expire in the timer_struct 
(actually it would not be treated as such, but the struct would still 
need the added bits).  Is this ok?
I will look at the problem in detail and see if there might be another 
way without the need of the added bits.

Hm...  I changed it to what it is to make it easier to track down 
problems in the test code... and this was user code.  My thinking was 
that such large values are clear errors, and having the code "hang" in 
the sleep just hides the problem.  But then, I NEVER make a system 
call without checking for errors....  And, I was making a LOT of sleep 
calls and wanted to know which one(s) were wrong.
