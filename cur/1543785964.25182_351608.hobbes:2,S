	This summer :
	Coming back from vacation, looking at the logs, I saw that the cupboard  
router-server had kernel-panicked almost daily and rebooted itself  
automatically. I also had a lot of corrupted BitTorrent downloads. I could  
have blamed reiserfs, or bittorrent. But instead, I opened the case and  
found the CPU was overheating due to the fan being clogged by an  
unbelievable amount of accumulated dust and crap.
	reiserfs was still happy, I ran a fsck just to be sure, no errors. fhew.  
I wonder how it's possible. Given the state of the CPU fan, everything  
should have been wiped out.
	I have an all-reiser4 laptop (except /boot) and it's great. No problems  
whatsoever, it flies. Pentium-M kicks ass.
	My jukebox PC is half reiser3 and (since a few months) half reiser4,  
running fine, on the cheapest possible motherboard, and the no-name RAM,  
with an underclocked Duron. The hardware is so bad I had to underclock the  
PC133 to PC100. It has never crashed in 4 years, or got any data  
corruption. Crap hardware is actually sometimes pretty good if you  
underclock it (just have to get lucky). With windows, it used to  
bluescreen just by plugging a cable in the ethernet port.
	My server is all reiser3 too.
	I could have used other filesystems but reiserfs Just Works. No horror  
stories to tell, sorry. I  like reiserfs.
	I don't care it there were very old versions that crashed. I don't care  
about Linux 2.0 or 1 either. Or Netscape 2. That's the past now.
