In my understanding, your worry about robustness is the execution path
when kmalloc() returns NULL.
The most significant point is there.
--[ in the original kernel-2.6.8.1 ]--
    :
  rc = avc_insert(ssid,tsid,tclass,&entry,aeref);
  if (rc) {
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&avc_lock,flags);
    goto out;
  }
    :
--------------------------------------
In the original implementation, avc_insert() returns -ENOMEM when we can't
hold a avc_entry by avc_claim_node(), then avc_has_perm_noaudit() denies
the requested permition check by the reason an avc_node is not allocated.
(But avc_insert() always returns 0, because avc_insert() reclaim a avc_node
 under the spinlock when free_list is empty.)
However, allocating an avc_node and making the decision according to
the policy of SELinux should be separated in considering.
In my approach with RCU, avc_insert() can actually return NULL.
Currently, avc_has_perm_noaudit() returns -ENOMEM without the decision-making
like as the original implementation.
But we can make an decision according to the policy of SELinux by a suitable
recover processing.
My proposal is as follows:
- Normaly, decision-making is performed to the entry on AVC.
  These entries are allocated by kmalloc()
- When kmalloc() called by the extension of avc_insert() returns NULL,
  the decision-making is performed to the entry on stack variable,
  then the entry is not hold on AVC.
-- e.g. in avc_has_perm_noaudit() --------------
    :
  struct avc_entry local_ae, *ae;
    :
  node = avc_insert(....);
  if (!node) {
    SETUP_LOCAL_AE(&local_ae,&entry.avd);
    ae = &local_ae;
  } else {
    ae = &node->ae;
  }
  
  if (avd)
    memcpy(avd, &ae->avd, sizeof(*avd));
    :
------------------------------------------------
By this method, the decision-making is available irrespective of
the result of kmalloc(). Is it robustless?
The original implementation has too many lock contensitons in Big-SMP
environment. It is more positive to consider the method using RCU.

Ooooooops!
It is toooooo trivial BUG!
I'll fix them very soon.

Indeed, it is right. I'll fix them soon.
avc_update_node() is in the section between rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock().

Oops!
I agree, and fix this soon.
Please wait for a patch, thanks.
