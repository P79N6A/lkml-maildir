In the log you posted, the drive posted 51/04 to your out-of-bounds
request, but these are 59/04, do they span the end of the device or
something?
I'd be surprised if the drive clunked because of an out of range
command, that model of drive used a very mature interface firmware
with many generations of testing and qualification.
