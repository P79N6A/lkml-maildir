Coding-wise, it is no problem. MODULE_* gets transformed into char
__mod_*line, so as long as you have the two MODULE_AUTHOR() macros on
different lines, it will work.
It is cool to actually see this working out-of-the-box with modinfo
too (even without the -F option). Could decouple a few AUTHOR lines.
