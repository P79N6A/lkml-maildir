I'd have to check, but iirc it was just MMIO.  We assumed PIO (inX/outX) 
was defined to be very strongly ordered (and thus slow) in Linux.  But 
Linus is apparently flexible on that point for the new ioreadX/iowriteX 
stuff.

Well, Alpha has smp_barrier_depends or whatever, that's *really* funky.

Ah, ok, sounds like your chip needs an ISA extension or two then. :)

This sounds like ia64 acquire semantics, a fence, but only in the 
downward direction.

Weird, ok, so for cacheable stuff it's equivalent to ia64's release 
semantics, but has additional effects for noncacheable accesses.  Too 
bad it doesn't tie the two together somehow.

Hm, interesting.

Agreed.  Having a set of rules that driver writers can use would help 
too.  Given that PPC doesn't appear to have a lightweight way of 
synchronizing between I/O and memory accesses, it sounds like full 
syncs will be needed in a lot of cases.
