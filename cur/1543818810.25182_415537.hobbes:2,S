Though I'm not real fond of Denis's last patch, I think I prefer it's 
style to this, solely because it removes more code when VLANs are 
disabled -- you've left the spin_locks in, and have more #ifdefs.
Regardless, I remain opposed to this particular instance of bloat 
busting. While both patches have improved in style, they remove a useful 
feature and make the code less clean, for no net gain.

On SMP FC4, typhoon.ko has a text size of 68330, so you need to cut 2794 
bytes to see an actual difference in memory usage for a module. Non-SMP 
it is 67741, so there you only need to cut 2205 bytes to get a win.
Every byte counts, except when it doesn't.
