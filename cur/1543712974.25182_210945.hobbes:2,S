that is a specialized backdoor to do I/O on _private_ pages, it's not a
general-purpose library function for doing anonymous pages
swapin/swapout, infact the only user is swap susped and we'd better
forbid swap suspend to pass anonymous pages through that interface and
be sure that nobody will ever attempt anything like that.
that interface is useful only to reach the swap device, for doing I/O on
private pages outside the VM, in the old days that was used to
read/write the swap header (again on a private page), swap suspend is
using it for similar reasons on _private_ pages.
the idea of allowing people to do I/O on anonymous pages using that
interface sounds broken to me. Your code sounds overkill complicated
for allowing something that we definitely must forbid.
