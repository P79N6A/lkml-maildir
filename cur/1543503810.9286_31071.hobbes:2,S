First, disabling symetric interrupt delivery per interrupt can be done
in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c. Search for PIC_IRQS.  This means that
any interrupt can be setup to only go to the boot CPU. The make sure you
FS process is running on the other CPU.
Secondly, the sound card works like a very nice timer but you do not
need to use interrupts to take advantage of that. Instead, if you
have on CPU dedicated to the FX processing, you can easily phase
lock on the sample rate of the sound card. To do this setup the
sound card in circular mode and MMAP the DMA buffer into a user
process.  Then keep the entire DMA input buffer at some
fixed MAGIC value. When the DMA card trashes this value your
user level process easily tracks this and restore the buffer
magic behind the DMA pointer. This makes it possible to get the
lowest possible lattencies. Limited primarily by the PCI burst
DMA block size and possibly by buffering in the sound card.
(We use ess1370 and ess1371 (note that many ess1370 show
 spectral peaks and is rather low quality))
Third, here is a patch I use on i386 linux SMP systems.
The patch allows a process to lock onto a CPU, offers some
additional IRQ stats to above all give info about cache
invalidations.

We use this to run two 1371 sound cards for a course in applied
signal processing of audio signals. I do not have any time to
support this!
The overall setup in this course is that matlab is running on
the boot CPU and a dedicated C/C++ program is running on the
locked CPU to do hard real time audio processing - FIR filters
and what not.
Some cmex primitives has been added to matlab to fork of a
locked process that communicates to matlab through shared
matrices. The students love this setup :-)
In general I think that the debate about multimedia in linux
is too focused on non trivial "fixes" in the kernel when there
is so much that can be done in user space with really minor
kernel changes. Infact, my patch for locking CPU´s 
has decreased in size of the years.  Also, MMAP was designed
for close operation to the hardware, use this instead of
read/write.
Given the cheap SMP boards based on Celeron an SMP system
should not cost much more then a single CPU system
(unless Intel disables the SMP support of the Celeron in the future).
