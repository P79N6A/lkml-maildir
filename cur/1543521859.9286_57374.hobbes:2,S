For those of you interested in threading and scheduling issues, a paper we
have written
about our experiences with Java, Volanomark, and Linux is available on the
Linux Zone of
IBM Developer Works:  
http://www.ibm.com/developer/linux.
You can also take a look at the CVS directory there that contains some
initial patches for
Linux.
