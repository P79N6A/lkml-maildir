TR is screwy at the moment in 2.3.30 anyway, trying to slam lots of packets through the interface (i.e. ftping a 17mb kernel image on a local ring) locks the machine up solid. This is the same on both the olympic and tms380tr drivers. 
I'll look into this and see what is going on.
I'm also compiling up 2.3.30 on my trust 486/50 to test ibmtr and see what the recently reported problem is.
