 I don't think so. How to you want to implement non-shared /tmp
 directories? The chroot is overkill in this case. See:

 They can mount to /mnt where the directory is shared ("mount
 --make-shared /mnt") and visible and all namespaces.
 I think /share/$USER is an extreme example. You can found more
 situations when private namespaces are nice solution.
