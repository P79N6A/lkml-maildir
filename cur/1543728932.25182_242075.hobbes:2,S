Patchset update.
These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness with 
specific emphasis on the desktop, but configurable to any workload.
Web site with faq:
http://kernel.kolivas.org
Patches:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-ck1/
Added since 2.6.7-ck6:
+sched-adjust-p4gain
tiny p4HT nice handling optimisation
+1g_lowmem_i386.diff
Allows 1Gb of ram to be used without enabling highmem
+kiflush1.diff
A slow cache clearing memory defragmenter for desktop (see web page 
faq); *Rather unorthodox and orthogonal thing to do but is beneficial on 
the desktop*.
+token-thrashing-control.patch
Rik's swap-thrash control patches
+*latency*
A number of low latency hacks from Andrew Morton
Changed:
~from_2.6.8.1_to_staircase7.I
Staircase scheduler updated to latest
~schediso2.5.diff
Tiny sched_iso change for optimal compatibility with s7.I
~hard_swappiness1.diff
A tiny relaxation of the "hard swappiness" algorithm to allow mapped 
pages to swap out below the vm_swappiness watermark if extreme memory 
pressure is occurring (prevents oom).
Merged:
~cfq1.fix
~cfq2.fix
~cfq3.fix
~cfq-bad-allocation2.fix
~crq-fixes.diff
~1100_ip_tables.patch
~1105_CAN-2004-0497.patch
~1110_proc.patch
Removed:
-bootsplash-3.1.4-sp3-2.6.7.diff
Framebuffer code changed too dramatically and code getting difficult (ie 
a lot of work) to merge safely in current state.
