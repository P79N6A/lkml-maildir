Hi All,
I might be very wrong but I am trying to do following
1. I have a 4 node cluster and nfsv3 in all the nodes of cluster with
server running in one
of the 2 nodesconnected to shared storage and 2 other nodes are acting
as clients.
2. If nfs server node crashes, I need to failover to another node
wherein I need to have access
to the lock state of the previous server and I need to tell the clients
that the IP address of the
nfs server node has changed. IS IT POSSIBLE or what can be done to
implement it?
Another scenario is..
1. When one of the client crashes, it has to failover to another client,
in that case if client
crashed with some locks held how the newly come up client going to grab
the lock again
when it is not released? Again the server might already be taking care
of it but I am not
sure about it.
I hope I can use NFS for this kind of set up and if not what will it
take to have this kind of set
up usinf NFS?
Regards
Rashmi
