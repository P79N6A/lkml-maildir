Hmm I'm not really sure what it takes to make it cpuset aware; it was Nick 
that pointed out that it was not, so I'm not sure and still going off your 
original recommendation that there was no need to make it cpuset aware but at 
least honour node placement (see below).

Thank you for agreeing on me there :)

It would be absolutely trivial to add a check for 'number_of_cpusets' <= 1 in 
the prefetch_enabled() function. Would you like that?

It is numa aware to some degree. It stores the node id and when it starts 
prefetching it only prefetches to nodes that are suitable for prefetching to 
(based on a number of arbitrary freeness arguments I invented). It uses the 
original node id it came from by allocating a page via:
	alloc_pages_node(node, GFP_HIGHUSER & ~__GFP_WAIT, 0);
where "node" is the original node the swapped page came from.
Thanks for comments.
