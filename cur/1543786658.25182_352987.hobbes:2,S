I would much rather have it my way :)
Well, the main reason is that if that code is somehow copied
by to a lock-free critical section, it could cause problems.
If you dereference ->fdt multiple times in a lock-free
section, you could see two different pointers due to
a concurrent update.
I would advise sticking to the same convention everywhere.
