I don't have that. (I also don't have C++. What's the no-C++ ksyms thing?)
The same thing happens on a Pentium IDE box.
The register dump is different but the Code: is the same.
Care to see for yourself?

cp the above to a floppy. 
write-protect. 
Reboot with that in the drive. 
Hit enter at the LILO prompt/message
Hit enter at "VFS: Insert root floppy.."

That floppy is geared to boot on as many x86en as possible without modules.
It will boot with no HD. (That may take some fancy LILO kernel args.
The only time I've booted something like this with no HD was with the
skip-IO-region thing to get past an MCA RAID adapter. So actually it's
known to boot *thinking* there's no HD.)

Nope :o)
That's a 1.44 meg floppy, as I said. Notice that I didn't list libc.
(pre-quote)"Well, that's pretty useless without libc." 
Not entirely. My Forths have all the Linux syscalls available as
keywords. Commands like "sync", "getpid" and so on are no code. Syscalls 
that take arguments need some code. A wrapper for mount e.g. would add 
something like 100 bytes to the size of one of the Forths. 
BTW, I have as much success going to 2.88 with 1.44 diskettes 
as with actual ED-marked ones, which I'm stingey (stinjy?) with.
Hmmmm. Is there a need for a general way to generate an oops?
This looks pretty general. Meanwhile, it's a dessert-topping AND
an alternate user-space!
