v4l2 support could not have been broken, since it was never present.  
You were going through a compat layer.... Maybe that's where the 
regression is.
Anyhow, I will discuss this with the other v4l guys... One of us will 
get back to you, maybe ask you to test a patch or two.
One question -- At exactly what point does this break for you?  The git 
commit key above was from today, but at what point did this LAST work 
for you?  It would be really helpful if you can do a git bisection test, 
so that we can isolate the trouble patch if in fact it is a regression.
You might also like to join us in #v4l on irc.freenode.net ... Sometimes 
it's much quicker to troubleshoot this stuff over irc instead of email.
