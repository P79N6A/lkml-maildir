If the process was stopped before swsusp was invoked, the process will
never reach refrigerator() and therefore never set the PF_FROZEN
flag. Without the test for TASK_STOPPED, swsusp gives up and claims
that it can't stop all processes.

Note that the old code always called wake_up_process(), which is
necessary to make the process run one more iteration in refrigerator()
and relize that it is time to unfreeze.
The patch changes things so that wake_up_process() is NOT called if
the process is stopped at some other place than in refrigerator().
This ensures that processes that were stopped before we invoked swsusp
are still stopped after resume.
I manually clear PF_FREEZE here in an attempt to handle a race
condition, but I realize I need to understand more of the scheduler
and signal code before I know for sure if this is necessary and/or
sufficient.
