Hi Andrea,
 From our perspective prctl is the most attractive approach. Performance
is not an issue, as it's only used once during startup. The problem
with /proc is that we are not always able to access /proc (e.g.
java code is run with chroot). Stack overflow in chroot'ed program
probably is a corner case, but I'm afraid we'll have to deal with it
if the heap-stack-gap becomes more widespread. System call is better
but we need to remember different syscall numbers on different
platforms.

Sounds good.
