Well I've tried for several hours now to get netconsole working, but it just
won't give me output.  I've tried using both built in as well as module, and
I've tried two different clients using both netcat and syslogd on different
ports.  The most output I ever get is when loading the module I manage to
receive one message saying "netconsole: network logging started".  I've
verified all the netconsole settings are correct in the kernel logs when it
loads.  I'm not one to give up easily, but this one's got me stumped.
I know the option to use a printer is out...I might be able to manage a
serial connection, but I'll have to rebuild my kernel to support it.  I'll
look into that later...
