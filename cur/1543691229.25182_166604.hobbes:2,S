That is hardly a serious comparison: the workaround is just to stop the
oopses while this gets sorted out.  It makes no pretense at either
efficiency or permanence.

We don't know how much of this difference is due to removing the branch and
how much is due to reenabling prefetch.
It would be interesting to see comparative benchmarking between prefetch
and no prefetch at all, see whether this feature is worth its icache
footprint.
