This whole affair is especially disappointing for me, as I just got a Phillips 
webcam up and running the other day using pwcx.  Will some kind soul please 
post something indicating which files contained the hook?  Was it part of pwc 
somewhere?  I'd like to compare the older kernel sources I have to the 2.6.8 I 
just downloaded so I can see what I need to change in order to keep pwcx 
working.
