You can't do that reliably, some architectures requires different
access for ISA vs PCI vs random-other busses. The driver needs to be
aware what bus it's trying to go through.

That might be nicer from the driver perspective but it will make
readb/writeb a lot more complex and inefficient for no reason on some
architectures.
The driver will have to know whether it's on a PCI, ISA or directly
attached anyway when it's probing so it's perfectly reasonable to
expect it to deal with that when it's accessing the registers as well.
Cheers,
Jes
