I was just looking at agp_copy_info(), which contains this code:
   318 	if (bridge->mode & AGPSTAT_MODE_3_0)
   319 		info->mode = bridge->mode & ~AGP3_RESERVED_MASK;
   320 	else
   321 		info->mode = bridge->mode & ~AGP2_RESERVED_MASK;
   322 	info->mode = bridge->mode;
This looks wrong to me, since line 322 overrides the previous 4 lines'
work...
I have no idea whether this is actually causing a problem, but I'd
thought I'd call attention to it.
