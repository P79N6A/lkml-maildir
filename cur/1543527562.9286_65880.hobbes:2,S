Hi,
	I am almost tearing my hair out of frustration.  If anyone can
shed any light on my situation I would be MUCH appreciative.
Machine:	Dual PII/400, 512MB ECC, MicroStar MS-6120N
		AMI MegaRAID 428, 5 SCSI Wide 4GB HDD on 2 channels
		Adaptec AHA3985 3-channel w/ CD-ROM, CD-R, scanner, MO, HDD.
		DE-220 (NE2k clone) ISA 10Mb/s NIC, 3C905 PCI 10/100 Mb/s NIC
		Matrox Millennium 8MB, Logitech Marble Plus trackball PS/2
Problem:
	[1] I was unable to make Linux see more than one Logical Drive.  When
	    booting up, there is a message making it clear that the driver
	    sees two Logical Drives, but only find one of them as /dev/sda.
	[2] I can't install using standard Red Hat 6.1 Graphical Install.
	    The install process conks out with a Python error.  Text-based
	    install will conclude normally, but when installing will only
	    see TWO DRIVES.
	[3] When installing, the kernel sees megaraid first; when rebooting
	    after install, the kernel sees aic7xxx first, result is a kernel
	    panic.  This is solvable by disconnecting the aic7xxx first, do
	    the install from the megaraid (at least disconnect all HDD-like
	    devices), recompile kernel with megaraid compiled in and aic7xxx
	    as module, then plugging in the HDD's on the aic7xxx.  But there
	    surely is a better way!
	[4] Back to 1; I still need to use the other logical drive.
	HELP!!  THANKS FOR ANY ASSISTANCE ...
