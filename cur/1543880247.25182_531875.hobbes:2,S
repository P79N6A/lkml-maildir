Well, there's short term fair and long term fair.  Seems to me a burst
load having to always merge with a steady stream load using a short term
fairness yardstick absolutely must 'starve' relative to the steady load,
so to be long term fair, you have to add some short term unfairness.
The mainline scheduler is more long term fair (discounting the rather
obnoxious corner cases).
