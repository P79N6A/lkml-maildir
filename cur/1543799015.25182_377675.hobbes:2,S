I wish I could add something to the thread here. Sorry for not kicking
in before, I did not see it.
I remember a problem with the 100Ve and the 1000MT giving issues when it
is a LOM or even a PCI adapter. I used to fix a lot of these problems by
removing all power from the board molex, maybe the "battery" on the
mother board for some minutes and then plug-in everything back in.
Basically, the NIC wouldn't negotiate or will act funky, like no link or
no real connectivity.
Dunno if you already tried it, hope it helps.
