That was on a P4, although I've seen pretty similar results on ia64 and
other x86 CPUs.
Note that this was with my ptl removal patches. I can't see why Christoph's
would have _any_ extra overhead as they are, but it looks to me like they're
lacking in atomic ops. So I'd expect something similar for Christoph's when
they're properly atomic.
