He never got it, and the webpages you put up with that info didn't
have that information either.  Please just keep the list updated;
I don't have much time for such things.
And for that matter, all followups _only_ to linux-usb-devel please!
This discussion shouldn't be CC'd to three large lists (IMO).

The message only comes out in one place (drivers/usb/core/hub.c),
so there's only one way it could appear...
Clearly this external hub is misbehaving, that should never happen.
Maybe it needs more power than it's getting.
However, even if the hub driver does see a fault, that's no excuse
for khubd to lock up.
