Yes, it is almost same as the first version, except a little
difference : descendants of node [r] is [r * 2 + 1] and [r * 2 + 2]
(comment:the size of element is ignored), but yours is [r * 2] and [r
* 2 + 1] .
The tree you build is :
       [0]
        |
       [1]
      /   \
    [2]   [3]
   /  \    /  \
 [4]  [5][6]  [7]
Not same as standard tree :
       [0]
      /   \
    [1]   [2]
   /  \    /  \
 [3]  [4][5]  [6]
We can find the standard algorithm here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort
 .
So , in every shift-down operation (comment: In sort.c, it is after
heapify , second loop in /* sort */ section ), [0] will compare with
[0] and [1], and always swap with [1] . Performance lost here .
