Because the file handle which we have is for /dev/raw/raw0,
not for /dev/hda1.
The raw driver binds to major/minor, not a file*.  I considered
changing that (change userspace to pass the open fd).  But didn't.
An alternative would be to rewrite i_mapping for /dev/raw/raw0
to be bdev->bd_inode->i_mapping.  I guess we should look at doing
that.
