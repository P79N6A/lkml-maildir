Seems to be a rather common problem and probably that
is why only Mark Hahn has replied so far, but
searching through Google most other computers seem to
get a clock drift of only 1 minute per day at worst,
and I have consistently seen my system clock doing 4
minutes a day slower than its hardware clock, my other
PC and my VCR.
This is rather odd, has anyone experienced anything
like this on the Vaio Crusoe before?
Regards,
Michel
