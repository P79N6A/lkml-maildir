Please look at Compaq's press release:

For the impatient:

The Linux Driver for Compaq Smart-2 PCI Disk Array Controllers is beta software
that enables developers by providing them a source code base and
specifications.  
Developers interested in the Linux Driver for Compaq Smart-2 PCI Disk Array
Controllers are open to further develop, test, and support it.  Compaq does not
provide any warranty or technical support. The Compaq Linux Driver for Compaq
Smart-2 PCI Disk Array Controllers is provided under the terms of Version 2 of
