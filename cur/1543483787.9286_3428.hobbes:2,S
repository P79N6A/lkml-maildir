I had similar problem, the solution was to add the proper address to
the list in driver source.  If you can test which port the card is on, then
just add this address to the front of this list.  If you can't then add
a list of possible addresses (0x200, 0x220, ...) and recompile lance.c.
Somewhere in drivers/net/lance.c:
static unsigned int lance_portlist[] __initdata =
				{ 0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360, 0};
in my case:
static unsigned int lance_portlist[] __initdata =
				{ 0x220, 0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360, 0};
