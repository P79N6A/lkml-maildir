Sorry, I wrote that in a hurry. Its a 3Com PCI 3c905C Tornado. I can 
successfully use wakeonlan if I power off the machine immeadiatly after 
turning it on. Using the shutdown command, which it will when I need it 
to power back up, it will not work.
Im using a wakeonlan cable to my motherboard as well, not using wake 
through PCI bus.
Kernel is 2.4.1
I appologize for not providing all required the specs in the original 
message.
