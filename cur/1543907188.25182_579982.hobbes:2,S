That's what I noticed :-)
I did not even know that was supported!

What made me hesitate is that I'm not 100% sure that all those sections
are used only in .text everywhere they are used. Maybe some of them
sometimes appear in .text.init, so finally I preferred not to play
dangerous games with this. In fact, I prefer the risk to break gcc-4.2
to the risk of breaking everything.

I don't think either. Other people certainly rely on such a feature
to be able to switch their sections by hand using one asm statement.
At least my fix looks unintrusive enough for me and works, so I'll
stick to it for now. And if something finally breaks, it will only
be gcc 4, the last one supported, so the less likely to affect well
established toolchains.
