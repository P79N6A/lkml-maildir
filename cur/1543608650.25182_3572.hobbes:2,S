I'm not sure what you want to ask, though I guess you're not
too happy about the fact that niced processes still get a lot
of CPU time in Linux ;)
If this was what you wanted to say, this is something I've been
planning to fix for a while and, now that my VM has been removed
from the kernel, I'll have some time for too...
