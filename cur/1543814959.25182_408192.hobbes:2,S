Yes, the results are approximately the same.  Booting from port 0 (sda)
with ADMA enabled still results in timeouts on port 3 (sdc) while
running tars on the RAID1 array on ports 2&3.

After a while, syncing the filesystems hangs the sync process, though
the system continues to function, and I can log in on another VC.
The good news: no long latencies from the status inb() during the
period that it is functional! :-p
Booting without ADMA gives the usual stable behavior, with the long
latencies from the status inb().
I was a little disconcerted when I saw this this in the trace with ADMA
disabled,
   tar-21466 0dnh. 3979us : nv_check_hotplug_adma (nv_interrupt)
until I realized that this
        if (!adma_enabled && host_desc->host_type == ADMA)
                host_desc->host_type--;
only alters the outcome of the "host_desc->host_type == ADMA" test, but
still uses the ADMA-based hotplug functions.
