I have received your previous message, but only saw it after I sent mine.
(I read lkml from a different address than the one I send from, and only
check the mail received at the latter once a day)
And it appears your mail doesn't reach lkml anyway. ECN perhaps?

Can that be done with the ones already modified by klogd? Note that when I
talked about almost immediate hard crashes, I really meant that. Within a
second (or two or three at max) a number of new oopses are generated, ending
in a final one with the "killing interrupt handler" message. And these don't
even show up in the logs because the machine doesn't sync anymore at that
point.
I also don't have a serial cable handy.
But I'll see what I can do.

Note that this is not really the issue (anymore). I did this already, and
basically just left out the #if. But now I'm getting oopses when I actually
try to use a drive attached to it - which is probably caused by another part
of the last driver change than this detect issue.
