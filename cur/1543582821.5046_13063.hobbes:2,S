This is sometimes feasible, but sometimes it is a hack with painful
consequences in the form of software incompatibilites.

Linus' strategy is to not let optimizations for uncommon cases inflict
the common case.  However, I think we can make an improvement here that
will work well even on moderate-sized directories.
My main problem with the fixed-depth tree proposal is that is seems to
work well for a certain range of directory sizes, but the range seems a
bit arbitrary.  The case of very small directories is also quite
important, too.
