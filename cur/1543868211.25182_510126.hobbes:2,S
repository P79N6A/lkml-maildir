Artem,
        This patch introduces the Makefile before any of the source
files, which means it will break "git bisect" operations.  Could you
please refactor your patches so that the tree will build after any
point in your patch series?  
	BTW, I'm not personally found of having a separate .h file for
every .c file; in my mind a much better division is a public and
private header file.
