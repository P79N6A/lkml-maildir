Hmm, well the sched-less-idle patch is in mm5, which brought
2.6.5-rc3-mm4 to 2320 on ext2.
The only other significant scheduler changes since that kernel
are in -mm5.
+sched_less_idle
+sched_balance_context
So either sched_balance_context is causing a regression that
counters sched_less_idle, or maybe it isn't a scheduler problem?
