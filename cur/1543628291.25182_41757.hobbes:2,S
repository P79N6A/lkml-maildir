in the pre-bk past i've seen "that's fixed in my tree" with no reference
to how to get "my tree" -- this repeated by many folks, including linus.
for those of you with issues against using bk, you should just pretend
that's what you're reading.  you can even respond with "could you make a
snapshot available?" like folks used to.  you can even go pick up the new
daily snapshots.
so your frustration is either not a new thing, or has been solved.
