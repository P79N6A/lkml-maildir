Hi,
    I don't know about your PPP problems as I don't use PPP anymore, but you are
using the wrong device node for a usb mouse.  The node should be a char device,
major = 10, minor = 32.  I believe this was changed when the HID stuff was added
in.  Another thing to watch for is that you need to make sure you have either
'USB Human Interface Device (HID) support' or 'USB HIDBP Mouse support' selected
along with 'Mouse support'.  Here's a list config options I have set that are
needed for the mouse:
CONFIG_USB_HID=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_MIX=y
CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y
You should probably use the full HID support rather than HIDBP(boot protocol)
support.
