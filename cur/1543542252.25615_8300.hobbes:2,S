To reduce confusion, I'd like to change the name.
pid becomes task_id
tgid becomes posix_pid
The terms "pid" and "thread" get eliminated from the kernel.

The tty layer stuff is defined... this isn't a "may".

If signals get fixed for 2.4.x, then this is a trivial extra.

Per-thread alone isn't allowed. For 2.5.x at least, there must be
a common queue in addition to the per-task ones.

This might not need kernel support.

Nope, the first thread to unblock will get the signal. If this gets
too messy it can be saved for 2.5.x of course.

From a quick glance at SUSv2, I'd say n+1 are required.
One per thread, plus another one for the process.
I'll have to study the SUSv3 draft a bit to be sure.

Truly shared, with locking and all, would be a problem...
but how about pushing out changes to all the other tast structs?
This ought to be SMP-friendly I think.

That isn't quite enough, because these tools need to know if they
should be adding up numbers or not.
Example: you have four tasks and two address spaces of 80 MB each.
The "top" command should display that 160 MB is in use.
VM identifiers and/or pre-calculated values must be supplied.
I suppose you'd accept whatever can be done without locking?

OK. Existing kernel users of CLONE_PID get CLONE_SMP instead?
(that is, they get their own bit)
Might it be OK to severely change get_pid() for speed?
I'm thinking that a per-CPU pool of free PIDs would be good,
with free bits migrating in large blocks as needed. Also it
might be nice to have (pid & SLOT_MASK) be usable to look up
a pid number.

The arguments for "performance" and "Transmeta" should apply.
An OS with good Java support would share translated code across
users and would not give Java processes unique address spaces.
