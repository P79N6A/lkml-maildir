This issue was raised on the list a few months ago. Someone's opinion was
that the firmware is not executed by the same processor that runs Linux,
thus it's data, not code. Uploading a firmware is like printing an image
on the screen. Anyway I can upload the firmware from userspace. On most
(but not all) cards I only need the firmware at startup, so I also save
memory. Some cards also have an ASIC which must be loaded. That data is
not code because it's not executed.
