This is the part I don't like
 #define memcpy(t, f, n) \
 (__builtin_constant_p(n) ? \
- __constant_memcpy((t),(f),(n)) : \
+ __builtin_memcpy((t),(f),(n)) : \
  __memcpy((t),(f),(n)))
Notice? Our old __constant_memcpy() would do the rigth thing for large 
copies. In conrast, I don't know that gcc will do so.
