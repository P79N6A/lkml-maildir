You should run "make" first, then after that completes run "fakeroot  
make deb-pkg".  I think this is similar to what the Debian package  
"kernel-package" does, except it substitutes an alternate "debian/"  
directory.  IIRC, it just runs "make install" as a normal user to a  
staging directory, then runs "$(ROOTCMD) dpkg-deb -b [...]" to build  
the package.  IMHO it's somewhat of a cleaner solution, and I've used  
it for several years now with no issues.

I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you  
looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
