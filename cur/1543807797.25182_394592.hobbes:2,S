I assume you have your own setjmp implementation and are not using the
libc version?
If you don't then there is a problem.  There is a good reason why the
constants are removed: you couldn't use the values anyway.  Your don't
have the information to "decrypt" them.  If you just used the values
and implemented the function yourself, fine.
