No. At least twice there were fundamental changes in the Linux kernel
architecture and most if not even all drivers broke. They were fixed
over time but some kernel releases (2.1.x and 2.3.x) had a definitive
"do not enter without mop and bucket" written all over them.
You still seem to have not understood why there is a Linux Kernel
Project, what it is for and who should benefit from it.
Answers: 
- Because there are some people who want to hack in an *ix Kernel.
- For fun.
- Noone cares.
You're still asking the wrong questions. Linux and the Linux development 
people didn't ran around and asked for fame and commercial success. Fame 
and commercial success came to Linux *BECAUSE* of the way Linux kernel 
and software development works. Not the other way round. 
I just don't remember the leading penguin posting:
"Hey, I've started to write an OS which will be in some years be POSIX
compliant, giving Microsoft, SUN and SGI sleepless nights and will be
one of the few OSes in the market place with rising server
numbers. Come all and join in."
If you want to play here, there are rules. You can't apply the rules
of other games (... they all support binary compatibility ...) just
because no one cares for your rules. If you don't like the rules for
software development in the Linux kernel, go away.

Yes they will. Remember i740 XFree Server and so on?
If you want binary compatibility, I would suggest that you build
against the few widespread Linux distributions (RedHat, debian, SuSE,
Caldera, Mandrake, oh jeez, looks like you need lots of download
space... ;-) ) and whenever they release a new official kernel
package, you release a new binary compatible driver. Messy but that's
how Windows and OS/2 drivers work, too. The only difference is that
you get a new Windows Kernel only once every four to six years...
