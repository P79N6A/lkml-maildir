x86-64 software optimization guide says:
 For functions that create fewer than 25 machine instructions once
 inlined, it is likely that the function call overhead is close to,
 or more than, the time spent executing the function body. In these
 cases, function inlining is recommended.
Of course you need to consider whether the code is speed-critical
to begin with.
