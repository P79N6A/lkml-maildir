Since the last version of it received no comments on the interfaces, here
it goes a version, that I feel ready for inclusion.
The comments regarding style, specially the elimination of the #defines in
the desc_struct definition were merged. I also implemented the vmi
functions,
missing last time.
Ingo, in the absense of further complaints, could you please push to the
x86 tree?
