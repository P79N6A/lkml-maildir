Agreed. 2.2.x works just fine for us on our servers (some have been up for over a year, some maybe longer, but the longer they're up without problems, the
easier it is to forget they even exist ;) I am using 2.4 because my personal MoBo is so new, it's the only kernel that will work worth a darn on it. I am also
wanting to upgrade some servers as soon as a more stable kernel is available because there are some improvements in the newer kernels that I feel could be of
great benefit (but then that's my personal view, and not necessarily a company view). It has been long known that even numbered kernels are stable kernels, not
necessarily bug free (nothing is, escept for what I write ;-), and odd numbered are development kernels. By this definition, 2.4.x kernels are stable (in most
cases it seems it's the hardware that's not).
