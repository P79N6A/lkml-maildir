I'll digress some more ;-)
Actually, what I want to stress is that the greatest benefit of this patch
is not removing the unneed checks to processes that can't migrate (it is a
benefit though), but the real benefit that I'm looking forward to is the
migrating of lower priority tasks that can migrate. And these tasks wont
be affected by tasks that can't migrate.
Looking forward to your next patch.
