Yeah, and the thing I think it _totally_ and utterly broken is that there 
can be only one of these per process.
I don't see where the 1:1 idea comes from, except from a bad 
implementation.

And this is also again nothing but the result of a bad implementation.
From a system maintenance issue, this is a nightmare. It makes joining a 
group nigh impossible, since now the joiner (login or something) has to 
keep track of what pag's it has used for previous logins. Which is fine as 
long as you have _one_ login authority, but it's a total disaster to 
require that kind of centralization.

Yes. And apparently PAG's - as you see them - are nothing but a AFS issue.  
As such, I think they are totally uninteresting for the core kernel, and I
will _not_ be applying any patches that introduce such a limiting and
stupid notion into the core kernel.
I'm interested in a much more generic issue of "user credentials", and 
here a PAG can be _one_ credential that a user holds on to. But to be 
useful, a user has to be able to have multiple such credentials. While one 
might be his "AFS userid", another will be his NFS mount credentials, and 
a third one will be his key to decrypt his home directory on that machine.
If it's useful for AFS only, I'm not interested.
