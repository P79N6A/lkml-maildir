Ingo,
I've noticed the following situation which is caused by __up_mutex
assigning an owner right away.
Given 3 processes, with priorities 1, 2, 3, where 3 is highest and 1 is
lowest, and call them process A, B, C respectively.
1.  Process A runs and grabs Lock L.
2.  Process B preempts A, tries to grab Lock L.
3.  Process A inherits process B's priority and starts to run.
4.  Process C preempts A, tries to grab Lock L.
5.  Process A inherits process C's priority and starts to run.
6.  Process A releases Lock L loses its priority.
7.  Process C gets Lock L.
8.  Process C runs and releases Lock L.
9.  With __up_mutex, Process B automatically gets Lock L.
10. Process C tries to grab Lock L again, but is now blocked by B.
So we have a needless latency for Procss C, since it should be able to get
lock L again.  The problem arises because process B grabbed the lock
without actually running.
Since I agree with the rule that a lock can't have waiters while not being
owned, I believe that this problem can be solved by adding a flag that
states that the lock is "partially owned".  That is the ownership of the
lock should be transferred at step 9, but a flag is set that it has not
been grabbed. This flag would be cleared when Process B wakes up and
leaves the __down call.
This way when process C tries to get the lock again, it sees that it's
owned, but B hasn't executed yet. So it would be safe for C to take the
lock back from B, that is if C is greater priority than B, otherwise it
would act the same.
If you agree with this approach, I would be willing to write a patch for
you.
