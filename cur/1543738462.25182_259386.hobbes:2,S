I have Geoff's figures 
Before:             32p     4p
     Warm cache   29,000    505
     Cold cache   37,800   1220
After:              32p     4p
     Warm cache       95     88
     Cold cache    1,800    140
[Measurements are CPU cycles spent in a call to del_timer_sync, the average
of 1000 calls. 32p is 16-node NUMA, 4p is SMP.]
These figures, would apply for the case for where del_timer_sync does get called from del_single_shot_timer_sync.
That is del_singe_shot_timer_sync gets called after timer has expired
For my profiling workload i used the standard pg_regress module from the postgres installation and noticed that
the ratio of calls to del_single_shot_timer_sync after expiry to before expiry was 10:1. over 11000 calls to
del_single_shot_timer_sync.
