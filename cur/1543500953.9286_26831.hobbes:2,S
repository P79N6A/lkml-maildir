Are you sure? With some limits-checking it should work, compiler
just subtracts N words from the stack-pointer to make room and
since the compiler 'knows' it did this, it still 'knows' where
everything else is.
The kernel stack is limited is size, but a few hundred bytes for
temporary storage should be available.
