yes, that is an option ... we find that utilizing the board files "better" as:
 - the boot syntax tends to be a little unwieldy
 - embedded boards dont change, so if you're defining so much
board-specific information in the boards file, the partition map makes
sense there as well
 - the dynamic partitioning aspect of declaring the map at runtime is
unnecessary due to the previous comment
but each to their own i guess
