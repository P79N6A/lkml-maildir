This server was working fine under load under FreeBSD, and worked fine before 
with other tasks under Linux. I dont think it is RAM.
Additionally it is server hardware (Dell PowerEdge) with ECC, MCE and other 
layers, who will report about any hardware issue most probably, and i think 
even better than memtest. 
Additionally it is very difficult to run test on it, cause it is in another 
country, and i have limited access to it (i dont have network KVM).
I have similar crashes on completely different hardware with same job (QOS), 
so i think it is actually some nasty bug in networking.
