Hi,
I don't know really which subsystem this, so I'm sending this to the 
linux-kernel list.
Please direct me to a more appropriate place if this is not correct.
I'm using a 3ware 9500 with Linux 2.6.18.1. I've grown the HW 
raid5-array and here is where the problem begins. After the card had 
expanded the array, I used "blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdk" to get the 
kernel to recognize the now larger device. The last step was to do a 
"pvresize /dev/sdk". The problem is that pvresize still thought that the 
device was at the original size.
 From the lvm mailinglist I found out that pvresize used the same 
mechanism as "blockdev --getsz" to get the size of the disks, so I 
tested this and found that blockdev also reported the device to have the 
wrong size.
So, if I do:
# cat /sys/block/sdk/size
4882708480
and
# blockdev --getsz /dev/sdk
3906166784
Apparently /sys/block/sdk/size is updated with the new size, but 
whatever "blockdev --getsz" and "pvresize" is querying is not. If I 
reboot, everything works correctly.
Best Regards,
/LM
Ps. please keep me as Cc: on this; since I'm not subscibed to the 
linux-kernel list..
