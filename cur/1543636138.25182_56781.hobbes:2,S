We got one here about two weeks ago. It had 2 AMD processors plus
2 'sticks' of RAM (Don't know how much). It was originally tested
on an IDE drive booting Windows/2000. It worked, but a CPU had to
be removed because W$ trashes drives when using two CPUs.
I got to play with it for an hour. I put one of my BusLogic SCSI
controllers in one of the 33MHz slots and booted Linux off an existing
SCSI drive. It did not run long before crashing (I booted a SMP
kernel). Again, I booted it with only one CPU and it did not crash.
I don't know if it's an AMD problem or a Motherboard problem. Perhaps
AMD processors don't work well in SMP, I've always used Intel with
success.
Nevertheless, I was entirely unimpressed with this "MPX" board. It
didn't have built-in SCSI like older Tyan boards that I currently use
and it didn't work very well. My AGP graphics card (G-Force) didn't
work either (in graphics) although I'm told that 'newer' ones do.
It is also kinda expensive (over US$200).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
