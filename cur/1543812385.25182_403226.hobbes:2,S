hello !
thanks to all for providing that information.
i think i will take a closer look on device-mapper, but i'm unsure if it`s 
perfectly suited.
can i only use devices, not files for the cow?
what about merging a cow-dev/file back to the r/o-dev/file ?
cowloop can do this, and because it can use files, i don`t need to provide a 
fixed amount of diskspace for the cow.  you have direct feedback about how 
big you cow grows....
i'm unsure about dm, but i will dig into the details. (wanted to learn more 
about dm anyway)
any chance of cowloop being merged into mainline ?
loop.c is 1343 lines of code, cowloop.c is around 1000 lines more so it`s 
"reasonable" small....and it has a _really_ nice user manual.
regards
roland
ps:
btw - mountlo looks really "freaky" - i like uml very much, but i think i 
need each bit of performance.
will take a look at mountlo just for personal interest, though.
