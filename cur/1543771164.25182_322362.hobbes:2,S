	What would you predict the results of the pi test with --tasks 10 
and --depth 3 ?
	From the docmentation it looks like depth N adds N milliseconds to 
the locking latency . It seems like increasing the numbers of tasks would 
also increase the locking latency by M tasks == M milliseconds. But I 
thought I would ask to be sure..
