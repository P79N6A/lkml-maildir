It strikes me that this is very fragile.  If the application calls
anything out of /bin or /usr/bin etc passing a path name which works
for the application, it will break for the helper.
It also requires all binaries use by the application to live in the
same directory.  This would be OK  for some applications, but not for
everything.
It sounds to me like you want a private, inherited, name space, and
Linux provides those via CLONE_NEWNS, however you probably need root
access to make that work, which isn't ideal.
I think you'd have move luck (ab)using an environment variable.
Make
   /proc/self/env_prefix
be a symlink pointing to whatever the "PREFIX" environment variable
stores.
Then you just need a little shell wrapper around the app with
something like
   path=`readlink /proc/$$/fd/255`
   export PREFIX=`dirname $path`
   exec $PREFIX/$APPLICATION
and build the application with
   ./configure --prefix=/proc/self/env_prefix
I'm not saying this is a "nice" solution, but I think it is no worse
than /proc/self/exedir/, and it should be more robust.
