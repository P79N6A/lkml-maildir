I already adjusted it. :-)
But, In my desktop, I couldn't make to consune my swap device above
half. (My swap device is 512M size)
Because my kernel almost was hang before happening many swapping.
Perhaps, it might be a not hang.  However, Although I wait a very long
time, My box don't have a any response.
I will try do it more.

I mean I will test your patch by myself.
Because I already have a embedded board and Desktop.

I agree with you.

I didn't say your patch had a regression.
What I mean is just that I am concern about it.
Actually, Many VM guys is working on server environment.
They didn't try to do performance test in embedde system.
and that patch was submitted in mainline.
Actually, I am concern about it.

Could you send me that debug code ?
If you will send it to me, I will test it my environment (ARM-920T, Core2Duo).
And I will report test result.
