It would have been nice to have corresponding data for the async path.

I wouldn't say so. Adding async vectored I/O to the 2.5 code won't make 
it more complex since the underlying functions
do handle iovec's anyway.

It seems to be a case of "complexity is low, benefits are unknown". I 
guess the best thing is to develop a patch and see what people think 
about the complexity part. The benefits part will become clear only when 
the async interfaces are reasonable functional and we can compare the 
following
- call async readv directly
vs
- multiple calls to io_submit using one iocb (each call corresponds to 
one element of user's vector)
vs
- single call to io_submit using multiple iocb's (each iocb corresponds 
to one element of user's vector)
Since the raw/O_DIRECT interfaces offer asynchrony (through Badari 
Pulavarty & Mingming Cao's patches), it should be possible to test this 
out.
More on this shortly,
