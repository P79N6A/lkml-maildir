Please try to reproduce on:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.9_andrea-VM3.gz
(it's against clean 2.2.9)
About being slower without swap I think it's because if we don't find
something to swapout we never return from swap_out(). I think we should
simply return 1 even when unmapping page/swap cache pages (if the
reference count of the page is equal 1, and that means the only refernce
belongs to the page cache and so the next shrink_mmap can do progress in
freeing memory). I'll do some test soon.
