  Yes, ext3 has something similar. But actually ext3 would have to insert
inode in the orphan list anyway - in delete_inode we do truncate and
for it we also insert the inode into the orphan list because truncate
can be too large to fit into a single transaction.

  Hmm, I'm just not sure whether unlink cannot somehow race with open
(at least I don't see any lock that would prevent open while unlink is
in progress)...
