Hi Linus,
I have 8 patches for you. 7 are s390 related, one is a bug fix for sysfs.
I'll put Pat on CC for this one but I am very confident that it is correct.
Short descriptions:
1) The usual arch bug fix collection for s390.
2) Kconfig update. Arnd added a condition to BLK_DEV_FD in
   drivers/block/Kconfig so that we can use it in the s390 config.
   In addition the s390 block device configs now reside in
   drivers/s390/block/Kconfig where they belong and VLAN_8021Q=m
   && QETH=y not works.
3) The sysfs memory leak fix. On s390 we have a stress test that
   sets a disk online and offline all the time. Without this patch
   we are out of memory after a few minutes because dead dcache
   entries are not freed. With the patch the test runs fine.
4) Make use of module_param in s390 drivers.
5) Some fixes for the common i/o layer.
6) Minimal bug fix for the dasd driver.
7) s390 network driver update.
8) s390 docu update.
blue skies,
  Martin.
