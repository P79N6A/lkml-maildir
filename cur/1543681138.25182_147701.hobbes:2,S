I didn't say I agree with all of Moguls ideas, just his anti-TOE
arguments.  For example, I also think RDMA sucks too yet he thinks
it's a good iea.

On send this doesn't matter, on receive you use my clever receive
buffer handling + flow cache idea to accumulate the data portion of
packets into page sized chunks for the networking to flip.
You obviously don't understand my ideas if you think that it matters
whether there is some relationship between the MTU and the system
page size necessary for the scheme to work.
