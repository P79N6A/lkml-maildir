Possibly, but remember that printk() is an admission of failure.  It's
only useful to developers, and the only reason for printk over
pr_debug() is for users to report to developers when guests crash.
pr_unimpl() means exactly what it says: the guest asked for something we
don't support.  If that turns out to be the last thing in the logs
before a crash, it's a clue.  The rest of the printks should probably
move to pr_debug().
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
