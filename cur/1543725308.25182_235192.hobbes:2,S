It appears the "final" patch never made it into Linus' tree?
In any case, I'm certain the fix I submitted is needed, but I wouldn't
claim I understand all of the exit path handling---it's become rather
complicated with the NPTL-changes.  For example, one thing I don't
understand in forget_original_parent() is that it traverses the
father->children list and then does the check:
		if (father == p->real_parent) {
AFAIK, if "p" in on the father->children list, that implies that
(p->real_parent == father).  I suspect a typo here and
"p->real_parent" should read "p->parent", but I'm sure whoever wrote
this code must have tested it, so it's probably more likely I'm
missing something.
