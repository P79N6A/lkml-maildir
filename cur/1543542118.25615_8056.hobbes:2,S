So you would prefer a two level threads library ? 
[you probably agree that it is silly to have java programs with 20 threads
each eating a kernel stack -- and there are not only java programs which
use that wasteful programming style. java programs at least have the 
excuse of a stupid API that forces them to do such stuff]
continuations are just a lot of what the two level library would do in user 
space put more efficiently into kernel space (like multiplexing poll)
