This patch can improve do_select() ==> select() performance due :
1) the load from the fd bitmap is done every __NFDBITS instead of every bit.
        If You look at the BITS() macro You'll see that it's not cheap in terms
        of memory operations
2) if a sequential hole of __NFDBITS is found it'll be skipped without doing a
        bit by bit check
