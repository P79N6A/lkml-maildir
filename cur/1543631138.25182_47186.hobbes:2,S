Basically I could agree with it, but something looks wrong. Why exactly
is pte_free_tlb() needed in first place? Why does it call
tlb_remove_page()? A page mapped into user space has little to do with a
page used as page table. Latter is never in the user tlb, so it doesn't
need to be removed from it, so calling tlb_remove_page() is just a more
complicated way of calling __free_page() or am I missing something?
bye, Roman
