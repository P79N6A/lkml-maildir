   Does/Will this driver support NICE-extensions as does the Broadcom's
   driver? I've been successfully using broadcom's driver with the
   nice-patched vlan-code for a couple of months now..
NICE is a gross hack and I would hope that Ben Greear would have
better taste in the interface he chooses for hw VLAN acceleration in
the 802.1q layer :-)
NICE was explicitly left out and this was done on purpose.
