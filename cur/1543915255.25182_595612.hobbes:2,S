Afaik, our patch was done a while ago and nobody every submitted it
upstream - don't know why...
At AC, we follow RH/Fedora packages and there we had glibc-kernheaders -
where our patch originates. When the glibc/kernel packages changed and
glibc-kernheaders died, I patched the syscalls into kernel headers; Not
thinking that I better submit it upstream. :-(

Yes, 2.6.22, I've just encountered the problem with 2.6.23...

As I wrote in my previous mail, that's true, but if Debian folks haven't
recompiled glibc against the new headers we can change it without
breaking something...
