Power managment should be done in the kernel, that's why there is sysfs 
and the kobjects. But it can't be done properly if some process from 
user-mode (even root processes) do access the hardware directly.
Power managment isn't the only reason why it shouldn't be done, but also 
everything related to the device managment etc. There should always be a 
driver between a process and the hardware as a protection.

Well... that's why I don't understand why we should keep the VGA code in 
the kernel. It's very unlikely that the kernel crashes before a graphics 
driver can be initialized (if you do this as soon as possible) unless 
you have a bad CPU etc.
