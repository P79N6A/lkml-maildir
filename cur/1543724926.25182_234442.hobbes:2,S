Subject: ppc64 compile error

I was trying to compile a kernel for ppc64 and had the following problems:
1)
rivers/video/imsttfb.c uses the function "nvram_read_byte"  but it is not 
defined in this architecture.
2)
the ppc64 architecture doesn't have agp.h. This prevents 
drivers/char/agp/backend.c from compiling.
3)
sound/ppc/pmac.c includes asm/feture.h but it could not be found:
sound/ppc/pmac.c:36:25: asm/feature.h: No such file or directory
Removing the corresponding options from .config results in a successful 
compilation.
