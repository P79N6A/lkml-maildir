Topology, yes, I'm likely in favor of it.
Processor number: no.  Unless you want to rip out hotpluging.  I'm
certainly in favor of that, it creates huge problems for  no real
benefit for the common use cases.  But as it is, the number of
processors is not necessarily constant over the lifetime of a process.
The machine architecture is.
