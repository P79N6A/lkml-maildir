Windows NT/2000 has flags that can be for each CreateFile operation
("open" in Unix terms), for instance
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY
  FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH
  FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING
  FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS
  FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN
If Linux does not have mechanism that would allow the signalling of
specific use case, it might be helpful to implement such a hinting system?
Disclaimer: I am clueless about what the kernel provides at this time.
