Hi,
I'm having problem with my x86_64 workstation. I'm having about
5 kernels oops a day and usually I got that in the syslog:
Apr  4 12:45:07 oshawa kernel: Assertion failure in
journal_start_Rsmp_2519e07e() at transaction.c:249:
"handle->h_transaction->t_journal == journal"
I'm using:
Linux oshawa 2.4.21-20.ELsmp #2 SMP Wed Mar 23 18:32:06 EST 2005 x86_64
x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.
Any idea where I should start to look at.
Thanks,
Eric Desjardins
