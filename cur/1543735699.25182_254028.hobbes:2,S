The hash function looks like choosing the nth node whose corresponding
bit is set in node_online_map such that linear_page_index(vma, address)
(why isn't it using linear_page_index()?) mod num_online_nodes() is n,
which actually appears weak compared to various hash functions I've
seen in use for e.g. page coloring. The hash functions I've seen in use
are not tremendously more expensive than mod, and generally meant to be
computationally cheap as opposed to strong.
The kind of scheme you've employed for MPOL_INTERLEAVE is what would be
called "direct mapped" in the context of page coloring, and Ray Bryant's
would be called "bin hopping" there. A nontrivial (though not
necessarily complex or expensive) hash function mod num_online_nodes()
would be considered hashed, and the last category I see in use
elsewhere is a "best bin" algorithm, which tracks utilization of bins
(for page coloring, colors; here nodes) and chooses one of the least
utilized bins thus far.
I'd expect all 4 alternatives (and maybe even a variety of hash
functions for address hashing) to be useful in various contexts,
though I'm unaware of which kinds of apps want which algorithms most.
I don't have any idea what kind of difference the variations on the
locality domain for Bryant's bin hopping algorithm make; I'd tend to
try to make it similar to the others' precedents, but there may be
other interactions.
