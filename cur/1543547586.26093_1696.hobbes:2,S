Excuse me?  How the hell do you expect them to "clean up their act" when
their "dialup" users are the problem?  Are you gonna scan 250,000 machines
to make sure they aren't running SMTP servers?  Trap all port 25 traffic?
It's the same problem EVERY ISP has.  RR is just higher profile because
of the number of users.  Cable/DSL are unlike traditional dialup in that
you are always connected as long as the machine is on.
Nobody at rr.com can send Alan email, so be it.  If Alan want's to be an
ass, he's entitled to -- he is British after all *grin*
