kmem_cache_alloc_node() is part of the slab API and it is reasonable that
it be exported in this manner along with the rest of that API.  If someone
wanted to use kmem_cache_alloc_node() and found it wasn't exported like the
rest of the slab functions, that would look weird.
So I don't think we need bother going through the drawn-out pain of
retracting an export which has been in-tree for a year or so.
