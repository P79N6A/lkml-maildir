The reasons for this may be obvious with more understanding of how the 
TAB came into existence, but given that the Linux Foundation isn't 
limited to kernel development (see the desktop architects stuff, for 
instance) it seems a bit odd for it to have a technical board that's 
determined at a kernel-only event.
