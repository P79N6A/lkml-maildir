The BSD and Linux gcc will produce close to identical code and different
libcs. If libc is involved then its still clearly a valid benchmark just
different things need fixing

A benchmark from an outside source, with no bias, with source code and no
huge fees is a rather nice thing. 
Richard Gooch has a performance monitoring patch for Linux. The PMC registers
on the PPro and higher can count many types of cache misses which may be
most enligtening
