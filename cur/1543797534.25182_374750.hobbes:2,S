Oh, cool. That makes life a /lot/ easier - most laptops I've seen using 
SATA are ICH6, so excellent!

Well, we could always just add it to ata_piix and leave it out of the 
acpi and scsi layers. I've no great atachment to ACPI - I just want this 
stuff to work :) Basically, ACPI gives us the possibility of making 
hotplug/unplug work on hosts that don't otherwise support it under a 
limited set of conditions. I think that's worthwhile, especially if it 
can be done in a way that doesn't introduce hugely ugly stuff to the 
rest of the kernel.
