I decided to do one simple little thing -- make PCI device resources show
up in /proc/iomem and /proc/ioport on ia64 just like they do on i386.
Of course, I found two bugs in the process so we have three logically
separate patches that I shall be sending in reply to this message.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
