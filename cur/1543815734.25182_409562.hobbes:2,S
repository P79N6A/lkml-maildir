That already works pretty much (userspace tools have to pass 
xencons=ttyS as well as console=ttyS0).

Yes, that could live alongside this driver.

Easy except that Xen can't implement the 'console backend', or at least 
not easily. The console bits need to end up in management virtual 
machine's user space. We'd have to do something skanky like the current
