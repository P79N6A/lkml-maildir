Don't have the flimsiest idea what an iVDR drive is but I take it that
it's some sort of special purpose thing.  :-)
So, the HHD424020F7SV00 is the second device which isn't happy with
150ms wait after reset.  The first one was Quantum GoVault.  It's a bit
different in that the HHD only fails after hardreset.
Anyways, so, it seems we'll have to extent the 150ms wait.  I'll try to
cook up a patch for that && parallel probing.
Gary, IIRC, the requirement for GoVault was 3secs, right?  Paul, can you
try to estimate the minimum required delay?  Please go down by 100ms and
report where it breaks.
Thanks.
