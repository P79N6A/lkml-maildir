Well, you've said it thrice (the bellman cried) but that doesn't make it
true.
The way a user space solution should work is to schedule mmapped I/O
from the backing store and then send this mmapped region off for target
I/O.  For reads, the page gather will ensure that the pages are up to
date from the backing store to the cache before sending the I/O out.
For writes, You actually have to do a msync on the region to get the
data secured to the backing store.  You also have to pull tricks with
the mmap region in the case of writes to prevent useless data being read
in from the backing store.  However, none of this involves data copies.
