Hi Robert,
I think you will find this problem is caused by NIS, partly.
I'm not sure of the exact details, but apparently tar tries to lookup via NIS,
the UID and GID of the files inside the tarball, and because they dont actually
exist on the local system, this causes a few second delay looking up the (mostly
non-existant) NIS server.
A quick fix is to remove any mention of NIS out of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file
Regards,
Chris.
