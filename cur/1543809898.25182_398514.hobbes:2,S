It hits only arrays - so I took a look into moduleparam.h.
Looks like an __initdata tag is missing?

With this change static struct kparam_array __param_arr_##name is placed
in .init.data.
This made the warnings in drivers/input/joystick/db9 disappear.
And with db9 marked __initdata there should be nothing wrong in
using __initdata for __param_arr_##name as I see it.
Rusty - any comments on this?
