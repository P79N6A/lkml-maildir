The script was done for 2.4, where initramfs wasn't an option.  (I mentioned 
it being old, and a bit crufty.)
The original poster was saying they were having trouble creating a 2.88 floppy 
image, which is most of what that script snippet does.  (The bit that 
actually creates the root ramdisk that floppy uses was earlier in the script, 
and not included in the snip.  I believe the script just had a line to copy 
the ramdisk file onto the floppy image...)
