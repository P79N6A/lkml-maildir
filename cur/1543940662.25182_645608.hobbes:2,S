Subject: Elf loader crash while zero-filling .bss

----[ The context
I am relatively new into kernel hacking and I am trying to get Linux
running on a ARM based SBC.
I already did my work adding support for the board in my working copy
of Linux 2.6.22.10. The kernel already boots and runs small assembler
programs I've written for testing (with the boot parameter
init=myprogram).
Now I am trying to execute some bigger C applications: in instance
BusyBox. I've chosen the buildroot package in order to produce a small
"distro".
Then I've tried to boot the system using init=/bin/sh but I am getting
a crash while loading this non-toy binary.
And believe me, this is not a problem of EABI/OABI compatibility (I
hope I could cope with that without messing here), seems more serious.
----[ The details
From the perspective of the user nothing is shown at the console
(literally nothing)... but using the debugger I can see a "data abort"
exception happening at binfmt_elf.c (load_elf_binary).
The offending code is the following:
  	930		/* Calling set_brk effectively mmaps the pages that we need
 	931		 * for the bss and break sections.  We must do this before
  	932		 * mapping in the interpreter, to make sure it doesn't wind
 	933		 * up getting placed where the bss needs to go.
  	934		 */
-	935		retval = set_brk(elf_bss, elf_brk);
 -	936		if (retval) {
-	937			send_sig(SIGKILL, current, 0);
  	938			goto out_free_dentry;
 	939		}
 -	940		if (likely(elf_bss != elf_brk) && unlikely(padzero(elf_bss))) {
-	941			send_sig(SIGSEGV, current, 0);
  	942			retval = -EFAULT; /* Nobody gets to see this, but.. */
 	943			goto out_free_dentry;
  	944		}
Stopping the debugger at the line 935 I can see the values passed to set_brk:
 set_brk (0x000a4ec8, 0x000a4ec8).
This allocs exactly one new physical page for the virtual address 0xa4000.
Then, stopping the debugger at line 940 (just before the crash) I see
that elf_bss is 0xa3801 and PAGE_SIZE is 4096, so padzero is going to
to zero-fill the bytes from 0xa3801 to 0xa3fff (2047 bytes).
Tracing instruction by instruction into padzero and it subsequent call
to clear_user leads to a data exception when trying to write 0 the
address 0xa3801 (the first byte!).
I know I should provide more details in order to get some help.
 The exact Linux version, gcc version and compiler are the following:
 Linux version 2.6.22.10  (abel@debian) (gcc version 4.2.1) #13 Fri
Nov 30 09:49:41 CET 2007
   CPU: XScale-PXA255 [69052d06] revision 6 (ARMv5TE)
The sections listing of the offending elf binary is relevant too (I think):

----[ Some questions
I have the following questions:
1) I don't think the assumption in the code comment is valid in my case:
 	930		/* Calling set_brk effectively mmaps the pages that we need
 	931		 * for the bss and break sections.  We must do this before
My .bss section spans from 0xa3801 0xa4ec8 but the page set_brk allocs
goes from 0xa4000 to 0xa4fff.
Then padzero writes to an unallocated area.
Is the assumption in the comment wrong?
2) May this crash have some relation with this (already solved) one?

3) I haven't taken a look into the code generated by gcc but someone
in ARM Linux list showed a piece of badly generated code in another
context. Should I try do downgrade the compiler used for my kernel?
Which is the official gcc version for the kernel?
Yours, Abel.
