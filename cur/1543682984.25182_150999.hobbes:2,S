Subject: passing my own compiler options into linux kernel compiling

Hello,
I use gcc-3.3 and I would like compile my kernel with flags:
-O4 -march=pentium3 -mcpu=pentium3
Is there any way to do this?
Maybe there should be a possibility in menuconfig and xconfig for users
specify their own compiler options.
What do you think about this people?
Michal
