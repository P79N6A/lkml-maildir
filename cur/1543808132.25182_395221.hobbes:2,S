After having digested this I think there is something sane with regard to
this container idea.  I still think the implementation is totally wrong but
there is a potential problem the basic idea solves.
In the traditional linux/plan9 style of namespaces the question is
which resources different tasks share, and we pass clone bits to determine
what we want to share and what we don't want to share.  Semantically this
is very clean and allows for a great deal of flexibility.  However
as the flexibility increases we get more code in do_fork more
reference counts and ultimately the performance decreases.  In addition
it is not common for us to change which resources we share.
So our traditional route is flexible but it does not optimize the common
case where we share all of the same things.  Containers can potentially
optimize that case.  So long as anyone can create a new container even
someone inside a container we do not loose flexibility.
To deal with networking there are currently a significant number of
variables with static storage duration.  Making those variables global
and placing them in structures is neither as efficient as it could be
nor is it as maintainable as it should be.  Other subsystems have
similar problems.
So if we put econtainer in struct thread_info and optimize it like we
do current, create an interface to variables similar to
DEFINE_PER_CPU, create a syscall interface similar to clone, and
show that by doing this we don't loose flexibility, then it looks like
a good idea.
If we can't do better than the current clone model of shared resources
then this model feels like gratuitous change.
