Again, if you did it this way, the lower MPOL_FLAG_SHIFT bits of the new 
'flags' member would always be zero if you are still going to use the 
MPOL_F_* defines from linux/mempolicy.h to do your bit testing.
I do not subscribe to the theory that just because we have a couple extra 
bytes of space somewhere in struct mempolicy that we have to use it 
immediately.

It makes the kernel code simpler, in a way.
Now we only have to pass a single actual among functions that include both 
the mode and optional flags (there are a lot of them and they span not 
only the VM but also filesystem code).  The catch is that we have to use a 
mpol_mode() wrapper for mode conditionals or switch statements.
But testing the flags is just as easy as
	if (mode & MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES) {
		...
	}
That test would remain unchanged (except for s/mode/flags/) if flags were 
stored in a separate member.
So by storing them both in an 'unsigned short' member of struct mempolicy:
 - we don't use any additional memory (and we can use those two extra
   bytes you identified earlier later), and
 - we only have to pass a single actual to many different functions that
   require both the mode and optional mode flags.
