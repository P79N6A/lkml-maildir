You really aren't thinking, are you?
It's not about keeping Tivo happy. It's about keeping *me* happy. That's 
my primary (only) motivation for a license.
And let's go back to why I selected the GPLv2 in the first place, shall 
we?
I want to be able to use other peoples improvements. If they release 
improved versions of the software I started, I want to be able to merge 
those improvements if I want to.
Your *IDIOTIC* suggestion is explicitly against the whole POINT! By saying 
that I shouldn't accept contributions like that, you just INVALIDATED the 
whole point of the license in the first place!
Can you really not see that?
