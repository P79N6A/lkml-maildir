    Could these "fixes" resolve any issues with the vt82c686a Southbridge?
For the life of me I have yet to be able to get my FIC VA-503A (that uses a
vt82c686a Southbridge for UDMA66 support) working correctly under Linux
2.4.x (or 2.2.x with the enhanced IDE patch) with DMA enabled by default.
And yes I have already tried switching the 80 pin cables 7 times.  Heck, I
even get CRC errors on UDMA33 drives using 40 pin cables; albeit a lesser
amount.  I have also noticed a hanging issue on a FIC VA-503+ board in which
the PC speaker can hang, in mid beep, along with the system for a short
while occasionally when the speaker issues a beep.  By the way, any ideas on
how I can help debug this particular problem?  There is no Ooops so I am not
sure how I can help out.  Both systems otherwise work very well and
perfectly on Win9x, Win2k, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.  I'm starting to take a
very dim view of Linux on VIA boards.
