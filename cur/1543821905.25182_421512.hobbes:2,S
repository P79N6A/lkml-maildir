Who cares who "enabled" the device.  Remember, the majority of PCI
devices in the system are not video ones.  Lots of other types of
devices want this ability to enable PCI devices from userspace.  I've
been talking with some people about how to properly write PCI drivers in
userspace, and this attribute is a needed part of it.
And if X gets enabling the device wrong, again, who cares, it's not a
kernel issue. :)
