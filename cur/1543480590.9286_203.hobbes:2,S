    I'm puzzled by the returned data of the 'readdir' call. The dirent
    structure has a d_reclen entry. If I run a small C program under 2.0.36
    which returns the d_reclen of the root directory entries I get:
    d_name '.' 
    d_reclen:12  strlen(d_name):1
    d_name '..' 
    d_reclen:16  strlen(d_name):2
    d_name 'lost+found' 
    d_reclen:24  strlen(d_name):10
Yes - so what do you see?
d_reclen is strlen(d_name)+11, rounded up to be divisible by 4.
    d_reclen is *very* different from the strlen of the entry. I would expect
    d_reclen to be equal to the strlen result. d_reclen seems to return the 
    number of bytes of allocation in the directory file, these are multiple
    of 4 . 32 bits INTS.
    In the GNU C_library in the function getcwd d_reclen (d_namelen) is used
    to build the pathname which sometimes give odd results e.g. somewhere in a
    mounted NCP or Samba tree.
    If one uses 'less' or 'vi' or '/bin/pwd' these programs complain that they
    are unable to find the current working directory.
Hmm. Why not read the man pages?
Let me see - man readdir: ... superseded by getdents(2) ... -
man getdents:
       The dirent structure is declared as follows:
              struct dirent
              {
                  long d_ino;                 /* inode number */
                  off_t d_off;                /* offset to next dirent */
                  unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this dirent */
                  char d_name [NAME_MAX+1];   /* file name (null-terminated) */
              }
This answers your question about the meaning of d_reclen.
(And you see the 4+4+2+namelen+1=11+namelen.)
Or, to be more precise, about the meaning of d_reclen as returned by the
getdents() system call.
What about glibc? You shouldnt want to know this: POSIX only knows about
d_name, so any use of any other field is nonportable (and indeed, various
C libraries have had different layouts and contents for a struct dirent),
but inspection of /usr/include/dirent*.h shows
struct dirent
  {
    long int d_ino;
    __off_t d_off;
    unsigned short int d_reclen;
    unsigned char d_type;
    char d_name[256];           /* We must not include limits.h! */
  };
Hmm - interesting, an additional field.
So, the dirent's of this glibc 2.0.7 are larger than the kernel's.
But your answers are identical to the kernel's.
So, your `GNU C-library' is not glibc 2.0.7 - probably older.
I am too lazy to investigate the history of struct dirent's in
various C libraries. If you continue to have problems, please
also give the glibc version you are using.
