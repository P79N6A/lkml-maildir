Maybe... I admit that I generalised from 2 examples: rt2500 and yenta.
However I don't think it makes a big difference to the problem with
shared interrupts (assuming my analysis is right).
The loop isn't really necessary if you are sure that unserviced
interrupts will be re-asserted (as level-triggered interrupts would
be) (though it may still help performance) and the loop isn't
sufficient if you need to be sure that all events get services (as
there may be more in the shared-chain).
Thanks,
