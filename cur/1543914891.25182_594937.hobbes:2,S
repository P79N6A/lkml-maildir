F7 was released before the vdso for x86_64 was upstream so you should
not expect anything else.  F8 will use the available vdso.  This
doesn't just happen magically, changes to libc are needed.

Unfortunately the vsyscalls cannot ever go completely away.
Statically linked apps, the bane of progress, will need them.  There
are also people updating kernels but not the user userland code.
What we will have to do in future is to make vsyscalls configurable.
Both a compile time option and a runtime option (perhaps also under
control of SELinux) are likely needed.
