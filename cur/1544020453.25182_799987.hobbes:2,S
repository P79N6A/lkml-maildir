Yes, but the compiler can read ->vfork_done twice, and turn this code
into
	cmplp = k->vfork_done;
	if (cmplp){
		kthread = container_of(k->vfork_done, struct kthread, exited);
		...
and when we read k->vfork_done again it can be already NULL.
Probably we could use ACCESS_ONCE() instead.
Perhaps this barrier() is not needed in practice, but just to be safe.
And in fact I saw the bug report with this code:
	ac.ac_tty = current->signal->tty ?
		old_encode_dev(tty_devnum(current->signal->tty)) : 0;
this code is wrong anyway, but ->tty was read twice. I specially
asked for .s file because I wasn't able to believe the bug manifests
itself this way.

Yes, in that case we don't need the barrier().
I was thinking about changing mm_release() too, but we should clear
->vfork_done (or whatever) in exec_mmap() anyway.
Oleg.
