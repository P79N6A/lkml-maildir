The locking still looks _very_ suspicious. The code seems to lock at all
the wrong places, leaving a lot of accesses completely outside any
locking. In particular, look at how the code in emu10k1_set_oss_vol()
(which was apparently the one involved in the irqhandler lockup) now does
not protect the mixer_state thing in _any_ way.
In general it is a bug to leave locking to the low-level routines, in this
case to "emu10k1_set_volume_gpr()". I realize that somebody went "Ugh, we
should try to make the locking regions as small as possible", but the fact
is, locks that are _too_ small are no better than no locks at all.
It may be that there is some good reason for why the mixer_state thing
doesn't need a lock - I only gave the patch a quick see-though, but if so
maybe a single line comment migth be appropriate.
