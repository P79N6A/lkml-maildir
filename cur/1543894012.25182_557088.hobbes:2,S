Last time i tried, it wasn't so much fun either. Mainly due to wild
cursor, that in normal text mode is well-behaved thing. Visually fb looks
much heavier. What's the benefit, if you see how windows in emacs are
painted? I don't know how giga-hertz/mem in cpu/sys-ram,
mega-hertz/ram in gpu are doing better job WRT to anything in visual
domain.
Also i don't know what to do in case of bugs/oops and "officially" closed
hardware specs on ATI chips{ref}.
About laptop. First and last time i ran new X11 (X.org) there, it drove
VGA fan really crazy. Don't know how it changed now, it was certainly due
to blindly switching 3D on. I don't want to remove *standard* drivers
because of that stupidness [see ref].
And after whole year being with Debian Sarge only, new application update
led me to just drop all that X stuff and run windoze (silently sold to me
with that laptop) if i need a stupid web browser with all that WEB 2.0
and Java crap...
