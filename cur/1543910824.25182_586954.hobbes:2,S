Yeah, I remember having done so : moving the preempt disable nearer to
the cmpxchg, checking if the cpuid has changed between the
raw_smp_processor_id() read and the preempt_disable done later, redo if
it is different. It makes the slow path faster, but makes the fast path
more complex, therefore I finally dropped the patch. And we talk about
~10 cycles for the slow path here, I doubt it's worth the complexity
added to the fast path.
