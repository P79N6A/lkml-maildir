Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi All,
The patch is getting quite small now. Only a handful of
things outstanding, and a couple of new things to go in.
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/linux-2.5.47-uc0.patch.gz
Change log:
1. patch up to 2.5.47                (me)
2. cleanup of kernel/fork.c          (Christoph Hellwig)
3. merge m68knommu entry.S           (me)
4. merge coldfire vector code        (me)
5. v850 tweaks                       (Miles Bader)
I haven't bothered with subsection patches this time, I don't
think they are any help now. I will break this up into small
patches and send to Linus...
Regards
Greg
