And who is going to take it away from you? I'm actively using ML. Yes, I
need it to get the real work done. It doesn't make it a necessary part of
minimal setup. I need quite a few very specific libraries (mostly my own)
to work with algebraic curves. Also not a part of minimal system, IMHO.
Please, get real. Nobody says about throwing X away. Guy asked about the
basic subset of system. Certainly one may (and mostly likely does) need
*some* applications (for varying values of some) in addition to that. E.g.
X and stuff running atop of it. So? Nobody sane is going to discuss it.
