Suggestion: ctrl-alt-del should be a working command
earlier in the bootup process, so that reboots won't
take so long because we have to wait. For example, I
sometimes have to change something in BIOS and then
must reboot, which means I have to go almost to the
login stage before I can warm-reboot.
I now use Fedora Core 4, with kernel
2.6.11-1.1369_FC4.
I don't have the time to do much more than suggest,
e.g., learn C and assembler -- I wish I did. And maybe
earlier ctrl-alt-del would raise too many conflicts or
can't be done. I don't know.
Thanx.
