I'm not convinced:
The wakeup happens at irq time. The band info is necessary for 
send_sigio(). Calling f_poll at irq time is not an option - it will 
definitively cause breakage. schedule_work() for every call is IMHO not 
an option. And even that is not reliable: fasync users might expect 
seperate POLL_OUT and POLL_IN signals.
