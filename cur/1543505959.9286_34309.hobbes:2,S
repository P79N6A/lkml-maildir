This may be completely wrong, but I have found lately that turning off tcp
timestamps:
echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps
improves throughput on quite a few links (www.meldrum.co.uk being one of
them). I don't know why.
Using HiSax ISDN here (still stalling on large outgoing files after a few
hours uptime, rmmod and insmod-ing the entire isdn module set fixes the
problem temporarily).
