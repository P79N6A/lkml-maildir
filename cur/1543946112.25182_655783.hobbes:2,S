 Subject: [PATCH] Be more robust about bad arguments in get_user_pages()
 MAINLINE: 900cf086fd2fbad07f72f4575449e0d0958f860f
 So I spent a while pounding my head against my monitor trying to figure
 out the vmsplice() vulnerability - how could a failure to check for
 *read* access turn into a root exploit? It turns out that it's a buffer
 overflow problem which is made easy by the way get_user_pages() is
 coded.
 In particular, "len" is a signed int, and it is only checked at the
 *end* of a do {} while() loop.  So, if it is passed in as zero, the loop
 will execute once and decrement len to -1.  At that point, the loop will
 proceed until the next invalid address is found; in the process, it will
 likely overflow the pages array passed in to get_user_pages().
 
 I think that, if get_user_pages() has been asked to grab zero pages,
 that's what it should do.  Thus this patch; it is, among other things,
 enough to block the (already fixed) root exploit and any others which
 might be lurking in similar code.  I also think that the number of pages
 should be unsigned, but changing the prototype of this function probably
 requires some more careful review.
