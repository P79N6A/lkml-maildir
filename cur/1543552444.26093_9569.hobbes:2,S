Just a quick follow-up on l-k since Linus has been helping me debug this
and I keep forgetting to CC l-k with the results. Sorry.
It appears as if the pci irq routing code is broken for the 1533 (at
least on my machine). The 'fix' so far (pending documentation for the
1533 appearing .. if you have a copy, please yell), is to comment out 
the line in arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c that contains the entry for ALI 
in pirq_routers[] - on my machine it uses the 'default' router then
and it works.
If anyone else is seeing boot problems with test10pre4 and up with a
ALI M1533 chipset, please try this and post the result to the list.
Thank you,
