I think I'm starting to understand. Looking back at the url you gave,
it appears your device is some kind of articulated arm, possibly with
one or more motor(s) at each joint. You are not really dealing with a
single torque applied at one point in space, but several torques
applied at several points in space.
For this particular device you have three values, but for other
devices it could just as well be any other number, right?
A realistic example would be a robot arm with claws, there would be a
torque for each joint, and some more for the claws.
