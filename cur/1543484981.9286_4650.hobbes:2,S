What are \c for ? 
Basically you have to send +++ (open a minicom window and type it (with
pauses) to check). And of course you should not have any other program
sending characters in between. If all you want is to simply close the ppp
link you should just kill the pppd daemon - it will close the line itself.
(pppd daemon has a pppd.pid file someplace in /var)
