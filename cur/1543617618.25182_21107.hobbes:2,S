 *nod*, though you can almost guarantee this isn't what Eric wants.
 I'm assuming he wants something a'la /proc/pci
 Hacking the EISA code to register a driver in driverfs should be
 fairly trivial. I'll wait and see what Pat does with the
 busdriver reworking that he's up to right now before doing anything
 on this though.
