Subject: Re: ldt allocation failed
Okay,
I have found another failure path leading to the failure message:
vmalloc -> vmalloc_area_pages -> alloc_area_pmd -> pte_alloc
This pte_alloc temporarily releases a spinlock on the mm_pagetable. If 
at the same time another processor handles a vmalloc too, a race 
condition can surface. A check is done for this to happen. In that case 
a NULL allocation will be returned through the same path. This triggers 
the message.
This is a kernel bug as a more decent failure mechanism should be in 
place. Something like a retry to allocate a page table entery.
Does this make sense?
Please forward this message to the kernel list, I am not on the list 
and can't reply to the thread. 
Hope it helps,
Ludo Stellingwerff
