yeah. To a smaller degree it would be dependent on generic system-load 
too. E.g. if some code keeps interrupts disabled for too long. But the 
main delay potential is from other interrupts, or from having too many 
timers to process.

doh, it was too early in the morning. Of course xtime is driven by 
interrupts just as much, so time updates are already 'asynchronous' and 
subject to interrupt delays. So your idea is perfectly fine.
