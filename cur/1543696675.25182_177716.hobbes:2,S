For 2.2 I kept changelogs and errata patches for any big problem. For
-ac its always been a bit simpler because -ac1 is in part 2.4.20-post1
so I had an unfair advantage over people. The other thing -ac did was a
new patch every 2-3 days. The more you get out the more feedback you get
back and the faster you take fixes (even small ones) the more
committment you get from other people in my experience.
