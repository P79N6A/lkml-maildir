Subject: bug in kernel 2.6.21-rc1-git1: conventional floppy drive cannot be mounted without hanging up the whole system

Hi folks,
Second attempt now:
I already reported to Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton that it is impossible to mount a conventional floppy drive without hanging up the whole system.
Andrew's reaction was quite ambiguous: "We did not break it"
Once again and for the last time: I do not state that floppy.c is broken. I only state that it is immpossible to mount a floppy drive with kernel 2.6.21-rc1-git1. Kernel 2.6.20 is OK. But 2.6.21-rc1-git1 is definitely buggy!
I did some work already:
a. I copied the following modules from the intact and sane kernel 2.6.20 into the 2.6.21-rc1-git1 tree:
cdrom.h, floppy.c, init.h, io.h, proc_misc.c, setup.c, timer.h, uaccess.h
b. I adjusted some hunks of the patch for module main.c (part of patch-2.6.21-rc1) to make the kernel compile without errors.
But the problem still persists, and I do not have any idea anymore where the offensive hunks in patch-2.6.21-rc1 could reside.
Questions:
a. Can someone please confirm the described problem?
b. Can someone please take action to find out where the buggy code resides?
c. Why is this untested material being pushed into main vanilla - what is going on at kernel.org please?
Please take action! The bug was introduced somewhere at the transition of 2.6.20 towards 2.6.20-git14.
Yours sincerely
Uwe
P. S.: I once again repeat my proposal: Every patch code should be tested before it is being pushed into main vanilla.
The testing tree is the mm-tree.
If this policy producing regressions persists noone takes advantage of! So please avoid those regressions in future!
If this rule "test your changes, however small, on at least 4 or 5 people" does not apply to absolutely everybody then it is worth nothing!
My platform is i386, Intel ICH4 and I am using floppy.c (Normal floppy disk support).
