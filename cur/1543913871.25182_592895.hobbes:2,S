I agree that doing things only half is semi-regularly worse than doing them 
not at all, and this specific case might be the worst example of all, as I 
read that using sys_open/read is actively harmful, so, well...
I read the thread since I tend to keep lots of external crap around. Not in 
any way that would mean I'd have any grounds for complaining about anything; 
mostly just driver stuff in various states of completeness that I never seem 
to get around to cleaning up enough to submit to anyone.
But as such, I can comment on the fact that I'm much more likely to notice 
the warning than I am to notice a thread on LKML, say. How much more likely 
I'd be to then also actually do anything about it before it just breaks 
anyway is another matter, but again, well...

In this case I believe it makes sense to just rip it out, but generally it 
doesn't need to be such a fully robotic yes/no decision, I'd say.
