What you want is ext3.
It is a journaling version of ext2, which basically
means you get all the advantages of soft updates and
a bit more (due to the atomicity that journaled
transactions can give you).
It should be superior to softupdates in both the
consistency area and the performance area (due to
the fact that stuff is in the journal, you have
more freedom to reorder the writes to the "main"
part of the filesystem).

Rik
