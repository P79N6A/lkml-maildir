You know this problem was "solved" over 20 years ago when it was
discovered that file-names could never be long enough. The solution
was a container-file which contained as much stuff as necessary to
identity the contents of the file that it was associated with. Using
this technique, the "real" file didn't need any ASCII identifiers. The
real file didn't show up in some directory program, just the contents
of the container-file. This same technique could be used for any
arbitrary file-identification including characters that haven't been
invented yet.
