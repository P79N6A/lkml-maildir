Subject: [PATCH 10/51] [GFS2] Detach buf data during in-place writeback
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Bob Peterson <rpeterso@redhat.com>
This is patch 5 of 5 for bug #248176
Metadata corruption was occurring because page references weren't
being removed in all cases.  I previously added a function called
detach_bufdata, but I discovered there already WAS a function out
there to do the job.  It's called gfs2_meta_cache_flush.  So I added
a call to that to remove the page references.
