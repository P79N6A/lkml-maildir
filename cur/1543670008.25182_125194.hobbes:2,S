True, but then, most things expect a version with two '.' s.
And adding the extra '.2' breaks how they calculate the version.
Mozilla for example, strip off all non numbers and '.' s, and
then just cut the last '.' and number.  What ever is left, is
used to check what makefile should be used in the NSS stuff ...
Meaning, with a normal version, it would be:
 Makefile-2.4
With Jörn's, it would try to use:
 Makefile-2.4.20
which do not exits ...
Yes, mozilla is broken ;)  I never said you cannot set
EXTRAVERSION to '.2'.  All I said, was that its going
to break stuff, as many things expect, and only work
with a two '.' version ....
