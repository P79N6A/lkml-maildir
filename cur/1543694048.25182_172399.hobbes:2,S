> Don't ask me why???  Triple question marks are a C trigraph in ansi C.
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[1]'ISO/IEC 9899:1999  Programming languages  --  C' says in §5.2.1.1 that
C trigraph sequences are:
??=     #         ??)     ]         ??!     |
??(     [         ??'     ^         ??>     }
??/     \         ??<     {         ??-     ~
"No  other  trigraph  sequences exist", I didn't look [2] 'Corrigendum 1,
ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor 1:2001', but I think that they were not modified.
And inside of comments there are not trigraph substitutions, at least
in theory §6.4.9.
I only found a few in 2.4.22-bk30, aka 2.4.23-pre7:
