While Ingo is busy working 48 hours a day on the new mutex
info-structure, the -rt patch set has been a little slow at getting
patch releases.  So I've started up a little patch fix repository for
the -rt patch set until Ingo has time to get back to this again.
If you have a problem with the -rt patch set, please CC Ingo and myself,
and I'll try to fix the problem and post a patch here.
My updates will be named -sr, so the current release is at
2.6.15-rt1-sr1.  Note, this is more like the stable branch, I'm only
updating bug fixes here.  Although this is not as strict as the stable
branch, my adding a patch will be based mainly on how critical it is.
This release contains:
- latest rtc fix (Steven Rostedt)
- ipv6 mcast rwlock initialization fix (Daniel Walker)
