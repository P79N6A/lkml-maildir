Thanks for the patch. Patch accepted and committed to my tree. It will be 
submitted with the next ntfs point release. I don't feel like this is 
enough for a release so I will wait to gather some more things before 
submitting so it may be a week or two, hope you don't mind the delay... If 
nothing comes up, I will just submit it on its own.
Note almost none of it applied because it was against 2.5.30 vanilla and 
ntfs has evolved two point releases since then and in fact some of your 
deltas were already there because mft_count has been eliminated. (-: But I 
did the changes by hand so no worries...

You are welcome. Thanks for your contribution. (-:
Best regards,
