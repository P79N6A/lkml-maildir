That's exactly what IA64 does. The generic kernel works for all IA64
architectures. If you build an architecture specific IA64 kernel (such
as IA64_DIG), IA64 uses ifdef and macro magics for dma mapping
operations.
The ifdef and macro magics makes the code unreadable. I rewrote IA64
dma operation code to use the standard way to handle multiple dma
mapping operation sets so that non everyone can understand the code
easily.
