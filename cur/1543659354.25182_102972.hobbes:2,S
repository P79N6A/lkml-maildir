Because, when they are used, they are ORed into word-sized registers.
The track and sector are are put into register CX and the head and drive
number are put into DX.

On page 218, "System BIOS for IBM PC/XT/AT Computers", Phoenix
Technical Reference Series, ISBN 0-201-51806-6, the documentation
clearly states that BL contains the foreground color and BH the
active page. Therefore 0x0007 is the correct value to be put
into that register for the "Write Teletype to Active Page" function.
FYI, the startup functions are used once-per-boot. Any "improvements"
other than those necessary to "fix" something are useless in the
overall scheme of things.
