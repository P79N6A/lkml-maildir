First of all, you should include your patches inline. That way one can
easily comment on them. I only quickly glanced at it, and I am not sure
about why you need the additional list_ macros. Also, several of your macros
do something like this:
+#define hidinput_simple_driver_setup_usage(hid) \
+do {\
+       if (hid->simple) {\
+               hid->simple->flags |= HIDINPUT_SIMPLE_SETUP_USAGE; \
+               hidinput_simple_driver_configure_usage(hid); \
+       }\
+} while (0)
You should use (hid) instead of hid. Because of how the pre-processor works.
