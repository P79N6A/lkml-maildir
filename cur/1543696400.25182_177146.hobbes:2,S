And this is why you always leave at least one "known working" kernel in your
lilo.conf or grub.conf (I think I've got at least 4 kernels listed right now
that are known to boot and be at least stable enough to build a kernel).  Also
good for recovering from broken framebuffer drivers, kernels that hang at boot
before getting very far, and all sorts of other messes.
