I added the break-latency-in-invalidate_list.patch to the SLES9 kernel.
I am running the test again, but do not see how that change can do anything
to eliminate the race condition which appears to leave me with a NULL
pointer.  I will dig into that more today if other obligations allow it.

I guess I am very concerned at this point.  If I can do a
release/reacquire, why not just change generic_shutdown_super() so the
lock_kernel() does not happen until the first pass has occurred.  ie:

This at least makes the lock_kernel time much smaller than it is right
now.  It also does not affect any callers that may really need the BKL.
I guess I am really asking for an indication of what the BKL is supposed
to be protecting.  I have not dug for the intent down the VFS code paths
at all.
