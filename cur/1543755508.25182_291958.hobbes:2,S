Hi,
I don't like calling crash_kexec() directly in (ex.) panic().
It should be call_dump_hook() (or something like this).
I think the necessary modifications of the kernel is only:
- insert the hooks that calls a dump function when crash occur
- binding interface that binds a dump function to the hook
  (like register_dump_hook())
- supply the information of valid physical address regions
(- maybe some existent functions and variables need to be exported ?)
I think this makes any sort of dump functions can be implemented
as a kernel module. I don't think it is best way that the "kexec based 
crashdump" is built in the kernel.
Thanks.
