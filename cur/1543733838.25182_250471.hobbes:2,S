Hi there,
We are developing embedded Linux system. Performance is our consideration.
We hope some applications can run as fast as possible,
and are think if they can be put in a filesystem image, which resides in
RAM, and run in XIP (eXecute In Place)  manners.
I know that Cramfs has supported Application XIP. Is there any other FS that
also supports it? Ramdisk? Ramfs? Romfs?
Thanks and regards,
Colin
