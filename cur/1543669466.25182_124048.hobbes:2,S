Adding more syscalls isn't really a big deal - whether you add one or
a bunch of them in a diff doesn't really matter.

Which is a good thing :)  Having syscall multiplexers leads to very
messy APIs like the one you proposed :)

We have a reboot notifier call chain in the kernel.

You have this no shared fs argument a few times - why don't you _add_
a shared virtual filesystem for kerne, information?  This would clean
up many of the messier APIs.

Okay, you're right - this should be a syscall.

Yeah, conviencded.  Care to submit a separated out vmadump aptch with
the syscalls for 2.5?

I don't think you really want a device for this.  It's more an attribute
of the mapping, so a MAP_ALWAYS_LOCAL flag to mmap sounds like the right
thing.
