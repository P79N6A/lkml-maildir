I didn't see anything like that for ide disks. What I did notice is that my eth
devices (on different busses) had new names sometime back in 2.5.x time. I wrote
that off to differences in walking/probing of the PCI tree giving different
enumeration of the devices. Possibly the same would hold true for the ide if
there are multiple ide interfaces on the system.
As I recall, there's also a kernel param for "Boot off-board chipsets first
support". Maybe that bit got flipped inadvertently???
