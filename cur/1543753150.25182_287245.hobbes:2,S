Paul noticed that too so I came up with the patch below.
If it makes sense I can do the other architectures (I'm not sure == 0
is correct everywhere).  This is pretty much what I'm using now
without problems (it's either correct or it's almost correct and the
rwlock_is_write_locked hasn't thus far stuffed anything this boot).

Fix how we check for read and write rwlock_t locks.
