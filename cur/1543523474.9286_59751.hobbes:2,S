flushb the blockdevice before accessing it the second time, if you share
the same big blackbox masqueraded as a scsi disk across multiple scsi
adapters.
Doing the flush on umount won't help you if you for example did an fsck
before start using the disk on another SCSI controller (potentially in
another machine).

If you need to access the device only from some specific application you
probably want to use rawio and alloc the cache in userspace memory and
handle cache coherency via tcp, each time you write a block you should
invalidate such block in all the user-caches of all other clients. That
could be handled cleanly with a LGPL library.
Use Stephen's rawio (with some recent fixes from me) that I included into
2.2.14aa2 if you need rawio in 2.2.x:
