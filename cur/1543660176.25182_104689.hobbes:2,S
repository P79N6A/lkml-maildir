Hi,
This night, while half a-sleep I thought it is usefull to have a tool
which creates a number of files in a directory and then starts to randomly
rename them. During this, it should output how much it has done and how
many renames per second it did.
5 minutes back I programmed such a program, you can download it from:
http://www.vanheusden.com/Linux/rename_test-1.0.tgz
But now, fully awake with at least 8 cups of coffee in my system I cannot
think of anything usefull this program is actually doing.
Well, maybe to test if something gets corrupted allong the way?
Oh well.
