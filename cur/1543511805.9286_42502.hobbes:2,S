You use accept() with a connection. UDP is connectionless. There is
no connection. The server just sends UDP datagrams (hoping they get
there), using sendto(), and the proposed listener uses recvfrom(), 
collecting as many messages as don't get lost.
If you want a connection, you use a stream socket, not UDP. With this,
the server posts an accept() waiting for a connection which occurs
when the client issues a connect(). After that, either party uses
send() or write(), to send data; and recv() or read(); to receive data.
Data sent/received on a connection is guaranteed to be perfect, but
the time it takes to get there is not guaranteed.
Data sent/received on UDP is not guaranteed to get out of your computer,
although it usually does and, in fact may in some instances, be more
efficient (satellite communication). The 'user' of UDP has to replace
missing data in the user program.
