As pointed out elsewhere, modules is not the only way to load kernel 
code live. Modules is just a cleaner interface for it. Rootkits capable 
of loading their kernel code without involving the module system has 
existed for ages.

Don't hold your breath - code can be inserted without involving actual 
files. It just makes things less persistent.
