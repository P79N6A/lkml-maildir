The IR interface isn't a board. It's a HSDL3612 with 2 capacitors and one
resistor soldered in a box according to the recommended wiring from datasheet,
so technically, it's not a board, but an airwire construction ;-)
However it is not sending breaks, but rather various characters. As the kernel
seems to be set internally for echo cahracters going into the computer on the
transmit line again, and the characters are echoed by the infrared receiver
during transmission too, a character stream cycles infinitely there.
However kernel shouldn't hang even if you wired the serial input to an alien
spacecraft.
