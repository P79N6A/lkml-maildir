Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] soft lockup detected in databuf_lo_before_commit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/14/114

From: Bob Peterson <rpeterso@redhat.com>
This is part 2 of the patch for bug #245832, part 1 of which is already
in the git tree.
The problem was that sdp->sd_log_num_databuf was not always being
protected by the gfs2_log_lock spinlock, but the sd_log_le_databuf
(which it is supposed to reflect) was protected.  That meant there
was a timing window during which gfs2_log_flush called
databuf_lo_before_commit and the count didn't match what was
really on the linked list in that window.  So when it ran out of
items on the linked list, it decremented total_dbuf from 0 to -1 and
thus never left the "while(total_dbuf)" loop.
The solution is to protect the variable sdp->sd_log_num_databuf so
that the value will always match the contents of the linked list,
and therefore the number will never go negative, and therefore, the
loop will be exited properly.
