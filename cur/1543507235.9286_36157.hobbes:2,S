I know that the Adaptec 'AAA' series of raid controllers is not, and will
not be supported by Linux, but does anyone know if the 'AAC' series
(specifically the AAC-364) will be, or is ?
Dell used to ship their PowerEdge systems with the AMI MegaRaid controller
which is supported, but now they have dropped that controller (which was
only a dual channel card) for the new adaptec cards which are quad channel.
Thanks,
Terry
