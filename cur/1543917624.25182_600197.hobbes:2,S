I have seen that twice with v20.5 under 2.6.22.7/.8. Didn't see it yet with
v22.  xterm would get pissed if I tried to "secure keyboard", so something
stole the keyboard focus and wouldn't give it back to xorg.  Maybe a locking
bug in xorg somewhere?
Anyway, my kernel is NOT tainted, so rest assured that at least this one is
not nVidia's fault.
BTW, v20.5 in 2.6.21.7 would sometimes cause dmcrypt to oops when first
mounting a LUKS volume if there was some non-extra-light disk activity going
on.  Probably something missing in the backport to 2.6.21...
Sorry, days down here have been very busy, so I didn't have time to send a
proper bug report.
