There are all compiled with gcc instead of g++, are you sure that will ok
with all supported gcc versions?

Here I thought about using "ifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),...)" to keep them in a
single file. Did you try something like this?

This works quite well for users, but it's very annoying for the developer.
Kai, any chances to use md5sum for this at some point, e.g. with a helper
script like this:
set -e
src=$1
dst=$2
shift 2
test -f $dst && tail -1 $dst | sed 's,/\* \(.*\) \*/,\1,' | md5sum -c && touch $dst && exit 0
echo "$@"
"$@"
echo "/* $(md5sum $src) */" >> $dst
The only problem with this script is that it only supports a single input
and output file.
Something else I'd like to have for later is the ability to compile
$(sharedobjs) as a shared library and install it somewhere so it can be
used by external programs.
bye, Roman
