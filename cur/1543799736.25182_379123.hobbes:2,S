this is normal and a result of the linux permission model.
(and fwiw you don't get to edit the file, only to create a new file. You
may think that's exactly the same.. but it's not in the light of
hardlinks)
Btw there is a "sticky bit" you can set on the directory which changes this behavior,
for example /tmp has this set for obvious reasons

I suspect the SUS standard fully specifies the 4 rules I mentioned and
the sticky-exception (and the rest is an obvious result)
