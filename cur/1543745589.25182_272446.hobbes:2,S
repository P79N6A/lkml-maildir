hmm I can't see what could be majorly different between 2.6.9-mm1 and
2.6.10-rc2-mm2 with the DRM apart from core/personality split and that
shouldn't affect the IRQ code I've just  reviewed it another time but
can see nothing in this area,
Can you try on 2.6.10-rc2-mm2 from runlevel 3
modprobe drm
echo 1 > /sys/module/drm/parameters/debug
modprobe radeon
and get the dmesg it should be a lot more verbose.. does the IRQ die
at this point? if not start X running and send me the X startup log
from /var/log and the dmesg..
Thanks,
Dave.
