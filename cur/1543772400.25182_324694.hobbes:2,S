Indeed, I've just managed to reproduce the full test with two different
addresses as it's described in p30. I never succeeded to do it before,
perhaps I did not try it the right way. To achieve this, I had to run two
programs doing while(connect()<0). I agree that on high latency networks,
it may make sense to support the feature (eg: mars-earth file transfers).
But on regular uses, I think it's more a problem than a feature, because
it allows any third party to prevent a normal connection establishment
by only knowing the source and destination, which are sometimes easily
guessable (eg: BGP between routers) :
  | A connects to B, C tries to block them by sending lots of SYN at
  | intervals smaller than the latency between A and B, eg 200/s for
  | a 10 ms latency.
  A                                       B (or C)
  ---------------+--------------------------------
                  <- SYN(SEQ=200)         (C sends blind SYN)
                  <- SYN(SEQ=200)         (C sends blind SYN)
  SYN(SEQ=100) -> ...
                  <- SYN(SEQ=200)         (C sends blind SYN)
  SYN(SEQ=101,ACK=201) ->                 (A acknowledges C's SYN)
                  <- SYN(SEQ=300,ACK=101) (B acknowledges A's SYN)
  RST(SEQ=102,ACK=301) ->                 (A rejects B's SYN/ACK)
                  <- RST(SEQ=201,ACK=102) (B rejects A's SYN/ACK)
Maybe it would be useful to have a sysctl option allowing us to disable
this behaviour when it can haev security implications ?
Also, I often test firewalls for such features and never found any one
which allows this. To be more precise, only a previous implementation of
the tcp-window-tracking in Netfilter allowed this but it opened a security
breach that we had to resolve with Jozsef, as it allowed the client to
establish a session by sending the SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK itself...

It does not depend on my definition, but on my knowledge, as I put the
condition in the initial mail that you quoted above :-)
Cheers,
