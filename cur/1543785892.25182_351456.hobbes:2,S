OK, so the bonding devices which were registered are now in state
NETREG_REGISTERING and we need to run netdev_run_todo() to flip them into
state NETREG_REGISTERED.  If we don't do that,
bond_free_all()->unregister_netdevice() will go BUG.
The fix is solid enough, although a better comment is needed.  Let's let
Dave decide whether that was a sane thing to go BUG over..

bond_init() is not releasing rtnl_sem after register_netdevice() and before
calling unregister_netdevice() (from bond_free_all()) in the exception
path.  As the device registration is not completed (dev->reg_state ==
NETREG_REGISTERING), the call to unregister_netdevice() triggers
BUG_ON(dev->reg_state != NETREG_REGISTERED).
