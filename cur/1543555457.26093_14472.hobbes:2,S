These numbers should NOT get looked up - if they are, then very
useful information will be lost; they are not only references to
kernel functions, but also kernel data and read only data within
the kernel text segment.  The result will be a totally undeciperal
garbage.
Again, care to put the effort into klogd/ksymoops to handle the
architecture special cases?
