The only issue is how much do you bump the enthrophy counter.  If you
bump it 0 everytime, you could enter constant data without problems
(in fact, some sources bump 0 because we can't *guarantee* that they
have more enthropy than that.)  If you bump it more than that, you are
making the promise that *at least* that much enthropy was injected in
the pool.
