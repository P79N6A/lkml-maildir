	Hello Robert,  I tried an grunt experiment .  I put Two Ross
	HyperSparc Dual 66Mhz cpu's in my sparc20 chassis & attempted
	to install RH-6.1 on the system .  After several lock ups ,
	and just plain funky behaviour (ie: key presses mis-interpreted) .
	I opened the case and removed the cpu's emmediately after power
	off , they were almost to hot to handle as a rough guess approx.
	125 Deg. F.  Now in my book this is way to hot for a cpu to be
	and would definately cause the flaky behaviour I (& maybe you)
	were seeing .  I will later attempt to add some additional fans 
	to the case & see if the added airflow helps .  
	When I popped these out I dropped back in an old set of Ross
	40Mhz Dual cpu's & started the process over , So far nothing
	ill has happened .	Hth,  JimL
