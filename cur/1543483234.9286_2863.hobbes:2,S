Proofs, please 8)
Kernel knows better what interface routes to install by definition
of interface routes. If kernel installs not the things, which you
consider correct, it means that your configuration was invalid.
Pair interface prefix + interface route is ONE object.
Attempt to create prefix, but not route, is just non-sense,
it means that you have no reasons to create this prefix:
kernel will ignore it.
