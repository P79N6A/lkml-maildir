following BUG() is started when coda is included into kernel. I have not
tried module, but i bet it will couse the same error.
coda_init_inodecache runs kmem_cache_create which couses oups.
Removing following lines from slab.c renders system stable.
But this is not a cure. As i am not using coda it self, i really don't
know if it is running stable.
slab.c snip:
        /*
         * Always checks flags, a caller might be expecting debug
         * support which isn't available.
         */
         /*
        if (flags & ~CREATE_MASK){
                        printk("dupa2\n");
                        _BUG();
                BUG();
        }
this is in kmem_cache_create fn.
