George, 
Is it worth/necessary to fix this bug in v2.4 ?
Quoting yourself
"This is an issue for debugging also (same ptrace...). The fix is to fix
nano_sleep to match the standard which says it should only return on a

"do nothing" signals). Signal in the kernel returns 1 if it calls the
task and 0 otherwise, thus nano sleep might be changed as follows: "
