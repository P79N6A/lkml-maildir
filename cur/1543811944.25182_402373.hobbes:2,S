Thank you Hugh for the reply. Last time I used VM_SHM was in 2.2.x kernels. 
I have a programme called DIPC which makes System V shared memory segments 
(and also messages and semaphores) work over a network.
In the arch/xyz/mm/fault.c file, it checks the VM_SHM flag and then calls 
its logic. As a substitute I've been trying this ad-hoc code to see if a vma 
represents a Sys V shm:
      file = vma->vm_file;
      if(file && (file->f_dentry) && (file->f_dentry->d_inode) &&
         (id = file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_ino)) {
              shp = shm_lock(id);
              if(shp == NULL)
                      return 0; // not a Sys V shm
      }
      else return 0; // not a Sys V shm
But the kernel hangs with an invalid-pointer error message. Any suggestions?
