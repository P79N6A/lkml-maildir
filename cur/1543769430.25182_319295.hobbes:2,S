For Jakob,
Note that the last OOPS I posted was for 2.6.11.10.
For Joshua,
We first saw the problem after 5 days in production, but since then
we took the server out of production and used the script
nfs_fsstress.sh located in this package:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ltp/ltp-full-20050505.tgz?download
We run the script on 5 client machines that are running RedHat 9
with kernel-smp-2.4.20-20.9 and nfs-utils-1.0.1-3.9.1.legacy and
are NFS mounting our 2.6 kernel server.  The longest time to OOPS
has been about 8 hours.  We have not tried the parallel IOR
benchmark.  (Where can we get that?)
You didn't mention if you are using md at all.  We have a
software RAID-0 of 4 x 3ware 8506-4 controllers running the
latest 3ware driver from their site.  The filesystem is XFS.
The network driver is e1000 (two interfaces, not bonded).  The
system is a dual Xeon.  We upped the number of NFS daemons
from 8 to 64.  The nfs_fsstress.sh client mounts the servers
both UDP and TCP, and our in-production oops likely happened
with a combination of both protocols in use simultaneously as
well.  We've seen the OOPS with both the default and with 32K
read and write NFS block sizes.  The machine was stable for
over a year with RedHat 9 and 2.4.20.
I'm grasping for any subtle details that might help...
Here is our list of loaded modules:
