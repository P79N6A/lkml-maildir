True, we shouldn't announce this particular little secret to the whole wide 
world, but I think it's alright to tell the people on this list about it. ;) 
After all, the only thing that could happen is that more kernel hackers 
decide to move here... and getting more smart neighbors like them, as a 
result, is never a bad thing!
So does this mean that you live in the Pacific Northwest in general, or 
Seattle in particular? If so, I never knew. And speaking of, who else haunts 
this little corner of the world? David Miller is moving here, unless my mind 
is playing tricks on me; anybody else?
