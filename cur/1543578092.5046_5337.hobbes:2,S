Can't the following be fixed properly?

Guess what happens here?
    return flags;

The above doesn't work on some architectures.  Its better to use a macro
if you want to separate this out.  ie, something like (davem will have to
okay it tho):
#define DvcEnterCritical()				\
 ({ unsigned long __flags; save_flags(__flags); cli(); __flags; })
#define DvcLeaveCritical(flags)				\
 do { restore_flags(flags); } while (0)
This should then ensure that you don't end up with problems associated
with register windows on the sparc or whatever.  Even better would be
to use a spinlock instead of Dvc?????Critical.
