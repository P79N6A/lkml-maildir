Ingo,  This original thread was regarding Linux vs. NetWare 5.x performance
metrics and responses from Linux folks about how to affect and 
improve them, not a diatribe on the features of TUX.  
I wrote the kernel in NetWare 4.x that later became 5.x.  To date, my
NOS kernel has grossed over 8 billion dollars.  This is more money 
than all the Linux companies have made combined in their entire 
history, on your work, Linus's work and everyone else's.  I don't have 
anything to prove to myself, or anyone else, which is why I do as I 
please in life, and no one's comments or snipes dissuade me from moving
forward.  I also am not "someone's employee".  
If you have some ideas on how to improve file and print or help me
get a linux incarnation that can stomp NetWare, I'd love to hear
your ideas.  I think TUX is great, BTW.  Otherwise, end-of-line...
:-)
