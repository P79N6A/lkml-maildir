Gulp, you should really be using a more recent copy of that driver. I'm 
running 1.91 from the CVS and I remember having had problems with the 
1.80 driver series too. I don't know why the ieee1394 tree is not pushed 
into the mainline kernel ...
Download the subversion client [1] and then follow the rest of the 
procedure on that page. Could you try and checkout the newest tree and 
simply replace the ieee1394 tree with the CVS one. You should probably 
also switch to a more recent 2.4.x tree since IIRC the .19 series has 
some changes to the scsi (emulation) subsystem.

Could you try with the latest 2.4.19preX tree and also replace the 
../drivers/ieee1394 with the CVS one?

Best regards,

p.s.: You have to hurry up, since I'm not online very often the next few 
weeks. Of course you could also show up at OLS with the disk ;).
