Looking back at an old version of the code, the original coder had the
kernel trap if dtDelete failed.  It really would be a rare case for
dtDelete to fail here.  I had changed the trap to the txAbort call to
make the unlikely failure a little more friendly.  I recognized that
everything wouldn't be completely consistent, so I had txAbort mark the
superblock dirty, which will force a complete fsck run before the volume
can be mounted again.
I can probably improve on this and leave the system in better
condition.  I'll treat this as a low priority bug.
Thanks for your work auditing the code and reporting the problem.
