I've also experianced this with 2.4.13+preempt. As ben said, playing single large files

get popping noises.
I'll give the cvs version a try and report back.

Software is something like a machine, and something like mathematics, and something like
language, and something like thought, and art, and information.... but software is not in
fact any of those other things.
