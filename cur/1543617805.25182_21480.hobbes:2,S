  Hi,
      I'm no kernel hacker so I am little hesitant to speak; however,
  I'm looking at kdev_t.h from the linux-2.5.3-pre1 source.
  The type of kdev_t has changed recently from a scalar type to a
  structured type.  Should macro definitions such as MINOR(dev) also
  be revised to be consistent with the "new" kdev_t ?
  Something like:
  #define MINOR(dev)  ((unsigned int) ((dev.value) & MINORMASK))
  rather than
  #define MINOR(dev)  ((unsigned int) ((dev) & MINORMASK))
  Then usage of the MINOR() macro remains unchanged. 
  Regards,
          Roger Brown
