For what case? In the case where DOSEMU (running actual DOS, remember) is
reading from FAT, it's expecting CRLF already. In the case where it's
reading from imported ext2, the capability has never been there.

The problem with this is that it can never be done in a reliable fashion
as binary/text is indicated by very loose convention of file naming. One
of the following will give unexpected results:
cp foo.exe foo.tmp
md5sum foo.exe foo.tmp
cp foo.txt foo.tmp
md5sum foo.txt foo.tmp
Rip it out. Label it obsolete in 2.2.11.
