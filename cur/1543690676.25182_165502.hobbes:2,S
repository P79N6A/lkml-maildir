Hi there!
I've put 2.6.0-test5 yesterday on a mail server and today I noticed that
there was a huge amount of memory 'missing' from vmstat.
So I took a look at slabinfo and found out that file_lock_cache has a huge
amount of objects that won't shink down even under memory pressure.
The line, as it is now, looks like:
file_lock_cache   5828600 5828600     96   40    1 : tunables  120   60 \
	8 : slabdata 145715 145715      0
The whole slabinfo is attached.
This is a dual Pentium III with 1Gb RAM and three SCSI disks in two
Adaptec aic7896/97.
I don't know if I can hold the server up for much longer so please if you
want me to get any other information let me know.
Thanks a lot,
		Alberto
