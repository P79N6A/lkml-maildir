I had that.  I just did a fresh fetch and it still happens
akpm2:/usr/src/25> cd /usr/src/git26
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> cat .git/branches/git-battery 
git://git.infradead.org/users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> git-fetch git-battery
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> git-checkout git-battery 
Switched to branch "git-battery"
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> setenv ARCH i386
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> make allmodconfig > /dev/null
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> make vmlinux modules
...

No thanks.  I pull all the git trees approximately once per day.

Yes, I had it all.

You did `make vmlinux modules'?

hm, I'm not using the "battery" branch.  Should I?
akpm2:/usr/src/git26> cat .git/branches/git-battery 
git://git.infradead.org/users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git
I tried
git://git.infradead.org/users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git#battery
but it doesn't exist.

I always do `git-branch -d git-battery' prior to every pull, so rebasings
like that are OK.
