I guess, you are referring to setup_irq() (the line without a
particular kernel version doesn't make much sense).
What do you mean by "never seems to return"? Does your machine hang?
If so, the reason might be some kind of (logical) error in your ISR.
spin_unlock_irqrestore() unmasks the interrupts and your target device
might have already generated an interrupt by this moment (sure, it
depends on the initialization logic of your code and device spec.)...
--> ISR runs and due to some error e.g. loops endlessly/deadlocks/etc.
Tried placing printk() at the beginning of ISR?
