Okay.

It should be mentioned somewhere in the kerneldoc, maybe near the
declaration of your new device_lock() routine.  You might also want to
mention explicitly that a probe() routine shouldn't call through the
driver core to suspend its device because it would deadlock; it should
simply do the suspend directly.

It isn't a problem.  Forget I brought it up -- if anything ends up going
wrong I'll let you know.

Yes.  I realized this yesterday; drivers or subsystems can use the 
device lock themselves to synchronize addition/removal of children.  
There's no need for the core to do anything special.
In fact, the core had better _not_ try to lock the parent while adding a 
child.  The subsystem may already own the lock!  Should this be made a
general requirement of device_add() -- that the caller must have locked 
the parent?

By "open connections", do you mean something more than unsuspended 
children?
Are you proposing to add these counters to struct device?  If so, would 
they be used and maintained by the core or by the driver/subsystem?  I 
should think the core wouldn't know enough about the requirements of 
different devices to do anything useful.  But then if the core doesn't use 
the counters they should be stored in a private data structure, not in 
struct device.
