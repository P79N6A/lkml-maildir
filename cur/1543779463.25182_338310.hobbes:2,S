Oh, and forget TCQ. It's a completely worthless technology inherited
from PATA, whos continued existence can only be explained by some
companies having invested money adding firmware support for it already
and/or because it sounds good to marketing who apparently rely on
customers thinking it must be similar to SCSI TCQ because it shares the
same name. In reality, they really share nothing. IDE TCQ makes a
mockery of the TLA, I hope the people that came up with it bury their
heads in shame for having wasted peoples time actually tring it out.
