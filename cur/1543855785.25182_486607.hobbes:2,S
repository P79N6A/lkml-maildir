Ahh, I think I see where I got confused now.  I thought you wanted to 
save and restore the entropy estimate after a reboot.  I was trying to 
say that you don't want to/can't do that.  I would think that since you 
are, in fact, adding some entropy by writing the data, that increasing 
the entropy count would be fine, you just can't set it to its 'full' 
value ( assuming it was full at shutdown ).

I believe that random and urandom use separate entropy pools, so boot 
scripts save/restore urandom to keep that nicely seeded, but not random. 
  It has to start clean each boot and rely on entropy created by the 
usual input methods.  That is actually why I have a problem with the 
ioctl being required, because I can't just write a simple boot script to 
save/restore random data as is done with urandom, and be able to extract 
some random data right away.
