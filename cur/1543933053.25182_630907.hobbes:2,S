Well, gdb is saner, but the bug you're talking about will be fixed in a
clean way (even for insane debuggers) with  Shaohua's, Roland's and my
fixes to handling the RSE, because they make it possible to get rid of
find_thread_for_addr(). I already sent a mail about it to linux-ia64
some time ago, and Roland suggested we might even change everything to
the generic sys_ptrace(), which is the correct solution (TM), and I'm
planning to do it so as soon as the RSE patches are in.
