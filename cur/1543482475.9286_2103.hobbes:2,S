I'm pretty sure all of this has been discussed thoroughly before. We
already have a highly advanced, very efficient system - TVS. Not only can
the Torvalds Versions System manage the kernel source, it can also care
for multiple child processes, crush the dreams of would-be kernel hackers
:) and in general do the Right Thing (tm).
Thus, TVS > CVS.
