Subject: [PATCH mmotm 4/5] nilfs2: insert explanations in gcinode file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/12/9

The file gcinode.c gives buffer cache functions for on-disk blocks
moved in garbage collection.  Joern Engel has suggested inserting its
explanations in the source file (Message-ID:
<20080917144146.GD8750@logfs.org> and
<20080917224953.GB14644@logfs.org>).
This follows the comment.

+ * This file adds the cache of on-disk blocks to be moved in garbage
+ * collection.  The disk blocks are held with dummy inodes (called
+ * gcinodes), and this file provides lookup function of the dummy
+ * inodes and their buffer read function.
+ *
+ * Since NILFS2 keeps up multiple checkpoints/snapshots accross GC, it
+ * has to treat blocks that belong to a same file but have different
+ * checkpoint numbers.  To avoid interference among generations, dummy
+ * inodes are managed separatly from actual inodes, and their lookup
+ * function (nilfs_gc_iget) is designed to be specified with a
+ * checkpoint number argument as well as an inode number.
+ *
+ * Buffers and pages held by the dummy inodes will be released each
+ * time after they are copied to a new log.  Dirty blocks made on the
+ * current generation and the blocks to be moved by GC never overlap
+ * because the dirty blocks make a new generation; they rather must be
+ * written individually.
