Then we bend the rules and accept it :)
We'll take these as a case-by-case basis...

Security fixes go from the security team to Linus's tree directly, and
usually the subsystem maintainer has already been notified and has
reviewedit.  At that point in time, they are public and accepted into
mainline, and need to be made availble to the -stable users as soon as
possible.
That is why the "fast track" is going to happen, the patch really was
reviewed properly, just not in public :)
