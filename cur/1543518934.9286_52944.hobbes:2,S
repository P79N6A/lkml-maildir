Subject: Calling VESA BIOS routines from kernel?

	I am contemplating the idea of implementing support in the
kernel for calling the VESA video BIOS routines for reading DDC
timing information from the monitor (to improve autoconfiguration of
the X window system and svgalib).  I see that the kernel APM support
appears to do something like this, but my naive attempt to do something
similar with the DDC calls resulted in a kernel panic.
	So, I am wondering: are the APM calls special in that they
can still work even though the kernel has already thoroughly messed
with the hardware, put the process into 32-bit protected mode, and
so on, or are all VESA BIOS extensions generally supposed to support
being called from a 32-bit protected mode operating system (i.e., is there
hope for this approach, or do I have to try to hack the boot loader)?
