Also, we do trust gcc not to screw up on lots of other stuff. I.e., we
trust it to use registers wisely (register anyone?), to set up sane
counting loops and related array handling (noone is using pointers to
traverse arrays "for speed" anymore), and to select the best code sequence
for the machine at hand in lots of cases, ... And not only for the kernel,
for the whole userspace too!
Sure, this is a large change, and it might be warranted to place it under
CONFIG_NEW_COMPILER_OPTIONS (Marked experimental, high explosive, etc if it
makes you too uneasy).
