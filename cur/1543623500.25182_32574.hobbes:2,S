I fixed something in this area for x86, looks like the same code path
for MIPS unless I'm misreading.
smp_init spins waiting on wait_init_idle until every cpu has done
init_idle. rest_init() isn't called until smp_init returns, so I'm not sure
how you could hit this (possibly there's a minute window after init_idle
clears the bit, but before it returns?).
