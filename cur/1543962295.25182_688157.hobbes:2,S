no, that isnt it. im talking ram USAGE. :)

Im afraid this theory also isnt the case, i know what the cache is, and
i also know how to subtract :)

Well yes that seems somewhat big, however, the kernel was the ONLY
change.
i can also say that i have noticed this on my own workstation, however
thats not really an as valid case, as i have also upgraded userspace and
such over time, but it used to be that my box wouldnt use more than
~100mb to boot into X with kde open, and about ~300mb at browsing/mail
and such, but these days my workstation easily uses 1.5gb of ram for no
apparent reason..
something certainly is fishy around here, these days people just tend to
fix it by throwing 10 times more ram in than should really be necessary,
which i guess, is because the ram prices has dropped 10 times
