that is only because internally in the block-layer we use sectors. Eg. the
RAID code already does nothing sector-ish itself, so you can have
4G*blocksize devices with RAID, which is 16 TBytes with 4k blocks. (and
more with bigger blocks) I have not actually tried this myself :) RAID0
still relies on sectors internally [can be fixed], but RAID1/RAID5 not.
