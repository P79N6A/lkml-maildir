Are you sure about the '&&'? The original patch I submitted to you earlier 
today was checking for (bd->props.fb_blank == FB_BLANK_UNBLANK || 
bd->props.power == FB_BLANK_UNBLANK), and I tested it (to some extent) and 
it worked well - no sudden unblanking without reason, no blinking, etc.
I also think that common sense implies that the condition should be 
logical or - backlight layer could request blanking without requesting 
powering the device off, right? We want to handle unblanking from such 
situation properly, which doesn't necessairly mean we will get 
bd->props.power == FB_BLANK_UNBLANK, right?
