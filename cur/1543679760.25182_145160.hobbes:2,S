It's not an exploit. It's called "random access" or a "sparse mapping".

Hashtables and B-trees are sane designs in my book.
The entire point of the exercise on 64-bit is to allow indexing
algorithms _some_ method of restoring virtual locality so as to
cooperate with the kernel and not throw away vast amounts of space
on pagetables.
Locality of reference in itself is typically already present in the
data access patterns.

I don't know what kind of moron you take me for but I don't care to be
patronized like that.
There is a very, very large difference between utter idiocy like the
above and sparse mappings. And there is a _much_ larger difference
when you add in direct cooperation from userspace to conserve resources
otherwise consumed by sparse mappings by compacting virtualspace with
remap_file_pages() and bullshit like implicitly checking if user pages
are 0 before trying to swap them out.
Color me thoroughly disgusted.

It doesn't even need to be an artifact of a design like a hash table or
a B-tree. It can be totally linear and 1:1 but the inputs will mandate
random access.
This entire tangent is ridiculous; the entire counterargument centers
around some desire not to go through the straightforward steps to
support a preexisting feature on the pretext of some notion that
cooperating with the kernel so as not to throw away vast amounts of
space on pagetables and/or vma's is an invalid application behavior.
