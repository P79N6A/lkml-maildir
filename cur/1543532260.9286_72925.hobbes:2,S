I think I see what you mean...perhaps we could do this by updating the
stat data to reflect which blocks have actually been written.  If we read
a file that is incomplete, we have a choice of truncating off the bad
data, or simply refusing to service any operations for that file.  Or did
you intend something else (my idea wouldn't be zero cost).
