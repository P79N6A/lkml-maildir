The problem with that patch is that it is filling the logs, but it is
certainly better than shutting the machine down without warning. I had
that problem and it took me a few minutes to figure out that it was
ACPI.
However, I didn't have that problem with kernel 2.6.0 test 9, it
appeared with 2.6.0 test 10 and test 11. I have mailed the list to see
if there was no patch I could reverse to determine where the problem
was, but I got no reaction, so I guess I will have to live with it ;)
