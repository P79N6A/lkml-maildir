All,
I've now tested the following;
2.6.17-rc6-mm2 with the following patch applied;
---
git-acpi.patch from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17-rc6/2.6.17-rc6-mm2/broken-out/
---
With no difference to the end-result.
Next I stripped out 802.11 generic support and acx111 drivers from the 
kernel (including the acpi patches) to check if it clashes, but the same 
errors occur....
Thirdly, I booted with acpi=off on the command line with two kernels, 
the stock 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 (no acpi patch and including acx111) and the 
one including the acpi patch and no acx111, the results were;
acpi_patch;
works a treat, picks up USB devices as expected.
stock;
works a treat, picks up USB devices as expected, and my acx111 card 
works too :)
Now I'm looking for good suggestions again, this definitely looks like 
it is related to ACPI, hence the cc' to that list too, as requested by 
Andrew M.
I'm happy to apply patches / config changes as appropriate and for those 
who may ask for my .config files, please see;

Also, I left the output of lspci there for reference;

Cheers,
