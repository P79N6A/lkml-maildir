I think the NICs on all the systems are 3c905b's.  The system with the
2.4 kernel on it has them and I think that is what I put in my 2.6-11
test system as well.  My 2.6 system doesn't have a modules.conf file so
I will need to dig a little deeper.  I suppose I could just open it up
and look.  But I am almost sure I put 3c905b cards in both test systems.

Which driver, and does it occur with other drivers. Also you really want
to move this to netdev@oss.sgi.com to get the best network folks to see
it.
