You are right. I have not contributed anything to Linux. Except one
small patch to the MTD code. However, I don't think that is the point
here. I am perfectly willing to live with the way Linux is today. I am
telling you as a user that if Linux continues on the current path it
will become less and less attractive to Embedded Users.
Not everybody has to be a contributor. The reason Linux is popular is
because of its openness. Take that away and see where it goes.
