Sorry alan, it is not like that.
Problem is even if you don't use any bios functions (you do not
normally use any vesa bios functions at runtime!) you spend just too
much time in kernel space and mp3 player fails to meet that deadline.
So cure could be few schedules() at strategical places in fbcon
