Ack.
Some people are putting Linux kernels in the "BIOS" (i.e. ROM chip) when
using LinuxBIOS (www.linuxbios.org). It _does_ make a lot of difference
there how big the kernel is. At the moment you can't do that with
anything smaller than a 1 MB chip. But if people could use 512 KB chips
because the kernel is small enough that would sure be a great thing.
In such scenarios every single byte matters.
Uwe.
