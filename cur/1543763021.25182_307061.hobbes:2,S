Hi Hirofumi,
Why is shortname=lower the default mount option for vfat filesystems? 
Because, with "shortname=lower", copying one FAT32 filesystem tree to 
another FAT32 filesystem tree using Liux results in semantically 
different filesystems. (E.g.: Filenames which were once "all uppercase" 
are now "all lowercase").
With "shortname=mixed", such semantic changes would not occur. That's 
why I'd consider "shortname=lower" as default mount option as a bug. I'd 
propose "shortname=mixed" as default as a fix for this bug.
What do you think?
ciao,
Xuân.
P.S.: "man mount" says:
       shortname=[lower|win95|winnt|mixed]
              Defines the behaviour for creation and display of 
filenames which fit into 8.3 characters. If a long name for a file 
exists, it will always be preferred display. There are four modes:
              lower  Force the short name to lower case upon display; 
store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.
              win95  Force the short name to upper case upon display; 
store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.
              winnt  Display the shortname as is; store a long name when 
the short name is not all lower case or all upper case.
              mixed  Display the short name as is; store a long name 
when the short name is not all upper case.
       The default is "lower".
