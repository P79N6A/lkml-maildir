No idea; smoking is prohibited in SuSE offices, so someone external
had to do that ;-).
I have not seen SuSE version of bootsplash... I do not want to
see. But this way, SuSE has its own crappy bootsplash, RedHat probably
too, Mandrake probably too, etc.
And now, SUSE will want splash over swsusp, RedHat probably too,
Madrake probably too, etc. I do not want to deal with 3 different sets
of hooks into swsusp.
Now.. Perhaps cleaned-up bootsplash could find its way into
kernel. That would at least turn down ammount of crap in
distributions. At least there would be unified way to turn that thing
off...
Or at least standartized hooks for various splashes, so that I do not
have to deal with 3 different sets?
