Yes, it's known, I sent two patches to fix it
	[PATCH] VmLib wrapped: executable brk
	[PATCH] VmLib wrapped: mprotect flags
on 28 Nov 2004, and those were included in 2.6.10.
It's just an ugliness in the numbers shown, doesn't affect how the
kernel runs: so Red Hat have not bothered to fix it in their update.
