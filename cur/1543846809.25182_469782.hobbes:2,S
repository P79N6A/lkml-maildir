Subject: 2.6.18 LTP failures

sched_setscheduler02    1  FAIL  :  sched_setscheduler(2) passed with 
non root priveledges
sysfs01     1  FAIL  :  sysfs(2) Failed for option 1 and set errno to 22
To be fair, I have no idea if these are failures in LTP itself or
2.6.18, but thought I'd mention them. On the upside, we seem to have
way less failures than we used too (mostly LTP problems, used to be)
LTP version is 20060918
