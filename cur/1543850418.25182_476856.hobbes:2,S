No they aren't because they have compat routines that convert the bitmaps
before calling the "normal" syscall.  They, importantly, only use
compat_alloc_user_space once each.

You need the compat_ version of the syscalls to know if you were called
from a 32bit application in order to know if you may need to fixup the
bitmaps that are passed from/to user mode.
