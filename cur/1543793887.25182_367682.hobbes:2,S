Curious question:
  If I configure multiple IP addresses to a NIC, and assign 1.2.3.4 to 
eth0 and 5.6.7.8 to eth0:0 (a virtual NIC) is there extra work involved 
on the part of the CPU or memory or whatever in routing traffic via 
5.6.7.8 than 1.2.3.4.. I mean does one IP have an advantage over the 
other in any sense?
Thanks,
  Davy
