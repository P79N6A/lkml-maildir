Renaming it, if that is all you want, is fine by everyone, I'm sure.  I was
trying to make the point that it is NOT a config option, because for some
architectures, you only want it defined for SOME FILES.
architectures that define CONFIG_UID16 get high2lowuid() all the time
	- no changes needed on any of them
architectures that do not define CONFIG_UID16 and don't want it ever get
straight uids, no high2lowuid() cruft
	- no changes needed on any of them
architectures that can use uid16.c code, but do not want high2lowuid()
everywhere need to change
	- define CONFIG_UID16_SYSCALLS  (build uid16.o)
	- explicitly call out where it wants high2lowuid()
		- this was called __UID16, but can be called
		CONFIG_UID16_HERE or REALLY_DO_HIGHUID_CRAP or FRED for all
		I care.
I just want to make sure that you're telling me to name something CONFIG_FOO
when, in fact, it is defined by various bits of code that want to change the
behavior of a particular header.
In that case we can just have them define CONFIG_UID16 and not add an OR in
there at all.  I just thought you'd find a .c file defining CONFIG_FOO to be
grosser, yet.  But on further argument, I guess it's not.
I'll consider it a done deal, unless you want to stop me :)  Martin, do you
want to just change the __UID16 defines to CONFIG_UID16 and nix the || in
highuid.h and resubmit?
I have the same patch in my local tree.
