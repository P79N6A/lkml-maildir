Hi Richard,
Bummer! Do you think that each of those events was a "last close" 
of the port? Doesn't bash hold the port open while the `color-ls` 
runs? 
Since the path only delays (doesn't change modem control), these 
closes must have been hidden by quick reopens. Does the unmodified 
agetty set the baud rate to zero to hangup, or was that your change? 
I was thinking that I could move the delay to the code that 
disconnects when baud rate zero is set. 
your thoughts?
Cheers,
Ed
