You also want to catch not-quite-NULL pointer dereferences,
where you dereference the member of a large struct or array,
but the array or struct pointer itself was NULL.
Eg. you try to fetch the 100,000th from an array, but you
got passed a NULL array pointer.  Getting a segfault is
much, much better than corrupting data.
