No need. Thanks for the offer.

My application calls "exit" (*). My workaround was to type
	touch <destfile>
to get things to work. In my situation, I was worried about the more
general case, and not really about my personal situation.
I could integrate the "touch <destfile>" into my application, but I
think it is the OS's duty to do this for me. This would be the easiest
non-manual fix for me.
	Roger.
(*) So please check that: 
	- mmap file
	- change mmapped area
	- exit
also works (modifies the timestamp).

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
