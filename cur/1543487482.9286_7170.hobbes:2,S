Hi
I'm administarting a DEC Alpha 800 server from Digital running Linux
Redhat 5.2. After an upgrade from kernel 2.0.34 to 2.0.36 it has crashed
twice with no warnings. All i leaves is the console with this message:
Aiee scheduling in interrupt fffffc0000336668
I would appriciate if someone could give me a clue about what is
happening and how it can be preventet. Upgrading to a newer kernel is a
possibility I'm willing to work with since the raid-controller needs the
newest possible kernel. Downgrading is NOT an option. Fixing it will
please me :-)
Hope that someone can help.
