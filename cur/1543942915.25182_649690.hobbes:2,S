I'm familiar with them to some extent because I have run companies in the
past and continue to do so as a sideline to my Red Hat work. I also spend
more time than I'd like talking to lawyers about licencing.

First mistake: The GPL is not a contract it is a license.
If the GPL was a contract it could most certainly impose conditions upon
original works. Contract law permits to write things like "If you buy the
source for this package you agree not to write a competing product for
three years even if an origina work".
