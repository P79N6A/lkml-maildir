Heh.
Why the hell doesn't that thing just do an "fstat()" on the thing, and 
compare the inode number? Not that I would guarantee that it works either 
for a socket, but it would seem to make more sense than what it apparently 
does now, and I think it should work at least on Linux.
(Ie linux will give fake "st_ino" numbers to sockets. Whether anybody else 
will do that, I have no friggin clue. And you probably shouldn't depend on 
it even under Linux, but damn, despite all of those issues, it's likely 
better and more logical than what libnss-ldap apparently does now ;)
Doing a "fstat()" call is how you generally test if two fd's point to the 
same file. Doing the same thing for sockets would at least be half-way 
sane, and even if the OS doesn't give new sockets individual st_ino 
numbers, they probably won't be *changing*.
