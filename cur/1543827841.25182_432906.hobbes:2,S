because there is IMHO legally nothing we can do about it anyway.  Use of
an industry-standard API that is provided in multiple operating system
is one of the clearest idnication of some program _not_ being a
derivative work.
Whether we like it or not, it doesn't really matter if we export them
GPL-only or not.  Anybody using those scoket API calls will be having an
easy time arguing in favor of non-derivative work.
The GPL doesn't extend beyon what copyright law allows you to do...
