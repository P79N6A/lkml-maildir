	My thinking was that the preconditions in my tree for
calling release_sysfs_dirent are dirent->s_dentry == NULL and
list_empty(&dirent->s_sibling).  The latter should be apparent
from two lines above, but the former is less obvious, although
it is also theoretically always true.
	I'm OK with deleting the BUG_ON().  It was not verifying
anything passed in by an outside caller.
