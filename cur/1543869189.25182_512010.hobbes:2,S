Yes, because the EDID has only 1 mode entry. But now you can use 'fbset
1024x768-60' (or any mode smaller than 1600x1200-60) for example and it
should work.  You might want to change  vfmin and vfmax to 59 and 61
respectively just to get leeway for mode calculation errors. This is in
drivers/video/fbmon.c, particularly b[5] and b[6] in this code:
	case FBMON_FIX_TIMINGS:
		printk("fbmon: trying to fix monitor timings\n");
		b = edid + DETAILED_TIMING_DESCRIPTIONS_START;
		for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
			if (!(edid_is_serial_block(b) ||
			      edid_is_ascii_block(b) ||
			      edid_is_monitor_block(b) ||
			      edid_is_timing_block(b))) {
				b[0] = 0x00; 
				b[1] = 0x00;  
				b[2] = 0x00;
				b[3] = 0xfd;   
				b[4] = 0x00;
				b[5] = 60;   /* vfmin */
				b[6] = 60;   /* vfmax */
				b[7] = 30;   /* hfmin */
				b[8] = 75;   /* hfmax */
				b[9] = 17;   /* pixclock - 170 MHz*/
				b[10] = 0;   /* GTF */
				break;
			}
			b += DETAILED_TIMING_DESCRIPTION_SIZE; 
		}
Also try doing fbset 640x480-60, 800x600-60, 1024x768-60 and
1280x1024-60, and if they displayed correctly, we can add these modes to
your EDID block.
