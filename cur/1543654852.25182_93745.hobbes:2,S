hi,
I'm trying to install a linux kernel on a 686 on a PC 104 board (it is
intended to fly on a UAV). it has a 33MB Flash Disk (which is the only
hard disk on the computer). i compile the kernel on a host machine (which
has red hat 7.3 , with rt linux on top of it), and then make a bzdisk. so
far so good. when i try to boot the pc104 machine with the floppy though,
it comes up with the following error:
hda3: bad access: block=2, count=2
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 2
EXT3-fs: unable to read superblock
hda3: bad access: block=2, count=2
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 2
EXT3-fs: unable to read superblock
hda3: bad access: block=64, count=2
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 64
EXT3-fs: unable to read superblock
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=03:03, iso_blknum=16, block=32
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:03
I tried looking up this error on mailing list archives, and it seems a
possible solution is to try passing "ide=reverse" as a kernel option. i'm
not sure when to do that though, because the pc104 is booting directly
from the bzdisk, and does not give me a chance to enter any command line
options.
i'm a newbie when it comes to compiling kernels, so any help would be
appreciated!
thanks,
sonal
