Exactly.

Yes, but there are userspace *drivers* that have to be loaded for that code to 
work properly. By providing the daemon no program needs to worry about 
loading those drivers.

Stuff like that would probably be best left to small userspace helpers, or 
potentially 1 userspace helper that figures out what to do based on what the 
name is that's given to the link.
