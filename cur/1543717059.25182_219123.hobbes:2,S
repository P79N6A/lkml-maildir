Hm, this patch does work, but it seems to break the synaptics driver for 
XFree86:
(II) Synaptics touchpad driver version 0.13.0
Configured Mouse no synaptics event device found (checked 5 nodes)
(EE) xf86OpenSerial: No Device specified.
Synaptics driver unable to open device
(EE) PreInit failed for input device "Configured Mouse"
(II) UnloadModule: "synaptics"
