Something like sysfs' "detach_state" comes to my mind...

The question is how much policy we want in the kernel instead of in
userspace. The actual implementation (i.e. fast transitions to idle states)
must be in the kernel, of course. However the policy decision of whether to
do such idling can and IMHO should be done in userspace.
