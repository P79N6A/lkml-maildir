Missed to include the "mount: you must specify the filesystem type" in
the bug report. My mount attempt prints this message and the mount is
correctly rejected (at least as far as I know).
I could make my kernel crash rather fast when I forced it to use much
swap.
And, almost forgot, my swap partition was active (swapon /dev/hda1) when I
tested to mount it.
