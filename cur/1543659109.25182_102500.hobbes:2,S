Subject: [PATCH] small bugfix to tasklet_kill
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Find a mini-patch below, which is a bugfix to the tasklet_kill()
code. It removes the last line of the function, which clears the
TASKLET_STATE_SCHED bit.
Some more explanation:
That a tasklet has been scheduled for processing is marked by
the TASKLET_STATE_SCHED bit. If this bit is set, a call to
tasklet_schedule() does nothing. If it is cleared, the tasklet
is put on the processing queue (call to __tasklet_schedule()).
After processing the tasklet the TASKLET_STATE_SCHED bit is
cleared (so by calling tasklet_schedule() it will be put on the
processing queue).
The trick to kill a tasklet (function tasklet_kill() ) is:
    - set the TASKLET_SCHEDULE_BIT, but at the same time
    - take care that the tasklet is _not_ on the processing queue.
This is done by waiting for the execution of the tasklet (if it
is scheduled) and then _setting_ the bit.
