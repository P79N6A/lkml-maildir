I've finally kicked out a new release of my ketchup kernel patching
tool. Ketchup is a tool for updating or switching between versions of
the Linux kernel source. It can:
 * find the latest versions of numerous kernel trees
 * calculate which patches are needed to move to that version
 * download any patches or tarballs that aren't cached
 * check GPG signatures where available
 * apply and unapply patches to get the desired result
So for instance, I can painlessly switch a tree from 2.6.12-rc2-mm1 to the
latest -rt patch from Ingo by typing:
$ ketchup 2.6-rt
The latest version can be found at:
