    FWIW, on all the hardware I have, Windows is able to deal with:
    (1) hibernate Windows
    (2) run $(OTHER_OS)
    (3) resume Windows
... which seems to me to say that Linux is doing it wrong if it can't
handle other ACPI users between hibernate and resume.  But maybe
that's just my hardware.
