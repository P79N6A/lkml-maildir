Looking closer again (and not at 1am), I see I missed this line in reading
your patch, sorry:
+#define this_cpu(var)	per_cpu(var,smp_processor_id())
I still think that tracking per_cpu_offset in task struct to eventually
replace current->processor is a win. Basically everyone except Sparc goes
through current anyway for smp_processor_id and Sparc caches current in a
register. Please elucidate your reference to "arch-specific tradeoffs".
Also, it'd be nice to unmap the original copy of the area or at least
poison it to catch silent references to var without going through
this_cpu, which will probably prove very hard to find. If there were a way
to do this at the C source level and catch such things at compile time,
that'd be even better, but I can't see a way to do it without grotty
macros.
