Subject: mount hfs on SCSI cdrom = segfault

i have a hybrid cd (both HFS, ISO9660) , i have two CD drives,
one IDE CD-Rom (actima 32x), and one SCSI CD-burner (yamaha 6416)
on an advansys cfg-510 ISA scsi card
when i try to mount on IDE using hfs with:
    mount -v -r -t hfs /dev/hdc /cdrom
it works fine, yet when i try on scsi with:
    mount -v -r -t hfs /dev/scd0 /cdrom
i get a "Segmentation fault" error, no more output given,
it also locks the drive, and sometimes i can use the
'eject' command to eject it, sometimes i cant and i gotta reboot
once though i did get a memory dump, unfortunately i didnt get
all the info, i do remember it saying this (and im sure of 2555):
    kernel bug in buffer.c:2555
im using kernel 2.4.20 with no patches
note: when i try to mount the cd using regular iso9660 fs, it
works perfectly on both cd drives,
also i have tried 2 hybrid cd's, both times i have trouble mounting
hfs on the scsi drive only
