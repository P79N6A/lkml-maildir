I had similar problem - on an Intel 440BX based motherboard (ABIT BX-133
RAID) the 256MB DIMMs I originally got were only 'half-detected' (e.g. I
got only 128MB from each one); These DIMMs were working OK on some
VIA-based systems; after changing them to a different type (both old and
new were ECC DIMMs from Kingston, just different type) they are working
OK.
I it could be of any help, I can find the part numbers/names of my DIMMs.

Or maybe another DIMM type - at least I was able to successfully use 256MB
DIMMs of appropriate type.
I also don't think kernel tricks would not get back the lost memory here.
