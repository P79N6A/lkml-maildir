Too little time ;).
Thanks to Oleg I can reproduce the lockup (w my patch) or the leakage (w/o
my patch) here.
Now I have one hour (abused from my sleep time) to think about the issue.
<DANGER DANGER>
my latest patch I sent can cause your computer to lockup. So better using
clean 2.2.1 or 2.2.2-pre1 and leaking slowly ;).
