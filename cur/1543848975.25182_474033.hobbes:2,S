Yuck...  If we really want to switch to it (and I can give you a dozen
examples of possible users right now - starting with struct file), putting
namei_ into it is both uninformative and ugly.
I'm not sure what would be the good name here; "pathname" comes to mind,
but it suggests that we are dealing with a string.  And "location" is
too vague (and probably would cause fsckloads of conflicts itself).
Suggestions?  "pathname" would almost work; the difference is that this
is not a string but a node in tree that string resolves to.
