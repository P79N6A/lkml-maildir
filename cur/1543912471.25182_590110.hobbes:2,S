Sorry for the delay, but my desktop PC had an urgent hard disk problem I 
had to fix ASASP.
So here is the output from dmesg that suggested to me that firewire 
might be a problem:

The problem wa sinitiated by closing the lid. The iBook then seems to 
permanetly try to go to sleep (I can hear the cd-rom drive get 
periodically initialized). So above contains more than one iteration.
The kernel is:
> Linux kismet 2.6.22-1-powerpc #1 Sun Jul 29 13:58:06 CEST 2007 ppc GNU/Linux
The relveant debian package:
> linux-image-2.6.22-1-powerpc_2.6.22-3_powerpc.deb
I'm running a mixture of debian testing/unstable.
The firewire and the USB connector were unused, the network connector 
was used.
If there are questions regarding other packages, or somebody wants me to 
test a fix (I would prever a debian package), don't hesitate - I would 
like to get the bug fixed :-)
