If it is indeed BIC than we have a bug where it doesn't shut itself off 
for low latencies. Since we don't test this case extensively here (we 
work to improve high-speed and just make sure we don't ruin slower 
speeds) I can't say it's impossible, try turning BIC off and see if it 
helps.
Due to the scenario that the OP gave it is more likely something to do 
with auto-detection somewhere along the way or a driver bug. It is also 
possible that I'm mistaken and it is BIC, never hurts to check.
