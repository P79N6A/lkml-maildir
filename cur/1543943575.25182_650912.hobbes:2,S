I would like to see a boot log with v3 of my patch at least so that I can 
see what is going on. Can you please supply one?
If you booted the patch as you claimed earlier that should be quite 
easy for you.

We discussed this back then with Nvidia engineers and they stated
that only NF5 would need timer overrides. 
I suppose they didn't know about the case of your NF4 though. The only
reason for that I can think of is that your particular board differs
in non trivial ways from the reference design. Ok I suppose that's 
possible.

Yes that's true, but that was the case anyways even without my
patch. Without my patch timer overrides are ignored on all Nvidia
boards without HPET. 
So no regression. And with HPET you should be fine for v2+

No, we have NF3 and NF4 systems which have bogus timer overrides
unfortunately. If it was only for the NF2 everything would be easy.

DMI generally doesn't scale for any issues that are in reference
BIOS, because there are so many different OEMs. 
It might work for your specific board though. But again that does not
change with or withouyt my patch. On the other hand since your board
seems to have a BIOS update available with hpet enabled it seems
to work now, so your box is covered anyways.
Admittedly the cases my patch fixes are not very wide -- it is basically
only NF5 boards that do have an old BIOS without HPET. For everything
else it should be ideally a noop (if not I did something wrong).
Maybe those NF5 boards with old pre Vista certified BIOS are dying
out, but at least when I wrote the patch originally there were several
users were which had NF5 boards without HPET and no BIOS update available.
