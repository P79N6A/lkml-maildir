I'm hoping to get the whole thing in mm once all these replies are dealt
with. Does that sound unrealistic?
try_to_freeze() should certainly be possible, because it was Andrew's
idea to start with.

Could get triggered by user pressing SysRq. (Or via a panic?). I don't
think the SysRq should result in a panic; nor should a panic result in a
recursive call to panic (although I'm wondering here, wasn't the call to
syncing in panic taken out?).
