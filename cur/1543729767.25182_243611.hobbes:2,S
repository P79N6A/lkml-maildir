Olaf, I'm trying to understand the problem.  We currently have a system
where modprobe resolves aliases, and that's good because it allows users
to override those aliases.  We could have a "modprobe --resolve-aliases"
function, but that breaks down if the user puts in an install command,
which they should be able to do.
Looking through SLES and my Debian system, I see:
1) Modules which never want autoloading (eg. evbug)
2) Modules which defer to other modules (eg. de4x5)
3) Modules for which you want to suppress autoloading altogether because
they cause problems, or are handled by other subsystems.
For (1), the information should be contained in the module itself.  This
will involve a kernel patch.
For (2), the information should be placed in /etc/modprobe.d/ overriding
those aliases the preferred way.
For (3), modprobe cannot have this in a config file, because what needs
to be blacklisted depends on who is invoking modprobe.  For example,
there's a comment that ISDN modules on SuSE are not handled by hotplug,
but /etc/init.d/isdn.
So, a solution would be:
a) A "MODULE_NO_TABLES" macro which suppresses ID table alias
generation,
b) A -X argument to modprobe which says "don't load these modules", and
c) Change modprobe to load all the aliases which match, not just one?  I
hadn't done this because I wasn't aware of anything which needed it: is
there something?
I think we're getting there: sorry if I seem a bit obtuse...
Rusty.
