Ok, well, you should have said that first ;)
Because what I'm asking (the change to pci_read_bridge_bases()) for
copying all transparent bridge resources will just not affect setup-bus,
so you shouldn't have a problem with it. Currently, setup-bus cannot deal
with my hosts already, copying all 4 resources won't make this worse ;)
If your arch can use setup-bus today, it won't be harmed as it won't
have anything in that 4th resource anyway.
Now, regarding improving setup-bus to deal with such weird cases and stop
relying on fixed resource layout, well... that will be my job or the
job for whoever wants to make it work on PPC (or other arch with similar
need). It's something I have on my long-term todolist, but no time to
dedicate to yet right now.
Ben.
