For the results on the darn URL.

If the workload is touching every byte of the workload immediately after a
page fault then prezeroing is not effective. Its only useful for sparse
accesses (like page tables etc).

The kernel would have zeroed a page uselessly at an idle time.

There will be no regression (as shown on the unnamed URL) if the scrubd
is only run during idle times (and also there will be no regression if
the known zeroed pages are returned to the hotlists and then
used).
Kscrubd is an experimental configuration option. Switch it off[default]
and the zero hotlists are only populated by the return of known zeroed
pages via free_hot_zeroed_page etc.
