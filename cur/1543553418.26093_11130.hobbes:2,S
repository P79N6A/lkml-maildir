Anyone interested in advanced debuging features:
I've reved the SysRQ Registration Patch, available at:
http://bama.ua.edu/~dunna001/sysrq-register/
The latest is 0.10, and applies to 2.2.18-pre9, 2.4.0-test10-pre6,
and 2.4.0-test10-pre7. I got tired of reving the patch accross
6 versions, so I am going to do all future revs against the latest 2.2
and 2.4.
I've changed some symbol names to be shorter/saner, cleaned up some formating,
and made some trivial efficieny tweaks that the compiler *should* do on its own,
anyway, but what the hell.
I also played with the example modules a bit, and fixed an SMP problem one of them had.
I really think that this would make a good addition to the kernel, and it touches a
relatively small amount of code. Please examine this, and tell me what you think.
