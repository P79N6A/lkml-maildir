Ok, fair enough. Please add my Acked-by then.
On a related topic, can we put something in place that can check for
this error at run-time, like a WARN_ON(is_kernel_stack(addr)) in
dma_map_single?
Since I only copied this code from elsewhere, I would suspect that
there are lots of similar bugs that never get found on common hardware
otherwise.
