I guess the cleanest solution would be to allow variable setting of the
maximum number of PCI busses in the config file, similar to the
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTY_COUNT setting, so that "exotic" users with 32+ PCI
busses can boost the standard value according to their needs, without
having to increase kernel size for the normal users.

Udo.
