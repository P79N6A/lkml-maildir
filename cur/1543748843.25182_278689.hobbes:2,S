I'd like to see the code even if it's not ready for inclusion or anything
along those lines just to see what other kind of problems you ran into.

A generalized system to do this is pretty important for folks doing things
like QoS over things like Firewire, SCSI, USB, and other high speed busses
of that nature including networking layers. Folks doing things with clusters
would love to have something like that if the subsystem layer above the
driver responsible for handling the protocol was modified to have this
ability.
One thing that I noticed in this thread is that even though you were talking
about the mechanisms to support these features, it really needs some
consideration as to how it's going to effect the stock kernel since you're
really introduction a first-class threading object/concept into the system.
That means changes to the scheduler, how QoS fits into this, etc...
IMO, it's ultimately about QoS and that alone is a hot button since it's
so invasive throughout the kernel.
Creating a special threaded server object (thinking out loud) might be a
good idea in that it could be attached to any arbitrary subsystem at will,
assuming if that particular subsystem's logic permits this easily.
It's not a light topic and can certain require more folks pushing it. I'm
very interested in getting something like this into Linux, but stability,
latency regularity, contention are things that still need a lot of work.

This is a good track to research casually since not that many people have
done so, and so that the problem space is mapped in this particular kernel.
With things like VoIP and relatives becoming popular, this is becoming
more and more essential over time.
It's up to you, but I think this is a great track to pursue.. That's because
if you don't do it, somebody else will... :)
