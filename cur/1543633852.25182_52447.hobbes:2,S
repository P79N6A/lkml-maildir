That reminds me of some idea I had been thinking about for some time: 
What about adding some pci_request_irq() and pci_request_{,mem_}_region,
which would allow for some cleanup of ever-recurring code sequences in
drivers, and which at the same time would allow for the above?
pci_request_mem_region() might even include the ioremap() as well ;)
And yeah, eventually, that might be better done at 'struct device' level,
but that doesn't make a difference to the conceptual idea.
