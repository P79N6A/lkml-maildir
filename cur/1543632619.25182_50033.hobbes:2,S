It turns out that I missed an important bit (literally) in that patch
(and another few files got corrupted....)
Just after (or before)
 +			clear_bit(BH_Freed, &bh->b_state);
We need
 +			clear_bit(BH_JBDDirty, &bh->b_state);
because __journal_unfile_buffer will convert JBDdirty to Dirty just
like __journal_refile_buffer does.
