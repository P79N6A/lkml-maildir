Ok. I will defer the bitvector patch now. 
I had it mostly working with hacks, but than I ran into
a nasty include ordering problem that scared me off so far.

Ok. I will change it to a VMA.
Only bad thing is that this has to be done at program startup.
At fault time we cannot upgrade the read lock on mmap sem to a write
lock that is needed to insert the VMA :/ But I guess that is ok
because with modern glibc basically all programs will use vsyscsall.
