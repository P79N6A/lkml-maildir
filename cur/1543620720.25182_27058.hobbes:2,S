Just finished building 2.5.4 after
  1 - applying akpm's patch
  2 - removing Maestro3 sound support
  3 - switching from xircom_tulip_cb to xircom_cb
Since 2 and 3 are already reported and known, here's one more to report:
find kernel -path '*/pcmcia/*' -name '*.o' | xargs -i -r ln -sf ../{} pcmcia
if [ -r System.map ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  2.5.4; fi
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.4/kernel/net/irda/irda.o
depmod: 	virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
