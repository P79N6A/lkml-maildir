I only listed the proposals I've heard about before, not necessarily 
endorsing them.

Well complicated code is en vogue recently :-)

Using the radix trees more would be also an alternative.
I honestly don't know how they will all perform in the kernel that is why I 
thought it would be a good idea to just try them out. But I'm not 
volunteering to code it up, so it was more an idle thought.
Doing that would be a reasonable student project. In fact I've been asked 
about this sort of thing by students in the past.
Cleaning up the rbtree interface to be a little more abstract
would be probably a good idea in general. I never really
liked the open coded searches.
