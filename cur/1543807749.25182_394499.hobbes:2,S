are you sure this is not some older VM issue? Unless it's a fundamental 
property of NUMA systems, it would be bad to factor in some VM artifact 
into the caching design.

Most pagecache pages are clean, and it's easy and fast to zap a clean 
page when a new anonymous page needs space. So i dont really see why the 
pagecache is such a big issue - it should in essence be invisible to the 
rest of the VM. (barring the extreme case of lots of dirty pages in the 
pagecache) What am i missing?

loosely coupled clusters do seem to work quite well, since the 
overwhelming majority of computing jobs tend to deal with easily 
partitionable workloads. Making clusters more seemless via software 
(a'ka OpenMosix) is still quite tempting i think.

yeah, you are right.
