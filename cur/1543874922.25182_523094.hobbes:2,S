My local kernel guru recognized this problem as a duplicate of the
LSI8408E bus lockup problem. The controller gets flooded with work,
and just climbs under a rock to hide. In the 8408E case, it
froze the PCI-e bus :-)

# set the max request queue down from 128. any more than 32
# quickly slows down from 810MB/Sec to 11MB/Sec.
#
setenv X 32
#
foreach i ( /sys/block/sd{g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n}/queue/nr_requests)
   echo $X > $i
   end
Lots of time was spent in the congestion queue, like 99% of the time.
