Ah yeah, I agree with that.  Regular events should be uevents or 
something, not input events.  Actual keyboard keys though (whether they 
generate firmware event messages or actual scancodes) should probably 
go through the input layer.  I thought that's what Jeremy's patch was 
doing, maybe I didn't look closely enough.
