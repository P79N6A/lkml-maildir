agreed.

sorry, I don't understand yet.
I think my patch is already function of CPUs and Nodes.
per zone limit indicate propotional #cpus and #nodes.
please tell me the topology that per zone limit doesn't works so good.
I think boot option and sysctl should be used only while -mm
for get various feedback.
end up, we should select more better default, and remove sysctl.
