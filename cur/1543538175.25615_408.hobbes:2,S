I've been lazy for a long time and not bothered to tar it up and make 
releases - ever since I set up anoncvs access. 
But here's the release you've all been waiting for. It features sexy new 
code for driving Common Flash Interface chips, 2.2 and 2.4 ports of Axis' 
Journalling Flash Filesystem, updated FTL code, and lots and lots of code 
cleanups for the places where I'd been particularly stupid. There's even a 
little bit of documentation, which is still mostly relevant despite my best 
efforts to obsolete it.
Get it from 
ftp://ftp.linux-mtd.infradead.org/pub/mtd/mtd-20000704.tar.gz
or preferably:
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@infradead.org:/home/cvs login
		(password "anoncvs")
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@infradead.org:/home/cvs co mtd
A slightly more detailed changelog is on the web page at
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/
 along with the mailing list 
archive.
