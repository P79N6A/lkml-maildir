Hi,
I'm trying to make some modifications in the ethernet layer of my kernel.  For this I'm referring to TCP/IP Illustrated vol-2 by Richard Stevens (written for BSD) and accordingly, I should be modifying my ether_input and ether_output functions of my if_ethersubr.c.  But when I tried to search for the same in linux, I cannot find the same file or the associated functions.
Can anybody point out which way to look at and if possible, suggest me a good book on linux tcp/ip.
Thanks,
Aamir
