Great! But please be kind to those of us who read the source control history
trying to understand the code. Could you make 2 separate patches?

This is racy, the warning could be false. We wake up the task, testing
its ->flags is not reliable.
Damn. PF_FREEZER_SKIP task could be woken before, clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP,
but not frozen.
We can change freezer_count() to clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP after try_to_freeze(),
not before. Now thaw_process() can take PF_FREEZER_SKIP into account and
return "true".
But this means the task may be PF_FREEZER_SKIP | PF_FROZEN. What if we we
call try_to_freeze_tasks() soon after thaw_tasks()? We may hit the task which
leaves the refrigerator, but didn't clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP yet. This means
that thaw_process() should clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP as well. This is messy :(
Any other ideas? In any case we should imho avoid a separate loop for
PF_FREEZER_SKIP tasks to just fix debug messages. In fact it can't help
anyway.
Oleg.
