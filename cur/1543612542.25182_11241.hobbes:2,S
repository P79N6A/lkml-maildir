"adversely"? The patch is an improvement, not something that makes things 
worse...

Huh? Atime updates in the old NTFS driver do not happen at all unless I 
have missed something.
Otherwise, the time resolution itself is down to 100ns intervals which in 
Linux obviously isn't possible, so the Linux atime resolution will be used 
instead.
The new NTFS TNG driver will be doing the atime updates properly once write 
support is implemented.
Best regards,
Anton
