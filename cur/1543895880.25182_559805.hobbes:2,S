I would guess that if you ran 15 drives per channel on 3 different
channels, you would resync in 1/3 the time.  Well unless you end up
saturating the PCI bus instead.
hardware raid of course has an advantage there in that it doesn't have
to go across the bus to do the work (although if you put 45 drives on
one scsi channel on hardware raid, it will still be limited).
