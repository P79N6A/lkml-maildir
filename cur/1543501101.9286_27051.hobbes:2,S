	All the more important:  USE SERIAL CONSOLE LOGGING, AND LOG
				 THAT DATA TO SEPARATE MACHINE!
	I have two machines at my office desk, and I do that both ways.
	It is *so* much simpler to go to the logger machine to see what
	was the last kernel message before the other box croaked...
	(My logger program ?  Manually started Kermit.)
	If you are so poor that you can't afford a small, otherwise
	obsolete 386 box as your logger, well, life is hard...
	( Have then a 8088 box running MSDOS and Kermit to do the logging,
	  if you can find such.. or serial interfaced printer! )

	Collecting the basic reports into a repository along with ensuring
	certain quality degree (technical details, like properly decoded
	Oopses, what compilers are used, what installation, what kind of
	kernel configuration, which source was used, what patches,
	hardware setup, motherboard model, CPU model and stepping, cards,
	issues like MTRR settings, disk information, ...)
	What *other* messages beside Oopses appear in the system ?
	(and again same details)
	Some problems can be truly hard to find, and only shifting thru
	largeish amount of reports could bring up some magic correlation
	giving our "wizards" a way to suspect some odd detail, and not
	only to brush such off as "bad hardware".
	Because there are kwazilion bug-tracking systems around, writing
	one from scratch isn't likely necessary, but even choosing, and
	customizing one into this use is quite difficult task in itself..

	??  Ah:
# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
	that second line is more usefull than plain '--version'.
