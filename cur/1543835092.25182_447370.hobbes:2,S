Josh,
if __acquires() and __releases() are always handled in a
Linux kernel build, then we don't need the bit in actypes.h.
Linux specific changes for sparse will never be used
in upstream ACPICA -- Linux can just diverge on these bits,
like we do for other annotations, like asmlinkage.
thanks,
-Len
