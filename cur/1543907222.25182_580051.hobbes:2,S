Allright. So I see two problems here:
 - in the code that powerpc uses to generate the PCI tree based on the
open firmware device-tree (instead of probing the bus), we don't set the
dma mask to the default ffffffff.
 - our implementation of dma_supported() incorrectly tests against the
-previous- dma mask instead of the one we pass in as an argument.
I'll send a patch later today for you guys to test.
In addition, make sure that ieee1394 properly uses the parent PCI dev
and not some other intermediary struct device for the dma mask. Oh and,
don't do the set_dma_mask() in sbp2, it has nothing to do there. It
should be in the ohci1394 driver.
Cheers,
Ben.
