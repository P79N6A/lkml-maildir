Actually, they are mostly about register allocation. And that's apparently 
why the gcc rules ended up changing: by setting a clobber, you basically 
allocate that register for the instruction, and tell gcc that it's dead.
That's also likely why such a register cannot be an input (or an output): 
it cannot be allocated.
