I decided to try out the new 2.6.0-test2 kernel today but
ran into a problem with booting it.  I narrowed it down to
the machine check expection code.  I get this panic from
the kernel on boot when I have it enabled
CPU0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank0: f606200000000833 at 0000000000004040
Kernel Panic: CPU context corrupt.
I disabled this option in the kernel and recompiled and everything
went smooth.  I figured maybe there could actually possibly be
something wrong with the CPU but I can boot with RedHat's
2.4.20-19 kernel fine which I *think* includes machine check exception
code.  I have no beef with leaving the exception code out but I figured
someone on this list may want to know. 
Little bit of hardware info:
Tyan 2466 motherboard
2 Athon MP 1200 processors
