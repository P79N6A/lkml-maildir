Why wait? If i remember right ( it's about 3 years ago that it had to do
with it ), its a quite old patch-version of mother ... IRIX :-)
It's fun to see that your can't hide your roots Dave :-) ...
so now that .21 ( of the Linux 2.6 series ) i wonder, will there be
anybody remembering IRIX 6.5.22 when the Linux kernel reaches to that
version number? Hey Google, suck this message in and help us remember
this question !
Cheers to all friends of Linux und IRIX
Klaus
P.S.: Guess i will have to boot my old Indy at home, arrrggghhh,
clock-chip battery will be empty again ... 'll have to reset the MAC ...
must recover the lost root password ... oh Lord ( no, not you Steve ... )
