Yes, that's my understanding of the spec. Grant Grundler does not agree and thinks that non-posting is the only compliant implementation. I wish he was right as it would be the easiest to deal with. We contacted Intel about the out-of-spec readl when writing to the PMCSR to change power state as they were the original author of the mmconfig code. Their solution was to remove the readl after confirming that mmconfig was non-posted on their chipsets.

I agree with you. Having the readl would be the safest and the most conservative approach. But it is out-of-spec to have a readl immediately following writel to the PMCSR when power state is changed. So should we have a relaxed version of pci_write_config_* with no flushing read for programming the PMCSR?
