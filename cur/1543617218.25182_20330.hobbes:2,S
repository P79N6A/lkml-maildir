	I agree in theory, but in practice the problem is the
connection setup. On IrDA, you need "someone" to perform the IAS query
on the right device with the right service name (if you are BlueTooth
oriented, think Inquiry + SDP query). If you look IrNET, the actual
data path is only 10% (or less) of the code, most of the code deal
with discovery and connection setup, and this is purely specific to
the PPP over IrDA solution.
	By the way, the virtual TTY is not that complex, it's more
complex in the case of IrNET because I actually use the TTY interface
for the control channel. If you remove the control channel, it's
pretty straightforward.

	Like IrNET. There may be way to hook on top of the socket API
from kernel space without modifications (by implementing the bottom
half of the socket layer).

	Did you measure those inefficiencies in practice ?
