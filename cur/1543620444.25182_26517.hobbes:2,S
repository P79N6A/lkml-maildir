Larry, I think this means you should change the default behavior of 'bk 
send' to ask the user what the hell they are smoking if they the patch to 
be sent is larger than say, oh 200k.
I got clobbered by this a couple of times trying to get someone to 'bk 
send' me a patch.
I got burned enough times to just decide never to use it again.
Either remove 'bk send' or at least warn us before we shoot off a foot.
Ideally, this should ask what changesets you want to send, and what 
public tree to look at to see *what* makes sense to send.
