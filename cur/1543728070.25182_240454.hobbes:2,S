Yes, I think I pointed out before, that not any code of the kernel,
but the hardware itself hangs during the reboot.

Right, in fact the problem occures from the first writing to the i8042
register.  When you comment out all of the lines sending a
"I8042_CMD_CTL_WCTR" from i8042.c the resulting kernel will reboot
under al conditions (at least it does here) -- but unfortunatly that
renders the local Keyboard unusable...
Putting only one of them back in, (for example the one in
i8042_activate_port(), which brings the keyboard back to life) the
reboot hangs again.
Big question:  how was the initialisation of the PS/2 ports managed in
2.4.x?  Ther seems to be no similar code to i8042.c in it[0], and all I
have found till now is a bunch ob obscure jump-rables in
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c ...
cheers

[0] In fact, the only code mentioning the i8042 in 2.4 is related to
    HP HIL devices...
