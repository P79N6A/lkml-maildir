Subject: [RFC][PATCH  3/14] Add the whiteout file type
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/14/72

From: Jan Blunck <j.blunck@tu-harburg.de>
Subject: Add the whiteout file type
A white-out stops the VFS from further lookups of the white-outs name and
returns -ENOENT. This is the same behaviour as if the filename isn't
found. This can be used in combination with union mounts to virtually
delete (white-out) files by creating a file with this file type.
