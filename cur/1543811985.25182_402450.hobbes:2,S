I think this is a bug in asus_acpi.c and sony_acpi.c.  They assume
that their devices can not be hot-plugged, so if they aren't found
at the time of acpi_bus_register_driver(), they can discard the
.add() methods.
It is true that these particular devices can't be hot-plugged, but
there's no way to tell that to acpi_bus_register_driver(), so we have
to assume .add() could be called as long as the driver remains
registered.
I'll cook up a patch for asus_acpi.c and sony_acpi.c.  Thanks for
finding this.
