Taking your advice I removed the header memory.h and switched the
include for string.h to be linux/string.h.  This seemed to fix the
problem.  I thank you all for your input and appreciate the time you all
took
Michael

Inside a driver (or module) file, any include reference that doesn't
begin with
either <linux/foo.h> or <asm/foo.h> should always raise a red flag.
There are
user-land header files ("/usr/include") and kernel header files
("/usr/src/linux/include") and never the twain shall meet.
Mixing includes is always a bad idea.
