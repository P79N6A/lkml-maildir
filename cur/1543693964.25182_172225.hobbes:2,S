This seems almost trivial.  If the vacuum job runs too much,
overusing disk bandwith - throttle it!
This is easier than trying to tell the kernel that the job is
less important, that goes wrong wether the job runs too much
or too little.  Let that job  sleep a little when its services
aren't needed, or when you need the disk bandwith elsewhere.
