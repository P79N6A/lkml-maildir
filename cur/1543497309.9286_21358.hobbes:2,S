This is not a valid assumption, and there is 1 good example for that:
Y2K...
The idea that 32 bit will be obsolete is probably non-true. We are still
using 4 and 8 bit microcontrollers. By then a lot of 32 bit
microcontrollers will be common in regular appliances. Those appliances
will by then be more complex, and therefore need a base that already has
no time problems.
I can see the logica with the amount of users on a 32 bit system, but not
with the time. 38 years is not that long, and I know that there still will
be a lot of 32 bit controllers out there (and even 8 and 4 bit...)
