Because you asked ;-)
I too am not particularly fond of it, for much the same reasons you
mentioned.
While I think its good to reduce the number of random kernel threads,
I'm afraid this isn't a good way to do so.
Why does everybody and his pony create their own workqueue, is that
really because it deadlocks with keventd, or are there other reasons, if
so, which, and can we solve those?
