Currently they are visible, but it's considered opaque and really isn't
of use to anything other than administrative tools (for the local
system).

Joinable pags is a purely administrative function, used by almost nobody
right now except for a few esoteric system admin functions on select
installations, certainly nothing in a normal install/setup.
If that capability is objectionable (most people didn't even realize it
was possible currently, and at that, only for root/suid=0 procs)

And more importantly - that behavior is totally expected across ALL
on-the-same-system activities by AFS users. We expect that we're not
going to get new pags assigned except at explicit request or expected
times, and that includes copying tokens/tickets/etc. 
If I run a subshell/suid app/etc. and klog/kinit to get new
tokens/keys/whatever, I expect that those keys will be available to the
parent process and all other processes in that same pag. If I don't want
this behavior, I'll request a new pag before starting the
subshell/app/whatever. AFS cmd line tools make this real easy "pagsh
cmd". 
It would be best if y'all would avoid trying to combine the issue of
PAGs with the issue of auth/key/token/ticket data in the kernel. They
are orthogonal to each other. 
I've also seen numerous mentions of the fact that afs can only deal with
a single token per cell per pag. This shouldn't be of issue to the PAG
discussion at all - it's up to the individual filesystem to handle how
it accepts token data into the kernel. The only thing that is decided
for it is what PAG the data is associated with.
Additionally - why all this worry/concern about sharing keys. Yuck. If
we want multiple separate pags authenticated to the same entity, we'll
just insert the tokens more than once from user space. No reason to
concern the kernel with that.
