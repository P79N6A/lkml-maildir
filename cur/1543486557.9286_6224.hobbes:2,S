Subject: 2.2.2-pre4 - lots of hanging processes.

I'm running 2.2.2-pre4 SMP on a dual processor PPro box.  I compiled the
kernel with egcs-1.1.1 release, and used -march=pentiumpro and
-mcpu=pentiumpro - being a little adventurous, I realize.
Anyways, after being up only for a few hours today, many processes started
hanging in the "D" state - uninterruptable sleep.  I managed to get a "ps
axl" in before the machine became completely unusable, but the file I
dumped it to got eaten by fsck.  (As I couldn't cleanly reboot and sync
hung too :-()
Anyways, I know this is not enough detail to be useful but as it's a
"testing" kernel I felt I should report it.
Later,
	Dale
