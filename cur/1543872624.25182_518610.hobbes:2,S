I've tested -mm2 against -mm2+noyield and -mm2+rsdl+noyield. The
noyield patch simply makes the sched_yield syscall return immediately.
Xorg and all tests are run at nice 0.
Loads:
 memload: constant memcpy of 16MB buffer
 execload: constant re-exec of a trivial shell script
 forkload: constant fork and exit of a trivial shell script
 make -j 5: hot-cache kernel build without ccache
 make -j 5 ccache: hot-cache kernel build with ccache
Tests:
 beryl - 3D window manager, wiggle windows, spin desktop, etc.
 galeon - web browser, rapidly scrolling long web pages by grabbing
    the scroll bar
 mp3 - XMMS on a FUSE sshfs over wireless (during all tests)
 terminal - responsiveness of ssh and local terminal sessions
 mouse - responsiveness of mouse pointer
Results:
 great = completely smooth
 good = fully responsive
 ok = visible latency
 bad = becomes difficult to use (or mp3 skips)
 awful = make it stop, please

There's a substantial performance hit for not yield, so we probably
want to investigate alternate semantics for it. It seems reasonable
for apps to say "let me not hog the CPU" without completely expiring
them. Imagine you're in the front of the line (aka queue) and you
spend a moment fumbling for your wallet. The polite thing to do is to
let the next guy in front. But with the current sched_yield, you go
all the way to the back of the line.
RSDL makes most of the noyield hit back in normal make and then some
with ccache. Impressive. But ccache is still destroying interactivity
somehow. The ccache effect is fairly visible even with non-parallel
'make'.
Also note I could occassionally trigger nasty multi-second pauses with
-mm2+noyield under exectest that didn't show up elsewhere. That's
probably a bug in the mainline scheduler.
