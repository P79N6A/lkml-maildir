Close, but no cookie.
Indeed, the problem is not the new arch/i386/kernel code.
The kernel was more or less1024kb large (can't remember the exact number), 
and my loadlin can't seem to handle that.
Might be nice to change the current error message from "Kernel isn't usable 
on boot floppies" [or words to that effect] to "Kernel isn't usable with 
loadlin, as usually seen on boot floppies"...
As to why backing a patch that doesn't get compiled in would change kernel 
size... I'm not sure I want to know.
[The fix was to modularize a couple more things]
