Yes.  I've seen this, and sorta tracked it down.  It used to be (in 2.0)
that you could delete a proxy arp entry without specifying the 'dev' in
the apr_req struct for the ioctl.  Now you have to, and ppp 2.3.5 doesn't
do it.  I couldn't find a valid email for the maintainer for ppp, so it's
unlikely to get fixed :-(, and I don't think changing the kernel to
support the old method looks possible, at least from my minimal
understanding of the code.
Note: the entry can be deleted using the 'arp' util. from net-tools, just
be sure to give the '-i <interface>' option.
