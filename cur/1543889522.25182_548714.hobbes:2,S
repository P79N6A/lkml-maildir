Yeah, but the interesting one is this pair:
  events/0      R running     0     4      1 (L-TLB)
  sleep.sh      D 0000014F     0  5798   5789 (NOTLB)

ie we have a deadlock because resume wants to do that firmware request,
but the event daemon is apparently spinning like mad. 
And yes, request_firmware() has a "loading_timeout" in seconds.  And
it's 60. So that explains your pause right there!
It might be some unfortunate interaction with process freezing (my
favorite whipping boy), but it could also be something else.  I suspect
we should treat suspend/resume as a bootup event, and not allow execve()
for that case at all. Right now we have:
        retval = -EPERM;
        if (current->fs->root)
                retval = kernel_execve(sub_info->path,
                                sub_info->argv, sub_info->envp);
in kernel/kmod.c, and that "current->fs->root" thing basically protects
us from trying to run a user-mode helper early in the boot sequence, but
we might want to add a conditional like "&& !resuming" to that test..
