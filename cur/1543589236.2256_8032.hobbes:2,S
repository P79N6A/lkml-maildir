perhaps the best way would be to do this updating in the sending code
itself.
first there would be a 'current time thread', which updates a global
shared variable that shows the current time. (ie. no extra system-call is
needed to access current time.) If the header-sending code detects that
current time is not equal to the timestamp stored in the header itself,
then the header is reconstructed. Pretty simple.
