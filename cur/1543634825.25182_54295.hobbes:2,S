I'm no expert on this bit but look in
drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c for CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN 
#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
static int max_scsi_luns = 8;
#else
static int max_scsi_luns = 1;
#endif
This is the variable you seem to want.
Note to SCSI maintainers.  a quick vi `grep -l CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN`
here reveals lots of hardcoded values of 8.  It seems to me
that perhaps a CONFIG_SCSI_MAX_LUN to replace
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN would be in order.
I know Alan and others are planning to do major cleanup of
the scsi subsystem (hopefully after IDE stablizes?)
