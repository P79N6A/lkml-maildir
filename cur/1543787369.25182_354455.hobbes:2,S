This is *WRONG*.  (see below)
And it doesn't "achieve" this.  Stop the FUD.
There is a _reason_ why it is the way it is.

Jeff,
There is a _reason_ why technical people separate concepts
in _layers_.
There is a _reason_ why technical people use Object Oriented
Paradigms describing models and design.
Do you know _what_ that reason is?
Or should I leave you to "demonstrate with code"?
Seeing that you keep _persisting_ in your ways,
I'll leave it for you to "enrich" Linux SCSI in
your "demonstrate with code".
