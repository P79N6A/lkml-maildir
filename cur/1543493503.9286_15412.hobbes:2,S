Dear Colleagues
In my "trip" around the kernel :-)...I found a new problem now :-).
I created a system call and used the steps below:
1- In the file "/asm/unistd.h"
  I added the system call by the following command
    "#define __NR_setdeadline      164"
2- In the file "arch/i386/kernel/entry.S"
   I added ...
      ".long SYMBOL_NAME(sys_setdeadline)   /* 164 */"
   and the file follows with...
      ".long 0,0
       .long SYMBOL_NAME(sys_vm86)"   
   and in the last row I updated from 166 to 167 ...
      ".space (NR_syscalls-167)*4"
3- In the file "kernel/sys.c"
   I defined the system call setdeadline.
4- After the above steps I created a file in C which uses the system call setdeadline. In that file I used 
    "systcall3 (int, setdeadline, int, which, int, who, float, deadline)".
   It is beacause setdeadline has three parameters.
   I also used in the headers : "<linux/unistd.h>".
After the algorithm showed :-) ... The kernel was recompiled and the machine rebooted.
Therefore would be possible to test the system call...
I compiled my C file and I got the following message:
 " In function 'setdeadline':
   __NR_setdeadline undeclared (first use this function)"
What is the matter ??
I could not understand why I need to use "syscall3".
If I have another system with two, one or other value different from three. How I must proceed ??
The used procedure is in the book:
   "The Linux Kernel book "
    Remy Card, Eric Dumas and Franc Mevel.
Thank you again.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
