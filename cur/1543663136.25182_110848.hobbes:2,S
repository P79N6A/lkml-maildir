The reason you cannot write to an NTFS partition is we just haven't had time
to write the code. All the NTFS developers (including myself) are very busy.
Once we get some free time, we will be working hard on it. We understand most
of the NTFS filesystem, so thats not the problem. It's just a lack of free 
time.
