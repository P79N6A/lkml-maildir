So merge it as it is and move the stuff to the VFS as needed or
deemed necessary. And enable the pseudo interface, or at least
set it in menuconfig and enable by default, it needs testing too.
Then someone says "we can't implement this in the fs" and someone
else says "we can't implement this in the vfs" and someone else
says "this is a good thing which we want but you won't let us"
and we stagnate again...
Isn't this bickering getting a bit old?
After all, it seems the code is merged in -mm, the big issues are fixed
and all should be ready for more real-life testing and such?
