Does not work. Setfont still only changes tty it is run on.
There are more problems. Emacs changes cursor to "more visible" one,
this somehow leaks between ttys.
Last but not least: Try this on your tty:
echo -e "\33[10;5000]\33[11;50]\33[?18;0;136c\33[?102m"
It is supposed to start "softcursor". Unfortunately, with 2.5.68+
softcursor is not cleared properly. Try typing foo^H^H^H in bash
:-(. [Or try most /some/file].
