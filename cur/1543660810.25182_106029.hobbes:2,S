My knowledge of TCP/IP is extremely minimal but the sequence number looked
weird when the stall occurred.  It looked like the sequence numbers you get
with the -S option to tcpdump.  All of the other packets had small sequence
numbers and what I assume was the bad packet had a large one.
I'm sorry if this is gibberish and makes no sense.  I don't know how to tell
if the checksum was wrong or not.
