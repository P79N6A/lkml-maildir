Hi -
Attached is cleanup/rewrite patch for scsi_scan.c against 2.5.30.
The only functional change is adding support for BFLAGS_LARGELUN,
it was defined before, but not used, otherwise the code should be
the functional equivalent of the pre-patch version.
The unused BFLAGS_NODISK was removed.
Tested with:
qla2300, v6 beta drivers modified for 2.5.x, with FCP switch attached
	IBM 3542 (multi-LUN FC disk array, supports REPORT LUN)
	SEAGATE ST118273 (FC disk drive)
serveRAID (ips driver, boot device)
AIC Adaptec 7896 with IBM-PSG ST318203LC (boot disk)
ISP1020 (qlogicisp driver) with Quantum DLT7000 tape drive attached
