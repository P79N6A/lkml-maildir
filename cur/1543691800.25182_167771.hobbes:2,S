How expensive is it to take the trap and do a fix up, compared to
making an aligned copy?  As it involves raising and handling a fault
disassembling the instruction that caused the fault, etc., I'd be
surprised if it's much less than 1000 cycles, even without the printk,
although I haven't measured it yet, and can't find enough info in the
architecture manuals to know what it is.
Even if it's only 500 cycles, you can copy and realign a large packet
in that time.
