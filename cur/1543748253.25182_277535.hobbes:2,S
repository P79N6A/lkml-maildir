The one time you would need this ITR crap is when you are running low
traffic (relatively speaking: which could mean anything below 100Kpps
depending on h/ware). NAPI will consume a little more CPU
otherwise - given it does an extra IO (if it kicks in and out on every
packet or two). Granted you are doing some new types of tests, so
you may be seeing some things we havent experienced before.
Can you put a printk in ->open() of e1000 with
#if napi is defined
printk("%s: NAPI is on\n",dev->name);
#endif
This should print on ifconfig up and indicate whether NAPI is on or not.
cheers,
