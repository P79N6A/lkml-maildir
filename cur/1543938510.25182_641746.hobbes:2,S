Subject: [PATCH rc8-mm1] hotfix libata-scsi corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.6.24-rc8-mm1 is corrupting.  smartd does some sg_ioctl into its stack,
and depending on how its stack randomization worked out, this is liable
to end up writing into the adjacent physical page too.  If you're lucky
you have highmem, and ioread16_rep oopses on the virtual address beyond
what ata_pio_sector's kmap_atomic set up; when you're unlucky, it'll go
ahead and corrupt the next page more obscurely.
Bisect led to scsi-misc-2.6.git's 465ff3185e0cb76d46137335a4d21d0d9d3ac8a2
[SCSI] relax scsi dma alignment, and the patch below is good for a hot-fix.
Though I doubt it'll be the final fix, since it appears to undo the whole
point of blk_queue_update_dma_alignment: perhaps libata is at fault to be
going through sectory code for unsectory I/O - I wouldn't know.
