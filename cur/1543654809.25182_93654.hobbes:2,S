Subject: Compile errors in 2.5.50 (bttv, mpu401, fb)

Hi all:
I tried 2.5.50 yesterday and encountered three compile errors. One of them
(bttv-driver) was already discussed here, I know nothing about the other
two.
Sorry if it was already reported, I do not read the mailing list very
carefuly. :-)
Also sorry that I have no time now to make patches. And, in fact, I am not
able to do so (excpet the second one VERY SIMPLE case), since I do not
know what the source should be.
1) drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c - AUDC_CONFIG_PINNACLE constant
- already known and patched!
2) sound/oss/mpu401.h - line #10
return type of the function is void in the header but should be int
according the actual source file
3) include/video/fbcon.h - line #666 (and neighbouring)
non-existant members of struct display are referenced
Good luck...
