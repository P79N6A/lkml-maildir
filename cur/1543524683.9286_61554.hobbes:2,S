Linux goes against, because the Linux network folk either did not
read Stevens' books or read them not enough carefully. 8)
Actually, the feature did appear in 2.3, _BUT_ it was eaten only because
I honestly believed, that it is used only by a few of marginal applications,
sort of port scanners from bugtraq archives.
Shortly, the feature is useful, but only provided nobody uses it. 8)8)
This paradoxical conclusion explains why sleeping forever in linux-2.2
is not a bug really. Correct applications do not suffer.
