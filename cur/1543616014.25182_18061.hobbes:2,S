One little problem I have with driverfs (and with the whole "everything
is a filesystem" idea) is that the infrastructure just isn't ready for
it yet.
For example, driverfs_create_dir().  That has no driverfs-specific
content at all.  It's 100% mucking with VFS internals.
The more cut-n-paste-filesystems we create, the harder it all gets
to maintain.  We need a library layer which simplifies and abstracts
these operations.  (Says me, looking at you-know-who :)
