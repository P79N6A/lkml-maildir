The thing is, the correct fix is to make uml (and other architectures) use 
the direct makefile approach (ie "make -f xxxxx/Makefile" instead of "make 
-C xxxxx").
All the dependencies are generated with relative paths anyway, so this 
one-liner makes the tree build, but it means that the dependencies are 
broken for uml-specific subdirectories anyway.
