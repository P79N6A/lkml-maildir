Pavel, what are you talking about?
On a POSIX-model capabilities system, uid=123 has NO SPECIAL MEANING.
gid=456 has NO SPECIAL MEANING.  UIDs and GIDs are ONLY meaningful in
checking access permissions of files (read, write, execute).
"Bind-low-port" is not a property of a UID or GID.  It is a property of
either a FILE (a program-in-storage) or of a TASK (a
program-in-execution).
A program can aquire the "bind-low-port" either by having that cap set in
its "fP" set, or by acquiring it explicitly through the cap_set_proc()
interface.
And there is no such thing as root (TINSTAR), unless it is Robert Oot's
login name.  uid 0 is, from a security and capabilities standpoint,
no different than uid 16053.
If your program wants bind-low-port, then either the administrative system
(with CAP_SETFCAP) needs to set the appropriate bit in the file's fP set,
or the program itself needs to call cap_set_proc(), the results of which
are determined by an anal-retenetive access control system.
