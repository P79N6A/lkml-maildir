   no ! the right thing to do is to remove 'nis', 'nisplus' and
   'nis+' from your /etc/nsswitch.conf if you don't have a nis-server around.
   this was discussed before !
I agree.  I think it's ludicrious to recommend that someone to add
fake and useless usernames to groups/passwd or even worse to upgrade
to a beta version of glibc to fix this problem.  I especially don't
expect it from the glibc maintainer himself.
Later,
