A few additional ones are fine - especially for "core" stuff like inode.c 
I don't see any problem at all.
And keeping EXPORT_SYMBOL close to the place that defines it makes some 
things clearer. I would certainly not mind moving some of the 
kernel/ksym.c stuff out to the places that actually define the functions.
If it becomes an issue where _most_ files in export symbols, our build 
times will suck, but fs/inode.c is certainly central enough that I don't 
find any problem with it.
