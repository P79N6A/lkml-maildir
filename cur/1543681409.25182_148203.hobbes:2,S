I think that'll break even on some x86 boxes if we used get_cycles. I do 
wonder however why we need that lock, i see x86/64 uses seqlock at least. 
Although i can't vouch for whether that would have an adverse affect here. 
I presume Stultz would know.

No one else appears to have monotonic_clock, this would break every other 
arch out there.
