Pros of a 64-bit opaque user pointer:
- Simpler programming for userland.
- Fewer cache misses, because there is no need for accessing part of a 
separate and large fd->pointer table in userland before being able to 
act upon event notification (some implementations can get around this, 
but it's very common practice).
Cons:
- 4 bytes memory wastage on 32-bit platforms per struct.  Note that it 
is not the full 8, because userland needs to have that table of pointers 
anyway.
Notes:
- No memory wastage for nontrivial applications on 64-bit platforms.
