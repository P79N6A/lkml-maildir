Yes, this assumes that vfork called by a kernel thread will usually wait
only until the vfork child exec's (and not until the child exit's).
That wait should be very short and hence we can wait for vfork parent as
well.
The advanatge of this is we let kernel threads get to freeze at a place of 
their choice (rather than in some common code like do_fork).

Yes, agreed.
