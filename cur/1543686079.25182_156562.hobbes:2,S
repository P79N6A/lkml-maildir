xmms is a RT process - it does not really have interactivity problems...
It will be extremely hard to fix this in a generic scheduler, instead
let xmms be the RT process it is with SCHED_SOFTRR (or whatever
it will be named).
Do this for arts, and other audio/video path applications.
Then start the race for interactivity tuning
 (X, X applications, console, login, etc)
interactivity = two-way

Listening to music is not interactive.
Changing equalization on a media playback need to be interactive in
two ways.
1) The slider should move in the GUI.
2) The volume should change, but the big buffers needed in todays audio path
   will delay the audible changes...
Note: audio path starvation is not one of them...
