Operating systems cannot make more memory appear by magic.
The question is really about the best strategy for dealing with low memory. In my
opinion, the OS should not try to out-think physical limitations. Instead, the OS 
should take as little space as possible and provide the ability for user level 
clever management of space. In a truly embedded system, there can easily be a user level
root process that watches memory usage and prevents DOS attacks -- if the OS provides
settable enforced quotas etc.
