Ugh. Ok, I think I've found the issue.
The systems I'm testing w/ all use the ACPI PM timer for the
clocksource. On a whim I forced the TSC to be used and the hang went
away.
It appears the issue is that the ACPI PM wraps every ~5 seconds.  Since
the test takes longer the 5 seconds to run, the
timeofday_periodic_hook() function gets starved and we never accumulate
time. Then as the counter wraps, time starts wrapping thus timers do not
expire and the test never completes, effectively hanging the box.
I believe this issue was hit before back when cycle_t was 32bits long,
thus causing the TSC to wrap every ~4seconds on a 1Ghz box.
So whats the solution here? Do we need to do something to
timeofday_periodic_hook is guaranteed to run with some frequency? Or is
the test just bunk because realtime threads must give up the cpu in
order for the kernel to function?
Thoughts?
