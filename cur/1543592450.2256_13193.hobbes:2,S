Subject: Unable to open an initial console (on SMP machine)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/5/26/32

starting with kernels 2.4.5-preX I get this at startup:
	Warning: unable to open an initial console.
then none of the /dev/vcs* /dev/tty* doesn't work.
then i get this in syslog:
	May 26 16:10:19 www modprobe: modprobe: Can't open dependencies file /lib/modules/2.4.5/modules.dep (No such file or directory)
	May 26 16:10:19 www /sbin/agetty[383]: /dev/tty5: cannot open as standard input: No such device
lucky me that this machine is a network server and most (all) of the
administrative tasks are done via SSH ...
I attache the .config file and the dmesg results and the /proc/pci file  ...
i don't understand what is WORNG ... it worked BEFORE ...
i have " Virtual terminal " and "Support for console on virtual
terminal "  enabled ...
anybody has any idea ?
also i see an "WARNING: unexpected IO-APIC, please mail" ... can this be
the problem ?!? 
Best regards,
