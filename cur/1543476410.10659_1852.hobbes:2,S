I'll bet you have clock skew. This is a classic example of what happens
when the clock on the server is ahead of the clock on the client. You
modify the file on the client, but it gets it's timestamp from server. So
now you do an ls, but the file's timestamp is in the future, which causes
the 'ls' on most Unices to drop the time oart of the time stamp.
