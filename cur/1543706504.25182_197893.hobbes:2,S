[ personally I'd say screw the un-portable architectures ;) ]
Long long is here to stay.
Besides if a linux architecture utilises long long in the kernel and 
doesn't support it in printf via %lld then it's horked.
printf/libc should be fixed instead.
Maybe that's the problem - the libc support fragment in the kernel tree is 
not up to date on that architecture - maybe the fixes should applied there 
instead - instead of trying to work around the problem, fix the cause.
Cheers,
MaZe.
