This was the error:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu71: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
I compiled linux-2.4.21-0.13mdk kernel..
However, the kde version of linuxconfig worked flawlessly, while i tried 
"mneuconfig" a couple of times and when trying to access "Linux Advanced 
Sound Architecture" it gave this error..
Hope i could help..
