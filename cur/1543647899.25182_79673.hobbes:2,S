Well, given the previous commentary I would have expected the hook to have
already existed, and if it had we would have changed to conform to it
months ago.

No disagreement (on that). Do you propose we orphan old versions?  (Which
isn't to say "Yes" is a wrong answer)
Also, we're not ready for 1.3 yet. RedHat 8.0's kernel sort of forced the
issue sooner than we would have liked to have dealt with this, and
actually causes another problem; It means the "extra groups" encoding for
PAGs breaks. That's certainly not the end of the world, but the obvious
solution is a Linux Security Module, and at least as yet that's not in
their kernel.
