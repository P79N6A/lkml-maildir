A number of S3 cards lie about their PCI memory usage, and actually decode
twice as much memory (an extra bit) than the BIOS thinks they do.  This
is worked around by Windows 95 drivers which go and muck with PCI bus
allocations at driver load time.  
This has caused us no end of problems with our hardware under Windows NT,
which like Linux tends not to touch the BIOS allocation.  Our standard
support solution is to swap cards in the bus to cause the S3 card to be
enumerated either first or last (I forget - it's late...) so that the 
invisible upper half of its address space doesn't step on any other PCI
allocations.
