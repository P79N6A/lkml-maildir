Surely the CMOS battery?? Seriously, no battery here anywhere ;)
Anyway, I was already afraid that I didn't have any of my *two* different
power measurement devices here, but  then I found one in the drawer
(Conrad EKM 265, to be precise).
The results are (waited for values to settle down each time):
-dyntick4, C1, CONFIG_NO_HZ:
     83.9W KDE idle, 95.2W bash while 1
-dyntick4, C2 (C1-only hack disabled, kernel rebuilt), CONFIG_NO_HZ off:
     84.4W KDE idle, 95.4W bash while 1
-dyntick4, acpi=off (i.e. APM active), -dynticks:
     85.5W KDE idle, 95.5W bash while 1
Bet you didn't see this coming...
Again, this is Athlon 1200 *desktop*, with some EPOX VIA motherboard
("8K5A3+" ??).
Note that even with dynticks disabled did I have a pause on boot where I had
to fiddle with the keyboard once to continue booting, IOW our APIC timer
probing disrupts normal interrupt processing due to C2 -> C3 AMD BIOS bug.
We might want to fix probing to not require manual generation of the next
interrupt event due to APIC timer temporarily being "dead".

Indeed, we need a good and flexible fallback mechanism.
However I would slightly slant dynticks towards being active even in cases
where it actually happens to consume *slightly* more power due to C2 disabled,
since it *seems* that CPU load is lower with dynticks
(less timer background load) / desktop timing is slightly more precise.
And we all want fast desktops that are waaaaay better than XP, right?
