Have you looked at Stellation at all?  I know the
code itself is Java but they have some neat ideas about
being able to take 'slices' across the repository and
treat the slice as a single file for things like revision
tracking.  In some ways this is like a changeset; I could
see wanting to track revisions this way, for example:
  1. Changeset 'fix broken ptrace' gets applied
  2. Other stuff gets changed
  3. Changeset 'fix fix broken ptrace' is applied
I would want to be able to treat 1 and 3 as a single
changeset with two revision levels.
