Subject: 2.4.23-pre4 problems on i686 (net drivers, dri)

Apologies if this is already known, I'm not following this list closely
at the moment.  I've just tried -pre4 on an i686, with the following
results:
1. depmod reports missing symbols (crc32_le and bitreverse) for 8139cp,
8139too, fealnx, tulip, via-rhine, winbond849.  I'm willing to believe
the config tools have let me not select something here.  Fortunately, my
current nic on this box is natsemi, which is working.
2. I thought the changes for XFree-4.3 dri were in by now, but the
options in menuconfig seemed a bit vague on this.  I know other arches
are having problems, but I thought x86 was ok so I gave it a go using
radeon.o - bad news, if my XF86Config tells it to load module "dri" it
locks the box solid.
The card is a radeon-7500ish, my XF86Config and this part of the .config
haven't changed for some time, I've been used to building X's radeon.o
if I wanted dri to work.
.config has
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_NEW=y
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
Suggestions welcome, other info on request.
Ken
