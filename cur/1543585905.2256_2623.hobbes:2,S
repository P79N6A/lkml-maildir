Are there any architectures that are simple (sane) to implement sftw on? 
The i386 is plagued by it's 16-bit (arguably its 8 or even 4 bit) past. 
The HP-PARISC has its brokenness, PPC isn't that great either from what 
I've heard. And the list goes on.
Now I will I admit that I am likely wrong, and can expect some flamage 
for this. This is intended as a curiousity about something decent.
This can include architectures like the IA64 & the upcoming x86-64. Just 
looking for something with lots of GPR's, sane MM support, etc.
