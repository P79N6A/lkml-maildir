Because USER_HZ is there only because HZ changes on various systems and
we don't want to break userland apps that assume its value.

But you don't really want to know HZ, you want to know timer resolution.
That's a reasonable request and I believe the posix-timers
clock_getres() interface might provide what you need. Although I'd defer
to George (CC'ed) since he's more of an expert on those interfaces.
You might also want to check out his HRT patches.
