Hi!
Console colors are completely messed up (read: black, I even suspect
the font to be corrupt somehow) if switching back to console mode
from X (either by quitting or ctrl-alt-fX) in recent 2.4.0-textXX
kernels. 2.2.XX do work just fine. Is this a known problem with a
known fix?
Setup: standard VGA console, nothing special. ATI Mach64 Xserver which
is fine with 2.2.XX
Richard.
