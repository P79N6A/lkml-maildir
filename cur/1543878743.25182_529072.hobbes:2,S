Well, in this case, it has already been determined that switching
to a different Linux I/O scheduler gives back most of the performance.
But the drive can do readahead better than the OS:  With the OS,
everything is broken up into discrete requests, whereas with the 
drive firmware, it can continuously update it's readahead projections,
even in the midst of a command.  So it does have an advantage.
But again, only the WD Raptor seems to have serious problems here.
Other drives cope well with readahead + NCQ just fine.
