XP came with an option that I've seen on USB hard drives where it won't
cache writes by default.  It is in Device Manager, and called Optimize
for quick removal.  You can also enable write caching, which requires
the use of the Safe Removal icon.
I don't recall 2000 having this option.
With Linux, I'm just ingrained to umount first.

Nope, when I put stuff onto a CF card via CF-to-USB adapter Windows 
still buffers writes to the media while the user interface goes on about
its business. The only media that I've ever seen Windows use 
synchronously is old-style floppy disks.
