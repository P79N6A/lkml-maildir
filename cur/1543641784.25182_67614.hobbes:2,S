Check on the website and you'll see that there have been two upgrades. The -ck5
patch now includes the -aa vm changes by default, and the hang on shutdown (due
to swapoff failing) has been fixed. For the record, the ck5 patch is the last
one until a new compressed cache patch becomes available for 2.4.19 and I will
merge that to make a -ck6 patch. The ck5 patch has proven to be very stable and
I am satisfied that it needs no further changes till the compressed cache patch
becomes available, so I recommend you upgrade to that.

Con Kolivas.
