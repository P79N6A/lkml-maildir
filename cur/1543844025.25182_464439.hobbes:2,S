On the contrary I'm really trying my best to be reasonable.
If there were no way around implementing kprobes, I would completely agree 
with you.
Let's take an item from todo list: TLS support for m68k. This a language 
feature becoming more and more important and increasingly difficult to 
work around it. Considering the complexities of this feature it will take 
quite a bit of the time available to me and somehow I doubt someone will 
beat me to it. I'm not complaining about it, I even enjoy hacking on it, 
but I also have to take no shit on how I have to spend my time.
Considering this I hope you understand how important kprobes are to me, I 
admit it's a nice a feature, but it's far from being essential.
bye, Roman
