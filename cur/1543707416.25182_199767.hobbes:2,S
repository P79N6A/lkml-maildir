Not all arches need all functions, and that's where the weak functions
come in.  We could remove some of them (the *gdb*regs* type ones) as
being absolutely required, but not everyone needs kgdb_arch_init.
Similarly for kgdb_flush_io.

Tomorrow I leave for FOSDEM, and won't have time to pick on KGDB until I
get back Tuesday.  What I'm going to do then, if no one beats me to it,
is to merge stuff I've got into Amit's patches (the CVS versions off of
sourceforge), except for netpoll-specific portions of the kgdboe patch.
