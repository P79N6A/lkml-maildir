Perhaps it should be split up into three cases:
	- producer/consumer pinned to the same CPU
	- producer/consumer pinned to different CPUs
	- producer/consumer lefter under control of the scheduler
The first two would let us observe any changes in the actual pipe
code, whereas the 3rd case would tell us which case the scheduler is
leaning towards (or if it starts doing something real crazy, like
reschedule the tasks on different CPUs each time, we'd see a bandwith
lower than case 2 and that should ring alarm bells).
