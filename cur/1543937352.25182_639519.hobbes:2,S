Linus, if possible, I'd suggest this patch be merged for 2.6.24.
It's a safer version of the reverted patch. It was tested on
ext2/ext3/jfs/xfs/reiserfs and won't 100% iowait even without the
other bug fixing patches.

writeback: speed up writeback of big dirty files
After making dirty a 100M file, the normal behavior is to
start the writeback for all data after 30s delays. But
sometimes the following happens instead:
	- after 30s:    ~4M
	- after 5s:     ~4M
	- after 5s:     all remaining 92M
Some analyze shows that the internal io dispatch queues goes like this:
		s_io            s_more_io
		-------------------------
	1)	100M,1K         0
	2)	1K              96M
	3)	0               96M
1) initial state with a 100M file and a 1K file
2) 4M written, nr_to_write <= 0, so write more
3) 1K written, nr_to_write > 0, no more writes(BUG)
nr_to_write > 0 in (3) fools the upper layer to think that data have all been
written out. The big dirty file is actually still sitting in s_more_io. We
cannot simply splice s_more_io back to s_io as soon as s_io becomes empty, and
let the loop in generic_sync_sb_inodes() continue: this may starve newly
expired inodes in s_dirty.  It is also not an option to draw inodes from both
s_more_io and s_dirty, an let the loop go on: this might lead to live locks,
and might also starve other superblocks in sync time(well kupdate may still
starve some superblocks, that's another bug).
We have to return when a full scan of s_io completes. So nr_to_write > 0 does
not necessarily mean that "all data are written". This patch introduces a flag
writeback_control.more_io to indicate that more io should be done. With it the
big dirty file no longer has to wait for the next kupdate invocation 5s later.
In sync_sb_inodes() we only set more_io on super_blocks we actually visited.
This aviods the interaction between two pdflush deamons.
Also in __sync_single_inode() we don't blindly keep requeuing the io if the
filesystem cannot progress. Failing to do so may lead to 100% iowait.
