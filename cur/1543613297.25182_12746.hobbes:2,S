I have the same deadlock problem like you with the same VIA-chipset, my
Laptop is a gericom hydrospeed. I can reproduce it by mounting a cd in the
cd-drive. (My kernel is a 2.4.16 with ide-cd modules)
Steps to generate a deadlock on my notebook:
1. mount a normal cd
2. unmount the cd-drive
3. make a apm --suspend
4. wake up the laptop
5. try to remount the cd
6. the laptop get immediately lockt!
Please try out this, i think it could be the same problem?
