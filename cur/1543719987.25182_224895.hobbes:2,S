	Jeff, I'm amazed that you are so obsessed with this. Yes,
Wireless Extension could be improved in millions ways, but at least
it's working, whereas there are so many other areas where we have
nothing at all. If you talk with most people developping wireless
drivers, this doesn't even make their list. But I guess every one of
us need to have his hot topic ;-)
	I believe most people are concerned about :
	o WPA support (and security API in general)
	o SNAP encapsulation/decapsualtion in kernel
	o handling 802.11 frames natively in kernel
	o handling 802.11 management in kernel (association/deassociation, ...)
	Personally, those are my priorities :
	o getting more wireless drivers in the kernel
	o RtNetlink API for Wireless Extensions
	I also explained you how you could wrap around Wireless
Extension trivially to introduce a new driver API without breaking the
many user space tools, so that you can implement your proposal with
maximum backward compatibility. Just because there is one aspect of
the API you don't like, we don't need to throw away the good parts.
	Have fun...
	Jean
