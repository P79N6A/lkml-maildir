I just tried 2.5.61 and 2.5.61-mm1 on a dell inspiron 8100.
2.5.61 is working OK, but -mm1 hung as soon as it tried to exec init.
init=/bin/bash showed the same failure.
init(8) was able to print out it's first line, announcing its version
but then stopped.  with init=/bin/bash bash did not output anything.
