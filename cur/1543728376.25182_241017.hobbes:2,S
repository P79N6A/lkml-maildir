Subject: 2.6.7 capidrv: how to deactivate logging capidrv events to active console

Hi folks,
I have compiled kernel 2.6.7 with:
CONFIG_ISDN=y
CONFIG_ISDN_I4L=y
...
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI=y
# CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_AVMB1_VERBOSE_REASON is not set
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_MIDDLEWARE=y
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20=y
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPIFS_BOOL=y
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPIFS=y
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPIDRV=y
Then compiled the fritz-card kernel module from AVM.
Capi is working, and isdnlog too.
I need ISDN_I4L and ISDN_CAPI_CAPIDRV to get isdnlog working (for the 
/dev/isdnctrl device).
But with ISDN_CAPI_CAPIDRV and ISDN_I4L set, the kernel logs to the
active console whenever an event occurs on the isdn-line (e.g. someone
calls me).
Can I deactivate this logging somehow? I tried stopping klogd & syslogd, 
but that didn't help.
Or does anyone know another method of logging calls through the capi
interface?
Thank you,
Fabian
