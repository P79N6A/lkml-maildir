Hmm...you keep using the word "open".  What definition are you using? 
Because the new implementation is licensed under the GPL, which is an 
"Open Source" license.  By definition, this means that it is "open".
What I see you saying is that the interfaces are more restrictive than 
before.  This is true.
However, if you are confident that you are abiding by the terms of the 
GPL then there is nothing stopping you from patching the kernel to 
convert the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL to just EXPORT_SYMBOL.  The _GPL version 
is just a hint as to the intent/opinion of the designer.
The flip side of that is that using only items exported via 
EXPORT_SYMBOL doesn't make you automatically compliant to the GPL.  You 
could still be infringing if the module is legally considered a 
derivative work of the kernel.
