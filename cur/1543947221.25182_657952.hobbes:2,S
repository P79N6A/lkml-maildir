The check in setup_irq() very probably triggers for you:
               /*
                 * Can't share interrupts unless both agree to and are
                 * the same type (level, edge, polarity). So both flag
                 * fields must have IRQF_SHARED set and the bits which
                 * set the trigger type must match.
                 */
                if (!((old->flags & new->flags) & IRQF_SHARED) ||
                    ((old->flags ^ new->flags) & IRQF_TRIGGER_MASK)) {
                        old_name = old->name;
                        goto mismatch;
                }
