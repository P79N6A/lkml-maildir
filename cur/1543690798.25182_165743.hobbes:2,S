My comment referred to data from Intel and AMD code optimisation
guides.
The kernel only uses X86_ALIGNMENT_16 to derive two __ALIGN macros
for assembly code, but it doesn't use them except in one place in
the pnpbios code.
gcc -march=<cpu type> should generate appropriate alignment for
function entries and loop labels.
I suspect X86_ALIGNMENT_16 is a left-over from old code.
Perhaps its time to retire it.
