This is a problem we have in various filesystems.  Except for really
bad OOM situations the filesystem should never get a writeout request
for a single file.  We should really stop having ->writepage called by
the VM and move this kind of batching code into the VM.  I'm runnin into
similar issues for XFS and unwritten/delayed extent conversion once again.
