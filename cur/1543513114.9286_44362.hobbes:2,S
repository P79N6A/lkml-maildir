That's a good point.
However, if you do an IP takeover:
- The original machine is crashed and doesn't do ARP anymore, so my proposed
  patch wouldn't be able to output anything
- The original machine's web server let's say is down, but the rest of the
  system is still working fine. In this case, you should not take over the
  machine's IP just like this. 
  Either you:
  - tell the other machine to restart httpd
  - tell the other machine to shut down its interface, and then you take
    over its IP
Taking  over a  machine's IP  if its  interface is  still up  is asking  for
trouble and I believe  it's ok for the system to yell at  you if you do that
(one can always comment out the printk if really needed)
