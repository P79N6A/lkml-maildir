Hi,
a test user found a problem with mmiotrace (ported to x86/mm git tree).
The symbol 'init_mm' is undefined, but required when building the 32-bit
mmiotrace kernel module.

    x86: nuke a ton of unused exports
This commit removes EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_mm). Apparently mmiotrace requires
this symbol, but I do not know why. I do not use init_mm myself, so
apparently some function I call is inlined and requires it. Page table or
attribute handling stuff maybe?
Is it possible to simply put back this export or should I dig deeper into
why it seems to be required?
I can provide the simple patch to put it back in my next patch set, if
this is the right solution.
I will post the patch set after this issue is solved. In the mean time,
for the interested, the current patches are here:

Ps. I tested x86/mm version of mmiotrace on my 64-bit system and it seems
to work ok. I had to write a simple test module because I did not have any
drivers that a) called ioremap, b) were not broken on x86/mm, and c) I
had the hardware to actually use it. So this testing is very light.
