Not really, Tivo could simply sell you a box without any installed
software. The actual software is mailed to you on a credit card sized
ROM when you activate service. When they want to (or need to) update the
software they send out a new ROM card, maybe yearly as part of the
service subscription renewal.
The box could even be sold by third party vendors, I think they may even
have started off that way, my old Series 1 had a big Philips logo on it.
So now we make sure that this hardware refuses to boot any unsigned
code, but it wasn't shipped containing GPLv3 software, so it's license
terms simply does not apply.
The software is shipped on a ROM card which can no longer be modified by
the manufacturer or any third party, so it would seem to comply with the
GPLv3. I can even imagine that the hardware is really general purpose
but the ROM is encrypted so that only the BIOS/bootloader can unlock it.
So the GPLv3 seems to fall short on actually preventing tivoization. It
just requires an extra layer of indirection, ship hardware seperately
from software.
