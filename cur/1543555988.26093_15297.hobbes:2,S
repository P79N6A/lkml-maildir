Yes, both the shared file struct and the SCM_RIGHTS are not so easy to
account. I never said this is ready -- just work in progress. If you have
already done this, please let me know -- there is plenty of other things
to do and I don't wish to step on your toes.

it is not basic at all. The problems you point out are extremely complex
(at least the fd in transit issue, definitely is). 
So, yes it requires a bit more thought. I will come back when the issues
you pointed out are dealt with. Someone has added the 'files' field to the
'struct user_struct' so someone must have meant to put support for this
field to be something other than the meaningless 0 it currently is.
Regards,
Tigran
