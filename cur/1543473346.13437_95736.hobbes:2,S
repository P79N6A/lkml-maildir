I've j ust sent Alan a patch that fixes this - there's a missing '$'
in arch/i386/config.in that causes ALL of the problems mentioned in
this thread...
Alan: The problem line that matters is the one that reads:
 Q> if [ "CONFIG_MEM_SPECIAL" = "y" ]; then
There should be a $ after the first quote therein...
Best wishes from Riley.
