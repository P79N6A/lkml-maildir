It doesn't oops, it just doesn't register the devices so you can't open 
gettys on them. Other than that the kernel boots fine and you can log in 
over the network. Doing that you can see a couple of big difference in 
/dev:
2.5.28 without fix:
$ ls -l /dev/vc
total 0
crw-------    1 root     root       4,   0 Jan  1  1970 0
$ ls -l /dev/tty*
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       5,   0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/tty
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            4 Jul 25 14:17 /dev/tty0 -> vc/0
Whereas with the fix to add a call to con_init_devfs() near the end of 
vty_init() it all works and you can see the following:
ls -l /dev/vc
total 0
crw-------    1 root     root       4,   0 Jan  1  1970 0
crw-------    1 root     root       4,   1 Jul 25 14:09 1
crw-------    1 root     root       4,  10 Jan  1  1970 10
crw-------    1 root     root       4,  11 Jan  1  1970 11
etc...
crw-------    1 root     root       4,  63 Jan  1  1970 63
$ ls -l /dev/tty*
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       5,   0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/tty
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            4 Jul 25 14:25 /dev/tty0 -> vc/0
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            4 Jul 25 14:25 /dev/tty1 -> vc/1
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jul 25 14:25 /dev/tty10 -> vc/10
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jul 25 14:25 /dev/tty11 -> vc/11
etc...
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jul 25 14:25 /dev/tty63 -> vc/63
If the system can still see static device nodes for the devices it can, of 
course, still ue them even with devfs built into the kernel.
