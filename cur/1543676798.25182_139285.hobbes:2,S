I have several fixes and patches. Unfortunely they don't get much testing 
outside a few people. I think the best plan at this point is to apply the 
newest code to the -mm tree for testing and after several weeks try to 
push it to linus. The framebuffer stuff will always take time to sync 
mainline because if its wrong your system is borked. Its better to make 
sure its working ~100% before commiting.
