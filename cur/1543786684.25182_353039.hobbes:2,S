That would be ideal, thanks.  Grab the latest from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
 and take a look at
Documentation/git-bisect-script.txt
We ought to have the git bisection process documented in the kernel tree,
but we don't, alas.  There's stuff at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/24/234
but a standalone document which walks people through installing git,
pulling the initial tree, building and bisecting is needed (hint).
