 	New version uploaded on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/namespaces-d-S2.gz
Changes:
	* fixed an idiotic bug in get_filesystem_info() that din't 
unfortunately) show up on UP.
	* nosuid/nodev/noexec work in any combinations (had been b0rken in
previous version).
	* fixed multiple-mount (had been b0rken; --bind worked, but attempt
to mount the device you've already had mounted did bad things).
	* sanity checks for mount --move were missing. Fixed.
	* Assorted cleanups.
Folks, please help with testing.
 							Cheers,
								Al
