What about something like this? I believe node_present_pages should be
the same as nym_physpages on a non-NUMA machine. If not we can make it
min(num_physpages, NODE_DATA(0)->node_present_pages).
Of course this might not work perfectly if one has multiple nodes and
node 0 has no or very little memory. It would also be nice if one
could spread the various caches onto various nodes, but we can leave
that for stage 2 ;-)
Cheers,
Jes
