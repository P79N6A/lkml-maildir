Hi all,
Is the IDE driver in the kernel is generic ?
Whether it can support CF Interfaces to a processor which has bo IDE 
controller ?
For eg if a CF is connected to a local bus whether the ide driver in the 
kernel can access it ?
If any modifications are needed,what are they ?
I hope its only the IDE_BASE 
If not so please provide some more info
