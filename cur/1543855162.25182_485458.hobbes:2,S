I don't think you read the whole sentence I wrote.
Go back: USER just means "it it can fail much more eagerly". It really has 
nothing to do with user-mode per se. It's just not so core that the kernel 
cannot handle allocation failures, so it doesn't get to retry the 
allocation so eagerly.
THAT is why "movable" is almost guaranteed to also imply USER. Not because 
it's not a "kernel" allocation. After all, _all_ page allocations are 
kernel allocations, it's just that some are more likely to be associated 
with direct user requests, and some are more internal.
