Hi,
I've got this Asus A7N8X-X board and when using lm-sensors, these 
messages occasionally show up in my kernel logs:
w83l785ts 1-002e: Couldn't read value from register 0x53. Please report.
...and reporting is what I do with this email :)
Please see .config, dmidecode and more right here:

I suppose the message is informational anyway, since sensors(1) is 
working fine. Perhaps we can silence the printk to only show up when 
some debug-option is toggled?
Thanks,
Christian.
