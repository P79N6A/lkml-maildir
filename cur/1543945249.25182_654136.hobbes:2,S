Subject: [PATCH 1/2] sched: fair: virtual deadline scheduling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/114

Change CFS into a virtual deadline scheduler.
By flattening the grouping hierarchy into a single level we now end up with
tasks that have varying latency requirements. Tasks from group A might have a
larger latency period than those from group B as the period depends on the
number of runnable tasks within a group.
The current scheduling criteria does not take that into account - it assumes a
single latency period. In order to accommodate these varying latencies in the
scheduling decision, move to EDF [*] scheduling. We treat the tasks need + its
latency period as the deadline it has to meet. This includes the latency into
the scheduling decision.
[*] - EDF is correct up until load 1, after that it is not a closed system so
improvement is possible here. It is usable because the system strives to
generate the load 1 situation.
