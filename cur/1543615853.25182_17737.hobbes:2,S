?  Do you have an example where this fails?  Do you not consider it a
bug?  Now, I would place a fair amount of buren on the compiler to get
it right, though, this isn't absolute.  For example, eieieio or
whatever it is called on the powerpc.  I think the chip/OS/MMU must
bear some responsibility for meeting its obligations to the compiler,
and if it doesn't, then that chip/OS/MMU fails to provide a reasonable
base on which to provide the compiler.  Did you have this case in
mind?
