Subject: 2.4.17 Oops, maybe LVM ?

I'm getting reproducible oopses whenever I pull a file over the network
off of my LVM filesystem, so not exactly sure where this is coming
from...  this happens with vanilla 2.4.17 although the kernel that I 
captured the oops output from has LVM 1.0.2 and posix acls patches on
it.
Raw oops text and ksymoops output are at
