Using drm-intel-next from anholt on top, I've working GL (yeah!) but
get millions of
[  649.472172] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank
counter, -22
[  649.512429] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank
counter, -22
[  649.554513] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank
counter, -22
[  649.596972] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank
counter, -22
[  649.638744] [drm:drm_wait_vblank] *ERROR* failed to acquire vblank
counter, -22
entries in my log. libGL says
do_wait: drmWaitVBlank returned -1, IRQs don't seem to be working correctly.
Try adjusting the vblank_mode configuration parameter.
