Hmm this definitely worked here when I wrote the patches. Must have been a merge
mistake later. I remember someone changed the early CPU init around severly
at some point and I might have not correctly forward merged my changes
with this. In general it is pretty tough to keep up with git-x86 currently.
Sorry about that.
