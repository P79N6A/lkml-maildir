Hello all
The patch that provides agp support for Intel 820 chipsets is available 
for kernel 2.4.14(final). Please test and report/comment.
I also provide a bigger patch that also fixes the erroneous 16 bits 
writes/reads to the APSIZE register, which is 8 bits for 820, 840, 845, 
850 and 860 chipsets. Please test, and send me your comments/suggestions 
to improve this. It is working for me (Intel 820), but I need feedback 
from people having othjer chipsets.
You can find all the patches at

Nicolas.
