This statement I don't understand. Wouldn't it be pretty stupid
not to use the APIC of modern systems if available to get all
the benefits, like additional interrupts? At least my Asus A7V600
refuses to (net-)boot at all without a somewhat recent kernel *and*
APIC enabled in BIOS and kernel because the interrupt routing is
completely messed up. I'd rather let all users who have APIC
problems report on the list and wait until someone fixes the
issue instead of having them shut up and use less advanced
techniques instead unless you want to get those "but it works in
Windows" discussions going...
Servus,
