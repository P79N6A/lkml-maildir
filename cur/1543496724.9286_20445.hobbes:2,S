Hi,
if I'm not mistaken, the in_ntoa() in net/ipv4/utils.c is non-reentrant,
and used all over the place in ipv4 code. As the resulting strings
are printk()ed, and another CPU may just rewrite the string (without
a terminating '\0', for a brief moment), that may cause some problems.
(Kernel 2.2.9, with apologies if this is already fixed)
regards
  Patrick
