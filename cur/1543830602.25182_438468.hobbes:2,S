Through the filesystem namespace.  It is a weird case but it works :)

It is actually a noop.  Unless I goofed this is basically handled by
looking at which socket NFS is using to communicate, and plucking the 
namespace from there.
As I recall NFS gets the socket at mount time when it still has user
space context available.
So regardless if I implemented it correctly you can implement it that way
and always get the namespace context from whoever implemented it.
