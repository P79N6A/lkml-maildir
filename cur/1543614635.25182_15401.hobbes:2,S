If that's all we do, then we get 'warning: return discards qualifiers from
pointer target type'.  Adding an explicit cast gets rid of that:
static inline struct ext2_inode_info *ext2_i (const struct inode *inode)
{
	return (struct ext2_inode_info *) &(inode->u.ext2_inode_info);
}
However, then we're lying to the compiler.  I wonder how safe that is.

An upcoming version will use an explicit cast:
	return (struct ext2_inode_info *) (inode + 1);
In other words, it doesn't rely on the union, which we're trying to get rid of.
In this case, an inline function provides type saftey and a macro wouldn't.  I
also prefer to pass the inode/sb explicitly, rather than having a macro pick it
up from context.
In the superblock patch, the inline will be 'ext2_s'.  Al seems comfortable with
this terminology, so...
