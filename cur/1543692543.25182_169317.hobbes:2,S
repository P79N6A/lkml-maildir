Thanks for replying.
You aren't even using the wacom driver!
Mine works too in that way (I think it is some kind of regular PS/2 mouse 
emulation or so).
Come to think of it, maybe the problem lies in the XFree86 driver, which I 
suppose isn't really compatible with the new kernel. Well, whatayaknow... ;-)
