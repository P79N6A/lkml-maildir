Gotcha, thanks.
Quick question regarding reshaping, must one wait until the re-shape is 
completed before he or she grows the file system?
With the re-shape still in progress, I tried to grow the xfs FS but it 
stayed the same.
p34:~# df -h | grep /raid5

p34:~# mdadm /dev/md3 --grow --raid-disks=4
mdadm: Need to backup 384K of critical section..
mdadm: ... critical section passed.

I guess one has to wait until the reshape is complete before growing the 
filesystem..?
