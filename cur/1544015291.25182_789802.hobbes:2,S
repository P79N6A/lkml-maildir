    Byte PIO doesn't work in the ATA world unless the device supports it (I 
guess only CFA devices really support it) and the driver has enabled it (which 
I think isn't really worth it unless you have some h/w constaints). What you 
can do is read the whole 16-bit (or 32-bit) word and ignore the bytes you 
don't need.
