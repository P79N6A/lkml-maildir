Hi folks,
  I'm not a subscriber to this list so please respond via email if
possible <sims@sugar-land.sl.slb.com>.
  The problem:
  I have a Aaeon <
http://www.aaeon.com
> PCM-5894/5892 SBC with SiS 5582
(from the chip on the board) chipset... It has an Award BIOS... I am trying
to use it with a Toshiba MK6409MAV 2.5 inch disk drive... It 'sort of'
works but I get lots of errors (many <Busy>) and occasional corruption/
confusion/long delays while reading the drive.... I am running the latest
slackware and Kernel 2.2.6... I am in the process of upgrading the
kernel to 2.2.11 at the moment but decided to send off this note hoping
someone would be able to say 'move foo to bar and all will be well'....
I have been using Linux for a few years now and this is the first time
I have seen anything like this. The problem has been going on for a month
or so now and I am just about fed up so any help would be welcome :)
If I look in /proc/pci I see the following:
PCI devices found:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems 5597/5598 Host (rev 16).

      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe0000000].
The error I am seeing on the console at boot up with the Toshiba
drive is:
hda: drive_cmd: error 0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hda: drive_cmd: status 0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
If I install the Toshiba drive on another PC it seems to run fine....
At this point, any clues are more than welcome. I'm ready to do almost
ANYTHING...
TIA,
Dave
