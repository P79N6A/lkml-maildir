It is not really bogus. And it is not really real at the same time.
This is how it works AFAIU: pipes get created in pipefs (cat 
/proc/filesystems) (as do sockets in sockfs), and their dentry IS named 
"pipe:[46682]". You just can't see it because 1. you are prevented from 
mounting pipefs, 2. there are no readdir/etc. functions for pipefs 
implemented ATM.

Hm. Do you mean list "all pids of procs using an anynymous pipe" or
"list all pids [...]" using an anonymous pipe... :)
AFAICS, the first is not possible; the latter is (a fork-and-exec 
thing) is something different.
