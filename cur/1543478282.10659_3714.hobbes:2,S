Instead of worrying about storing the config information, what about
storing a (2-byte?) hash of .config and System.map and whatever else is
needed, in the kernel, so you can at least tell when you have the right
combination.  Then you can leave the archiving problem outside the kernel. 
The hash could be logged, etc. and the kernel debugging stuff could check
that you're dealing with a consistent set of files.
