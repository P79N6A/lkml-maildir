I didn't want to question the improvement in wall clock time terms.

Since I cannot reproduce oom kills with writeback, I sure can't
demonstrate it on bare hardware with unmodified kernel.
But I dislike code that works by luck, and sure I could demonstrate it
if I bothered to write an artificial testcase on simulated hardware.
This is the only reason I mentioned this bug in the first place, not
because I'm reproducing it.
