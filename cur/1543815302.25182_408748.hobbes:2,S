Shaoping, thanks for doing this work, it is something I have been
thinking about for the past few weeks.  It's especially nice to be
able to see how many pages are pinned in this manner.
Might I suggest calling it the long_term_pinned list?  It also might
be worth putting ramdisk pages on this list, since they cannot be
written out in response to memory pressure.  This would eliminate the
need for AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE.
