Subject: 2.6 - synaptics touchpad not handled by any driver

It appeared recently on a.o.l.m. Synaptics touchpad is not handled
by any driver except evdev. It is located in drivers/input/mouse and
is part of psmouse so one would logically assume it is handled by
mousedev - but it does not advertise any capability accepted by mousedev.
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=0007 Version=0000
N: Name="Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio1/input0
H: Handlers=
B: EV=1b
B: KEY=670000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B: ABS=1000003
B: MSC=4
the buttons advertised are
BTN_LEFT, BTN_RIGHT, BTN_MIDDLE, BTN_FORWARD, BTN_BACK.
mousedev accepts device with absolute coordinates only if it
advertises BTN_TOUCH:
        {
              .flags    = INPUT_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_EVBIT | INPUT_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_KE
YBIT | INPUT_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_ABSBIT,
              .evbit    = { BIT(EV_KEY) | BIT(EV_ABS) },
              .keybit   = { [LONG(BTN_TOUCH)] = BIT(BTN_TOUCH) },
              .absbit   = { BIT(ABS_X) | BIT(ABS_Y) },
         },/* A tablet like device, at least touch detection, two absolute axes
the same as tsdev.
something is fishy :) poor guy expected it to work like a mouse -
just like 2.4 did.
