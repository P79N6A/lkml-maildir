I really don't like this:

for two reasons:
 - horrible layout
 - bad type information
The first would be easy to fix (just put everything on a line of it's
own), but the second is harder: I don't like having two integers that can
easily be mixed up, and where order matters.
How about using a descriptor structure instead of the macro, and making
the filesystem declaration syntax look more like
	static struct file_system_type ext2_descriptor = {
		owner:		THIS_MODULE,
		fs_flags:	FS_REQUIRES_DEV,
		name:		"ext2",
		read_super:	ext2_read_super,
		sb_size:	sizeof(ext2_sb_info),
		inode_size:	sizeof(struct ext2_inode_info)
	};
which is more readable, and inherently documents _what_ those things are.
In short, I think the whole DECLARE_FSTYPE thing was a mistake, just to
avoid having people do the owner/flags thing. Doing the initialization
explicitly ends up being more readable, I think.
(If you _want_ to use a macro, you can do something like
	#define DECLARE_FS(var,type, a...) \
		struct file_system_type var = { \
			owner:          THIS_MODULE, \
			fs_flags:       FS_REQUIRES_DEV \
			name:		type,
			,##a };
and then you do
	DECLARE_FS(ext2_descriptor, "ext2",
		read_super:	ext2_read_super,
		sb_size:        sizeof(ext2_sb_info),
		inode_size:     sizeof(struct ext2_inode_info)
	);
which is kind of half-way between the two formats.
What do you think?
