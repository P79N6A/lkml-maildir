I did a fdisk on the device /dev/sda  and it found no bad blocks.  
I was given the suggestion from one person it sounds like a kernel bug since
redhat patches their kernels soo much.

Sounds like the partition map is a bit incorrect.
Try running badblocks on the drive itself (/dev/hda, not hda1). If the
problem disappears then it's with the partition map (i'd guess).
