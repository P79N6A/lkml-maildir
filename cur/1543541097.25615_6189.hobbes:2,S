Good eye. Once the X server has placed the video hardware back into vga
text mode again the consoel system has to reset the palette then. I have
several video cards and will test both patches together. It's still
strange the different results I have seen on different video cards for
switching from X server to the text console. For NVIDIA cards the console
gets dimmer (gamma ramp). For the ATI 128 video cards the console colors
are inverted. For voodoo cards the console is blanked and you have to type
reset blindly. These different results is what lead me to believe is was
hidden X server bugs.
