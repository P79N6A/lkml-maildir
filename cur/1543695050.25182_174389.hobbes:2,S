I don't see *any* rules for capabilities evolution explicitly
defined.  There are some limitations and some mandatory characteristics
that any rules of evolution must possess, and these seem to make
sense to me as far as they go.  But there's no explicit "pP' = blah";
perhaps there needs to be.

I agree for the most part, but why would you choose (=ei) rather
than just (=i)?  Also, what in your opinion should be the meaning
of (fE != 0 && fP=0) versus (fE != 0 && fP = fE)?

I do not think that rule is specified by the POSIX 1003.1e draft
either, although it is compliant.  Necessary distinction because
I believe we can change the rules in various ways and still be
compliant, if that is important.
Also, it is clear that the inconsistency you point out is due to
your assumption that a file with no capabilities is (=ei) by default.
If it were (=i), then this problem goes away, right?
