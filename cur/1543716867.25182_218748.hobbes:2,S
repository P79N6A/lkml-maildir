Subject: CRC32c warning on sparc64

This is 2.6.6-rc3+BK as of today on a sparc64 (gcc 3.3.3 on Debian):
  CC [M]  crypto/crc32c.o
crypto/crc32c.c:89: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
This is because chksum_update uses size_t (64-bit unsigned long on
sparc64) length argument but dia_update seems to want unsigned int as
the type of length.
What is the right fix - change the length in chksum_update() and
crc32c() to unsigned int?
