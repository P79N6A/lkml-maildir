Hey, that is interesting in itself, since playing the above kinds of games
makes it pretty clear to everybody that any infringement was done
wilfully. They should be talking to their lawyers about things like that.
Anyway, I suspect that rather than blacklist bad people, I'd much prefer
to have the module tags be done as counted strings instead. It should be
easy enough to do by just having the macro prepend a "sizeof(xxxx)"  
thing or something.
Hmm. At least with -sdt=c99 it should be trivial, with something like
	#define __MODULE_INFO(tag, name, info)		\
	static struct { int len; const char value[] }	\
	__module_cat(name,__LINE__) __attribute_used__	\
	__attribute__((section(".modinfo"),unused)) =	\
		{ sizeof(__stringify(tag) "=" info),	\
		__stringify(tag) "=" info }
doing the job.
That should make it pretty easy to parse the .modinfo section too.
