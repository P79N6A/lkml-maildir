I did, it's the LCSG (Linux Cabal Standards Group) :-)

Yes, absolutely, that's a bug.

No, it should work in the _best_ way, and if the standard got it wrong then
the standard has to change.

Incorrect.  The modern crop of filesystems has the concept of consistency
points, and data written after a consistency point is irrelevant except to the
next consistency point.  IOW, it's often ok to leave some buffers dirty on a
sync.  But for a dumb filesystem you just have to guess at what's needed for
a consistency point, and the best guess is 'whatever's dirty at the time of
sync'.
For metadata-only journalling the issues get more subtle and we need a ruling
from the ext3 guys.

We're working on that, see Jen's recent series of patches re barriers.

That's being worked on too, see Andre Hedrik's linuxdiskcert.org.

Sorry, I don't see the connection to sync.

Waiting until the data is on the platter doesn't violate SuS.

Where does it say that in SuS?  I not arguing in favor of waiting longer
than necessary, mind you.

Have you asked any users about that?
