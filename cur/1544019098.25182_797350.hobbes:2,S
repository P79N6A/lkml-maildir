btw., i have pulled it to not hold up the flow, but this is the absolutely 
last warning for Voyager to get fixed. There's perhaps two Voyager systems 
left in existence running mainline kernels (both owned by James) while the 
code you are hacking on code that affects tens of millions of Linux boxes.
Every minute you waste on thinking about Voyager build issues has a 
multiplier effect of 1:1000,000. Voyager needs to be isolated into 
arch/x86/kernel/voyager_quirks.c and that's it.
