Not really... we print out other information that is duplicated N times, 
because it is the common case that N-way systems have matched processors 
with matched capabilities.  The above caught my eye as well, but the 
alternative is to subvert the standard /proc/cpuinfo format and print 
something out only once, that clearly applies to each processor.
