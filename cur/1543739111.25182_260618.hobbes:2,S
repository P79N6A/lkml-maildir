this is what i believe you'll ultimately get under PREEMPT_REALTIME:
instant execution of the hardware interrupt thread! Just give it a
higher RT priority than any of the existing tasks in the system:
	chrt -f -p 99 `pidof "IRQ 9"`
it is only a couple of microseconds to switch over from the current task
to the IRQ handling thread.
the only difference to a 'direct' interrupt is that it is you who
determines the policy and the priority of interrupt handling.
with direct interrupts there's no choice - a hardware interrupt has the
highest priority. In fact there's not even any way to prioritize 
hardware interrupts relative to each other.

we could increase the RT priority range perhaps, and only allow IRQ
threads to venture into that range. But, this is really pushing a piece
of policy into the kernel. RT tasks interfering with interrupt threads
is an application level problem: priorities have to be properly set up
between RT applications anyway.

if you dont know the relative priority and dont want to allow (non-RT)
userspace starving of IRQ processing then you can make all of them
SCHED_FIFO priority 99.

what might make sense is to extend SELinux to allow partitioning of the
priority space. Allow 'normal' applications only SCHED_FIFO range 1-90,
and have 91-99 for IRQ threads, or something like that. I dont think
this priority scheme should be part of the kernel proper - it would be
an inflexible feature. But ... i have no strong feelings in either
direction.

unfortunately there's no 1:1 relationship between 'work' and
'completion' activies so no good mapping from tasks to interrupts. Think
about a SCHED_OTHER and a SCHED_FIFO task dirtying the same page and it
getting flushed out to disk by pdflush. Whose priority should the disk
interrupt inherit, if anything?

in reality it seems that most of the contention wrt. networks is on the
queueing level, not on the CPU use level. So the solution should rather
be on the 'jump the queue and get xmit-ed right now' level - i.e. the
use of priority-aware TCP/IP QoS features. They do not really need
priority inheritance for the hardware interrupt. (especially considering
that most network processing happens in softirq context, which is even
more anonymous than a hardirq handler.)
