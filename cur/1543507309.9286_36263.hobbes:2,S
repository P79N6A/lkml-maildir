Note we can't put crypto hooks into a kernel because America is stupid (not
America not Americans). They can go in the kerneli patches. Thats one
reason for just using ssh 8)

Packet aggregation works. The scarab driver does this. On a slow link the
aggregation is a win. On a faster link balancing the rx/tx overhead with
the aggregation latency is probably harder to tune but clearly a good idea.

Most packet bodies don't compress. Packet headers can be squashed with care
but the standard VJ compressor assumes packet ordering is roughly maintained
