Yes, I have.  I understand he's trying to expose objects and control methods
under /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/ tree and user can access it.  Actually,
I'm interested in hotplug part he mentioned and wondering if it's possible to
run _EJ0 method without any hotplug processing.  That's what I know so far,
since I didn't know he has already relased the new patch.  Thanks for the
information, I'll take a look at that :)
I'm sorry for the crossposting.  I just wanted to hear from every hotplug related
people as possible...  Now I'm sending this to you and lkml.
Thanks,
Kei
