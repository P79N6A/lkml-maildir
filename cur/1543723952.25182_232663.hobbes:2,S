That's limit of the ix86 architecture, not Linux.  64-bit systems
running Linux have no such limit.
That said, there are patches for 2.4 that create separate address
spaces for kernel and user (search for '4G/4G') at the cost of a
(sometimes significant) performance penalty.  4GB per-process is a
hard limit on 32-bit systems, so it's the most you'll get.
