It is important to maintain the "driver doesn't touch RTS/CTS"
semantics without regard to other (new) control flags.
An application might read the existing termios, and modify only
the bits it is aware of without verifying that new bits are zero.
CFLOWXXX also maintains a free setting for future flow modes, such as:
CFLOWZEN = alter RTS based on /dev/random
