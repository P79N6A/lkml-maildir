Just to add the result of one more test:
> Ok, I'm back with the results of the osdb test against 2.4.19 and 2.5.52
> Both the kernel booted with apm=off mem=40M
> osdb ran with 40M of data.
> To summarize the results:
> 2.4.19 "Single User Test"	806.78 seconds	(0:13:26.78)
> 2.5.52 "Single User Test"	3771.85 seconds	(1:02:51.85)
2.4.19(mem=24M) "Single User Test"	3371.98 seconds	(0:56:11.98)
Ciao,
Paolo
