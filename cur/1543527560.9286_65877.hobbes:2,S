Andre (and linux-kernel),
  I've got a problem with 2.3.48, at least with pre2 and 3.  
One of my hard disks is missing.  The drive is a western digital
WDC AC28400R.  
Here are the relevent lines from DMESG:
hdb:  WDC28400R, ATA Disk drive
hdb:  WDC AC28400R, 8063MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=1027/255/63 (U)DMA
The drive is LBA, like all my drives.  Its the ide0 slave, it
has 1 vfat, 2 ext2 partitions and 1 swap.  The problem in 2.3.48pre2/3
is that nothing on the drive mounts:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb2,
       or too many mounted file systems
       (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,
       instead of some logical partition inside?)
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb3,
       or too many mounted file systems
       (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,
       instead of some logical partition inside?)
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb1,
       or too many mounted file systems
       (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,
       instead of some logical partition inside?)
fdisk and cfdisk can see the partitions.  fsck gives something
like "short superblock"..   Sorry I dropped back to 2.2.15pre10 to
write this (which mounts everything on hdb just fine).
Thanks,
   Todd.
(PS. The lastest ide patch for 2.2.15 works great Andre, thanks.)
