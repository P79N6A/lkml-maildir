There's a better fix.  Since we are going to use seq_...() anyway,
we both have a buffer and length.  Moreover, if there's not enough
space to store the result, generic seq_file code will take care
about expanding buffer and calling us again.
IOW, we need to add seq_path(seq_file *, vfsmount *, dentry *) that would
DTRT.  That would have a benefit of avoiding extra allocation/freeing.
I'll send such patch in ~20 minutes.  BTW, it's also needed for /proc/swaps
and can be used for /proc/<pid>/maps if we switch it to seq_file (worth
doing anyway).
PS: math.psu.edu account is alive, but I'm not checking it often these
days, so Cc there is not too useful.
