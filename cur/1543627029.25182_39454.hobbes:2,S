That still doesn't solve the race with the interrupt handlers, you'd
need a buffer for each irq handler and one the softirq too to make
printk buffered and coeherent coherent across newlines (doable but even
more tricky and in turn less robust and less self contained).

Pavel omits the newline intentionally during debugging, to avoid losing
80% of the persistent stoarge in the framebuffer, but ok we could
implement a printk_flush that flushes the buffer afterwards no matte
what. Some other code may omit it by mistake, leading to the other cpus
blackholed and data lost after the buffer on the other cpus overflowed
so at least we should put a timer that spawns an huge warning if a cpu
doesn't flush the buffer in a rasonable amount of time so we can catch
those places.
Given the overcomplexity and the fact the logs should be parsed by
humans and the low probability for the race, I'm not sure if the above
is worthwhile.
If what you need is a high bandwith logging system, where with an high
frequency of posted events the races could become more likely to
trigger, printk is not the way to go for high bandwith anyways.
