NT Services for Macintosh actually implements 
all resource-fork data in one stream, and provides 
structured storage (prob. just a hash table, but I 
don't really know) to do it in. It doesn't map 
each EA to a separate stream. But, we'll play 
your game for a moment. The correct answer is 
B, "acox". It doesn't make sense to do anything
but wipe out what is there and replace it when 
doing EAs on top of named streams, with a 1:1 EA:NS 
mapping. Leaving what is there and overwriting part of
it isn't how EAs work, and isn't how EAs on NSes have
to work.
