That wouldn't be a "port", it would have to be a complete
reimplementation from scratch.  And, of course, of further concern
would be whether or not there are any patents that Sun may have filed
covering ZFS.  If the patents have only been licensed for CDDL
licensed code, then that won't help a GPL'ed covered reimplementation.
