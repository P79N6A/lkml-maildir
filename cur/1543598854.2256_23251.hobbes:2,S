You've said this before. :)  Just how small of an 'embedded' system are
you talking about?  I know of people who do compile a kernel now and
again on a 'small' system, for fun.  On a larger (cPCI) system, I
don't see your point.  If you can somehow transport the 21mb[1] bzip2
kernel source to your system, you can transport python.  If you're
porting to a brand new arch, there's still good tests before you
have shlib support (You've mentioned that before too I think).

Which is what?  The dependancy on python2?

As long as it does everything the current version does and is just as
fast I don't think there'll be much of an argument for either.  Hell,
probably both for a while...
