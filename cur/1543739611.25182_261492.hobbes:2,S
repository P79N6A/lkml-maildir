Glad that worked.  So the problem area is still in reading the first
sector.  Jeff's was too, but his BIOS was reporting having disks
present which weren't really there, so the sector read would
eventually time out.
On 
http://linux.dell.com/dkms/results.html
 is this simple script
below.  This will report whatever is in the /sys/firmware/edd tree.
Also include with this a brief hardware description of your system
(how many disks are actually present, and attached to which
controllers, as you can determine by looking at the cables).
#!/bin/sh
tree /sys
find /sys/firmware/edd -type f -not -name raw_data -print -exec cat
\{\} \;
find /sys/firmware/edd -type f -name raw_data -print -exec hexdump -C
\{\} \;
lspci -vv
lsmod
[ -e /proc/scsi/scsi ] && cat /proc/scsi/scsi
dmidecode
If there's a way to know at runtime if a system has a BIOS that
misrepresents the number of disks present, I'd like to put in such a
quirk.  However, this is really really early in system startup, and
I'd prefer not to have to read the DMI tables to do it...  Thoughts?
Thanks,
Matt
