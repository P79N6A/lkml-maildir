Subject: Kernel 2.6.1: Sidewinder Precision 2 not working

Hello,
I once used the Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick in kernel 2.4.22 but the 
calibration wasn't any good. I just thought to give it a try in the 
2.6.1 kernel, I loaded the module, modprobe sidewinder without any 
errors. Yet, when I run FlighGear with fgfs --control=joystick or with 
just fgfs I can't use it. I don't know if this is a kernel bug, but I 
though it might be worth posting it.
