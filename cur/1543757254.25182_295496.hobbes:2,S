What do you mean? I thought it already compares signatures of the booting
kernel and suspend image. Just wipe it out if it does not match, or, even
better, just stop if signature does not match unless one boots with
"nosuspend". This way even if I start booting wrong image I have a chance
to select right one and avoid fsck.
