If your system, and your disks, are so fast that they can not only finish the 
build in under a second but can also flush the cache and reload it from disk 
in under a second, then:
A) the spurious rebuild is still a tiny fraction of a second.
B) You're seeing a penalty for using a filesystem that's too old for your 
setup.  This is a configuration problem in userspace.
C) How would having ALL times rounded to a second be an improvement?
