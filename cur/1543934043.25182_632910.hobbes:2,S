This shouldn't be necessary, the bus clk already references the master
clk as its parent, and inherits the rate from there. If you have no
recalc work to do, then you should be able to just leave this out
altogether. If you actually need this dummy init, then something is
broken with the upper layer, which we should fix ;-)
Patch looks fine otherwise. Tidy this up and I'll apply it.
