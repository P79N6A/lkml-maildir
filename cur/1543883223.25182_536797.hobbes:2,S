Hi,
i got a problem with the combination of an Asrock AM2NF4G-SATA2
mainboard with a Radeon X1900 (chip 1002,724b) graphics
card. /i386/pci/mmconfig.c reports a buggy bios (e0000000 is not
E820-reserved). System crashes only happen when viewing films (neither
xine nor mplayer run with root privileges) and independent of video
drivers (framebuffer, vesa and fglrx). Logs dont show any anomalies
before crashing. Anybody got a clue?
Thanks,
Syren
