Before the reply, I dont examin getreg() carefully. But now, I still
believe the bug is exist. see the blow (ptrace.c case PTRACE_GETREGS):
    for ( i = 0; i < FRAME_SIZE*sizeof(long); i += sizeof(long) ) {
            __put_user(getreg(child, i),(unsigned long *) data);
            data += sizeof(long);
    }
when i = FS*sizeof(long), the getreg() return child->thread.fs,
and the value will be copy into *data of user-space, but
*data is point to orig_eax of struct pt_regs.
So, when i = ORIG_EAX*sizeof(long), even getreg() adjust his regno,
that let us get accurate registers, but it copy value into wrong member of
struct pt_regs ( the *data is point to xcs member, not orig_eax member,
because the line: data += sizeof(long); never be adjust)
If we dont modify struct pt_regs, maybe we should fix the ptrace.c?
