+	MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES:  This flag specifies that the nodemask passed
+	by the user should remain in the same context as it is for the
+	current task or VMA's set of accessible nodes after the memory
+	policy has been defined.
+
+	    Without this flag (and without MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES), anytime a
+	    mempolicy is rebound because of a change in the set of
+	    accessible nodes, the node (Preferred) or nodemask (Bind,
+	    Interleave) is remapped to the new set of accessible nodes.
+	    With this flag, the remap is done to ensure the context of the
+	    previous nodemask with its set of allowed mems is preserved.
Hmmm ... I've read this several times now ... still can't figure out
what it's saying ;).  And it doesn't really explain key aspects of
MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES, such as that it provides cpuset relative
numbering (use nodes 0..N-1, regardless of your current cpuset, to
refer to the first N nodes in whatever is your current cpuset.)
Perhaps we'd be further ahead of the game if you started with the
documentation changes to Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt,
in my patch:

Change MPOL_MASK_REL to MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES and similar changes.
