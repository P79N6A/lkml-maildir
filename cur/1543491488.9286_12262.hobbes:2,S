I am not on the kernel list, please reply in personal email (or at least CC

Does anyone know of or is anyone working on 3Com 3CSOHO100-TX support?  This
chip is in their Office Connect series of cards.
As far as I know this card is only supported currently in 95 and NT, so I'm
wondering if this is some sort of 'win-net' card - I'm of course hoping
otherwise.
