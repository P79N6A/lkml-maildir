I agree.

I'll incorporate this change if we get enough consensus to justify a 
re-re-re-submit.  Since the patch is intended to be a functional no-op on m32r, 
I'm inclined to leave it alone at the moment.

You're not the only arch maintainer who prefers doing it in C.  If you trust 
your compiler (a big "if", apparently), inline asm only improves code generation 
if you have a whole bunch of general purpose registers for the optimizer to play 
with.
