OK, this sounds right.  To recap, we were concerned that when the page
scanner went around clearing dirty (accessed) bits, that
fix_range_common wasn't write (read) protecting the page in order to
emulate the cleared bits.
However, set_pte does set _PAGE_NEWPAGE, which forces the page through
a full update, including dirty/accessed bit emulation.
Correct?
However, I did add some parenthesis to your patch:
	WARN_ON(!pte_young(*pte) || (pte_write(*pte) && !pte_dirty(*pte)));
This seems clearer to me.
So, your pte consolidation patch is still in my tree, the other two
pte patches are dropped.

Excellent.

Good.
