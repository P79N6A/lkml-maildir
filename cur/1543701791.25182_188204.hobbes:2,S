I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is odd. I'll try
emailing the maintainers of the filesystems directly and see what response

I just want to find out what is actually going on and why that code was
put there in the first place before I start changing/removing anything.
Currently I'm digging on my own but haven't come up with much yet - except

I note in a reply to my initial mail)...
I'll keep digging.
