It's just a different way of looking at it.   NFS exports filesystems,  
not namespaces.  It's the server implementation that decides it should 
try to map these exports to its local namespace.  Indeed, this is what 
exportfs and /etc/exports tries to do.  Nobody said this mapping made 
alot of sense.

Your on your own on that one.  I don't see it as an issue as the 
semantics are pretty well defined.

Ok.  Thanks for clearing that up.
