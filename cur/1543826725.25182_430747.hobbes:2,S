You are right.  My testing originally showed something different, but
testing again shows the correct semantics.
I think that the conservative thing to do though, since an over the wire
call is being made anyway, is to remove the optimization and retain the
size change.  The server is already going to have such a check in it
anyway and issuing the SETATTR with the size change in it may reduce
some races.

I saw that wording too and assumed what I think that you assumed.  I assumed
that that meant that if the new size is equal to the old size, then nothing
should be changed.  However, that does not seem to be how those words are to
be interpreted.  They are to be interpreted as "if the new length of the 
file
can be successfully set, then the mtime/ctime should be changed".  It does
not matter if the new length was the same as the old length or not.  Linux
implements this semantic, as you pointed out above regarding the client side
changes with the passing of ATTR_MTIME|ATTR_CTIME to do_truncate().  SunOS
also implements this semantic.
Therefore, I believe that this patch should stand because it modifies 
the NFS
server to do the right thing and indeed, to match the current semantics of
do_truncate().  The older version of do_truncate() would have set ATTR_MTIME
and ATTR_CTIME itself if the file size was not actually changing.  Clients
such as SunOS and older versions of Linux will require this change in order
to properly interoperate with a new enough Linux NFS server.
Neil, can we get these changes integrated, please?
    Thanx...
