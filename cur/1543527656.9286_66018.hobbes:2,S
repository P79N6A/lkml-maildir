Even easier is to delete an empty directory that's the CWD of a
process. The delete works fine, with the result that the process
in question can't do `cd ..` or any relative cd but has to do an
absolute cd or a `cd ~` to get anywhere.
I've done that several times, usually by accident.
Best wishes from Riley.
