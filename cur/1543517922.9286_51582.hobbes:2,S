Every single problem that has been mentioned about Binary Portable 
modules for the Linux kernel is solvable. For the case of SMP and UP 
kernel modules, allow the developer the *option* of compiling the 
binary module with or withour SMP support. If compiled with SMP 
support, the module should still work on a UP kernel as the kernel 
would provide dummy locking functions or the UP equivalents to the 
driver. If compiled without SMP, the module would fail to load on SMP 
kernels (with an error message to the system log).
In many cases binary modules could easily be built as SMP compatible 
without any real performance hit on the system. If there is a 
performance hit, the developer can build both SMP and UP versions of 
the modules.
