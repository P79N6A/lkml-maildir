The trick is that the FS hosting the swapfile is *not* mounted at all;
you don't even activate the swap. resume process uses the block number
(better: the couple <devid, block>) to locate the swapfile.
The "ugly" part of this method is that the user has to figure out the
first block of the swapfile, since at resume time it's not possibile to
mount the fs (not even read only - journaled filesystems will blow up
due to journal replay) to search the swap area...
