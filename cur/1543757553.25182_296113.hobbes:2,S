Depends on the implementation and what's required for network connectivity 
to the remote server. When I said that I was talking about the method that 
Lee Revell talked about, where he said "We should start X and initialize the 
display and get the login prompt up there ASAP, and let the system acquire 
the DHCP lease and start sendmail and apache and get the date from the NTP 
server *in the background while I am logging in*.  It's not rocket science". 
Obviously, if the network is started synchronously it won't matter.
