[root@spc1 steven]# cat /proc/sys/sched/max_timeslice
200
[root@spc1 steven]# echo 50 >/proc/sys/sched/max_timeslice
[root@spc1 steven]# cat /proc/sys/sched/max_timeslice

Ouch. I inserted the above text saved as a file, and had to wait
over a minute after hitting the OK button.  I aborted dbench which was
running 24 clients on ext3 just to finish this.
The change in max_timeslice didn't seem to improve things.
Apart from the little matter of crashing, 2.5-bk was more usable at that
and higher loads.
I'll try the different value of max_timeslice with dbench on reiserfs
next.  That's where the lack of response was most evident.
