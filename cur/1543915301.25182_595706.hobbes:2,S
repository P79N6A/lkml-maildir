Okay, then in the BIOS, make sure that IRQ12 is not assigned to
a specific device. In other words, set it to PnP (if available).
As you well know, PCI requires sharable interrupts and edges
are not sharable so something is broken. As a last resort,
move your PCI board to abother slot which should pick up another
interrupt, which may not be broken. If that doesn't work, see
if a new BIOS is available for download.
