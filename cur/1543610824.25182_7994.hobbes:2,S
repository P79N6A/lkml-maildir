   Can you submit that version? ;)
No, because it is writable by the user in every kernel source tree I
have ever seen, the change makes no sense.
In the official tarballs it is writable, and even in every CVS tree
(2.2.x, 2.4.x vger) I have looked at it is writable.
And as Alan has stated, this code is pretty irrelevant soon.
