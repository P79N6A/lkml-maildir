I have searched without success for this driver.
Qlogic tech support doesn't seem to know about it. 
Can you lead me to a link or provide this driver?
Thanks,

Please clarify "lack FC HBA drivers".
You mean no in kernel drivers? Yeh.
The qlogic (qla2xxx) driver is not in the kernel, but is available for use

Martin Bligh included an emulex driver in his last 2.6 patch set.
