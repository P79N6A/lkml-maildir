	Hello Ted,
	I have a rockwell-based internal PCI modem (PCI vendor ID 0x127a,
device id 0x1025) and I wonder whether it is possible to use it under Linux.
From the documentation it seems it is not a Winmodem. The output of the
lspci -vv follows:
00:09.0 Communication controller: Rockwell International: Unknown device 1025 (rev 01)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 127a:1025
	Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
	Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Latency: 64 set
	Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 0
	Region 0: Memory at e7000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Region 1: I/O ports at e800
	Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
		Flags: PMEClk- AuxPwr+ DSI+ D1- D2- PME+
		Status: D0 PME-Enable+ DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
	I have tried to add the device description (vendor and device ids)
to the pci_boards[] array in linux/drivers/net/serial.c, but I am not sure
what device flags I should use here. I have tried the following entries:
        {       PCI_VENDOR_ID_ROCKWELL, 0x1025,
                PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 
                SPCI_FL_BASE1, 1, 115200 },
        {       PCI_VENDOR_ID_ROCKWELL, 0x1025,
                PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 
                SPCI_FL_BASE1 | SPCI_FL_IOMEM, 1, 115200 },
	I have got the "register_serial(): autoconfig failed" message
after adding any of the above entries into the pci_boards[] array.
	Is it possible to use this device under Linux? Do you need
some more information on this device from me?
	Thanks in advance,
-Yenya
