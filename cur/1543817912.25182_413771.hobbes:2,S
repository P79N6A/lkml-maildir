Could these "add xxx to arch/powerpc" patches please move any relevant
headers files to include/asm-powerpc as well.  It would be nice if we
could remove the hack from the powerpc Makefile that include files from
include/asm-ppc.  i.e. My opinion is that if any ARCH=powerpc build
requires a file in include/asm-ppc, then that file should be moved to
include/asm-powerpc.  I am doing a set of patches to that effect.
