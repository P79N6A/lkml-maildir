Hello Linux users
My kernel just gave me a Panic on my SMP box, /usr mounted over NFS.
I got this message on my console:
---SNIP

Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill idle task!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
---SNIP
My system is a dual Celeron-300@450, one IDE disk (VA34323A), two Ethernet
cards (via-rhine and 3c509B), SoundBlaster AWE64, one SCSI controller
(53c875) with a Plextor CD-ROM, and a MATUSHITA CD-Writer, my graphics card
is a Creative Voodoo Banshee.
I mount /usr and /home from another box thru a 100Mbit full-duplex line over
the via-rhine card (had some bad problems with the 3c905B and a RTL8139),
use NYS/NIS over the same line for passwd/gruop. Generaly the NFS link has
been badly broken! (Using the userland NFS deamon) And I suspect I have some
bad Ethernet cards on the server.
The Oops happend when I telnetede in from a third box thru the 3c905B card,
and did a 'man something' but I can't recreate it. The box had been up
around 20 hours when the panic happend (I have just installed Slackware 7.0
to get glibc2.1.2), but have had uptimes in the past around 10 days with a
load of 2 (running rc5des).
The drivers for the Ethernet cards are the latest beta drivers, since I had
some troubles with the kernel drivers.
If you need any more info I'll be HAPPY to supply it.
Mvh.
