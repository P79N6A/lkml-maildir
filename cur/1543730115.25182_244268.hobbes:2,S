   Not sure where to send this: the MAINTAINERS file is getting a
little old, and the email addresses it suggests as most likely to be
the correct ones to send it to no longer exist. Even the home page it
gives for the input drivers (
http://www.suse.cz/development/input/
)
doesn't seem to exist any more.
   I've found a typo in drivers/input/gameport/Makefile in kernel
2.6.8.1 which effectively prevents the CS461x gameport code from
being included. Here's the diff:
*** Makefile.orig	Sat Aug 14 06:54:47 2004
--- Makefile	Sun Aug 22 02:31:55 2004
***************
*** 5,11 ****
  # Each configuration option enables a list of files.
  
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT)		+= gameport.o
! obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS461X)	+= cs461x.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1)	+= emu10k1-gp.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_FM801)	+= fm801-gp.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_L4)	+= lightning.o
--- 5,11 ----
  # Each configuration option enables a list of files.
  
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT)		+= gameport.o
! obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS461x)	+= cs461x.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1)	+= emu10k1-gp.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_FM801)	+= fm801-gp.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_L4)	+= lightning.o
   This typo seems to have been present since at least 2.6.4, and
probably since the beginning of the 2.6 series at least. The fact that
nobody seems to have noticed until now makes me wonder if anyone's
actually using it, but what the heck....
