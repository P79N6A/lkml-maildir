A few architectures still don't have a correct O_CLOEXEC definition.
The default definition in <asm-generic/fcntl.h> is wrong for some archs
and you really don't want see 2.6.23 released with a broken ABI.
Affected as far as I know:
Alpha:   probably needs value 010000000
Sparc*:         -"-           0x400000
