While attempting to compile support for smbfs into kernel version
2.3.11 (2.3.9 tarball, patched to 2.3.10, patched to 2.3.11) I get
this error.

I decided to compile it in after recieving:
[demaagd@chernabog /usr/src/linux]$ sudo insmod smbfs
/lib/modules/2.3.11/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol get_cached_page
with it as a module.  The rest of the kernel runs great (at least as
far as I can tell).  Did I mess something up (the .config is attached)??
