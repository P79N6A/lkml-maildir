I looked at this last time you reported it.  Which compiler are you
using?
Line 440 of ide-cd.h is:
	__u8 short slot_tablelen;
'short' doesn't make any sense there.  __u8 is unsigned char.
I can't figure out why you're the only one getting an error.  That
change went in a few kernels ago and I've compiled ide-cd in every one
of them and it compiles fine for me.
