I used all the default-settings on 2.6.11

This doesnt explain the speed-up when I change lower_zone_protection from 0 to 1024. It also doesnt 
explain the slowdown on 2.6.11 compared to 2.6.10

Yes I just wait until they connect. On the graph it only takes about 2 minutes until 3000 sockets 
are created again.

I am not doing more than calling sendfile. There  is nothing one can do wrong.

The problem still is that 1) it speeds up immediately when lower_zone_protection is raised to 1024. 
This proves it is NOT a disk-bottleneck. And second: it got much worse with 2.6.11 and 
lower_zone_protection disappeared on 2.6.11
