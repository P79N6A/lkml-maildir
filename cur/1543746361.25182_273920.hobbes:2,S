Yeah... well, unfortunately, it's almost impossible to get your hands on a usb 
enclosure, break the seals on the wrapping, test it, then go back nagging it 
doesn't work at the vendor - while it does work in <insert certain os name 
here>. While I do agree - and try to find linux-compatible devices whenever 
possible - this isn't really helpful to the end-user imo...
I've got it working now, and it works great after the udelay(200); 
modification.
