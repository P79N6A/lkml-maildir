Actually, the kernel could just "jump in". That is, when you start
in fb mode, you get the regular 8x16 vga font - on your choice of
resolution, and can also set it with setfont. So far so nice.
Now, when you start fbiterm -- for example to read CJK --, fbiterm
presents you with what looks like a 12x24 font. Also good.
It _looks_ to me like fbiterm does the drawing itself; ok too.
Now when the kernel is oopsing, it could just spew out the oops
trace in the regular font (vga8x16 or in case you use CONFIG_FONTS,
then that), possibly obstructing some output generated by fbiterm,
but in case of oops, I think this is ok.
