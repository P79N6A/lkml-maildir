Will do so. However, previous statements from NVIDIA fairly clearly 
indicate that this is the case.

Well, there is an indirect link. The ADMA interface (which supports 
64-bit DMA) cannot be used to issue ATAPI commands, so if an ATAPI 
device is connected we have to go to legacy mode, which supports only 
32-bit DMA.
I'm not sure why ADMA mode doesn't support ATAPI. The only reason I can 
think of is that there's issues since ATAPI commands can potentially be 
of unpredictable transfer size. The "real" ADMA spec that the NVIDIA 
implementation is loosely based on does have some special "ignore 
excess" controls that don't seem to be in the NVIDIA version (or at 
least not to the knowledge I have on this hardware).
And yes, it is a rather unfortunate hardware shortcoming (presuming that 
it is entirely true).
