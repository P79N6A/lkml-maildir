I have been having the "memory.c bad pmds" with a Tyan S2885 
motherboard.

When Yhlu brought up the topic of LinuxBIOS, I thought he might be 
suggesting that this would prove there are no problems with the BIOS 
(i.e. the same problems would occur with LinuxBIOS as with the 
motherboards built-in BIOS). Looking at the LinuxBIOS web site, I got 
the impression (I may be wrong) that this was a Tyan supported effort. 
If that was the case I was wondering why Tyan didn't mention LinuxBIOS 
on their web site. It would make me more comfortable if this were a Tyan 
supported effort. That's why I asked the question.
I'm just trying anything I can to get rid of the bad pmd messages.
