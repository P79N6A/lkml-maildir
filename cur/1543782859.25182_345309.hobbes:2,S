Hi all,
I built and installed 2.6.13 today, and oldconfig revealed the new option for 
timer frequency.
I searched the LKML on this, but all I found is the technical stuff - not 
really any layman solutions.
Two n00b questions here:
What does this do/what is it for?
I selected default, 250Hz.  If this is now an option, what was it before?
Thanks,
Nick
