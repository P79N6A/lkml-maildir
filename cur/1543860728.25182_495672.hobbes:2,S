Hi Adam,
I'm sorry I just saw this mail (mail not sent directly to me get shuffled off 
to a folder).  I agree with your patch, I think dropping and then re-taking 
the RCU lock is the best way to go, although I'm curious to see what others 
have to say.
The only real comment I have with the patch is that there is some extra 
whitespace which could probably be removed, but that is more of a style nit 
than anything substantial.

From your description above I'm not sure I like that approach so much, 
however, I could be misunderstanding something.  Do you have a small example 
you could send?
