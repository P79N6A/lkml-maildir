Linux is already distro-specific.  Different distributions already use
different, customised kernels.  You didn't know that?
Some of them may even ship with Reiserfs.
Anyway, the arguments against including Reiserfs at this time are not
about market positioning or user information.  They are about technical
development and maintenance issues.  An fs in the kernel tree is not
independent of the generic VFS code.  Once in the tree, the two are
evolved together.  This holds even for "experimental" code.
Good fs code of general interest generally does get into the kernel
tree, if it's clean and works as the current VFS expects.

Nonsense.  With your political dictatorship example you have defined
choice to mean "if they want to, they can".  And chance to mean "they
can try but they won't necessarily get it".
Actually a democracy doesn't give people (plural not "the people") the
choice to change their political system -- tyranny of the majority may
prevent that or, often, even if the majority wish to change something
that may not be possible within the chosen democratic system.  (I know
of no perfect system).
