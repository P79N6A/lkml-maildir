Not sure which code you are referring to here ?? I dont see any nodemask
referring to SMT siblings ?

fine

I tried your script and see that it makes absolutely no impact on top.
The CPU on which it is running is mostly 100% idle. However I'll run
more tests to confirm that it has no impact

ok for both

I dont know how that snuck back in, I'll change that

ok 
I do feel with the above updates the patches can go into -mm.
Appreciate all the review comments from everyone, Thanks
