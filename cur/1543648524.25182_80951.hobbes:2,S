Subject: [PATCHSET] Mobile IPv6 for 2.5.43
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Alexey, Dave, everyone,
We are resending our code for kernel inclusion consideration.  I hope
with this submission we have addressed all the concerns raised on the
list (i.e. draft revision) as well as offline (splitting the patch to
smaller chunks).
To Pekka and Hideaki,
Intermediate revision of the specification "Draft 18++" appeared a few
days ago, which addressed most of the issues with earlier drafts (16,
17, 18).  This made it possible to update our code to something usable
(later than 15).  This patch set has support for most of it.
To Alexey, (and everyone else)
The patch has been split for easier reading as follows:
ipv6_tunnel.patch	6over6 tunneling
network_mods.patch	Modifications to network code and hooks
mipv6_cn_support.patch	Correspondent node support (+common code)
mipv6_mn_support.patch	Mobile node support (+common code with HA)
mipv6_ha_support.patch	Home agent support
The patches are incremental, so they must be applied in this order.
