there's no "backtrace sysctl" planned for the moment. This "hung tasks" 
debugging feature can be disabled/enabled on a wide scale already:
 - in the .config
 - runtime, temporarily, via:
     echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs
 - runtime, permanently, via adding:
     kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs = 0
   to /etc/sysctl.conf.
the backtrace, as other posters have stated it in this thread too, is 
very useful, so i'll not remove it from the printout.
