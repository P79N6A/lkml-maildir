To use SSE in kernel space, we need to wrap it in kernel_fpu_begin() /
kernel_fpu_end() pairs anyway. gcc doesn't (and can't) know this.

it's non-obvious that it'll break things when people use broken compilers.
read what I wrote before, several gcc versions got this horribly wrong.
"athlon4" was even tuned for 64bit at one point.
Take away the SSE, take away the broken compiler versions, and you'd be
left with something that would hardly show a blip on a benchmark.
