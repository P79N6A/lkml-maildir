Yep, I thought about something like that... and I assume you'd need a
bit of locking around them too.

Yes, but if you happen to warn deeper anyway, just because you got
"lucky" with IRQ timing, you'll still explode.  Regardless of where the
threshold is, there's still a risk of starting the warning deeper than
that.  Whatever stack the warning takes effectively reduces the useable
stack size.
