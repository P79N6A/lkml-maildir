Hi,
I resubmit the patch supporting the latest Chelsio T3 adapter.
It incoporpates feedbacks from Stephen and Jan.
This patch adds support for the latest Chelsio adapter, T3. It is built
against 2.6.19.
A corresponding monolithic patch against 2.6.19 is posted at the
following URL: 
http://service.chelsio.com/kernel.org/cxgb3.patch.bz2
We wish this patch to be considered for inclusion in 2.6.20. This driver
is required by the Chelsio T3 RDMA driver which was updated on 12/02/2006.
Cheers,
Divy
