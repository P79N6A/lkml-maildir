They're the two non-leaf functions - they expand other inlines and end up
quite big.

Hard call.  Lots of hand-waving is involved.
Yes, an aggregate reduction in kernel text size is a good thing, but the
main reason for uninlining things is for performance: reduction of icache
footprint.
If an inline function is expanded several times in, say, fs/dcache.c then
it's a good candidate for uninlining, because it's probably the case that
all the expanded versions are in icache simultaneously.  But if a function
is expanded once in ext2 and once in ext3 then it's less useful to uninline
it, because it is rare that two different filesystem drivers are in use
simultaneously.
