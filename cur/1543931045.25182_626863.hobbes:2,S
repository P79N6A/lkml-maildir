Mutter.  These would be better as static inlines.  A macro just invites
variable-unused warnings on non-ia64 and outright compilation errors on
ia64.  Speaking from experience...
static inline void arch_ptrace_stop(int exit_code, siginfo_t *info)
{
}
#define arch_ptrace_stop arch_ptrace_stop
should work?

Could you please take a peek at the infrastructure added by
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc4/2.6.24-rc4-mm1/broken-out/add-lock_page_killable.patch
and see if there is exploitable commonality?
