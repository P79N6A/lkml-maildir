I applied the patches, and reported some issues.

I see no signs that any of them have been addressed, although I haven't tried 
a really recent set.

Actually, this is the area that Linux is best at. If you break it, some poor 
sod will hit the problem, and you'll know really soon.

I'm a fairly typical user - I just have a couple of desktop machines and a 
server/firewall. 
I don't have 700 nodes in a cluster, and when my machines break, its normally 
something I did. Sometimes the desktop locks up (say every second month, 
unless I'm dicking with the kernel), but I reboot and everything is happy.
LKCD doesn't really seem to do anything for me - it wouldn't really worry me 
if it went in (since I don't have to maintain it - it isn't near any of my 
code), but I'd really prefer that having the _CONFIG option set to N didn't 
make the kernel any bigger, or change any code paths.
Is this unreasonable?
Brad
BTW: I admit that I'd be pretty pissed if Linus said that my code was 
"stupid", but life isn't reasonable or fair. Take a few days off LKCD, go for 
a few walks, and worry about how to get it integrated after that.
