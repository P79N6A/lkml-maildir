Some years ago, the PCI routines have really used this strategy
(and the obsolete help text reflects this situation), but unfortunately,
there exist machines where the direct access detection gives bogus
results, so it's much better to ask the BIOS first. Also, it's conceptually
cleaner to use a well-defined BIOS interface than to probe random
ports (well, they are random on all non-PCI machines).
These are the reasons why I'd prefer keeping the current code and
just fixing the documentation.
Also, you can easily make your machine boot by specifying "pci=conf1"
at the kernel command line. I admit it isn't a nice solution, but I
don't know any way which would be 100% reliable on all machines
and your machine is the only case I know about where the current
algorithm breaks.
				Have a nice fortnight
