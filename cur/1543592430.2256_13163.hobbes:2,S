Patches to drivers/scsi/sg.c included in 2.4.4-ac17 require for
'sg.o' module to use 'simple_strtol' which is not exported in
kernel/ksyms.c.  Is this is an oversight or 'sg.o' should be actually
using something like 'simple_strtoul' - which is already exported?
In either case patches are obvious.
BTW - is tulip supposed to already work in this version?  Because
it does not.
