`make modules_install' will never ever end up installing the kernel
image or the System.map or any other architecture-specific boot
images. It'll install the modules, nothing more.
The packaging scripts OTOH will of course also take that stuff.

Installing the kernel image is quite architecture specific; most
architectures use $(INSTALL_PATH), so this could be something like
/path/to/target_system/boot .  Though they may also re-run lilo or
something like that, so it's possibly not what you actually want to
use.
