	Folks, promised cleanup of ialloc.c is on
ftp.math.psu.edu:pub/viro/ialloc.c,v
And yes, it's in RCS.  The thing is split into _really_ small
steps (commented in the log).  Each is a trivial transformation
and it should be very easy to verify correctness of any of
them.
Please, review.  IMO it's cut fine enough to make the gradual merge
possible for 2.4 - look and you'll see.
