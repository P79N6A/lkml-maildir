Subject: 2.5.86+: sizes of almost all files in sysfs are 4k?

This confuses some applications (i.e., the midnight commander).
Was this intended?
If the size is not simple/possible to calculate, maybe using 0
would be an option for the cases where the size doesn't carry
any information (like in procfs)?
