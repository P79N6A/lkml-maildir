Of course it is, you said so...

...yourself.  Just send as
	Content-type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Of course a patch like that will usually contain several character sets,
but that's no problem as long as the byte codes are preserved and we can
easily see how the end result looks like.  The important thing is that
the submitter's and committer's MUAs do it right and reviewers' MUAs do
it sort of right.  Also, nobody cares if there is still some pre-WWI
7bit-only MTA operated in some lone desert town.  And if some web
archive of LKML isn't compatible to internet mail, then that's tough luck.
