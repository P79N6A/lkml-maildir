Good. So fix emacs/oracle/pine, and year or so and some time after it
is fixed, we can change kernel defaults. That's still less bad than
having
[ ] Break emacs
in kernel config.

Because if it is configurable, someone _will_ configure it wrong, and
then ask us why it does not work.
And if it is configurable, applications will not get fixed for
basically forever.

I believe that Linus is going to apply this one even less likely.
