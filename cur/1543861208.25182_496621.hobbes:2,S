Maybe we should require taking the page lock before the dirty bits are 
modified? That way we can avoid all the artistic code in there right now. 
It may be even become comprehensible. The page lock and the dirty bit use 
the same cacheline (same word actually), contention is rare and so there 
is likely only a negligible performance impact.
