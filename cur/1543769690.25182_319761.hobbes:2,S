The one exception here is if you have a miswritten sector (usually caused by
unexpected power-down), which won't read back correctly - but running badblocks
with one of the 'write-verify' options will resurrect it.
If you have a drive that has a bad block in it even *after* badblocks has
re-written it, it's time to replace the drive *now*....
For the original poster: Breaking the mirror and then re-mirroring from the
"good" drive *might* recover the bad block when it re-writes it.  But don't bet
on it...
("power fail" is about the only cause of recoverable bad blocks that I know of -
and if you're having power-fail issues on a RAID, I'd recommend you fix
*THAT* problem before it causes you more grief.  A good UPS will more than pay
for itself in sysadmin sanity and peace of mind....)
