You are getting precisely the same thing you got under BitKeeper:  pull 
from X, you get my tree, which was composed from $N repositories.  The 
tree you pull was created by my running 'bk pull' locally $N times.
Ultimately, you appear to be complaining about:
* your own git-pull-script, which doesn't record the $2 (branch) 
argument in the commit message.
* the fact that my changelog includes the merge csets that were 
present-but-invisible by my BitKeeper submissions.  i.e. I lack a 
shortlog that filters out merge csets.

Switching heads around?  It sounds like you did not pull from the branch 
I mentioned.  This is how git-pull-script pulls from a branch:
git-pull-script \
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git\
  refs/heads/for-linus
