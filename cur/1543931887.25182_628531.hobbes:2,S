this is true however it's .. a hard issue. It's really hard to distinguish a duplicate report from
two reports of the same bug.

finding what exact kernel version an oops is from is... surprisingly hard.
And to be honest, bugs against -mm are still very interesting, since they'll be

for the same reason patched kernels are relevant. And if someone has a super weirdo kernel,
well, as long as we get enough bug data it'll be way down in the noise.

That's half of what is done right now; they're not hidden though, just very clearly marked.
