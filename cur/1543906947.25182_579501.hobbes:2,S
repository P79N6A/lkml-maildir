I'm looking for a way to disable the page cache for an
experimental NUMA system running the 2.6.17 kernel. I would prefer to
only disable the page cache for my process and still have it be enabled
by the rest of the system. Is there an easy way of doing this?
Alternatively, I would be fine disabling the Page Cache altogether as well.
Thanks
AK
