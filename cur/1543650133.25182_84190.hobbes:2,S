Ask Intel. There is _no_ technical informations from Intel
about their SpeedStep technology.  All is done for now by guessing,
reverse engeenering, etc.  Only a subset of chipsets can
work for now, and you do not have the one that cpufreq support.
I heard also that it could work soon, but absolutely nothing
is guarantied if Intel continue to withhold their 
documentations.  You can join cpufreq mailing list if
you want to help on this topic.
