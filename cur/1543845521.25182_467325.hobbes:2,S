As a postscript I (unintentionally) bended the truth on that one actually
yesterday. Sorry for that. Semaphores are still inline, unlike spinlocks.
However if the spinlocks are out of line I see no reason to keep semaphores
inline either, so perhaps it would be better to just move them. Then my
argument above would actually work :)
For some reason the unwinder also still seems to get stuck on it :/
