Actually, that's a fairly simple problem (barring disassembling the  
system and attaching a hardware debugger).  You encrypt the root  
filesystem and require a password to boot (See: LUKS).  Debian has  
built-in support for installing onto fs-on-LVM-on-crypt-on-RAID, and  
it works quite well on all the laptops I use regularly.  It's not  
even much of a speed penalty; once you take the overhead of hitting a  
5400RPM laptop drive you can chew thousands of cycles of CPU without  
anybody noticing (much).  Then all you have to do is burn a copy of  
your /boot with bootloader onto some read-only media (like a  
finalized CDROM/DVDROM) and you're set to go.
