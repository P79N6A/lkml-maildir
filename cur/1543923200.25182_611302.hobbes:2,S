Oh neat, I missed that case, thanks for pointing it out.

Hm.  It's annoying, but I'm not convinced it's *that* annoying.  We're
not trying to predict whether a deadlock could arise as the result of
future behavior.  We're just trying to determine whether granting the
current lock request results in an immediate deadlock consisting purely
of posix file locks.
But yes, I'm assume it's possible, for example, that a thread-exit could
race with a lock request, with the result that we see no deadlock at the
time we handle the lock request, even though at that point the last task
with the ability to solve the problem is already exiting.
Supposing that we're willing to permit the request in such cases and
return EDEADLK only in cases where we're positive there's a deadlock, is
there still some useful subset of cases where we could return EDEADLK?
For example, could we take note of tasks that, when they block on a
lock, have a current->files with reference count one, and only follow
cycles consisting of such blocks?
I'm still not convinced it's worth the trouble, but I suspect you're
overstating the difficulty.
