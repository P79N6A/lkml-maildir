It's for 
http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/
I have a script that converts each 00-INDEX files into an index.html file, and 
then uses that instead of just a directory listing.  I'm trying to get 
complete coverage (a 00-INDEX file for each directory), although what I 
really need is no directories with _partial_ 00-INDEX files (because then 
using index.html instead of showing the directory listing would hide files).
If you want this directory to be special and _not_ have a 00-INDEX file, 
that's fine by me.  It screws up my 404 link checker, but I can hardwire in 
an exception for you...

That line was cut and paste from the first line of boot-options.txt.  If you'd 
like to suggest another description, I'm all ears and can update the patch to 
touch boot-options.txt at the same time.

*shrug*  Ok.
