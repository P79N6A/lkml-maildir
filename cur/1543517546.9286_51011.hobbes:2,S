Where did you get this requirement from? That isn't what
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt appears to indicate.
It gives a prototype of
         bus_addr = virt_to_bus(virt_addr);
and even the examples don't seem to indicate that it is anything other than
an address that is passed in.
When you say you must use virt_to_bus(page), I'm guessing you mean that the
address must be page aligned.
