Absolutely correct.

I thought you are afraid about the case of a totally random input which 
may *grow* after it has been compressed.

Err, it looks like we've lost the conversation flow. :-) I commented 
your phrase: "The question is what happens when you compress 1 1GiB 
input buffer into a 1GiB output buffer."
Then could you please in a nutshell write what worries you or what issue 
you would like to clarify?
IIRC, you worried that in case of a large input and output 12 bytes 
won't be enough. I argued it should. I'm even going to check this soon :-)
