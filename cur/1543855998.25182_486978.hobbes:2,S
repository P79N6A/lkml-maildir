Ah, sorry, I didn't realise that I should be doing that. I guess its
because my desktop doesn't have the git tree on it, so I tend to copy
them over & send by hand. I need to look into automating the send
process anyway as its taking me too much time with large patch sets, so
I'll try and have that fixed for next time,
Steve.
