I think there was misunderstanding between us.
On off-list, I meant:
  o Your original problem was CD burning, and it looked same problem
    being discussed on this thread, according to this message:
> cdrecord: Warning: controller returns zero sized CD capabilities page.
> cdrecord: Warning: controller returns wrong page 0 for CD capabilities page (2A). 
    So I suggested you to watch this thread and try patches of this
    thread for CD burning problem.
  o The problem of ide_cd_check_ireason looked different from
    CD burning one.
    So I suggested you to report it as a different problem.
Thanks,
