under the dumb question department:
a) bad cable?
b) not negotiating speed and duplex with the switch correctly?
c) bad card?
d) IRQ sharing causing a conflict?
I'm less predisposed to blame the card in general or the driver, as I have
probably about a dozen SMC epic100 cards here, in single processor x86,
dual x86, and dual alphas that have been flawless from about 2.2.14 to
2.4.4.
