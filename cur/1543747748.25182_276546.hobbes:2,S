Sorry for not answering to this.
What I say is *yes*, let's try it.
However, I know that ia64 is different because I read that in Fedora 2 kernel 
RPM specs:
#
# IA64 wants to be different as usual.. sigh.
#
%ifarch ia64
%define image_install_path boot/efi/EFI/redhat
%else
%define image_install_path boot
%endif
that should be done with a "ARCH_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PATH" set by archs and the 
main Makefile taking it by default. (Or even without indirection).
