It's always a tradeoff - we've put things in task_struct before to get
around sticky situations.  Certainly, removing potentially unbounded stack
utilisation is a worthwhile thing to do.
The patch bends my brain a bit.  Shouldn't the queueing happen in
submit_bio()?
Is bi_next free in there?  If anyone tries to do synchronous I/O things
will get stuck.
