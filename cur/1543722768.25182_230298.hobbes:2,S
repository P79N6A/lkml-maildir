Those are what gas calls absolute symbols.

Does this only happen in your world?  Or were you using a broken
non-GNU linker?
drow@nevyn:~% cat a.s
BUF = 0x1
code:
        mov %eax, 0
drow@nevyn:~% as -o a.o a.s  
drow@nevyn:~% as -o b.o a.s
drow@nevyn:~% ld -o a a.o b.o
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000008048074
drow@nevyn:~% nm a.o
00000001 a BUF
00000000 t code
drow@nevyn:~% nm a
00000001 a BUF
00000001 a BUF
08049084 A __bss_start
08049084 A _edata
08049084 A _end
08048074 t code
0804807c t code
LD won't even warn about duplicate absolute symbols unless they have
different values.
