Subject: [patch 02/11] mutex subsystem, add asm-generic/mutex-[dec|xchg|null].h implementations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/23/80

Add three (generic) mutex fastpath implementations.
The mutex-xchg.h implementation is atomic_xchg() based, and should
work fine on every architecture.
The mutex-dec.h implementation is atomic_dec_return() based - this
one too should work on every architecture, but might not perform the
most optimally on architectures that have no atomic-dec/inc instructions.
The mutex-null.h implementation forces all calls into the slowpath. This
is used for mutex debugging, but it can also be used on platforms that do
not want (or need) a fastpath at all.
