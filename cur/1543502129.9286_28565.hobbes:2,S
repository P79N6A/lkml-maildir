I am 99% sure.
I wrote many drivers for windows and know, why they crashes :-)
For example, in NT you can safely filter OPENs.
But safe filtering CLOSEs (I skip the details) is not documented.
These situations (I have MANY examples) force developers to resort to
hacks.
I don't know any other drivers-related problems.

An unexpected idea %-/. Are you sure?
Hooks must be transparent by definition.
M$ hooks are opaque due to compatibility problems and dishonest
competition.

Cool :-)

What compatibility problems?

experiment 1: Add new operator to the shell. (meaning 'hooks' - extensible)
     Copy one file to /bin
experiment 2: Add new operator to VB. (meaning 'no hooks' - not extensible)
     Err...
Feel the difference.
> And IMHO easy way to add new features will make it much uglier fast...
The hard to add new features system is M$-DOS.
     Hmm... Hack's paradise.
The most extensible system is UNIX.
     30 years alive - thousands of new features.

Who is not? ;-)
               Best regards.
