None of the people on the CC: list maintain the networking
code, I have no idea where you've obtained that outdated
contact information.  Eric hasn't done networking work for
at least 4 or 5 years, and it's been a similarly long time
since I've ever used that old rutgers.edu address for myself.
Also, linux-kernel is not the place for networking patches
and discussion, linux-net and netdev are.
