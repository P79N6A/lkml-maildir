2.6.6-mm2 does indeed fix the EHCI problem and those messages; I guess I 
didn't read the patches closely enough. Instead, though, I have a new 
problem related to suspend/resume in 2.6.6-mm2 where an attached USB 
mouse will stop responding after a resume, but unplugging & plugging the 
device back in will work fine.
I was going to send a message off to usb-devel about it, but Thunderbird 
ended up losing my entire e-mail and I was too lazy to re-type it.
