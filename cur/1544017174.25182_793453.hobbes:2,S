That's right.  You did rm -rf dir, which is actually the slowest
possible way to remove the snapshot ;)  A much more optimized version is
possible, and already implemented as part of transaction commit.
But, the fast version is basically the same as unlinking a directory
that may or may not be in use.  We need to implement code to do that
properly wrt the VFS.

A very good point, I'm in the process of documenting this better.

Unfortunately not, sorry.
