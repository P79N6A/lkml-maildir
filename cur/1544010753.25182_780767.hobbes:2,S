Paul, I think your analysis is correct. This is likely what is happening.
Not that timec could not use ptrace() to block the task from executing
its first instruction, but you'd still have a problem because of prctl(ENABLE)
which applies to the current task, not another task, unless I am mistaken.
Prctl() looks odd to me because you have all those supposedly independent
file descriptors to identify events you want to measure, but they are not
used to start/stop. If you are attaching to multiple tasks at the same time
which you can do with the current API,  you may not necessarily want to
start/stop all counters at the same time.
Looks like prctl() is not what we want after all...
