Malcom Mallardi posted a note around the same time describing the same
problem.  Wayne Whitney suggested that Malcom add his disk to the "problem
disk" list in pdc202xx.c, and Malcom reports that it worked.  I did the
same thing for my disk, with the same results.
I enclose two patches against the 2.4.14 kernel.  The first patch just adds
both problem disks to the list.  The second assumes that all disks in the
appropriate Quantum families are a problem.  My vote is for the second one.
