I don't believe #3 is necessary.  At any given point in a lock's
existence, it's:
(a) blocking on an active lock (attached to its blocking lock through
    fl_block, attached to the list of blocked locks through fl_link,
    and pointing at its blocking lock with fl_next)
(b) an active lock (attached to any locks blocking on it through
    fl_block, attached to the list of global locks through fl_link and
    pointing at the next active lock with fl_next).
So I can't see the need for a reference count.  We always know where
it's referenced from and what its lifecycle is.  I'm not surprised
you're confused though -- locks.c is still a mess.  I think I've got
some improvements, but I'm waiting for OSDL to give me access to a quad
CPU machine to test on.

I prefer a single global lock.  Yes, it will be held for longer than
necessary if you had a per-inode lock, but it doesn't bloat struct inode
any more than it currently is.  Also, there's never a lock inversion
issue, which I believe the algorithm you describe below has.
Insert lock is grab inode-file-lock for write, grab global-file-lock for write,
insert lock, release both.
Display locks is grab global-file-lock for read, grab inode-file-lock for
read, display information, release both.
so insert grabs inode lock, display grabs global lock, insert spins
waiting for exclusive access, display spins waiting for the exclusive
access to be released.  Boom.

The cost will still be high.  The N in the approach you want to take
is roughly the number of locks existing in the system (each lock has
to be checked to see whether any lock is currently blocking on it).
The N in the current approach is the number of locks which are currently
blocking in the system.  Since a task can only be blocking on one lock,
this is the number of tasks in the system currently blocking on a lock.
I think you underestimate how big a difference this really is.
Typically, there are maybe 8 processes blocked on locks (those apache
children using it as a mutex ;-).  O(N^2) for this case is O(64).
If we're talking about a system which is big enough that this kind of
lock scalability makes a difference, there must be thousands of locks
being taken and released every second.  O(N^2) would be O(1000000),
with a global lock held -- 15000 times longer!
