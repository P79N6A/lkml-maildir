Hi Grant,
thanks for the analysis. It's good to know not to deactivate the NIC. I
never knowingly encoutered any real problem, but maybe there may been
other of problems which I did not attribute to the NIC. Normally I do
not deactivated the interface, but up to a few weeks ago the DHCP daemon
could do this in order to change the IP number. Now this is over and I
have since then a fixed IP number (because I am directly connected to
the DSLAM of my ISP, this is called "degroupage" in France as opposed to
IP/ADSL where one is only indirectly connected with Franc-Telecom). 
I am actually using a "Freebox" as a modem which has recently, `let's
say', arisen some interest in the linux-kernel mailing list because it
runs Linux inside: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109936781417837&w=2
For the NIC I have mentioned in my first message that I have two NICs,
the other being a 3Com card which is mostly likely better. I will simply 
switch the roles between my first and the second interface by exchanging
the aliases for eth0/1 in modprobes.conf. Then I use the Sitecom card
with the tulip driver only for the internal connection which is never
shut down and not so often used.
Greetings, Klaus.
