I have a pci board in development that works but..
it can not share the interrupt line.  
Has someone hacked through the problem of reserving one of the inta, intb, .. 's for a single device?  I would love to see how you did so I could continue on with my driver while I wait for the !@$#!@ hardware guys to fix the board. 
Thanks for the help,
Tom Rix
