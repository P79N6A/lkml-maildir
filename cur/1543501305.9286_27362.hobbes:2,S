Hi, everybody!
I did ask Linus this question once upon a time and got an answer that it
does not got rid of 'coz nobody insisted. I did but with no result. Now I'd
like to ask this question again. I mean kernel boot error messages when
changing root from initrd to the real root. Those messages seems don't make
any harm, but it's not a good thing to have them in kernel logs anyway. This
is my recent kernel (2.2.10-ac5) log excerpt:
