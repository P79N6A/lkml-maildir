sky2 works for my card in 2.6.16-rc5:
GSI 21 sharing vector 0x32 and IRQ 21
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:00.0[A] -> GSI 30 (level, low) -> IRQ 50
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:02:00.0 to 64
sky2 v0.15 addr 0xff2fc000 irq 50 Yukon-EC (0xb6) rev 1
sky2 eth0: addr 00:00:5a:70:86:49
sky2 0000:02:00.0: No interrupt was generated using MSI, switching to
INTx mode. Please report this failure to the PCI maintainer and include
system chipset information.
uli526x: ULi M5261/M5263 net driver, version 0.9.3 (2005-7-29)
GSI 22 sharing vector 0x42 and IRQ 22
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 66
eth1: ULi M5263 at pci0000:00:11.0, 00:13:8f:78:b3:32, irq 66.
I do have Message Signalled Interrupts enabled, and PCIe, although MSI
doesn't seem to work. Possibly not supported on my ULi motherboard
(Asrock 939Dual-Sata2, M1689/M1563 chipset).
dmesg and lspci attached.
