Ok, the resistor on the board is 100ohm, which is too big
according to the docs of the extender.
So what I tried is to connect a 10ohm resistor between
IDSEL and the AD pin, on the extender itself. But it didn't
do the trick. It still doesn't work.
I also connected a 10ohm resistor between IDSEL and the AD
pin directly on the mainboard. Also doesn't work. So I guess
it's some other issue.
But I have no idea what could be wrong besides that.
