You can't.

So, I am not allowed to distribute my program with a license which changes
the first two lines to say "Jeff's Public License\\ Version 2, December
1998" and strikes the paragraph about using other version numbers.
In other words, the GPL is not itself covered by the GPL. (And, if it were,
which version would it be covered by?:)
However, I might be able to write the Gnu GPL in "COPYING.GNU" and in
"COPYING" (and elsewhere prominently) write that this software is
copyrighted under the terms specified in "COPYING.GNU" with certain
modifications.  Thus, the document describing the GNU GPL isn't modified,
but I do describe the license I desire in terms of the GPL.

The distinction between true and false appears to become increasingly
blurred by... the pollution of the language.
