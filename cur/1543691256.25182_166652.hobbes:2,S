Hi,
We used the new hfsplus driver lately. However it showed lots 
of files which had a "/" in the filename. Yes in the fileNAME. 
ls would find a file called "a/b" and then stat it, but no directory
"a" would then be found....
I tried modifying the unicode->ascii strcpy function, which I saw
being called in the "readdir" code. That somehow didn't work,
although I think it should have. (Not that it would have /worked/, but
it should at least have shown "a_b" instead of "a/b") But it didn't. 
I didn't have the time to figure it out, but one of these days
we should mangle those names in a predictable way to make filesystems
like this usable under Linux... Right?
			Roger.
