Of course I read this, but it does not change anything.
NGPT had 2 times slower start time than NPTL, and NTL has 2-20 times
faster than NPTL, so I think NGPT had too major problems to get it 
into comparison.
I described in details why and how M:N model better, and its drawbacks
include all issues mentioned by Ulrich Drepper, but nevertheless its
advantages are far too superiour than those which can be provided by 1:1
model.
