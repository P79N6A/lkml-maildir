A quick solution is to turn off interrupts with a cli() immediately before you
tell the device that you want them.  When you call interuptible_sleep, Linux
will enable interrupts after you are safely in the wait queue, and any pending
interrupts will occur.  To avoid losing interrupts, however, you might want
implement some kind of queue to hold messages.  You would still use a cli() to
make sure everything happened atomically, however.  The correct implementation
really depends on how your device functions.
