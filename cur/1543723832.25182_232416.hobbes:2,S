Hi Tigran, 
This code was added to stop the ptrace/kmod vulnerabilities. I do not 
fully understand the issues around tsk->is_dumpable and the fix itself,
but I agree on that the checks here could be relaxed for the super user.
However changing it to 
        if (!is_dumpable(task) && !capable(CAP_SYS_PTRACE))
                goto out;
Seems wrong because this will stop always honoring the tsk->is_dumpable flag. (?)
Alan for sure can make the picture clear - he wrote this thing.
