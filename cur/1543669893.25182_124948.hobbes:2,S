FYI
Same thing happend on my machine *once*, in the same place
(i.e mounting root fs -- JFS) but i forgot the full report on my home
machine :-(.
Kernel 2.5.67 mm1 compiled by gcc 3.2.2 and booted with "debug"
on kernel command line. Couldn't reproduce it :-(
Machine: Duron 700 MHz, 256 M RAM, chipset Via KT133, ATI Radeon VE QY
graphics card, CS4239 sound card, no ethernet.
Distribution Slackware 8.1 + updates.
