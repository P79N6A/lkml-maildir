We've got an SMP machine running 2.2.12 which was having a hell of a time
running (mem leak!) with 2.2.11 and now 2.2.12. It's got a DAC960 raid device in
it with 12GB of disk for the array and it's serving mail for about 5K users (and
that's all it does). Anyway it has to be re-booted every 8 to 12 hours or it
will fall over because of the leak. Which kernel should we get and run to fix
this? We're currently running 2.2.12-6smp.i686 from the Lorax Beta from Red Hat.
We just installed this kernel today and it appears to have the same problem. I
just checked the box and it was rebooted 47 minutes ago so I guess the new
kernel didn't fix the leak. Here's the meminfo on it:

Okay... I have a box sitting here for testing which has the fdomain.o driver (I
won't take it down or change it until this problem is identified!). Let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.
