Yes there are two calls.  I'm assuming that the retry was caused by the
call w/o holding the i_sem, since pages can be dirtied in parallel.
My debug output shows every filemap_write_and_wait() and which pages are
on the dirty, io, and locked list and which pages are on the clean list
after the wait. (yes, this is lots of output)
I changed the test a little bit -- if the test sees non-zero data, it
opens a new file descriptor and re-reads the data without O_DIRECT and
also re-reads the 1st page of the non-zero data using O_DIRECT.
What the debug output shows is:
The 1st filemap_write_and_wait() writes out some data.
The 2nd filemap_write_and_wait() sees different dirty pages.  The pages
  that are seen non-zero by the test (many pages -- 243 in one case) are
  on the dirty_pages list before the write and on the clean_pages list
  after the wait.  But some of the pages at the end of the clean list,
  are seen by the test program as non-zero.
Since I added the DIO re-read, the debug output shows for the 2nd
  re-read:
the 1st filemap_write_and_wait() with NO dirty pages
the 2nd filemap_write_and_wait() with dirty pages AFTER the pages
  that mis-matched and the original plus these pages on the clean
  list after the wait.
The 2nd re-read and the read without O_DIRECT both get zeroed data.
Conclusions:
===========
I'm not sure. :(
It appears like the pages are put on the clean list and PG_writeback is
cleared while the i/o is in flight and the DIO reads are put on the
queue ahead of the writeback.
I am trying to figure out how to add more debug code to prove this
or figure out what else is going on.
I'm open to suggestions.
