Ahh. Have we verified that the new semantics of that MXCSR_MASK field 
works on non-intel CPU's too?
It would also (in my opinion) make sense to just export the 
"common_mxcsr_mask" (and probably just rename it as "mxcsr_feature_mask" 
or something - where does that "common" come from? Is it just to imply 
that it's the bits that all CPU's support "in common", or what?
Right now you export a function that does just a simple mask operation, 
and quite frankly, that just seems to make it less clear what the code is 
doing. So who not get rid of that "set_fpu_mxcsr()" function, and just 
replace all the "0xffbf" uses with "mxcsr_feature_mask"?
Hmm?
