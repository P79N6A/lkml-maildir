Hi!
I have few questions about v4l api.
I have device (vicam == usb 3com homeconnect camera), which would like to
fit into v4l framework. But... mmap is not really native operation for
usb. Should I emulate it, or just return unsupported and expect
applications to use read()?
Similar problem is there with formats. vicam has some really strange
formats. Should I do conversion in kernel?
Is there some usermode program that can handle camera without mmap
ability and can support arbitrary screen sizes + 16bpp grayscale?
