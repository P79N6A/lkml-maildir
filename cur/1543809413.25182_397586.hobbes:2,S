Well, I did what you asked.  I modified the file, recompiled the
kernel (fbmon.o did get rebuilt), and copied over the kernel.  I don't
see any extra messages in here, however.  I looked through dmesg
elsewhere, and didn't find anything that seemed to relate.  I
double-checked what I did, but no change.  Here's the only stuff I can
find in dmesg that seems to relate to video:
