Understood. I have added a comment about what is going there.
Now, I don't particularly like what we have to do here. You may have a better
solution to my problem:
	- how inside the kernel, can I make sure a thread is stopped and off any CPU?
	- if the thread is not stopped, how do I go about forcing it to stop and how
	  can I get notified when it is eventually off any CPU?
	- how do I make sure it cannot wake up until I am done with it?

Ok, now I understand. I don't think I have that but I will write a test program
and run on all architectures to ensure this is indeed the case.
