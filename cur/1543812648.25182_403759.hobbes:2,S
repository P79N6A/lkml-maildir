If you're looking for nice wording: I forget if it is Linux Device
Drivers, Understanding the Linux Kernel or Linux Kernel Development,
but more or less combined they manage to describe the bastard state of
what struct buffer_head used to be and how bio coming along leaves bh
primarily as mapping between a memory buffer and a disk block.  With
block related things being abstracted cleaner as of 2.6 (and that
hopefully being a continuing goal) I'd vote for any change to this
struct's comment focusing on what the struct is meant to do, not what
abstractions have been (ab)used to accomplish different things over
time.
