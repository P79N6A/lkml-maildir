With a quick glance in that direction it appears to the result
of a design bug in vmnet that they call sk_alloc at all, and someone
seems to have found a work around in vmnet for this situation.
My gut feel is that vmware should just use tun or tap (whichever
is the appropriate one), and be done with it.
