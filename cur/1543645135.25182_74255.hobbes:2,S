Since the serial cleanups happened in 2.5, Magic Sysrq doesn't work 
for me on the serial console.
It looks like the UART_LSR_BI bit needs to be set in the status 
variable for the break character to be interpreted as a break in the 
driver.
I doubt that it is actually broken,  but it isn't immediately obvious 
how that bit gets set.  Is there something that I should have set when 
the device was initialized to make sure that UART_LSR_BI is asserted 
in "status" when the interrupt occurs?
