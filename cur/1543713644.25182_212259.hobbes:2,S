Right.  Names for everything in SERIAL_PORT_DFNS get reserved.  For
boxes with ACPI, we don't need SERIAL_PORT_DFNS at all (assuming you
build with CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACPI).  ia64, for example, doesn't
define SERIAL_PORT_DFNS, so ports just get named sequentially in the
order they're discovered.
The following (untested) patch should give you the same behavior
when you supply the "noisaserial" argument.  Note that this probably
won't work if you're using a serial console, because early serial
registration will fill in the ISA ports before "noisaserial" gets
parsed.
