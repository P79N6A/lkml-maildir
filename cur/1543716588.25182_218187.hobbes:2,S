    It maybe has to do with the lack of zerocopy support (no DMA
transfer) in certain parts of the process. For example, under 2.4.x
you don't have zerocopy when writing audio, and maybe during fixation
DMA is not used, neither. I'm not an expert in this issue, but I
think that it may be the cause.
    Which kernel are you using? Which kind of recorder?
