I've had a waveform generator generate a square wave into an interrupt
input of an ISA card. At 120k interrupts per second the system would
noticably slow down, and at 140k interrupts it would stop. (and
continue once the interrupt frequency was down below the threshold
again).
So, you have about a factor of 25 of margin beyond "4kHz".
