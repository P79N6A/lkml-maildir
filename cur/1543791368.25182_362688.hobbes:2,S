Hello,
at Opteron-based x86_64 system sometimes I get message
Machine check events logged
(non-fatal). How can I read the correspondent events? From the source
code (arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c) it sounds like some misc device with
MISC_MCELOG_MINOR 227 is registered (with name "mcelog"?), but there is
no such device under /dev.
Thank you.
