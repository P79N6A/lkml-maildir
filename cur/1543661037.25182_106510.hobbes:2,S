Yes, that's the case.

With most hardware and the current driver, you will still receive an ENUM#
signal if you flip a card's toggle open after echoing 0 into its power 
file.  Since the write to the slot's power file triggers unconfiguration 
of the driver for the attached device and removal of the kernel's PCI 
representation, pulling the card out then triggers the improper removal 
detection logic.  I should probably only honor the write of 0 to the 
power file for devices that are in extracting state via a toggle flip, 
I'll experiment a bit to see if that model works.
However, if the peripheral card in question is a ZT5541, all bets are off,
since in my experiments here it seems to completely shut down when its
hotswap LED is toggled.  I'm pretty sure this makes it non-compliant with
PICMG 2.1, but have not decided yet if disabling the attention file is 
worthwhile.  We could probably live without the attention file to toggle
the LED, and theoretically disable_slot should not need to call cpci_led_on
since clearing EXT is supposed to turn on the LED, but I've not seen 
enough peripheral hardware yet to have a feel for how safe it would be to
rely on things working correctly on all boards.
