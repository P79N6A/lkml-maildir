Cisco etherchannel does this, by XOR'ing the dest address with the
source address, AND'ing with # of interfaces (limiting you to a power of
2), and then using the number to determine what channel to use.
Now, you end up in a 4 way Etherchannel, all the traffic going down one
channel, and the none going down the other three.  Does that sound like
a balanced solution?
Most bonding problems are either the card driver is busted, the card is
busted (el-cheapo NE2000 PCI clones are really bad..) or the switch
can't handle it.  Most cheap, dumb switches break big time when using
Bonding with them.
