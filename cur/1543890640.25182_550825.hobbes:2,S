Look at how slow the raid benchmarks are in dmesg with 8GB of memory!
[   59.592560] raid6: using algorithm sse2x4 (476 MB/s)
[   59.597558] raid5: using function: generic_sse (56.000 MB/sec)
Yikes!
With mem=4096M:
[   60.336352] raid6: using algorithm sse2x4 (6804 MB/s)
[   60.341345] raid5: using function: generic_sse (8552.000 MB/sec)
What is going on here?
Justin.
