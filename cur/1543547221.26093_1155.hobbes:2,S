Every morning at 00:00:00, I have cron set my system clock to
NIST (time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov). Then I use hwclock to set
the hardware clock to the new system time.
# Min Hour Day Month Day_of_week Command
#
0 0 * * * /usr/local/sbin/nettime time-A.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov >>/var/adm/set_time.log;/sbin/hwclock --systohc >>/var/adm/set_time.log
`nettime` is `rdate` that shows the time before and after it's set.
This has worked very well with a relatively old version of Linux,
linux-2.2.6. The time of my server has always been within about 10
seconds of NIST.
I upgraded my server to: 
Linux boneserver 2.2.15 #22 SMP Fri Aug 25 17:31:25 EDT 2000 i686
Now the time is diverging. Every night, the time is further and
further from NIST, just before it is set.
The current contents of /etc/adjtime shows that the last time hwclock
set the time, it was 394 seconds off:
	-394.634766 967724179 0.000000
	967724179
This is a bit much. Water-clocks are more accurate than this.
This may be a "set-back-time" problem because the kernel thinks
that it's midnight, the time gets set back roughly 6 minutes,
then there may be a problem when it's midnight again, 6 minutes
later. Just a WAG.
Is this a known problem?
Should I just zero out or remove /etc/adjtime and see if it starts
to converge?
Should we always zero out or remove /etc/adjtime during an upgrade to handle
possible code changes?
FYI, I just deleted /etc/adjtime and created a new one with hwclock.
I will see what it does tonight.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
