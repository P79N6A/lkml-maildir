Last time I tested (around 2.6.12), eepro100 worked much better 
in -rt kernels w.r.t. latencies than e100:
e100 caused a periodic latency of about 500 microseconds
exactly every 2 seconds, no matter what the load on the interface
was (i.e. even on an idle interface).
eepro100 did not show any latencies that long, it worked much
smoother w.r.t. latencies.
Of course I would prefer to have e100 fixed over keeping eepro100
around forever, but the last time I checked, it still wasn't fixed.
