Um, only if your idea is limited to authorized capabilities and paths.
If you actually want to circumscribe the full behavior of the program
(e.g. IPC, inter-process operations), you don't have the necessary
enforcement mechanism.

If it uses that path as the argument, then yes (although to be clear, AA
operates at file level and skips directory write/search checking, IIUC
from the code - see aa_filter_mask).  But you don't know whether or not
it can write to the same file via another path that is included in its
profile.

So you are only worried about script kiddies?  Further, once someone
crafts an exploit specifically targeting AA, knowing full well its
limitations, that exploit will become fodder for the kiddies as well.
If a security mechanism only prevents attacks that weren't designed
against it, what good is it aside from a temporary stopgap?

Why can't you use existing virtualization solutions ala Vservers or
OpenVZ or whatever?
