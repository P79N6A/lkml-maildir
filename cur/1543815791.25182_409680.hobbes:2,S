This change is only for i386.. check the patch, its introduced only for arch/i386/Kconfig
There is no change to x86_64, we anyway choose physflat mode in x86_64 which is exactly 
same as bigsmp in i386.
We didnt change anything in x86_64...Why this speculation :(
Iam attaching that patch for your reference here... in case you lost it and looking at 
some other patch. :-)
Could you _please_ really check this and tell me if there is real concern... its pretty
simple patch... no other arch is affected...
This patch makes CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU depend on !X86_PC, so we need to turn on 
either CONFIG_GENERICARCH, CONFIG_BIGSMP or any other subarch except X86_PC
With 2.6.15+ kernels when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is turned on we switch to bigsmp mode for
sending IPI's and ioapic configurations that caused the following error message.
>> More than 8 CPUs detected and CONFIG_X86_PC cannot handle it.
>> Use CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH or CONFIG_X86_BIGSMP.
Originally bigsmp was added just to handle >8 cpus, but now with hotplug cpu support
we need to use bigsmp mode (why? see below), that cause the above error message even 
if there were less than 8 cpus in the system.
The message is bogus, but we are cannot use logical flat mode due to issues with
broadcast IPI can confuse a CPU just comming up. We use flat physical mode just like x86_64
case. More details on why bigsmp now uses flat physical mode (vs. cluster mode)
in following link.
