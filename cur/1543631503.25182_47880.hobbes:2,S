This patch can also be applied against 2.4.19-pre8-ac5.
The patch command does report:
patching file arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 124 (offset 27 lines).
Since this missing lock is completely unrelated to the
other bugfixes in vm86 I don't expect any bad interactions.
The pagetable access in arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c is related
to another access in arch/i386/mm/fault.c. Did anybody
verify that the other file does correct locking?
