Linux used to use segmentation to do something like this; %fs was set up 
to point to the user address space in the kernel, and accesses to 
userspace used an %fs segment override.  This history is still visible 
in the naming of get/set_fs (which has nothing to do with filesystems).

By "real" I assume you mean "physical".  What you're suggesting is 
something akin to highmem, but applied to all memory.  With highmem, the 
kernel can't assume it has direct access to all physical memory, and you 
must explicitly map it in with kmap() to use it.  You could do this with 
all memory all the time, but with an obvious performance (and 
complexity) overhead.

Well, if you're mapping kernel+physical memory at low addresses, it 
means that userspace moves about depending on where you want to put the 
user/kernel split.  That's a lot harder to deal with than just moving 
around the limit.
The load address for ET_EXEC executables is defined as 0x08048000; you 
can use ET_DYN if you want to load them elsewhere.  Using lower 
addresses allows the use of instructions with smaller pointers and 
offsets (though this might be less important on x86).  x86-64's normal 
compilation model requires non-relocatable code to be in the lower 
2Gbytes, for example.

I'm pointing out that the existing design has a reasonable technical 
justification, and is not somebody's arbitrary personal choice.  There 
are certainly other possible designs, with their own pros and cons.
