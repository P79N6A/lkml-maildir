Hello, i have a very similar problem with 2.6.21 also;
2 3com NICs and they are failling randomly.
The kernel is a basic fedora 7 kernel (2.6.21-1.3228.fc7)
I found a bug report and added details here : 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=243960
I'm not subcribed on this list, so please cc me if there is any questions.
