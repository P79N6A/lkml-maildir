I would suggest trying to do a "pci_enable_device(dev);" at the very top
of ohci_pci_resume(). It sounds like your suspend/resume doesn't
re-enable PCI interrupt routing, and doing the device enable will make
the kernel re-route the interrupt for you.
If that helps, please send me the tested patch, and forward it to the
appropriate USB people too.
