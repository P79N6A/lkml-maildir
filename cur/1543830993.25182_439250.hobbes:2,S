The "buffering within taskstats" might be a way out then.
As long as the user is willing to pay the price in terms of memory, we 
can collect the exiting task's
taskstats data but not send it immediately (taskstats_cache would grow) 
unless a high water mark had
been crossed. Otherwise a timer event would do the sends of accumalated 
taskstats (not all at once but
iteratively if necessary).
At task exit, despite doing a few rounds of sending of pending data, if 
netlink were still reporting errors
then it would be a sign of unsustainable rate and the pending queue 
could be dropped and a message
like you suggest could be sent.
Thoughts ?
