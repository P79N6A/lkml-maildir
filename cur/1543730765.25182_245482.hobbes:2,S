What it breaks is the concept of a file. In ways that are ill-defined,
not portable, hard to work with, and needlessly complex. Along the
way, it breaks every single application that ever thought it knew what
a file was.
Progress? No, this has been done before. Various dead operating
systems have done it or similar and regretted it. Most recently MacOS,
which jumped through major hurdles to begin purging themselves of
resource forks when they went to OS X. They're still there, but
heavily deprecated.

Find some silly person with an iBook and open a shell on OS X. Use cp
to copy a file with a resource fork. Oh look, the Finder has no idea
what the new file is, even though it looks exactly identical in the
shell. Isn't that _wonderful_? Now try cat < a > b on a file with a
fork. How is that ever going to work?
I like cat < a > b. You can keep your progress.
