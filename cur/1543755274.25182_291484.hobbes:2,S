I was anticipating some people would have this requirement, and this
is why I introduced the ad-hoc mode. Roman asked me to get rid of it
because nobody had yet asked for it, so this is why it was dropped.
As it is, the implementation you are suggesting is insufficient for
LTT, which is relayfs' first formal client. I think that it would be
better to provide two underlying mechanisms for relayfs at this point,
we had already stripped it as thin as it would go for things like LTT.

Actually that's not true. There are two problems with this statement:
a- It requires prepackaged data units.
b- It's only useful for fixed-size data units.
Any efficient client that has complex data units will want to write
directly into the buffer instead of creating an intermediate package
which is then memcopied. With the modified code, we are now forced
to create an intermediate package, which is wrong. Also, if the client
wants to log variable-size events, he would have to re-implement lots
of the writing code.
Note that I really think relay_write() should be dropped altogether.
Clients should call on relay_reserve() and do whatever is necessary
after that.

I understand the point you are trying to make, but I really think that
this is best implemented as two separate buffering schemes instead of
breaking the existing one (which had already been trimmed down quite
thin following Roman's input.)

For the kind of data sizes we are looking at for LTT (100GBs) splitting
buffers is not viable anyway.
