Sorry, I didn't mean to be cryptic and it's really nothing deep.  It's
just that in the past Dave Miller used, let's say, "colorful" language
whenever someone mentioned the fact that the original Itanium machines
didn't have a hardware I/O TLB.  The new Itanium 2 machines from hp
have a chipset with heritage from pa-risc, so they don't have this
limitation (to be fair to Intel though, I don't think the lack of a hw
I/O TLB is a huge issue anymore, given that nowadays you can readily
find all kinds of PCI controllers that support DAC, including network
adapters).
