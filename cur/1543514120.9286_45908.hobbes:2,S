If using bash, consider typing
rm -rfi ???
and then press TAB.  bash will now complete the filename,
and escape it properly (i.e. giving you something like rm -rf
\?\?\?\?\?.......)
You can then press enter.  A properly escaped filename doesn't
match any other files, no matter how many "*"'s "?" and so on it
contains.

You are too nice.  Give them a file called "-fr ~/*" without quotes.
The -fr part puts it before the "-i" file some people use as a
safequard.
The ~/ part means it works from subdirectories too...
