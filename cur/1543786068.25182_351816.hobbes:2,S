I'm pretty sure 2.4.x should have the mmap_sem too.
But I think there it's aquired by the caller of dup_mmap() (ie it's 
"copy_mm()" that gets the mmap_sem and holds it for the duration of 
dup_mmap).
In fact, I'm sure: the mmap_sem was changed from a regular semaphore to a
read-write semaphore in 2.4.2.5, and we definitely took it around
dup_mmap() at that point. 
Of course, maybe some broken change removed it later in 2.4.x, I don't 
keep a current 2.4.x tree around.
