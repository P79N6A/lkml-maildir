I hope you understand, that such things do not make anything secure. 
Administrator of the node will always have access to /proc/kcore, 
devices, KERNEL CODE(!) etc. No security from this point of view.

Why are you interested in nesting? Any applications for this?
Until everything is virtualized in nesting way (including TCP/IP stack, 
routing etc.) I see no much use of it.

Huh, it sounds too easy. Just imagine that VPS owner has deleted ps, 
top, kill, bash and other tools. You won't be able to enter. Another 
example when VPS owner is near its resource limits - you won't be able 
to do anything after VPS entering.
Do you need other examples?
