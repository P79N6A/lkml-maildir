For IA32/i386/x86:
The Linus-kernel only supports a maximum of 15 Pentium IIIs
due to APIC addressing (4 bits, with 0xf meaning "broadcast").
Pentium 4 uses 0xff for broadcast, so lots more of them can
be supported (when you can find a P-4 MP server).
I have heard of some IBM/Sequent patches that modify the
logical vs. physical APIC addressing scheme to make 16-way
systems work.
