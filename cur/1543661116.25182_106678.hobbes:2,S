Perhaps this is a small bug: During a compile for 2.4.20 there comes a section in /include/linux/kernel.h that calls for #include <stdarg.h> however stdarg.h is not included or found in any of the source directories. I cannot go on with my kernel make without this as it fails every 'make bzImage' any suggestions. I have included my makemenuconfig file for examination. What does stdarg.h call for on and where can I get this file if needed?
