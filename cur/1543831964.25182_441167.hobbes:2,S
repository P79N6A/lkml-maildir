I see precisely what you describe in newly submitted network _drivers_, 
too.  People use volatile to cover up missing barriers; to attempt to 
cover up missing flushes (needing readl after a writel); to hide the 
fact that the driver sometimes uses writel() and sometimes just does a 
direct de-ref into MMIO space.
To my view, seeing "volatile" in code is often a "I was too lazy to 
debug the code" or "I was too lazy to make my code portable" situation.
