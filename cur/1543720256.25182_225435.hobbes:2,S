Several solutions:
1. Don't do it.
Is it really a problem? How about using fb1 when you want to use
the AGP card?
2. Use modules, and load the AGP module first.  It will then
grap fb0.  Then load the pci module, which becomes fb1
3. Use the flexibility that /dev offers. fb0 don't have to
be the first framebuffer, in other words:
cd /dev
mv fb0 temp
mv fb1 fb0
mv temp fb1
From now on, the name "fb0" actually refer to the second framebuffer.
any program that wants "fb0" get the AGP card, even if it is
initialized last.
4. Or use udev to achieve the same as in (3).
