True, but that way we also get the consistent rules wrt. async/sync.

We might as well do it in create_empty_buffers(), FWIW. Do you see any
case when it would mean extra work? I'm thinking about the following:
	if (page is uptodate)
		do get_block(...,0) for all buffers and mark them uptodate
in the end of buffer-ring creation. Comments?
