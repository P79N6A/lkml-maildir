I agree that that is abusing the interface. WTF does spawn_ksoftirqd have 
to do with filesystems? 
The purpose of the initcall levels in the first place was to start 
removing the ugly conditional calls in init/main.c I looked at what was 
being called, and came up with names to describe what was being done at 
each phase. There happened to be seven of them.
I knew from the start that people would feel that they were more important 
that others, and leapfrog their initcalls before everyone else. We're 
egotistical; that's what we do. But remember, just because it's there, 
doesn't mean you have to use it. 
That said, it's been a while since I've really looked at it. I favor a 
mechanism for getting the ordering right. I don't really like having to 
specify the dependencies in the definitions; I think it's kinda ugly and 
wonder if there is an automatic way to resolve them. I don't have any 
ideas, nor the time to play with it, so it remains still just a pipe 
dream...
