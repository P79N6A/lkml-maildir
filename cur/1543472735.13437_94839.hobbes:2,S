I want to exchange a lot of data between two x86-PCs.
The only options I see are : parallel port , serial port and USB.
serial would work , but it is too slow.
parallel might be better , but what is the state of support in
the linux kernel ? Is EPP supported ? ECP ?
Does PLIP work with ECP/EPP ?
Does any other file-transfer program work over ECP/EPP ?
USB : Is it supported yet ?
Can I set up a point-to-point TCP/IP connection over it ?
( LapLink support connecting two PCs over USB under windows,
they sell a special cable for that , not avaliable anywhere 
else , at least their webpage says so )
