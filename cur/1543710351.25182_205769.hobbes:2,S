Switched CPUs. This time I get the following:
CPU3: Machine Check Exception: 000.0004
CPU2: Machine Check Exception: 000.0004
Bank 0: a20000008c010400
Kernel Panic: CPU context corrupt
In idle task - not syncing
Note that the CPU# designations are swapped and that there's only one Bank 0: 
message. Is this significant?
