threadlets (and syslets) are parallel contexts and they behave so - 
queuing and execution semantics are then ontop of that, implemented 
either by glibc, or implemented by the application. There is no 
'pipeline' of requests imposed - the structure of pending requests is 
totally free-form. For example in threadlet-test.c i've in essence 
implemented a 'set of requests' with the submission site only interested 
in whether all requests are done or not - but any stricter (or even 
looser) semantics and ordering can be used too.
in terms of AIO, the best queueing model is i think what the kernel uses 
internally: freely ordered, with barrier support. (That is equivalent to 
a "queue of sets", where the queue are the barriers, and the sets are 
the requests within barriers. If there is no barrier pending then 
there's just one large freely-ordered set of requests.)
