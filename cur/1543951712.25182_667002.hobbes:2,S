Nope, still blows up with exactly the same traceback.
I may have to try again to figure out how to bisect the git-x86 tree - Ingo
send me a pointer to his git-x86 cheat sheet, I looked at it but I couldn't
figure out how to tell 'git bisect' that the starting good spot was "whatever
corresponded to the git-x86 patch in 24-rc8-mm1" and bad was "25-rc3-mm1". I
tried using the first commit ID listed in the patch, but that gave me this:
(looking at first few lines of the git-x86.patch in the 25-rc3-mm1 broken-out):
commit fa70e201463a7f3d86b995249e57a8e27b31b5f8
Author: Paolo Ciarrocchi <paolo.ciarrocchi@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 24 11:57:22 2008 +0100
but then:
% git bisect bad fa70e201463a7f3d86b995249e57a8e27b31b5f8
fatal: Needed a single revision
Bad rev input: fa70e201463a7f3d86b995249e57a8e27b31b5f8
And I didn't see any release tags in the x86 git tree that I could specify
either.
(Once I get the good and bad markers set, it "should be easy" - I've managed
to git-bisect through Linus's git tree before, but that was always easy
because "bad" was HEAD and "good" had a nice v2.6.2mumble-rcN tag to specify...
