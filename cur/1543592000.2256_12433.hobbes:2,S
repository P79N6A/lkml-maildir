They are entirely different. Too different sets of operations.

Not really. For struct block_device you have partitioning stuff sitting
nearby. It should be handled by generic code. Nothing of that kind for
character devices.
But the main point is that for block devices ->read() and ->write() do
not belong to the natural interface. Request queue does. They are about
as far from each other as from FIFOs and sockets.

That's simply wrong. kdev_t is used for unopened objects quite often.
