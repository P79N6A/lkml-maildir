Dirty ratio cannot be set to less than 5%. See 
mm/page-writeback.c:get_dirty_limits().

We also have an issue with cpusets. Dirty page throttling does not work in 
a cpuset if it is relatively small to the total memory on the system since 
we calculate the percentage of the total memory and not a percentage of 
the memory the process is allowed to use.
