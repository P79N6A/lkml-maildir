Subject: Kernal Panic while reading loop device.

In Kernel 2.5.1-pre3, I receive a kernal panic whenever I execute the 
following two commands.  This panic does not occur in 2.5.1-pre1.  The 
stock kernel has been patched with Alan Cox's pc_keyb.c patch and with 
the early_printk patch.
I don't have time tonite to revert the early_printk patch and see if the 
panic still happens.  If anyone thinks it is relevant, I will try this 
tomorrow without the early_printk patch.
If anyone would like more information, please let me know.

The commands which generate the panic are:
losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/scd0
cat /dev/loop0
/dev/scd0 contains a CD-RW burned using the text "This is a test." as 
the image.
Here is my transcription of the panic message: (Apologies for any 
write-p's, it was transcribed by hand).
