Just install Linux from a current distribution, i.e., like
RedHat (not an Add, just came-to mind because I don't know
how to spell Suse and/or whatever..). The drivers for IDE/EIDE/RAID
are in their installation kernels. If you are trying to build a kernel
to support EIDE, the problem is figuring out what questions to answer
during configuration. The major distributors have already figured that
out.
You can't do 'BIOS-based' stuff in the kernel (although it's been tried
for what should be simple stuff like APM).
The BIOS code itself often makes assumptions about the environment
like it can plug its interrupt vector into the interrupt table and
enable its ISR.
There can't be, as you say, "a protected mode BIOS interface" for
the same reason nobody does general purpose surgery. Every
protected-mode system is different.
Also, when LILO boots, if it didn't get past Uncompressing, then
booting the kernel, it's NOT a lack of hard-disk support. You
probably have built the kernel for a processor you don't have.
