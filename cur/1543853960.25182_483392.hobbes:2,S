That actually doesn't appear a very useful definition.
There are two reasons for wanting memory guarantees
#1	To be sure a user can't toast the entire box but just their own
	compartment (eg web hosting)
#2	To ensure all apps continue to make progress
The simple approach doesn't seem to work for either. There is a threshold
above which #1 and #2 are the same thing, below that trying to keep a few
pages in memory will thrash not make progress and will harm overall
behaviour thus failing to solve #1 or #2. At that point you have to
decide whether what you have is a misconfiguration or whether the system
should be prepared to do temporary cycling overcommits so containers take
it in turn to make progress when overcommitted.

Thats fundamentally a judgement based on your particular workload and
constraints. If I am web hosting then I don't generally care if my end
users compartment blows up under excess load, I care that the other 200
customers using the box don't suffer and all phone me to complain.
