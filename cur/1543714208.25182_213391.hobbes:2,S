hi all,
i installed windows to check if there is anything happening to the
cardbus registers when working on a supported system... the cardbus
registers, beside the pci registers, are the same as on the linux system
... 
i haven't been able to play back some sounds, because rme's driver disc
only contains the win2k driver ...
i have no idea, what this might tell us ... it's not a very good feeling
if someone who seem to have the same problem as yourself finds the
reason for his problem, but it doesn't seem to be the reason of your
problem ... anyway, let's hope the best...
cheers...

mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,
the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn,
burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across
the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and
everybody goes "Awww!"
