I'm getting a problem in usb-storage (it's loaded as a module towards the end
of the boot sequence).  The module locks during initialisation, which doesn't
happen in 2.4.17.
(is it possible to unload a crashed module without rebooting?
 This happens so often with SCSI... )
The culprit seems to be my new usb CF reader.  Unfortunately it's unbranded
and I can't identify the underlying hardware.  None of the specific drivers
(e.g. sandisk, lexar, microtech, freecom) need to be loaded for it to work,
so I guess there's some generic protocol for usb->scsi?
Regardless, unless someone else has an idea, I'm going to try manually
merging the usb-storage changes in from 2.4.17 to 2.4.18-rc2 until it
breaks to try and isolate the problem..
