Hello,
So, i have compiled 2.4.24-pre2 as you say. In addition, i had this Oops
after every reboot on 2.4.23 (nothing with 2.4.18 which works fine).
Then, I reboot again on 2.4.24-pre2 and ran `burnP5` during 40 minutes
to be sure. I had nothing and no oops at the moment. If i see this Oops
with 2.4.24 (nothing now ;)), i'll run burnP5 on this and i'll say you
what i have.
Thanks for your help...
++ Arnaud
