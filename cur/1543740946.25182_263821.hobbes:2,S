I have been using the lufs module in combination with autofs to be able 
to automount ftp sites on the fly.  But, if lufs is broken due to the 
lack of the "kill_proc_info" symbol being available, perhaps I will just 
remove lufs and find another way (or wait until there is some kind of 
patch for lufs).
