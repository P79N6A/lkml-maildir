In lists.linux.kernel you write:

You'll need a modeline which matches your current video mode (try fbset -x).
Then configure X11 like this:
Section "Screen"
        Driver          "FBDev"
        Device          "matrox"
        Monitor         "gateway"
        SubSection      "Display"
                Modes   "1024x768"
                Virtual 1024 768
        EndSubSection
EndSection
