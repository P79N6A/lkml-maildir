I get lots of errors like these:
kernel: PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
kernel: hdh: drive not ready for command
kernel: ide3: reset: success
kernel: hdf: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
kernel: hdf: drive not ready for command
kernel: hdh: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
kernel: hdh: drive not ready for command
kernel: hdh: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
kernel: PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
kernel: hdh: drive not ready for command
kernel: ide3: reset: success
* Running virtually every kernel since 2.4.17-2.4-21-x.
* All harddrives UDMA100.
* Tried with DMA and unmask IRQ off.
* Tried with and without ACPI, APIC and APM.
* Happens to all harddrives.
* Cabling,  power,  hardware  and drives thorowly checked and replaced
  for testing.
* Tested with one VIA KT266a motherboard and two Intel 440BX
* SMART values good.
* To all my testing I have not found any problems with the hardware.
* When to many of these IDE error occur the system freezes.
* Errors occur with the internal controller as well as the two Promise
  PDC20268 (U100 Tx2) controllers.
What  should  I do to fix this? I do not want to run Windows as I need
LVM to manage the diskspace. Windows does however run very stable.
Any tips or ideas are welcome!
Regards,
Anders
