Good rule of thumb: If you run into swap, add RAM. Swap is /extremely/ slow
memory, however fast you make it go. RAM is not expensive anymore...

Right. But your average task is far from that size, and most of it resides
in shared libraries and (perhaps shared) executables, and is perhaps even
COW shared with other tasks.

But you really never do. That is the point.
