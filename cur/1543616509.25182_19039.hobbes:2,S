Absolutely, no argument from me there.

If every combination for a given cpuid translates to the same CONFIG_
option, fine. I'm just not sure from memory if thats the case or not.
The various Celeron/PIII's for example, some have SSE, some don't.
Assuming Intel cpuid xxx translates to CONFIG_PENTIUMIII would break if
thats the case.
