There is no formal list that I know of. You can look at
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S for the names and numbers of syscalls, but
for the parameters you would have to grep around for the system call
definition. 
For the syscalltrack project we have a close to complete of syscalls
and their parameters for 2.4, i386, at
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
*checkout*/syscalltrack/syscalltrack/module/syscalls.dat?rev=1.18
Note that such a list is of limited useful utility unless it is tied
to a specific kernel version, since the kernel gains new syscalls
occasionally. Patches to update the list to 2.5 will be happily
accepted ;-)
Cheers, 
Muli
