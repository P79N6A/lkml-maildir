Not sure how much difference it will make performance-wise, but the context
switch for each bio adds some extra cost at least. Changing it
means you no longer share the ps3stor_read_write_sectors, but can at
the same time simplify the disk driver, so that won't hurt in total.
I don't care much, but I think it's worth trying.
