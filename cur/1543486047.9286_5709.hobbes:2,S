Well, if the file name was originally passed to you from user space, you
should be able to pass it to namei / lnamei / __namei without problems, as
this will pull it into kernel space.
If for some reason you bring the filename into kernel space yourself, and
'fiddle' with it (or are generating the pathname by hand?), either
i) use dentry stuff if you're getting parent directories, etc.;
ii) call lookup_dentry yourself (look at namei() source to see how it does it).
It might help if we knew what you were trying to achieve :) Are you writing
a new syscall or modifying an existing one? What's your code (trying to) do?
Cheers,
Steve
