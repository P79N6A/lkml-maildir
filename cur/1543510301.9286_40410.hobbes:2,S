Hi,
	I had an oops with 2.0.37 and it seems to be in 2.0.38 as I had a
non-fatal (the machine didn't lock) kernel oops today within 3 days of
upgrading.
I looked at ksymoops but I dont' know what file I'm supposed to feed it on
stdin. 
From the oops:
EIP: 0010:[<0015609d>]
Call Trace: [<00155f48>] [<00112d39>] [<001186b3>]  etc
Looking at System.map
001560e4 T ip_autofw_expire
00155f48 t masq_expire
00112a4c t timer_bh
00112d80 T do_timer
00118678 T do_bottom_half
001186d8 T get_ioport_list
Is this the info you need? If not email me directly and I'll get send more
info.
