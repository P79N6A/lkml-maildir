What happens is that the value assigned to AFLAGS_vmlinux.lds.o is lost
between the first and the second invocation of make in arch/i386/kernel
The only difference is the setting of LANG etc. - which you deleted
from the log.
Pleae try to delete the following lines from the top-level Makefile and try again:
line 622-626:
	$(Q)if [ ! -z $$LC_ALL ]; then          \
	export LANG=$$LC_ALL;           \
	export LC_ALL= ;                \
	fi;                                     \
	export LC_COLLATE=C; export LC_CTYPE=C; \
If this cures the problem then please provide me with you LANG settings.
Both LANG and LC_* variables.
If it still fails please provide me with the _full_ unedited log up until
the point where it fails.
Since I have to reports on this issue I really would like to have it
nailed before 2.6.8 is out.
The other report is from: Pawe? Sikora <pluto@pld-linux.org>
