The short answer is "feel free to do what you like, but Linus will
keep on distributing full tarballs".
Linus doesn't mind if you have a mirror of ftp.kernel.org, and then
split it and put that on your own FTP site. If more people start use
that than use the original ftp.kernel.org, then that might be an
important argument to Linus to start running your script.
