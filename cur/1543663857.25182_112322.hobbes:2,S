Hi ,
Please advice me how to use kdb .. Also let me know how to use the 
same
to debug modules inserted by me using "insmod".
Please get me a pointer to some useful links which discuss about 
the usage of kdb to debug kernel source as well as modules 
inserted using insmod.
Am facing a dump when i try invoking my own system call which has 
been registered in the module inserted by me.
Thanks in advance,
Sudharsan.
