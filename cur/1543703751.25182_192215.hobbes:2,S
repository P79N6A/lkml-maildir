Ok, you mean copying the memory pages back down ? That should be done
with hand-made assembly or C code located specifically elsewhere then.
I do not want to see any kind of this ugly C-generated assembly in
arch/ppc.

I think that's a wrong assumption. I see personally _NO_ reason to
assume the boot and restored kernel are the same. They absolutely
don't need to do at all.

Still... That makes assumptions about how it's located and organised
that plain wrong (c). Please get rid of that, at least I won't let a PPC
version do that. Depending on how much time I can spare, I'll try to
work on that PPC port later this week. If you need something like clock
calibration data down to the loaded kernel, then either re-calculate it
in the wakeup code path, or pass it via some _sane_ interface (at
_least_ a versioned data structure, better, a tagged list of values like
some bootloaders do).

device_suspend is, imho, hairy too. We have some semantics that need
cleanup here, I'll have to talk to Patrick about them. Putting devices
to an idle state is what you need and what kexec need, and doesn't mean
putting them to _sleep_. Or maybe we could pass a specific state to
device_suspend for that. For example, it makes little sense to spin down
the hard disk at this stage, or to power off the video chip...
