DR6 isn't cleared.  Here is a nice security exploit for you:
	- Task A sets DR0 and DR7 to enable a watchpoint (or breakpoint).
	- It also clears DR6.
	- Task A wakes up task B, which has DR7 clear.
	- Task A then communicates with "sshd" or some other sensitive task.
	- Because of lazy DR7 clearing, sshd inherits the watchpoints.
	- If sshd reads the memory address mentioned in DR0, it will
	  call do_debug in the kernel, which clears DR7 and continues.
	- However, DR6 bit B0 is now set.
	- Eventually task B is scheduled.  It inherits the value of DR6
	  from sshd, and therefore knows if sshd read from a particular
	  memory location.
	- Task A and task B cooperate to analyse what values sshd is
	  examining in its lookup tables, and therefore retrieve the
	  server key or something.  (Hand waving at this point).
