Are we sure that there are no users that depend on accessing the different 
fields under different locks?
Having them as separate "int" fields means that they don't have any 
interaction, and normal cache coherency will "just work". Once they are 
fields in the same word in memory, updating one field automatically will 
do a read-write cycle on the other fields, and if _they_ are updated by 
interrupts or other CPU's at the same time, a write can get lost..
So I'd like this to be ack'ed by Ingo.
Ingo?
