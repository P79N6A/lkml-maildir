I've got an UP2000 board from Samsung for two Alpha21264 CPUs.
When I selected dp264 from the general section of xconfig, booting
stops with the following error message:
dp264_device_interrupt: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!!
Calibrating delay loop ...
I was able to compile a working SMP kernel from 2.2.15pre14 by switching 
back to "generic",  from "dp264".  Please take a note.
Thank you very much.
