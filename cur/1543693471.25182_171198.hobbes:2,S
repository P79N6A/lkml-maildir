Well, I may misunderstand the measurement here. By previous comment from
Matthew Wilcox, I see "Clearly it's too late to change the ioctl
definitions...". Er, so all things like IOR_BAD and size_t are just to
keep current API untouched, while warning subsequent guys right way to
populate ioctls. :) Then the last question is: is it worthy of some
efforts to modify these APIs completely? Maybe the bee just bites
once...
