Dear,
Please bear with me for sending this letter to you surprisingly. My
name is Mr SIMON JEBBA, a young man originally from SIERRA LEONE in west 
Africa.My sole purpose of contacting you is that i have a significant quantity of Gold which i will like you to help me in moving it out of the this nation to your possession prior to my arrival.
The Gold is currently deposited in one of the Security vault over here in Dakar republic of Senegal and it is waiting for my order to be transfered as I am the "NEXT OF KIN" to
the deposit, as it is indicated in all the depositional documents.I am
presently living in dakar senegal  
  i  will give to you 20per of the total amount involved if you should help me 
to sale these stones or get any body that will buy them.Or help me to move them 
to a place where they could be sold.
I do not have any business experience, and i am looking forward to your
professional business advice
You can contact me at simonjebba@tiscali.co.uk, and,  
simonjebba@yahoo.com
thank you and God bless
SIMON JEBBA
