Yes.
And sorry, but I don't have any other USB2.0 device to test.
I try with my cel phone (Motorola V3i) in this night (GMT-3).

In my dmesg today, I see this:
usb 1-1: can't set config #1, error -71
When I remove and input (again) my Mouse, I see this in /var/log/messages:
kernel: usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 3
kernel: usb 1-1: new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
kernel: usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
kernel: input: Microsoft Microsoft 3-Button Mouse with IntelliEye? as 
/class/input/input8
kernel: input: USB HID v1.00 Mouse [Microsoft Microsoft 3-Button Mouse 
with IntelliEye?] on usb-0000:00:1d.0-1
