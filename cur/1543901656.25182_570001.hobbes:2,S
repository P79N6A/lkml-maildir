Subject: Re: [V9fs-developer] [GIT PULL] 9p Patches for 2.6.23 merge window
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/16/283

The original patchset had three patches:
1. Renames all functions and macros
2. Moves the header files from fs/9p to include/net/9p and updates the
C files with the new header locations
3. Moves the C files from fs/9p to net/9p
Unfortunately the three patches were applied as a single one in Eric's
repository and made tracking of the changes harder. We will be more
careful next time.
Thanks for you comments,
