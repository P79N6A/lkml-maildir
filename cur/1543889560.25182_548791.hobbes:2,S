I think we should remove these kmalloc(0, ...) warnings prior to
the 2.6.22 release, put them back afterwards.
Actually it would be useful to have some config variable which is "false"
for production kernels (2.6.x, 2.6.x.y) and "true" for development kernels
(2.6.x-rcN).  I suspect we'd end up using this in quite a lot of places for
general developer-nags which shouldn't be exposed to users of production
kernels.
The problem with this is that on the day Linus goes from 2.6.x-rc7 to 2.6.x
we suddenly get a compile-time kernel which nobody has tested, so we'd need
to set CONFIG_DEVELOPMENT_KERNEL to false around the -rc4/5 timeframe.
I'm not sure how we could do this, apart from patching and unpatching a
config file each time.
