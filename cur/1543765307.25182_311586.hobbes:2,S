I know, this is why I referenced the other LKML threads. What keeps these 
functions from being propagated to the other archs? Are there still 
unresolved issues? (x86 not marking RAM pages reserved would be one I 
assume)?

So the fact that remap_pfn_range() does not work on pages allocated with 
__get_free_pages() is an x86-only issue? Or is it by design?
