The current PCMCIA drivers don't initialize all fields necessary for the
ibmtr.c driver. 
I created a patch which is in the PCMCIA beta list on 
http://hyper.stanford.edu/HyperNews/get/pcmcia/beta.html.
With this patch, the driver opens the ring OK and receives frames.
However, for me it still crashes big on sending frames (i.e. it reboots
the Thinkpad without any oops or similar).
Unfortunately, i don't have any hardware manuals for the IBM PCMCIA card
to check what might go wrong...
Cheers,
Jochen
