egcs doesn't generate thread-safe exceptions, despite what the doctors
say. At least not a recent (one month old?) version I got from the egcs
project page. There actually appear to be all sorts of thread-safety
problems. In a simple app, I experienced heap and stack corruption
(often happening deep in the bowels of the first pthread_create call).
Dubious, am I, young Skywalker. Highly dubious.

Agreed and agreed, IMO...and I think that this is largely what this is
about. At least before the witch-burners and the demon-worshippers all
turned up at the same cab-rank.
