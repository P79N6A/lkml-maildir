ls can't access the files either, so I don't see how that could rectify 
anything.  The entire directory becomes inaccessible.   This happened to 
/lib once.  Nasty.
I'd like to be able to use something like reiserfs, especially when 
developing (it reduces boot time a lot).  However to call it 'stable' on 
2.4.4 is simply wrong.  If/when the nfs fix gets merged and tested 
*then* it stands a chance of being called stable.
