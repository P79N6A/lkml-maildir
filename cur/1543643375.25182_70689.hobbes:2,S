not sure i understand what you're proposing, but while we're at it, why
not also make the api for apps to allocate a buffer in userland that (for
nics that support it) the nic can dma directly into?  it seems likely
notification that the buffer was used would have to travel through the
kernel, but it would be nice to save the interrupts altogether.
this may be exactly what you were saying.

totally agreed.  this is a must for high-performance computing now (since 
who wants to waste 80-100% of their CPU just running the network)?
