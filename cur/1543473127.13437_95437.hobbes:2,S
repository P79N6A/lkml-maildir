Nobody is "getting mad". RMS has an opinion ; albeit a pretty damn
strong opinion (and he is in a position where his opinions get a lot of
attention and discussion). However, I doubt that he'd strike back at the

Why don't you read, and then reread the exact clause that you so kindly
attached in this ridiculous scenario. A new "nightmare" GPL version
would not affect any programs currently licensed under the GPL.
