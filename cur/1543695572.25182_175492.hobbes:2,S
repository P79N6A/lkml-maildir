CPR -- checkpoint/restart
POSIX said to use SIGCKPT and SIGCONT (in at least *one* of the draft
1003.1m standards -- I've lost access to them recently, and the
working group stopped working back in 2000)
Suspend/resume is essentially a system-wide checkpoint+restart.
Maybe use SIGCKPT and SIGCONT?  Or even SIGSTOP and SIGCONT (after
all, you're stopping the process, then restarting it)
