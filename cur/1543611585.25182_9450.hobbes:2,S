Of course the drive is longer attached to HPT370 and your friend is propably
reluctant to reattach it, but it would still be nice to know if he gets
consistent results which for example this simple test:
  cat /dev/hde | mdsum
run for several (5-10, perhaps) times.
OTOH, I haven't had corruption with reading only 
one disk at a time, but then again I haven't tried too hard as they 
should really work in parallel.
