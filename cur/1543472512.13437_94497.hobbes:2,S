It wouldn't surprise me to see more of this occur.  Especially when you 
have propietary hardware manufacturers that write the drivers and interfaces
for their hardware when want to interface with Linux, and not release
openly the source to what they perceive as a major source of their income.  
Granted it will more likely happen with more specialized, high end hardware, 
unless it is the case where it is just too easy to install and use, to not 
buy, as with OSS.
