The big problem is though that we don't typically find out that
we've regressed until after a kernel update is in the end-users hands.
In many cases, submitters of changes know that things are going
to break. Maybe we need a policy that says changes requiring userspace updates
need to be clearly documented in the mails Linus gets (Especially if its
a git pull request), so that when the next point release gets released,
Linus can put a section in the announcement detailing what bits
of userspace are needed to be updated.
It still isn't to solve the problem of regressions in drivers, but
that's a problem that's not easily solvable.
