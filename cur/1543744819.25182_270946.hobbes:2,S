Hello all,
I have ported Vyacheslav Zavadsky's work with trustees 
(
http://trustees.sourceforge.net
) to the Linux security module API.
Trustees is an advanced Linux permission system inspired by Netware. It 
allows a system administrator to attach "trustees" to any directory or 
file. All subdirectories and files in that directory will also inherit 
these trustees. Trustee rights can be overridden, denied or added to in 
subsequent directories.
In short, it is a recursive directory-based replacement for POSIX acls. 
   All permissions are managed from a central file and thus allows even 
filesystems (network, vfat, etc.) without extended attribute support to 
have an advanced permission scheme. It should compile against any 
version of the 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_SECURITY enabled (it currently 
compiles as just an external module).
Please see my website for more information:

I have been using it for a couple weeks with no problems, but your 
mileage may vary.  The code still needs some cleanups, and I need to 
figure out how to do some benchmarking on the performance hit, but I 
would very much so appreciate feedback, bug-reports, etc.
Thanks and I am not on the list so please Cc any replies,
Andrew Ruder
