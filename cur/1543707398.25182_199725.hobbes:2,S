On 2.4.23 kernel, keventd is not using much CPU time, but on 2.4.25-pre8 
keventd is taking upto same amount as X. The difference is atleast a 
decade or two. The configurations of these kernels are the same.
On 2.6.3 kernel, events/0 is taking CPU time, much like keventd in 
2.4.25-pre8.
I'm using vanilla kernels from kernel.org on HP Omnibook 4150, PIII 500, 
with BX chipset. 256MB memory, 3c589_cs.
I'm happy to provide any additional information and do some testing, 
if needed. Remember to put me on cc-list, I'm not subscribed.
TIA,
