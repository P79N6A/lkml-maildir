SSH and 3 RPC-based services, I would guess.  This is not a kernel
bug, there are probably userspace applications which are opening
those ports, even something as simple as an FTP client in active
mode would do it.  Please run "netstat -lp" to determine which
processes have opened each port.

nmap doesn't scan higher-numbered ports by default, because those
ports are generally allocated dynamically by the kernel when user
programs indicate they do not care what port they are bound on.
