I am just a user. I have no idea of what you are talking.
All I do is use "X" (xorg-x11, version 6.8.1). kernel compiled
without framebuffer support. Well it was. I got rid of kernel 2.6.9.
Back to kernel 2.6.7. Dialup. Another two hours to download 2.6.9
again. Another few hours to recompile and test the kernel.
I am no programmer. What is drm? How does the i810 driver in
xorg work? I have no idea.

An HP 7850 - various motherboards used ... this one has an
e-machine motherboard. Bios has no controls for the video
chip. Does FW82810E sound line the chipset? It is mentioned
somewhere in the motherboard doc I found on some site (not HP's
so it may or may not be correct).
