Nothing except for a SETI process and all the usual daemons. I was
also in X11 (3.3.6). 
I think this is probably related to the problems I've had in the past
with buffer corruption (which is still happening despite my efforts to
locate the fault - changed memory chips, changed power supply units to
no avail). Now I just put up with it and reboot. 
Cheers,
Alex.
