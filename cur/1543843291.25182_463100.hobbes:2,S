That's not true at all.  The program I posted earlier in this thread 
uses set_thread_area() to allocate a GDT slot, and it works on both 
native 32 bit and 32-under-64.  The entry_number field in the struct 
user_desc is an actual entry number, so you can easily construct a 
selector from it.

Er, that all looks completely unnecessary.
