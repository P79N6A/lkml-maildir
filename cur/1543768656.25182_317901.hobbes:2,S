I just caught this thread in the corner of my eye.
I'm seeing the BUG assert in kernel/timers.c:cascade()
kick in (tmp->base is somehow 0) during a test which
creates a few tasks of priority higher than ksoftirqd.
This race doesn't happen if ksoftirqd's priority is
elevated (eg: chrt -f -p 75 2) so the -RT patch might
be opening up a window here.
I'm in the process of investigating this and see a few
potential suspects but was wondering if anyone else has
seen this behavior?
