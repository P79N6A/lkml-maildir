Well, I went through all tty related patches that went in after 2.6.21
and didn't really find anything interesting, except this:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=543691a6cd70b606dd9bed5e77b120c5d9c5c506
But it does seem correct. You could try reverting that from 2.6.22-rc3
and see if you can trigger the bug.
Looking at the original report again:
> release_dev: driver.table[3] not tty for (tty4)
So tty from filp->private_data does not match
tty->driver->ttys[tty->index] and release_dev bails out (thus messing
up reference count).

Presumably someone tries to close the file again which is why we get a
new complaint that reference counting has gone bad.
Unfortunately, I have no idea why drivers->tty does not match. It
could be a race with release_tty() or real use-after-free but I am
unable to find anything obvious in 2.6.21 -> 2.6.22-rc3 that would
break it. Doing the git bisect dance here would really help...
