I use cscope instead, and vim's front-end to it.
(Emacs fans: XEmacs has a similar support, see cscope page on sourceforge).
Much more powerful than plain tags,
because it allows also things like 
"where are all the calls to this function",
but you still can jump about with ^T/^]
At top level of the kernel source tree (/usr/src/linux) do
find . -name '*.[hc]' -print > cscope.files
cscope -b -k -I/usr/src/linux/include
In the .vimrc used for kernel editing, do:
cscope add /usr/src/linux/cscope.out /usr/src/linux
set cstag
And do :help cscope to see what this thing is about...
Or, for a quick start, just do :cs
See also cscope on sourceforge.
