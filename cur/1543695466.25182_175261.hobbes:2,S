How does uSDE relate to udev? You do not mention it in your email, though 
it claims to implement similar, if not identical functionality. Is it 
related? Is it built on top of it? 
If not, are you planning on merging your efforts with udev in the future? 
Are you using the libsysfs library for accessing sysfs data? If not, I 
highly recommend it. 
I would also recommend sending email to the linux-hotplug list, as most of 
the hotplug-related applications are discussed and developed via that 
list.
