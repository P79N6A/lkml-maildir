That is only when they really don't understand the consequences.
I run systems both with vswap at 0, where I don't want any failures - disk
servers, and at infinity - single user workstations where it doesn't matter,
AND at something in between where I can (or am directed to) tolerate an
ocasional failure.
The vswap operation was put back right after IRIX implemented an uncontroled
overcommitment of memory resources. It took an entire version of IRIX to
get it to work right, but as of now, it is very usefull. SGI lost several
customers during the interim, but I think they started getting them back
after the controls were working (we dropped a power challenge array after
about a year and a half due to various problems that could have been caused by
poor resource control).
