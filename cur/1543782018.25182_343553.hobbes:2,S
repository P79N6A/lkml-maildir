Subject: suspicious behaviour in pcwd driver.

drivers/char/watchdog/pcwd.c does this if it detects
a temperature out of range..
            if (temp_panic) {
                printk (KERN_INFO PFX "Temperature overheat trip!\n");
                machine_power_off();
            }
Two problems here are..
1. machine_power_off() isn't exported on ppc64. (patch below)
2. that printk will never hit the logs, so the admin will just find
a powered off box with no idea what happened.
Should we at least sync block devices before doing the power off ?

Export machine_power_off() on ppc64, as the pcwd watchdog driver needs it.
