What kind of patents would IBM like to bind to the source code? It seems
to me that IBM is trying to do something that contradicts the very
essence of GPL as GPL is set out to make sure the object of the licence
stays free, usable and available for everyone while patents are set out
to make sure that the availability (but most of all usability) of the
object of the patent stays limited to a selected few.
