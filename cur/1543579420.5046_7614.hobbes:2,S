There's no no-no here: you can even create the "struct page"s on demand,
and create a dummy local zone that contains them that they all point back
to. It should be trivial - nobody else cares about those pages or that
zone anyway.
This is very much how the MM layer in 2.4.x is set up to work.
That said, nobody has actually done this in practice yet, so there may be
details to work out, of course. I don't see any fundamental reasons it
wouldn't easily work, but..
