... but this time around that's nothing major--mostly just small
bugfixes and cleanup, including 64 bit inode support from Peter Staubach
and some preparation for supporting callbacks (hence delegations) over
krb5.
One outstanding question is what to do about the server RDMA and
transport-switch code, not yet included below.  It would nice to finally
see that start going in, but it's a lot of code to add this late.
