Yes, right now the shmem writepage calls are the only ones returning one at
all.  But, the question of how to properly fsync/msync these kinds of pages
still stands.  Returning from an fsync before writing them isn't correct.
Either way, filemap_fdatasync needs fixing, since it drops the dirty bit on
these pages.  They'll never get written after going through it.
