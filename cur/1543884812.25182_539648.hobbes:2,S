I've seen that too often already, now we could point to a mail someone
sent to Uwe regarding maintainership.
You wouldn't be better at the moment, Mauro at least aknowlidges the
work of others.
I don't know what problems you have with Mauro I heard that there have
been some mails between you and some other developers as well and the
whole situation is just terrible.
If you want to change the whole situation, think about what you can do
for improving the whole situation even if it means that you have to
work with people you don't like.

I wrote what I'd like to see from you, it would be a start if you
could work on that first.
