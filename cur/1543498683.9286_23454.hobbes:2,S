Hi all,
I have a mail spool drive w/ corrupted super-block
and don't know how to recovery the data. 
During e2fsck on the /dev/sdc1 , it said "bad magic
number in super-block"
I made a mirror drive "dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb"
and after I "mke2fs -S /dev/sdb1; e2fsck -y /dev/sdb1"
I can mount the drive and see the content.
However after reboot, the drive (/dev/sdb1) goes back
to "bad magic number in super-block" and after that,
I do "dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb" again, and then
do mke2fs -S and e2fsck the partition again. But this
time, I got lots of
"Group xxx's inode bitmap (xxxx) is bad. Relocate? yes"
and after seeing "Bad block 0 used as bad block indirect
block?!?", it loops back to beginning ... and I can never
make it work again.
Tried "e2fsck -b <8192*[1-20]+1> /dev/sdb1" and same "bad
magic number " error.
Any idea on how to recovery the drive? Is there any tools
available to do this?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Tom
