This patch series adds a new "thermal" subsystem and is rightly placed
under drivers/thermal/ . intel_menlow.c isn't fully a thermal driver. It
does all the platform specific stuff (thermal is one of them). It's not
fitting under any of the subsystems hence moved to drivers/misc

There is nothing wrong in giving 2 MODULE_AUTHORS. Both will be
displayed in the command modinfo -F author.
