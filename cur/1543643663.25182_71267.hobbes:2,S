...which might explain why my machine has occasional DRM related hangs,
since there is no way for me to match the XFree86 AGP speed and the BIOS
set AGP speed -- my BIOS will not tell me what it set, nor does it have
a toggle to adjust it.
Does some tool already exist that can query this information from
userspace? If not, are the specifications needed to build one freely
available?
