Customer: "This system could not find the root fs."
Support: "Oh, yeah, just connect a (USB-) keyboard and scroll back."
Hmm, device detection works after panic?
I really like the "soft" panic better, where you still can operate the 
kernel debugging features, but just have no user space supporting it.
One better hopes, that keyboards never need external firmware to be loaded
at this stage :-)
