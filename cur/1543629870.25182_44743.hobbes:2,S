Hi Guennadi,
Like so many other good ideas, this feature support is not already there
simply because nobody has submitted a patch for it, yet. (and
followed-up/lobbied with sufficient tenacity and grace) 
Also, be aware that there is in progress a rewrite of the serial driver
subsystem for 2.5. See Russell King's entry in the maintainers list. 
I'm only on the 2.4 side, but I would like to see a tested patch against
either 2.5 or 2.4 for fixup of 16850 support. Since you have the 16850
hardware (and I don't), please consider creating a patch to serial.c and
friends that adds this feature support and posting it for discussion to 
linux-serial@vger.kernel.org. Put enough comments at the top so anyone with
the datasheet can understand your intent. 
Thanks,
Ed
