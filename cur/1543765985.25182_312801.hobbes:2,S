Likely because its a chroot vulnerability.
It allows a process to obtain a reference to the root vfsmount that
doesn't have chroot checks performed on it.
Consider the following pseudo example:
main():
chdir("/");
fd = open(".", O_RDONLY);
clone(cloned_func, cloned_stack, CLONE_NEWNS, NULL);
cloned_func:
fchdir(fd);
chdir("..");
if main is run within a chroot where it's "/" is on the same vfsmount as
 it's "..", then the application can step out of the chroot using clone(2).
Note: using chdir in a vfsmount outside of your namespace works, however
you won't be able to walk off that vfsmount (to its parent or children).
