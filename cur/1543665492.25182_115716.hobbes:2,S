And  on a 10K scsi disk I'm running 35s per 10,000 directories, which is way, 
way slower than it ought to be.  There are two analysis tools we're hurting 
for badly here:
   - We need to see the physical allocation maps for directories, preferably
     in a running kernel.  I think the best way to do this is a little 
     map-dumper hooked into ext3/dir.c and exported through /proc.
  - We need block-access traces in a nicer form than printks (or nobody
    will ever use them).  IOW, we need LTT or something very much like
    it.

Yes, I think that's exactly what's happening.  There are some questions 
remaining, such as why doesn't it happen to akpm.  Another question: why does 
it happen to the directory creates, where the only thing being accessed 
randomly is the directory itself - the inode table is supposedly being 
allocated/dirtied sequentially.
