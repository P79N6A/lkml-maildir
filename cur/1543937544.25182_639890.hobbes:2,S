for now i applied your ioremap_uncached() patch and removed my patch.
my patch might work if the MTRR marks that area UC. Does it on your 
system?
if the MTRRs (as set up by the BIOS) keep it at WB, then the ACPI 
ioremap() is already unsafe: the mmio area that happens to be there 
might be prefetched by the CPU.
