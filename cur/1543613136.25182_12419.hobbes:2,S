cyclades does request_region(), but forgets to do release_region().
This will leave the region allocated in kernel data structures,
but its "name" field resides in module memory.
So if you load cyclades.o, then rmmod it, then cat /proc/ioports,
you'll touch unmapped memory and go boom.
Some brave soul needs to teach cyclades about release_region().
Shame the Nobel prizes are all gone this year.
