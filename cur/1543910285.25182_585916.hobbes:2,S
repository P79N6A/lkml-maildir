(Sorry for butting in), but I wonder if relying on that in code here
(granted, a PS3-only driver, but it's in drivers/ and not arch/) would
be good style. Why not just print it out as: "%llu" and use an (unsigned
long long) cast, considering that's the largest type sector_t can ever
have (irrespective of arch) ... I can see most of the other generic places
in the kernel (such as in drivers/md/) also using the latter (%llu with
unsigned long long cast) to get bi_sector printed.
