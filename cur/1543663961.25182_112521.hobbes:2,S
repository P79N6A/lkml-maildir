Sorry, should have been more specific. I am referring to the scheduler. 
I have noticed
that if I run two compute intensive jobs on a Dual Xeon, the processes 
run on separate
physical cpus and can spend a significant amount of time with both on a 
single
cpu. I have seen some patches that try to improve on this and was 
wondering if
they have made it into the production kernel stream. I ran tests on a 
2.4.20 kernel and
it had the same problem as a 2.4.18 kernel.
                                    Thanks
                                     Mike
