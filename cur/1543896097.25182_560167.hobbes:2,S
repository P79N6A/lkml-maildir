    I guess it's been based on the prior work by John Stultz (and me too :-)?

    If you mean the init. part, this has been already done by me -- I've 
implemented read_persistent_clock() and got rid of xtime setting. What's left 
is to implemet update_persistent_clock() and get rid of timer_check_rtc()...

    Perhaps we even need to raise the rating to 300 or 400 -- according to 
what <linux/clocksource.h> says?

    PPC64 has issues with the fixed shift value, see:

    I don't quite understand why not just init them right away?  The values 
are fixed anyways.

    I.e. in the softirq context...
