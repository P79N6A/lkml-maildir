Ok, so how about this diff.
I'm actually feeling good about this one. It really looks like 
"do_no_page()" was simply buggy, and that this explains everything.
Please please please test. Throw all the other patches away (with the 
possible exception of the "update_mmu_cache()" sanity checker, which is 
still interesting in case some _other_ place does this too).
Don't do the "wait_on_page_writeback()" thing, because it changes timings 
and might hide thngs for the wrong reasons.  Just apply this on top of a 
known failing kernel, and test.
