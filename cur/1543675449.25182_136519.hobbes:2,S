Easy of viewing should be considered. We have tried to show a high level 
summary that allows the users to quickly, looking in one place, 
determine if any significant data is found. When the users seems 
something of interest, they only need follow the links to see the 
details. Its shouldn't be necessary for users to sift through one email 
for each test. If finding signficant data was easier, and I think it can 
be made easier, users would look at it themselves and there wouldn't be 
the need to have to notify l-k.
I'm not trying to be competetive here. I just think results and 
comparisons can be made that covers a large amount of tests in a single 
page or note. One note per day does not IMHO seem like too much. That 
note can always be the "tip of the iceberg" pointing to many other 
things. Thus those not interested can simply skip that note.
