In the meantime, I notice that Alan has put an incompatible version of the
mtrr patch into 6-ac1.  What are the differences between these two
implementations of mtrrs for AMD processors, and is a merged version in the
works?  The -ac1 version doesn't seem to work at all on my machine,
/proc/mtrr exists but doesn't change when I "echo" to it.
By the way, I've missed the discussions, AMD seems to offer just two MTRRs.
But I'd like to set up at least 3 distinct regions (main memory, 2d
framebuffer, and voodoo2 memory).  I suppose I just give up and do only
main memory and 2d framebuffer.  Should I do something complicated like
changing the second mtrr to the voodoo2 card when a mesa app starts up, and
restoring it when it ends?
