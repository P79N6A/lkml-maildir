I haven't been following this thread, so I don't know if this is relevant:
do you have the *very latest* hotplug scripts?  The previous ones tested
the kernel version against "2.5", while the latest test against that and also
"2.6".  I think this was in the usb script.  Without the "2.6" test device
scripts are not run, at least for usb devices.
Ciao,
Duncan.
