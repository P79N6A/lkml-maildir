This is a Linux kernel development list, stop spamming it. So far I have
been told you aren't paying speakers expenses, told you actually were once
the thing hit the Linux media, been listed as speaking in a program that 
seems to have been published after I announced I was not attending, and
now you are spamming the linux mailing lists.
Is LinuxWorld determined to have the entire Linux world boycott it ?
