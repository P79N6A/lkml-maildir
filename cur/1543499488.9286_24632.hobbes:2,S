I disagree with the claim that it requires a pile of new kernel files. 
It basically means you have started in the wrong end of the problem. 
There is a need for Linux do develop a decent device driver management;
unfortunately devfs is a hack to patch it rather than tacking the
admittedly hard problem.

I don't necessarily think it's a good idea, but unlike devfs it isn't an
all-pervasive thing and wouldn't be running on most -- if any --
systems.  Consequently I don't particularly care one way or the other; I
can imagine a very small set of machines for which it could make sense.
Similarly, I don't care if Richard Gooch runs devfs on his machine. 
However, for devfs to make sense, it has to be everywhere, and I do
object to *that*.
