Heh.. well all the power to them.  Still no reason for an open source

Same comment.   Someone should create a distribution dedicated to this
market if it's that important.

If enough people are interested in it, it can't be that hard to organize
external maintenance of the patch.  Even these long conversations on the
mailing list show why the bloody thing should be ejected already.  Move it
to it's own tree with it's own mailing list etc..

I agree with you that it should taint at a minimum.   But should something
that taints the kernel even be part of the mainline source?
