I'd have to agree.  I wrote a script that sits here mounting a samba mount, then, either writing to it, and unmount, write to it and no,unmount, just unmount it, or nothing, pseudo randomly, and it pissed off my windows machine it was connecting to, but could NOT reproduce this problem.  I can't seem to get it to happen again though.  I'm sort of at a loss.  I can provide any extra info that might help.
