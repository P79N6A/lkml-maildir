Will do this tomorrow. Please note that md1 is only used on the 
unmounted /boot filesystem. mount says:
turbotaz linux # mount
/dev/md/1 on / type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,nosuid)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
shm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw,devmode=0664,devgid=85)
/dev/md/1 is raid10.
Cheers,
Chase
