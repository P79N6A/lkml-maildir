Without -ffreestanding, the compiler is completely free to decide 
whether to use a builtin or whether to not use it - and which other C 
library functions to use.
Your commit 6edfba1b33c701108717f4e036320fc39abe1912 that claimed
"it was only added for x86-64, so dropping it should be safe" was not 
safe, it had broken at least mips and m68k. This wrong justification 
alone should warrant a revert of this commit.
What's the problem with adding -ffreestanding and stating explicitely 
which functions we want to be handled be builtins, and which functions 
we don't want to be handled by builtins?
This looks like the right way to go instead of breaking other 
architectures here and there.
