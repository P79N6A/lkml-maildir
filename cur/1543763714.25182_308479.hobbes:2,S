Fixing the "sparse -Wbitwise" messages, and addressing some other
behavior changes/bugs that crept in, was the idea.  That's already
done, but _without_ taking this as a basis (or breaking the sysfs
support etc).
The patches I sent fix everything I had time to test (just a subset
of the dozens of cases previously tested, probably covering the main
stuff that got broken) except the non-PCI platform_bus drivers where
pm_message_t has discarded essential functionality.  (Notably, info
about whether device clocks and/or power must be turned off.)
Fixing those will be more work than seems reasonable for 2.6.12
kernels.  Among other things, there's still a lot of stuff that
needs to percolate out to arch trees; designing and testing such
fixes takes time, as does percolating it back.

p.s. PCI-express patches don't belong with USB patches.  :)
