I agree with your modification, and with the obvious 4
points above ...

... but I fail to see this one. If we get a low cache hit
rate, couldn't that just mean we allocated too little memory
for the cache ?
I am very much interested in continuing this discussion...
Also, how would we translate all these requirements into
VM strategies ?
