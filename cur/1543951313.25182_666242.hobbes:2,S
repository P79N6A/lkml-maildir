Alex pointed out that IBM interprets the spec the same way that HP does.
Are there any other machines that follow the spec the same way that
Fujitsu does?

I hadn't realised that patch got in to put the bus name in as a
uniquifier.  I thought we'd rejected it because the problem only
occurred on one box with bad firmware.

this revision of the patch -- maybe Alex dropped that part?
