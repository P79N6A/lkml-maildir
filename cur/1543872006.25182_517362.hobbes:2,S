If you're willing, please add
Signed-off-by: Nigel Cunningham <ncunning@redhat.com>
or
Acked-by: Nigel Cunningham <ncunning@redhat.com>
to the hibernation related parts as you see appropriate, since I helped
(albeit in a minor way compared to your work and Eric's work) with
preparing and testing them for RHEL5 and have confirmed they're still ok
in this version.
Regards,
Nigel
