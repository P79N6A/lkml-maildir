| Alternatively, deal with this problem the same way the "This may also be
| built as a module..." comment is - either include it several thousand
| times in Configure.help or (better still) have the configuration tools

| and `make menuconfig` parsers, and should be just as easy in CML2.
| Applying rule (1) will result in a considerable reduction in the size of
| the file Documentation/Configure.help as it currently stands.

I like this!
