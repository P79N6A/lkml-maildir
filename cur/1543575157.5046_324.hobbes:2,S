I am not a subscriber to this list, but I thought this was important
information (which you might already have).
The cyrixIII chips by via have the centaur vendor id which causes the
identify_cpu call in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c to fail.  It is probably
reasonable for it to have the centaur id as via owns centaur as well.  I
just replaced the centaur_model call with the cyrix_model one, but I
know that I am using a cyrix chip.
A test probably needs to be added in the centaur_model section to test
for the cyrixIII in disguise.
The error is a general protection fault.
Sorry if this is old hat,
