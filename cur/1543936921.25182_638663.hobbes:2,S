Sure, if we changed our build system, engineered a suitable small 
userspace, etc.  At this point it's easier to maintain a small patch to 
the kernel dhcp parsing code so that we can specify mtu.

I think the group scheduling stuff for CFS is closer, but there are 
design and API differences that would require us to rework our system.

No, more than proc/sysfs.  Things like notification of process state 
change (think like SIGCHLD but sent to arbitrary processes), additional 
messaging protocol families, oom-killer protection, dirty page 
monitoring, backwards compatibility for "dcbz" on the ppc970, nested 
alternate signal stacks, and many others.  Between our kernel vendor's 
patches and our own, there are something like 600 patches applied to the 
mainline kernel.

With the sctp hash patch applied we're now sitting with 45% cpu free on 
one cpu, and about 25% free on the other, and we're still seeing 
periodic bursts of rx fifo loss.  It's wierd.  Still trying to figure 
out what's going on.
