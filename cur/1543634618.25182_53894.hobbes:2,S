The interaction between iSCSI & driverfs does pose an interesting
problem:
On one hand I tend to lead toward the view of a physical device. 
The reason being that there will never be a distinction as far as the
kernel is concerned (other than driverfs of course) that a SCSI upper
level driver (hopefully soon to be a personality driver) using a iSCSI
Initiator low-level driver is not really a physical host. 
On the other hand there is the obvious fact that an iSCSI initiator
driver is not attached to a bus, and assuming /root/iSCSI.target/disk1
etc, is out of the question.  There is a real need for a solution to
handle virtual devices (as stated your previous message) that are not
assoicated with any physical connectors.  
Not being too fimilar with driverfs,  what are the options with regard
to virtual devices as things currently stand without tainting the
elegant tree that is provides?
