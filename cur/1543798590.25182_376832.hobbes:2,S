Well .. by opposite I meant one allows you to share specific contexts while
the other allows you to unshare specific contexts. In case of clone, by not
specifying flags you can also unshare, however the same is not true for
the unshare system call. That is, if you don't specify a flag, that 
structure
is left alone in its current state. It does not become shared if it was 
not being
shared to begin with.

I am in the process of writing up a more detailed description for this 
feature.
Description, which will include requirements, detail design and cost. When I
started, I did try to use as much of the existing code (clone, copy_*) as
possible, but I may have missed things. As I write things down, I will try
and see if I can make flags less confusing.
I am off for the next two weeks with limited email access so don't want to
rearrange stuff now.
