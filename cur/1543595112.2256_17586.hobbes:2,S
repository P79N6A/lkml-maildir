Is libgkcontents.so in use on the client? If so it's a known problem:
mmap() screws up the page cache invalidation routine
invalidate_inode_page(). If you do the untar on the client, then all
will be fine...
However the last time your report was of a problem in which the server
was corrupted, and the client was good. Was that a typo, or is it
still the case?
Cheers,
