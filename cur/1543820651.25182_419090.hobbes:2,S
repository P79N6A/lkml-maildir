Hi,
Would you include diffstat output also, as mentioned (optional)
in Documentation/SubmittingPatches?  I'd really like to see a list
of patched files without having to scan the entire patch.
Thanks.
Oh, the diff filenames should begin at the linux-2.x.y level so
that they can be applied with patch -p1.
Lots of tools know how to do this.

Use better spacing here:  (offset % 8)
