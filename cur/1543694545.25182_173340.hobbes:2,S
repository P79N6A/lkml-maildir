none of my directories have more than 60 or so entries.  I keep 
everything very organized on my hdds.  The largest directories would be 
the ones holding the largest files but that maxes out at around 60 file 
entries.  i formatted those partitions with a 4KB inode size.
outside of the two partitions with extents enabled though....  I'm not 
sure if i have any seriously large directories in my other partitions. 
And their inode size varies from 1KB to 4Kb depending on what type of 
content they're expected to have .

The only other patches i have are related to fbdev and directfb. 
Otherwise it's a vanilla 2.6.0-test7 + extents patch that you posted for it.

Workload on those partitions at the time?  It cant be anything more than 
mplayer reading a movie or writing a movie to disk.  And the writes 
would be at about 20MB/sec avg (ext3 to ext3 both with extents) from one 
drive (the partitions happen to be on separate drives) to the other. The 
transferrate spikes at 30MB/sec at start and stays at around 20MB/sec 
for upwards up 1GB for a file.
Nothing else is done on those partitions.  System wise though, what 
caused the crash to occur was updatedb, which does a find on every 
filesystem off of /.  This is what was running when the error occured, 
and it didn't happen this morning when it happened again, the error i 
mean.  I have dma enabled so updatedb doesn't cause significant 
schedular issues due to cpu usage. That's all that was going on at the 
time.
