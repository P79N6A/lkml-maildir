If [tag plus] multiple values are allowed on a line, the field 
separation needs to be unambiguous. So quoting/escaping is required 
in some cases. Spaces are common enough in a value that white space 
maybe doesn't make a very good field separator.
Or just quote all strings (and escape quotes). Interpret values as C 
would, 0x for hex, "... for strings, and so on for floating point, 
octal, &c. Heck, you could even have typing (3UL) or casts, though 
that's probably going too far.
