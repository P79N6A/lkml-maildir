With the patch none of the ordering gets changed, with the following 
exceptions, afaik:
1. When request_region would prevent something from probing over top of 
something else. This is a bug with my current patch, but a tough one to 
avoid because we normally don't request_resource until the probe 
function is called...
2. Any breakage that results from spliting probe1 into detect and setup:
    device on 0x300.
    driver x, and driver y.
    old:
       probe1 from driver x fails late in the routine. (after the place 
where the detect/setup split would occur)
       driver y probe1 succeds and it gets the device
    new:
       driver x detect succeceds.
       all other driver detects at 0x300 thus fail.
       driver x setup fails.
       nobody gets the device.
This is a driver issue and as long as the split of probe1 to 
detect/setup is done right there should be no problems.
Also ethX numbering could change because of the alloc/register_netdev is 
happening at module init time and not at autoprobe time.
