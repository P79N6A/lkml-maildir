I'll have to wait until tonight since I've only been able to trigger 
this
using dialup, and I don't have that here at work.  The failures were 
only
seen with PREEMPT of course, and very early in the testing I ran the
test on ext3 too, to exonerate reiserfs as a primary cause.  However, I
did not examine or preserve the RESYNC/SCCS/s.ChangeSet file on ext3
since I didn't know what the issues were at that early stage of testing.
So, I don't really know any details of the failure on ext3, apart from
the most superficial symptoms.

The "Assertion `s && s->tree' failed" happened fairly quickly (on the
3rd bk pull) on reiserfs with PREEMPT enabled.  I'll let you know
how ext3 behaves later tonight.
