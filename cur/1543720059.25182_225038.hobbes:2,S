Hi,
Is this drive fubar? It's installed brand-new, and after only three days
of operating it's giving me these errors from time to time.
May 30 07:08:18 web3 kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady
SeekComplete Error }
May 30 07:08:18 web3 kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 {
UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=227270012, sector=227270007
May 30 07:08:18 web3 kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector
227270007
I could find some other people on the net with these problems, but none
of them happened with brandnew drives. 
What can I do?
Rick Jansen
