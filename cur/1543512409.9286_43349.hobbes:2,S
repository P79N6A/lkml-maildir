Subject: Moving SYSRQ to another keycode.

My keyboard generates the following when SYSRQ is pressed.
ALT-PRSCREEN is SYSRQ and gives:
0x38 for alt key
0x54 0xD4 for ALT-SYSRQ
How do I change the #define in the kernel source to use this
sequence as per the sysrq.txt documentation?
Any help that anyone could give me to get this working - either
on or off list - I would be very greatful for.  I have not ran
applications that lose the keyboard mode for a long time, however
I just acquired Quake for Linux on CDROM, and now I have
something to do during those long downloads.  ;o)  Unfortunately,
switching between consoles loses keyboard state sometimes...
Thanks in advance for your help!
