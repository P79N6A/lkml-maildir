 Hello!
 Yes this has been considered and actually I think Jamal did this in one of
 the pre NAPI patch. I tried something similar... but instead of using a number
 of excess polls I was doing excess polls for a short time (a jiffie). This 
 was the showstopper mentioned the previous mails. :-) 
 Anyway it up to driver to decide this policy. If the driver returns 
 "not_done" it is simply polled again. So low-rate network drivers can have 
 a different policy compared to an OC-48 driver. Even continues polling is
 therefore possible and even showstoppers. :-)  There are protection for
 polling livelocks.
 Cheers.
