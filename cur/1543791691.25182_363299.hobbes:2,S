To provide a slightly shorter version ... we had one customer running
similarly large number crunching things in Fortran. Their app ran 25%
faster with large pages (not a typo). Because they ran a variety of
jobs in batch mode, they need large pages sometimes, and small pages
at others - hence they need to dynamically resize the pool. 
That's the sort of thing we were trying to fix with dynamically sized
hugepage pools. It does make a huge difference to real-world customers.
