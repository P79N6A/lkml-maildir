Hey all,
 I've been following Ingo Molnar and friends' lovely realtime-preempt
patchset.  I'm curious, though, the only piece of documentation I've
found is
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/older/ANNOUNCE-voluntary-preempt
 which is, indeed, quite old.   Is anyone planning on updating this in
the near future or is it in too much flux? Should I try and make heads or
tails of the code first?
