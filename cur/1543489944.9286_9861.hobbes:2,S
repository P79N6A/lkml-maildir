Have heard, that some people here were able to kill
root processes, when using 2.2.3. ac1 with redhat 5.2 
on some ix86 uniprocessor machines. I do not know, weather
this bug affects also 2.2.3. Somebody should just test it..
Actually the guys just wrote kill -15 -1 and many root
processes also were killed. And they said that that also
worked with kill -9 -1.
