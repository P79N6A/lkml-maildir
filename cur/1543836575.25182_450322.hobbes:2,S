how can I compile in support for Xen4 on my 2.6.18 kernel? after all xen 2 and 
xen3 are incompatable hypervisors so why wouldn't xen4 (and I realize there is 
no xen4 yet, but there is likly to be one during the time virtual servers 
created with 2.6.18 are still running)

distros don't offer kernels with all options today, why would they in the future 
(how many distros offer seperate 486/586/K6/K7/Pentium/P2/P3/P4 kernels, none. 
they offer a least-common denominator kernel or two instead)
I also am missing something here. how can a system be compiled to do several 
different things for the same privilaged opcode (including running that opcode) 
without turning that area of code into a performance pig as it checks for each 
possible hypervisor being present?
