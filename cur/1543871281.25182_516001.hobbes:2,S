This idea is fine.  But:

We'll need to make sure the appropriate 'arp_anounce' address
selection is employed here.
One idea is to change arp_solicit() such that it can be invoked in
this context, or provide a new helper function which will do the
source address selection rules of 'arp_announce' and then invoke
arp_send() as appropriate for us.
