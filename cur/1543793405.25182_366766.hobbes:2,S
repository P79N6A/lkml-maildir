Hi !
 while looking for a posibly work queue related problem i noticed
 that the return value of schedule_work/scheule_delayed_work is not
 checked in the networking code (and in other cases aswell) - is there
 a particular reason for this - or has it just been forgotten ?
 Atleast in the network code it looks like events could be silently
 lost. (net/core/link_watch.c ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c etc.) 
thx !
