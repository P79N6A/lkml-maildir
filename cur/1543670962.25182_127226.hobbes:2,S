You shouldn't need to know where the BIOS code is "relative to
current code segment."  It "should be" in hex 0:e000-ffff.
You should be able to use some segment reg. = 0 to search.
I see that Dick just corrected this, just as I was about to do:
Typical PC BIOSen are at segment 0xe000:0 thru 0xf000:ffff,
not segment 0 and offsets as you have them listed.
Are you using a typical PC BIOS or something else?
