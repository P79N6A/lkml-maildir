What constitutes 'a piece of data'?  A bit? a byte?
I would say that 
   msdos:fd
is one piece of data.  The 'fd' is useless without the 'msdos'.
The 'msdos' is, I guess, not completely useless with the fd.
I would lean towards the composite, but I wouldn't fight a separation.

partition-type based autodetect is easily fooled.
If you take a pair of drives from a failed computer, plug them into a
similar computer for data recovery, and boot:  you might have two
different pairs of drives that both want to be 'md0'.  Which wins?
I believe there needs to be a clear, non ambigous, causality path from
the kernel paramters, initramfs, or machine hardware that leads to the
arrays to be assembled and hence the filesystem to be mounted.  These
should identify the array by some reasonably unique identifier.  The
'minor number' stored in the raid superblock and used by
partition-based autodetect is not 'reasonably unique'.
There are many many possibilites.  Some are:
 kernel parameter  md=0,/dev/hda,/dev/hdc
    'hda' and 'hdc' on 'this' machine are (I think) still unique
    identifiers of hardware, and so this can identify drives to assemble
    into an array.  Note that this would *not* be reliable with
          md=0,/dev/sda,/dev/sdb
 kernel parameter md_root_uuid=xxyy:zzyy:aabb:ccdd...
    This could be interpreted by an initramfs script to run mdadm 
    to find and assemble the array with that uuid.  The uuid of 
    each array is reasonably unique.
 initramfs containing preconfigured /etc/mdadm.conf
    This mdadm.conf would contain the uuid's of the arrays to
    assemble.
 kernel hardware MAC address
    This could be mapped through DHCP to a host name.  The host name
    is then given to mdadm such that it finds and assemble the array
    with 'name' (only supported in version-1 superblocks) of
         $HOST-root
    or whatever.
Just as there is a direct unambiguous causal path from something
present at early boot to the root filesystem that is mounted (and the
root filesystem specifies all other filesystems through fstab)
similarly there should be an unambiguous causal path from something
present at early boot to the array which holds the root filesystem -
and the root filesystem should describe all other arrays via
mdadm.conf
Does that make sense?
