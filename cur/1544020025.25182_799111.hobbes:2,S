That is wrong. ondemand sampling_rate should not limit the sampling rate
based on HZ when NO_HZ is configured. The idle statistics is not limited
by HZ rate with NO_HZ, as we will have idle microaccounting.

ondemand polling uses deferrable timer and hence will not be called
frequently on a totally idle CPU. The main reason we did not do the
dynamic sampling_rate is because it increases the ondemand response time
with a sudden increase of load, which is not liked by most workloads.
