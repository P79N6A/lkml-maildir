Disappointed.
    Vojtech> Is using Alt+printscreen such a big difference?
That means I need to press FOUR keys to use sysrq, because PrintScreen
is  only  available via  [Fn].   That becomes  [Fn]+Alt+PrintScreen+X,
where "X" is the sysrq function.  :(

Isn't  the keyboard  driver  supposed to  iron  out such  differences?
Isn't  it your  philosophy that  the drivers  should know  the devices
well, and present  a consistent interface to the  upper layers?  Then,
the correct way to do it is:
        USB keyboard driver: generate a "sysrq" event in reaction to
                             Alt-PrintScreen 
        AT/PS2 keyboard driver: generate a "sysrq" when receiving a
                                0x54 keycode
The  kernel  keyboard  handler  shouldn't  see  or  bother  about  the
difference.   It is  insane that  the handler  has to  care  about the
status of the Alt keys.
    Vojtech> Further, keycode 99 is KEY_SYSRQ, as defined in input.h,
Then, why use it for PrintScreen?   With the 'evbug' facility, I see a
keyboard  event with code  KEY_SYSRQ when  I press  PrintScreen.  Just
PrintScreen, not  Alt-PrintScreen.  So,  this is a  feature and  not a
bug?
    Vojtech> and is used for the PrtScr/SysRq key. 
So, why not have seperate keycodes for the two?
