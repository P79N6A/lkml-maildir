Tables are wonderful.  I use tables to abstract small differences
between chipsets served by a single driver.  Take a look at what is done
in recent clgenfb drivers.  Tables are compact, can be marked with
__initdata to save memory, and make extensibility very easy.  
In the case above, you can create a probe table marked with __initdata,
to dump the chip names after you probe and print them out.
