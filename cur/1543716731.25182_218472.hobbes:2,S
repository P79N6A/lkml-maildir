Hi,
I am having to port linux to a new architecture. This architecture does not
have gcc ported on to it. This does have an ansi c compiler.
Has anyone has had any experience/success with building linux with an ansi c
compiler. I know it does not build automagically, but any info on
deviations/changes/tools would be appreciated a LOT.
thanks in advance,
dominique
