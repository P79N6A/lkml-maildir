From gcc manpage:
       -mpreferred-stack-boundary=num
           Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to num
           byte boundary.  If -mpreferred-stack-boundary is not specified, the
           default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits), except when optimizing for
           code size (-Os), in which case the default is the minimum correct
           alignment (4 bytes for x86, and 8 bytes for x86-64).
So -mpreferred-stack-boundary=4 is the default and to align stack
to 8 bytes you want -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3, not 4, IIUC.
