For my x86_64 usualconfig .text (from objdump --headers) went from
0x002c55c7 down to 0x002c2bda, which is 10.5k saved.
According to /usr/bin/size, vmlinux got bigger:
box:/usr/src/25> size vmlinux 
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3597448  716340  510456 4824244  499cb4 vmlinux-before
3640604  716228  510456 4867288  4a44d8 vmlinux-after
But that's because size(1) is too blunt an instrument: the sum of .text and
the new bug section got larger.
I think we need to thank the powerpc guys, then take away their function
name printing ;)
