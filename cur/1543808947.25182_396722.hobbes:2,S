Yes, it does (I moved to 2.6.15.4 in the same step, though).
Unfortunately my PC freezes as soon as I start a 3D game (Enemy
Territory True Combat Elite) when I see the first few 3D ingame frames.
Running glxgears is fine, as is running multiple instances of VLC to
output several audio streams through one device.
Switching off the sound in ET:TCE does not help at all.
Bye,
