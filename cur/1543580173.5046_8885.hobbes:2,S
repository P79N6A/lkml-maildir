Hi,
   Ok, it appears that I have 2.4.1-pre10 working properly again.  Looks
like the changes Andy made to the acpi_idle stuff was the problem.  I made
the change Andy suggested on the acpi list, namely commenting out the line
"pm_idle = acpi_idle;" at the bottom of /usr/src/linux/drivers/acpi/cpu.c,
which seems to fix the problem.
This patch makes it clear what I did:
