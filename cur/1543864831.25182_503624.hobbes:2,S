Hi,
I try to test a programm, that manages ca. 120000 connections at the
same time.
Now I want to test it with a full route cache. I can only test it from
some Test-PC's.
So the route cache ist nearly empty all the time.
I tried to fill the route cache with pktgen amongst others with the
appended configuration, but my route cache is always nearly empty.
In my log this error appears:  "eth0: too many iterations (6) in
nv_nic_irq."
I use Kernel "2.6.16.13-4-smp".
Where is the problem ?
Thanks in advance
Markus Wenke
