So she installed it herself, why isn't $distrovender kernel good enough?
Keep in mind that just because $kernelversion has a bug doesn't mean
that $distrovender-$kernelversion does.  So yes, relying on an update
from $distrovendor is a good thing.  What if your automagic tool existed
and Aunt Tillie clicked when 2.4.15 was current stable?

Would you accept She'll almost never need something thats not in her
current $distrovednor kernel or the one $distrovendor is working on?
