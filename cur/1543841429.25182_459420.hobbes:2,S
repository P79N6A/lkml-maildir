What I see happening is this;
1. setup_arch calls e820_register_active_regions(0, 0, -1UL) so that all
    regions are registered as if they were on node 0 so e820_end_of_ram()
    gets the right value
2. remove_all_active_regions() is called to clear what was registered so
    that rediscovery with NUMA awareness happens
3. acpi_numa_init() is called. It parses the table and a little later
    calls acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init() for each range in the table so
    now we're into x86_64 code
4. acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init() basically deals an address range.
    Assuming the SRAT table is not broken, it calls
    e820_register_active_ranges() for that range. At this point, for the
    range of addresses, the active ranges are now registered
5. reserve_hotadd is called if the range is hotpluggable. It will fail if
    it finds that memory already exists there
So, when absent_pages_in_range() is being called by reserve_hotadd(), it 
should be using the same information that was available in e820. What am I 
missing?
