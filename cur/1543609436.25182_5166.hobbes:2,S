Why not read everything into a 1024-bit signed variable? Will work for 
every numeric value in /proc. It's a bit of a hassle to code, but it is 
possible. You only need to know the type if you want to write a numerical 
value to a file in /proc, and even then the driver behind that /proc entry 
should do sanity checks.
