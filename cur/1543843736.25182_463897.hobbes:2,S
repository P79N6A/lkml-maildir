I was thinking about this, and the difference between "other filesystems"
and unionfs in this case is that the example above is just stat. During
copyup, unionfs has to copy the file to another filesystem. How is it
supposed to do that when it doesn't understand what the file is?
Sure, when unionfs does stat, fubared statdata is fine, but during
copyup...bad things could potentially happen.
Any suggestions how to copyup an unknown file type?
