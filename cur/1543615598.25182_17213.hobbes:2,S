Um, actually I don't remember anything Linus asked for from us, probably 
he did, but if I can't remember it then it probably was not significant 
(oh wait, he asked for terseness in the licensing statements at the top 
of every file.  Surely he asked for something else also, but it was 
trivial.)
That said, Andre, if you want more testers we can put a link to your 
code on our download page, and if you want someone to read your code and 
tell you what parts aren't easy to understand (I haven't read your new 
code yet), we'll help with that also.
