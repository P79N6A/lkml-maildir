remember that there are the nightly CVS dumps and patches being created as 
well.
from my point of view it appears that when Linus releases -rc1 he is 
hopeing that it's actually going to be final, but since nobody bothers to 
test before that it has never actually been the case. As a result 
additional changes need to be done and Linus chooses to fix it by moving 
forward and doing additional fixes rather then by reverting patches. He 
does allow some additional patches to move in as well for a little while, 
but all of them are expected to be fixes.
