Subject: 2GB malloc impossible ?

I'm trying to allocate 2GB of Physical memory from user program. (I do
have that much so I use 2:2 split of address spaces).
The fact is that malloc'ing more than 1.3G results in ENOMEM. I tried to
track the problem down and found that mmap wants to map desired region
starting from something like 0x2aaab000. No wonder it couldn't map more
than 0x80000000 - 0x2aaab000 bytes.
I have no idea about where 0x2aaab000 has come from, but I am eager to
know. If anybody has the solution, or any suggestions, please, let me
know.
Regards,
Alexander.
