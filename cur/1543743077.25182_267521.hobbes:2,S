  Thanks - that sheds some light on things. I've had some success with
2.6.8 and thought it was a problem with the 2.4 series, but I've now
recompiled 2.4.27 with CONFIG_ACPI and it does work.
  Am I right in thinking that without CONFIG_ACPI, 2.4.27 simply trusts
the BIOS to set up ACPI? If so, I should talk to Supermicro as it sounds
like it might be a BIOS problem.
	Thanks,
