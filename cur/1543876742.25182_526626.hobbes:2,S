These days I think it's usually best to have ACPI on with current 
systems. Although it's not as bad with servers, many machines are 
designed to run only Windows (which normally always uses ACPI) and 
simply aren't tested well or at all with ACPI disabled so you can run 
into a lot of problems which are just bugs in the BIOS, etc.
Also, on the server side, if ACPI is disabled you can't take advantage 
of CPU clock frequency scaling to save power.
