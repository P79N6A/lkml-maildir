Some scsi drivers like ips access to sglist in a tricky way. I feel
that they don't work with the sg_ring interface well. So if you
convert scsi_lib.c to use sg_ring, please see how it works with the
tricky drivers before that.

I'm SCSI-biased. If you don't convert scsi to use sg_ring, I don't
complain. :) Though it would be better to have only one mechanism to
handle large sglist in kernel.
