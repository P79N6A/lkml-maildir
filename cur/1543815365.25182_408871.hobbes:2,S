Constructors work well for things like lock and and list initialization 
where the object state is naturally in 'initial' state when free'd. They 
don't work well for unconditional zeroing for the exact reasons you 
outline below.

I assume the design comes from Bonwick's paper which states that the 
purpose of object constructor is to support one-time initialization of 
objects which we're _not_ doing in this case.
