We've been through that already.  If it's a busy-wait it
should use cpu_relax.  If it's scheduling away that already
forces the compiler to reread anyway.
Do you have an actual example where volatile is needed?

Can't argue since you left out what those expectations
or properties are.

Do you (or anyone else for that matter) have an example of this?
