I tried to test UML, and tried 2.5.36 through to 38, but have been
unable to comile it. I tried using the default config, as well as
my own config, but both 37 and 38 give the following error.
  gcc -Wp,-MD,./.sched.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.38/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2  -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -g  -U__i386__ -Ui386 -D__arch_um__ -DSUBARCH=\"i386\" -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.38/arch/um/include -Derrno=kernel_errno -nostdinc -iwithprefix include    -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DKBUILD_BASENAME=sched   -c -o sched.o sched.c
