I'm not sure what you mean by "Raid block," and a stripe size on 64k is 
improbably low. That sounds like a chunk size using common nomenclature. 
You don't say what RAID level you are using, nor what filesystem type, 
so it's really hard to give you any useful help, other than "send more 
information, use standard terms, send to the linux-raid list, not kernel."
By "format a partition" do you mean "create an array?" Or ???
