I have checked it out.
Seems like there is absolutely no way to configure the source
port gdb uses for the udp connection. So one must invoke a
"target remote udp:ip:port" command, see what was the
chosen source port (tcpdump/netstat), and reconfigure kgdb on the target.
While this works, it is rather awkward.
Do you think there is/can be another way to solve this issue
(like allowing NETPOLL to listen to a wildcard udp source port) ?
thank you
