Hi -- could you please CC me if you reply to this mail.
My problem is that I get an error when setting up the following
configuration:
A:     /exports/A                                 - Redhat 7.0
B1/B2: mount /exports/A on /export/A from A       - Redhat 6.2
C:     mount /exports/A on /mnt/A from B1 or B2   - Redhat 6.2
I use knfsd/nfs-utils on each machine.
bash# ls /mnt/A
/mnt/A/A.txt: No such file or directory
I searched for a while on deja.com, and there seemed to be some indications
that knfsd was bugged and that using the user-mode code would work.
However, no one replied specifically to my message, so I'm still not sure.
BTW, what I tried to do was to set up a HA configuration of machines B1/B2
using A as a "shared disk".
This is just to try out the HA software without buying more hardware.
Thanks in advance for any help!
Best regards,
Frank Olsen
PS Happy new year!
