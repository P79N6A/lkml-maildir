Randy,
Thanks for reviewing the code!
My comments embedded.
I'll re-send the patches as soon as possible.

Tuning down is recommended in order to come back to the default tunable 
value.
I agree with you: today it has quite no effect, except on the tunable 
value. If we take the ipc's example, grow_ary() just returns if the new 
tunable value happens to be lower than the previous one.
But we can imagine, in the future, that grow_ary could deallocate the 
unused memory.
+ in that particular case, lowering the tunable value makes the 1st loop 
in ipc_addid() shorter.

Actually a tunable is activated to be dynamically adjusted (whatever the 
direction).
But you are giving me an idea for a future enhancement: we can imagine a 
tunable that could be allowed to increase only (or decrease only). In 
that case, we should move the autotune sysfs attribute into an 'up' and 
a 'down' attribute?

That's exactly what I did?

Since the tunables that are handled in AKT, I wanted the feature to be 
close to CONFIG_PROC_FS.
Now, I do not agree with your proposal: putting it after the FS menu 
means that it would appear in the main menu, right? I'll try to find a 
better place for it.

Actually, I wanted the changes to the existing kernel files to be as 
small as possible. That's why everything is concentrated, whenever 
possible, in the added files.
