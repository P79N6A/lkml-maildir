Because mixing spaces and tabs is often ugly.  8 spaces and a
single tab often do not have the same width when you're viewing
the text in a variable width font.
I've read all my mail in a variable width font for over a decade, at
first to watch for regressions in the XEmacs display engine, but I
continued because I liked it.  I presume I'm not the only one doing
so.
