I notice fs/filesystems.c has
#ifdef CONFIG_NLS
	init_nls();
#endif
So NLS support is something that gets built into the kernel proper, but the
codepages can be built as modules.
Maybe the NLS menu needs to have a separate
[ ] Enable NLS support
option at the top, which makes the code pages available when selected. That
would make it obvious that NLS support was a kernel feature.
