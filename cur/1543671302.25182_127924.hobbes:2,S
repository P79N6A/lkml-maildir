If they had I have a feeling that a billion and 1 coders would've
swarmed upon it and coded something up, or nvidia would've just released
the proper source code.
Unfortunately, I believe they're still sitting comfortably with a
geforce4 up their butts, keeping them nice and warm.
If you want you can send them a nice, polite letter (as angry/emotional
ones are likely to do more harm then good) explaining why you feel the
current state of affairs is wrong and why they should correct it (and
how).
