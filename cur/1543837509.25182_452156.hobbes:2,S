Sorry about that. I do not have any control over the email list. I will
change the maintainer info entry to indicate that users should just send
mail to me or linux-scsi.

We have change the code a little since the analysis was made. But, it
does not really matter much now. I am fine with us just grabbing the
session lock or xmitmitex (I will send a patch and test it as well) if
your barrier patch is not accepted. We grab the session lock in the fast
path now so there is not much benefit left for us.
