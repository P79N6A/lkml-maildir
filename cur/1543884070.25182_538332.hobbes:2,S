I am a fan of this, but I hadn't really realized that it's in -mm, and
that it has to be enabled with kernelcore=
Now that I am, I'm running it on my laptop with kernelcore=256M (it
wouldn't boot with 128M or less, weird initscript errors and OOMs).
1 GB single-core laptops are probably not the intended test audience :)
But I'll see what happens.
