I was just wondering if anyone had plans to implement a DHCP client in
the kernel.Something that would listen for an ip that could be loaded as
a module. --Just an idea-- Im not an experienced C programmer but would
like to mess with this idea. If anyone has any ideas for more info
please email them to me.
Thanks
