LSM stacking has always been contentious and I don't see
that it addresses the issue, which is changing the data used
by an LSM, not the LSM itself.

The objection centers around exposing LSM specific data outside
the LSM, and it applies to either secids or blobs, really. If you
need this information outside the LSM odds are good that what you're
using it for is going to be LSM specific, and hence should be inside
the LSM. I admit to two gray areas, audit and system service tasks
such as the two cited here. I like simplicity and find the single
security_act_as() interface attractive for the latter case.
