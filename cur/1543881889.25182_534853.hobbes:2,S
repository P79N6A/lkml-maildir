Linus, the fact that you personally don't use S2D does not mean it's not
useful for other people. I've been using solely laptop for six years and
until recently (when my commute is now only two miles) I'd always used
hibernate when I go to or leave form work. And even now if I take my laptop
to somewhere farther away (like on a vacation) I need hibernation.
This is one area where Windows has been doing great for many years, and it's
not like Linux has not had a mature implementation for many years either. So
don't you think your comments are a bit odd at this point?
