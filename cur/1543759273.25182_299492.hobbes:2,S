Hello,
i'm dealing with some tcp modifications in linux kernel and surely i need debugging
for these purposes i use User Mode Linux and it works ok but the problem debugging namely tcp (or any other network protocol, i suppose) is different tcp-timeouts while I tracing the code (tracing looks like much slower execution of a program...)...
i need the idea how i can "freeze" all the time variables in linux tcp  protocol to be independent from time while debugging code...
maybe there's some standard solution..? i don't know
sorry for probably silly question..
i'm not subscribed to maillist so i need to be personally CC'ed...
thanks,
