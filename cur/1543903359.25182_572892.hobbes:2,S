What am I missing in the following suggested solution?
1) In the freezer code, we implement a new TIF_LATEFREEZE process flag, which, 
when set, causes a  userspace process to be frozen with kernel threads 
instead of with userspace ones. When freezing, we freezing !TIF_LATEFREEZE, 
sync and then freeze TIF_LATEFREEZE and freezable kernel threads.
2) In the fuse code, the PID of the process that will do the work gets passed 
to the fuse kernel code when the mount is done. The kernel code sets the 
TIF_LATEFREEZE flag, and resets it on umount.
Sorry, but this is a hit-and-run email - I'm off to bed now.
Regards,
Nigel
