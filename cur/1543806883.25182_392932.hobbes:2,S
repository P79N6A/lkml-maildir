After the first drive fails you have no redundancy, the chance of an 
additional failure is linear to the number of remaining drives.
Assume:
   p - probability of a drive failing in unit time
   n - number of drives
   F - probability of double failure
The chance of a single drive failure is n*p. After that you have a new 
"independent trial" for the failure any one of n-1 drives, so the chance 
of a double drive failure is actually:
   F = (n*p) * (n-1)*p
But wait, there's more:
   p - chance of a drive failing in unit time
   n - number of drives
   R - the time to rebuild to a hot spare in the same units as p
   F - probability of double failure
So:
   F = n*p * (n-1)*(R * p)
If you rebuild a track at a time, each track takes the time to read the 
slowest drive plus the time to write the spare. If the array remains in 
use load increases those times.
And the ugly part is that p is changing all the time, there's infant 
mortality on new drives, fairly constant electronic probability and 
increasing probability of mechanical failure over time. If all of your 
drives are the same age they are less reliable than mixed age drives.

If you're paranoid you mirror over two RAID-5 arrays. The mirrors are on 
independent controllers. RAID-10.

A small graph of the effect of the rebuild time on RAID-5 attached, it 
assumes probability of failure = 1/1000 per the original post, for 
various rebuild times the probability of failure drops.
