Thats why the subject of resource control keeps re-surfacing. It takes the
ability to have resource accounting to be able to identify that which
is violating some usage policy. Without the accounting data, the only way
to choose is nearly random.

Ummm, It was my impression that the kernel did not discard drivers as long
as there was an open file using the file system.
In ether case, if I were depending on it, then I would load the driver
explicitly at boot time, and leave it there permanently.
As far as "no overcommit" being foolish - the current implementation is
what you get whenever memory is over committed. Personally, I thing the
ability to overcommit should be optional. If I don't want to overcommit then
I disable it. Does that mean I have to have a bigger swap space ? sure, and
I accept it. Disks are cheap. An aborted 3 month process can be very expensive.

On many systems that I have used, I had the ability to put quota limits
on the amount of virtual memory a user could use. If the user exceeded
that amount, then the users processes (whichever one just asked for too much)
got aborted with the equivalent of a "virtual memory quota exceeded" signal.
This allowed me to allocate the swap space based on:
	u = maximum number of concurrent users
	q = quota space allocated to each user
	r = quota space for root
	swap space = u * q + r
There are other formulae - u * q  may be a summation if q is different
for each user. At that point q would become the max of all users quotas.
Is this too much - sure, but there won't be any random aborts either.
