On a slightly related topic, I've recently submitted a cleaned up version
of the driver for the moschip 7830 USB-ethernet chip. I included the only
address from Moschip that was known to me in all correspondence, but never
got any comment from them.
Is there anyone from moschip that is qualified to comment on my code,
or maybe even take over maintenance?
