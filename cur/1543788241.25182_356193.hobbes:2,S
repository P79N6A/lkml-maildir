That's a hugely counterintuitive potential security hole in waiting.
Because any number of permissions can be inherited (anything from none
of them, to all of them), this means that upon copying a file *you
cannot reliably tell what its permissions will become* without checking
it.
I don't think I need to point out the flaw in such a scheme.

I consider this a substantial *disadvantage*. Changing permissions should
be something that you have to explicitly do: it shouldn't happen quietly
behind your back merely on account of a rename().

This is what per-process namespaces are for.

i.e., the filename is *not* invisible, but trivially determinable by a
sufficiently determined attacker; sticking the file in a non-readable
directory is doable *now*, and *already* lacks this weakness.
i.e., the feature is useless.

Linux seems to be stealing all its good ideas bit by bit, so you'll
know sooner or later. :)
But per-process namespaces are *wonderful*. Goodbye, PATH, for instance:
just mount every binary this user should see in this user's /bin. He
gets his own /tmp, and /home contains *his home directory*.
(Special considerations have to be made for privileged processes: we
don't want the user to be able to fake them out by fooling with /etc,
say, or with their shared libraries. Perhaps setuid programs revert to a
standard namespace, and can see the user's one in
/proc/self/nonprivileged-root or something.)
