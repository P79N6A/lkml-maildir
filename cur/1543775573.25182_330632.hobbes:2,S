Please, correct me if I am wrong, but this doesn't seem to include any
fixes for the SBP2 problems that I was seeing, right?
I generated a patch from Linus's 2.6.13-rc1 against the trunk of
linux1394.org's tree containing (as Ben Collins suggested), just the
differences on sbp2.[ch] and it applied without any problems (no skips, no
rejects, no nothing) in -rc1-mm1.
I have not tested -rc1-mm1 without the patch, but assuming that all other
things are equal regarding it, I need this patch for using Firewire on my
computer.
Is there any estimated possibility of including an update from the
linux1394 team in future versions of -mm or, even better, pushing them to
Linus's tree?
Thank you very much, Rogério.
