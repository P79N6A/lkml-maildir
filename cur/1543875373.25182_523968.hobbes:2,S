If you actually clear the bit, you need to:
+         pte_update_defer(vma->vm_mm, addr, ptep);
The reason is, when updating PTEs, the hypervisor must be notified.  
Using atomic operations to do this is fine for all hypervisors I am 
aware of.  However, for hypervisors which shadow page tables, if these 
PTE modifications are not trapped, you need a post-modification call to 
fulfill the update of the shadow page table.

Same here.
Hugh, thanks for the cc.
