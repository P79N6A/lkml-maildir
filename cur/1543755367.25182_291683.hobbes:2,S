Sure. That's what the patch was made for. Or do you have anything else
in mind than BSD accounting?

Yes, that's what I wrote: A process would be uniquely identified by the
(btime, pid) pair, in terms of BSD accounting field names. Or
(start_time, pid), if we use the names of task_struct members.

Yes, but that would need new infrastructure. So instead of assigning new
64 bit process handles, we can just just that pair of 32 bit variables.

That's the kind of comment I was actually seeking - maybe what I'm trying 
is not really worth because anyone interested in its reliability and 
security would use auditing anyways.
But still it might be useful for 'home use', because I do have an idea of 
what the parent was if I keep the BSD accounting records.
