He quite clearly said "*lawfully-created* derivative works".
http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000106----000-.html
quite clearly says that the right to *produce* a derivative work can be controlled
by the copyright holder (17 USC 106(2)) but nothing in 17 USC 106 says that
the copyright holder can control the distribution of an *already-authorized*
derivative work.
IANAL and all that....
