The base certainly should be reset o fork.  Yes, this might expand the
region in which descriptors are allocated due to inherited descriptors.
 But I consider this the application's problem and it usually is not
really an issue.  Apps have to explicitly request using the new
descriptors and they can use CLOEXEC (CLOFORK) correctly.
