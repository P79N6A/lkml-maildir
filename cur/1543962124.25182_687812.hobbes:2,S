The problem is reproducible, as I wrote, also while booting through 
init=/bin/bash parameter(and in init 1, but with hang instead of reboot) 
so before loading any modules or nvidia drivers(but this case leaves no 
logs becouse logging is down too)
I mentioned first and last line as commented, just to ensure that it's 
everything about this symptome(timestamps suggest that)
