Thanks. Already found, tried, does not work.
It doesn't even convert register names properly. I know enough of sed to fix
broken scripts resulting from incorrect line wrapping, but I'm certainly not
going to work on this. 
I started to work on converting it to gas, but I stopped after the first
hour. It's just too much work to be fun. I won't convert it.
