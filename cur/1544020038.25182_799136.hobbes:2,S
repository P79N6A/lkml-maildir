The variable "max_delta_ns" is used by the dynamic tick to govern the 
maximum time a given device can sleep. Hence, this variable should be 
configured as necessary for the device you are using. Therefore, if your 
device has a timer that will wrap every 2.5 seconds, then for this 
device the "max_delta_ns" should be configure so that it does not exceed 
this time.
So what I was proposing is that for devices that have timers that would 
allow you to sleep beyond ~2.15 seconds (current max imposed by the 
clockevent_delta2ns function), why not increase the dynamic range (make 
this a 64-bit variable) or base (ie. from nanoseconds to milliseconds) 
to permit longer sleep times for devices that can support them? This 
should not have any negative impact on devices that cannot support such 
long sleep times.
So far I have not encountered any issues with doing this. Let me know if 
this does or does not address your concerns.
