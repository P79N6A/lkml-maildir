I have never let it lock the pages in workstation use and it has still
worked ok. Just comment out "#define HAVE_MLOCKALL 1" in config.h after
configure.
If you want to use it as a server you might want to use locking but to get a
smaller memory footprint you might want to link xntpd statically so that it
won't lock the pages of the shared libc.
