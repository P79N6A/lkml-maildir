Agreed. I did not like local_irq_enable() in cpuidle either, but added it
anyway as it was a corner case when cpuidle is active and no driver is
active and not a common case. I thought we will have it as a bandaid solution
until enter_idle, exit_idle is around.
Andi/Stephane: What are the plans around enter_idle exit_idle in x86-64.
Is it still being used by perfmon for x86-64 arch?
