Unless you're using RS485, which gives you interesting, and extremely 
important, properties like real-time performance guarantees, higher 
reliability,.... 
Of course, perhaps if you used ARCnet instead of Ethernet, it'd be a different 
story, but there's definitely a case for using RS485 for high-speed, real time 
communications links.

Many fieldbus protocols are based on RS485, and I'm seeing a lot of interest 
in running fieldbus protocols on Linux. These run speeds of up to 12Mb/s
I'd like to support the lowest level of various protocols, such a Profibus,
CAN, etc., as line disciplines, with the higher layers of the protocols in a
user-space library. 
In order to do this we need support for high speed interfaces, and also for
synchronous operation.
The Infra-Red people have worked round this by providing dedicated drivers for
driving a 16550 synchronously. I don't really think that's a good idea,
and I was quite glad to see the N_HDLC synchronous-tty support which arrived
circa 2.2.5.
If we make the normal serial driver support this synchronous-tty mode, then it
can be used for IR support, and also fieldbus support, and the duplicate
drivers can be dropped.
