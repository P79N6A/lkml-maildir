No, it was not. The reason of the change was to close several bad (read:
fs-corrupting) races in ext2. Locking didn't change, BTW - it's still
under BKL. List of the crap that required that fixing will be posted as
soon as fix will be in 2.2 - I'm not too happy about posting "here's how
user nobody can chew the fs, fsck quotas, eat reserved blocks and panic
your box" recipes. If you want it right now - ask and I'll send it
off-list. BTW, if you volunteer to help with minix/sysv/UFS - be my guest,
they require the same bunch of fixes.
