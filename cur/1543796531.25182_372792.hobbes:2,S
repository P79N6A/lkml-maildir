MacOSX is developed this way?  I think you will find a lot of Apple
engineers disagree with you...
And BSD is also quite different than Linux in many different ways, the
development community being one of these differences.  And that one
difference makes a lot of difference.

That will not work.  Again, go back and read that thread.  We seeing
this shorter development cycle get backed up even when it streaches to 2
months.  For it to go to 6 months would be madness.
If you don't understand why I say this, please go look at the different
developer trees that start accumilating patches during this "bugfix
only" timeframe.

And you believe that the enterprise distros will some how flock to this
kernel release instead?  Why would they?  What would it gain them?
