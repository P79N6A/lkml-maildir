I don't know if they will be included in the kernel distribution or not.
But they will be part of the kernel build process, if only to copy them
to the ramfs image which is then added to the kernel image.
The dietHotplug program will need to be built each time against the
kernel that it is going to be bundled up with (that's how it gets the
size improvements.)
Maybe in the end, specialized programs like dietHotplug will become part
of the kernel source tree, due to them being so tightly bound to it.
Does anyone else have any thoughts about this?

These programs are basically the movement of a lot of existing in-kernel
code, to userspace.  And as they need to be bundled up within the kernel
image itself, they don't need to have to run on any kernel but that one.

Great!  We are needing a small libc for these userspace programs.  A
limited number of libc functions, and a clean syscall interface.

You didn't address this.  What are the future plans of porting dietLibc
to the platforms that are not currently supported by it (but are by
Linux)?

Agreed.
<good argument against dynamic linking snipped>
You don't have to convince me about not really wanting dynamic linking.
As I do not know how many programs other people want in their initramfs,
or the size of these programs, I don't know if the size of a loader and
the symbol tables will outweigh the size of statically linking all of
the individual programs themselves.
It's just something to be aware of that we might have to do in the
future, that's all.  And it's nice to see that dietLibc supports this :)

It was sent and received on the dietlibc mailing list on Jan 04, 2001.
It looks like the mailing list archive for the mailing list doesn't have
any messages for Jan, 2001, otherwise I would point you at it.  I can
forward it to you offline if you want me to.

These are great questions that need to be answered.  I've started a
different topic just for it.
