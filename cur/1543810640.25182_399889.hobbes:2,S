Thanks Badari, with that interface changes the mpage_readpage changes
look a lot nicer than my original version.  I'd like to second
the request to put it into -mm. 
And if the namesys folks could try out whether this works for their
reiser4 requirements it'd be nice.  If you have an even faster
->readpages I'd be interested in that secrete souce receipe for
further improvement to mpage_readpages.
