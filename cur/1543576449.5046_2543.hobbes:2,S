#define wake_up_all(x) __wake_up((x),TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)

It makes heaps of sense.  We've introduced into 2.2 an API
which has the same appearance as one in 2.4, but which is
subtly broken wrt the 2.4 one.
I suggest you change the names to something other than
add_waitqueue_exclusive() and TASK_EXCLUSIVE, add a
cautionary comment and then go ahead with your patch.
Except for this bit, which looks slightly fatal:
	/*
         * We can drop the read-lock early if this
         * is the only/last process.
         */
        if (next == head) {
                 read_unlock(&waitqueue_lock);
                 wake_up_process(p);
                 goto out;
        }
Once the waitqueue_lock has been dropped, the task at `p'
is free to remove itself from the waitqueue and exit.  This
CPU can then try to wake up a non-existent task, no?
