I haven't tracked down the cause yet, but a kernel built with all three
patches (list_replace_rcu, atomic_inc_return, and selinux.rcu take3) on
x86 doesn't allow an enforcing boot; it begins auditing denials _before_
the initial policy load (which should never happen, as
security_compute_av allows everything until the policy is loaded), and
prevents /sbin/init from loading the policy.
A few other comments on the patch:
+	new = kmalloc(sizeof(struct avc_node), GFP_ATOMIC);
+	if (!new)
+		return NULL;
Dynamically allocating the nodes at runtime (rather than pre-allocating
them and then just reclaiming them as necessary as in the current AVC)
worries me, as it introduces a new failure case for avc_has_perm. 
Denying permission to a resource due to transient memory shortage is not
good for robustness.  And changing the GFP_ATOMIC is not an option, as
calling context may not allow blocking.  Hence, pre-allocation seems
desirable, regardless of the locking scheme.
+static int avc_latest_notif_update(int seqno, int is_insert)
+{
+	int ret = 0;
+	static spinlock_t notif_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
+	unsigned long flag;
+
+	spin_lock_irqsave(&notif_lock, flag);
+	if (seqno < avc_cache.latest_notif) {
+		if (is_insert) {
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "avc:  seqno %d < latest_notif %d\n",
+			       seqno, avc_cache.latest_notif);
+			ret = -EAGAIN;
+		} else {
+			avc_cache.latest_notif = seqno;
+		}
+	}
+	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&notif_lock, flag);
+	return ret;
 }
In trying to merge the logic related to latest_notif, you've introduced
a bug - latest_notif should only be increased, never decreased.  See the
original logic from avc_control and avc_ss_reset prior to your patch. 
Those functions update the latest notif based on a policy change event. 
In the insert case, you are checking that the entry is not stale, i.e.
has a smaller seqno than the latest notification due to an interleaving
with a policy change event.
 
+			if (node->ae.avd.allowed != (node->ae.avd.allowed|requested))
+				avc_update_node(AVC_CALLBACK_GRANT
+				                ,requested,ssid,tsid,tclass);
 		}
The test seems unnecessary, as the function has already determined that
not all of the requested permissions were granted, so you should be able
to just unconditionally call avc_update_node here, and you only need to
pass it the denied set that has already been computed, as any other
permissions in requested were already allowed.
