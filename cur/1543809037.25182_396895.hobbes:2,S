Post-mortem time.   Why was it merged?
This patch was added to -mm on 8 November 2006.  Was merged into mainline
12 January 2006.  That's two months in -mm and one month in mainline.
I don't think it's reasonable to stretch the latency of scheduler patches
to even longer than three months and I doubt if that'll solve the problem.
Oh well, at least we found it.

Well I don't see any benchmark numbers in the original patch.  Just an
assertion that it "should" help something.
I'm more inclined to revert it and not add the sysctl (ugh) until we have a
good reason to do so.
