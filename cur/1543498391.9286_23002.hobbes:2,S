Let me briefly introduce that design. The goal is to provide useful
power management for devices like battery-powered palmtop computers,
like the Psion S5, Geofox One, or eventually WinCE machines.
The current source of the power management can be found in
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/psion/crash
+burn-22.patch.gz
with the core parts in include/asm-arm/arch-clps7110/pm.h and
drivers/char/pm_7110.h, and a reasonably clear application example in
drivers/char/serial_7110.c. (crash+burn is a series of patches that add
support for systems based on the CL-PS7110 system-on-a-chip.)
Also, slide 9 of
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/slides/le99-7k.ps.gz
should be helpful.
Things happen at several levels:
 - each device can be directly switched on or off. It can delay the
   transition indefinitely, if necessary (e.g. you won't want to power
   down a SCSI interface during a transfer). Requests are serialized.
 - each device has an idle timer associated with it. Whenever the device
   does something "interesting", it resets the idle time. When the device
   reaches its idle time, it is switched off.
 - when all other devices are asleep, the CPU itself can be put to sleep
   (e.g. auto-power-off on portable devices)
 - there is an instant global switch on/off, mainly to give users a clear
   and reliable way to bring down the system (e.g. before changing
   batteries, or when boarding a plane)
 - all the things above are in the kernel, accessible via /proc
 - more advanced policy, e.g. different timeouts depending on power levels
   or whether the device runs off batteries, etc., can be implemented by
   a user-space demon which receives power management events from the
   kernel via a character device
The design currently has the following limitations, which reflect the
situation on most palmtop-type systems:
 - only one multi-device policy in the kernel (i.e. enter CPU standby if
   everything else is asleep)
 - only one type of switch on/off (e.g. power button)
I would appreciate feedback on cases where this is too inflexible. Note
however that the user-space demon if free to implement policies of
arbitrary complexity. The purpose of the in-kernel parts is provide the
"busy" parts and to allow for useful operation also in the absence of
the user-space demon.
There are some more things that I need to fix or plan to look into
anyway:
 - more efficient idle timer design (e.g. sleep until next event instead
   of periodic polling)
 - fix the event model (global switch on/off is full of races and
   conflicts)
 - doesn't take into account timers, particularly not long-running ones
   (e.g. sleep(6*3600); wake_up_owner();) Doing this right will probably
   mean that a few short-running periodic timers need to be revamped too.
Comments welcome.
