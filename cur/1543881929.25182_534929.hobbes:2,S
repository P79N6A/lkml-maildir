Someone may wish to change the description of the Compaq Array 
Controllers under Block Devices to "HP" based controllers
for the HP appliances.  It's rather confusing and inaccurate since 
Compaq has not existed for several years now.  The controllers
come up and identify themselves as "HP Proliant" Controllers these days.
