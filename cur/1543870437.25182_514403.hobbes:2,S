this driver was originally written against 2.6.19.x as we havent
gotten the Blackfin arch into mainline yet so it's hard to track the
latest git
i'll pull the latest git and look into the pointers you've posted ...
and send out a sep patch for updating the documentation ;)

fair enough ... my other concern was that now i'll also have to
translate it back out in rtc_read_alarm so by maintaining everything
in common RTC terms, there would be no overhead

i dont rely on the manpages for kernel interfaces as they get stale
too fast ... i read the files found in Documentation, rtc.txt in this
case
i guess rtc.txt needs more stuff added to it
