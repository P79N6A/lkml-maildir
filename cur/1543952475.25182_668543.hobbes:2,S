It sounds like a few updates are in the pipeline, but I merged this series
as-is into -mm.
I'll normally push ntp changes through Thomas's git-hrt tree, however this
patch series has dependencies upon at least
introduce-explicit-signed-unsigned-64bit-divide.patch
convert-a-few-do_div-user.patch
rename-div64_64-to-div64_u64.patch
rename-div64_64-to-div64_u64-mm.patch
remove-div_long_long_rem.patch
so they can't go into git-hrt immediately.
The idealised algorithm is
- 2.6.26 opens
- Thomas merges git-hrt
- I merge the above patches
- I then send these ntp patches to Thomas
- He merges them into git-hrt
- He does another git-hrt -> Linus merge
And that's all OK, but various lags might cause us to miss the merge
window, as I merge the -mm stuff last, and some git-tree maintainers are
dawdlers.
So if Thomas wants to ack these I can merge them directly late in the
2.6.26 merge window.
