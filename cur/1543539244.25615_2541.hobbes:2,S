Me too. I own about 8 video cards. Only five fit in my system :-( I have 3
keyboards as well but I haven't built the sun keyboard to serial adapater
yet. I do have code that runs multihead now. It only works for vgacon and
mdacon and a special NVIDIA text mode driver. Which means I haven't
updated the fbdev layer yet. Its in the linux console project CVS. I just
tested it and it's against a test4 kernel which works fine. Give it a try.

The virge card is very different from other cards. Especially the streams
processor. Its also a pain in the neck to debug. It locks a machine very
easy :-(
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
