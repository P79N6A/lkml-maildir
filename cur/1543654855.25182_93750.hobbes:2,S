The problem with the "interactivity estimator" was observed on
dual CPU.  It has almost vanished in 2.4.20aa1 and I don't think
it needs any more attention.
(BTW: it is not possible to trigger this problem when the background
load is just one or more busywaits.  It has to be a compilation.  It
could be something to do with all the short-lived processes, or gcc -pipe)

This problem is the "changed sched_yield semantics".  It was actually
tested on uniprocessor.  The difference between 2.4 and 2.4-aa is
still noticeable here, but it is not a terrible problem now.

I'd agree that it's not a showstopper.  It's in the "could be improved
a bit sometime" department.
Post-2.4, well, spinning on sched_yield() is a silly way to implement
a graphical application and I don't believe we need to struggle to
support such a thing.
The Open Group say
     The sched_yield() function shall force the running thread to relinquish
     the processor until it again becomes the head of its thread list. It
     takes no arguments.
That's a bit vague, but it does tend to imply that a yield could
relinquish the CPU for a very long time.
