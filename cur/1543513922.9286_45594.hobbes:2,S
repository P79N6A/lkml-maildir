I just mangled my partition table the other day thanks to fdisk defaulting
to displaying cylinders only (I tried to delete and recreate a couple 
partitions to change numbering but they weren't _on_ cylinder boundaries 
to begin with)... I found a program called 'gpart' that scans the disk for
filesystems and creates a new partition table based on where it finds
them. A real lifesaver, of course you need enough of a rescue disk to run
it off of and someplace to compile it if you can't find a binary.
