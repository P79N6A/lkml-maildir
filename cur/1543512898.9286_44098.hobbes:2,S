This change doesn't have anything to do with stat as such.  But IMO, it
would be a very logical to do it at the same time.
I will code up a patch that adds this:
   - New struct dirent that matches the one in glibc.
   - getdirentries syscall.
     Like glibc's getdirentries, except that BASEP can be null and
     there's an additional flags argument.
     With appropriate flags, glibc's getdirentries will be able to call
     this syscall directly, avoiding the parsing and copying overhead
     and redundant syscalls it does at the moment.
   - Flags argument to distinguish:
       - d_type or no d_type
       - 32 bit or 64 bit offset.
     There's really no gain in the implementation using a separate
     syscall for the 64 bit readdir.  However if it's decided it's
     cleaner to use a separate syscall, say so and I'll do it.
