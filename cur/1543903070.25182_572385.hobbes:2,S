  as a short followup to my previous post, at the *very least*, a
cleanup that could be done now is to find all entries which have an
actual dependency on "EXPERIMENTAL" but don't advertise themselves as
such:
...
config MA600_DONGLE
        tristate "Mobile Action MA600 dongle"
        depends on IRTTY_SIR && DONGLE && IRDA && EXPERIMENTAL
	...
and determine which of those should have the dependency on
"EXPERIMENTAL" removed.  no, don't go adding "(EXPERIMENTAL)" to the
prompt -- just deal with *only* those for which the dependency is
clearly out of date and not relevant anymore, and delete it.
that would be, at least, a place to start.  and, yes, there's piles of
potential (net/ipv4/Kconfig):
config TCP_CONG_HSTCP
        tristate "High Speed TCP"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	...
config TCP_CONG_HYBLA
        tristate "TCP-Hybla congestion control algorithm"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	...
config TCP_CONG_VEGAS
        tristate "TCP Vegas"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	...
... etc etc ...
