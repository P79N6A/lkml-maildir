Not sure why that would be a problem though:  whoever sleep first will
be woken up first.

Before I challenge that semantics, I want to mention that in current
implementation, dribbling AIO events will be distributed in round robin
fashion to all pending tasks waiting in io_getevents.  In the example you
gave earlier, task with min_nr of 2 will be woken up after 4 completed
events.  I consider that as an undesirable behavior as well.
Going back to your counter argument, why do we need the lowest min_nr in
the head of the queue?  These are tasks that shares one aio ctx and ioctx
is shareable only among threads.  Any reason why round robin policy is
superior than FIFO?  Also presumably, threads that shares ioctx should be
capable of handling events for the same ioctx.
From wakeup order point of view, yes, tasks with lowest min_nr wakes up
first, but looking from io completion order, they are not. And these are
the source of excessive ctx switch.
