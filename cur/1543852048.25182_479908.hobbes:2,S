I'm willing to either revert everyting to pre-inode-diet behavior, or leave it 
at the (newly re-proposed) page size default and let the other fs maintainers 
sort it out for their own codebase, but I don't pretend to know what is best 
for, say, qnx4 etc...  I'd be willing to cc: all maintainers asking them to take 
another long hard look at their code. :)
As we saw with cifs, these changes can have unintended consequences (not picking 
on cifs, it's just one that ran into issues with the broad-stroke change).
