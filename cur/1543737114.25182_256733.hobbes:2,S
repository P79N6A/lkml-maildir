What would this file look like ? a bunch of platform #ifdef's with
different implementations each time ?

Eventually...
In the meantime, that patch would fix urgent problems for ppc now so
I'd appreciate if Russell would consider it for inclusion asap. This
is the kind of subject on which everybody comes up with a different
"better" way to do it and no code, and nothign ever gets implemented
and we end up with no progress...
