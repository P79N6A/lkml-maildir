there's one more use case (don't know how much it's relevant but still
worth mentioning): pbbuttonsd v/s synaptics (x driver).
pbbuttonsd is a nice utility that (between the other things) monitors
keyboard and mouse activity and eventually sends the laptop to sleep.
The synaptics driver uses EVIOCGRAB and they don't work nice together
(eg: laptop goes to sleep even if actively using your touchpad)...
Now, with your proposal a user not using the synaptics driver and would
lose multiplexing to /dev/input/mice.
So why not just make EVIOCGRAB mean "don't send events to
mousedev but still report data to others opening the device"?
