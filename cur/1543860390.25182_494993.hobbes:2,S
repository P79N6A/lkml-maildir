I suspect it would be insane to move any part of JBD (apart from the
ordered-data flush) to use pagecache.  The whole thing is fundamentally
block-based.  But only for metadata - there's no strong reason why ext3/4
needs to manipulate file data via buffer_heads if data=journal and chattr
+j aren't in use.
We could possibly move ext3/4 directories out of the blockdev pagecache and
into per-directory pagecache, but that wouldn't change anything - the
journalling would still be block-based.
Adam Richter spent considerable time a few years ago trying to make the
mpage code go direct-to-BIO in all cases and we eventually gave up.  The
conceptual layering of page<->blocks<->bio is pretty clean, and it is hard
and ugly to fully optimise away the "block" bit in the middle.
buffer_heads become more important with large PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.  I'd expect
nobh mode to be quite inefficient with some workloads on 64k pages.  We
need that representation of the state (and location) of the block-sized
hunks which make up the page.

We'll see.
