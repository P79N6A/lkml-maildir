Obviously you mean one type of backend here.
I have tried to simplify this patch as much as possible so that it only tries to do one thing
and that is just the api change. I think the searching for valid bridges is a separate issue
since none of the currently supported hardware needs it. The only possible platform
that I assumed might is amd64 and Andi Kleen specifically told me it doesn't.

I don't agree that you *must* pass the agp_bridge_data pointer for every method.
You don't need it for bind/unbind/free if you associate each memory region
allocated using agp_allocate_memory(bridge,...) with a particular bridge 
which is what the patch does. That is, agp_memory knows which bridge it belongs to.
