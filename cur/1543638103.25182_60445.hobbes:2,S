Having code this readable is pretty much essential for
maintenance, too.
I wouldn't mind if every time I code or patch something
that isn't up to the reading standard of Mr. Magallon's
code somebody would raise his hand and/or LART me, until
the code is easily readable.
While developing the rmap VM we went through this process
for a number of iterations and the end result has been that
various people I've never heard of before managed to create
patches against the rmap code or ports of the rmap code to
2.5 that Just Worked.

Rik
