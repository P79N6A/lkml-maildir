But it does go away if I change from amarok to xmms, so amarok is
probably just not buffering quite enough.  OTOH, xmms seems to be picky
in other respects.  During heavy disk IO, it'll gripe about my soundcard
not being ready while switching songs, retry by poking the play button,
and all is fine.  Hohum.
Anyway, seems I can't reproduce the really bad stuff here, so no can
tinker with.
