Greetings,
I have followed the instructions given in Documentation/initrd.txt with regard to pivot_root, but am unable to unmount the filesystem, when everything is called from a non-interactive script. 
ie. When I set a link from linuxrc to /bin/ash and then manually go through the commands in the shell script, I am able to unmount the old initrd filesystem.  However, when linuxrc is a shell script containing the same commands, I am unable to umount the old initrd fs.  I get instead: "Device or resource busy".
The contents of my linuxrc script are as follows:
--------------------
#!/bin/ash
export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
 
cd /
mkdir /new
mount -t shm /dev/shm /new
cp -pdR * new
 
cd new
pivot_root . initrd
 
cd /
exec chroot . /bin/ash <dev/console > dev/console 2>&1
-------------
ash is a static binary.  chroot, mount and pivot_root are from busybox.
