Whilst always lurking here, I have nonetheless found your summaries useful and 
enjoyable, often highlighting important stuff I had completely missed or not 
understood.
Will you still be doing "Zacks Kernel News" in a certain linux mag? Always the 
most important section ;)
Best luck with whatever occupies your time now.
