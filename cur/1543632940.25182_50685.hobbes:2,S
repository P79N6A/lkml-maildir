So, you're worried that the realtime processing is going to suck
performance?  Don't worry about that.  Really.  Take a look at how
Adeos works and add up the cycles consumed by the whole thing.  It's
insignificant.
Just handling the timer interrupt with an iret consumes more cycles by
far than all the interrupt pipeline overhead.  You're imagining
inefficiency where there is none.

It's definitely better to be skipless, now we want to have our cake
and eat it too.  We can.
