Does ipmi_si not have a "owner"?  Ah, that makes sense, not all modules
do...

Subject: modules: fix reference counting logic for drivers without module pointers.
We weren't dropping the sysfs link for the module driver name if we
didn't happen to have the "owner" pointer in the driver.
Based on a patch from Mike Galbraith <efault@gmx.de>
