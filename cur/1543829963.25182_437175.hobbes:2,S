It's _not_ swappable memory, sadly. It's swappable before it hits 
linux_binprm, and it's swappable after it's mapped into the destination, 
but it is _not_ swappable while it's held in the bprm->page[] array ;/
I totally re-organized how execve() allocates the new mm at an execve 
several years ago (it used to re-use the old MM if it could), and that was 
so that we count just remove the brpm->page array, and just install the 
pages directly into the destination.
That was in 2002. I never actually got around to doing it ;(.
