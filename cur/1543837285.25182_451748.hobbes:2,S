Why do we need to use ->group_leader? All threads should have the same
->real_parent.
Why do we need tasklist_lock? I think rcu_read_lock() is enough.
In other words, do you see any problems with this code
	smlinkage long sys_getppid(void)
	{
		int pid;
		rcu_read_lock();
		pid = rcu_dereference(current->real_parent)->tgid;
		rcu_read_unlock();
		return pid;
	}
? Yes, we may read a stale value for ->real_parent, but the memory
can't be freed while we are under rcu_read_lock(). And in this case
the returned value is ok because the task could be reparented just
after return anyway.
Oleg.
