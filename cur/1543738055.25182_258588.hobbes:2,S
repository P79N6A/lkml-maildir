I just checked a "nm -n vmlinux" output on a x86 2.6.9-rc3-mm2 defconfig 
kernel and it has stuff like:
...
c01aed13 t .text.lock.transaction
c01b1db3 t .text.lock.checkpoint
...
c03c7708 r single_rates.0
c03c7714 r double_rate_channels.1
...
c0482280 d get_s16_labels.0
c04822c0 d put_s16_labels.1
c0482300 d get_s16_labels.2
c0482340 d put_s16_labels.3
...
c053d780 b nulldevname.1
c053d800 b bootstrap.2
...
Most of these seem like useful information (although I personally don't 
have any use for them).
The 'b' and 'r' types only get in if CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is specified.
There were 572 "__func__.*" symbols all with type 'r'. If we take into 
account that there were a total of 32881 symbols, these 572 are not that 
many. Even more, with the new compression scheme they would probably 
take only about 3 bytes per symbol to store the name and 4 bytes for the 
address (8 on 64 bit architectures) that would require about 4kb of data 
  for users that choose the CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL option. Removing the 
"__func__" symbols would represent less than a 2% decrease in size.
So maybe we could use "[A-Za-z0-9_\.]+" ?
