Fine. :-)

Right, but 32 byte PCI cacheline is fine for those. It's perfectly ok
for the PCI cacheline size to be multiple of the CPU one, but not vice
versa. Actually, we could use 128 for all x86s (to respect P4), but
it would be an obvious overkill.

Don't know. The cpuinfo_x86 is per-CPU thing, while pci_cache_line_size
is definitely system-wide.

Hmm, we treat each function as an independent PCI device, as per PCI
spec. Sharing the config space between functions sounds like a severe
hardware bug. Do you have any examples?

Well, in 2.4 on Alpha and ARM we still have pdev_enable_device() thing
which is the mostly __init-only variant of the pci_enable_device(),
but it also forces correct cacheline size and reasonable (more or less)
latency timer for *all* devices. Nobody had problems with it over the last
2 years, so I believe that setting cacheline size in pci_enable_device()
rather than in pci_set_master() is the right thing (and agrees with the
spec better).
