Thanks.
SCHED_ISO
/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu . . .: 70
/proc/sys/kernel/iso_period . : 5
XRUN Count  . . . . . . . . . :   110
vs
SCHED_FIFO
XRUN Count  . . . . . . . . . :   114
XRUN Count  . . . . . . . . . :   187
vs
SCHED_RR
XRUN Count  . . . . . . . . . :     0
XRUN Count  . . . . . . . . . :     0
Something funny going on here... You had more xruns with SCHED_FIFO than 
the default SCHED_ISO settings, and had none with SCHED_RR. Even in the 
absence of the SCHED_ISO results, the other results dont make a lot of 
sense.

P.S. If you're running on SMP it may be worth booting on UP or using cpu 
affinity (schedtool -a 0x1 will bind you to 1st cpu only) and see what 
effect that is having. There are some interesting things that can 
adversely affect latency on SMP.
