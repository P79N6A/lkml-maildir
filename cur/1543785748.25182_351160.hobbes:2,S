Are we sure?  Yeah, SuSE has shipped that code "enabled" for a while,
but I'm still not comfortable making that the default.
Only if we merge the code that does the handoff, with the same code that
does it in the usb core, would I feel more comfortable to enable this
always.  I had a patch from David Brownell to do this, but it had some
link errors at times, so I had to drop it :(
