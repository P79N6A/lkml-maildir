Please update as follows:
1) Provide a detailed explanation as to /why/ this is needed.  I 
certainly encourage use of ahci over legacy mode, but the patch 
description tells us nothing.
2) Combine the two patches into one.  Think of a patch as an atomic 
operation.  If you apply your patches as submitted, then a 'git bisect' 
may reach a state where the PCI IDs exist in _neither_ sata_nv or ahci. 
  Any time you /move/ code or data, it should be in the same patch.
3) Your patches are completely unreviewable in a standard Internet 
mailer, because they were sent with your email base64-encoded.  For many 
mailers, base64 encoding means the patch is not shown nor able to be 
commented upon.  Indeed, some mailers make it difficult to response -at 
all- to data contained in a MIME attachment.
The change itself seems OK, once suitable justification is provided.
	Jeff
