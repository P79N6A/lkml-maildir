poll()'s timeout value is measrued in milliseconds.  Using a 32bit
value, as implied by using 'int' for the type, limits the mximum timeout
to be 2^31-1 milliseconds, which means about 24 days.  Believe it or
not, people are complaining about this.  Changing the timeout to a 64
bit millisecond timeout would lift the limitation from the API's POV.  I
don't know what limitations exist in the kernel itself.
