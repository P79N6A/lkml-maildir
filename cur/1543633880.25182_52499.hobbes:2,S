Irk, this is ugly. But how you are moving away from the initial goal (or
maybe this was your goal the whole time, just a single merge hint?) of
passing back the hint instead of maintaing it in the queue. So let me
ask, are you aware of the last_merge I/O scheduler hint? Which does
exactly this already...
