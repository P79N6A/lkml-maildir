Many.
- you don't need both size and len, just the length
- you don't need a count of what's in the fifo, calc from tail-head
- you don't need remaining, when the tail reaches the head
   you're out of data.
- you want to do at most two memcpy operations, the loop is just
   unproductive overhead.
- if the fifo goes empty set the head and tail back to zero so you don't
   wrap (assumes doing just two memcpy ops) when you don't need to
