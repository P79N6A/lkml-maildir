Hi,
I've wrote a driver for the ISDN active card TurboPAM made
by Auvertech:
	
http://www.auvertech.fr
This is a card targeted at ISPs / access providers, supporting
up to 30 B-channel connections simultaneously.
The patch is available against Linux 2.4.5 and 2.2.19.
Since it is rather big, I won't post it here but just give the URL:
http://download.alcove-labs.org/software/tpam/tpam-2.4.5.patch.bz2
and
http://download.alcove-labs.org/software/tpam/tpam-2.2.19.patch.bz2
Please apply.
Thanks,
Stelian.
