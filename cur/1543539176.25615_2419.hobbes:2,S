I'm trying to get a working version of the ttysnoop program
running under a 2.2.x kernel on a RedHat 6.x system.
This program sets up a pty master/slave but I don't think it
understands the pts/? notation in 2.2.
Can anyone help me out with this, and/or point me to useful
docs/manpages so I can RTFM?
TIA
TTYL
