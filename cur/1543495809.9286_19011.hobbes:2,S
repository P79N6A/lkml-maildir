I don't know if this should be a bug or not, but when I run kmail and try to
compact my linux-kernel folder (about 98MB), it begins to use all available
memory and swap (128MB+128MB), and the machine appears to crash.  The kernel
still responds to pings, and I can connect to the telnet port, but no prompt
ever comes up, and I can't even move the mouse in X.
Nothing ever appears in the logs, and I have to hard reset.  It is completely
reproducible.  Is this a kernel bug, or should I just set reasonable ulimits?
