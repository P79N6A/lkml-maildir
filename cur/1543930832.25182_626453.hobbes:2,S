FWIW, the one thing slub does that slab doesn't that I find really nice
is being enable to enable debugging at boot time rather than compile time.
We don't get many people running benchmarks against the Fedora kernel,
so any scalability differences between slub/slab probably won't reach us
until we start shipping betas of the next RHEL based on the same kernel.
Which leaves my only other gripe.  It broke slabtop.
There's an alternative implementation in Documentation/vm/slabinfo.c
(why there not say, util-linux, home of current slabtop?)
