In their git trees, people usually have a branch called "for-linus" for
fixes to the current tree and "for-next" or "for-akpm" (or "devel" or
"testing") for stuff for the next release).

In linux-next, when the choice is left to me I name the trees like this:
xxx-current	bug fixes and stuff not take yet for Linus' current tree
xxx		stuff for the next release.
Today I have used your names, but Adrian is correct that they are
inconsistent with (at least) my normal usage.
One question: is the driver in ldp.next intended for 2.6.26? Because if
it is, ldp.next should be based on usb.next, not usb. If not then
ldp.next is wrongly named.
