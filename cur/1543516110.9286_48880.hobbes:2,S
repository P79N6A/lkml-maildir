That would entail keeping min_nice as part of process state.  And you
need to add an interface to change min_nice (with the same restrictions
as current nice value, that is, need CAP_SYS_NICE to decrease value),
and you need to work out what happens with a setuid-root execpv(), and
you need to work out what happens after set*uid() calls, and you may
need to worry about breaking old software that doesn't know about the
nice-min interface and assumes that if it does "fork(); nice();
execl()" the child will not be able to un-nice itself.
Roll up a patch; I'm sure someone could find it useful.
