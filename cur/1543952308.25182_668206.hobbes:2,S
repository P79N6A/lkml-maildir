Not if it is mirrored and replicated.  Also nice if crashes are very
rare, which they are unless you work at it.

I say it does not crash often, to the point where I have not seen it
crash once for any reason I did not create myself (I tend to wait for
the occasional brown bag release to fade away before shifting development  We do get quite a few
reports of less mature systems like hald and usb causing problems, and
not too long ago NFS client was very crash happy.  I did see some of
those myself two years ago, and fixed them.
On the whole, Linux is very reliable.  Very very reliable.  Now mirror
that, replicate it, add in 2 x 2 redundant power supplies backed by
independent UPS units so you can do regular preemptive maintenance on
the batteries, and you have a sweet enterprise transaction processing
system.  All set for a faster than light moon shot :-)
