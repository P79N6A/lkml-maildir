Will come tomorrow - I don't sit right at the machine, and while trying 
to figure out what happens, I accidentally shut it down or caused it to 
crash (I can't log in remotely ATM).

Yes, that's sort of what's happening. /proc/interrupts shows that all 
CPUs overall get an even share of IRQ 0 - but each IRQ0 is processed by 
just one CPU. How can I examine and set the interrupt routing?
