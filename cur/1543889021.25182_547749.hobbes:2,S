I don't read the sentence you quoted as snotty at all ..  I had no idea
where the changes came from, and I was simply asking that.. Since there
isn't a history for the -rt patch, I honestly don't know where some of
the code comes from ..
Since I had no idea that Thomas wrote that code, there's no premeditated
aggravation, or flame bait there..

I don't see that as me asking a favor.. If a patch crosses LKML and I
ask "Why does this hunk exist?" that's not a favor. That is pure code
review, which is exactly what I was doing in this thread. Which is
reviewing code and asking questions..
I hope you don't read my comments above as snotty cause it's not suppose
to be, just conversation..
