I don't follow 2.5 dev (yet). I merely follow Andre's work on 2.4 and 
code a new chipset capabilities detection code in order to support newer 
 chipsets.
Is the v0.13 driver driver already forward ported to 2.5 by somebody ?
If there's a need (some 2.5 developpers needing a more uptodate driver 
and uncomfortable with forward porting IDE chipset drivers), I'll do it...

Unless the SiS620 is not compatable with the 630 IDE support spec or 
affected by some bugs I corrected for PIO mode timings (unlikely as they 
were unnoticed for a quiet long time) since sis5513.c v0.11 this should 
not be an IDE chipset problem.

Hum, 486 SiS chipsets might bring pain to me also...
I've received several bugreports for old SiS IDE chipset (ie pre ATA66) 
that I couldn't solve without disabling the SiS driver or passing 
"ide=nodma". I've triple-checked the specs and couldn't see the problem.
