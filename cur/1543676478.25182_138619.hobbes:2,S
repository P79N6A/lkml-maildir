Subject: [PATCH] hugetlbfs: fix error reporting in case of invalid mount options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
there is not much point in trying to print the mount options after
hugetlbfs_parse_options() went over them.
Since it employs strsep(), it cuts the option string into pieces by
replacing all commas with NUL characters. A following printk() will
always show the first option, only, which could be confusing.
The patch below changes hugetlbfs to not try to echo the string of
mount options in case of an error at all. It wouldn't tell us anything
we didn't know before, anyway.
René
