We've thought of making a readonly CVS pserver interface to BK which would
at least make it easy to get the source in some form that the GPL folks
like.  Somebody else should be able to do that with a perl script.  You
could attempt a read/write interface as well, that's a lot harder, the
impedance mismatch between BK and CVS becomes much more apparent in
the read/write case.
