yes, that is perfectly true, and sorry if we gave you the wrong
impression.
the goal of these patches is to do a semaphore->completion conversion in
cases where the semaphore was used for completion purposes. It's a bit
faster and more readable but not a 'bugfix' in any way. (another set of
patches are converting sleep_on() uses to wait_event*() plus waitqueues
- those can in fact be considered bugfixes in some cases.)
typically the cases where semaphores are held by one task and released
by another task happens coincide with this used-for-completion scenario.
[ the different-owner assert that triggers in my PREEMPT_REALTIME tree
is for completely different reasons and has no impact on upstream at
all. (It merely means 'Ingo does some weird stuff again, pester him, not
others'.) ]
