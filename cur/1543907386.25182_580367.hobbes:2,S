It's straightforward engineering math:  the more LOC that changed, the 
more important it is to /not/ stuff it into a stabilization release, 
because of the greater potential for breaking stuff and negating all the 
existing testing so far.
Once -rc1 is out there, that means the focus should be on stabilizing 
the existing codebase.  Pushing a big driver update means that effort 
must restart from scratch.  We just don't want to go down that road, 
which a big reason for the merge window in general.
If you miss the merge window, tough cookies :)  You gotta deal with it 
just like I do, and everyone else does.
Remember -- the more disciplined we all are with the merge window, the 
more likely it is that a release can be stabilized quickly, and thus, 
the more quickly we will reach the next merge window.
In contrast, increasing violations of the merge window mean increasing 
time between releases.
