yes, since a Pentium supports a superset of the 486 gcc can't optimize 
for a 486 in a way that the code won't run on a Pentium.

The only reason why I sent the patch to make the AMD Elan a separate 
subarch was the CLOCK_TICK_RATE #ifdef in include/asm-i386/timex.h .
It should be possible to change it to a variable (as with 
CONFIG_X86_PC9800) if both the Elan and a different cpu are supported if 
this is really a required use.
If this is the solution you prefer, how would you do runtime detection 
for the AMD Elan?
