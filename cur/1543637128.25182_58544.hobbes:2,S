I would vote for ordering.  The slab init code was changed to initialize 
new fields...   Allocating memory for slabs is another story.  They depend on
the lru lists and the pagemap_lru_lock being setup...   Has this happened 
when slab storage is initialized?  If not a call to do this in the slab init logic 
would fix things.  It could also be fixed using this fragment (slab.c):
+       /*
+        * We want the pagemap_lru_lock, in UP spin locks to not
+        * protect us in interrupt context...  In SMP they do but,
+        * optimizating for speed, we process if we do not get it.
+        */
+       if (!(cachep->flags & SLAB_NO_REAP)) {
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+               locked = spin_trylock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
+#else
+               locked = !in_interrupt() && spin_trylock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
+#endif
+               if (!locked && !in_interrupt())
+                       goto opps1;
If there is some way to verify that the pagemap_lru_lock is ready.  Note its
fine to just set locked to 0 and proceed - as long as this condition does not
last forever.  Also this code is in a fastpath so efficient is good...
Thoughts?
