Ok Jiri. Just to note - last time I submitted a single patch like this
("fix use of loose" in April 2008) to trivial@, the patch frequently
failed to merge due to some of the files being modified, renamed
etc in the meantime, and the patch got dropped. When I split it into
one patch per file and sent them to subsystem maintainers, about 90%
of the patches were merged.
So my impression is that multiple single file patches are more
successful. It should be easier for you to drop any patches which
fail to merge due to other work. But if you think a single patch
is best, I'll submit a single patch.
Nick.
