I assumed that was why all the "timestamp correction on changing CPU" 
code was added recently.

Yes.  Or, if the accuracy is sufficient, you could just use 
timestamp_last_tick to set timestamp which would save the cost of 
calling sched_clock() for that purpose.

I agree which is why I didn't chase it.  As far as I'm concerned when 
sched_clock() appears to go backwards the time interval that I'm 
measuring is so small that using zero is close enough.

When I suspected it as the source of a problem that I was experiencing I 
put some test code in to detect it.  The time between occurrences was of 
the order of hours and only happened when the interval was very small.
As I said, I assumed that it was due to "corrections" but didn't bother 
chasing it as it only happened when the time intervals were very small 
and using zero when it occurred was adequate for my purposes.
