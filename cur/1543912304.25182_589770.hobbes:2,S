BSD code can definitely be brought into a GPL project as you describe.
The problem is the other direction.
Aren't patches made against the kernel GPL'd if the author doesn't
explicitly grant them more liberal BSD license in addition?
The problem then comes in taking the patches that were only made
available against GPL code and reshipping them under the BSD license
without the author explicitly agreeing to this.
What if a patch spans both code that is pure GPL and code imported
from BSD, how do you license it?
