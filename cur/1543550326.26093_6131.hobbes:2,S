It has been said that at least one version of Slackware has the 'which
reports errors to stdout' bug.  So I think we need to return to an ugly
yet robust version.
Note that this patch also uses ':=' instead of '='.  The latter has the
unpleasant effect of evaluating the shell expression every time $(CC)
is referenced, whereas the former just assigns it a fixed value once.
To be honest, the whole series of variables should use ':=', but it
doesn't really matter for the others.
