Yes.

I have to admit that "devspec" doesn't seem to do much for me, but I don't 
think we should call it "firmware", since that would (to me) be more about 
the firmware of the _device_ rather than the platform.
Maybe just "platform-data" or something. But if "devspec" has magic 
meaning on a Mac, and since this would be inherently platform-specific 
_anyway_, I don't actually see any reason to not use "devspec".
On some platforms, we might have multiple different entries (eg on a PC we 
might have pointers to ACPI data, to PnP data and to EFI data, all at the 
same time. I hope we never will, but maybe there would be reason for it). 
That would argue _against_ a "generic" name like "platform", and for 
something that is actually very much specific to the kind of data it 
points to (eg "of-data" rather than "platform-data").
End result: I don't think we much care about the name. Whatever makes you
happy. As long as the source code is clean and something like
"pcibios_add_platform_entries()" at least makes that come true.
