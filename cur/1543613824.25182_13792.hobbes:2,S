What about a CONFIG_8WAY which, if set, activates a scheduler that
performs better on such nontypical machines? I see and understand
boths sides arguments yet I fail to see where the real problem is
with having a scheduler that just kicks in _iff_ we're running the
kernel on a nontypical kind of machine.
This would keep the straigtforward scheduler Linus is defending
for the single processor machines while providing more performance
to heavy SMP machines by having a more complex scheduler better suited
for this task.
