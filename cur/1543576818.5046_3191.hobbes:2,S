gcc 2.95.2 md.texi sais:
@cindex @samp{g} in constraint
@item @samp{g}
Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
registers that are not general registers.
(2.95.2 was chosen to make it clear it is not something new in gcc).
That means gcc is really free to choose which of register, memory or
immediate it puts in and the fact that some gcc version choose one and
others choose other is perfectly correct.
Fix the constraints and be happy (at least during the upcoming millenium) :)
