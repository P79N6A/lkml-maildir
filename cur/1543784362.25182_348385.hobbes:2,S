I am not able to boot the 2.6.13 version of the kernel. I've tried different systems, tried downloading again, still nothing. Here's the last thing I see from the serial port:
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: ... autorun DONE.
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).
logips2pp: Detected unknown logitech mouse model 1

The console shows the reiserfs module loaded and then the message
waiting for /dev/sda2 to appear
It then dumps a list of devices and sda is not one of them. I've attached the entire boot log if any one is interested.
I've tried statically linking cciss on another system and the same basic results. Apparently, MPT cannot be statically linked unless I missed something.
What do I have to do to get 2.6.13 to boot up?
Thanks,
