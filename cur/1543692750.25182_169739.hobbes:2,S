Beats me.  As far as I can see, all updates to it were 3rd-party.  It's
either abandoned, or never required specific patches too badly (also
quite possible in this case).
It went into the tree in 2.3.2 and from there to 2.6.0-test6 I see nothing
that would look like maintainer's update.  OTOH, it's read-only and shouldn't
be too badly broken (or hard to keep alive).
Outside of trunk (i.e. in 2.4.16--) we have a backport of global 2.5 change
(sb_bread()) and check for set_blocksize() failures (from Alan).  BTW, the
latter patch is missing in 2.5.  Its equivalent would be
