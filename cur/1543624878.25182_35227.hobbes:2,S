Well, I tried this, but it just gave me a slew of initial rename conflicts.  
It could be something to do with the fact that my base development is still on 
2.4.18 (so the ancestors are easier to manage).
I finally solved it by writing a script to backport a bitkeeper change set to 
an earlier ancestor while preserving the change logs.  This is going to be 
helpful taking change sets between 2.4 and 2.5 anyway.
Thanks,
James
