Yes but then you do not have an accurate count of MLOCKed pages. We will 
only have that count after reclaim has run and removed the pages from the 
LRU. That could take some time (or may never happen the way some people 
handle memory around here).

I see... Okay that could be simple to address.

The other issue that the patch should address is to allow the VM to have 
statistics that show the actual amount of MLOCKed pages. With the pure 
scanner based approach this would no longer work.
