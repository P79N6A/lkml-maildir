Well, it's certainly not the first patch of this kind to
make it into the USB config file (see input core), so if a
precedant was set, it wasn't by this patch. Do we need to do
this for every dependency ? I don't know, IMHO only for the
non obvious ones (and anyway, that's just a bit of
documentation, what's wrong with having more doc ?)
And the dependency between USB Mass Storage and SCSI support
is more than sufficiently obscure for the end-user to
justify this one. Comme on, who -- appart from the driver
developpers -- would think of it at once by itself ? I do
know I spent almost more time searching for the Mass Storage
driver option than writing/testing this patch, since I've
got a SCSI-less system.
Knowing that something requires VIDEO or SOUND, on the other
hand, do not requires deep knowledge of the driver sources.
