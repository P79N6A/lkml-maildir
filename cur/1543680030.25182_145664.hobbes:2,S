What this boils down to is, "there may not be enough space".
Personally I prefer incrementally resizing LVM partitions for conversion 
anyway, but I'll take a stab at this.
Simple solution: In your conversion routines, allocate a chunk of another 
filesystem (just another file), and use that for scratch space. Journalling 
and the like won't get much harder, so why not?
And you can easily expand the file if you need to.
Problem: You might wind up with a 99%-converted filesystem and not have enough 
space to do without the scratch file. This could be bad.
If you can mount the filesystem as-is, then simply deleting a few large files 
would allow the conversion to complete. Otherwise you'll have to resize the 
underlying partition and the partial FS - difficult, but doable.
I'm think this idea ranks under "cool, but difficult and not quite necessary". 
Union mounts coupled with LVM and online resizing (which both Reiser3.6 and 
Reiser4 support, I presume) would render it irrelevant anyway; even without 
them, it can still be done with just LVM if taking the filesystem offline for 
a few hours is okay.
And if it isn't then you can likely afford some backup tape.
