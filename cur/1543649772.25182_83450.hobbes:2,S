Dual Athlon XP 1800+ on ASUS A7M266-D (760MPX), 512 MB of PC2100 in two identical banks.
I observed a noticeable slowdown several minutes later (after typing this mail),
see below.

=> it seems that the memory areas have changed and that it is a bit
slower now. But as you can see, no_prefetch is stable. Only "common"
functions get slower.
So I tried to allocate hundreds of MB of RAM to swap a bit, then free it.
The results look better again :

=> "common" implementations seem to really suffer from physical location.
