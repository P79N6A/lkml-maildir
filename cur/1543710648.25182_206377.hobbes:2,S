I'd be inclined to leave that as-is actually.  I'll run with Chris's patch
temporarily, but we need a real unplug function for swapper_space.  Which
will leave default_backing_dev_info unique.
I'll do swap_unplug_io_fn().  swap implements a poor-man's raid0.  What are
the locking rules for the unplug function btw?  It can sleep, yes?
