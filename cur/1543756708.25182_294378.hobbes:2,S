Its clear that there are all sorts of issues 
with process accounting and other race conditions
associated with running the timer in a thread.
The timer IRQ does have a noticable impact 
especially on the slower CPUS. In this domain,
precise process time accounting may not be 
all that important, as long as the scheduler
does not get confused, and that lone NODELAY
IRQ doesn't get delayed (as much).
It would be nice if some of the process 
accounting could be pipelined or deferred,
but I don't have those answers right now.
