Sounds like there is a two directory entries with the same name in the
same directory.  This can cuase severe confusion since the kernel
assumes that this will never happen.  Depending on which one gets
found first, and what is cached in the dentry cache, you'll get one
inode or the other.
E2fsck doesn't normally notice these sorts of inconsistencies, since
it takes too much time and memory to look for duplicate entries.  If
you optimize directories using "e2fsck -fD", it will find and offer to
rename directory entires with a duplicated name.
If you notice the problem, you can also go in directly with debugfs
and rename the errant directory entry directly.
