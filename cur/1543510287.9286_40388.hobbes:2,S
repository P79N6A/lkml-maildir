Note that the equivalent of O_NONE has been around on Linux since '92 or
so (numeric value 3, I usually call it O_NOACCESS). It is required for
things like fdformat and setfdprm. LILO also uses it. So the "main code
path" already supports this. Drivers looking at f_mode or f_flags may be
a different story, though.
