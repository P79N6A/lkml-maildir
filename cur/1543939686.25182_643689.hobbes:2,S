Subject: [PATCH] remove duplicating priority setting in try_to_free_p
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/32

shrink_zones in try_to_free_pages already set zone through
note_zone_scanning_priority.
So, setting prev_priority in try_to_free_pages is needless.
This patch is made by 2.6.24-rc8.
