The Linux XFS development list had a discussion about it a few weeks 
ago. I even think someone from 3ware joined in or if someone had a quote 
from someone at 3ware. But just go there and you'll see the site has 
changed. The only graphic on the front page is now their IP storage 
thing. The Palisade.
Go to Products on their page. Notice the lack of information on the 
Escalades.
http://www.3ware.com
, but I think you got that already.
Only info on Escalades is:
" Inquires regarding Escalade Storage Switch products should be directed 
to 650.327.8600 or info@3ware.com."
and a picture...
