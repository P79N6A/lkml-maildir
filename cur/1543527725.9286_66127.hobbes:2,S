more to the point, it happened twice. 
	once when I was running 2.3.41 smp
	it was mozilla's (m13?) fault that it ate whole ram,
	it killed X only.
	the other time it happened was today
	it was kernel 2.3.47 smp
	it was netscape when I as testing s "stress" page
		(
http://www.wam.umd.edu/~soref/stress.html
)
	it killed sendmail,emacs and klogd few times..
the box has 128mb ram and 128mb swap.
any idea what's going on?
