Subject: [PATCH 07/11] NFSD: Use "depends on" for PROC_FS dependency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Recently a reverse dependency was added to fs/Kconfig to ensure that
PROC_FS was enabled if NFSD_V4 was enabled.
There is a guideline in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt that
states "In general use select only for non-visible symbols (no prompts
anywhere) and for symbols with no dependencies."
A quick grep around other Kconfig files reveals that no entry currently
uses "select PROC_FS" -- every one uses "depends on".  Thus CONFIG_NFSD_V4
should use "depends on PROC_FS" as well.
For SUNRPC_GSS, it's a little more complex.  Other entries can "select"
SUNRPC_GSS, as it is non-visible.  However, the guideline suggests an
entry can't "select" it if it has a dependency (such as PROC_FS).
So, we add forward dependencies on PROC_FS to RPCSEC_GSS_FOO instead.
XXX: Both CONFIG_NFSV4 and CONFIG_NFSD_V4 select RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5, which is
visible, which kconfig-language.txt also frowns upon.  The intent was to
enable at least one GSS mechanism if V4 was enabled.  Perhaps we should
make SUNRPC_GSS visible, and make the NFSv4 options visible only if
SUNRPC_GSS is enabled.
