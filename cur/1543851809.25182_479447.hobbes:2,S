The requirement by the vast majority of conferences is that it must
not have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference, and
you most not simultaneously have the paper under consideration by more
than one peer-reviewed journal or conference.  In general, though, you
can publish work on a web page, mailing list, or even as an
un-reviewed Techncial Report published by your department, without
harming your chances of submission to a peer-reviewed
conference/journal.  Check with the program committee of the
conference to be sure, but that's way it general works.
