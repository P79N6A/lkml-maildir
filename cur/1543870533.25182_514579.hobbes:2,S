Well, given that bi_end_io() is called after the "io" has completed, I'm
assuming that networking has completely finished with the memory by the
time bi_end_io() gets called.
I guess one can envisage situations where that might not happen, but they'd
be terribly buggy ones, surely.

OK.  So you're proposing that XFS and ext3 simply stop sing slab for this
memory?
