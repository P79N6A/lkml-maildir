got it!  Everything got changed to the new convention except that
the calculation of 'nr' just before the check "nr <= offset" .
I have generated this patch which takes care of that and hence fixes the
data loss problem as well. I guess it is cleaner too. 
This patch is generated w.r.t 2.6.8.1. If everybody blesses this patch I
will forward it to Andrew.
