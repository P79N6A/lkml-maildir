Did you try this one? You are seeing problems with preemption disabled,
but it's at least worth trying.

Subject: [PATCH]new_TSC_based_delay_tsc()
Cc: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

Hi all,
Please ignore the previous patch with the same subject.
It has a bug that can manifest itself in the very exotic case
when each do {} while() iteration executes on different cpu
leading to potentially infinite loop.
This is a patch based on the Ingo's idea/patch to track 
delay_tsc() migration to another cpu by comparing 
smp_processor_id(). It is against kernel-2.6.24-rc3.
What is different:
1. Using unsigned (instead of long) to unify for i386/x86_64.
2. Minimal preempt_disable/enable() critical sections
   (more room for preemption)
3. some statements have been rearranged, to account for
    possible under/overflow of left/TSC
Tested on both: 32/64 bit SMP PREEMPT kernel-2.6.24-rc3
Comments, please.
