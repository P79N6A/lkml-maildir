I'm running the stock Fedora Core 5 kernels, and for some reason the
stradis driver is loaded.  I suppose there's some magic in the FC5
hotplug scripts that tries to load all device drivers that claim to
support a certain PCI device.
I have blacklisted the stradis driver on my system, which fixes it for
me, but it does feels as a workaround for a problem that ought to be
fixed in the driver.  If the card doesn't have a subvendor/subdevice,
is there some way of doing a sanity check on the board to see if it
actually is a stradis card and then release the board if it isn't?
If the driver isn't fixed I'll file a bug report on the Fedora
bugzilla asking them to blacklist or just not compile that driver.
