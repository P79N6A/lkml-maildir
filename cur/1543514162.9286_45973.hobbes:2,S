This was a false alarm!
Check the 2.2.13 sources, folks; ISDN_MSNLEN is still safely at 20 in
linux/include/linux/isdn.h . There was some miscommunication that led to
this confusion.
You do NOT need to recompile the ISDN utilities as a result.
There was only some problem with ipppd not correctly handling -ac kernel
versions (which should have been a problem with whatever kernel version,
not just 2.2.13).
