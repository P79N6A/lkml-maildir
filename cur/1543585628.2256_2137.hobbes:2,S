Good find.
HOWEVER, the patch is not right.
You cannot get the kernel lock from within a spinlock, so you should
_replace_ the kernel lock with the spinlock (which is definitely the
correct thing to do anyway - the kernel lock is there exactly because we
didn't have any other good synchronization primitive, and that's _exactly_
what the spinlock in question is all about).
Also, you have to drop the spinlock over the actual page allocation inside
alloc_area_pte(). So I'd suggest something along the lines of the attached
(completely untested) patch.
