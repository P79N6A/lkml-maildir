Is it a race if noone cares?  :)
The code does
	if (!request_region(...))
		fail
	touch hardware
	release_region
	if (!request_region(...))
		fail
If the HIGHLY UNLIKELY event of another ISA driver claiming this region 
occurs, the system continues working just fine.
At the time, I was thinking that any further touching of the code should 
be converting it to a more pnp-like structure.
