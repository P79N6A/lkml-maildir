Subject: A "new driver model" and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL question

It dawned on me only now that a "new driver model" introduced
in patches from GKH export symbols like that:
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(class_create);
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(class_destroy);
and so on.  The problem is that corresponding old symbols, which
are still present in 2.6.12, were exported
EXPORT_SYMBOL(class_simple_create);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(class_simple_destroy);
....
This creates a problem.  There exist out-of-tree drivers which are
using those symbols and, even if sources are available, are not
licensed GPL for whatever reasons.  No, I am not the author of any
of those so I cannot do very much about re-licensing.  As an effect
a conversion to a "new driver model", even if simple, does not work.
In particular I bumped into that with Myrinet card drivers.
Was a decision to use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL deliberate and if yes then
what considerations dictated it, other then the patch author wrote
it that way, and what drivers in question are supposed to use when
this change will show up in the mainline?  It looks that 2.6.13
will do this.
  Thanks,
  Michal
