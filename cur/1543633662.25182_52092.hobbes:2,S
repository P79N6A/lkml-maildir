Well, you should go talk to Wine hackers one day. More is known about
.lnk files than you think.
The Windows kernel has nothing to do with them. If you want to
dereference .lnk files you have to call a regular user-space library,
more specifically the shell32.dll library. For more information, see the
IShellLink COM interface:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/ishelllink/ishelllink.asp
So .lnk files are handled 100% in userspace, just like .desktop files.
