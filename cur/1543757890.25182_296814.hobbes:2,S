Any chance to convince the alien who took control of Jeff's libata queue to
push:
r8169: synchronization and balancing when the device is closed
(1.1982.1.58 ?)
Test case on current 2.6.11-rc4:
- ifconfig ethX 10.0.0.1 up
- ifconfig ethX down
- ifconfig ethX 10.0.0.1 up
  -> Rx does not work any more
- ifconfig ethX down
  -> command hangs
