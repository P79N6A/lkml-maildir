Subject: [PATCH] Remove <asm/setup.h> from cmdlinepart.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Remove include of <asm/setup.h> from cmdlinepart.c.  This
is not be needed for i386 (it builds fine with this patch),
and ia64 doesn't supply a setup.h.
asm/setup.h contains a hodge-podge of stuff with no real
consistency between architectures.  It appears to be
included mainly by arch-specific drivers:
	acsi (Atari disks)
	amiflop (Amiga floppy)
	z2ram (ZorroII ram disk)
	amiserial (Amiga serial)
	...
and under arch-specific #ifdefs:
	fbcon (under __mc68000__ or CONFIG_APUS)
	fonts (ditto)
	logo (CONFIG_M68K)
	...
