Thanks for the summary, Andrew.
Guillaume (or anyone else tempted to do this) - it's a good idea, when
posting 100 lines of data, to summarize with a line or two of words, as
Andrew did here.  It is far more efficient for one writer to do this,
than each of a thousand readers.
Hmmm ... so why was exec slower?
