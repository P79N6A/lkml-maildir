The problem is not with enabling both b43 and bcm43xx (will, whis won't work
anyway, and there is no chance fixing it). The problem is with enabling the
bcm43xx wifi driver and the b44 Ethernet driver. The ethernet driver then
wrongly autosolects some config options that prevent the bcm43xx
driver from loading, so I'm left with either no wifi or no ethenet.
