On ARM, simply scanning the kernel stack for addresses in the kernels
text segment or a module text tends to (or at least used to) return a
large quantity of noise.  This makes reading the backtrace nearly
impossible - not only does it contain real function pointers and
return addresses, but also pointers to literal pools and the like.
