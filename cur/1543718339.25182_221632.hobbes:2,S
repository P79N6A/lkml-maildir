e.g. from ptrace, like Daniel said. I don't think it was from ptrace
in the case where I saw a report, but it shows that the WARN_ON is bogus.
If you really want to know what causes it you would need more debugging code
as Nick pointed out too. So, the WARN_ON in its current form
is known to trigger in a valid situation and not sufficient to find 
possible problems. I would remove it.
