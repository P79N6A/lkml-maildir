Yes (if you allow an HP i2000 Itanium system to be counted as an Intel
box, at least).
The display (which isn't mine, unfortunately), came with an Apple
proprietary connector -> DVI/USB convertor, which you'd definitely
need (it contains the power supply for the monitor, for example).
Beyond that, I think you just need a graphics card that can do the
desired resolution (I'm using an ASUS v9180 mx440 card).
I can't control the brightness, as that would apparently require some
Apple-specific USB driver (so much for USB device classes...).
Similarly, to turn off the monitor, I have to use "xset dpms force
off".  Other than that, the display works beautifully.  Love the real
estate it affords... ;-)
