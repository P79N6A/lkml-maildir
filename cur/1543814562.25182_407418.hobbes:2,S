I don't believe that.
If we have something we might want to unshare, that implies by definition 
that it was something we wanted to conditionally share in the first place.
IOW, it ends up being something that would be a clone() flag.
So I really do believe that there is a fundamental 1:1 between the flags. 
They aren't just "similar". They are very fundamentally about the same 
thing, and giving two different names to the same thing is CONFUSING.
