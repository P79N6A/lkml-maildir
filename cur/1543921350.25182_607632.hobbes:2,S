Between rc8-mm2 and 2.6.23-mm1, autofs stopped working in the
-mm kernel.
Instead of mounting my home directory, I get these messages in
/var/log/messages:
Oct 20 00:38:52 kenny automount[2293]: cache_readlock: mapent cache
rwlock lock failed
Oct 20 00:38:52 kenny automount[2293]: unexpected pthreads error: 11 at
65 in cache.c
I am not sure if this is due to autofs changes or changes in some other
code that was merged.  If you can think of any suspicious change that
I should test, please let me know.
