Hi Jeff,
I am Probir Chatterjee, an undergrad student expreimenting with upcoming
network technologies.
I saw some of your postings on google groups and thought that you might be
able to help.
I am working with 3 kinds of cards (intel pro/1000) and netgear - ga620t and
ga622t.
I wanted to know how to turn on checksum offloading in the liknux 2.4.x
kernel for these cards.
Is there anything else that i need to do apart from changing parameters in
linux kernel(modify the driver??) ?
It will be helpful if you can give a few pointers on how checksum offloading
can be enabled for the 3 cards.
Really appreciate your help.
Regards,
Probir.
