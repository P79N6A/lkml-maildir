Correct no drives shipped.
Maxtor failed to move forward in updating the device side TCQ.
I will have to look up my email record to give you who I was working with
and talking to about the issues.  I do know it was in the Longmont
division.
The last discussion I had with Maxtor releated in forcing the state
machine to default to bus release on execution of the command block.
This would fix the the gaping hole in the protocol.  The effects from this
single change were not fully white board material, and may have addressed
or covered the other two pitfalls.
Drop the ball, meaning it was started and then tabled.
Tabled because of SATA/SAS.
Comments?
