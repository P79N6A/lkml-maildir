Then I guess I messed up the ARM rmap.h for 2.5.
I knew it had to be different than the 2.4 one somehow and
was under the impression that you changed the pagetable
layout in 2.5 to have "4 kB page tables" with 2 kB hardware
and 2 kB software page tables in the same page.
The page->mm thing is a stupid, stupid typo.
I guess akpm didn't have an ARM machine for testing, either ;)
regards,
Rik
