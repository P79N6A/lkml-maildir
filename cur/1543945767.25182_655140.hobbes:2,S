Really? Unbelievable what these guys do to make my live harder...
So, they might use some undocumented GPIO to turn the power on, and
refuse that if they don't find the original card? Looks like I can't
have WLAN on an EeePC (I won't run a tainted kernel). Stupid thing to
sell a PC with Linux preinstalled but with hardware not supported in
mainline.
