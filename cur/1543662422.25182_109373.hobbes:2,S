What I just suggested would be a short 1 line note to lkml.  I know he's
very busy, but what's that, like 10 seconds?

There's usually a lag of 30min to an hour between the last changeset and
the the one that changes the version tag anyway.  I would
hope/assume(dangerous) this is when it's beeing built and tested.  One
more script to that mix that runs a subset of ltp might add an
additional 5 min.  Alternatively, a note of intent to lkml might add a
few seconds to that delay.
If I counted timezones etc. right, here's a quick picture of the number
of minutes between the last changeset and the changeset that tagged it
with the version number:
2.5.60 52 min.
2.5.59 42 min.
2.5.58 31 min.
2.5.57 16 min.
 *** 2.5.58 was release something like 12 hours later
Is it less work to do a few minutes of extra testing, or go through
another release in the same day?
