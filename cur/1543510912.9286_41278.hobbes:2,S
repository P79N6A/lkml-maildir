I noticed these messages coming forth from my system running 
Linux emu.os2.ami.com.au 2.2.10 #2 Wed Jun 16 18:20:49 WST 1999 i586 
unknown
The drive concerned is new, I bought it about two weeks ago. Here's what 
hdarm says about it:
[root@emu /root]# hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:

 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
I have lots of the messages; here are a few:
Sep 27 13:55:22 emu kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Sep 27 13:55:48 emu kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Sep 27 13:55:50 emu kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Sep 27 13:55:56 emu kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Sep 27 13:55:58 emu kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Questions:
1	Is my drive broken? If so, how do I explain it to the dealer from whom I 
bought it?
2	If it's not brokwn, what should I do to avoid these messages and 
optimise its performance?
The drive's installed in a system with an ASUS SP97-V motherboard, P133 
(with F00F), 96 Mbytes RAM. The chipset's SiS5598; I'm not using the 
onboard video.
perhaps this is useful:

[root@emu /root]# 
The system has another 8.4 Gb drive, it works well.
