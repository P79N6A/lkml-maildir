we already allow people to not support a.out formats, this breaks binary 
compatability (probably much more severely then this does)
however we do need to be very sure that if any call is dropped as being 
obsolete it really is not likly to be used (see all the recent flames 
about people dropping (or proposing dropping) features out of the kernel 
for examples of what not to mark obsolete)
