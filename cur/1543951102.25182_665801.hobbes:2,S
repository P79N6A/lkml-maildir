 You'll find the full log here:

 Yes, will do. But I have something to suggest.
 I saw that the patches you've posted here are only a subset of
the patches you have in your FTP. Should I test all the patches
you have or only the subset you posted?
 If you want to get only the subset tested, would be nice to
create a new directory in the FTP for them, that would make
my life easier a bit.
