   Where can I find that alpha, and where do you put upcoming
   alphas/betas?
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/jfs/
Note that the 0.0.1 release has a number of caveats; it only works on
Linux 2.2.2, and if used as your root filesystem, it will turn /dev into
a socket.  :-)
   Well, I don't care if it's production-quality or not, I just want to
   try... I have an empty 80MB SCSI-drive to test on, so no real damage can
   be done...
That's about the right place to test things right now...  you may want
to wish for Stephen's next version, which will fix a number of bugs and
will port things to 2.2.12.
