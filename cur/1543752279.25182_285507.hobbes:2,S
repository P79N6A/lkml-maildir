Are you really serious? Nobody said anything about absolute
perfection. We've got 2 kernels (2.4+lowlat, and 2.6
+realtime_preempt) whose performance *far* exceeds that of any vanilla
kernel, and in the latter case, probably any other desktop OS. We've
even got a kernel (2.6.9 or maybe .10) whose performance is getting
closer to par with OSX. We want people to be able to access this
performance relatively hassle free. Right now, people who want this
have to jump through a lot of hoops to access something they can, and
should, be able to do quite easily.
*That* is what this is all about, nothing more. From the looks of
things, the performance of vanilla 2.6 in this area is going to
continue to improve, but users' ability to actually use it will remain
in the same primitive condition its in now.
