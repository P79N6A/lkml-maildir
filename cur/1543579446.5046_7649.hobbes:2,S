Thanks again for all the help, guys...
Haven't installed 2.4 yet, but I tried the setsockoption route.
Performance is better, but the two processes together never total more
than 50% of the CPU (i.e. the thing is still schedule-bound, not compute
bound, as it is on other platforms), and throughput is only up to 800
sends/sec. Better than the 100/sec. I was getting, but still a far cry
from the identical box running Windows, where performance is 8K/sec.
...and I still don't understand why the identical program, but using one
socket instead of 2 sockets, IS CPU bound, and gets on the order of
10K/sec. on the same HW. Diffs to produce 10K/sec. 1 socket version from
my previous sample follow...
