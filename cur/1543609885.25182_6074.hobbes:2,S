Strange.  While adding a #include for <linux/spinlock.h> didn't work,
tossing in the #define for atomic_dec_and_lock() did the trick.
So now in fs/dcache.c, I have:
#include <linux/cache.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
#define atomic_dec_and_lock(atomic,lock) atomic_dec_and_test(atomic)
#define DCACHE_PARANOIA 1
/* #define DCACHE_DEBUG 1 */
I know that this isn't the right fix; hopefully that will be in -pre5.
Well, now that it compiles, it's time to boot...
