Looking at the source code of ncr53c8xx.c at line 7525 I see:
#if 0
        case 3: /* STATUS  phase */
                nxtdsp = NCB_SCRIPT_PHYS (np, dispatch);
                break;
#endif
        case 6: /* MSG OUT phase */
                np->scripth->nxtdsp_go_on[0] = cpu_to_scr(dsp + 8);
                if      (dsp == NCB_SCRIPT_PHYS (np, send_ident)) {
                        cp->host_status = HS_BUSY;
                        nxtdsp = NCB_SCRIPTH_PHYS (np, clratn_go_on);
                }
                else if (dsp == NCB_SCRIPTH_PHYS (np, send_wdtr) ||
                         dsp == NCB_SCRIPTH_PHYS (np, send_sdtr)) {
                        nxtdsp = NCB_SCRIPTH_PHYS (np, nego_bad_phase);
                }
                break;
#if 0
        case 7: /* MSG IN  phase */
                nxtdsp = NCB_SCRIPT_PHYS (np, clrack);
                break;
#endif
So code to handle these errors seems to be disabled. I tried enabling it
but I still got the problem.
After the phase change I get:
May  7 15:34:47 leaf kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
May  7 15:34:47 leaf kernel: 08:06: rw=0, want=1334509569, limit=704907 
as before
Presumably some descriptor tables for the device have been trashed. Is
this the real problem and is the phase error just a symptom?
