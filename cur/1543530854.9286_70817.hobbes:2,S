    If the problem is an intruder on your system who is attempting a
    deliberate denial of service attack, maybe.  If the problem is a
    program allocating more memory than there is in the system and
    making a different program die because of the overcommit,
    non-overcommit is the best solution to this feature.

    david parsons \bi/ though the rationales for overcommit are interesting.
