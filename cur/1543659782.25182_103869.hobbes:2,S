Sure. I started out doing the patch for 2.5, but hit some hotplug bugs so I
decided to get it working for 2.4 first and then port it to 2.5. I'll get on
that.
A few comments below.

I wanted the user to be able to know exactly which bus speed/mode the driver
switched to in case of a freq/mode change. Besides that it also put the info in
proc as you mention.

Sure, we used to ship a system that only supported 50MHz PCI-X, but I'll have
to get more details on that.
