kmap slots are like any other CPU-local resources - they need to be
protected from context switches and from interrupts.  The slots such as
KM_USER0 are protected by preempt_disable() to prevent this CPU from
context switching and scribbling on this CPU's kmap slot from with another
task.  kmap_atomic() does this preempt_disable() internally.
The IRQ-context per-cpu kmap slots need to be protected from another IRQ on
this CPU by taking local_irq_disable().  IOW:
	local_irq_save(flags);
	vaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_IRQ0);
	diddle(*vaddr);
	kunmap_atomic(vaddr, KM_IRQ0);
	local_irq_restore(flags);
Plus we should do flush_dcache_page() if the page can possibly be mapped
into process pagetables.  I forget whether flush_dcache_page() is safe from
hard IRQ context...
If your interrupt handler is using SA_SHIRQ (and most are), then the
local_irq_save() is needed even within the IRQ handler.
And lo, a bunch of places in the kernel are forgetting to disable local
interrupts.  So if your ode is correctly coded as above, you can scribble
on their kmap, but they cannot scribble on yours.
Failing to disable local IRQs while taking KM_IRQn is a ghastly bug.  I'll
fix 'em up.
