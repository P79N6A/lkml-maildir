The newer tools check for module license tags. Eventually this will be
useful because it will identify proprietary binary only stuff we don't want
reports form. In the short term it'll trigger a few of these because we
don't have all the tags in yet. The -ac tree is pretty close. Once I've 
got the next -ac out and resynched with 2.4.11 I'll push to Linus the
remaining ones only in my tree
