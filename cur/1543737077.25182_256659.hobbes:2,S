Yeah, that's entirely my fault for slacking on sending this out...  I
should have sent this a while ago.  It is a small portion of some larger
sched_domains changes that I am working on, but at some point I realized
my larger changeset will be far more controversial and have a much
larger impact than some of the smaller bits, as well as not being ready
for prime time yet.  Plus, like I said earlier, this allows
arch-specific tweaking with minimal intrusiveness from the application
of this patch forward.

It *should* be.  I'd be quite happy if you just picked it up in -mm to
assure it far wider testing.  I've compiled and booted it on x86, x86_64
& ppc64.  I've got no access to ia64 right now, or I'd test it there. 
But the patch *will* spit out #errors for any arch that doesn't have
SD_NODE_INIT defined if they also have NUMA defined.  I'm don't know of
anyone else (ie: *not* x86, x86_64, ppc64 & ia64) that is building NUMA
kernels, but if they are, it's a trivial patch to their
include/asm/topology.h to make the arch build.
Of course, the ultimate decision is yours, Andrew...
