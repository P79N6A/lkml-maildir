It should be a lot cleaner to do that kind of stuff -- if you feel
it's worth bothering to -- in my changed version.  It's taking a bit
longer than I'd like, because I keep uncovering, ahem, "issues" with
the current code that can be easily fixed once one adds a real
framework for these things.  I hopefully will have something RSN.
