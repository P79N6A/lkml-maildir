Are you going to take a snapshot at IRQ time?  If not, then I'm
pretty much against this change.  When I do a sysrq regs dump,
I want the exact pt_regs values at interrupt time, not some
random value later in time.
Perhaps instead you could raise a flag in the input driver, and
at the top-level interrupt dispatch arch code do the register
sysrq dump.  This gives the same semantics as present, and also
allows you what you want for the input drivers.
But, even with this, there is the x86 interrupt handler Alan
mentioned which wants the pt_regs too.
