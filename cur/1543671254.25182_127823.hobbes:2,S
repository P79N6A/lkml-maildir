Hello,
Will kernel modules compiled with gcc 3.2 load in kernel compiled with
gcc 2.96 (RH system)?  The RH 8.0 release notes state that 2.96
compiled modules can't be loaded on RH8.0 (as its compiled using gcc
3.2). So
does the reverse also hold true?
Either way why is this so? AFAIK gcc 3.2 has abi incompatiblities
w.r.t. C++ and not C (which the kernel+modules are written in). I did
try searching on google but could not find the exact set of
incompatibilies w.r.t C. Can somebody *please* point me to a link or a
thread.
Thanks a lot in advamce
Regards,
A.
