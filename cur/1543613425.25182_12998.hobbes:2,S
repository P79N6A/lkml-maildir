discontigmem makes sense only with wildfire. Can you try to disable it?
I guess the problem is discontigmem enabled and numba disabled, I think
I always tested with either both enabled or both disabled...
dp264+discontimem+numa is supposed to work in a "emulated mode", but
really both discontigmem and numa at the moment should depend on
config_wildfire.
