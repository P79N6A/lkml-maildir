Hmm. I'm not sure I agree with the commit message.
This is documented behaviour on i386 and i486: instruction decoding is 
decoupled from execution, so things that change processor mode have to do 
a jump to make sure that %cr0 changes take effect.
I'm not entirely sure that it needs to be a long-jump, btw. I think any
regular branch is sufficient. You obviously *do* need to make the long 
jump later (to reload %cs in protected mode), but I'm not sure it's needed 
in that place. I forget the exact rules (but they definitely were 
documented).
