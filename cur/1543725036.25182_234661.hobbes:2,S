Chris raises an interesting issue. There are two ways we can benefit from
lock-free lookup - avoidance of atomic ops in lock acquisition/release
and avoidance of contention. The latter can also be provided by
rwlocks in read-mostly situations like this, but rwlock still has
two atomic ops for acquisition/release. So, in another
thread, I have suggested looking into the contention angle. IIUC,
tiobench is threaded and shares fd table. 
That said, atomic counters weren't introduced in this patch,
they are already there for refcounting. cmpxchg is costly,
but if you are replacing read_lock/atomic_inc/read_unlock,
lock-free + cmpxchg, it might not be all that bad. Atleast,
we can benchmark it and see if it is worth it. And in heavily
contended cases, unlike rwlocks, you are not going to have
starvation.

The starvation is a problem with rwlocks in linux, not RCU. The
reader's do not impede writers at all with RCU. There are other
issues with RCU that one needs to be careful about, but certainly
not this one.
