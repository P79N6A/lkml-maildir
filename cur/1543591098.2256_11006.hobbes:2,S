Only if it's augmented by additional device IDs, such as the
"what 's the physical connection for this interface" sort of
primitive that's been mentioned.

Not just hotplug -- any configuration where these identifiers
can change "meaning" (which physical device?) over time.
For example, adding/removing/swapping hardware does it too.

Bob Glamm had the right sort of idea:  if the kernel is going
to be assigning tool-visible device names, the tools need to
have and use additional device metadata, perhaps like this:
>  # start up networking 
>    for i in eth0 eth1 eth2; do 
>        identify device $i 
>        get configuration/config procedure for device $i identity 
>        configure $i 
>    done 
In fact that "identify" step is probably worth enabling for EVERY (!)
device, not just network interfaces.  (Which, since they don't show
up with major/minor device numbers today, are perhaps a bit offtopic
for the original thrust of this thread ... :)
I suppose that for network interface names, some convention for
interface ioctls would suffice to solve that "identify" step.  PCI
devices would return the slot_name, USB devices need something
like a patch I posted to linux-usb-devel a few months back.
