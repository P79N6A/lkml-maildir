yet exploring this space is worthwhile to a certain degree to find the
edges and see if there's a valid issue. Killing the discussion
prematurely makes no sense (but giving too much value to it doesn't make
too much sense either)

Now that the second user is laid bare, I do think it's a valid thing to
at least reevaluate the current state of LSM. So far it appears to not
really be the right interface for AppArmor, and it's also not really the
right interface for SELinux. And it has downsides in its design (the
function pointer tree is just a major source for sucky performance;
processors regardless of vendor don't like function pointer calls much).
So at minimum a debate about most the hooks is in order, as well as the
mechanism; I'm increasingly getting convinced the 'security_ops' thing
is misdesigned. I rather have a setup where the hooks at compiletime
resolve to the function of the LSM you've chosen (be it SELinux or
AppArmor) rather than the current solution. It's not like you
realistically can or want to provide both SELinux and AppArmor with the
same kernel anyway..
