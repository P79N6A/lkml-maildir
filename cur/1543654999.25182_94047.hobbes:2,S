I typically do 
$ make -j4 MAKE="make -j4" bzImage
to build kernels. However, in the recent bitkeeper tree (as ~7pm CST), it 
fails with:
make -j4 -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/i386/boot arch/i386/boot/bzImage
make[1]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
make[1]: *** read jobs pipe: Is a directory.  Stop.
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
as the last few lines. However, a single-threaded make completes fine. 
More output is available upon request.
