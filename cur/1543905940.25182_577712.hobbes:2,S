The hardware is called (E)IDE, the protocol is called ATA.
Or that's what I was told -- I think there's some historic
revisionism involved, too.

"mmio-ide" simply is not specific enough.  The device_type
should go, too.
If this IDE interface is board-specific, thee "compatible"
property should include the board vendor name and board
name.  Oh, that's what "emitx" tries to do -- it could be
a bit clearer perhaps ;-)
