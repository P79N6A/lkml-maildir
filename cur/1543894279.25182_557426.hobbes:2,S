  It asks everybody - regardless of circumstance - for the same thing.
  It asks for the effort that was put into improving the software to
  be given back to the common good.  You can use the end result any
  way you want (and if you want to use it for "bad" things, be my
  guest), but we ask the same exact thing of everybody - give your
  modifications back.

The the GPL doesn't do that.  It encourages that.  But what it asks
for is respect for the freedoms it defends WRT the software licensed
under it.
