This is a very useful trick.
If you define a macro such as:
#define foo(x) do_one(x); do_two(x); do_three(x)
you may later be compelled to call it in an if statement:
if(condition)
  foo(something);
note that it would not do what you want as it will only execute do_one(x)
conditionally but do_two(x) and do_three(x) would always be done.
However a do{ ... } while(0) is a nice convenient block which is
guaranteed to execute once.  The compiler (with a -O flag) will not
generate any extra code for the do{}while(0) so its just a macro building
aid.
So you ask: "why not just use a { ... } to define a macro".  I don't
remember the case for this but I know it's there.  It has to do with a
complicated if/else structure where a simple {} breaks.
Cheers,
Bart.
