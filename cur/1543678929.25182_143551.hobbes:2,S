I'm not the author of the driver but I do have my touchpad mostly working
(tap to click doesn't work but I can move the pointer and click buttons).
Make sure you load the synaptics module in XF86Config... then you want
your pointer section to look something like:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "MouseS"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option  "device" "/dev/input/event1"
        option  "protocol" "event"
        Option  "edges" "1900 5400 1800 3900"
        Option  "Finger" "25 30"
        Option  "MaxTapTime" "20"
        Option  "MaxTapMove" "220"
        Option  "VertScrollDelta" "100"
        Option  "MinSpeed" "0.02"
        Option  "MaxSpeed" "0.18"
        Option  "AccelFactor" "0.0010"
        Option  "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
        Option  "EmulateMidButtonTime" "20"
EndSection
it uses the event devices, not the mouse devices.
