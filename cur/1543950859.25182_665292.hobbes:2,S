OK, I'll toss it in there, thanks.
It sounds like significant changes will be happening and that we can expect
to see a new patchset?
I assume you noted my s/get_current/read_current/g fix?  It'll be needed for
alpha, frv and mn10300.  read_current() is a pretty crappy name but I couldn't
think of anything better.  It would look nicer if we also did
s/get_voltage/read_voltage/g - your call.
