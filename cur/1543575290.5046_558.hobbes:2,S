	Please do not underestimate 802.11 (and others). Even two
cards based on the same MAC controller can have very different way to
handle bit rate setting (fixed, auto with fallback, range, ...). Check
wvlan_cs.c and airo.c for details...
	And also remember that 802.11 is not the only Wireless LAN out
there, there are more Symphony + HomeRF sold through retail than
802.11 combined. Not talking of HiperLAN 1/2...
	Regards,
	Jean
