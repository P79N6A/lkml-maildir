Depends on the drivers you're using - one of the SCSI drivers failed to
work properly on certain alphas were udelay()'s speed varied by a factor
of 2 depending on the next instruction after the udelay assembly (this
has been fixed now).
Fixing loops_per_sec to the highest possible value should always work
though.
