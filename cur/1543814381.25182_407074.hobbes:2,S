"The only thing that's different is the thing you said was different."
:)
It looked strange to me because I have two systems with a VT8237R and on
both, lspci says "VT8237" for both the PCI and the ISA bridges. So the
result provided by Etienne suggests that a different (supposedly
earlier) version of the VT8237R has a different ISA bridge sub-device
embedded.
Not that it really matters, anyway, so I probably shouldn't have
commented on it in the first place.

There are many of these, indeed. South bridges include several
sub-devices, and it is very frequent that chip manufacturers do not
upgrade all these sub-devices when they release a new version of their
chip.
My original comment was really related to the specific case of the
VT8237R, not general.
Thanks,
