I see this was admitted to 2.6, with nice symbolic constants, too.
But before taking this, I would like someone to do this:
 1. posess a device which flakes like the above
 2. take the 2.6 version rediff and test it
 3. explain to me why he or she cannot just run 2.6 and be content
If Sebastien is willing to clear these hurdles I erected (and mentions the
vendor and device number of his hub), I'll think about it. But it would be
best if someone else came forward.
