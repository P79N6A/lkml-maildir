nope, the thing is that irq.c is being compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer,
which breaks __builtin_return_address(0).

no, he should try something like: 
		printk(enable_irq() unbalanced from %p\n",
			__builtin_return_address(0));
+		show("unbalanced irq");
which will show us the strack trace without crashing the process.
