I've been away from the list for a while, so this has probably been 
discussed.
But, it seems to me that being able to have a different IV for
each filesystem would be a good thing, but having it depend on something
as volatile as sector of the disk, seems bad.
What about the first block of the underlying file holding an IV?
Then, if a loopback mount attempt finds a valid IV block at the 
start (heavily CRC'd or similar, so the likelyhood of it ever
finding false magic is negligable (Say 10^-50)) it mounts
the filesystem, using the IV found.
Please tell me where the glaring error is :)
