Here are some numbers on a 2 socket Xeon with HT and mwait idle.
Average of 3 runs, tbench, single client and single server processes on:
		samethread	samecpu		othercpu
before patch:   188.684 MB/s    189.237 MB/s    172.306 MB/s
after patch :   188.425 MB/s    191.628 MB/s    174.224 MB/s
The improvement on other CPUs should be due to the removal of
RMW operations in resched_task.
