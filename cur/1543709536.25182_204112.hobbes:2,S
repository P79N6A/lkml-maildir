Hi,
I switched to 2.6.3 from 2.4.x serie.
When I mount DVD-RAM it is mounted read-only:
[root@venus olaf]# mount /dev/dvdram /mnt/dvdram
mount: block device /dev/dvdram is write-protected, mounting read-only
[root@venus olaf]#
In 2.4 it is mounted correctly as read-write.
Drive: Panasonic LF-201, reported in Linux as:
MATSHITA        DVD-RAM LF-D200         A120
SCSI controller: Adaptec 2940U2W
Please CC me.
Regards,
Olaf Fraczyk
