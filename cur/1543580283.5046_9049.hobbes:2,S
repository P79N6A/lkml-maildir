Dear Hotmail Staff,
as I will soon be unable to receive eMail from certain people,
I strongly suggest exchanging the software of your Cisco fire-
walls by a newer version _yet released_ by Cisco which is able
to cope with ECN-connections instead of sending them RST.
I do not speak only for me but also for my friends using at least
five other Hotmail accounts and for all people who are subscribed
to any mailing list on vger.kernel.org.
Thank You,
-mirabilos
