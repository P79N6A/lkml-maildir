libc can easily mmap /dev/zero in chunks of multiple MB at a time if
it wants to, and can then dole out that memory as if it was a huge
piece of the heap without kernel involvement.

You then break all programs which allocate large arrays on the stack.
You cannot have an arbitrarily growable heap, AND an arbitrarily
growable stack, AND have the kernel correctly guess where to place
mmaps.
One answer may be to start mmaps down near the heap boundary, and to
teach glibc to be more willing to use mmap() for even small mallocs.
That may break custom malloc libraries but should give the best
results for code which uses the standard glibc malloc: it doesn't
artificially restrain the stack or the mmap area.  Anything
relying directly on [s]brk will be affected, of course.
