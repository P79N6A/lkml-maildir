Subject: [PATCH] kdump: Fix for boot problems on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
There was a buggy (and unnecessary) reserve_bootmem call in the kdump 
call which was causing hangs during early on some SMP machines. The 
attached patch removes that.
Kindly include this patch into the -mm tree.
Thanks and Regards, Hari
