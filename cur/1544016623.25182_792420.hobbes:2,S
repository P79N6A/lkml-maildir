It's not exactly related to the charger, it's rather related to the USB voltage
supplied to USB devices attached to PXA OHCI.
Indeed the mfd/da903x.c serves as a common core for sub-peripherals, but IMHO
adding a subdevice driver because of single method doesn't worth the overhead.
I'm for the solution Jonathan proposes.
