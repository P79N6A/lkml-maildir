The "ifconfig up then check link status" method is probably usable for the
vast majority of cases.  Are there any driver/card combos that *can't* be fixed
to support that?  (A somewhat hidden side effect is that if you're doing this,
the driver also needs to be able to support additional ifconfig calls later
to set encapsulation, address/netmask, and the like.  I've run across dain-bramaged
older hardware/software (not Linux-based) that would require an 'ifconfig down'
followed by 'ifconfig foo <value> bar <value> up' to change stuff....
