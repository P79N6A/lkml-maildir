No, I think it should be intel_845_setup too, since the 845G docs on
Intel's public web site show that the behaviour is like the 845 when
the on-board graphics isn't enabled.  I made that change in my
locally maintained version of the agpgart driver a little while ago,
but haven't had the opportunity to test it with an external AGP card
in an 845G box yet.
