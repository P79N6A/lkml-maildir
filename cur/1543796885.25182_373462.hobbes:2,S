Hi Thomas,

Before I get into a detailed review, I have to asked a question I already

Since I posted the ptimer patches, I haven't gotten a single direct 
response from you, except some generic description in your last patch.
I would prefer if we could work together on this, but this requires some 
communication. I know I'm sometimes a little hard to understand, but you 
don't even try to ask if something is unclear or to explain the details 
from your perspective.
Slowly I'm asking myself why I should bother, the alternative would be to 
just continue my own patch set. I don't really want that and Andrew 
certainly doesn't want to choose between two versions either. So Thomas, 
please get over yourself and start talking.

It looks better, but could you please explain, what these extras are good 
for?

Nice, that you finally also come to that conclusion, after I said that 
already for ages. (It's also interesting how you do that without giving me 
any credit for it.)
Nevertheless, if you read my explanation of the rounding carefully and 
look at my implementation, you may notice that I still disagree with the 
actual implementation.
BTW there is one thing I'm currently curious about. Why did you rename the 
timer from high-precision timer to high-resolution timer? hrtimer was just 
a suggestion from Andrew and ptimer would have been fine as well.
bye, Roman
