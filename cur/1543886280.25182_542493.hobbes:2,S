Why not implement this as follows? That way we're able to (1) be
consistent in style with spin_trylock_irqsave, (2) type fewer lines,
(3) touch fewer files, and (4) not add extra bulk to kernel text size
either.
For the sake of completeness of the API, we could also add a
read_trylock_irqsave, but I'd be against the _irq variants (or should
we call them hazards) that don't save / restore.
