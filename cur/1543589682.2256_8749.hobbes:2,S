Hi
I just installed 2.4.4 on our alpha SMP boxes (ES40) and now I have
problems with the serial console:
sulogin does not accept input from the serial line
mingetty does not accept input from the serial line
agetty works fine
Everything works fine for the 2.4.2 kernel. I took the .config file from
the 2.4.2 kernel to compile the 2.4.4 kernel.
Any ideas?
