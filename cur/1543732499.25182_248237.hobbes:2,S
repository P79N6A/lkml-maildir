Right. And when space runs low, the old copies get the axe. And then you
need the old version... and are royally screwed because you trusted the
system to save it for you while willy-nilly fooling around.
I never liked the MS-DOS "undelete" feature, because I saw too many people
burned. It is _less_ data security than "deleted file is gone for good", in
the end sum.
