Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Intel IXP4xx network drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
The next 3 patches:
[1/3] changes "depends on HDLC" to "select HDLC" for WAN/generic HDLC
      network drivers
[2/3] adds "fuse" functions to help determine installed IXP4xx CPU
      components and to reset/disable/enable them.
[3/3] adds IXP4xx drivers for: hardware queue manager, NPE (on-chip
      network coprocessors), built-in Ethernet ports, built-in HSS
      (sync serial) ports (currently only non-channelized HDLC).
Patch [3/3] requires patches [1/3] and [2/3]
The code is based on publicly available information:
- Intel IXP4xx Developer's Manual and others e-papers
- Intel IXP400 Access Library Software (BSD license)
- previous works by Christian Hohnstaedt <chohnstaedt@innominate.com>
  While I have decided to rewrite most things from scratch, his patch
  was a great help in understanding what's going on within the IXP400
  code (I took some fragments of his code as well).
  Thanks, Christian.
The code is tested with IXP425 CPU.
