I stepped into the same problems you have reported here.
There's a feature to do linux to behave like other OS and systems, called "hidden".
However it's not included into the default kernel main stream. Although IMHO IT SHOULD BE.
Here is the patch:

Extracted from 
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/docs/arp.html
:
===
Linux kernel 2.0.xx doesn't do arp response on loopback alias and tunneling interfaces, it is good for the LVS cluster. However, Linux kernel 2.2.xx does all arp responses of all its IP addresses except the loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0) and multicast addresses. 
===
Currently linux is the only OS those I have tried with this behaviour:
Solaris 8 -> does not send ARP reply of other interface.
Cisco -> does not send ARP reply of other interface.
Windows 2000, XP -> does not send ARP reply of other interface.
Linux 2.6.0-pre1, 2.4.20, 2.4.21 -> DOES send ARP reply of other interface

Yes, minor security problem arise with this _INTENTIONAL_ behaviour of linux networking.
The official approach is that you play with routing and netfilter/arpfilter to solve this _INTENTIONAL_ behaviour and make linux behave like other OS do.
The unofficial (not in the kernel main stream, reason unknow) is to use the "hidden patch".
This works using a /proc switch: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<XXX>/hidden, so it should not break anything.
However is not into the main kernel.
