Subject: [PATCH][FYI] special inode handling in 2.3.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

1.	efs_read_inode() didn't convert the device number to kdev_t.
The patch below fixes it (init_special_inode() does the conversion).
2.	Folks, in 2.3.x we have a better mechanism to initialize in-core
inodes of special files (everything but regular files, directories and
symlinks). Pseudo-manpage follows:
NAME
	init_special_inode - initialize in-core inode of special file.
SYNOPSIS
	#include <linux/fs.h>
	void init_special_inode(struct inode *inode, umode_t mode, int dev);
DESCRIPTION
	init_special_inode does all necessary initialization of in-core inode
	of special file. It sets i_mode and i_op according to mode argument.
	For devices it also converts device number (dev) to kdev_t and sets
	i_rdev field. For FIFOs it supersedes init_fifo(). There are two
	places where it is typically used - foofs_read_inode() and
	foofs_mknod() (see examples in fs/ext2/inode.c and fs/ext2/namei.c).
HISTORY
	Introduced in 2.3.1
	Please, consider switching to that mechanism. It will save
everybody a lot of PITA if/when the changes in device/FIFO/socket handling
will happen. In the official tree almost everything is already there
(exceptions: efs, romfs, devpts and openpromfs)
