Audio connections are going to be windowed/flowed
in some way (thats how the internet works) so
you're not dealing with real capacity issues in
that example. You're not going to overrun your
ethernet adapter with an application; the issue
is running applications on servers that are also
doing a lot of other things. You can't isolate a
particular application at the device level, so
you drop packets randomly; not just ones you
don't care about. If your application can't run
well on your machine without dropping real
traffic, then you need a faster machine, not an
OS that compensates in a negative way.
