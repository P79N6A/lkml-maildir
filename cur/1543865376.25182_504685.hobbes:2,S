This patch seems to not handle the cases where more than one process mlocks
a page and you really need a pincount in the page to not release it before
all processes have munlock it or died.  I did a similar patch a while
ago and tried to handle it by overloading the lru lists pointers with
a pincount, but at some point I gave up because I couldn't get that part
right.
