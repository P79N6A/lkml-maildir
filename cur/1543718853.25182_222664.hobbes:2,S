That would possibly be reasonable.
I would only want the extra message if the 'switching cache buffer
size' messages happened at a high rate, and occasional individual
messages are not an indication of a problem at all.
Maybe something like the following, but the recent/cnt/warned should
really be per-array.

===========================================================
convert high-frequency raid5 warning to more specific warning.
Atleast 'warned', and possible cnt,recent should be per-array.
