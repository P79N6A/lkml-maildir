Wrong! The correct fix is not to redefine any of the standard variables!
Instead either do force the necessary flags in the make rules in Rules.make
or do something like this:
  KERNELCFLAGS := -D__KERNEL__ -IS(HPATH)
and then redefine the .c.o: rule in Rules.make to include KERNELCFLAGS before
CFLAGS. As for crosscompiling: that can be dropped from the makefile and
stuffed into a shell script in the scripts directory.  It is so little used
that there is really no need to clutter the main makefile with it...
Yours,
