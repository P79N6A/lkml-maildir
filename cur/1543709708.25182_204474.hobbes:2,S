Hello,
I'm wondering is there any way to access "large pages" (4MB) memory
other than using shared memory ?  For example can you do anonymous mmap
to get access to large pages. 
I would like to utilize large pages for MySQL buffer pool and other
large caches, but would not like to use Shared memory for this purpose 
as it will complicate things for users.
