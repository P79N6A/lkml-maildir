Yes. Perfectly safe:
mv /usr/bin/exeimage /usr/bin/exeimage.sav
cp /wherever/exeimage /usr/bin/exeimage
The executing task will continue to use the old image until it exits.
New tasks will use the new image. You can even replace `mv` and `cp`
this way. It is best to test new programs first, though, so you
know that it's linked with a runtime library that you have on your
system.
