Sys-rq - T: shows device_suspend() is called, perhaps that explains. It
seems that any attempt to suspend either USB hub or device connected to
it results in freeze. :\ Just guessing. 
Anything else should I try ?
hcd_submit_urb
wait_for_completion
default_wake_function
usb_start_wait_urb
timeout_kill
usb_internal_control_msg
usb_control_msg
hub_port_suspend
__usb_suspend_device
locktree
usb_suspend_device
__link_walk_path
device_suspend   <----- still called ?
ohci_reboot
generic_ide_ioctl
activate_task
__group_send_sig_info
sys_kill
block_ioctl
block_ioctl
do_ioctl
vfs_ioctl
get_name
sys_ioctl
sys_enter_esp
