I agree, i2c-sibyte is very old code, and unmaintained, coding style is
horrible. That's one more reason to not include random style cleanups
in a patch doing functional changes, the improvement will hardly be
visible. If you care about cleaning up the code of this driver - and I
would appreciate that - please make a separate patch.

And I thank you for that.
