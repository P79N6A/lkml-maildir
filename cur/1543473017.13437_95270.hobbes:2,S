Actually, X11 on my system zips along.
But there is definitely something wrong with 2.1.132.
To recap:
* x11amp broke
* SMTP is very slow
* other machines on my network cannot talk to Linux 2.1.132
Today I installed the new OpenBSD 2.4 on my Alphastation (Linux
refuses to run) and had the CD mounted on my Linux machine running
the 2.1.132 kernel.  The BSD machine was unable to contact the
Linux machine.  _ONE_ time it managed an ftp connection long enough
to get a list of packages, and that was it.
Going back to 2.1.124 and the BSD install worked fine and the machines
are talking just fine.
I have a cheap NE2000 PCI in the Linux machine, but it has always
worked fine before.

I didn't test TCP since I couldn't even talk to my BSD machine
earlier.  I'm spending most of my time with family at the moment
so it might be a couple of days, though holidays tend to get me
bored... :)
