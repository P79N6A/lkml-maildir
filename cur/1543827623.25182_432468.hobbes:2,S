It assumes you don't have an IOMMU - relies on all memory
being accessible by ohci1394. On x86-64 it can't access > 4GB 
also, but that's normally ok because the kernel log buffer
is below that.
I guess if you use 1394 with remote DMA for other protocols (like
video etc.) there must be some way for the subsystem to map
the memory even on IOMMU systems. I admit I haven't dived that
deeply into the 1394 subsystem so I don't know how that works.
