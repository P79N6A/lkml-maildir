Yes, about 1270 now.

Haven't seen anything like this.

Can't complain on mine either :)

275 here is misleading (wraparound). Actually it should be something
like this:
10:55 [poczta(p0)$/home/lech7] uptime; FFF=`echo 2*497+275|bc`; echo $FFF;
date --date "$FFF days ago";last -1 reboot
 10:56am  up 275 days, 12:03,  1 user,  load average: 0.12, 0.21, 0.10
1269
Wed Sep 25 11:56:05 MET DST 1996
reboot    ~                             Tue Sep 24 20:27 
Not exactly the same dates, because (a) 497 is not the exact
wraparound number (b) uptime hours/minutes are ignored - but
such an approximation is quite enogh for me :)
