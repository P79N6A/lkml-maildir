Hi!
_isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (6816, 13927917)
I get a lot of these messages since I've upgraded to 2.3.19 (SMP).  
The message appears for ALL files.  Each affected file has its own set of
blocks which appear in messages.  Nothing changes after remounting.
This doesn't happen in 2.2.x version (same machine, same everything).
What is strange, everything seems to work fine, i.e. operations that
provoke the messages finish successfully without showing/reporting any
data corruption.
Linux version 2.3.19 (root@genoveva) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #3 SMP Sat Oct 9 11:13:00
