Well, I just finished compiling the 2.6.11-rc4 kernel and the problem
persisted. This time, I enabled ACPI debugging and it indeed generates more
details.
Right after the problem persisted, I turned off the second HD (which was
the master of the secondary channel of the Promise controller) and the
problem automagically went away. :-(
One other thing is that the BIOS still configures the drive as UDMA 4, but
Linux downgrades that to UDMA 2. I'm not sure why.
Using hdparm manually with "hdparm -c1 -u1 -d1 -X udma4 /dev/hde" enables
things that the kernel doesn't and seems to be working wonderfully.
I don't know what I should do right now. I have put the newer dmesg logs on
<
http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/ide-problem/>.
 Should I contact anybody else?
I do need the second drive on, though.
I'm CC'ing Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz, as he is listed in the MAINTAINERS
file as the IDE maintainer.
Thanks for any comments and help, Rogério Brito.
