First, sharp's modifications were not to the base 2.4 kernels, but you
first applied the rmk patch and then the pxa patch.
I have tried to split up the huge patch
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~lenz/zaurus/files/slc860-patches.tar.bz2
But the original patch is hosted around here somewhere.  To find where,
take a look inside the .bb file inside OE... you should be able to check
out openembedded (from www.openembedded.org) and find the .bb file that
builds the kernel.
