Not tested yet, still reviewing the code.

This is not going to work generically, as there number of atomic kmaps
available is limited.  You have four: one for input and one for output,
each in user in softirq context (hence the list in crypto_km_types).  A
thread of execution can only use two at once (input & output).  The crypto
code is written around this: processing a cleartext and ciphertext block
simultaneously.

Looks like this i is left over from something no longer use.

There are several places such as this where you use literal 1 & 0 instead 
of the new macros, SCATTERWALK_IO_OUTPUT & INPUT.

The logic of this is inverted given the function name.  While the calling 
code is using it correctly, it's going to cause confusion.
Also confusing is the remaining clamping of the page offset:
static inline void scatterwalk_start(struct scatter_walk *walk, struct scatterlist *sg)
{
	...
	rest_of_page = PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - (sg->offset & (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1));
        walk->len_this_page = min(sg->length, rest_of_page);
}
rest_of_page should be just PAGE_SIZE - sg->offset (sg->offset should
never extend beyond the page).
  
And then how would walk->len_this_page be greater than rest_of_page?
