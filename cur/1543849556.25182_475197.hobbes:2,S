This seems like a generally useful idea - certainly more valuable than 
storing+printing the function name.
You might want to look at the BUG patches I wrote, which are currently 
in -mm.  I added general machinery to allow architectures to easily 
implement BUG() efficiently (ie, with a minimal amount of BUG-related 
icache pollution).  If you were to store the BUG_ON expression, it would 
be best to extend struct bug_entry and store it there - doing it in 
asm-generic BUG_ON() means you still end up with code to set up the 
printk in the mainline code path, and it also won't honour 
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE being disabled.
