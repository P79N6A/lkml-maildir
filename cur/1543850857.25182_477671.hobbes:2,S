I'm not exactly an ACPI expert, but I do not think there is an entry for
HPET in the ACPI, as the check in arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c fails:
 358                         /*
 359                          * All timer overrides on Nvidia are
 360                          * wrong unless HPET is enabled.
 361                          */
 362                         nvidia_hpet_detected = 0;
 363                         acpi_table_parse(ACPI_HPET,
 364                                         nvidia_hpet_check);
 365                         if (nvidia_hpet_detected == 0) {
 366                                 acpi_skip_timer_override = 1;
 367                                 printk(KERN_INFO "Nvidia board "
 368                                     "detected. Ignoring ACPI "
 369                                     "timer override.\n");
 370                         }
But, with some help from anonymous sources, I have been able to find the
HPET and make it work using a userspace driver that pokes registers by
mmap'ing /dev/mem.  So we just need a way to tell the kernel it's there.
Presumably this would require a PCI quirk.
Is this likely to be worth the trouble?
