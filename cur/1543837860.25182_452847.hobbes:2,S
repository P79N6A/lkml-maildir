We don't use any kind of power management (not compiled in) as our 
systems are always on... Is there any timing related options in the 
kernel config you'd recommend I look at?

Okay, I've tried disabling both preemption and interrupts (separately, 
and together) and its still hanging...
I've had the Celeron systems being thrashed for well over 4 days now, 
and they are working fine... Why would the VIA system be any different? 
They have a slightly different CPU speed (the VIAs are 1000MHz, whereas 
the Celerons are 850MHz), but I would expect them to be fully compatible 
otherwise... unless its a microcode bug?
Any more ideas? Do you think writing to port 0x80 could be causing issues?
Thanks,
Chris
