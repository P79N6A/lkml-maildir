Not necessarily.  The disk may buffer additionally. Handling that
differs widely, but modern Linux forces flushes to platter if the hardware support 
it.

1MB is nowhere near huge by modern standards. Many IO subsystems are
only happy with multi MB requests.

Hardly. Especially not if you do synchronous fsync inbetween.

Yes that is something that needs to be investigated. That is why I suggested
oprofile if your assertation of a more CPU overhead on Linux is true.

Your mental model of a IO subsystem seems to be quite off.
Think what happens when you fsync and submit synchronously.
It's like sending something down a long pipe and waiting until it arrives
at the bottom and you hear the echo of the impact. Then only then you send again. 
There will be always long periods when the pipe will be empty.
If you use large enough blocks these gaps will be quite small and
might effectively become unimportant, but 1MB is nowhere near big enough 
for that.

/dev/sdX*. However it has some other issues that also don't make
it ideal. File systems are usually best.
