 Once the firmware load is over, whether normally or because of any error
 request_firmware() cleans up, and that includes removing sysfs files.

 Once klibc and hotplug go into the standard kernel I'll look into
 request_firmware support there, even ACPI could benefit from it, but
 until then ...
 Although I don't have it clear, what happens between mounting the real
 root device on top of rootfs and hotplug starting to handle events?
 Maybe hotplug could treat firmware events specially and not delay them
 even while booting.
 I guess that we will get the real taste of it once initramfs gets it's
 klibc and starts being used broadly.
 Have a nice day
