Hi Jim,
I did not follow this thread so I don't know where it all started from but
ioctl(2) can and should be used on regular files to implement
filesystem-specific (exotic?) features. For example, ext2 has currently
getflags/setflags/getversion/setversion ioctls that you can use to
manipulate individual inodes.
As for the standards, ioctl(2) is reasonably standardized on STREAMS
devices only, but not on regular files.
