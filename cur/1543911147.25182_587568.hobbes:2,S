The correspond to the exact location on disk on XFS. But, XFS has it's
own inode clustering (see xfs_iflush) and it can't be moved up
into the generic layers because of locking and integration into
the transaction subsystem.

The elevators have no clue as to how the filesystem might treat adjacent
inodes. In XFS, inode clustering is a fundamental feature of the inode
reading and writing and that is something no elevator can hope to
acheive....
Cheers,
