Adrian, 
I really prefer having these warning fixes, even if they are Obviously
Right (tm), come to me through the maintainer.
If the respective maintainers dont respond in lets say 1 month, then 
please resend me saying "I've tried to contact the maintainer with no 
success". 
I appreciate your work, but I also care about driver maintainers.
Thank you.
