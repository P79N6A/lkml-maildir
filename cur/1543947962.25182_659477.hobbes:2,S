Yes, you are right. I'd like to remove all uid/euid checks. This patch doesn't
do this because
	- perhaps it will be possible to kill this helper
	- if we remove these checks, we should do some subsequent cleanups
	  in drivers/usb/core/, while this series is all about LSM hooks.
I am going to do this later.

I think it is not good that LSM has some special (and unneeded!) hacks for USB.
Please also look at the next patch.
Do you agree?
Oleg.
