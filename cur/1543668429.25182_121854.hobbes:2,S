Hey all -- I was not sure where to send this, so my applogies for the
mass send.
I am running a stock 2.4.20, and I get the following oops when I try to
insmod eepr100. I do not get the same thing when using the e100 driver.
Both are compiled as modules, and running on an updated RH 7.2.
The following is the infomation from the e100 drivers about what chipset I have:
Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver - version 2.1.24-k1
Copyright (c) 2002 Intel Corporation
e100: selftest OK.
e100: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/100+ Management Adapter
  Mem:0xf4200000  IRQ:18  Speed:0 Mbps  Dx:N/A
  Hardware receive checksums enabled
  cpu cycle saver enabled
e100: selftest OK.
e100: eth1: Intel(R) 82559 Fast Ethernet LAN on Motherboard
  Mem:0xf4203000  IRQ:21  Speed:0 Mbps  Dx:N/A
  Hardware receive checksums enabled
  cpu cycle saver enabled
The ooutput from ksymoops is attached as oops1_out. Please let me know
if there is any more information I can supply. 
Nic
P.S Please CC me on any replies.
