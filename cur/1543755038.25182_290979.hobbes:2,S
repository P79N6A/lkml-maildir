Then the dependency should in that case be on architectures. It is 
connected similar to a floppy (which is not dependent on ISA and uses 
isa_virt_to_bus).
The point is that isa_virt_to_bus() is the method used by devices 
connected in the same way. This works on the platforms where the device 
can be found (i386 and x86_64). We can not make it dependent on ISA 
since you cannot enable ISA on all platforms where it exists (i.e. 
x86_64). Either fix that or make the driver depend on architecture the 
same way floppy does.
Using the generic DMA API might be a viable option now that x86_64 seems 
to be fixed. But it doesn't have a good track record so I'm not prepared 
to commit any changes until I have time to properly test it. There might 
still be assumptions about PCI lurking around.
