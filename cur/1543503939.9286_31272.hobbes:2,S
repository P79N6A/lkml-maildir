Ok, here's a tcpdump of the offending operation.
I talked to the phone company, and they watched the FR
portion of the circuit while I ran this test. During
the retries there was no activity. They also report
that they are not recording any dropped packets. This
leads me to believe that it must be in either the
hardware (doubtful) or in the kernel. I also find it
interesting that if I plug that same adapter into
another computer (using the crossover cable that goes
to the DSL modem) everything works fine. At Benjamin's
suggestion I tried disabling timestamps, and that did
not make a difference. Rene said that their DSL works
only with an MTU of 1450 or less. That did have a
positive effect, but eventually the same thing
happens.
Again, Redhat 6.0 with the RH packaged 2.2.5-22
kernel. The DSL is hooked up to the integrated isa
ne2000 on irq 5 port 320.
