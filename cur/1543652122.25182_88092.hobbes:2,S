Subject: Multiple kprobes per address

I noticed that kprobes is designed around the idea of only allowing
a single probe point per probe address.  Why not allow multiple probe
points for a given probe address?  Is it a way of limiting complexity?
It looks like it would be fairly straight forward to change get_kprobe(addr)
to be get_kprobes(addr) where it returns a list of probe points associated
with the address, and then tweak do_int3 to work through the entire list.
Would such a change be acceptable?
