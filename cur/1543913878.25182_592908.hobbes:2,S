I think you really misunderstood some major features of these patches
then. Doing an immediate_set on a variable has the same semantic as
setting a normal static variable. If the write to the equivalent
variable would be performed atomically (e.g. 32 bits or less variable on
a 32 bits architecture), it will also be done atomically on an
immediate value reference.
Code patching of _live_ SMP code is allowed. This is why I went through
all this trouble on i386.
So the locking is the same for an immediate value that it would be for a
static variable. If you are concerned about the fact that we have to
iterate on multiple load immediate sites to enable the variable (which
is done non atomically when there are multiple references), we end up in
a moment where references may be in a different state at a given time.
But this is no different from out of order read/writes of/from a static
variable and how older copies may be seen by another CPU : if you hope
that multiple CPUs will see a coherent copy of a static variable at a
given point in time, you clearly have to use the proper locking that
will order read/writes.
Immediate values are mostly meant to be used in contexts where we can
allow this time window where, during the update, some references will
have one value and others won't. Therefore, doing :
immediate_int_t var;
in function:
BUG_ON(immediate_read(&var) != immediate_read(&var));
might fail if it is executed while an immediate_set is done on var. But
if we would have:
volatile int var;
in function:
BUG_ON(var != var);
and, in another thread:
var++;
We _might_ race and see a different value. What is do different about
it?
When we activate a feature that is protected by a boolean, we currently
have to accept that we will, at some point, be in a state where code
paths will see the enabled value and others will see the disabled one.
(this is the choice we do in tracing, and the choice that has to be done
when using atomic updates without locking).
The only guarantee you get is that once the immediate_set is over, all
further references to the variable in memory will see the new variable.

module mutex is only there to allow coherent iteration on the module
list so we can patch each module's code.

I would be ok with that.

I could remove the unlikely(), no problem with that. Your point about
this is valid. However, I would like to leave the immediate_if() there
because it may become very useful if someday gcc permits to extract the
address of a branch instruction (and to generate assembly that would not
be reached without doing code patching).

Changing the compiler should be perfectly feasible, *BUT* I think we
need a transitional solution that works on existing compilers.

This is much more of "we'll do that in the following 1-2 years", since
we have to deal with a full gcc development cycle.  However, I really
want to see this being implemented in a way that would let us DTRT in
the long run."

We don't need to stop execution of references at all. Not needed. (as
explained above). I wouldn't want that anyway, since I want to use this
for tracing which must be as non-intrusive as possible.
No locking, live update, is imho much simpler :)
