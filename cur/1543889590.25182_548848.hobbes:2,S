The problem isn't really mine, I just got the ball when it came to
fixing it. :)
The problem with rootdelay= is that it's a hammer when the problem
requires a screw driver. In order to get reliability, you need to whack
it hard and give it a long delay. But that has the unpleasant side
effect of having the boot taking way much more time than it really needs.
The original thread is here:
http://marc.info/?t=117879392100022&r=1&w=2
At the end of that thread I suggest a more universal approach, which I
submitted for comments here:
http://marc.info/?t=117914570700004&r=1&w=2
I believe this is a more clean approach than forcing all subsystems to
be synchronous.
