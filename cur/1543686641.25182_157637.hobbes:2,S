Yes, it would still be considered down. But that does not imply
that pressing it doesnt do anything. It is up to the driver
to discard key presses, and I think it shouldnt.
(Unless of course the user asks for that behaviour - it may be required
on some broken laptops.)
Just the simple: a keypress generates an interrupt and we see a keystroke.
Use a kernel timer only when we know or the user tells us that it is needed.
Not in the default situation.

But that would require users to report on precisely which keys are affected
and would give complications where I suppose 2.4 did not have any.
This is the way towards an ever more complicated keyboard driver.
Not what you would want.
