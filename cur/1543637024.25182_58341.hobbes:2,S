The comma changes are gratuitous, as pure ANSI C explicitly allows such
constructs. (It was intended to simplify automatic code generation, as
well as for programmer ease to automatically deal with initializer
lists.)
From the grammar section of the 2nd edition (ca. 1988) of K&R:
	initializer:
		assignment-expression
		{ initializer-list }
		{ initializer-list , }
...where initializer list is what one would expect.
Removing the size forward declarations does make the code quicker to
read, though.
