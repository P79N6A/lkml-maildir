Nope not w/ 'hdparm' with DiskPerf and correcting for CR3's on memcpy's.
[root@via DiskPerf-1.0.3]# ./DiskPerf /dev/hda
Device: IBM-DTLA-307030 Serial Number: YKDYKM37674
LBA 0 DMA Read Test                      = 56.62 MB/Sec (4.42 Seconds)
Outer Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 35.46 MB/Sec (7.05 Seconds)
Inner Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 17.72 MB/Sec (14.10 Seconds)
When you adjust for memory delays (of 35-40%) then you get those number.
and those numbers are valid inside for kernel-kernel access, not
kernel-user-space.
