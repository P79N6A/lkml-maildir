No, on Lenovo (and in general actually) the firmware should *not* touch 
the backlight.  Otherwise if another driver touches it the driver and 
firmware will be out of sync, causing unexpected and undesirable 
behavior.  We intend to fix this for the Intel driver at least 
(requiring both ACPI video driver and gfx driver updates), others will 
probably follow eventually.
