You analogy is wrong: Thomas and Ingo spread flyer for "free food", above 
is my frustration about all the people wanting free food.

I do, just without the focus on the lifetime, which is really unimportant 
for most kernel developers.

James, after giving me a rhetoric lesson you maybe should be a bit more
careful with your own rhetoric. What kind of answer do you expect after 
insulting me?
The short version is that I didn't bring up the network timer problem, I 
only made a suggestions how it could be solved, but nobody followed me up 
on it, so I guess the problem wasn't really that big. Please check the 
archives for details.
bye, Roman
