I confirm, if you disconnect the device / unload the driver, it doesn't 
take long and the kernel reports an exception. My fault, sorry.

I'm attaching a new patch:
- revert video device release code to original no-op,
   using correct function signature.
With this patch applied to 2.6.7, I am able to connect/disconnect the 
camera, load/unload the driver 20 times and everything still works fine.
No warnings during compilation (which was the original reason to mark 
the driver broken, IIUC).
Thanks and Regards,
Kai
