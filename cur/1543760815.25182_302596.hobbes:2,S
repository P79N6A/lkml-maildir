Hi Lee,
I just compiled PREEMPT_DESKTOP and mounted root (only disk filesystem on
my test machine) as data=ordered.  I had no problem getting to X, starting
an xterm and running a make. Actually it was a gnome-term since I didn't
have xterm. But then I su to root, apt-get xterm, ran xterm, and did a
make there with no problems.
Did you patch this against 39-02 or -40-X?
I haven't had time to upgrade to 40 yet.  Maybe, I'll work on that today.
Maybe your crash has something else to do with.  My test machine has a
serial hookup that I can look at even if the term goes down. I'll see if
40 gives me problems.
