We may also want a user-asm symlink pointing to user-$ARCH.
If <linux/foo.h> wants a definition from <user-$ARCH/foo.h> then it has
to include <asm/foo.h> which includes <user-$ARCH/foo.h>.  If asm/foo.h
is empty other than the include, then it'd be nice to delete it and have
<linux/foo.h> include <user-asm/foo.h> directly.

It's occasionally been on my mind that the transition from linux -> asm
should be one way and that asm files should not include linux files.
I'm not sure this is necessarily a worthy goal, but it seems worth
mentioning.
