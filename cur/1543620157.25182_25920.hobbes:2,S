Plus there are different CRCs or no CRC (FCS) at all.
In fact, we're using "idle flags" version only (?).

Not sure what do you mean - we don't aim at raw HDLC only. Raw HDLC
is included for completness, as well as things like FR or PPP are.
If you think of different encapsulation, it can be added of course.
