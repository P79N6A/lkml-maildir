Pages that have been allocated by our custom allocators get passed
into standard linux subsystems where we get no control over how
they're freed. We want the normal page ref counting etc to happen
as per normal, we just want to intercept the final free so that
we can return it to our allocator rather than the standard one.
We use custom allocators in a number of places, most notably for
the pages storing the packet data fragments that are pointed to
by skbs. This enables us to providing guest virtual machines with
zero-copy access to the network, which is a big performance win.
The existing arch_free_page mechanism very nearly does what we
want, we just need to add the 'early exit'.
Thanks,
Ian
