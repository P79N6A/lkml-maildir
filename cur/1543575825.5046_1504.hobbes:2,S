Hi,
I believe I've found an inconsistency between the behaviour of poll(2)
and select(2); select() is restartable in the face of signals
(sys_select() returns ERESTARTNOHAND if a signal is pending), whilst
poll() is not (sys_poll() returns EINTR).  On Feb 13 2000, Andi Kleen
posted a patch for 2.2.14--2.2.15 that fixes this (reproduced below;
the explanation is somewhat confusing and doesn't match my problem,
but the patch does The Right Thing), but it hasn't gone into any of
the subsequent 2.2 series.
Is this deliberate?  And if so, why (because it's just bitten me quite
badly)?  If not, I assume this has been fixed for 2.4?  I note that
this problem (i.e. restartable system calls) has cropped up a few
times on the list, always with poll(2), usually in combination with
job control or gdb, so it _does_ appear to be confusing users and
breaking code (or at least breaking code that expects BSD signal
behaviour as the default, which I believe is also the POSIX
way---please correct me if I'm wrong about this last one).
Guy.
