Releasing resources with children
What does it mean to release a resource with children?  Should the
children become children of the released resource's parent?  Should they
be released too?  Should we fail the release?
I bet we have no callers who expect this right now, but with
insert_resource() we may get some.  At the point where someone hits this
BUG we can figure out what semantics we want.
