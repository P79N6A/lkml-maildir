You didn't append the patch, which is annoying, but I'll deal..
The main problem I have is the code placement. I put the CPU stuff under 
arch/ because I anticpate wrapping the cpu structure with an arch-specific 
one, so you can ascertain arch-specific information via the generic 
structure. Moving it out of arch/ precludes that from happening (easily). 
Ditto for memblks, though I'm not really sure what other info you'd want 
in the structures. 
Ditto+ for nodes, or boards. Those are definitely arch-specific 
structures, and shouldn't be in drivers/base/. On top of that, I don't 
think their registration should all be munged together in one file. Maybe 
they should be, in their own play area (under arch/i386/mach-ccnuma/).
