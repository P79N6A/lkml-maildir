I might like to use IPX at some point, but right now I don't think
it's implicated, since when I tried to stop the multicast packets by
rebuilding the kernel without multicast support, I also turned off IPX
(as well as APM, which Alan Cox pointed a finger at).  I still saw
some ethertype 8808 packets going out.  But, I haven't verified that
they were identical to the ones that toast the Cisco.  For obvious
reasons, we did it on an isolated test net consisting of my machine,
the server & the sniffer.
