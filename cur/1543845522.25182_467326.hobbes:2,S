My understanding is that kprobes are triggered by breakpoints, so I am think that any 
perfmon function that can be called along the same path, i.e., traps, needs to have the
__kprobes prefix.

This is ugly!
The P6 PMU actually has only one enable bit for all counters and it is in PERFEVTSEL0 which
you are using for NMI. Thus counters are NOT independent. Architectural perfmon looks like
it is fixing this issue.  I am not sure this is actually true based on the findings of the
PAPI people for instance.
The P4 PMU has independent counters, i.e., enable bits. The issue is that to stop a counter
requires clearing the CCCR which also contains the overflow information (has the counter
overflowed?). So you need to read the CCCR, save the value somewhere, clear the CCCR.
You need some save area that you can safely access without grabbing any lock (because you
are in the NMI handler). I cannot use the perfmon context because it could be accessed from
other processors, and I would need to grab the context lock. I need to investigate how to
do this in a different way. Maybe change the logic used to detect which counters overflowed
by not using CCCR.

I don't have the man pages ready yet.
