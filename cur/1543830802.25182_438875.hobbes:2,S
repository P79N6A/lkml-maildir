You're probably correct on that model. However, it all depends on the actual
workload. Are people who actually have large-CPU (>256) systems actually
running fork()-heavy things like webservers on them, or are they running things
like database servers and computations, which tend to have persistent
processes?
Of course, I'm biased by my environment - the big Mac cluster and 2 larger SGI
boxes we have quite likely spend hours at a time where the exit/sec for the
entire image is in the single and low double digits, and the per-cpu value
is down in the noise.  But they're pure machoflops boxes....
