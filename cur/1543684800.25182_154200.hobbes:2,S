Yes you must have (I replied off-list by mistake and then forwarded to the

I was under the impression that silraid.c never worked at all (it
certainly didn't on my system), because the magic number it looks for is
incorrect (actually, part of the drive's serial number), and thus not
present on all systems with this RAID).
I have since found out that some people have been using Arjan's driver
with success, so my final version of the patch will certainly leave it in
so people can migrate to the new driver at their own pace.
Regards,
Thomas
