Hello,
I took time to read FAQ, and here are few comments.
1 - I understand you don't like RedHat, but instead of ranting, you could
just say that gcc-2.96 from RH updates or RH 7.1 is OK (Alan Cox even
recommends it for compiling recent 2.4 kernels).
16 - also "df -i" shows that there are no used inodes on reiserfs partitions.
36 - Can I use /sbin/badblocks -b <reiserfs-block-size> on existing
reiserfs partition?
39 - a link to "I'm not using RedHat's special release of a buggy compiler"
(
http://www.namesys.com/gcc-2.96
) is not found.
40 - spelling error "ResierFS".
41 - there is nothing about how to solve it.
Regards,
Nerijus
