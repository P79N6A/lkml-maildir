I know.  I wrote it.

In that case I just dunno what's going on now.
I thought we were discussing the removal of this, from __free_pages_ok():
#ifndef CONFIG_MMU
	if (order > 0)
		for (i = 1 ; i < (1 << order) ; ++i)
			__put_page(page + i);
#endif
by using compound page's refcounting logic instead.  But !MMU really wants
to treat that higher-order page as an array of zero-order pages, and that
requires the usual usage of the fields of page[1], page[2], etc.
So what I'm saying is "compound pages are designed for treating a
higher-order page as a higher-order page.  !MMU wants to treat a higher
order page as an array of zero-order pages.  Hence give up and stick with
the current code".
What are you saying?
