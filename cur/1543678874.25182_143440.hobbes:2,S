For what it's worth, we have been completely unable to reproduce these
kinds of results at Transmeta; our results are in fact very consistent
with the numbers reported by some people for the Sharp MM-10 "Kitty"
which is also a 1 GHz TM5800; all of them have been in the 10 minute
ballpark.
I have written a script to try to give a consistent compile benchmark;
however, one still needs to make sure that DMA is turned on (hdparm -d
/dev/hda); obviously, the compiler etc should not be on NFS.
The timed portion (make -j3 bzImage) part of this script takes
10m15.035s real time (user 9m10.890s, sys 0m43.350s) on my 1067 MHz
Crusoe prototype system (256MB SDR, 256MB DDR, ATA33 disk) -- don't
have TC1000 Tablet PC numbers yet, but I have asked someone to run it
-- running RedHat 9 including distro kernel and gcc 3.2.2.  It
produced a bzImage file that's 1151608 bytes long when I ran it.
Note that it uses "make -j3" for the bzImage, and so aren't really
comparable to your times listed above.
You obviously need to point the KERNEL variable at a suitable copy of
linux-2.4.21.tar.gz.  The script needs to run as root in order to
create the tmpfs.
