 okay.
 i am not so worried about this scenario _because_:
 under an selinux system, you would set up a policy which only
 allowed the good_proc to exec other_good_procs (with the
 macro can_exec(good_proc, { other_good_proc1, other_good_proc2 })
 consequently, you'd design your firewall rules (in conjunction with
 your selinux policy) to add _two_ dev+inode-program-enabled firewall rules
 to cover the same socket, e.g. apache2 (good_proc) and some cgi script
 helper (other_good_proc) - one for each program:
	 iptables -A INPUT -m tcp --dport=80 -m program --exe=/usr/bin/apache2 -j ACCEPT
 and:
	 iptables -A INPUT -m tcp --dport=80 -m program --exe=/usr/cgi-bin/blahblah -j ACCEPT

 i would not consider this to be a problem [in an environment where
 you specify DENY as the default and ALLOW specific instances]
 under such circumstances [file descs passed between programs]...
 you would end up having to create _two_ program-specific rules, like
 above.
 one for each of the two programs.
 [this has got to be better than the present situation, where you have
  to "iptables -A OUTPUT -m tcp --sport=25" and that allows ANY process
  under the sun to have data escaping on port 25.]
