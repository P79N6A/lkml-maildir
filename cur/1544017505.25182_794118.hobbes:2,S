They were build fixes for a -rc kernel.  Even if I agreed with your new
feature work, that's inappropriate for the -rc stage (and actually would
take much longer).  Holding regressions fixes hostage to new feature
work is wrong.

The pain being where you break it and I fix it?

I thought I fixed everything: it works for me (tm) on all my PC like x86
boxes ... if it's broken on something more esoteric, you'll actually
need to send me details so I can fix it.  What exactly is broken?

I addressed all the review issues ... even that thread you quote has my

Right: it's a compile time HAL.  Your "cleanup" is to convert it to a
runtime one, which is a lot more complex because voyager still has to
influence the x86 path in those locations regardless: it's not an x86 PC
architecture and so is never going to be able to boot through an APIC/MP
table SMP boot sequence.
I'm not actually bothered by the complexity, though ... it would be cool
for me to have a kernel that boots on both voyager and a PC.  What
worries me is the cost (both in terms of execution time and maintenance
burden) this would impose on the standard PC path.
The other thing I will point out is that if you think a runtime HAL
simplification could be applied to the current kernel, a compile time
HAL could equally well be done.

Hmm, but what that shows is that the PC configuration path is complex
anyway.  Voyager doesn't really make that much more so (as shown by the
fact that most of those depends have things other than voyager in them).

Visws isn't very different from a standard PC ... it's really only about
how the apics get included and a few SGI specific things (like mem
configuration, reboot and power off).
I think the runtime piece is probably doable ... largely because
virtualisation has already cost us hugely via function pointers in this
area, so the extra additions to pull in the few voyager differences
might not be that noticeable.
I really don't see how the boot path can be simplified by this ... in
fact, I think it will grow in complexity.
So ... the probable way to get this to work is to boot x86 as a UP
system and then enable SMP later on (voyager can boot a standard UP
kernel because the SUS can emulate a UP PC) ... basically switch to SMP
using alternatives and then bring the CPUs up via hotplug.  This
approach is really very different from the way x86 works today, where
the SMP structures are sprayed throughout the architecture specific
directory.
It can work, though ... hotplug bringup is how we boot parisc SMP as
well ... I just think it will be a lot of perturbation to x86.

Look, I've already told you your quirks don't work because of the way
voyager boots.
However, voyager can make use of the current quirks you have ... it's
just there'll be a lot left over when that's all over, plus some pieces
of the infrastructure itself will need adjusting.  So why don't we do
this:  Fix what's broken now (or show me what needs adjusting about the
fixes) and I'll update voyager to use the current quirks infrastructure
(and update the infrastructure).  Then we can both look at what's left
over when that's finished?
