The unmodified kernel and the unmodified drivers are available
from ftp.kernel.org and other sources, the vendor doesn't have
to supply them, only tell you where you can get them if you want them.
Anything the vendor wrote in user-space is the vendor's own stuff.
The vendor doesn't have to supply them at all.
Transparently upgrading across the network is a pretty good idea.
It seems that the "secret" protocol they are using pissed you off
so you think they must be doing something wrong.
Cheers,
