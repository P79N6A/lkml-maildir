FYI, there are already some kernel-doc rules in
Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt.  These rules work with the
doc. generator in the kernel tree (scripts/kernel-doc).
Do you have suggestions for how to make them (the rules) better?
so that the in-tree kernel doc. will improve...
Q2:  what do I get when I download one of the tarballs from kernel-api.org?
Q3:  Can we see your sed scripts?
Thanks,
