Subject: [PATCH] reduce size of struct dentry on 64bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/15/160

Reduce size of struct dentry from 248 to 232 bytes on 64bit.
- Reduce size of qstr by 8 bytes, placing int hash and int len together.
  We gain a further 4 byte saving when qstr is used in struct dentry
  since qstr goes from 24 to 16 bytes and the next member (d_lru)
  requires 8 byte alignment (which means 4 bytes of padding).
- Move d_mounted to the end, since char d_iname[] only requires 1 byte
  alignment. This reduces struct dentry by another 4 bytes.
With these changes the number of objects we can fit into a 4kB slab
goes from 16 to 17 on ppc64.
Note the above assumes the architecture naturally aligns types.
