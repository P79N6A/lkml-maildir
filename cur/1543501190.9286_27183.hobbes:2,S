For move, it's a little bit more involved so I won't put it here,
but you get the idea.
for email:  I want my MUA to allow me to put attach directories.  It is
a useful feature in its own right.  And it really isn't hard to have your
MUA do a tar+gz and put a application/x-tar-dir annotation and untar at
the other end.  Of course podfuk also allows you to do it transparently.
So even those arguments don't have much weight.
The only issue as far as I can see is the performance and for that
reiserfs is pretty close to what we want.  attribute inheritance is the
only thing missing, I believe.
