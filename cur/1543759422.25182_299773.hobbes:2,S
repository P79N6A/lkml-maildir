  I've inserted an option i8042.noacpi:
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11 ro root=/dev/hda4 rhgb quiet i8042.noacpi
  to my /boot/grub/menu.lst, and, oh miracle, it works. Moreover, this
option fixed the old problem: mouse and keyboard were dead when I enabled
hyperthreading in BIOS. Now it works with hyperthreading. Excellent!
Thank you very much!
