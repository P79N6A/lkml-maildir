Subject: kernel hangs when trying to remove a bridge

I'm using kernel 2.6.16 (-gentoo-r13 actually). A bridge iface br0 is setup 
using eth1 and eth0.1 (VLAN) as slaves. To bring br0, what I do is to remove 
the slaves from the bridge first, "ip link set dev br0 down" next, followed 
by the brctl command to remove the bridge. What happens is that it seems it 
tryes to destroy the bridge iface, and then hangs, with dmesg complaining, 
periodically, about once a second, something like:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 1
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 1
...
I say it partially hangs because commands like ifconfig hang (ps state=Disk 
busy)...
To reboot the machine, a HARD reset is required, since, the shutdown process 
hangs... 
Cheers,
Rodrigo
