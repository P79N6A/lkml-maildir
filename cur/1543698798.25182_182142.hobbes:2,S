I think that this is what we want, ie know how windows handles the spic
since i just bet that all the mb manuf. ppl only care about windows and
anything else is secondary. [Can we get some more info from nvidia about
differences in the setup?]

And that some great 2 hours, everything was dandy, screen refreshes
faster (moving windows with contents was snappier and you saw less
trailing refreshes)... but it ended in a beeeeeeeep deadlock.
I later reproduced it again in console mode... It required 2 full grep
-rne test * in my /usr/src, that is, 2.6.0-test11 and 2.4.23*2 + some
rpm's... all in all: 624M + 219M
