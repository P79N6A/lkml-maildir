Honestly I wonder if some of these situations really want 
"kill_scheduled_work_unless_it_is_already_running_right_now_if_so_wait_for_it"
Since its during shutdown, usually the task just wants to know that the 
code in the workqueue won't be touching the hardware or data structures 
after <this> point.
