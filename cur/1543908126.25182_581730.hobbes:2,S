...except for the small point that this isn't how volatile works.
Rule of thumb: even people who know the semantics of volatile
shouldn't use it.

The other way around.  "volatile" has pretty weak semantics, and
certainly not the semantics you think it has, or that you wish it
had; but *(volatile XX *) doesn't have *any* semantics.  However
much you cast that pointer it still doesn't point to a volatile
object.
GCC will generally take the path of least surprise and perform a
volatile access anyway, but this has only be decided recently (a
year ago or so), and there very likely still are some bugs in
that area.

If you don't know what to expect, you're screwed for sure.
Anyway, what's the supposed advantage of *(volatile *) vs. using
a real volatile object?  That you can access that same object in
a non-volatile way?
