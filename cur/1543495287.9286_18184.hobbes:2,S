ANSI/IEEE Std 729-1983 Software Engineering Terminology, IEEE
Software Engineering Standards, ISBN 1-55937-008-4
States in part (pp 25);
" Operating system. Software that controls the execution of
  programs. An operating system may provide services such as
  resource allocation, scheduling, input/output control, and
  data management. Although operating systems are predominately
  software, partial or complete hardware implementations are
  possible. (ISO) An operating system provides support in a
  single spot rather than forcing each program to be concerned
  with controlling hardware. See also system software. "
pp 35
" System software. Software designed for a specific computer
  system or family of computer systems to facilitate the 
  operation and maintenance of the computer system and associated
  programs, for example, operating systems, compilers, utilities.
  Contrast with application software ".
Clearly GNU makes system software.
	It cannot be the "GNU/Linux operating system"
It is:
	"GNU system software and Linux operating system"
possibly:
	"GNU-System/Linux-OS"
