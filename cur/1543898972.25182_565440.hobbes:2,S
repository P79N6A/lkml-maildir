Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/2] PM: Update system power off code

Hi,
The following two patches update the system power off code.  They:
* remove the (unnecessary) call to acpi_sleep_prepare(ACPI_STATE_S4) from
  acpi_shutdown()
* remove acpi_sysclass and device_acpi that are only defined to register the
  ACPI power off preparation callback in acpi_shutdown() and introduce more
  general mechanism instead
Greetings,
Rafael
