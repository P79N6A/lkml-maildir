it's only one example. clear_page() working only on a full page is a
nice restriction that allows the implementation to be optimized (again
the x86 hardware that had a hardware page zeroer comes to mind, the hw
is only 4 years old or so... and future hw may have it again)
clear_page() is more restricted than memset(). And that's good, it
allows for a more focused implementation. Otherwise there'd be no reason
to HAVE a clear_page(), if it just was a memset wrapper entirely.
