No that's not what I was suggesting.  The page split model allocates
an skb with a very small head that accomodates only the headers.
All payload is stored in the frags structure.
For 1500-byte packets, we can manage the payload area efficiently
by dividing each allocated page into 2K chunks.  The page will
then be automatically freed once all the 2K chunks on it have been
freed through the page ref count mechanism.
Cheers,
