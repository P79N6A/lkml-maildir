Basically, I am not intended to have my own syscall.
I am generating a report on all deleted file and directory. For that I
trapped sys_unlink() function and calling a external program using
call_usermodehelper(). Since sys_unlink() is called very frequently in my
case, memory leak caused by calling call_usermodehelper kills all the
process in the system.
Just to narrow down the problem, I introduced my own syscall.

most of all don't implement your own syscalls!

well clearly not quite since you're adding syscalls to it.
Also 2.4.20-8 isn't the current Red Hat Linux 9 kernel; 2.4.20-27.9 is.
