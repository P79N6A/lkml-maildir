Also, that is why my example code doesn't check the
end_that_request_first() return value, it must be 0 or it would be
buggy. Alternatively,
        if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, rq->hard_nr_sectors))
                BUG()
would make that more clear. Or just a nice little comment. Anyway, if
you fixup lguest I'll add a kernel helper that we can switch it to once
merged.
