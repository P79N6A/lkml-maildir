Besides, a core dump hardly indicates "OS is not working properly" as it's more
of an indication that "Application is not working properly."  If you had a
kernel panic that would be something entirely different.  And, it's been
debated on this list more than once as to what constitutes the OS, but I tend
to define the OS as the kernel.  Others may argue that it includes the C
library, and some "essential" applications like e2fsck or whatever, but you can
hardly blame the "OS" for the failure of a userland program.  Just like you
can't "really" blame Microsoft if a particular application crashes regularly. 
You can, however, blame them if an application takes down the OS though.
All this is off topic.  As stated, no one can help with the amount of
information provided.
