You might want to take a look at
http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~loizides/reiserfs/
where I try to answer the one of your criteria, namely performance,
and how performance behaves over time, eg. when the file system
is heavily used...
The focus is on ReiserFS compared to Ext2, though I plan to set up
some tests with XFS and JFS soon (to get the results before end
of october)
