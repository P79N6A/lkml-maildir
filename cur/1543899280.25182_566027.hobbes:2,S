Thanks, I am using it on 2.6.22-rc7-git5, have run a stress test 
yesterday night.
It seems to be as stable as the previous version. I guess it's safe to 
turn it on
by default when it gets into Linus' kernels.
I have a question though. Why is the blanket needed for Maxtor drives?
Can't it be narrowed down to certain models? Maybe those models
should be put into libata blacklist...
Not that my current machine is affected, I am just curious.
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
