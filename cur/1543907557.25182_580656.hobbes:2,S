It only matters on hard drives which actually use load-unload heads. 
Lots of desktop/server drives (perhaps some laptop ones as well) still 
use contact start/stop, which doesn't remove the heads from the platters 
on shutdown but just parks the heads over the landing zone. I don't 
think arbitrary power-offs make too much difference on those drives. 
(However, these generally aren't rated to handle as many start/stop 
cycles, which is why laptop drives generally use load/unload instead.)
