Hmm, are we in fact really using byte locks in CONFIG_PARAVIRT situation? 
Where are we actually setting pv_lock_ops.spin_lock pointer to point to 
__byte_spin_lock?
Such initialization seems to happen only in paravirt_use_bytelocks() 
function, but my blind eyes prevent me from finding a callsite from which 
this function would eventually get called.
