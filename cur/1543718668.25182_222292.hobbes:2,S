Other archs already do the above. The only reason I can think of is an 
optimization issue. The above code does a spin_lock/unlock more than the 
default code. For archs where the ctx switch is fast, this might matter.
Whereas archs with slow ctx switch might want to use the above code to 
reduce IRQ latency. Also, if the ctx switch code involves acquiring some 
"external" spinlock, care should be taken to verify that cross-lock 
happens (see ia64 code for example). IMO, if this is an optimization 
issue, and if the thing does not buy us much in terms of performance, I'd 
rather use the above code as default. Ingo?
