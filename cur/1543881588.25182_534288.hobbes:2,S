Hmmm.... These not that critical given that 32 bit NUMA systems are a bit 
rare. And if a page is in the wrong area then it can be bounced before I/O 
is performed on it.

If a page is migrated into a different zone and then a write attempt is 
made on it then the page will be bounced into a zone from which the device
can write from.
