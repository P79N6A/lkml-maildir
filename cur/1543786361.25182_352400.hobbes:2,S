Here's a bit of the PTRACE_SYSEMU patch, committed three weeks ago:
--- a/include/linux/ptrace.h
+++ b/include/linux/ptrace.h
@@ -20,6 +20,7 @@
 #define PTRACE_DETACH 0x11
 #define PTRACE_SYSCALL 24
+#define PTRACE_SYSEMU 31
 
 /* 0x4200-0x4300 are reserved for architecture-independent additions. */
 #define PTRACE_SETOPTIONS 0x4200
OK, I admit I could have made the comment clearer.  But can we fix this? 
You've added PTRACE_SYSEMU on top of PTRACE_GETFDPIC, which presumably will
mess up either debugging or UML on that architecture (if the latter were
ported).  That's exactly the problem we defined the 0x4200-0x4300 range
to prevent.
