You use the wrong distributor, try Alan Cox ;-)

I would regard a stable kernel which doesn't compile, or which corrupts
filesystems in operation normal to all systems (umount) as correctness
issues, which should be caught if even the smallest QA were being done.

A point some folks sem to have missed.

Agreed. But I would like to have seen it sooner, allowing all the
developmental stuff to be fully developed in 2.5 before it was dropped
into 2.4. By putting new features in 2.4.x we had the worst of possible
results, end users got a less stable kernel and developers were slowed
down by release cycles. This didn't really make anyone happy, I believe. I
expect both 2.4 and 2.5 to work better now.
