I believe this is wrong approach.
For atomic snapshot to work, all devices need to be stopped. If your
video card does DMA, it needs to be stopped. So all drivers need to
know, you can not just exclude part of tree.
Now, you probably do not want disks to spin down and you want your
screen unblanked (as an optimalization/speedup). Patch for keeping
disk up is allready in -mm. Patch for keeping radeonfb up looks like
this, and is pending, too.
If more such patches are needed, post them, but not telling drivers
based on their class is not an option.
