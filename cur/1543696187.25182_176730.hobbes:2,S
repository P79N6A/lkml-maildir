This one will be wierd.
I'm having 4 program running at background using 50MB each (got it from 
"top")
Total up to about 200MB.
The system is having 1GB ram and currently using 92MB as swap. Why does the 
system use the slower swap when there are still memory available (as cache). 
Anyway to "force" the system to use more ram instead of putting into swap 
memory?

Yes - _use_ the memory for something else. 1. All unused memory will be put 
to good use as cache.
2. Memory is taken from the cache whenever you need it for
   something else, so (1) is not a problem at all.
