Right, but isn't this basically the same problem that we already have in
NFSv2?  Last time we looked, when we had shared writes on a page on
NFSv2 we'd just resort to doing uncached writethrough.  Effectively we
are using the writing thread's process context as the cache for the
credentials.
Appying the same rule to NFSv3 just requires that we commit the writes
too in the calling thread when we get shared page writes.  Once we get
into that scenario, correctness is far more important than performance.

Absolutely: right now the VM only really understands memory pressure on
dirty data if the data is in the buffer cache.  The suggested
per-address_space memory pressure callbacks would certainly allow NFS to
start doing early commits of dirty data if the cache memory was needed
for something else.
