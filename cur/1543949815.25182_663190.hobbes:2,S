Yes we made a mistake with 6.8.0 enabling DRI on rs680 chips before we 
knew it worked for everyone, I may be still able to fix this in the kernel 
but there is a good chance that it'll require a 6.8.1 userspace, I can't 
do anything else about it..
Jonathan I appreciate the bug report, I'm more saying to Andrew that 
getting DRI right on new chipsets is non-trivial as there are lot of 
configurations we can't test until we actually push the code to users.. 
and in this case you are one of those..
you might try setting the VRAM in your BIOS to 128MB instead of Auto and 
seeing it helps..
I'll be trying to fix the problem properly quite soon.
The correct workaround is to add Option "DRI" "Off" to xorg.conf or for me 
to travel back in time and unrelease 6.8.0. Removing the kernel DRI 
support will just break lots of working systems.
