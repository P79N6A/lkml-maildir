Actually, there is a (non-GNU) free implementation of the fileutils on
MacOS/X  that treats  and  copies  the .DS_Store  entries  (or say  is
metadata aware).
And  even  though  I might  agree  on  that  the principle  of  having
per-directory  database files is  somewhat hacky,  it appears  to work
like a charm (As long as userland programs do care about it).
On Linux we have a solution that actually works just the same and is a
lot cooler. It's called POSIX extended attributes...

PS. If you want to talk further  on the subject of how MacOS/X does it
and how I would do it using extended attributes, discuss it in private
mail with me, since MacOS/X isn't really Linux. And no, I don't want a
single daemon do  that, but I want it to  be a standard implementation
that libc and fileutils support.
