Yes, that's possible. It should be rare (the windows is a few 
instructions long), and on i386 it doesn't hurt.

What is your problem? Do your mips cpus have mmu contexts (the ability 
to store tlb entries from multiple processes), and you load tlb entries 
with the wrong context id?
The i386 implementation knows that i386 cpus don't support mmu contexts, 
i.e. the whole tlb is flushed during process switches.
