Theses devices are kind of broken anyway, aren't they ? I see no safe
way of handling disk changes on them, except having a "I changed disk in
this drive" button on the desktop and rely on the user's good behavior.
Currently the kernel will may have a wrong idea of what's in the drive
if it doesn't poll, and that may wreak havoc.
