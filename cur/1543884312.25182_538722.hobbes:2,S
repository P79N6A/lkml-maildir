  not only that, but there are numerous files that *already* use
"__unused":
$ grep -rw __unused *
... snip lots of output here ...
as well as a few files that can now have their definition of that
removed:
$ grep -r "define __unused" *
drivers/net/defxx.c:#define __unused __attribute__ ((unused))
drivers/net/declance.c:#define __unused __attribute__ ((unused))
drivers/misc/thinkpad_acpi.c:#define __unused __attribute__ ((unused))
  i think "__unused" is the clear choice here.
