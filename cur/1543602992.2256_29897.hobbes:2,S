One thing that bothers me about your patch is how it limits the number
of CPU's to the number of bits in an unsigned long. While I realise
there are other places that do the same (last time I looked), we
shouldn't be perpeturating these kinds of limitations.
I'd suggest you use an atomic_t instead. Increment for each CPU, and
decrement when each CPU is ready. Just test for 0 in your wait loop.
One less piece of code we have to overhaul later.
