Absolutely. We can't allow just anybody to allocate giant pages, since
they are a scarce resource (set up at boot time in both Ingo's and Intels
patches - with the potential to move things around later with additional
interfaces).

That's _probably_ true. There aren't that many allocations that ask for
megabytes of consecutive memory that wouldn't want to do it. However,
there might certainly be non-critical maintenance programs (with the same
privileges as the database program proper) that _do_ do large allocations,
and that we don't want to give large pages to.
Guessing is always bad, especially since the application certainly does
know what it wants.
