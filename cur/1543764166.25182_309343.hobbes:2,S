Forget about what I just wrote, I've been able to reproduce this in
32bit mode too although it did take a long while to happen.
And glibc in 32bit mode simply uses mov in a normal loop to write to the
memory.
Looks like using mov in 64bit mode polluted my cache and crippled
performance (have been running some other programs in the background)
and thus perhaps didnt trigger the problem.
I'm going nuts with this.
kind regards Philip
