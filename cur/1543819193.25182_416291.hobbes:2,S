I finally think I understand your point.  You are saying that kdb would
have to register for the notify_debugger() chain and would therefore
get in the way of handle_page_fault().  What about changing notify_die()
callout in handle_page_fault() into a notify_page_fault().  That actually
feels a lot better now that you got me to think about it.
