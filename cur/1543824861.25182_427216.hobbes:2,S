All of the relevant bits of "my work" are now in Jeff's upstream libata tree,
from the recently posted sata_mv patches.
After struggling with bad SDRAM earlier this week, I now have Ubuntu installed
and running reliably on my G3 box here.  Next step is to upgrade the kernel
to something modern, and add in the latest sata_mv.
After that, I'll try my own 6081 Marvell card in it, and hopefully see the 
same failures as you.. hopefully!
Cheers
