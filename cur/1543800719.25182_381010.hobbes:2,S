Many people reported this on various mailing lists, but I'm not aware of
any bugzilla/whatever ticket.
Problem seems to be that ALSA/OSS does not report the true HW sampling
rate, but tries to do the sample rate conversion by itself, but
apparently not doing it good enough for modem type applications.
Anyway I find it not a good idea of alsa to try to do sample rate
conversion in kernel for OSS, as the native OSS drivers never did this,
and it is useless for software (like soundmodem) that tries to find out
the hardware rates in order to adapt to them. Kernel resampling badly
interferes with this.

PS: I was too lazy to investigate this in depth, it was easier to just
add a native ALSA driver to soundmodem.
