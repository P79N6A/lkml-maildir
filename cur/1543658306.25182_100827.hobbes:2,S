The average ISP wouldn't notice things were broken unless enough magic
smoke escaped to cause a Halon dump.
Consider as evidence the following NANOG presentation:
http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0210/wessels.html
Some *98* percent of all queries at one of the root nameservers over a 24-hour
period were broken in some way.  And there wasn't even a DDoS in progress
at the time...
Also, I think Andrew was computing the chances that *SOME* packet in the
100T would be mangled in an undetected fashion, so 99% of the time all 100T
would be OK, but 1% of the time there was some subtle block mangling some
dozens of terabytes into the transfer.  Given that the TCP slow-start code
is currently busticated for gigabit and higher (it takes *hours* without a
packet drop to get the window open *all* the way - there's IETF drafts
in process about this), it's quite possible that you'd not notice packet
drops due to error among all the congestion drops kicking the window size
down.....
