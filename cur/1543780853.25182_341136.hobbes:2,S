Every interrupt software, or hardware, results in the branched
procedure being executed with the interrupts OFF. That's why
one of the first instructions in the kernel entry for a syscall
is 'sti' to turn them back on. Look at entry.S, line 182. This
occurs any time a trap occurs as well (Page 26-168, i486
Programmer's reference manual). FYI, this is helpful when
designing/debugging complex interrupt-service routines since
you can execute the interrupt with a software 'INT' instruction
(with the correct offset from the IRQ you are using). The software
doesn't 'know' where the interrupt came from, HW or SW.
