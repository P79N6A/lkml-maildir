Is this new to 2.6.9?  I don't see anything in the diffs that would
suggest a change.  The reason for the behavior you are seeing is
rather obvious.  In mm/shmem.c, init_tmpfs() always calls
register_filesystem() for tmpfs, irrespective of the CONFIG_TMPFS
setting.  The /proc/filesystems is created by get_filesystem_list() in
fs/filesystems.c, which doesn't (and couldn't without an ugly hack)
know that tmpfs is bogus.
If init_tmpfs() did not register_filesystem(), what would the effects
be?  I can't see that it would hurt shared memory maps, which are
implemented on top of tmpfs, but I haven't looked that closely.
Here's a patch (untested) for the brave.
