Has anyone got Oracle (8.0.5) to work with test5 ?
My sqlnet sessions from the client keep getting terminated but there is no
evidence of why. The current database works perfectly under 2.2 but I need
newer kernels for other features
Although not obviously a kernel issue, perhaps it is ?
Ideas appreciated
