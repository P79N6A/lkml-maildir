Hi!
(It took me a while before I understood that that last that referred to
padding inside a struct generated by gcc due to overlong initializers.)
But from the rest of the thread it seems that some people expect the
compiler to warn about the following...
struct {char c[4];} s1 = {"abcd"};
It doesn't. Of course if one wants to be warned in such cases
(initialisation
of a character array of specified length using a string constant) one
could
tell the compiler that the 0 at the end should really be there:
struct {char c[4];} s2 = {"abcd" "\0"};
Writing it like this will give them the expected warning.
