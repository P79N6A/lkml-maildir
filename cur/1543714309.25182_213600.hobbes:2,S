I'm running 2.4.20, and every once in a while I get the "Serverworks
Chipset in impossible state."
But I have the following:
ServerWorks CSB5: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 79
ServerWorks CSB5: chipset revision 147
ServerWorks CSB5: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
which shouldn't trigger that warning, right?
Will I have to upgrade to 2.4.25 fix this, or is there a simple patch I
can apply to 2.4.20 to prevent this lockup from occuring?
ide=nodma is way too slow for my purposes, though it seems to work.
