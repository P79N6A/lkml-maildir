Subject: 2.6.11 timeval_to_jiffies() wrong for ms resolution timers

setitimer for 20ms was firing at 21ms, so I wrote a simple debug module
for 2.6.11.10 kernel on i386 to do something like this:
struct timeval tv;
unsigned long jif;
tv.tv_usec = 20000;
tv.tv_sec = 0;
jif = timeval_to_jiffies(&tv);
printk("%lu usec = %lu jiffies\n", tv.tv_usec, jif);
This yields:
20000 usec = 21 jiffies
Egad!
I looked at the timeval_to_jiffies() inline function in
include/linux/jiffies.h, and after pulling my hair for a few minutes
(okay almost an hour), I decided to ask much smarter people than myself
on why it is behaving this way, and what it would take to fix it so that
"20000 usec = 20 jiffies".
I got as far as this in figuring it out for i386:
HZ=1000
SEC_CONVERSION=4194941632
USEC_CONVERSION=2199357558
USEC_ROUND=2199023255551
USEC_JIFFIE_SC=41
SEC_JIFFIE_SC=22
Thanks in advance for saving me from going bald!
