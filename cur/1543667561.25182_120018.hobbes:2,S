cs.ko doesn't exist, it is part of pcmcia_core here.

Actually this is using the RedHat standard way: /etc/init.d/pcmcia
loads, in order pcmcia_core, yenta.
pcnet_cs get loaded by hotplug, triggered by one of the above modules.
So it seems that what you want is that I disable hotplugging and 
loading pcnet_cs by hand later... Hmmm.

Sure, I'll try that.
