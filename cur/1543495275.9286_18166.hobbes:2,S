You don't really have to clear memory, i.e., write to it. All you
have to do is read all of it with NMI disabled.
Write 0x80 to port 0x70 to disable NMI, enable later by writing 0
out the same port (it's the index register for the CMOS clock-chip).
Since a read or write takes about the same time, it is usual to
just write all memory to zeros, but it is not necessary.
