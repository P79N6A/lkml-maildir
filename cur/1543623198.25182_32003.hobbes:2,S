Hi there -
I was lucky today finding another solution that helped me out:
It seems the 2.4 kernel series produce the problem of messing with PCI
interrupts.
I had no problem with one and the same pcmcia_cs package with a 2.2.9 kernel
which locked up ALL of the 2.4 kernels I tried meanwile (I am on 2.4.18 now
using the kernel-owned pcmcia modules, yenta_socket, which does not seem to know
any parameters at all).
Today I found a hint on giving the kernel an irqmask on bootup in the lilo.conf
file:
append="pci=irqmask=0xafff"
This prevents the vital IRQs of ide or mouse from being taken by the PCI bridge
when the yenta_socket or i82365 module is loaded. (Unloading the module again
would  not give back interrupt control - so a reboot was the final step)

Thanks for your hint!
