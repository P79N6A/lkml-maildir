	This doesn't make it right.
	Ok, while we are on the topic : could somebody explain me why
we can't get gcc to do that for us ? What is preventing adding a gcc
command line flag to do exactly that ? It's not like rocket science
(simple test) and would avoid to have tediously to go through all
source code, past, present and *future* to make those changes.
	Bah, maybe it's too straightforward...
	Jean
