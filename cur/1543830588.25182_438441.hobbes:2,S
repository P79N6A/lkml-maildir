Seeing guestXX-eth0 interfaces by standard tools has certain attractive
sides.  But it creates a lot of undesired side effects.
For example, ntpd queries all network devices by the same ioctls as ifconfig,
and creates separate sockets bound to IP addresses of each device, which is
certainly not desired with namespaces.
Or more subtle question: do you want hotplug events to be generated when
guest0-eth0 interface comes up in the root namespace, and standard scripts
to try to set some IP address on this interface?..
In my opinion, the downside of this scheme overweights possible advantages,
and I'm personally quite happy with running commands with switched namespace,
like
vzctl exec guest0 ip addr list
vzctl exec guest0 ip link set eth0 up
and so on.
Best regards
Andrey
