what it wants to say: 'the futex word must not overflow into the next
page', ie. the futex word needs to be on a single page.

the full test is this:
        pos_in_page = ((unsigned long)uaddr) % PAGE_SIZE;
        if ((pos_in_page % __alignof__(int)) != 0
            || pos_in_page + sizeof(int) > PAGE_SIZE)
                return -EINVAL;
what it says: 'uaddr must be naturally aligned, and the word must be on a
single page'. In theory it's possible that __alignof__(int) !=
sizeof(int).
