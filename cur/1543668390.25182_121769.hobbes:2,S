Yes, you're correct. It was SSE1, not SSE2.
The problem Zwane encountered is that early Athlons don't support SSE1,
only XP+ do
To use it he would need an a new CONFIG split for Athlon XP and earlier
Athlon. iirc it didn't make much difference on the athlon anyways which
has quite fast locked operations on exclusive cachelines - sfence seems
to be more useful on P4.
