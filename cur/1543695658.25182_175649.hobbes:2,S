Looks like good stuff if you want to do a blow by blow.  I decided against this 
in the register save and restore code as it is hardly ever needed.  An asm 
function is another matter and this looks good for that.
An observation:  Once you have the register save info in a CFI call frame, you 
can refer to it from anyplace you do the same save order.  For example, in my 
code, the trap save and the system call save as well as the interrupt saves are 
all covered by the one cfi entry.  This does not work if you want to do a blow 
by blow on the save and restore of the registers.  Also, I don't see the entries 
to do expression evaluation (yet).

Yes, the expression stuff...
