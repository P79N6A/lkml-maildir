Ok. I still have your old patch, I'll just flush it so I don't confuse it
with anything else.
However, I still much prefer the 2.3.x approach (ie just returning more
than just 0/1 - a negative number means out-of-memory). In particular,
your current approach gets the ptrace() case wrong for the SIGBUS case,
and it's pretty much impossible to fix cleanly as far as I can tell.
Note that 2.3.10-pre2 also gets ptrace() wrong, but at least it's not
impossible to fix - it should just bother to check the return value it
gets from handle_mm_fault(). Right now it doesn't.
Note that ptrace() is a horrible special case, being the only thing that
accesses another process VM space (apart from vmscan which is also
horrible, in other ways). HOWEVER, it's rather bad to have a SIGBUS
problem and then when you try to debug it the debugger also gets a SIGBUS,
which is what your approach results in.
