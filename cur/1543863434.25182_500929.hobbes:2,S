Subject: [PATCH RFC] hwmon/f71805f: Fix a race condition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
I think I introduced a potential race condition bug with commit
51c997d80e1f625aea3426a8a9087f5830ac6db3. I didn't realize it
back then, but platform_device_put and platform_device_release
both appear to free the platform data associated with the device.
This makes an explicit kfree redundant at best, and maybe even
racy, as it might occur while someone still holds a reference
to the platform device.
Can somebody with more experience with platform drivers than I have
myself confirm that the current code is broken and that the fix below
is correct?
Thanks.
