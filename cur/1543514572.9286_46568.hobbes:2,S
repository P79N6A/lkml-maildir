The plan (and part of the sinister reason that the new boot code was put
into place) is to gradually phase out the older binutils versions and
migrate to 2.9.5. The older versions just have too many problems, which
although might seem small (and most, truthfully, are) but some are truly
enormous in very subtle ways :)
As the first step, the boot code as is currently stands compiles with all
versions of binutils, 2.9.1.0.7 and up (lower might work, untested). It
does happily whine when compiled with newer binutils, though, as we've
seen.
The next step, once the documentation has been updated and people have
been given a good warning, is to fix up the few warts remaining and have
some 2.9.5 version be the absolute required minimum (at the moment its
only a *very* strong recommendation). Might not even be until 2.5, who
knows for sure.

That was a nice side effect (appearance), but not the sole purpose.
Consistency in kernel usage of asm, leverage in making users update
binutils (because it *needs* to be done eventually), reduction in tools
needed to build kernel, my name in lights, to name a few. :)
