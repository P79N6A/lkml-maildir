calc_load() -> messing with LOAD_FREQ -> once every 5 seconds, no?
I think doing 32/32 bit calculations would be fine.

Apart from the problem Con pointed out, you'd need a fancier algorithm
to calculate load because your interval isn't going to be fixed, so you
need to factor that in when calculating the area under the 'curve'
(loadavg).
I think the good 'ol 5 seconds should be alright.
