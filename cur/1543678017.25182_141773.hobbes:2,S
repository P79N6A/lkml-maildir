I have a uniproc P3-800 system running 2.5.72, and time (from that
system's point of view) is racing ahead rapidly.
By "racing ahead rapidly", I mean this:
	% date ; sleep 60 ; date
	Thu Jun 19 09:04:29 PDT 2003
	Thu Jun 19 09:05:29 PDT 2003
	%
returns in 35 seconds (measured with my eyeballs and cheap wristwatch).
Has anyone else seen this?
Regards,
Andy
