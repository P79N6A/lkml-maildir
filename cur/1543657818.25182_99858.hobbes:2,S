Yes but....
I develop computer games. The last one I did took a team of 35 people 2 
years and cost $X million to develop.
Please explain how I could do this as free software, while still feeding 
my people? Am I a bad person charging for my work?
Really - I want to understand so I too can join this merry band of happy 
people giving everything away for free!
