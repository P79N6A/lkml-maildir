No. If you want it resistent to brute force, use big key. Actually 128bit should be enough.
If user's password has at least 128 bits of entropy, you should be safe, too.
salt only helps with "lets create 1TB of all common encrypted passwords" attack.

This is same as saying that starting encrypted email with
"Hi!" is bad idea. It is not. Don't worry about brute-force, it is not
practical. (Okay, you probably should not limit password length to 8 chars).
