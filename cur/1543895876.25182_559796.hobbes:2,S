No, the core argument of the GPLv3 objections is that you can NOT tell the
hardware manufacturers how to build hardware. You only  can tell software
users what hardware (tivoized) it's forbidden for them. Wether or not the
hardware manufacturers are going to care enought about your anti-tivo
software to remove their tivo protections is a completely different question
unrelated to the software license. Which is why the GPLv3 anti-tivoization
measures are stupid and pointless. 
Please, stop pretending you are hardware manufacturers. You are not.
