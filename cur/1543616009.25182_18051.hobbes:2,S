Hauling out my Gilbert and Sullivan: "I've got a little list" :-)
1. The time slice. Currently this is a #define. Make it a variable and
give me a sysctl to set it.
2. The processor change penalty in the scheduler. Again a #define. Make
it a variable and give me a sysctl to set it.
3. The "memory map" change penalty in the scheduler. Currently
hard-coded to 1 in "sched.c". Make it a variable and give me a sysctl to
set it.
4. The DMA, lowmem and highmem balance ratios and maxima in
"page_alloc.c". Currently these are hard coded. From the code, it looks
like the values I *really* want to change, the watermarks for each zone,
are computed at boot time and can't be changed once the system boots.
But I'd like to be able to change the watermarks at run time if at all
possible.
5. The minimum and maximum fraction of memory that can be allocated to
page cache for each zone.
