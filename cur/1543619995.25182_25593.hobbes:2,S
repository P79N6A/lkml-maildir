I remember discussion of that patch some time ago and the main complaint 
about it was that it increases the size of the kernel, i.e. vmlinuz.  Why 
not put the need info in a module?  Doing that would enable the following 
command:
         zgrep CONFIG_PROC /lib/modules/`uname -r`/config.gz
(or something similar).
