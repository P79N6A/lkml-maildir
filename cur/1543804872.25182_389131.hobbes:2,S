Like Sam replied, I don't see a problem.  But the indentation shown
above isn't how I see it on-screen.  The Digi, EtherExpressPro/100,
and Intel(R) PRO/100+ are all indented under EISA/VLB/PCI for me.
However, here's another one.  On ARCH=i386, the top-level menu shows
[ ] Enable doublefault exception handler
(menuconfig or xconfig)
This is from arch/i386/Kconfig (line 50).  Surely this should be
under "Processor type and features" or some other menu, not at the
top level.
