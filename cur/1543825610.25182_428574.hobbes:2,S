If you mean tcp_hashfn() from 2.4 kernel, I don't believe so.
In fact, if you analyze it, it is not even a very good nor
efficient hash function.  For example, it goes to great pains
to permute upper order bits in the local address, which for
most connections will be a constant value.

The hash value is used to index a hash bucket that has
established TCP sockets attached in a linked (collision)
list.  Because the number of input values is limited, the
number of collisions is bounded.  What the actual bound is
can be determined by analysis or using numerical methods.
Because local address has an extremely limited range, local
port number has a limited range (for dynamic assigment) and
the maximum number of connections will be limited by other
factors (e.g. system maximum number of open file descriptors)
the practical bound is much smaller than the theoretical bound
on the length of the collision list.  Because it is not a very
good hash function, the bound on collisions for a given range
of input values might be greater than if a better function were
used.  Also, TCP allocates rather large connection hash tables
at startup further reducing the size of collision lists.
There are two typcial uses of TCP: well known port numbers
upon which listening servers exist and outgoing client connections.
Outgoing client connections will almost always use a unique port
number.  The hash function does not really exploit this fact.
