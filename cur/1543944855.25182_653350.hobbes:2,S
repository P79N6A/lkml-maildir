We're doing something similar in the DRM these days...  We need big chunks of 
memory to be pinned so that the GPU can operate on them, but when the 
operation completes we can allow them to be swappable again.  I think with 
the current implementation, allocations are always pinned, but we'll 
definitely want to change that soon.
