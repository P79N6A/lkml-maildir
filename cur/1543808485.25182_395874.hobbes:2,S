If the app/OS crashed here, nothing would matter. We haven't committed 
anything at all yet. We've just started the IO. What is at 400-415 simply 
doesn't matter, because nobody would have any reason to look at it.
(Besides, it's not at all clear that 400-415 would or would not be on 
disk. It depends on entirely on timing and buffering of the IO system at 
that point - the fact that its dirty in memory doesn't mean that it ever 
made it into the IO buffer that was started).

This is the one that waits for it to finish, so _now_ we can update the 
pointers (elsewhere) to that log (and if the app/OS crashes before that, 
nobody will even know about it).
See?

No, your understanding was incomplete. I'm talking about just parts of a 
much bigger transaction. 
A single write on its own is almost never a transaction unless your system 
is _purely_ log-based (which it could be, of course. Not in my example).
