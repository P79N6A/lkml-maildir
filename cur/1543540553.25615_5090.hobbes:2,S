The kernel version 2.2.10 as well as 2.4.0-test5
both have a process running named "(lockd)" (e.g. using ps xa)
kernel version 2.2.16 does not seem to have this process
(it is not a normal daemon but part of the kernel).
the 2.2.16 kernel which does not have this process shows
nfs anomalies!
example:
apache can't write it's logs on nfs when using the 2.2.16 kernel,
it won't report any errors. An "ls -al" command when issued for
the first time, shows the normal size of the log file. When issuing
the command a second time, it shows a file size of 0 bytes.
the same system with a 2.2.10 kernel or a 2.4.0-test5 kernel
works fine. The only difference I could find was the (lockd) that
was missing.
Will this "process" be reimplemented again, or is there some
replacement for this?
Kind regards,
Andreas
