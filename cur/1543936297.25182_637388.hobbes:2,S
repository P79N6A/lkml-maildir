Personally I absolutely don't agree with that.
Ivan's patch is another attempt to make MMCONFIG work somewhat better,
but does not provide the explicit opt-in that I think is required at
this point; people have tried to get MMCONFIG stable for a really long time,
and failed still upto today. At least my patience is up and this needs
to be opt-in.
