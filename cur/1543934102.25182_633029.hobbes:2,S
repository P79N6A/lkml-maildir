Glad to see this being done - long overdue.
Most of your patches (if not all) replaces TOPDIR
with objtree but usage of objtree is only
correct when dealing with output files.
Note that objtree != srctree only for O=... builds.
And a few cases should be dealt with differently.
See individual comments.
