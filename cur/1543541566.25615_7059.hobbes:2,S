# Okay, per-program ways of doing this that don't share code and databases

Well..considering that this stuff is already supported in three of the
filesystems Linux supports (although Linux itself doesn't), it makes
reasonable sense that this stuff should go kernel-side. Even if the more
generic stuff lies in userland, you've still got to have kernel-side stuff
in order to handle existing filesystems' implementations.
