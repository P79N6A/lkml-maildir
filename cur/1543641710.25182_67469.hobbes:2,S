Okay that sounds more like it.  The driver did not damage the data, only
user space forced down the driver trashed it.  Regardless of the
definition of "is" you system was wrecked.

This was a great concern of mine when 48-bit was introduced.

You do not want to sign the NDA's to get the data sheets, aquire all the
hardware to test, generate tables of irregularities, query Promise, and
then scratch your head why.
I have a FastTrak 100 TX4 the BIOS fails to see beyond 128GB, but in
practice it does.
The PDC20267 will puke in 48-bit DMA, but run clean in 48-bit PIO :-/
Oh but that is the primary channel, Seconday Channel is clean both ways :-\
PDC20262 works in 48-bit DMA every where.
PDC20265 similar to PDC20267 except yours.
Rules are emperical tests and rants back at the OEM, and ....

Cause there were reports of PDC20265/PDC20267 comming in as deadlocking.
Thanks for the wrinkle in the fabric of ruleless world. :-)

Oh another dang piece of the puzzle found and it does not fit anywhere!
