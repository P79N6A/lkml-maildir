Same thing I reported yesterday -
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105945659716778&w=2
My system is idle and it happens after I boot and move the
mouse with gpm or XFree86.
If I only load mousedev is doesn't work. If I then load psmouse
it goes insane with any of /dev/misc/psaux, /dev/input/mouse0,
and /dev/input/mice.
