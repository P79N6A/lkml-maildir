update to others: Thomas debugged this problem today and found the place
that kept irqs disabled for a long time: it was update_process_times(). 
(which i recently touched to break latencies there - but forgot that the
lock is an irqs-off lock!)
i've uploaded a fixed kernel (-V0.6.8) to:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
(this kernel also has the module-put-unlock-kernel fix that should solve
the other warning reported by Thomas and Bill.)
