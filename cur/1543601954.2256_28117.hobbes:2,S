 Yes, but you need that anyway (see below)

 Talk to the people who wrote the paper (and won
"Outstanding Paper" for it at Usenix). The paper
is quite convincing, so I'm afraid I'll have to
disagree. But as I said, I'll know more when I've
tested further.
 It turns out that a hybrid interface is needed
in any case to handle overload. When the queues
start to fill up, you need to back off and start
basically doing something like a plain-old-poll()
instead. Ref the paper. Here's a link to a kernel
list dicussion that covers similiar ground:

 Also, merging events for the same fd, which
everyone seems to agree is a good thing, is
in fact a "hybrid" approach, right? Since 
you're now tracking state (albeit only between
calls to ioctl(EP_POLL).
 I intend to use some of the original Linux
/dev/poll code, as well as some of yours, but
it's a new patch with a new name.
