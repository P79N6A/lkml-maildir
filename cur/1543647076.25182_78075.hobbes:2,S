This is a USB (and PCI) bug.  I'll fix them, they should be using the
release() callback that Pat has provided.  With that callback, which
gets called when the device really wants to be cleaned up, I don't see
any races in the USB code (well theoretical races, there's still some
bugs in the current implementation that I'm trying to track down...)
