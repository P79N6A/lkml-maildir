You mean only the third paragraph, right? I hope the other two are
accurate.
I'm trying to describe how the feature is used by container systems
and my description is obviously inaccurate. There are subtle semantic
differences between the way the different namespaces work, which you've
pointed out. I think mentioning CLONE_NEWUTS or other flags is too
technical for help descriptions.
For UTS_NS and IPC_NS I think I could remove that paragraph because
the end user hint "Answer Y if you will be using a container system"
remains. For USER_NS and PID_NS however, these features are tagged
EXPERIMENTAL so the hint is "If unsure, say N" and I think I need
to at least mention the use in container systems or find some better
clarifying description which doesn't get too technical.

Per above my response is to remove the paragraph.

Yes, I understand that. Would you agree that your problem is with the
wording "Processes in the container are placed in the PID namespace
corresponding to the container"? And that this is the part that needs
to be fixed?
... todo = revisit these descriptions soon, not today though
