third attempt - the patch below ontop of v2.6.25 should be quite similar 
fastpath atomic overhead to what generic semaphores do? So if Yanmin 
tests this patch ontop of v2.6.25, we should see the direct fastpath 
overhead - without any changes to the semaphore wakeup/scheduling logic 
otherwise.
[ this patch should in fact be a bit worse, because there's two more 
  atomics in the fastpath - the fastpath atomics of the old semaphore 
  code. ]
