I'm going to be on vacation until the 12th, so I won't have a chance to 
do anything until then (perhaps Ian will have a chance to poke at them 
before then).  I'm expecting Becky's patches to work as-is, or if not, 
be easily fixed with a couple of small bugfix patches.  So I say go 
ahead if they work for everyone else.
