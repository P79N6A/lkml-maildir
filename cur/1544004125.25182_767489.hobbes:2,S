Hi All,
the next 2 patches update the nvram driver so that:
* it's in line with our coding style guidelines
* and that we convert the PRINT_PROC macro's to the seq_file system.
Please review the patches and sent me comments.
I someone could also test this on an ATARI architecture/platform:
please lett me know if it works.
Thanks in advance,
Wim.
