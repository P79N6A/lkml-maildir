You mean like trying to run Oracle Apps or something? ;-)
5000 tasks, 2Gb shmem segment = 10Gb of PTE chains (I think).
In ZONE_NORMAL.
Somehow.
Both regular rmap and partial objrmap have their corner cases. Both are
fairly easily avoidable. Both may require some app tweaks. I'd argue
that partial objrmap's bad cases are actually more obscure. And it does
better in the common case ... I think that's important.
regular rmap + shared pagetables is more workable than without.
