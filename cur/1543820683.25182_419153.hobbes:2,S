	C++ has how many additional reserved words? I believe the list is delete,
friend, private, protected, public, template, throw, try, and catch.
Renaming every symbol that currently has a name from this list to the
corresponding name with a trailing underscore is an easily understood
consistent change.
	That you would argue against is with things like "not breaking things" is a
load of complete crap.

	Making ridiculous arguments like that a consistent change of a small set of
names is "breaking things in a stable kernel" is silly.
	And, FWIW, it isn't even necessary to change those names. That is only
needed to compile the kernel in C++, which is not what anyone was talking
about. Supporting C++ modules, for example, would work fine even if the
kernel had variables called 'class' or 'private'. (Though things could be
done a lot more cleanly if it didn't as it would require some remapping
before and after compilation.)
