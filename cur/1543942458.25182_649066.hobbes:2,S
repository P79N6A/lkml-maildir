Indeed.  Could you expand on why this is a problem?

Version 0.62 predates our git history so I don't have the old version to
hand.  I can't spot anything obvious in the information I do have except
perhaps something introduced when the drivers were split to start
pulling out the codec parts.

Well, other than using wm97xx-battery to find it not really.  To be
honest I don't really see what this buys you over using the battery
device since what you suggest means you need to wait until it is
registered anyway.

What sorts of problems are you seeing?  I've done a very large
proportion of my touchscreen work with ASoC completely disabled and
haven't noticed any issues.  In this case I was using the non-ASoC
PXA AC97 driver (CONFIG_SND_AC97_CODEC, sound/arm/pxa2xx-ac97.c).
Within ASoC it should be possible to use the generic AC97 codec driver
but I can't say I've ever tested that.

OK, that's good - sounds like you're doing something fairly standard.

Yes, that'd be really helpful.  I don't have the hardware so any non
working stuff isn't going to affect me too much :) .
