Wouldn't the 'smart mode' (firmware ppp implementation) operate
outside the scope of a generic sync board or ppp channel interface?
The driver for such a board could offer both an ethernet emulation
(smart mode)
interface (eliminating the need for pppd/ppp.o) *and* a generic
sync/channel (sw mode)
interface. Instead of ioctl in the generic i/f to switch between the
two, the driver
would create two devices for each physical port (similar to the normal
and call out
devices for a serial port). Open the ethernet emulation device and get
smart mode. Open
the generic sync device and get a generic interface that allows sending
of any kind of
synchronous frames (x.25, ppp, etc).
It does not make any sense to me to combine a higher level interface
(network/LAN emulation)
for PPP/Frame Relay or whatever, with the lower level generic sync
interface.
