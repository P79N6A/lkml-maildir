Hi.
I0m trying to compile the kernel 2.6.20.7 and I have to select these 
features:
- Video mode selection support
- VGA 8x16 font
but I can't select them because they are unselectable (they appear with 
"---" in the left).
I checked their requirements but all requirements seem to be active.
Why I can't active them?
Somebody could help me, please?
Thank you very much!
Bye,
Luca.
