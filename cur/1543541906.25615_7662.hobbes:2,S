NTFS's streams are exactly like HFS resource forks. Old HFS filesystems
had an implementation limit of 2, but HFS+ (used by MacOS X) lets you
have as many as you like.

I could almost agree with that. Really, you just get a second
stream namespace. One can emulate the other until you hit a
filesystem with both.
Don't forget that XFS, UDF, JFS, and NFSv4 have this type
of feature too. (JFS was hacked to support OS/2)

OK, time to be really sick.
You have a drive f: with a file "bar" in the current directory.
You have a directory "f" in the current directory on the current drive.
Directory "f" has an EA called "bar".
Directory "f" has a stream called "bar".
In the same place as "f", you have a file named "f:bar".
BTW, somebody go see if Viro needs CPR.
I say we find out how the _native_ NT API deals with all this shit.
By that I don't mean Win32, because that is just a subsystem sitting
on top of the native API.
I'd ask the guys at www.sysinternals.com, but seeing the crap they
wrote about Linux having fundamental limitations sure doesn't look
encouraging. Any non-hostile NT kernel experts?
