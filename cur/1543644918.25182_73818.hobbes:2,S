Ok, now go one step further and remove the {IN,OUT}{BYTE,WORD,LONG}
macros and you'll end up with the stuff I had send you previously ;)
Regarding the MMIO ops, where indeed I had some #ifdef CONFIG_PPC
crap, that was because we lack proper abstraction of either an
MMIO version of insw/outsw, or of the barrier (see previous
discussion we had on this issue). It is by no mean yet another
PowerPC'ism ;)
