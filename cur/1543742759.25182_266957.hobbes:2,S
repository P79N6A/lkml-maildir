Disabling unit-at-a-time for i386 is definitely correct.
I've personally observed horrible runtime corruption bugs
in early 2.6 kernels when they were compiled with gcc-3.4
without the -fno-unit-at-a-time fix.
x86-64 is a different architecture. It's possible its larger
number of registers reduces spills enough that gcc's failure
to merge stack slots doesn't matter.
