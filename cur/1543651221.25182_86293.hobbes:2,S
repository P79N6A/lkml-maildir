Yes, but this has annoying side effects like booting single-user and
discovering things like /sbin/ping doesn't exist because mount -a
didn't run yet. Stuff like that sucks.

But they show up as regular files to things like ls. And magically
break when copied, moved, etc.. Backups and bind mounts? It's not
obvious to me how that works.

It's not perfect. Perhaps there's some #! script-like way to do it
where there's only one binary to trust. One more point in its favor is
it works in 2.4...

That's just show.

That might not strike _you_ as weird, but then this is the same guy
who wanted files you could cd into..

You can do that with any capability scheme.
