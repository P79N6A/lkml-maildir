Hi Greg,
sorry, this is a private egoistic request, so I took the liberty and 
removed Linus and Andrew from CC: If this wouldn't make things more 
difficult / worse for you and anyone else, could you perhaps post such 
patch chains as a reply to the first message (patch 0/x) and not each 
subsequent patch as a reply to the previous one? It would make it easier 
to view for _me_ (remember egoistic?) because my mail agent (pine) 
presents mail threads where every reply level produces a small right 
offset in the subject line, so, starting from about reply number 20 the 
subject is completely off-screen.
Again, this is a minor trouble, and, perhaps, I am the only one suffering 
from it, but if it doesn't matter either way for everyone else, I would 
really appreciate it that way.
Thanks
Guennadi
