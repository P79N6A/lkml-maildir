Yes, I agree that we should have the nr_requested and nr_freed type of
counters in appropriate place. And "struct shrinker" is probably right
place for it.
Essentially you are suggesting that we maintain per cpu statistics
of 'requested to free'(scanned) slab objects and actual freed objects.
And this should be on per shrinkable cache basis.
Is it ok to maintain this requested/freed counters as growing counters
or would it make more sense to have them reflect the statistics from
the latest/last attempt of cache shrink ? And where would be right
place to export this information ? (/proc/slabinfo ?,  since it already
gives details of all caches)
If I understand correctly, "slabs_scanned" is the sum total number
of objects from all shrinkable caches scanned for possible freeeing.
I didn't get why this is part of page_state which mostly includes
page related statistics.

Bharata.
