With the inevitable result that most ioctl code is poorly written, and 
causes bugs and special case synchronization problems :)  Driver writers 
love to stuff way too much stuff into ioctls, without thinking about 
overall design.

C++ was never ever meant to work with the kernel.

Its impossible.  If you pass pointers, you need to thunk.  (Not even 
passing pointers via sysfs can avoid this.)  Consider running a 32-bit 
app (with 32-bit pointers and 32-bit ABI) on a 64-bit kernel.

Only for the most simple interfaces.  sysfs is for exporting kernel data 
structures to userspace, using read(2) and write(2).  You can quite 
literally accomplish anything with that.  sysfs could export an event 
directory entry, and a response directory entry.  The response dirent 
could provide all the error reporting you could ever want.  That's just 
a 2-second off-the-cuff example.

This entirely depends on the interface you define.  These problems are 
all surmountable.
Note, I'm _not_ suggesting this is the best route for an SMP interface, 
just stating sysfs generalities.  sysfs is flexible enough that it could 
completely replace SG_IO (though that would not be a wise idea).
