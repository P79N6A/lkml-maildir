How did you implement the write?  At the moment the loop driver gets hold 
of both source and destination pages (the latter via grab_cache_page() and 
aops->prepare_write()) and copies/transforms directly from the source to 
the destination page (and then calls commit_write() on the destination 
page).  Did you allocate a buffer for each request, copy/transform to the 
buffer and then submit the buffer via file_operations->write?  That would 
clearly be not very efficient but given fops->write() is not atomic I 
don't see how that could be optimised further...
Perhaps the loop driver should work as is when 
aops->{prepare,commit}_write() are not NULL and should fall back to 
a buffered fops->write() otherwise?
Or have I missed some way in which the fops->write() case can be 
optimized?
Best regards,
