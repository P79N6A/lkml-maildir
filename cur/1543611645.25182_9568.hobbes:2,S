Hi All,
I have a pseudo-on-topic question:
I would like to have a 64 KBarray (of char), that's trivial, however what
I would like is for the last 4 KB [yes thankfully this is exactly one
page... (assume i386)] to reference the same physical memory as the first
four.
I.e. 16 4KB pages referencing physical 4 KB pages number 0..14, 0.
Is this at all possible? If so, how would I do this in user space (and
could it be done without root priv?)?
Thanks a lot,
Maciej Zenczykowski.
P.S. Yes, this is necessary, otherwise I have to give up on 32-bit access
(switch to 8-bit) and include mod 60KB in every memory access (very random
and I don't think I could predict when no to do this...]
