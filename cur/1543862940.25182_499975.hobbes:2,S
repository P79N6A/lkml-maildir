Sigh, you're right, 2.6.19 messed that up completely.
No, you never had to subtract PAGE_OFFSET from that address
in the past, and you shouldn't have to do so now.
Please revert the offending patch below, and then maybe Franck
can come up with a patch which preserves the original behaviour
on architectures which used to work (e.g. i386), while fixing
it for those architectures (which are they?) that did not.
I guess it's reassuring to know that not many are actually
using mmap of /dev/kmem, so you're the first to notice: thanks.

Subject: [PATCH] Fix up mmap_kmem

[PATCH] Fix up mmap_kmem
vma->vm_pgoff is an pfn _offset_ relatif to the begining
of the memory start. The previous code was doing at first:
	vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT
which results into a wrong physical address since some
platforms have a physical mem start that can be different
from 0. After that the previous call __pa() on this
wrong physical address, however __pa() is used to convert
a _virtual_ address into a physical one.
This patch rewrites this convertion. It calculates the
pfn of PAGE_OFFSET which is the pfn of the mem start
then it adds the vma->vm_pgoff to it.
It also uses virt_to_phys() instead of __pa() since the
latter shouldn't be used by drivers.
