I agree for a product in the hands of a customer:  let the watchdog
pull your bacon out of the fire.
But what about debugging?  Suppose your embedded computer with custom
drivers locks up solid every few hundred hours.  It would be nice if
the watchdog gave a stack dump instead erasing the evidence.  How about
having "action=reset" and "action=debug"?
