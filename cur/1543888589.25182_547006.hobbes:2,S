If his hashing scheme can produce precise locations of where locks are
initialized both by a initializer function or a statically allocated
object then my code is baroque and you should use Peter's code.
I write lockstat without the knowledge that lockdep was replicating the
same work and I audited 1600 something lock points in the kernel to
convert the usage of C99 style initializers to something more regular.
I also did this without consideration of things like debuginfo since
I don't use those things.

Better if I show you the patches in the future instead of saying now.

If it meets your criteria and what you mentioned about is completely
accurate, then use it instead of mine. I'll just finish up what I have
done with reader tracking in my lockstat and migrate my -rt specific
goodies to his infrastructure.
