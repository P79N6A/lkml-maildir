-aa ships with both uml and o1 scheduler. I need uml for everything non
hardware related so expect it to be always uptodate there. However since
I merged the O(1) scheduler there is the annoyance that sometime wakeup
events don't arrive at least until kupdate reschedule or something
like that (of course only with uml, not with real hardware).  Also
pressing keys is enough to unblock it. I didn't debugged it hard yet.
Accoring to Jeff it's a problem with cli that masks signals.
