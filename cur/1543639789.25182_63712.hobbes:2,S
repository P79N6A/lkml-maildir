Alan, please *look* at the patch. The NULL check is already
there, he's REMOVING about 60 lines of duplicated code,
reducing the complexity, and shifting the indirection up one
level to get rid of redundancy.
If you want to delete the NULL check as well, that's fine, but
totally a side issue. Ironically, the very snippet of code you
quoted is all prefaced with "-", no?
