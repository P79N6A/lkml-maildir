Let me qualify that, because it's not 100% fine due to the changes in
PCMCIA land.
Since PCMCIA cards are detected and drivers bound at boot time, we no
longer get hotplug events to setup networking for PCMCIA network cards
already inserted.  Consequently, if you are relying on /sbin/hotplug to
setup your PCMCIA network card at boot time, triggered by the cardmgr
startup binding the driver, it won't happen.
This may affect distributions, and distro folks need to check what will
happen when they upgrade to a 2.6 kernel with this updated PCMCIA
support.
