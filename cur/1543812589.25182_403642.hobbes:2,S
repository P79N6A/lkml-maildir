It could be, but it could also be hardware.
Does the machine survive a night of memtest86?
Please turn on all debugging options in the kernel.
It's extremely unlikely that it's in any way related, but is this the 
machine you reported the psmouse problems for?
Can you find a pattern that triggers the problem with a nearly 100% 
probability? E.g. "24 hours of mplayer fullscreen"?
If yes, check 2.6.16-rc3-g5552 if it really is OK, and then do a binary 
search for the commit that causes your problem.
