Hi all,
I've just ran contest again 2.5.46, 
here the most intersting part of the results:
io_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [3]              461.0   28      46      8       3.66
2.5.44 [3]              371.8   38      37      10      2.95
2.5.45 [1]              396.9   37      36      10      3.15
2.5.45-mcp3 [1]         557.5   25      49      9       4.42
2.5.46 [5]              809.1   20      81      10      6.42
What happened here ?
I'm using an ext3 fs and after the test I got this error message:
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_new_inode: error 28
startx didn't work anymore complaining about fixed font missing...
fsck.ext3 fixed the problem.
I hope it helps.
Ciao,
        Paolo
