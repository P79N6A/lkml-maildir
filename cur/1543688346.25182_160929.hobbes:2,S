Timo, I am at loss. OK, let me put across my understanding of the problem.
Thw writer is *updating* the file and not writing it for the first time,
which means that the file can be 1000 bytes long and the writer might be 
updating bytes 100 onwards. You are worried abt the reader reading 
partially old and partially new data. A question. 
If the writer does not want the reader to read old data why does'nt it 
truncate the file and start writing from the begining every time.
Please correct me if I am missing something significant. All this while I 
was thinking that the writer is writing to the file for the first time. 
i.e as he keeps writing the file size increases, so the reader is sure not 
to read anything else but what the writer writes.
