   Isn't any raid implementation transparent to the filesystem or 
operation system? Certain raid levels can increase or decrease 
performance, but the quantity of i/o operations at the nfs level 
should be the same. At least of successful writes in the filesystem. 
How are you getting those statistics in the Sun machine?
