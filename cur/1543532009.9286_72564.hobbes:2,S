Subject: [BUG] System unusable after wine crash -> Kernel BUG at file.c:69!

Hello,
here's a bug report that I saw since around 2.3.40. It happens when I run wine, and wine crashes, that causes an oops
(see below). Then everything seems ok, but when I try to run any program that lists the processes e.g.. ps,top or some
graphical equivalents they stop responding and I can't stop them with Ctrl-C. When I try to kill them with kill or killall, this
commands stop responding too ( the system goes on quite well, but every time I execute it(ps,top,kill,killall)on a console,
that console hangs and I have to move to another one). Even when I try to halt or reboot clearly (with halt or reboot) the system
is left in an unusable state too, because as soon as init tries to send a SIGTERM to any process, it stops. Then (as I have not
SysRq compiled in) I have to restart hard.
I'm running RedHat 6.1 on and AMD-K6 200 , IDE disk, kernel 2.3.99-pre3
The CallTrace shows, that it has something to do with the fat filesystem, actually Wine did a lot with my vfat filesystem, and that filesystem
wasn't checked for a long time. Maybe there is a corruption on the vfat, that causes this BUG - just a suggestion
The oops following:
