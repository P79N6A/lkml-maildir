Hmmm, linux/irq.h seemed pretty generic. Maybe those other, silly
arches can mend their ways?
Ok, looks like m68k, s390, and sparcx are the only ones not using
irq_desc, and only s390 seems to be far from the irq_desc model. Or I
could be quite mistaken.
I'll be damned if I know what's going on with s390, so I'm not sure
how to get from here to there in terms of coming up with an API for
poking around in ISR lists. Unless you're suggesting I simply make
try_to_find_handler_dev(dev, irq) which seems a little ungainly.
