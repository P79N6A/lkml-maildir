I don't have enough background to judge on the merits of a kernel 
debugger. I simply trust Linus' feelings on the matter.
I don't agree with his arguments on (in)natural selection of rabbits
(ops, kernel developers, I mean).
BTW, a kernel debugger *is* available. And maybe even a more powerful
one will be if Jeff decides to port and publicly release it. Many people
already use kdb, I think, so why don't you just do the same?
