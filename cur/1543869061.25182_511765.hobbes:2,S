Yo,
After some delay[0] I have uploaded a new version of module-init-tools 
to 
http://www.kerneltools.org/
This release mostly has a bunch of build fixes, some memory leakage 
cleanups that will benefit systems that actually run out of memory 
(embedded, etc.) and various other things in the changelog.
I plan on a non-pre release soon but need a bit more time to go over the 
current code and look at the tests, etc. Patches welcome, as usual.
Jon.
