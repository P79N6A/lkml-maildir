I believe the "rw=0" means that was a simple read request, and not a 
read-ahead.
128002016 equals about 62 gigs, which is the correct volume size:
  Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sdb1             62995364   2832696  56962620   5% /xxx
  /dev/sdb1 on /xxx type ext2 (rw,noatime)
I'm at a loss as to why ext2 would want to read 3+ gigs past the end of 
the volume or why the arcmsr driver setting max_sectors to be 4096 instead 
of 512 makes a difference.
Erich, while using 4096 as the max_sectors count, in your lab can you make 
it so ll_rw_blk.c:handle_bad_sector() makes a call to dump_stack() after 
the printk's?  What does it show as the call trace?
