Sorry, I've been too offensive.
IMO, if ext2 is kept separate, the development of it may be focused on 
different user needs than the development of ext3 is focused on.  It's worth 
doing as long as there's someone who will prefer ext2 to ext3 and someone 
who's interested in working on ext2 itself.  That's my point.
