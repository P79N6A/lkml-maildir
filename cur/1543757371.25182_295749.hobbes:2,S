The box seems to work fine; on the other hand, I don't have a mouse or
keyboard plugged in, it's my router machine. (In this particular
instance, I had a keyboard plugged in after I realized I goofed up with
some modules, but generally I don't do that.)

If I have to reboot the box for something, I'll experiment with plugging
in a mouse before loading hostap. (But see below)

It used to be running 2.4.27, where there was no evidence of such a bug
occurring. I'd rather not bother with trying to find out what's going on
if it'll require me to reboot with all sorts prerelease snapshots, since
this is my web server, mail server, etc...
