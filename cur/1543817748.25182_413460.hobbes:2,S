Jake Moilanen had a genetic algorithm autotuner for Zaphod at one time 
which I believe he ported over to PlugSched (as he said he was going 
to).  However, I remove the per run queue statistics that he used to use 
some time ago and he hasn't complained so I've assumed that he's given 
up on it.  I've CC'd him on this mail so he may tell you what's happening.
I could generate a patch to gather the statistic again and make them 
available via /proc if you would like to try a user space version of 
Jake's work (his was in kernel).

PS The reason that I removed the stats gathering is that they add 
overhead which is undesirable if they're not being used so if I put them 
back it would probably be as a build configurable option.
