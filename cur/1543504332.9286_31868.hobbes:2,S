I changed this up slightly to always prefer the first definition,
and since the kernel's symbols are always defined first, this has
the effect you desired.
Using first definition instead of last is how symbol resolution
normally works in linkers.  Doing otherwise is just confusing.
I checked this in to vger's cvs.
