The behaviour originally noted, as per object, slightly changed at least
from 2.6.13-rc3, and still goes on in 2.6.13-rc5, regarding MB ASUS
P4P800-E.
Now ACPI still fail to power off that particular MB and reboots it.
Everything works fine for other MBs we use, e.g. ASUS P5GD1 PRO.
If you need more info, please ask.
Best regards,
