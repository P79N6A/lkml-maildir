Doesn't start with '.' - definitely not an empty directory

OK, it's {'.','\0'}, aka. ".".

Consistency check... Aha, I see. Yup, s/le32_to_cpu/cpu_to_le32/. Doesn't
matter on all normal architectures, but yes, it's still wrong.

If we have it screwed - leave it as is and don't mess with it.
Otherwise - skip this record, it's all right for empty directory.

Starts with '.' and longer than 2 characters? Not empty.

Starts with '.', 2 characters, but the second isn't '.'? Not empty.

Otherwise - skip the record.
	So checks are OK, the only thing being that we should use
cpu_to_le32() instead of le32_to_cpu(). Doesn't affect the behaviour right
now, but ought to be fixed anyway.
