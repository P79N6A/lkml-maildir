I submitted both a parport sharing (i am using interrupt driven parport, 
which is needed due to both serial ports using the same irq) and netmos 
patch a while ago, Tim was concerned about issues encountered 
by folks previously wrt the netmos.
Tests run with this setup was copying a cd from a parport cd drive and 
doing heavy serial i/o on both serial ports. the md5sum on the resultant 
cd image was verified.
