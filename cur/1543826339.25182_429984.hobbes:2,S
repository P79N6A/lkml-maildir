I suspect because it's been like that since for ever, and any time we touch
anything in there, bad things happen.

I don't immediately see anything in there which would prevent us from
running these:
	vfs_caches_init_early();
	cpuset_init_early();
	mem_init();
	kmem_cache_init();
	setup_per_cpu_pageset();
just after sort_main_extable().
But things will explode ;)
I suggest you run up a patch, test it on whatever machines you have, send
it over and I'll do the same.  But please make sure it has a config option
to restore the old sequence for now.  a) So people can work out that it was
this patch which broke things and b) so it doesn't adversely affect testing
of other things too much.
