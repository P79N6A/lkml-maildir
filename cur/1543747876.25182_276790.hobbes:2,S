Hmm, most of the allocations in early init have the GFP_WAIT bit set.
When I block the call to cond_resched() up to cpu_idle() in rest_init()
everything works. Enabling the call to cond_resched() at any place
before brings the problem back.

Yes, the modification are not interfering with your patch. They just add
the accounting of child processes to the selection.

That makes sense, but it does not catch processes forking a lot of
childs, because the allocation rate is not accounted to the parent.

The comment above badness() is the best part of it, especially the
"least surprise part" :)
