Your d_try_drop() does the wrong thing if the dentry is a directory,
didn't have any children but _did_ have a count > 1 - it would drop it
because it didn't check the count for the path where there were no
children. 
Basically, I think you _tried_ to do what "d_invalidate()" already does
(check the latest kernels for some fixes to d_invalidate()).
