	That change alone would result in a setence that
I still would not understand.  Does GFP_KERNEL guarantee address
below 4GB on all architectures?  The GFP_KERNEL mask that currently
includes __GFP_IO, but I'm not sure that that even means "below 4GB"
on all architectures.  If __GFP_IO really does guarantee "below 4GB
and physical = virtual" on all architectures, then it sounds like
I am back to not having to use pci_{,un}map_single in a number of
places in advansys.c, because the Scsi_Request structurs are allocated
with GFP_ATOMIC, which also includes __GFP_IO.

	Just to be clear, I assume that you mean that you cannot
simply cast these virtual addresses to dma_addr_t and that the
underlying physical memory is not guaranteed to be below 4GB,
but that you can use that memory with pci_map_single if your
PCI device can handle 64 bit addresses.
	If I got it right, then here is some proposed replacement
text, to possibly save you a little effort:
| 	You cannot directly use an address in an area returned by
| vmalloc() or kmap(), because these routines are *not* guaranteed to
| return addresses where virtual == cpu memory bus == pci.  You
| cannot even use those addresses with PCI device that only have
| 32 bit addressing, because the underlying physical memory may be
| above 4GB.
|
| 	However, a PCI card that does 64-bit addressing can
| access memory returned by vmalloc or kmap via the dma_addr_t
| address returned by pci_map_single or pci_map_page.
