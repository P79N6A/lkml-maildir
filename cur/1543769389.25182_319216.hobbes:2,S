Hi, Nishanth,
To my uneducated eye, this patch looks like a useful cleaning-up of the
timer API.  I do have one question, though...

It would appear that, depending on where you are, ->expires can be
expressed in two different units.  Users of add_timer() and mod_timer()
are expecting jiffies, but the internal code uses timer intervals.  What
happens when somebody does something like this?
	mod_timer(&my_timer, my_timer.expires + additional_delay);
Might it be better to store the timerintervals value in a different
field, and leave ->expires as part of the legacy interface only?
