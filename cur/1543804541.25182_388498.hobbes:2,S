Have you updated other packages in your system? If you update the kernel, 
you should update the rest of the kernel-related userspace tools (mkinitrd 
is hardly "yet another userspace application"). Debian default kernel
is 2.4 and only provides a 2.6.8-based kernel (2.6.8 was released in august
2004, 17 months ago) as an alternative, and the debian guys put this
in the release notes:
http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#s-upgrade-to-2.6
"[...] Upgrading to a 2.6 kernel from an earlier version is therefore
not a process to be undertaken lightly" and "5.2.4 Switching to 2.6 may
activate udev"
