Argh, that is not true.  That's what I've been trying to explain to
you all along.
The propagation will be done _regardless_ of the flag.  The flag is
only checked for the parent of the _requested_ mount.  If it is
allowed there, the mount, including any propagations are allowed.  If
it's denied, then obviously it's denied everywhere.

No, it does not promise that.  The flag just promises, that the user
cannot _request_ a mount on the parent mount.
