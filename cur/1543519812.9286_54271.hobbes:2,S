Ahh.. but it *is* slightly different..
The old code used to do:
	disable_irq_nosync(hwif->irq);  /* from ide.c:ide_do_request() */
	...
	/* insert code fragment from above */
	...
	enable_irq(hwif->irq);		/* from ide.c:ide_do_request() */
Dumdedum.. I wonder if adding those two lines into
that part of the code cures the problem for those that see it?
If so, then we have a plausable solution.
But the real question for this scenario is,
why is multwrite_intr() reporting an error?
