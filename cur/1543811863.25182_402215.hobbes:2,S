Kai,
I applied the above changes to my scsi_debug (plus
extended .sg_tablesize to SG_ALL (it was 64)) and
my single command READs topped out at 4 MB exactly
(bs=512 bpt=8192). When I tried bpt=8193 the
SG_IO ioctl (via a sg device) yielded ENOMEM which
is much more informative than EIO.
That is an improvement.
