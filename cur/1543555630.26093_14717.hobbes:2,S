This would also make it easier to mount media that only have one
partition. For example, some of my Zip disks have to be mounted as
"sdb", some as "sdb1", and some as "sdb4", depending on what OS
formatted it.
I think this might also be good for multisession CDs, though I'm not
really sure how they are currently handled.

This would require mount to check for a partition table first, since
"hdd" could either mean "hdd as a partitionless device" or "all devices
on hdd". This check could probably even be done in user space, along
with "hyper-mount". Maybe someone has done it already; I'll have to
check freshmeat :)
