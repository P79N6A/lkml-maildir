I don't know for sure, I know for sure with threads faulting on the same
page at the same time is common, but I don't know with processes, I
expected it is possible.

I think so, for invalidate_mapping_pages (the simpler case since it's
less aggressive) we'd need to drop the page lock after increasing the
mapcount, so page_mapped() will notice it has to skip the page.

The only reason for not using semaphores, is to keep the fast path 100%
scalable, without risking cacheline bouncing and without requiring
exclusive access to a cacheline in a cpu (i.e. writes).

I tried that but failed, the reason is that the truncate_count alone is
worthless, we combine the truncate_count with the i_size information and
we write and read them in reverse order to do the locking for truncate.
But invalidates can't change the i_size, so truncate_count alone can't
be used.
I could save 4 bytes by using truncate_count instead of sl->sequence,
but the ugliness of the code that it would have been generated made me
waste 4 bytes.

I wonder if we can use a waitqueue to wait a wakeup from the writer
while still leaving the fast path readonly. In theory yield() should
never trigger, when it triggers it means we had a race condition, but I
also don't like yield. anyway it was pointless to make it more
complicated before hearing some comment, I'd rather not invest too much
time in the seqschedlocks before knowing if they will be used ;).
