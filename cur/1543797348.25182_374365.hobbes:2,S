It seems that I can do
	if (TestSetPageLocked(page))
		schedule_work()
and in this way, avoid the schedule_work overhead for the common case
where the page isnt locked.
Right?
If that works, I can mostly do things directly,
although I'm still stuck with the problem of an app performing
a fork + write into the same page while I'm doing DMA there.
I am currently solving this by doing a second get_user_pages after
DMA is done and comparing the page lists, but this, of course,
needs a task context ...
