Can you elaborate on the dsp card? Is it freely programmable? I'm
working on a project to support this kind of stuff via a
dedicated subsystem for Linux.
The problem is, that it's hard to get access to such cards. So
development is moving very slow :-(

Such stuff is handled already by my subsystem. You just have to
provide some function to do some checks on memory buffers
(readable, writeable, executable, unreachable, properly aligned
and sized transfer unit and so on) and functions for transfers
(which can be sych/asych), ioctls and and debugging interface for
special purposes.

What do you want to do with the buffers? If you plan to expose
them to user space, this is just plain wrong.
If you use it only inside the kernel, please check that you avoid
using more than PAGE_SIZE as rxlen/txlen. Do scatter-gather
instead and vmalloc(). Either in the driver or by hardware
features.
