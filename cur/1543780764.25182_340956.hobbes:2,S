This number is enormously greater than 3, and especially it's
important because the folks who are quite important to kernel
development (read as: Andrew Morton) rely on the build efficiency of
gcc-2.95 so that they can actually get their daily work done.
Some of us spend the majority of our time doing patch applying and
verification kernel builds, and often not much more than that.
Therefore kernel build time is enormously important, and gcc-2.95
is the best option as far as that goes.
