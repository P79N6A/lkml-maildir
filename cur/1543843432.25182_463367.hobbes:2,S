It's utterly sufficient to know about only one person, who have that piece of 
hardware in most cases -- to test the core of the driver, not all specific 
parts. Something like to test it at least roughly.

When akpm proposed this, I agreed (but still have no contacts to post a patch), 
because I needed somebody to test a driver I had rewritten a little bit, but 
there was no place to take a look...
But his thoughts were a little bit different, he considered creating a separate 
file named TESTERS and there have a list of these "qa people" (even for one 
specific piece of hw if necessary). [I hope I did understand him correctly...]
