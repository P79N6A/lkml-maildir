Unfortunately something like a memory scribble often shows up in
kswapd or other code that walks long lists (dcache is another common place
it shows up). I make no judgement either way on the Nvidia driver being a
factor but the report only really becomes really interesting if you can
replicate it without the nvidia driver being loaded that boot.
If this is a one off from a box thats mostly stable anyway it gets tricky
