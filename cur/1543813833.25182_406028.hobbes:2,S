Alan, I've been using your patchset for a while on a small-memory machine with 
an AMD IDE controller, so that the legacy PATA port can be used to run an 
optical drive without bloating the vmlinux size with ide-* (already have SCSI 
built in for usb-storage and SATA). I've not had a single problem to date.
What's your merge plan for the 'complete' drivers? Is it reasonable to merge 
some drivers but not others? (I'm ignorant to your core libata changes, I've 
not yet had a chance to read the patch.)
