The happy theme of today's kvm is the significant performance 
improvements, brought to you by a growing team of developers.  I've 
clocked kbuild at within 25% of native.  This release also introduces 
support for 32-bit Windows Vista.
Changes from kvm-21:
- Significant performance improvements (Anthony Liguori, Eddie Dong, 
Qing He, me)
- Fix longstanding bug: time runs at double speed on x86_64 Linux (Qing He)
- Windows Vista 32-bit support (Qing He, Jun Nakajima)
- Support for kvm abi 10 modules
- Minor updates
Notes:
   If you use the modules from kvm-22, you can use any version of Linux
from 2.6.9 upwards.
   If you use the modules from Linux 2.6.20, you need to use kvm-12.
   If you use the modules from Linux 2.6.21, you need to use kvm-17.
   API/ABI stability is planned for Linux 2.6.22.
