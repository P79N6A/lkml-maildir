Hi There
As part of an assignment I am trying to port a piece of software from 
FreeBSD to linux. Essentially this software (crypto) makes a virtual 
blockdevice with "virtual" sectors on top. Under FreeBSD these virtual 
sectors are just read/written using a simple command:
buf=g_read(dev, offset, len)
error=g_write(dev,offset,buf,len)
In linux however I have only seen the BIO layer which operates on IO on 
hardsector boundaries.
So my question really is, how do I go about updating for instance the 
512 bytes located for at byte 64 to 64+511 on the actual media without 
getting in trouble regarding the data from offset 0-63 and 64+512->1023?
Regards Thomas
