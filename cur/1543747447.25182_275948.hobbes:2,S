When you get to the blue boot screen, just select another boot image
and boot that.
If you have mucked with the original and have no others, boot
from the installation CD. Follow the "repair" prompts. Eventually
your partition will be mounted somewhere and you can fix it.
If you have a seperate /boot partition, just mount that and
rename the file back or edit grub.conf to show the right one
that goes with the right image.
FYI, this is not a kernel problem.
