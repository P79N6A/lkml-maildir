Ok...finally found the thread I was looking for:
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0212.2/0978.html
or look at the "by Thread" page and search for "disable BAR":
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0212.2/index.html
Main difference now is not disabling anything on any sort of Bridge.
Summary: Sizing BARs has never been a very safe operation. We have to
mitigate as best we can and then live with the remaining risks.
cheers,
