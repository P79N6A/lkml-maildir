See Alan Cox's (and my) followup.

So, does it stop working with ac1 or ac2 (as the subject says)?
At least you're apparently using gcc 2.7.2.3 which is good :-)

I think that this message is the most important one. It almost looks
like 'ifconfig ippp0 up' hasn't been done...
Anyway, your best bet is to plug in the CVS version. Get it from
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/v2.2/isdn.tar.gz
 , unpack that
somewhere, run "./std2kern -d -k /usr/src/linux" (or wherever you
keep your kernel source), and reconfigure and build your kernel.
You may also need to rebuild your utils.
