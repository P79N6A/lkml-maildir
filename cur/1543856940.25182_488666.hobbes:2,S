And while we're on the topic of ARM linux toolchain fsckage, it would
be nice to know what patches and incantations are currently
recommended when configuring gcc for building various modern ARM
kernel/ABI configurations (OABI + soft VFP, EABI, etc.).
There has been some discussion on the crossgcc mailing list,
especially around recent compilers and NPTL/TLS, and crosstool has
accumulated some of the relevant patches.  If an expert (i. e.,
someone who has built their own toolchain and gotten an ARM EABI/NPTL
system all the way up) were to reply to this message with some
details, we might be able to coax chip vendors off of hard-float
gcc-3.3/glibc-2.3.x/linuxthreads toolchains.
Cheers,
- Michael
