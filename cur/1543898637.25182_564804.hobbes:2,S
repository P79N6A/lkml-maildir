You persist in evading my point.  I'm not worried about applications;  
I'm worried about drivers.
Let me put it explicitly: You're writing a driver.  You're working on
the read, write, or probe method.  You add code to check if a system
sleep is underway.  Suppose the answer is Yes -- what does your driver
do next?
Make your answer as detailed as you reasonably can.  And be careful to 
arrange things so that an ongoing I/O operation doesn't get messed up 
when your suspend method is called.
