After hearing again last month about how few people actually read every 
lkml thread, I  wanted to point you all at this thread explicitly since 
it seems that we are getting somewhat close to having a forced unmount 
that actually is usable by real applications, something that we seem to 
have been talking about for many years ;-)
With Matthew's original TASK_KILLABLE patch, we have a solution for a 
task read, but still have some holes (fsync & fcntl, others?) that need 
fixed as well for NFS clients.
Is this patch going in the right direction?
