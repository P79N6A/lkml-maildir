Agreed, up to a level.  You cannot let hundreds of gigabytes
worth of memory sit around with (stale) accessed bits set,
and then have to scan millions of pages all at once when free
memory finally runs low.
The amount of CPU time spent in the pageout code at any point
in time needs to be limited.

It is a really big problem for some (fairly common) workloads,
though.
One of the main reasons there has been little activity in this
area upstream is that nobody (at least, nobody I talked to)
had real fixes in mind for the problem.
All we had were workarounds for RHEL, not the kind of real
fixes that are interesting for upstream.
