I am sure it can.  The idea came from customer inputs, speed is my 
guess. echo mem > /sys/../state seems a whole lot simpler and cleaner 
than having userspace figure out what it mounted and then doing echo mem.

solution.

The code "emergency_remount" is almost identical to what we have been 
using. I wanted to reuse existing code rather than dup it.

 From our customer experience, we have not gotten an bad feedback on it. 
  It seems to address there needs.
  In fact we should probably just remove it..

All the code corrects have been address in my upcoming version.
Many thanks for you time and feedback.
