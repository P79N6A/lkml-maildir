In the patch series in -next, it is supposed to replace the list_empty()
logic exactly, as that list goes away in the next patch in the series.
So yes, it is not a "fix" per-say, but would be nice to see if it solves
this issue in some way.
All I can think is that somehow this pci device for the root hub isn't
added to that extra list (as that is only done in the pcibios logic) and
so it isn't set.
I can't get a box here to produce both of those PCI: messages myself,
and neither can Len, so something is really odd here.  And that has
nothing to do with the pci_bus rework, that is just showing the problem
more accuratly now.  Even if it were to be reverted, the root problem
would still be present.
