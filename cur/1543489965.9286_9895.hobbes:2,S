When 2.2.x started, and in the 2.2.0-pre kernels, I also had problems with
IPX, but not with broadcasts. The storm of packets I saw were directed from
my Linux box to a NW file server. I too was using the Olicom token-ring
driver (as I infer from the vendor portion of your MAC address).
I tried to get my box to repeat the symptoms the next day, and it didn't.
Unfortunately, I no longer have access to my box to test it.
There was an IPX broadcast problem reported by an ethernet user, but a
change to how IPX handled netbios broadcasts seems to have fixed that
problem. Perhaps this is an IPX/oltr problem? Is there anyone using oltr,
IPX, and kernel 2.2.x successfully?
