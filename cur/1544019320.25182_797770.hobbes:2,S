Mh, could another solution to this all be to limit the number times
you can add a single epoll descriptor to another descriptor's set?
So you would still get the "upwards cascading" behaviour (i.e. A can
monitor B and C), but the "downwards cascading" would be prohibited
(i.e. B and C can't both monitor A).
I think this is a reasonable alternative, which would again allow a
number of epoll instances limited only by the number of open file
descriptors.
