As you apparently manage the utility, you are at the first place to handle
the incompatibilities as well. Fine :o)

Nonononono. It is just a bit optimistic to hope for an instant solution
here if there has not been one so far on the xfree/friends side. Imo
there are some grey areas:
- what does the common part need;
- who can/want/will do the dirty work.
Looking at the code, there is no instant answer and things won't be set
in stone today. The best you can do is to minimize the pain in the future:
use as few ioctls as possible so that you can control/verify the changes
of interface trough a single point and design this interface so that it
takes into account that things will change. No silver bullet.

Consider reusing these ? It may be a bit academic as you control the main
utility anyway.
