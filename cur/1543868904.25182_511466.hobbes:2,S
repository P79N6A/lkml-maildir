I re-checked the code. And this time, I think cond_resched() is useful
while a kernel is compiled with no full preemption function but only
voluntary kernel preemption is enabled (i.e. CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY
is set but CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set). In this case, kernel performs
scheduling at explicit voluntary preemption points only, and those
points are determined by invoking cond_resched().
But I still have questions, why cond_resched() does not yield no-op
while CONFIG_PREEMPT is set? And why does it deal with the
PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag anyway?
