I didn't say your arguments were convoluted, and I know I didn't mean
to say that.  But I've heard enough arguments about excuses to escape
the obligations of the GPL (and other licenses and obligations, FWIW)
to know that such arguments can get very convoluted.
That said, I was actually trying to quote Eben Moglen, who once spoke
about this, but the word he used was "elaborate", not "convoluted".
Unfortunately, the right word escaped me ATM.

It's no change.  You interpret what's there.  If it's clear, good.  If
there's a dispute, you have to ask the author, only s/he knows what
s/he meant.  It's really that simple.

Why is the burden of the proof on me?
You show me where it says "one may impose restrictions on what
particupar pieces of hardware the program can run", to override the
general spirit of "passing on all the rights one has".

Can't.  These terms wouldn't apply to the copyright holder (the only
person who could make the transfer), only to licensees.

Erhm...  How did you get the (completely flawed, BTW) impression that
tivoization was all GPLv3 was about?
