I found the problem and eliminated it. While this is my own fault, it is
still a bug in either the kernel or the build system: I had CFLAGS set
to "-Wall -O3 -march=native -pipe". I always thought the kernel would
ignore those and set its own CFLAGS, but I was wrong. Either the -O3 or
the -march=native break the build process on gcc 4.2.2.
