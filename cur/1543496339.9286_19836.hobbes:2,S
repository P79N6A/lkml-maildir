Patch for infinitely muted TV-cards
-------------------------------------
Problem:
 The sound of my video board was muted and there was no possibility to
 unmute it, so I began to hack...
 TV-Board: Terratec TV+
 Soundboard: Miro PCM10 (MAD16, for the case this is of any interest)
 Graph.b.: Matrox Millenium G200 (PCI code 0x0521, sits on AGP)
        no Frame Buffer device activated in kernel
        XFree: 3.3.3.1
 Kernel: 2.2.5 and 2.2.8
 Compiler: egcs-2.91.66
Solvage:
  Seems that this patch works around a gcc vs. egcs problem...
  I simply removed the &'s at below "static struct file_operations ...",
  I don't know why both compilers accepted them (shouldn't give back any
  useful information) and why they didn't warn about incompatible
  pointers, even more: why gcc gave the correct pointers...
  My problem: func() is a call, func is the pointer, but &func a pointer
  on a inlined pointer ... still there are wonders and mysts...
  BTW: my congratulations to the author of the VFS, it kept stable even
  with these nifty pointers...
Patches:
  msp3400.patch.kern228 
        a patch againts drivers/char/msp3400.c in the 2.2.8 kernel
  msp3400.patch.064
        against driver/msp3400.c in the external bttv 0.6.4 release
Warning:
  This was the first time I ever hacked into the kernel, although the
  Linux kernel is the most readable code I ever read (and modified) I
  recommend that one of the "gurus" validates my patches.
	happy hacking,
