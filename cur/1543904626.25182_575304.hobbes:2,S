The manufacturer is using a scope to look for RTS and they're not seeing 
it, either.  I just use my eyes to look at the LED, but I can see the 
CTS, DTR, DCD, RD, and TD lights blink, flicker, or dim... (and TD, RD, 
and CTS tend to go on and off rather quickly).
All of that said... even though I don't see RTS flicker or blink or dim 
when using kernel 2.2.5 (RedHat 6.0) I don't have any problems using 
115200 bps DTE-DCE communication rate.
Thanks,
Lee.
