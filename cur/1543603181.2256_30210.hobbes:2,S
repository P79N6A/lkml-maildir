Guess my P3-based laptop doesn't count as modern then:
  0:    7602983          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      10575          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
 11:    1626004          XT-PIC  Toshiba America Info Systems ToPIC95 PCI to Cardbus Bridge with ZV Support, Toshiba America Info Systems ToPIC95 PCI to Cardbus Bridge with ZV Support (#2), usb-uhci, eth0, BreezeCom Card, Intel 440MX, irda0
 12:       1342          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 14:      23605          XT-PIC  ide0
I can't even imagine why they did it like this...
