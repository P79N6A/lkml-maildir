i dont think it's worth doing that. So we should either do the current 
global lock & hash (bad for scalability), or a pure per-CPU design. The 
pure per-CPU design would have to embedd the CPU ID the object is 
attached to into the allocated object. If that is not feasible then only 
the global hash remains i think.
