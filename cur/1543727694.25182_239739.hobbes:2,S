Could we start again this thread in a less polemical way ??
>From my point of view there are two problems:
1- linux device naming
2- linux cd-rom problems (real or not)
1- My experience with unices it's not so long however taking a HP-UX
course I liked very much having tools to scan for new hardware and a
unique device identification numbering however I don't understand why a
single device should have many different devices based on behavior (like
scd0/sg0, raw/not raw, video0/audio for a grabber and so on). A friend
of mine (not a Linux guru but a simple user) simply said "why there are
so many files in /dev ?"
2- since we all use cdrecord (and/or its library) to burn CDs under
Linux if cdrecord do not works under Linux users (me too) thinks that
Linux do not support well cd-burning. So scgcheck has to work. There are
also some recent mail on LKML about cd-burning problems (with firewire
and usb) so there are some problems... I experience "no error" errors
too (so I can confirm it's a real problem).
