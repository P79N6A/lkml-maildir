relayfs actually uses 2 mutually-exclusive schemes internally -
'lockless' and 'locking', depending on the availability of a cmpxchg
instruction (lockless needs cmpxchg).  If the lockless scheme is being
used, relay_lock_channel() does no locking or irq disabling of any
kind i.e. it's basically a no-op in that case.  It's only when the
'locking' scheme is in use that relay_lock_channel() does locking/irq
disabling.  Normally the lockless scheme would be in use - the locking
scheme is there mainly as a fallback, so normally relay_lock_channel()
would indeed cause no locking.
