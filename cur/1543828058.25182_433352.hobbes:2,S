Thanks for explanation. Unfortunately I can't use git:// with "git
pull" (at least in git-1.3.2). First it does some traffic, that
suddenly stops - I guess the server starts doing *something*, perhaps
preparing the update for me or whatnot. After a pretty long while it
sends some more data but in the meanwhile my ADSL router dropped the
NAT entry and git sits on my side waiting for data forever. Recently I
tried the same on a system with direct Inet connection and that worked
just fine.
I suggest adding SO_KEEPALIVE option on the git socket.
