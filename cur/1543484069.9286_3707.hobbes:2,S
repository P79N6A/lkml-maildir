I have usually been compiled unix domain socket as a loadable module and
haven't had any problems so far on an i386 linux with glibc 2.0.7pre6.
After installing glibc 2.0.112, I have noticed that kmod seems to have
some difficulty loading it :
 - the boot process often hangs just where usually unix.o gets loaded.
 - X Window often stops working (I start it running startx from console).
Once unix domain socket compiled in the kernel, the problems seem to have
gone away. Could somebody explain why ?
The attached is a cut-down .config. The kernel is 2.2.1.
