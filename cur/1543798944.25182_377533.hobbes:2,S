Yes, Ingo's code does act like this unfairness.  Interesting also is that
Ingo's original code for his rt_mutexes was fair, and it killed
performance for high priority processes.  I introduced a "lock stealing"
algorithm that would check if the process trying to grab the lock again
was a higher priority then the one about to get it, and if it was, it
would "steal" the lock from it unfairly as you said.
Now, you are forgetting about PREEMPT.  Yes, on multiple CPUs, and that is
what Ingo is testing, to wait for the other CPU to schedule in and run is
probably not as bad as with PREEMPTION. (Ingo, did you have preemption on
in these tests?).  The reason is that if you have a high priority process
release a lock (giving it to a lower priority process that hasn't woken up
yet), then try to grab it again, but a lower priority process was waiting
on it,  the high priorty process would need to schedule out and wait on
the lower priority process. Here's a case of priority inversion that can
be solved without priority inheritance.
The way this situation happens is if you have three processes, A B and C
where A is the highest and C is the lowest.  C grabs the lock and is
preempted by A, A tries to grab the lock and goes to sleep, then B
runs and preempts C (remember, we don't have PI here), and then tries to
grab the lock.  C releases the lock and gives it to A, then A releases the
lock (gives it to B) and then tries to grab it again.
Now you must wait for two schedules and B to release the lock, before high
priority process A gets to run again.
So when we have PREEMPT, your fairness is not being very fair.
