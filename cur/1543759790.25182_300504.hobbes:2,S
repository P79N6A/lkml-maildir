Well, problem is not in bit 6 in IER, but in bit 6 in high divisor byte, as DLAB is set
to one from previous probe.  This simple clear of LCR register fixes problem with (probably
all 16550A) chips being detected as XScale, and in addition to it it does not switch
my 115200Bd serial line to 7Bd mode (0x4001 divisor) anymore.
