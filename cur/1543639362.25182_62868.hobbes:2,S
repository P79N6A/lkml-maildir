You can tell LILO anything you want, but the system will "boot off"
whichever drive the BIOS chooses for reading the MBR. In other words,
unless you diddle the BIOS settings, the LILO MBR (1st level boot) must go
on hda, regardless of where the root filesystem lives.
Yes, I know you can install LILO in a partition, but then you have to
trust whatever MBR the BIOS runs to find it.
This was intended as a clarification of the process, I don't think I am
disagreeing with what you said.
