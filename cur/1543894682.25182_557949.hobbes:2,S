  My fix for this problem is already sitting in Andrew's patch queue
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/11/79
). Rich's patch still has a problem - you
cannot call udf_discard_prealloc() from drop_inode() because it is called
under inode_lock and thus you cannot call e.g. mark_inode_dirty(). I've done
that mistake too ;). So please don't apply the patch.
