Or to quote a little SciFi, in this case Captain Hunt from Andromeda:
Slipstream: it's not the best way to travel faster than light, it's just

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer

cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
