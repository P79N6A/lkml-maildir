I believe that most people use vgacon.  vgacon is not fbcon.  vgacon
writes characters into a character based framebuffer.  fbcon writes
pixels into a pixel based framebuffer.
Therefore, its fine if you've got one of the few cards that fbcon
works with.  Otherwise you're using vgacon, and it doesn't work.
