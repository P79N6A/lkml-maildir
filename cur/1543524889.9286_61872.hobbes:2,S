yep, also with jumbo frames (mtu 9000) there is no problem at all. Eg. the
SysKonnect cards i use do just over 20k IRQs/sec when i'm saturating
107MB/sec TCP bandwith - this IRQ load is simply not a problem at all for
an APIC controller. I've seen IRQ rates of 80k/sec as well.

also other cards are using jumbo frames as well (and it actually makes
sense to increase packet size).
