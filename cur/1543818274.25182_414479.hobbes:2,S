Not that you actually _need_ an IRQ handler to be correct, in any case.

Only using interfaces below the line in spi_bitbang that says
it's the "SECOND PART".

Yes.  Consider several different ways to implement that I/O loop:
	- Interrupt plus two context switches per byte (what you have now),
	  no per-buffer context switch
	- Interrupt per byte, plus one context switch pair per buffer
	  (what I've described)
	- pure PIO per byte, no context switches (as if you polled
	  the registers rather than using an IRQ)
Any of them could be correct, but one of them is a lot worse in terms
of CPU overhead when you aim at tranfer rates of even just a few MBytes
per second.  (It's the one with lots of needless context switching.)
That pure PIO model will sometimes be very appropriate; if the SPI clock
is fast enough, it can be less overhead than the IRQ driven one.
