Everybody who still thinks it's going to be possible to have all possible
drivers in the single package should go to /lib/modules and execute
du -sk */kernel
In my test machine the directory sizes seem to be between 10M and 300M
depending on how the kernel was configured. For the Fedora Core 2 kernels
the sizes are around 25M. When Linux was young it was possible to have the
whole distribution fitted in that  amount of space.
What would the modules directory look like if the next generation devices
get included there too? Or if all the drivers for currently
unsupported defence, telecom, aviation, instrumentation and other special
purpose devices get included in the kernel source tree?
Best regards,
Hannu
