We used to have one for the CREDITS (I think jam - John A Martin) file but 
the maintenance overhead is so small that having a maintainer for it ends 
up being more of a hassle than just not having one at all, and doing it on 
a case-by-case basis.
If somebody who maintains some other thing _anyway_ were to keep track of 
the MAINTAINERS file (the trivial people comes to mind), that might be 
worth it, but in general I suspect it's not a big deal.
