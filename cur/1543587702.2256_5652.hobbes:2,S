Hi,
    This may be harmless but I noticed a warning msg when I went to
2.4.3 on a ISA only 486 mobo.
Feb 18 18:01:41 speedy kernel: ide: Assuming 50MHz system bus speed for
PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
My first thought was to drop idebus to 8Mhz (I think this is the
ISA speed ?),
but using that
Feb 18 18:01:41 speedy kernel: Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=243
ro root=301 BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.3 idebus=8
Feb 18 18:01:41 speedy kernel: ide_setup: idebus=8 -- BAD BUS SPEED!
Expected value from 20 to 66
and then a quick grep/poke in the src gave this
./drivers/ide/ide.c
Version 5.50         allow values as small as 20 for idebus=
and at line 350 it seems that its pci or nothing for the bus speed.
the only deterministic problem (so far that I can directly attribute to
that kernel) with the
2.4.3 booted kernel is that ssh2 locks up for random amounts of time at
randomish intervals.
I can't seem to dig up other info on this problem, I am sorry if this is
the wrong place
to ask. If there are better places to be looking for this data I am
happy to RTFM there.
Now trying 2.4.3-ac6 to see what happens there.
