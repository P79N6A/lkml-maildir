What problem?
All you need is the two existing kmaps, for simultaneous processing of 
input & output data at the page level.
The tweak is linearly generated data fed into this process.  It does not 
need to be kmapped.  It is not discontiguous.  There is no need for a 
third or Nth scatterlist.
Making a generic N-way scatterlist processor is pointless overengineering,
causing new problems with non-trivial solutions, for no benefit
whatsoever.
