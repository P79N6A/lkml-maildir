Subject: any thoughts yet on a "generic" ioctl.h?

  i asked about this a while back, but i still haven't heard a
definitive response as to whether it's acceptable.  that is, extending
the header file "asm-generic/ioctl.h" to allow arch-specific ioctl.h
header files to override what little might need to be changed from the
generic file:

========================================
  from just a cursory examination, the only values that seem to ever
need to be different are the ones mentioned above, which would make
some of those arch-specific ioctl.h files *way* shorter than they are
now.
  is this considered an acceptable kernel programming practise?  or is
it understood that, if an arch-specific header file differs *at* *all*
from the generic one, it will be a *complete* replacement for that
generic version?
rday
p.s.  i haven't looked but i'd have to guess that there are some other
header files that could be modified the same way.
