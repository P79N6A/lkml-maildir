I just had a couple of utterly sick ideas.
Consider this variant (this example is for a 32-bit immediate on x86-64, 
but the obvious macroizations apply):
	.section __discard,"a",@progbits
1:	movl $0x12345678,%r9d
2:
	.previous
	.section __immediate,"a",@progbits
	.quad foo_immediate, (3f)-4, 4
	.previous
	.org . + ((-.-(2b-1b)) & 3), 0x90
	movl $0x12345678,%r9d
3:
The idea is that the instruction is emitted into a section, which is 
marked DISCARD in the linker script.  That lets us actually measure the 
length, and since we know the immediate is always at the end of the 
instruction... done!
