Hi,
Here are 10 different patches, all against a clean 2.6.1.  They update
my previous sysfs class patches (and those should be dropped from the
existing -mm tree).  They fix the race condition in the previous ones,
and add new support for raw and lp devices.
Andrew, can you please add these patches to your -mm tree?  After some
testing there, I'll feel good enough to push them to Linus.
thanks,
greg k-h
