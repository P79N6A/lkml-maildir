I have tried to follow most of the logic and solutions proposed
on this thread. This is the best solution, imo. In fact, I had
already coded something on these lines against a 2.2.10 kernel,
which I still have around. I will try to port this against a 
2.3.19 kernel over the next couple of days and post it for
everyone to review.
Thanks.
