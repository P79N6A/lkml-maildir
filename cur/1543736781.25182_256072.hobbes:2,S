You _do_ see the complexity, you just don't that think it matters.
It forces more complexity on user-space (as least as much as you have
shown) and even more in the kernel (due partly to the current very
simple event code in place that needs the buffer to be a multiple of the
struct size, etc.).
Personally, I don't know if it matters.  John and I have both said that
we will look into going to a dynamic filename.
Also, I am sure that John will take a patch, if you are so inclined.
