Hi!
On athlon desktop:
....
ide: unexpected interrupt 1 15
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ide: unexpected interrupt 0 14
...
hcd.c: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
[hang]
acpi=off fixes it.
On toshiba notebook, boot is broken *only after cold boot*. I can boot
successfully from warm boot.
It says 
ide: unexpected interrupt 1 15
Unable to handle NULL pointer dereference
EIP=somewhere in __ide_end_request. acpi=off does not fix this one.
