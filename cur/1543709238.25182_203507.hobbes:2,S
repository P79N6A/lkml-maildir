Yes, switching from one of 3 choices to the other.  It's not as simple
as 8250 or eth.  It's 8250 or eth or arch for things which don't depend
on other initcalls.
This leads to things in the PPC code like:
#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB_8250
	extern ...
	kgdb_serial = &kgdb8250_serial;
#elif defined(CONFIG_PPC_SIMPLE_SERIAL)
	kgdb_serial = &kgdbppc_serial;
#endif
And then all kgdb_arch_init's have to have kgdb_serial =
&kgdb8250_serial, for it to work prior to the initcall setting it.
