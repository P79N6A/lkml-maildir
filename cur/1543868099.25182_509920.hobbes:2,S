 Well, a glance at your dmesg doesn' show that a minix partition was
recognized. Otherwise it would sow it. So you have not such a
partition within your drives.
You are using an emulator to run minix. You will have the same problem
if you run minix2 or minix3 through an emulator and not from a real
minix2 or minix3 partition.

Daniel
