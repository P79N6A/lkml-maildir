ACK, there has been a number of folks hit by this since I updated
the Fedora rawhide kernel to snapshots including this change.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/beta/show_bug.cgi?id=144480
I've also hit in on my test box that has 256MB.
The pattern so far does seem to be 'no highmem', though
I've not actually tried a recent snapshot on my highmem box.
