I was about to go through the whole kernel base for anti-casting. Sounds 
like a big task, and probably is. I just did not want to do it all at 
once and send a mega-patch. Instead, a per-directory walk seems best to 
me, and granted, "dispatcher events executer hardware namespace" and all 
the other directories under drivers/acpi/ were supposed to be the next 
to be examined for casts.
    Though if you have problems with that because compiling with ugh, 
old or broken, compilers, be my guest.

"""If your compiler requires a cast, you are using a C++ compiler."""
Is that the case?
