wakeup is not a problem: from the kernel's POV, between wakeups the
futex doesn't exist.
The only real case (ignoring the "one thread FUTEX_WAIT while the
other mremaps underneath" which is gonna break anyway), is FUTEX_FD, I
don't see a problem with having to manually move your futex fds in
this case when the memory underneath them has been remapped.  In fact,
it'd be surprising if you didn't have to.

Yes.  Invalidate is nice because it catches a programmer mistake.  But
why not solve the problem by just holding an mm reference, too?
Cheers,
Rusty.
