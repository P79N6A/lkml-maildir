Thanks for reviewing it anyway ;)

RAM based.

Changed. But it will hopefully just completely replace rd.c,
so I will probably just rename it to rd.c at some point (and
change .config options to stay compatible). Unless someone
sees a problem with that?

I've taken most of that stuff out of rd.c in an effort to stay
back compatible. I don't know if it really matters to use long?

Thanks... %s gone awry. Fixed to the expected names.

But only if it's a module?

Back compat. When rewriting the internals, I want to try avoid
changing any externals if possible. Whether this is the Right
Way to do it or not, I don't know :P

Didn't try it, but the rd.c code does the same thing so I guess it
doesn't (or didn't, when it was written).
