That's what I suggested 50 minutes ago :)
As I said, it's a matter of taste. The idea that CONFIG_xxx_MODULE
should be removed from visibility during the vmlinux build is not
limited to myself and Adrian alone. We can revisit it during 2.7
development.
I won't be spending time on it myself at least until after sleep_on() is
already dead, but I'm sure someone will offer it as a 'cleanup'.
