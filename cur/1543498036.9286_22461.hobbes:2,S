These do not perform memory block copy.
insw	inputs words from a port to memory with auto-increment.
insl	inputs longwords from a port to memory with auto-increment.
outsw	outputs words from memory to a port with auto-increment.
outsl	outputs lonwords from memory to a port with auto-increment.
"auto-increment" bumps the memory pointer address by the size of the
memory oprand. It can also decrement if the direction flag is set.
Intel machines have, in addition to memory addresses, ports. Ports
exist in I/O space entirely different than memory space. Many devices
are connected to I/O ports, some to both memory and I/O ports.
