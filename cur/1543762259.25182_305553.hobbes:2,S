You could use
	page-owner-tracking-leak-detector.patch
	make-page_owner-handle-non-contiguous-page-ranges.patch
	add-gfp_mask-to-page-owner.patch
which sticks an 8-slot stack backtrace into each page, recording who
allocated it.
But that's probably not very interesting info for pagecache pages.
Nothing beats poking around in a dead machine's guts with kgdb though.
