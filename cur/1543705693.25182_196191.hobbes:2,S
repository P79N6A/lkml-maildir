I don't quite agree... There are cases for example (USB, Firewire) where
we could construct an OF path to be used by the bootloader setup without
having the OF information in the first place (for devices that weren't
plugged during boot typically). I do no intend to go that way for 2.6
though.
In both cases, we don't "have" the information.
OF doesn't have informations about the linux PCI layout (bus numbering can
be different between OF and linux for example) and PCI doesn't have information
about OF (except that on ppc64, pci_dev->arch_data points to the OF node).
However, the arch code provides a routine that can provide that mapping
PCI -> OF (and in _that_ direction, there is one to go the other way around,
but I hate it, it's not very reliable at the moment, though I could rewrite
it..., and on ppc64, this is the most efficient way too).
It's just about providing a pointer to OF node, not actual informations out
of the device-tree...
Ben.
