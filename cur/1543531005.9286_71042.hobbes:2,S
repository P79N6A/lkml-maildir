[please pardon delays in getting email.  the broken machine is my mail hub
:P and i kinda need it working to get email]
regarding shmem, no, it's definitely not that.
right now i'm down to a few ideas
  - tcp/pipe bug, it is triggered by sending large data bodies over local
sockets.
  - disk buffer bug....i don't really think so but..
  - VIA chipset but related to disk...again, don't think so.
