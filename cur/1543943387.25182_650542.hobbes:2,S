This patchset supports the new IBS profiling hardware available in the latest AMD CPUs in the oProfile driver.
---
These new AMD processors CPUs support Instruction Based Sampling (IBS). See
	 Instruction-Based Sampling: A New Performance Analysis Technique
          for AMD Family 10h Processors, November 19, 2007
          
http://developer.amd.com/assets/AMD_IBS_paper_EN.pdf
for more information about IBS.
IBS support requires changes to the oProfile driver to gather this information and initialize the new MSRs associated 
with these new features.
This patch adds 2 new types of Profiling samples IBS_FETCH and IBS_OP to the per CPU buffers and the event buffers of 
the oProfile driver.
It also adds new control entries to /dev/oprofile to control IBS sampling.
These changes are backward compatible with the previous PMC only version of the driver, and a separate patch is 
available to oProfile 0.9.3 to use this new data.
These changes have been extensively tested at AMD on Family10h systems.
