The VM work has been scheduled to go in for a while.  If you check the TODO
emails from months back, it's always been there.
The VM patch required a lot of work and naturally such a big thing is going to
uncover or trigger other bugs as well as expose bugs of it's own.  It's gone in
so we can find all those bugs and fix them before 2.4 gets released.  In it's
previous state, 2.4 was really bad for VM handling, that would have looked great
for -all- enthusiasts to say "well...sure, 2.2 has better handling, but 2.4 is
out!"  *blink* *blink*
