And the mkdir/chdir interface already exists, see "cd /proc/NNN/root".
There are some small quirks to fix, should we decide that's the way to
go.  But it's basically there.
File descriptors keep track of the namespace (actually vfsmnt) where
they were opened.  Today, if you pass a directory file descriptor from
one process to another, you're granting access to see the other's
namespace.
That's why /proc/NNN/root works (with small fixes) in much the way
you'd expect.
