Hi!
I think you are right about this. There's no way how to fsync directory 
reliably.
My idea is that when the filesystem hits metadata write error, it should 
stop commiting any transactions and return error to all writes.
Write errors don't happen because of physical errors on media --- all 
current disks have sector realocation. Write errors can happen because of 
bad cabling, voltage drops, firmware bugs, corruption of PCI bus by rogue 
card, etc. Most of these cases are fixable by the administrator.
If you continue operating the filesystem after a write error (it doesn't 
matter if you report the error to userspace or not), you are risking 
filesystem damage (for example, cross linked files if there was error 
writing the bitmap) or security breach (users reading blocks containing 
deleted data of other users). If you freeze the filesystem on write error 
and do not allow further writes, the administrator can fix the underlying 
problem and the computer will run without any data damage and security 
problems.
It happened to me just yesterday, my disk was spinning down & up 
repeatedly and returning errors because of insufficient power. My kernel 
kicked spadfs filesystem off on the first write error and didn't allow any 
further commits. I fixed the problem by adding the second power supply and 
connecting some disks to it --- and now, after the incident, there are 
zero corruptions. Just imagine what massacre would happen on the 
filesystem if the kernel didn't kick it off and if it were operting under 
the condition "some writes get through - some not" unattended for some 
time.
