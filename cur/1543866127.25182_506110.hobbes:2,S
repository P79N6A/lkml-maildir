Hello,
 I saw that there is a project in sf.net called Linux Doors.
 (nikitadanilov)
see 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ldoor/
It is from 2001.
The doors in a lightweight and fast IPC mechanism.
It seems to me better (and maybe simpler?) than Unix local sockets or others
podix IPC  (maybe I am wrong) in terms of overhead.
My question is : It seems that the
implementation of doors is not very complex in Open Solaris
Is there a reason that the doors mechanism was not
adopted by the linux kernel?
Regards,
Ian
