Hello,
a short note on that: this proved to be a particularly bad idea back in the
amiga-days. All that happened with this idea (Amiga which has basically only 2
usable interrupts has heavy interrupt sharing) is that every good programmer
told the system that it was not the source of the ongoing interrupt - even if
it was - because otherwise you lost interrupts in heavy-load environment.
Shared interrupts _can_ work well, but you have to do short interrupt-routines
and don't mess the thing by over-intelligent (in fact non-atomic) operation.
Regards,
Stephan
