Would it make sense to label the data (resource) with a list of paths 
(names) that can be used to access it?
Therefore the data would be protected against being accessed via 
alternative arbitrary names. This may be a simple label to maintain and 
(possibly to) enforce, allowing path based confinement to protect a 
resource. This may allow for the benefits of pathname based confinement 
while avoiding some of its problems.
Obviously this would not protect against a pathname pointing to 
arbitrary data…
Just a thought.
