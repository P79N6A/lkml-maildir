Ok, I see.

previous experience.  IIRC, if I didn't have it on /, I couldn't see /usr,
/raid-0, or others (2.4.x).

This worked.  Of course I also removed nohide from / and added the rest of
my FSs.  There were 4 in all on this test machine. / /usr /usr/src and
/home.  All are exported as above except / has nohide removed.

I did not try the patches.  This work around seems to be what I was looking
for.  I'll wait for the patches to be merged.  I did not patch the
nfs-kernel-server either.
I tried 2.6.x as a client to a v2 server running the userland server.  I do
get a ton of nfs not responding messages, but I did a find /mnt/usr on it. 
Doesn't seem to be going into D state this time.
