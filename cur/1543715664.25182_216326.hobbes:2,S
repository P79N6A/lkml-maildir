USB and networks drivers are _actively_ developed by _many_ people
(in comparison to IDE).

It is much easier to pull out network driver from kernel than IDE driver
and some people just won't switch until old driver works.
Just think how much effort it took to make people use ide_cd not ide_scsi
for CD writing and it's nothing compared to make them switch from
(ordered) /dev/hdX to (random) /dev/sdX.
Please remember about device ordering issues and hardcoded 'root=/'.
Not to even mention problems like that SCSI emulation won't some support
some devices supported by ide_floppy and ide_cd etc.

No, the biggest difference is that subsystem core was also changed in ALSA.
-> OSS emulation in ALSA etc.

NO! 8)
The main problem is that even with well tested amd74xx driver for libata
it won't be possible to remove old amd74xx driver so we'll have to maintain
both for really long time and it won't be funny et all.
