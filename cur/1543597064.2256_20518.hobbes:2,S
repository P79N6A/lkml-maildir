While looking through ide-probe.c I came across the following code:
        /*
         * Prevent long system lockup probing later for non-existant
         * slave drive if the hwif is actually a flash memory card of
some variety:
         */
        if (drive_is_flashcard(drive)) {
                ide_drive_t *mate =
&HWIF(drive)->drives[1^drive->select.b.unit];
                if (!mate->ata_flash) {
                        mate->present = 0;
                        mate->noprobe = 1;
                }
        }
In my case I am using a flash card with a normal harddrive as the slave,
but
this code does not allow for that combination. Their must be a better
way to
handle this, or it should at least print, "Flash Disk Detected, Ignoring
Slave"...
