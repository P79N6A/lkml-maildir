I think you can now drop this one.
My "divide error" does not appear in -mm2.
It seems that it is fixed by the following patch:

To summarize, everything seems to now work fine on my Compaq Evo
N600c laptop. Both breakages I was seeing in -mm1 are now fixed:
* the maestro3 divide error does not appear anymore
* I reported a few days ago that my yenta hang was fixed
by pci-yenta-cardbus-fix.patch
Thanks,
Brice
