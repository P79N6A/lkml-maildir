I wonder if this is related to a problem I have noted on some embedded
systems which only have a serial console (no video, and nothing to do with
ACPI).
If I set up the video console (through LILO), and talk to it using minicom
when the machine starts I am first talking to BIOS, that works fine, then to
LILO which also works, then the kernel starts and that works up to the point
where the proper serial console is loaded, when it picks some bizaar baud rate
and only corrects it when setserial is run.
I have recently noticed this on an SC1100 board, but it is not SC1100 specific
as another manufacturers SC1100 based board does not exhibit this behaviour.
Just a thought and probably no help in getting it solved.  Sorry I do not have
any good contacts, although once when I had a problem with serial ports being
misdetected on an IBM MCA machine Alan Cox fixed it for me so he obviously
knows his way around the code and might be able to fix it for us.
