I know that kernel 2.6.6-bk4 works. So were there some memory manager changes
since 2.6.6? If so it looks like there are some bugs. 
On the other hand, ethernet driver should not allocate much memory but rather
drop packets.
Btw, are you using some TCP tweaks? E.g. I have default TCP window size 1MB.
