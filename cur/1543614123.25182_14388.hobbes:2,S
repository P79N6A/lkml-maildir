Some time back, I asked if anyone had any RT benchmarks and got
little response.  Performance (latency) degradation for RT tasks
while implementing new schedulers was my concern.  Does anyone
have ideas about how we should measure/benchmark this?  My
'solution' at the time was to take a scheduler heavy benchmark
like reflex, and simply make all the tasks RT.  This wasn't very
'real world', but at least it did allow me to compare scheduler
overhead in the RT paths of various scheduler implementations.
