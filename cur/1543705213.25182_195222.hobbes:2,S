Please look again. The above trace clearly shows that #31346 has
exited, which is exactly the thread being waitpid()ed for.
What the program does is basically
- spawn four threads or so
- each thread forks off some process, and then waitpid()s for exactly
  that pid
... and all but the last waitpid() never returns even though all four
child processes have exit_group()ed.

No SIGCHLD has been installed. (I checked the strace output.)
