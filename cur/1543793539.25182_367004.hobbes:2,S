Which is why ndiswrapper needs to get fixed to work with 4K stacks. 
ndiswrapper is the thing that's doing the wierd stuff, it needs to adapt 
to the kernel, not the other way around. The reasons to use 4K stacks 
are strong enough that they are not made up for by the fact that 
ndiswrapper currently would like to have more stack space.
Windows apparently has 12K of kernel stack for drivers.. in that case 
even 8K of stack in Linux would not necessarily be enough. If 
ndiswrapper wants to run Windows code in the kernel with any amount of 
reliability it should be providing its own stack which is the size that 
the code expects.

How do you know this is related to the stack? Did you report this as a bug?
