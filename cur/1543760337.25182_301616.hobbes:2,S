Ok, here it is.
Dominik can you try the attached patch and see if it solves the problem?
It it does, I'll do a correct [PATCH] post later with all the 
signed-off-by and subject and stuff.
Please make sure you test with the same configuration that produces the 
error, because this is a pretty hard to hit bug. The needed conditions are:
  - 'nm' changes the order of 2 aliased symbols from the 1st to the 2nd pass
  - one of those symbols get sampled for token optimization. With your 
configuration the sampling was about 1 out of 12.
  - the difference in the name of those symbols makes the algorithm 
select different tokens. As 1024 symbols are used to produce the tokens, 
changing just one of these symbols can easily go unnoticed.
  - the difference in the tokens selected makes the size of the 
compressed data change, so that it goes above (or below) an alignment 
boundary. In your case it only changed 2 bytes in size, but it crossed a 
4 byte alignment boundary.
With your .config file but a different set of tools (gcc, binutils 
versions) I couldn't trigger the bug in my machine.
