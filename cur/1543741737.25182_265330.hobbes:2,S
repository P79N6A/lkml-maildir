Yes, I think it is the most reliable way because the measurement is done
in the kernel.  At least, this is what AM's notes say.  There are any
number of ways to generate these with userspace programs (jackd,
realfeel, etc).
Here is a more up to date version of the rtc-debug patch:

There is still a bit of 2.4 cruft in there but it works well.  Maybe
this could be included in future patches.
