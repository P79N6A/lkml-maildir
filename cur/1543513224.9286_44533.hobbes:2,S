The problem is that most people compile without CONFIG_RTNETLINK 
ATM, and iproute2 needs rtnetlink. Before converting ifconfig into a 
wrapper for ip you would need to teach ip to fall back to the old
ioctls for configuring basic things like ip addresses, and this would
not fit very well into the iproute2 structure. 
I think it is better to keep them separated, and have the ugly 
ioctl/setsockopt stuff in nettools and keep it functional as fallback
ad for compatibility.
Also, If rtnetlink was made a standard part of the network core (required
for full migration to ip2) lots of people would complain about the bloat.
