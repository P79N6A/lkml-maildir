Hi, I would like to know whether following limits are right for kernel
2.4.x:
Max. N. of CPU:			32	(SMP)
Max. CPU speed:			> 2 Ghz	(up to ?)
Max. RAM size:			64 GB	(any slowness accessing RAM over 4 GB
					 with 32 bit machines ?)
Max. file size:	 		1 TB	(?)
Max. file system size:		2 TB	(?)
Max. N. of files per FS:	2^32	(depending on max. n. of inodes ?)
Max. N. of users/groups:	2^32	(well, that's in theory, probably 						
practical limits, due to RAM usage,
					 access time, etc., are much lower).
Other upper limits, eventually compared with those of latest 2.2.x
kernels, would be appreciated.
	Thanks in advance for your patience.
