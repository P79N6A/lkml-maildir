GNOME and KDE run on operating systems that run other kernels than
Linux, hence they have to implement their own userland VFS anyway.
Adding this to the Linux kernel won't help them one bit, unless
we can magically convince Sun to add it to Solaris, all different
BSD:s to add it to their kernels, etc.  Not going to happen.
An effort to get GNOME and KDE to unify their VFS:s would be
far more benificial, and would if successful probably lead to
other desktop environments (if there are any other DE:s with their
own VFS:s, dunno about that) following their lead.
FreeDesktop is doing a lot of work to make GNOME, KDE, and other
DE:s interoperate as much as possible.  Support their initiative
instead of trying to get a monstrosity (albeit a very cool one,
conceptually) into the kernel.  Sure, it could be made to work,
but not without dropping our Unixness.  And if we do, we should
start by looking at Plan 9 =)
