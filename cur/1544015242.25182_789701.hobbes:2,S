Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Convert '/' to '!' in dev_set_name()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Commit 3ada8b7e ("block: struct device - replace bus_id with dev_name(),
dev_set_name()") deleted the code in register_disk() that changed a '/'
to a '!' in the device name when registering a disk, but dev_set_name()
does not perform this conversion.
This leads to amusing problems with disks that have '/' in their names:
for example a failure to boot with the root partition on a cciss device,
even though the kernel says it knows about the root device:
    VFS: Cannot open root device "cciss/c0d0p6" or unknown-block(0,0)
    Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
    6800        71652960 cciss/c0d0 driver: cciss
      6802               1 cciss/c0d0p2
      6805         2931831 cciss/c0d0p5
      6806        34354908 cciss/c0d0p6
    6810        71652960 cciss/c0d1 driver: cciss
Fix this by adding code to change '/' to '!' in dev_set_name() to handle
this until dev_set_name() is converted to use kobject_set_name().

OK, this is tested to work on my system as well.
