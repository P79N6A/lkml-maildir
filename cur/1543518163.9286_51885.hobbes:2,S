Yes, tune2fs will have this.

Yes.  You will be able to remove the journal and add a new,
differently sized on.  You will have to have the filesystem unmounted
to do this, though.

There is already a range of inode numbers which e2fsck treats as
reserved.  e2fsck will also have to be taught about journal recovery,
but all that will come.
