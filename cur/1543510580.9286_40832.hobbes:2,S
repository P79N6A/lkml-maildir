mtrr.c is not really using a spinlock, it's abusing try_spinlock to
implement a semaphore. It's safe to call smp_call_function() with a
semaphore held.
Calling schedule() (from within process in TASK_RUNNING state) is
dangerous if the process is RT, it can lead to lockups. I've already fixed
this in my tree.
