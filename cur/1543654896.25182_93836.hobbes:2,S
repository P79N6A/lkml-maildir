Minor 0 is dynamic - you probably want to pick another minor number or
look in /proc/misc to see which minor was chosen.
The PS/2 port is rather special btw and tied in with the keyboard so
isnt one you can treat seperately. Fortunately no PS/2 mouse should need
any 2.4 kernel hacks, just user space stuff to handle different command
streams
