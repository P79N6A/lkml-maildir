Subject: workqueue cmpxchg() breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The changes in 365970a1ea76d81cb1ad2f652acb605f06dae256 result in
cmpxchg() being invoked with bogus sizes with gcc-4.1 on SH, particularly
when kernel/workqueue.c:set_wq_data() is left inlined:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
kernel/built-in.o: In function `__cmpxchg':
/home/pmundt/devel/git/sh-2.6/include/asm/system.h:247: undefined reference to `__cmpxchg_called_with_bad_pointer'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
If I add a handler for the u64 case, that catches one of the inlined
references, but the other call site generates something completely different,
it's garbage in either case.
Taking set_wq_data() out of line fixes this, but is likely not the right fix.
