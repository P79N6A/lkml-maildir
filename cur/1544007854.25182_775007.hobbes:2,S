It's the historical git tree.  All the pre-2.6.12 history which was
migrated from bitkeeper.  
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git
Spending a couple of fun hours reading `git-log mm/vmscan.c' is pretty
instructive.  For some reason that command generates rather a lot of
unrelated changelog info which needs to be manually skipped over.
