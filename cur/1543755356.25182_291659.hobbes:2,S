pci_read_config_dword lands in arch specific code.
See drivers/pci/access.c:PCI_OP_READ() macro.
I'm missing what pcibios_exp_cfg_space() does that can't be handled by
the bus_ops supplied by pci_scan_bus().
I would expect the pci_read_config_dword to fail for being out of bounds.
Is that wrong?
Or is bus_ops not feasible in this case because pcibios needs access
to pci_dev?
If it's feasible, maybe the right place to add this hook is to
pci_read_config_dword which is also handed the pci_dev. And add
another function pointer to bus_ops (which could be NULL) to check
chipset support for Expanded Config space before calling
pci_bus_read_config_dword. Thats cleaner than adding a hook
before each use of pci_read_config_dword.
hth,
