Using the version of mount from util-linux-2.11n: 
Staticly linked vs glibc 2.2.5:
    $ ls -l ./mount
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 andersen andersen   533912 Aug 13 03:41 ./mount*
Staticly linked vs uClibc 0.9.14:
    $ ls -l ./mount
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 andersen andersen   115844 Aug 13 03:40 ./mount*
Busybox mount w/NFS enabled, statically linked vs uClibc 0.9.14:
$ ls -l ./busybox
-rwxr-xr-x    1 andersen andersen    62628 Aug 13 03:46 ./busybox*
And uClibc's RPC code accounts for 33k of the 62k...

I would love to see an example of how to do an NFS mount w/o
resorting to the C library at all.  Plainly, having generic RPC
code in the C library sucks, even if you trim it down.  Having
the entire NFS mount process live in application space, and not
in the C library, is clearly a win....
