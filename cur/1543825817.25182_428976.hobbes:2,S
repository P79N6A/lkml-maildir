It's coming from Kaneshige-san's patch:
pci-legacy-i-o-port-free-driver-changes-to-generic-pci-code.patch
This patch assumes that pci_request_region() will always be called
after pci_enable_device() and pci_release_region() will always
be called before pci_disable_device(). We cannot make this
assumption,since it's perfectly legal to disable a device
first and then release it's regions. So, I think that patch
needs to change.
thanks,
Rajesh
