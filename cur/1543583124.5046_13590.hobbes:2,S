Could you double check the code in tulip_core.c, around line 1450?
IMHO it's bogus.
1) if the network card contains multiple mii's, then the the advertised
value of all mii's is changed to the advertised value of the first mii.
2) the new driver starts with the current advertised value, the previous
driver recalculated the value from mii_status
[ mii_status = tulip_mdio_read(dev,phy,1); ]
- reg4 = ((mii_status>>6)& tp->to_advertise) | 1;
That could trigger 2 problems:
* I tested with 'options=11', and the new driver announces '100baseT4'
support, but the PHY doesn't support 100baseT4.
* If the mii is incorrectly initialized, then a wrong advertised value
is not corrected.
