I had a mail exchange with gooch. devfs does solve the problem for todays
local drives
and controllers. whereas the problem comes up when your discovery order
changes. 
eg: you have a controller on a SAN, and say host monitors and gets the
controllers in a different order, devfs will also switch since now the
host0, host1 etc are not the same as last reboot. 
the issue also exists for new hot plug PCI, if i add a additional s pci scsi
card, the next scan may give it a different discvery order. Beleive for some
reasons like that, 
solaris for eg: have complete paths including bus, dev etc in the devfs
path.
I would also like to thank Richard Gooch for his clean cur unamiguous
answers. 
Its a lot of good work that needs to get in main kernel soon.

This RIGHT answer. Or rather "this is right half of answer". See below.

And what you can do if you DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH to address _data_ on the disk
?
How you can mount MO or ZIP this way, for example ? You should write label
on every ZIP and every MO-disk ??? Gosh.

Ok. HOW, JUST HOW you can mount by volume identifier when you just DO NOT
KNOW
that volume identifier ? Typical situation for removable media by the way.
Of course in perfect world every such medium will have label printed in that
medium... We live in real world, unfortunatelly... I've NEVER seen CD's
where
information about label is printed on cover: you should mount it to find
out.
And with you proposam you should ALREADY know what's number is to mount
it...
P.S. When you know UUID it's can be enough. You just not always have such
information...
