A) This is only true for obsolete hardware.  Can you name an example that's 
currently being manufactured?  (I'm trying to figure out if serial mice 
count, not that you really need kernel support to detect those.)
B) You can insmod the module from userspace to actively probe for stuff.  If 
the kernel doesn't know either until it probes, and you can trigger the probe 
at will, what additional kernel support do you need?
