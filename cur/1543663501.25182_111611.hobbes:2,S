before anything else, thanx for the response, i was very much discouraged 
by the fact that i did not get any replies...
coming to whats happening...  lets see it this way... Theres a process (x)  
that is migrated to some other node. Now any syscall that the process (X)  
makes is to be shipped back to the originating node.  Say i have a user
thread (Y) running and receiving requests for syscall executions.  And now
if i execute a syscall, the syscall will be executed as of (Y) is 
executing it, but i want the syscall to run as if (X) is executing it!
The process (X) still exists on the originating system, but is idle.
Someone please help me out!
Prasad.
