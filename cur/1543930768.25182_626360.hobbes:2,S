I pulled from your tree to look over the patches, and noticed that it 
looks like several commits were merged improperly.  It looks like they 
were auto merged or something from an email, and the commit message 
contains the email headers, rather than just the commit message in the 
body.  This leads to the shortlog showing entries that start with 
"Return-Path:".
I was hoping to find at least some initial information on the overall 
design in Documentation/ but don't see any.  Have you written any yet 
that I could take a look at elsewhere maybe?
Some of the things I was trying to figure out is does each syslet get 
its own stack, and schedule only at a few well defined points, and if 
so, would it then be fair to characterize them as kernel mode fibers?
