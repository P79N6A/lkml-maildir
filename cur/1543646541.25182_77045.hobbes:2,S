What I would like to see is a 'linux-commits' mailing list where
Woodhouse's per changeset diffs can all be posted.  Refreshing the webpage
over and over waiting for new patches isn't fun.  And that info can't be
fingered for.
I appreciate that he does it.  It's a nice service he provides.  But I'm
sure Linus could write a script that mails 'linux-commits' with a diff
for each changeset easily.
