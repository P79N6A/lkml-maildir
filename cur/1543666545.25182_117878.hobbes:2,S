The mmap() syscall only sets up the VMA info, it doesn't
fill in the page tables. That only happens when the process
page faults.
Note that filling in a bunch of page table entries mapping
already present pagecache pages at exec() time might be a
good idea.  It's just that nobody has gotten around to that
yet...
