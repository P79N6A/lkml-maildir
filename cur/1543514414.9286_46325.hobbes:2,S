After making that post, I got the same hangs with pre15, 2.2.5, and
2.0.38, and various BIOS and Linux APM settings. 
Then I pulled out the second video card (S3 Trio64 PCI), and ran
2.2.13pre17 in text mode until the X server for the on-board i810 AGP chip
magically appeared.  That ran for about a week, much longer than it had
lasted previously, without any problems.  (Until my roommate kicked the
plug out of the wall, anyway)
That exact card had worked for three years on my old machine (2.0.0 -
2.0.3x) with no problems.
I don't know how helpful this is, but if anyone wants to investigate
whether Linux isn't handling this case correctly as opposed to it being
completely a hardware problem, I'd be willing to try patches and other
configurations.
