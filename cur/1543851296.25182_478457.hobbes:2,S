Currently we have 3 type of functions that works with dentry_unused list:
1) prune_dcache(NULL) -- called from shrink_dcache_memory, frees the memory and
requires global LRU. works well in current implementation.
2) prune_dcache(sb)  -- called from shrink_dcache_parent(), frees subtree, LRU
is not need here.  Current implementation uses global LRU for these purposes, it
is ineffective, and patch from Neil Brown fixes this issue.
3) shrink_dcache_sb() -- called when we need to free the unused dentries for
given super block. Current implementation is not effective too, and per-sb LRU
would be the best solution here. On the other hand patch from Neil Brown is much
better than current implementation.
In general I think that we should approve Neil Brown's patch. We (I and Kirill
Korotaev) are ready to acknowledge it when the following remarks fill be fixed:
- it seems for me list_splice() is not required inside prune_dcache(),
- DCACHE_REFERENCED dentries should not be removed from private list to
dentry_unused list, this flag should be ignored if the private list is used,
- count argument should be ignored in this case too, we want to free all the
dentries in private list,
- when we shrink the whole super block we should free per-sb anonymous dentries
too (please see Kirill Korotaev's letter)
Then I'm going to prepare new patch that will enhance the shrink_dcache_sb()
performance:
- we can add new list head into struct superblock and use it in
shrink_dcache_sb() instead of temporal private list. We will check is it empty
in dput() and add the new unused dentries to per-sb list instead of
dentry_unused list.
thank you,
