The device was recognised, but insertion of a card was effectively not being
noticed, with no messages in the kernel log. (I say 'effectively': interrupts
were definitely being received and processed.)

I have now... bits 4 to 7 are ignored, so 0x0F is fine; and it's what's
needed since lower values don't work.
It turns out that the reader only supports one voltage (caps &
SDHCI_CAN_VDD_330 is true, the others are false) and the code was already
selecting the correct value for the hardware. So I tried reverting the patch
and ensuring that the first writeb() in sdhci_set_power() isn't done if the
second one will be - and things started working properly again.

Sent as a follow-up to this message.
(BTW, is there a version of Thunderbird which preserves Mail-Followup-To in
followups? I ask because I see that that header got lost...)
