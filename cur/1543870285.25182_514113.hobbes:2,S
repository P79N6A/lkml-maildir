I've added some printks to show exactly what happens (see below).
Since calc_load() appears to be run as often as possible, would it be ok to 
move it to run half a second out of step from rounded jiffies? Its count 
value is initialised to LOAD_FREQ so it would be easy to add HZ/2.
Otherwise every process using round_jiffies to 1s (1.00), 2s (0.50), 
3s (0.33), 4s (0.25), 5s (0.00 or 1.00) could affect the load average in a 
constant way. (Beyond 10s the effect is unlikely to be noticed).
After a while of this (~3min):
[  192.147049] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=4294832000
[  192.151319] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=4294832004, next=996
[  192.463459] calc_load(27), count=-20, jiffies=4294832316
[  192.463472] calc_load(27), count=4980, jiffies=4294832316
Jiffies wraps:
[  327.121469] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=4294967000
[  327.139428] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=4294967018, next=1000
[  327.437739] calc_load(27), count=-20, jiffies=20
[  327.437750] calc_load(27), count=4980, jiffies=20
The next run occurs during cxacru_poll_status:
[  332.416288] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=5000
[  332.417312] calc_load(1), count=-1, jiffies=5001
[  332.417322] calc_load(1), count=4999, jiffies=5001
[  332.423382] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=5007, next=993
This happens without fail until I reboot:
[  672.350970] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=345000
[  672.351913] calc_load(1), count=-1, jiffies=345001
[  672.351926] calc_load(1), count=4999, jiffies=345001
[  672.367737] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=345016, next=984
It's interesting that calc_load() is run most of the time 19ms later (count=-20) than usual until jiffies wraps, then it runs on time or 1ms late (count=-2). Full log available on request (75K), HZ=1000 with NO_HZ.
