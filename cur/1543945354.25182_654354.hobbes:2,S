There isn't much point in the RDMA layer subscribing to mmu
notifications
if the specific RDMA device will not be able to react appropriately when
the notification occurs. I don't see how you get around needing to know
which devices are capable of supporting page migration (via
suspend/resume
or other mechanisms) and which can only respond to a page migration by
aborting connections.
