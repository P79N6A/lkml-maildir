+Macintosh HFSPlus Filesystem for Linux
+======================================
+
+HFSPlus is a filesystem first introduced in MacOS 8.1.
+HFSPlus has several extensions to HFS, including 32-bit allocation
+blocks, 255-character unicode filenames, and file sizes of 2^63 bytes.
+
+
+Mount options
+=============
+
+When mounting an HFSPlus filesystem, the following options are accepted:
+
+  creator=cccc, type=cccc
+	Specifies the creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder
+	used for creating new files.  Default values: '????'.
+
+  uid=n, gid=n
+	Specifies the user/group that owns all files on the filesystem
+	that have uninitialized permissions structures.
+	Default:  user/group id of the mounting process.
+
+  umask=n
+	Specifies the umask (in octal) used for files and directories
+	that have uninitialized permissions structures.
+	Default:  umask of the mounting process.
+
+  session=n
+	Select the CDROM session to mount as HFSPlus filesystem.  Defaults to
+	leaving that decision to the CDROM driver.  This option will fail
+	with anything but a CDROM as underlying devices.
+
+  part=n
+	Select partition number n from the devices.  This option only makes
+	sense for CDROMs because they can't be partitioned under Linux.
+	For disk devices the generic partition parsing code does this
+	for us.  Defaults to not parsing the partition table at all.
+
+  decompose
+	Decompose file name characters.
+
+  nodecompose
+	Do not decompose file name characters.
+
+  force
+	Used to force write access to volumes that are marked as journalled
+	or locked.  Use at your own risk.
+
+  nls=cccc
+	Encoding to use when presenting file names.
