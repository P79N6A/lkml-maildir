The patch has updates for the ATI Rage 128, Control, and Platnium 
framebuffer driver. The Radeon patch adds PLL times for the R* series of
cards. Memory is now safe to allocate for the software cursor and inside 
fbcon. There still are issues with syncing which cause the cursor on some 
systems to become corrupt sometimes.
