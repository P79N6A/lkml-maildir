When there are exist userspace solution - yes.

Where is your userspacesolution to handle 64 Gigs or RAM ?

The same.

When you'll show way to use x86 kernel on Sparc, Alpha and so all that can
be safely removed...

And all such things donothave userspace solutions. When clean enough userspace
solution is there (like rarpd) feature is usually removed from kernel.

Linus do not care :-)

Sadly... Of course if can show way to pull out that code in userspace it'll be
done for sure.

They ARE. You can do what you want from userspace. You can not support obscure
CD-ROM's, 64GiB RAM, etc. in sane way without kernel modifications. If (and
ONLY if!) some obscure feature for embedded system can not be done outside of
kernel in sane way it'll be included. But you should at least consider ALL
known userspace solutions and show how they ALL are failing to fill the
bill...
