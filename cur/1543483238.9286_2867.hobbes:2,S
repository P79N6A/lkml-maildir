works here, too (less version 332). But I think the problem used to be that
old versions of less did a stat and got the file size a priori.
Since all files in /proc have a file size of 0, this caused problems.
I'm guessing actually, but I remember writing a userfs based thing in
my freshman year, which would do on-the-fly decompression of gzip'ed files.
cat file|less worked, but less file would truncate. That was because I was
returning the compressed size on stat()ing.
