Subject: e100 NETDEV WATCHDOG transmit timeout since 2.6.4

Hi,
Since 2.6.4 my ethernet interface is timing out after successfully
operating for 30 minutes or so, and is reset by the watchdog and runs
for another 30 minutes or so. This behaviour is only since 2.6.4 when I
believe a rewrite of the code was done. I've tried it with acpi
disabled, and got the same results if this helps.
Anybody got any ideas?
Cheers,
Eamonn
