So the VM system should inform it.  The way to do that is to convey a 
sense of cache pressure that is in proportion to the size of cache used 
by that cache submanager, and then the cache submanager has to react 
proportionally.
If every write page is consider a pressure increment, and if the page is 
marked accessed, then proportional pressure is achieved.

I agree, except that using writepage is what Linus wants, and except for 
the DMA bug Rik mentions, it should work.  It would be nice if the VM 
maintainers were to comment writepage so that other filesystems could 
know how to use it (and fix the DMA bug Rik mentions).
