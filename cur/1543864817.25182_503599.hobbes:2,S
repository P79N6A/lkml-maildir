Can read_proc still be executing when remove_proc_entry returns?
In my driver [*] I allocate some data and create a proc entry using
create_proc_entry.  My read method reads from my allocated data.  When
shutting down, I call remove_proc_entry and immediately free the data.
If some call to read_proc is still executing at this point then it will
be accessing freed memory.  Can this happen?  I've been rummaging around
in fs/proc to see what prevents it, but didn't find anything yet.
Thanks a lot,
Duncan.
[*] Actually it's the ATM layer that does all this (net/atm); my driver
uses that layer.
