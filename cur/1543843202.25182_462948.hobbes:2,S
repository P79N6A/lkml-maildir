On my box the issue (the second suspend of USB controllers in a row fails
100% of the time) went away after I had reverted the following patches
(I'm using 2.6.18-rc6-mm2 now):
fix-gregkh-usb-usbcore-add-autosuspend-autoresume-infrastructure.patch
gregkh-usb-usbcore-add-autosuspend-autoresume-infrastructure.patch
gregkh-usb-usbcore-non-hub-specific-uses-of-autosuspend.patch
gregkh-usb-usbcore-remove-usb_suspend_root_hub.patch
Greetings,
Rafael
