No comment on struct dma_scatterlist, but the above is the most natural 
API for audio drivers at least.
Audio drivers allocate buffers at ->probe() or open(2), and the only 
entity that actually cares about the contents of the buffers are (a) the 
hardware and (b) userland.  via82cxxx_audio only uses 
pci_alloc_consistent because there's not a more appropriate DMA 
allocator for the use to which that memory is put.
Audio drivers only need to read/write the buffers inside the kernel when 
implementing read(2) and write(2) via copy_{to,from}_user().
