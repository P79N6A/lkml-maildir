Strange question.  Because all the pages are in use for something else.

You're proposing that for memory hot-unplug, we take a single zone and by
some means subdivide that into sections which correspond to physically
hot-unpluggable memory.  That certainly does not map onto MAX_ORDER
sections.

Memory hot-unplug, of course.

So you're proposing that we take a single zone, then divide that zone up
into two sections.  One section is non-hot-unpluggable and is for
un-moveable allocations.  The other section is hot-unpluggable and only
moveable allocations may be performed there.
If so, then this will require addition of new infrastructure which will be
to some extent duplicative of zones and I see no reason to do that: it'd be
simpler to divide the physical memory arena into two separate zones.
If that is not what you are proposing then please tell us what you are
proposing, completely, and with sufficient detail for us to work out what
the heck you're trying to tell us.  Please try to avoid uninformative
rhetorical questions, for they are starting to get quite irritating. 
Thanks.
