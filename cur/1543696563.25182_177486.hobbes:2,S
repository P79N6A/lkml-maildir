Yes you can do it.
You need a 2.6 kernel.  And it's best to use something other than the
MSDOS partition format --- I suggest you use parted to create a GPT
partition table (which means compiling your kernel to understand that
format).
You didn't say what architecture you're running on.  If it's a 64-bit
system you don't have to do anything else.  If it's a 32-bit system,
then turn on CONFIG_LBD when you compile.
