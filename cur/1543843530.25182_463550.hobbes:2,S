Yes, it's expected, but no, I agree it would be nice to not break
existing setups.
Care to send me an output of 'lspci -tv' and dmidecode (the first 80
or so lines)?
I think I'll redo this patch to keep the 2.6 depth-first sort order as
default, with command line options "pci=bfsort" and "pci=nobfsort" to
force it one way or the other, and DMI table entries for Dell's newest
systems that should default to bfsort.
Pierre, thank you for you report and your time to do the bisect.  I
apologize for any inconvenience this caused you.
Thanks,
Matt
