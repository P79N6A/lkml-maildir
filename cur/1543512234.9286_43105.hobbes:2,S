And it works for no devfs _without_ touching any /etc/rc.d files at
all. Why do work when none is enough?

OK, agree on a standard then. UUIDs work with IDE, SCSI, ... for disks. OK,
done. Network doesn't need /dev entries. DOne too. Sound needs different
files because devices are different, a dynamic filesystem papers over that
but doesn't allow me to use any program with any device. Then unify the
device nodes.
And dynamic filesystems cease to be a solution at all, because the problems
have been solved...

Maybe. What is questioned is that it may very well not be the best solution
in many cases, and isn't by far in the cases bandied around here.

"rm /dev/hda5" doesn't work; neither does "chmod g-w /dev/fd0".

OK, that is common ground where rational discussion can take place. Why?
BTW, "permanent permissions" are given.

OK, how many _different_ kinds of devices do you plug into it?

Again, how many _different_ kinds of devices will I be using simultaneously
on it? What kind of iBook devices plug themselves in, just by themselves,
and get instantly useable without any user intervention?

Irix does it, Solaris does it too, ... I know the Solaris one, and don't
like it: You must reboot to get new devices attached. Also, devices change
their names if I move them around. Kernel mechanism itself seems quite
minimal (run a couple of userspace programs on startup when given '-r', no
big deal). Sure, /dev is uncluttered. As long as you remember doing the
'-r' each time. I just load up the machine, do the '-r' thing and forget
about it. A few files too much inside /dev (where I rarely go) isn't a big
deal. Besides, it is the easiest way to get persistence.

Strange. I've been running OSS on my PC for quite some time, no problems
there. No devfs in sight, done it way before devfs was dreamed up even.

All devices 000 by default? What is "paranoid secure permissions" for you
might be "criminal insecurity" for the next guy.

All of them handle them as files that have persistent permissions, AFAIK.

Useless, if I need it at boot.

"No changes", "10 extra lines for each driver", "my driver was simpler
because of devfs" are all claims made here. Note the last one: If true,
that driver will _force_ devfs, as it won't work otherwise. So "just #ifdef
it to nil" won't work.

Capabilities can not be handled in user space. If they are, they are next
to useless: The kernel won't be able to distinguish a faked capability
handler from the real one, and the security you should get goes out the
window. Same with permissions on devices: They have to be handled in the
kernel, as they are way to important to be handled outside by insecure means.

Great! How is it handled? What percentage of the admin time goes into
managing devices? 1%? 0.1%? Less? More? 10%? 20%?

Which ones? Why? How is that managed now? How will a simple naming scheme

WHAT problems, exactly, does devfs (which is just a naming scheme) solve?

There is yet to be the "first set of dynamic devices" (USB), the discussion
started precisely on how to handle them. If devfs really did solve all, the
discussion would not even have started. That it did shows precisely that
devfs does _not_ solve the issues involved.
