Ben, does it work at all currently read/write requests on sockets ? I
would like to test AIO on networking using my test http server, and I was
thinking about using poll() for async accept and AIO for read/write. The
poll() should be pretty fast because there's only one fd in the set and
the remaining code will use AIO for read/write. Might this work currently ?
