Hi,

Did I miss something, or isn't it at the ftp.*.kernel.org mirrors?
Oh, I also put a diff between my tree and the pre3 up. The diff contains
only compile-fixes and is 430Kb in size (gziped 82Kb). It is available from
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/kernel/patch-2.3.99pre3-av1.gz
It contains a lot of small compilation fixes, so if anyone has problems
compiling 2.3.99pre3, give this patch a try...
It also fixes the folling items from the ToDo list:
- Fix the nameclash between cramfs and PPP about ZLib by renaming the 
  clashing symbols in cramfs
- Removes SGI Visual workstation (doesn't compile, doesn't work and is not
   maintained or even slightly supported by SGI)

Same for my patch :-)
