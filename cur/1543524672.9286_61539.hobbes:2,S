There is never any "indefinate" block on close, because the retransmission
timer for the FIN will kill (and wakeup) the sock after some time.
IMHO the behaviour is correct, otherwise the application could not be
sure that really all data has reached the other end. This way you are
guaranteed to get a error return when data is lost.
