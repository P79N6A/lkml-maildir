<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using a 3Com 3C985b on the 
2.2.14 kernel (I am running the driver as a module).&nbsp; If the card currently 
has a network connection (i.e. I plugged the dumb thing in), it works fine 
whether I give it an IP, or I use DHCP; however, when I do not have a network 
connection and I use DHCP I get a kernel panic.&nbsp; The simplest solution is 
to just plug the dumb thing in and not use DHCP, and this is what I have done; 
however, since the industry we work in doesn't accept any failure (My boss says 
"Fix it"), I need a solution.&nbsp; The system I am running&nbsp;on is a Duel 
Pentium III 500 (not copermine), with 512 Meg of ECC Ram, and a Mylex 
DAC1164.&nbsp; I also have the 3C59x module loaded that is acting as a fail-over 
for the acenic.&nbsp; One of my options is NOT to use the 2.4.x beta series 
since my company does not like to use bleeding edge technology.&nbsp; I have set 
the buffers on the card to 356k in /proc and am at a loss.&nbsp; Any help (even 
pointing me in the right direction would be nice.)</FONT></DIV>
