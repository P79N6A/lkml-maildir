Remote controls don't generate key-up events (think what would
happen if you press a button and then someone walks in between
while you release the key). Instead they generate key-down
and repeated key-still-down events. The repeat rate generated
by remote controls varies roughly between 100...300 msecs and
even depends on battery level for many remotes.
If you use a timer to simulate key-up after you received no
key-still-down for some time, and use input core autorepeat,
then you get this annoying effect that input core generates
key repeats after you released the key on the remote control.
