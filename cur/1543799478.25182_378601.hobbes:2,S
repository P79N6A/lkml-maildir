Here it goes. Rediffed, also plugs a leak my previous patch introduced. I
believe it addresses Linus' comments. It's still not a proper fix (see
below), but I believe it's better than none.

Work around asus_acpi driver oopses on Samsung P30s and the like due to the
ACPI implicit return.
The code used to rely on a certain method to return a NULL buffer, which
is now hardly possible with the implicit return code on by default. This
sort of fixes bugs #5067 and #5092 for now.
Note: this patch makes the driver unusable on said machines (and on said
machines only) iff acpi=strict is specified, but it seems noone really uses
that.
