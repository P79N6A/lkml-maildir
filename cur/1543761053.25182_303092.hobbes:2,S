In that case I think that both problems (race and scalability)
can be solved without increasing sizeof(timer_list).
What if timer_list had ->pending field? Then we can do:
timer_pending:
	return timer->pending;
__mod_timer:
	internal_add_timer(new_base, timer);
	timer->base = new_base;
	timer->pending = 1;
__run_timers:
	list_del(&timer->entry);
	set_running_timer(base, timer);
	/* do not change timer->base */
	timer->pending = 0;
	spin_unlock(base->lock);
	timer->function();
del_timer:
	if (!timer->pending)
		return 0;
	base = timer->base;
	...
del_timer_sync:
	base = timer->base;
	if (!base)
		return 0;
	spin_lock(base->lock);
	if (base != timer->base)
		goto del_again;
	if (base->running_timer == timer)
		goto del_again;
	if (timer->pending)
		list_del(&timer->entry);
	timer->pending = 0;
	timer->base = NULL;
The ->pending flag could live in the least significant bit of
timer->base, this way we:
	1. do not waste the space
	2. can read/write base+pending atomically
These patches are incomplete/suboptimal, just a proof of concept.
Oleg.
