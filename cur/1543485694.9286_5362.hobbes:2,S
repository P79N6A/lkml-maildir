 For some reason aty_fb xconfig entry can neither be selected nor
deselected. I did enable the "framebuffer devices" option and "y" and "n"
choices are displayed in black, but when I click nothing happens.
 I was able to get around this in the past by disabling aty_fb entrees for 
other systems (like Mac) - looks like when there is only one atyfb
everything goes ok. But there should be a better way of doing it.
