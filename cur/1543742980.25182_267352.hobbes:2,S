if you were correct then i should be able to measure 1 cycle differences
in sequences such as the following:
	rdtsc
	mov %eax,%edi
	shr $1,%ecx
	rdtsc
	rdtsc
	mov %eax,%edi
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	rdtsc
...
	rdtsc
	mov %eax,%edi
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	shr $1,%ecx
	rdtsc
yet the attached program demonstrates that such measurements are
inaccurate.  the results should be a sequence of numbers increasing
by 1 each time.
