You don't get to see the bug reports or questions I respond to which
are sent to me privately or on the devfs list (I know you're not
subscribed:-). And you seem to have forgotten that I've responded to
questions or bug reports *from you* that you send privately to me,
sometimes Cc:ed to Linus. I've even responded to questions that you've
placed in the code. So it's simply not true that I only respond if
beat upon in public. Progress *is* being made, irrespective of your
"input".
As for the recent bug reports, yes, I've just seen them. I'll respond
(not because you've been flaming about it on the list) later this week
once I clear through my email backlog which accumulated while I was
off the 'net for a week. Yeah, it does take time to wade through all
the email, especially when I get greeted with a huge pile of flames.
