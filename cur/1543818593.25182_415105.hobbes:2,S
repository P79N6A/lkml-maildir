Sorry my brain has been off thinking about a subtle
bug accidentally introduced in 2.6.17-rc1.
You are absolutely right.  Somehow I missed the
fact that show_map_internal was using m->private.
Because get_gate_vma doesn't actually use it's argument
no bad behavior will result but that could change.
As for the seek case you may be right.
I have a cold that is beating on me, and I need to take a nap.
I remember looking at that closely and not seeing a problem,
but I have made mistakes before, and I'm not certain I recall
the seek case.
