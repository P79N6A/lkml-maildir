Ok: Assume that i've read the mke2fs manpage and added more inodes to
my filesystem.
So: What happens if i need to grow my filesystem by 200% after 1-2
years? Can i add more inodes to Ext3 on-the-fly ?
A filesystem with a fixed number of inodes (= not readjustable while
mounted) is ehr.. somewhat unuseable for a lot of people with
big and *flexible* storage needs (Talking about NetApp/EMC owners)
Why are a lot of Solaris-people using (buying) VxFS? Maybe because UFS
also has such silly limitations? (..and performs awkward with trillions
of files..?..)
Ext3 may be a fine and stable Filesystem and works well for a lot of
people. But there are also a lot of people who need 'something' better
like: VxFS, WAFL and Reiser4.
Btw: Do you know Adics 'StorNext Filesystem' ? 
IMHO Ext3 will never be able to do such things...
But with Reiser4.. .. if someone wrote a plugin .. ;-)

 Adrian
