Try dropping it down to runlevel 1 and make sure that all unecessary 
running processes are terminated. Then try taking it back up to default 
runlevel, you may have changed a few libraries under some programs. 
Otherwise there isn't much linux-kernel can do for you ;) If you mention 
VM problems Andrea might just get you to download 
2.4.18-pre4-aa1-11-343-HF-aa23 ;) or someone will make you run a bazillion
benchmarks with X variations of -rmap, -aa, -preempt, ll, mini-ll, -ata, 
-ac just to see wether your mp3s still skip ;)
Good Luck,
