This patch fixes it, and there was no message during boot about not being 
ready, nor after the machine had fully booted.  Great ;-)
However, I did get an oops when warm booting the kernel, I suspect this may be 
the oops that I get every now and then when warm rebooting, with no real 
pattern, and possibly isn't related to the patch.  As my serial console wasn't 
set up at the time, I took a photo instead, at
