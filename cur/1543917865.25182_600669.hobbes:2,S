Last run was about a year ago.
This box gets regularly updated (rebuild of all installed software),
so I'm reasonably certain that memory is ok - gcc being almost as 
sensitive as memtest.
Will recheck anyway.

Judging from linux and freebsd mailing lists, the TX4 is now quite 
well-known for
intermittent problems, which are hard to reproduce on different hardware.
I have two machines with those controllers, one FreeBSD-6.2 on MSI 
K8Neo2 motherboard (ATI chipset),
  and this one. FreeBSD box does not exhibit this problem under the 
little load it gets, but
6-STABLE and 7-CURRENT branches do have similar symptoms since around 19 
April 2007,
with rare occurences (but not unheard of) before.
Thus I am unable to keep machines up to date, and before having to dump 
$140 worth of hardware,
I'd like to try to help fix this problem or at least be certain that 
those controllers are indeed unusable.

This is a common problem with at least VIA onboard controllers and 
Seagate disks,
and I think with SATA150 controllers and speed negotiation in general.
This step was suggested in some mailing list as a general precaution, but
actually made no difference to error rate.
I did not unjumper drivers back to SATA300 so that I can easily connect 
the drives
to the onboard controller.
