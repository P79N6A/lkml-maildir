Hi,
hmm, there must be a misunderstanding here. I did have a soundcard of
which the DA/AD's added another (ca.) 5 ms of latency to the systematic
latency (1.3 ms roundtrip with 32 frames per period at 48khz
samplerate). I could hear the difference between using a periodsize of
64 frames to a periodsize of 32 frames with that card.. 32 frames/period
gave me a total latency of around 6.3 ms. 64 frames/per period resulted
in a total roundtrip latency of 7.7 ms. I could hear that difference. 32
was very well usable, 64 wasn't. It seems my personal borderline for
perceiving "zero latency" was somewhere between 6.3 and 7.7 ms..
Maybe my original post was badly worded. Hope to have cleared it up
(also i'm not sure on the exact value of the additional latency the
AD/DA's introduced. Might also have been 4 or 6 ms.. Something in that
range though)..
