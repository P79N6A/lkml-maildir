ATA_AR_POOL sounds good. It indicates where it's comming from and
where it is going to remain. BTW.> Have you noticed the tactile steps
forward I did in conversion of ide-cd.c to the new command submission in IDE 37?
Any suggestions? It isn't really that abvious how to get finally rid
of struct packt_command... but I think that I'm not far away now.
The only thing that has to be done is to move the sense data and failed
command used in ide-cd away from the packet command structure.
I will not pass it as pointer around but just copy it directly to struct
ata_devices driver_data field... I think.
