remember that the windows NT permission model is theoreticly superior to the 
Unix permission model.
however there are far more insecure windows boxes out there then Unix boxes 
(even if taken as a percentage of the installed base)
I don't think that anyone is claiming that AA is superior to SELinux
what people are claiming is that the model AA is proposing can improve security 
in some cases.
to use the example from this thread /etc/resolv.conf
if you have a webserver that wants to do a name lookup you can do one of two 
things
1. in AA configure the webserver to have ro access to /etc/resolv.conf
2. in SELinux tag /etc/resolv.conf, figure out every program on the sytem that 
accesses it, and then tag those programs with the right permissions.
SELinux is designed to be able to make the box safe against root, AA is designed 
to let the admin harden exposed apps without having to think about the other 
things on the system.
allow people to use each tool for the appropriate task.
