Thanks!
I just compared Andrea's version with the util-linux version
and folded the three lines or so difference (addition of a -T option).
The rest of Andrea's changes are to print out that he is the maintainer
of lp.c. Somewhat surprising, but if Michael Johnson has no objections
and Andrea says he really wants, I'll take tunelp out of util-linux.
