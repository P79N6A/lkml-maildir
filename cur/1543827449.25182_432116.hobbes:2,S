This was temporary, because the handling of it has been moved to
kernel/power/swap.c and mm/swapfile.c now, but the code has not changed much
(surely it doesn't return -ENODEV if swsusp_resume_device is not set).
Moreover, the new code has been in -rc since 2.6.17-rc1.
The report you are referring to is for the kernel called 2.6.16-1.2255_FC6. 
Is this just 2.6.17-rc* renamed or is it related to -rc in another way?
Greetings,
Rafael
