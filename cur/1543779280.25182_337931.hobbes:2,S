That doesn't make sense because sd is a very different driver from sd.
Besides that aliasing different dev_ts to the same underlying blockdevice
can't work, it's cause all sorts of aliasing problems.

Historical coincidence.

There's no nice way to fix it unfortunately.

It would probably be better to use device-mapper than the loop device.
I think there's already userland partition parsing code for dm, and
having a simple command line tool to do that, and maybe even automatically
run through udev and creating /dev/sr<num>p<partition> devices would
be very nice to have as an almost invisible workaround.
