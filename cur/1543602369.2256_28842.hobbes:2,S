With O_DIRECT (buffer cache bypass open() flag) now in the mainstream
kernel, I wonder if people would be opposed to making a "direct" mount
option, which would open all files on the filesystem with the O_DIRECT
flag, just as there exists a "sync" mount option to perform filesystem
transactions synchronously.
This would allow you to 
    mount -o direct,sync /dev/hdb1 /mnt/video
And would be useful for things like streaming video applications,
allowing the advantages of O_DIRECT without rewriting every application
you want to use.
Cheers,
