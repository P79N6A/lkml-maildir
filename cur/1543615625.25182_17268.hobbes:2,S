    Guys, wait a minute with that.  There is a related issue (->i_rdev
    becoming dev_t) and I'd rather see it handled first.
Those are independent issues.
If init_special_inode() has major,minor arguments instead of
the present rdev, then the line
	inode->i_rdev = to_kdev_t(rdev);
just becomes
	inode->i_rdev = mk_kdev(major,minor);
I consider every occurrence of mk_kdev() and of to_kdev_t()
a flaw in the kernel, so this change does not make things
better or worse inside init_special_inode().
