Yes I had... I expected a solution here ...  but not !
Just changed my mother board for a P5N-E... it works correctly with 4GB but I 
had also to change 2 DDR2 not recognized by this new system ... My opinion 
memory is not the root cause as long memory test did not detect errors on the 
initial system...
Problem is closed for me as I changed my hardware .. but if someone could 
confirm the issue on an other and same system ... it would be interresting as 
this problem apeared for me when I add +2GB on my system, causing some lost 
of data on my server and numerous crashed ... I mean the impact on data could 
be hudge.
