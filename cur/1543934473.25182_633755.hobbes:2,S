The following is a series of patchsets related to Unionfs.  This is the
third set of patchsets resulting from an lkml review of the entire unionfs
code base.  The most significant change here is a locking/race bugfix during
dentry revalidation.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.24-rc6-179-gb8c9a18), MM, as well as the backports to
2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2,
ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  Also tested with
LTP-full.  See 
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported
unionfs code.
