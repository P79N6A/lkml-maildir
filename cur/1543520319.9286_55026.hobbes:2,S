Its modularity is purely formal, because it imports functions, which
are not supposed to be exported in any curcumstances and it touches
the deepest bowels of networking internals.
And it does affect the networking, because does things which it was
difficult to imagine even in nightmare, sort of bearing back open requests.
The cost are additional protections, which eat bits of CPU time for all
and useful only for khttpd.
