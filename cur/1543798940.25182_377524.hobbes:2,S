No complex problem ever requires a big stack.  It may require a large amount
of memory - which can be allocated explicitly outside the stack.

I suggest a little experiment for you.  Make a kernel module which do 
nothing
except try to allocate 16k of _contigous_ kernel memory, and
printk whether it succeeded or failed before exiting.  Have cron run that
every 5 minutes.  After a few weeks of running this low-impact test on
a busy loaded server, look at statistics about how often the 16k allocation
worked - and how often it failed. 
Whatever failure rate you get, expect the same failure rate for server
processes forking to handle new connections while running with 16k stacks.
Failing one out of a hundred times would probably not be tolerated
for a webserver, and I suspect the failure rate for this will be higher - if
the machine has a reasonable memory load and the usual fragmentation.
On the other hand, if you can surprise us about how this works very
well - then you have a strong argument!
