What about the new async crypto stuff? I've been looking, but is it
guarenteed that async_memcpy() runs in process context with interrupts
enabled always? If not, there's a km type bug there.
In general, I think the highmem stuff could do with more safety checks:
- People ALWAYS get the atomic unmaps wrong, passing in the page instead
  of the address. I've seen tons of these. And since kunmap_atomic()
  takes a void pointer, nobody notices until it goes boom.
- People easily get the km type wrong - they use KM_USERx in interrupt
  context, or one of the irq variants without disabling interrupts.
If we could just catch these two types of bugs, we've got a lot of these
problems covered.
