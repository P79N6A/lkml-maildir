I agree Nigel, but as you pointed out you will have to deal with
scheduling behaviour, interrupt latency and priority inversion to
achieve that.
I was just trying to point out that just having kernel preemptable threads
will enable, for example, kswapd to adjust itself more efficiently with the
current load of the system and what it needs to achieve (running from
low priority to non preemptable thread). Providing a better (smoother)
swap behaviour.
Saying that, I definitely agree that I want/need to one day listen to
my MP3s while building  my kernel.
Ludo.
