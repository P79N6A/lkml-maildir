Subject: no input with kernel 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 and X

With kernel 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 I lose input completely the moment I start
X. Keyboard is completely non-functional (include sysrq and num/ctrl
lock) and the touchpad also doesn't seem to produce anything.
The computer is otherwise functional and I can ssh in from another
machine and chvt to the console where I get the keyboard back. chvt
back to X kills input again.
Input is completely function in the console and with kernel 2.6.8-rc2
also with X, so I don't think its an X configuration problem.
