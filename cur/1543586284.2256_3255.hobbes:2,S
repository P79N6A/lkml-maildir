Grumble. Grumble. Grumble.
We've been through this before.  The 6.1.8 version of the
driver has a fixed Makefile, doesn't even attempt to assemble
the firmware unless you config your kernel to turn it on, and has
been out for over a month now.
I guess it will have to wait until 2.4.4.  I'll post updated
patches for 2.4.3 later today, but the ones for 2.4.3-pre6 should
apply fine.
