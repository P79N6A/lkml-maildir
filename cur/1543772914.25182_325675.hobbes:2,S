Hi,
I'm a kernel newbie and are reading the source code about process
management of kernel-2.11.10
I found it has not only the sys_clone() but also three explict syscalls
in the arch/<ARCH>/kernel/process.c
sys_fork(), sys_vfork(), sys_clone()
is this means the library calls no more wrap the sys_clone() for the
three library call(fork,vfork,clone), but
call the corresponding syscall? or it never did that?
I've also downloaded the source code of glibc-2.3.5, but I'm not
sure where I should I start to figure out this.
Thank you for your reply.
Roy
