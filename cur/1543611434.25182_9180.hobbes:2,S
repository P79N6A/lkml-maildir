No problem ;-).
There is the hardware: in esp. the serial controller itself - this
belongs
to misc, becouse a mouse for example doesn't have to interpret any tty
stuff
This animal belongs to the same cage as the PS/2 variant of it.
And then there is one abstraction level above it: the tty interface -
this belongs to a line discipline.
We have this split anyway already there /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/cua0 somehow
emulated on one level.
Understood?
