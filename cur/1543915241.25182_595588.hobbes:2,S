[ofa-general] [PATCH 2 of 2] IB/mlx4: Handle new FW requirement for send request prefetching, for WQE sg lists
(Posted by me to list on Sept 4)
{patch header: 
This is an addendum to Roland's commit 0e6e74162164d908edf7889ac66dca09e7505745
(June 18). This addendum adds prefetch headroom marking processing for s/g segments.
We write s/g segments in reverse order into the WQE, in order to guarantee
that the first dword of all cachelines containing s/g segments is written last
(overwriting the headroom invalidation pattern). The entire cacheline will thus
contain valid data when the invalidation pattern is overwritten.
}
This patch series (1 of 2 is for libmlx4, the same issue).
============================================================
Also, I'm now posting (in a separate post) the following patch to mlx4, which is important:
  display the following device information via sysfs:
  board_id, fw_ver, hw_rev, hca_type.
  The info is displayed under directory /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_x, where x is
  the pci bus sequence number (starting from zero).
  This patch makes information available to ibstat and ibv_devinfo under the
  same directory as is used for tavor/arbel/sinai -- thus requiring no userspace
  modifications.
