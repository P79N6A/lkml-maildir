Grrr, please hold this.  The tree looks broken.
At least, the last patch
       [ALSA] hda-codec - Revert volume knob controls in STAC codecs
wasn't applied properly, and resulted in an empty change.
This is likely because the patch used was for mm tree and not cleanly
applied to 2.6.24-rc3.  It'll require a manual adjustment.
In addition, the following patches are real fixes that miss in this
push:
	5543	emu10k1 - Check value ranges in ctl callbacks
	5532	fix private data pointer calculation in CS4270 driver
	5530	emu10k1: Add mixer controls parameter checking.
	5495	portman2x4 - Fix probe error
	5485	ca0106 - Fix write proc assignment
	5476	s3c2443-ac97: compilation fix
thanks,
Takashi
