Only if you need 10 ms latencies 100.000...0% of the time.  Which isn't
always the case.
The rest of the time, you can do very well by providing a way to supply
"tentative" data in advance of need, but cancel it and replace it with
better data when something happens... something explodes in a game, or
a new person speaks up in an audio conferencing application, or a new MIDI
event arrives.
Real-time DSP is a different matter, but the point I'm trying to make
is that there is a non-zero set of applications for which additional
API festures allow low average latency and guaranteed lack of total
dropouts.
Simply writing to /dev/dsp doesn't give you that, but e.g. DMA out of
user-space buffers does.
