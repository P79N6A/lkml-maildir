I mean %dx -- you'd built a 32-bit counter into %dx:%cx.

It's part of the counter.  This seems to be *your* code, since there
is nothing even closely similar in any previous kernel, so I don't
know what you're trying to do here...

Doesn't change the fact that the board is still broken, and they
didn't provide the BIOS routine to compensate.  At that point, the
fact that the old code worked by accident is unfortunately irrelevant;
especially since you obviously have a workaround that you can use.

No, but the sequence in verbatim either before or after the call
delay.
