You should run your patch through scripts/checkpatch.pl before 
pushing... there are several notables in there like tons of trailing 
whitespace, use of spaces rather than tabs, lack of whitespace inside 
expressions, etc.
The "line over 80 chars" warning can get a bit obnoxious, if you are 
barely over the limit, but the other warnings are pretty reasonable.
