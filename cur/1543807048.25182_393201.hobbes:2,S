First off, this should not be a pointer, but rather:
	struct device dev;
That properly embedds the struct device into your object.

What type of bus does this device live on?  You should not be calling
device_register() on your own directly.  Either use a bus, and be a
device of it, or use the platform_device() interface.

Yup.

What is the backtrace?

Again, register with a bus or use the platform_device() interface, and
this should work properly.

Yes, you kind of need all of that :)
Make the above changes and let us know if that helps things.
