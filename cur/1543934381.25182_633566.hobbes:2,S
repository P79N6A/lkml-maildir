You say that, but you then ignore that something *did* change.
Maybe it's not that one suspicious test. Maybe it's somethign else. But 
that commit was confirmed to break something, almost two months ago. You 
guys seem to be in denial, and saying "it didn't change anything".
And no, waiting for more reporters when one reporter has already narrowed 
it down to the exact (smallish) commit, is simply not good. Either you can 
fix it by looking at the source, or it gets reverted.
I was hoping somebody in SCSI-land would actually look at the commit and 
try to find out what's wrong, instead of all of you apparently trying to 
say "nothing is wrong".
I hate the excuses of "but, but, but.. it *should* work". It doesn't. Face 
that, *then* you can argue about why.
