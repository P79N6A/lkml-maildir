Happened to be looking more closely than usual at my dmesg looking for something
else, and spotted this:
[    6.079043] power_supply BAT0: 11 dynamic props
[    6.079045] power_supply BAT0: prop STATUS=Full
[    6.079047] power_supply BAT0: prop PRESENT=1

[    6.079301] ACPI: SSDT 7FE82138, 0244 (r1  PmRef  Cpu0Ist     3000 INTL 20050624)

What's with that TIME_TO_FULL_AVG value?  Is the battery on crack, or my BIOS,
or the driver?  I expected time units, not a Dell part number ;) (Yes, I know
CHARGE_FULL is low, the battery is pretty beat, and  Latitudes seem to always
report CHARGE_NOW as "design full" when running off the AC power brick)
(For the record, dmidecode says:

So it even managed to lose the trailing 'A'.. ;)
