So, with a 100 ms sleep, I should see 100 +/- 1 ms, possibly 2 ms
difference in sleep between processes. Then they might not get the
CPU for a whole quantum? Wouldn't each task get the CPU for a whole
tick?
Are you saying that each might get the CPU from between 0 and 1
tick, i.e., asynchronous with the tick? If so, depending upon the
phase between the timer-tick and when a task gets awakened, a task
may never get any CPU time at all. If so, this is a bug.
