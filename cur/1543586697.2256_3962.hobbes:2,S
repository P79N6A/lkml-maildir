Hi,
i've tried it with minicom and functioned : ctrl+a+F and key for function
as in normal sysrq.
This approach will probably not help you a lot thought, since you wouldn't
have access to your serial console too.
If you don't get your problems solved till now, i could make a simple
single-purpos module which will export a syscall to priviledged process
to call sysrq functions.
Gonna to have a look...
