Sorry, yeah I had it the wrong way around. Your patch would not
increase the probability of this problem.
We could have some logic in there to scan highmem when buffer
heads are over limit. But that really kind of sucks in that it introduces
some arbitrary point where reclaim behaviour completely changes...
Adding a shrinker for buffer heads is the "logical" approach that we
take for other non-page caches. That also kind of sucks because we
normally don't want to do this out of band buffer reclaiming and just
have it work from page reclaim (it will introduce extra locking and list
scanning).
Maybe when the machine is near OOM, we can just change the scanning
to do all zones -- a change in scanning behaviour at that point is better
than oom kill.
