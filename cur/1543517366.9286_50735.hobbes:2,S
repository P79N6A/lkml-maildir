   I can't speak for 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3, but I've got a pair of production
   systems (the Mastodon build machine and a workstation) that are running
   2.0.28+logo perfectly happily on K7/500's.  One of them is on the ASUS
   K7 motherboard, the other one is on the FIC motherboard, and the only
   problem with both of these is that they will not boot with a genuine
   IBM keyboard attached to them. (If you disconnect the IBM keyboard,
   boot the machine, then plug it in so the machine won't freak out when
   it can't find a keyboard, everything is happy.  Non-IBM keyboards don't
   provoke this problem, which is *extremely* annoying and will keep my
   personal workstations as K5s and K6s for the immediate future.)
