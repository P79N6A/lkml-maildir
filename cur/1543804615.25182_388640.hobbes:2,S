Linus is presently in the PDX departure lounge, on his way to finding out
how hard Kiwis bite.
And I doubt if he'll be merging this - too big, too late.  I guess that's
why he ducked your January 16 pull request too.
I think it would be best at this stage if you were, over the next week, to
cherrypick just the bugfixes and send those along for 2.6.16.
