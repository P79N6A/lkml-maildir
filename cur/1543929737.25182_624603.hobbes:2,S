I think the shared superblock approach is the right one, but I'm a
little concerned that there would now be different behavior for fscache
and non-cached setups. Not sure of any better idea though.

Given that, how many connection parameters are there that are likely to
actually differ on the same client, talking to the same server? Really?

You could store the table in a NIS map, for example, and a udev rule or
similar could trigger to load it later.
