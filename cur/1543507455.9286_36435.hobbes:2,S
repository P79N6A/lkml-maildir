Hello everyone,
	I am in the process of starting up a "Computer Help Network"
on irc. it will be a whole new irc network the purpose of this network
is to simply but surely and honestly bring all help channels of all
smaller or bigger networks to this network to be united in order to
make information and help, etc easier to get and to create a new
irc network.
         All computer subject and or fields will be allowed on this
network such as unix, linux, programming, www pages, etc etc.
	I am emailing this mailling list to get the linux' users
reponse to this idea. I will state that I am looking for irc servers
to be linked and am probably going to be needed quite a few irc
operators. Please feel free to reply to this email with any suggestions, 
comments, ideas or offers. anything is welcome!
	Our network is up but not open to the public until we get
more stable servers running our main hubs and ircd services. If you
could please just simply let me know what you think of this idea
and if you would be willing to come on to such a network to get help,
information, or to help out, etc.
Thank you for your time!
						Sincerely,
