 You need timer_ack set to one when either:
1. you use the I/O APIC NMI watchdog and you have a discrete APIC chip
(i.e. the 82489DX),
or:
2. the timer interrupt (IRQ 0) goes through one of the APICs (whatever
way; we check three variations) and the TSC is non-functional (absent or 
disabled).
Since you have an integrated APIC and you use the TSC, you may have 
timer_ack set to zero.  That saves a few (possibly slow) I/O accesses and 
works around problems that may arise due 8259A clone (in)compatibility or 
bugs in SMM firmware.
