It might make a difference if STATS is on, because freehit/freemiss might 
share a cache line with nodelists. Apart that, a kmem_cache struct is 
read_mostly : All changes are done outside of it, via array_cache or nodelists[].
Anyway slab STATS is already a SMP/NUMA nightmare because of cache line ping 
pongs. We might place STATS counter in a/some dedicated cache line(s)...
