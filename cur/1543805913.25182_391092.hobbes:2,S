Hi,
i'm also interested in these. Especially I/O priorities per process/task
similar to scheduling priorities. It would be just awesome to be able to
give i.e. a hd recording program (or any other data aquisition or
playback program) a high I/O priority.
Image no buffer overruns ever in a hd recorder. Or no more video
dropouts when watching a movie and at the same time copying a file from
the same partition you play the video from.
Is there any work done in this area. I faintly remember to have read
about something like this over a year ago, but have forgotten all the
specifics.
Thanks for all infos and regards,
Florian Schmidt
