Basically yes, but it's part of a small cleanup I forgot to comment. (See

I agree that this could use better comments, although some changes are 
only temporary, so some things I'll probably only comment better in the 
changelog.

This is the part which normalizes time_adj, so it's always positive and 
saves two checks in update_wall_time_one_tick().
(BTW in the long term I want to merge these two into a single 64 bit 
variable, but it requires a few more changes.)

It's connected to the removed "- 10" above and below, it moves the crude 
usec to nsec conversion (it divides by 1024 instead of 1000) to a single 
spot, so it's easier to remove in a later patch.
I initially wanted to mention this in the changelog, but forgot about it, 
I'll update it.

See above.

Thanks. :)
