Bah, it's a slippery slope. Too little guidelines and we end up people
submitting code that is "obviously" violating Linux coding standards
on the basis of that it's not forbidden by Documentation/CodingStyle.
And with too much detail, we end up with something that nobody wants
to read let alone follow. So what CodingStyle should say, really, is
that maintainers have different preference and you're usually better
off following them than fighting against them ;-).
