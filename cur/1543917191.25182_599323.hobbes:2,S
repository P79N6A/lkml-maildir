maybe just depends on the amount of used anon_vma and page_mapping_info etc...
I don't think a system which uses SLOB consumes such structs so much
as that memory-for-alignment is considered as "waste" of memory.
Anyway, I decided to go ahead with current container-info-per-page
implementation. If the size of page struct is problem at mainline inclusion
discussion, I'll be back.
Thanks,
