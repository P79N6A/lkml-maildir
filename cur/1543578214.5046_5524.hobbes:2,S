No change with that, as you already know.  But I just noticed that the
ekernel was compiled for i386.  I've recompiled 2.2.18 for i686, and
this comes out of the boot messages:
  checking TSC synchronization across CPUs: 
  BIOS BUG: CPU#0 improperly initialized, has 2045320 usecs TSC skew!  FIXED.
  BIOS BUG: CPU#1 improperly initialized, has -2045320 usecs TSC skew!  FIXED.
  PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xf0730
This is the ASUS BX dual board with onboard scsi.
But the FIXED above doesn't seem to be true. I still get results like
those below from gettimeofday calls every five seconds. Clearly two
mixed sequences ..
