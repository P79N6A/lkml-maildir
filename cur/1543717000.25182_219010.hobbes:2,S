Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Xplore CVS! (xcvs) - a web-based CVS tracking tool
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I am pleased to announce that xcvs has reached its late beta
release v0.2.1.
http://xcvs.sourceforge.net
Xcvs is a web-based CVS tracking tool. Each commit (check-in) to a CVS
repository is viewed as one logical, coherent change.  The web interface
allows one to query the changes by branch, author, date/time, and etc.,
and view each change as a patch file.
Please redirect future discussions about xcvs to the xcvs mailing list, 
xcvs public forum or directly to me.
Thanks for your attention.
