Do you have a paper reference? I know that there are issues when using
sequence numbers as IVs for CBC, but that is an isolated problem for
CBC-like modes.

Perhaps we should make Counter mode available for loop_gen.c. It does
not have the artifacts that CBC has when seqence numbers are used as
IVs. On the contrary: sequential IVs are an integral part of CTR mode
encryption. This mode is not only just as secure as CBC, but has also
the added bonus of only requiring encryption, something the AES would
benfit from immensely, since decryption is so much slower for Rijndael
than encryption and reads (decryption) are typically used more often in
a filesystem than writes (encryption).

Hm, I don't get you here. If I was to use absolute block numbers as IVs
on a 1k block size ext2 filesystem, I could theoretically end up with
the following mapping of loop device blocks vs. ext2 blocks
Q> loop:	0	1	2	3	4	5
Q> ext2:	12	13	14	22	23	24
If I used IVseed = 12 here, the first three blocks would decrypt
correctly, yet the forth would decrypt to white noise.

As CTR mode _requires_ unique IVs (CBC does not), the upper half of the
IV could be initialized from the key, whose length would thus grow by
50%. The lower half would contain the relative block number in units of
512 bytes.
