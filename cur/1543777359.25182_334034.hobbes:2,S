What is little? Given that there's 'roughly' 119 languages (find 
/usr/share/locale -type d -maxdepth 1 | wc -l), you'd surely reconsider if 
adding 119 23KB files, if it was considered "small".
As I perceive it, the policy is: no PO files in mainline at all. I'm fine with 
that.
Keeping the translations in sync with the mainline Kconfig help texts/etc. is 
also not an easy task unless you got a lot of time to spare.
