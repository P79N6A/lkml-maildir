/tmp is not a problem, because this can be fixed by using tmpfs
(I use 2GB of it with 1GB of RAM).
Bad are the small writes generated by the proposed behavior. 
The disk is idle, so this is not about performance, but power
consumption. Spinning up a disk costs around 1-2 seconds, so you
should come in with at least the amount of data you write in 1-2
seconds for a spun down disk.
