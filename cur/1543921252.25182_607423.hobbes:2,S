Subject: [PATCH v3] kconfig: update kconfig-language text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add kconfig-language docs for mainmenu, def_bool, and def_tristate.
Remove "requires" as a synonym of "depends on" since it was removed
from  the parser in commit 247537b9a270b52cc0375adcb0fb2605a160cba5.
