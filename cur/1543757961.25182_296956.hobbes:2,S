Yes the connector's callback is a good solution. I will add a fork
enable/disable callback in drivers/connector/connector.c that will
switch a global variable when called from user space. It will be
something like:
void cn_fork_callback(void)
{
	if (cn_already_initialized) 
		cn_fork_enable = cn_fork_enable ? 0 : 1 ;
} 
With cn_fork_enable set to 0 by default. In the do_fork() I will replace
the statement "if (cn_already_initialized)" by "if (cn_fork_enable)"

I will protect the incrementation by a spin_lock(&fork_cn_lock).
