Kernel performance data for 2.6.14-rc4 is updated at:
http://kernel-perf.sourceforge.net
991 patches went in for rc4 since rc3, all perf. results are
pretty much flat compares to 2.6.14-rc3.  This is probably as
expected since kernel is in the quiet mode.
Result with fileio went up on IPF box, and it is because of a
intermittent bug in the mpt fusion driver. A fix is proposed [*].
We are working on having a sensible configuration for dbench,
all numbers presented on the web site are taken with default
parameters, and it needs to be taken with a grain of salt at
the moment.
