... except ones that will not.  Wonderful.  I bow to that logics - there
is nothing it wouldn't cover.

BS.  There is nothing to stop you from having a block device that talks
to userland process instead of any form of hardware.  As the matter of
fact, we already have such a beast - nbd.  There is also RAID - where
there fsck is 1:1 here?  There's also such thing as RAID5 over partitions
that sit on several disks - where do you see 1:1 or 1:n or n:1?
There is such thing as e.g. encrypted loop over NFS.  There are all
sorts of interesting things, with all sorts of interesting relationship
to some pieces of hardware.
