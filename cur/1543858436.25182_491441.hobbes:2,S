We also have the interesting case where your card is behind an
isolation-capable IOMMU, so if you let userspace program it, you need
a userspace-accessible DMA-API for IOMMU mappings (or to pre-map
everything in the IOMMU, which loses on some of the benefits of
isolation-capable IOMMUs (i.e., only map what you need to use right
now)).
