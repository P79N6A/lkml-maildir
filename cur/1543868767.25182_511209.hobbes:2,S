-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
reference to .init.text: from .text between 'cx88_card_setup'
(at offset 0x68c) and 'cx88_risc_field'
Caused by leadtek_eeprom() being declared __devinit and called from
a non-devinit context.
