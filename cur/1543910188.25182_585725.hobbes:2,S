I can't seem to find anything in SuS v3 that says that. If you know
where I'd appreciate a pointer.
In fact, the spec seems pretty clear on what errors are OK.
"
    The shmctl() function shall fail if:
    [EACCES]
        The argument cmd is equal to IPC_STAT and the calling process
does not have read permission; see XSI Interprocess Communication.
    [EINVAL]
        The value of shmid is not a valid shared memory identifier, or
the value of cmd is not a valid command.
    [EPERM]
        The argument cmd is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET and the
effective user ID of the calling process is not equal to that of a
process with appropriate privileges and it is not equal to the value
of shm_perm.cuid or shm_perm.uid in the data structure associated with
shmid.
    The shmctl() function may fail if:
    [EOVERFLOW]
        The cmd argument is IPC_STAT and the gid or uid value is too
large to be stored in the structure pointed to by the buf argument.
"
But I guess removing EIDRM is out of the question since that would
break userspace applications currently depending on it.
So I guess that the only way to write applications that are portable
between Linux and other *NIX clones is to test for the error code
being  (EINVAL || EIDRM)...
Or am I missing something?
