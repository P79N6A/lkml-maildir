If it is a transport, then it should be in the kernel. Otherwise, it 
becomes painful
for applications with multiple input sources.  Think of 
epoll/poll/select and threads,
doing the demultiplexing in user space would be a pain for applications 
and libraries.
The other way to go is to use something like dbus/hal and use a higher level
application oriented interface. The problem with that approach, is it 
assumes
every management app wants to drag in gnome..
