This is a known bug that definitely needs fixing:
(to ATA developers)
Any time an ATA command is issued outside of the SCSI layer, we need to 
employ a timer to time out commands.
Since most commands are done within the SCSI layer, which provides a lot 
of error handling apparatus, most commands properly time out.  The ones 
during probe - IDENTIFY DEVICE, set xfer mode, etc. - do not have such a 
timer.
