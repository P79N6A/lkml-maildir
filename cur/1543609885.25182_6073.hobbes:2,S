Checked the BIOS versions and memtested the 'bad' machine, versions match,
no bad memory found.
I tried upgrading on multiple machines, some others failed, some didn't.  So
far, two of our 2450's take 2.4.14 without issue and three don't.
Working:
Dual PIII/667, 1gig, 3x18gb scsi, adaptec 7xxx
Dual PIII/1000, 1gig, 4x18gb scsi, ami megaraid
Not working:
Single PIII/667, 256mb, 2x18gb scsi, adaptec 7xxx
2 x (Dual PIII/667, 1gig, 3x18gb scsi, adaptec 7xxx)
All 5 machines have the same BIOS and 'backplane' rev.
In the 'not working' machines, all three do exactly the same thing: LILO ->
"Loading Linux.." (or something similar, text that flashes very quickly) ->
reboot.  All of these boxes have and are running 2.2.19 without so much as a
single crash (or any other issue, for that matter) since upgrading from
2.2.16.  I can swallow one machine having a fluky RAM issue, but not three.
I'm strongly considering dropping back to 2.2.20...
Thanks,
  John
