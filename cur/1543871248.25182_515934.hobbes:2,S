Been there, done that. Wli wrote the infrastructure for plugsched; I took his 
code and got it booting and ported 3 or so different scheduler designs. It 
allowed you to build as few or as many different schedulers into the kernel 
and either boot the only one you built into your kernel, or choose a 
scheduler at boot time. That code got permavetoed by both Ingo and Linus. 
After that I gave up on that code and handed it over to Peter Williams who 
still maintains it. So please note that I pushed the plugsched barrow 
previously and still don't think it's a bad idea, but the maintainers think 
it's the wrong approach.
RSDL is my attempt to create a cpu scheduler to try to do everything well 
instead of some things perfectly, to be best fit when trying to shoehorn it 
into any environment.
