Subject: 2.3.46 UP OOPS, too unstable to use.

I decided to give 2.3.46 and devfs a try.
It seems unstable though, and goes into an OOPS-loop after a while.
2.3.39 is solid on the same machine - 34 days uptime with lots of
compiles
and network traffic.
I can't decode the OOPS as it loops and scrolls by too fast to write
down the numbers.
It seems to happen if I press a key during a busy kernel compile,
such as trying to switch to another virtual console.
The machine has 128M, pentium II UP, a single IDE drive using PIIX dma,
and a 3x905 ethernet card. 
I attempted to use devfs with no backward compatibility, i.e. with
inittab and fstab changed to use vc/1 instead of tty1 and
/dev/discs/disc0/part3 instead of /dev/hda3 and so on.
The kernel is compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3, and no outside patches
except the compile-fix to ll_rw_blk.c
