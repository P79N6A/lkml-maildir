Subject: [PATCH 000 of 8] md/bitmap: Introduction - rework management of bitmap files.

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I thought it was time to review the md/bitmap code - partly because I
wasn't comfortable with how it was handling writing to files.  The more
I learnt about the VM/VFS, the more I realised it was wrong....
I found plenty to do...
The last patch in this series of 8 is the big one.  It substantially
changes the way bitmap files are handled.  The key change is that it
now works more like swapfile: bmap() is used to find where the blocks
are and write goes direct to storage bypassing the filesystem.
These are *not* for 2.6.17, but should be ok for when 2.6.18 opens.
I've done some testing and it seems to work OK, but it is a big change
and more testing wouldn't be a bad thing :-)
