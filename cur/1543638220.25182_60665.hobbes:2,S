Marcelo,
I've narrowed down the APM problem encountered in -rc5. In fact, it also
affects -rc4, but not -rc3. I'm a bit stumped since the changes are not
too heavy...
The crash happens at the same place with -rc4 and -rc5 : 0xc0120d0c
c0120cec:       fb                      sti
c0120ced:       bb 40 a2 39 c0          mov    $0xc039a240,%ebx

                      ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
The processor branches here (2 bytes after  local_irq_disable()) !!
c0120d10:       85 fe                   test   %edi,%esi
c0120d12:       74 0c                   je     c0120d20 <do_softirq+0x90>
c0120d14:       89 f0                   mov    %esi,%eax
c0120d16:       f7 d0                   not    %eax
c0120d18:       21 c7                   and    %eax,%edi
c0120d1a:       eb c6                   jmp    c0120ce2 <do_softirq+0x52>
This code is from do_softirq() in kernel/softirq.c, lines 84-95 :
                local_irq_enable();
                h = softirq_vec;
                do {
                        if (pending & 1)
                                h->action(h);
                        h++;
                        pending >>= 1;
                } while (pending);
                local_irq_disable();
The hand-written traces show that this function was correctly called by
ksoftirqd(), which in turn was called by kernel_thread().
Part of the hand-written oops shows :
EFLAGS=00010057
eax=00000900 ebx=c039a260 ecx=00000000 edx=c0390000
esi=00000000 edi=fffffff7 ebp=00000000 esp=c15b1fc8
Since softirq_vec is c039a240 in my System.map, I can deduce that h->action(h)
has been called 4 times because it's 8 bytes long. <pending> is represented
by %esi here, which is null. So this implies that it's not the call to h->action(h)
which branched to this place. But int this case, I don't see how the CPU
can branch here (a ret prehaps ?). I don't see in what this can be related to
the "apm=power-off" case either.
Alan, I believe you have the same mobo, but with two MPs on it. Although I've
never had any SMP problem with XPs, did you notice anything strange with APM
on 2.4.19-rc[45] ? I will check 2.4.19-rc3-ac5 to see if it hangs too...
Cheers,
Willy
