hi there -
i'm having one last holdout problem migrating to kernel 2.2.  i've been
having this same problem since i first tried 2.2.3 (i think it was) and
just yesterday i tried a few upgrades to see if it would solve itself...
still didn't.
the problem occurs when i run an xterm after booting up under 2.2.  the
first line in the xterm says something along the lines of "/dev/ttypX:
operation not permitted", and the device is not chowned, so write/talk/etc
to me won't work.  w, who or last show up the tty as follows:
damon    ttyp1ric|Gen :0.0             Tue Aug 24 22:19 - 22:20  (00:00)
(i remember seeing `more full' output once from something else, but i
can't remember what - in any case, it showed up the full word `Generic'.)
right now i'm running kernel 2.2.11 with glibc 2.1 (both compiled locally;
my system is a homebrew based originally on an old slackware version, most
of whose original files are long gone :)  the latest kernel was compiled
with gcc-2.95; the previous 2.2 kernels and glibc were compiled with the
egcs 1.1.2 release, if that means anything.  i just installed xfree86
3.3.4 glibc2 binaries (about the only thing i don't dare try to compile
myself; i'm not sure the p133 is up to it :) and previous to that i had
3.3.3.1.
any thoughts?  has anyone seen this effect before?  the only thing i
*haven't* tried upgrading is glibc2 (i know there's a 2.1.1 release out
there somewhere)... could that be it?  if that seems likely, can anyone
point me at the current canonical source for the libraries?  would it be
the stuff on gnu.org?  (i remember it used to be somewhere else... so i'm
a little confused as to where to look for the correct libs)
on a completely unrelated and off-topic note, does anyone have any
comments on running k2.2 on a dual-processor celeron 300A box?  anyone
overclocking one of these successfully?  i'm thinking about this as a
cheap alternative to a `better' processor.
