Subject: Problem swapping out ipc shm pages

Hi,
 I need to swap out specific pages of an ipc shared memory segment. I 
used to modify the routine shm_swap() in file ipc/shm.c for this. The 
modifications involved changing the segment and page selection code, so 
the new routine would operate on intended pages.
 In recent kernel versions shm_swap has changed considerably. A lot of 
the iteration code (and also the flush_cache_page() and flush_tlb_page()) 
has disappeared. I still tried to get the same effects by modifying 
shm_swap, but failed. 
 Is am providing the code I have tentatively written (and does not work). 
What should be done to make it work?
 Any help is appreciated.

/* this routine swaps out relevant parts of a shared memory. This was

   done the right way! 
   Depending on the value of dipc_page_size, we may want to swap out more 
than one page.
id: determines the shared memory segment
offset: is an address in the page we want to swap out. We may want to swap 
out the whole segment, in which case we ignore this value 
mode: tell the routine if we want to swap out the whole segment
