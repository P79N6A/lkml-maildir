Also OOSTORE is there because other vendors already make weak store
order capable x86 processors. One example of this is the Winchip - where
turning off strict store ordering is worth 30% performance.
In addition you have to treat store ordering/locking carefully due to
the pentium pro store fencing errata. (Thats why our < PII kernel
generates lock movb to unlock when in theory the lock isnt needed).
