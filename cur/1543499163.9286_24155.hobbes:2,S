Hi all,
After I patched the 2.0.37 w/ the large filehandle patch,
I set max number of open file per process to 2048 and set the
max number of process to 2048 also. Then put
 "echo 8192 > /proc/sys/kernel/file-max" and
 "echo 32768> /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max" 
in the rc.local . I started seeing
do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Bad file descriptor
do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Bad file descriptor
do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Bad file descriptor
in the apache error log. I recompiled apache,ypserv,ypbind and I still
get this error in the apache error_log.
I don't have this error on 2.0.36 before. What could cause that?
Regards,
Tom
P.S. System is on AlphaLX164 w/ Redhat 5.2
