Human error.  Create a new kernel with something built in which used to
be a module and forget to make modules_install, so the code is in the
kernel and in /lib/modules.  Then do an explicit insmod, if probing
does not fail the module load then oops is all she wrote.  One of the
reasons I changed modules_install to erase the old directory first was
to minimize this problem, but humans can still stuff it up.  AFAICT it
cannot be fixed in 2.4 because there is no identifier for which
"modules" are included in the kernel.
