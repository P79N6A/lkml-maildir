Subject: [2.3.99pre] ne.o: unresolved symbol(s) (fwd)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

just as in 2.3.51:
 modprobe ne
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_open
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ethdev_init
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_interrupt
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol NS8390_init
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_close
the 8390.o gets compiled but not installed, 
ei_* doesn't show up in makelog at all
all was well in 2.3.49, and same problem with ne2k-pci, 
seems to me the 8390 related drivers suffer?
ne works fine when compiled into kernel
smp kernel,
glibc2.1.3
make  3.78.1
2.95.2
