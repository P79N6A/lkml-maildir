Well that's weird.
For starters, this initialisation will confound lockdep: it should use
DEFINE_SPINLOCK.
And the rationale seems dubious.  All you're saving here is a couple of
accesses to task_struct at spin_unlock()-time.  If the current task has a
preemption pending then yes, we'll schedule away but that's a very rare
thing and that's just what we're supposed to do.
So please tell us more about this.  Perhaps there are performance problems
with the current core preemption machinery.

And of course if this code is converted to conventional locking, the above
becomes spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqrestore() in many places.

There's no value in inlining anything, hardly ;)

postcore_initcall() is unusual, hence a comment describing why it was
employed would be a good thing to have.
