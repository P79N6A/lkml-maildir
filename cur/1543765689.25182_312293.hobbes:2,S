If you secure your system correctly (i.e make /dev/*mem imutable, disalow
module loading, restrict io... (and I admit it is quite complicated to find
all holes and secure it correctly without additional ptches like SELinux))
then even root cant gt arround immutable or append only (without rebooting).
