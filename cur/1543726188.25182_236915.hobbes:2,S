Subject: dma problems with Serverworks CSB5 chipset

Hello,
I have 200 servers in a cluster running vanilla kernel 2.4.26(not 
tainted).  Under heavy I/O activity I have various servers completely 
lose access to their IDE bus.  Logs show the same error every time:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
The kernel resets the IDE bus at this point.  Sometimes things start 
working again but mostly all ide access is lost and I have to reboot the 
server.  The chipset is:
  00:0f.1 IDE interface: ServerWorks CSB5 IDE Controller (rev 93)
I have searched archives for problems with this chipset and I have seen 
other users with this same issue, but no resolution to the problem.  Is 
there a known problem with this chipset version or could there be some 
issues still with the serverworks driver?  Any help would be much 
appreciated.  Thanks.
