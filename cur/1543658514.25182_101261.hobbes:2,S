hi,
  first, I have to say sorry for my 10th posting the same question , I hope 
someone can answer it indeed, it seem too difficult for me.
  I am learning code pci_check_direct(), at arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c
the PCI spec v2.0 say: ( page32)
"Anytime a host bridge sees a full DWORD I/O write from the host to
CONFIG_ADDRESS, the bridge must latch the data into its CONFIG_ADDRESS
register. On full DWORD I/O reads to CONFIG_ADDRESS,the bridge must return
the
data in CONFIG_ADDRESS. Any other types of accesses to this
address(non-DWORD)
have no effect on CONFIG_ADDRESS and are excuted as normal I/O transaction
on PCI bus......"
CONFIG_ADDRESS = 0xCF8
CONFIG_DATA = 0xCFC
so I think "outb (0x01, 0xCFB);" just is a normal write operation to a 
device at port address 0xCFB not a configuration type operation(maybe 
wrong,fix me), then my questions are:
1. which device is at port address 0xCFB? (please note, NOT 0xCF8)
2. what is meaning of the writing operation "outb (0x01, 0xCFB);" for THIS
device?, it'seem that PCI spec v2.0 not say anything about it?
3. why need "outb (0x01, 0xCFB);" before configuration operation "outl
(0x80000000, 0xCF8);" if check configuration type 1? and why need "outb
(0x00, 0xCFB);" before "outb (0x00, 0xCF8);" if check configuration type 2?
please help me, thanks a lot.
