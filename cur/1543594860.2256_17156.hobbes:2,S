Hi,
I suggest the follwoing patch to make /proc/stat work as expected in 2.4.
I noted that "gkrellm" erroneously reported my disk hdc as hde. the reason
is that (a relict from the 2.2 series, I suppose) disk_index adds 2 to
the disk number for IDE controller 1. This is IMO wrong, because in 2.4
the disks are indexed by major and minor number.
I also added more major numbers to the routine and tried to order the
majors such that the "right" results are found quickly.
Regards,
Martin
