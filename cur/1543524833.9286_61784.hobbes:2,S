And little more, as a matter of fact. First of all, I made the
readprofile-2.1 version few years back with few improvements over the
old 2.0 version by somebody else. Since there doesn't seem to have been
any further development on the code, I am now releasing readprofile-3.0,
which is currently downloadable from 
http://www.nic.fi/~jsantala/linux
(This way I will also be able to trick you to visit my web-site once I
bother or feel like doing it;). The main new thing is that you can now
get a list of the tick-counts side-by-side with a disassembly of the
kernel code provided you have vmlinux file available. Few other
improvements have also been made. But please note, the original version
2.0 documents recommends setting readprofile suid root - DON'T EVER do
that. It's full of backdoors/security holes. The only reason you might
want to do this is reset the profiling counters (And why would you want
any user to be able to do it?) and if you absolutely need this ability,
set up a shell-script to do it.
Now, while testing the debugger I spotted some inefficiencies in the
current kernel as pertains to procps package and the /proc filesystem.
In short, it occurs the number of active processes in the system is
re-calculated each time any file is looked for in the /proc filesystem
root directory. In truth this count is only needed when the /proc
directory is statted, because the number of files in it depends on the
number of processes. However, where the recalculation code currently is,
it doesn't even quarantee the stat() output is right, and for example
with top running a significant amount of CPU is diverted to recalculate
the number of processes in the system times the number of processes in
the system, every second... Worse yet, the process table is locked
during this calculation.
What I've done is simply use the hooks provided in VFS-layer for network
file-systems to defer calculating the number of processes to stat()
time. The benefit is the system CPU-time spent while for example in top
is slightly reduced, and stat() on the proc filesystem root provides
more meaningful data.
After this change, it became apparent the radix-conversions first from
binary to decimal in kernel and then from decimal to binary in the top
program were next major CPU-hogs for top. Unfortunately
radix-conversions can't be, at least portably, optimized all that much.
However, I firmly believe every little bit helps... In fact an open
radix conversion is never needed in kernel. The target radix is always
8, 10 or 16. It is possible to hard-code these radixes into the macro
and let the compiler decide how to optimize them. 8 and 16 can be done
with plain shifts, and at least gcc is able to do away with imul even
for radix 10. In addition the digit-tables are really only needed for
radix beyond 10. It's possible to add a final case for radixes other
than 8, 10 and 16 to be on the safe side, but currently these aren't
used so I haven't.
