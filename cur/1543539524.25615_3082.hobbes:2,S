All -
I'm not sure if the error is in the loop.c or the cdrom code (or some
related bit..) or even if this is an 'error' at all.
Previously I was running a server on 2.2.15pre5 and updated to
2.2.17pre10 and then to 2.2.17pre13 where I'm currently at now.
The server is an FTP server for cdrom ISO images. Each CDROM ISO
(Made with xcdroast 0.96ex) is mounted against the loop dev with
the following command:
  mount -o loop,ro -t iso9660 mycdrom1.iso /mnt/cdiso1
The following message appears in my log for each ISO CDROM mounted (130
ISO CDROM images as of today.)
  Jul 22 00:39:41 linux kernel: Invalid session number or type of track
This message does not appear when mounting physical CDROM media from
/dev/cdrom. This message did not appear in 2.2.15pre5. I've only noticed
in 2.2.17pre10 and 2.2.17pre13.
Anyone give me a clue as to what it means and why it happens? A clue as to
how to make it stop would also do me good since at boot all 130 ISO images
get mounted and the messages just stream out to the console...
I haven't noticed any other problems aside from this. The mounted ISO
images appear to be fine after they mount.
Thanks for the help.
