Yeah, but the GPL requires availability of source, so I don't see how they
could get around that (it would no longer be a closed-source module and might
as well be GPL'd).
Hmm, does MODULE_LICENSE() actually state that the module is covered under
the GPL?  If not, could something like this work?

Of course this can still be circumvented by removing that string from
include/linux/module.h, but you'd still be able to identify renegade
modules, since they perpetrate as GPL'd modules.
