OK, I only wasn't sure this was considered before getting this
"not needed" verdict.
BTW, sometimes, even if something is very unlikely, but very
time-consuming, and skipping this isn't so costly, there could be
a gain at the end. So, maybe it's about individual cases and some
testing too? (At least, it seems, somebody found this so usable,
she/he bothered with such a long comment, and we know it's a last
thing any decent kernel hacker would care to do...)
