yes, the symptom is the same one, if you see rmmod in D state and
everything hangs reading /proc/modules you run into this exact deadlock,
I exclude it's another bug leading to the same symptom.  You'll also
find a modprobe in D state (that's because it's trying to read from
/proc/modules)

the critical info that you provided here (and the reason I wanted to
CC it back to l-k and Rusty and Al) is that it happend with other
modules too. I think very few people are running rmmod (not to tell now
there's an option to even forbid rmmod as a whole). hwinfo is one of the
few things doing rmmod and that's how it triggered the parport deadlock,
or we would not notice it. So it's hard to tell from my part how many of
the thousands kernel modules have this problem. Ideally a checker could
find any potential offender (it doesn't need to be an extremely smart
checker, false positives would be ok, but it needs at least some basic C
knowledge on calls to avoid any false negative). without a checker
giving some estimate I'm not very willing to drop my fix.
BTW, the new options in the module code sounds a bit overkill, I don't
see why there should be a kernel limitation for rmmod, I'd rather add an
userspace flag somewhere in modutils.conf to disable rmmod from
userspace so you don't have to recompile the kernel, at most it could be
a sysctl, nobody can ever ship kernels with rmmod disabled at compile
time anyways so it's pretty worthless.
Disabling modules at all at compile time, is an enterely different
matter, that's needed for super-security, not even a
write-once-then-readonly sysctl would be as safe as disabling modules
completely at compile time, since it would be too easy to sneak into
/dev/kmem and reset the sysctl, while if the code is not there, nobody
can use it.
