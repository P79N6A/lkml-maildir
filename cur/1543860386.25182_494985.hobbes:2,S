Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - Locking, whitespace, style, and hotplug fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This stuff is all post-2.6.20 material.
I'm fixing the locking through UML, and discovering other nastinesses along
the way.
Patches 1, 4, and 5 fix locking in the console and network drivers.
I have a huge raft of whitespace and style fixes which I will feed in as I
fix the locking in the same files.  The first installment of these are patches
3 and 6.
Patch 2 fixes problems getting hotplug errors back to the host, which I 
discovered while trolling through that code.
