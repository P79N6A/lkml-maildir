On i386 and x86_64 io_apic.c, see irq_pin_list
This advertises to support multiple pins per IRQ.
I suspect this code never runs, and simply adds
complexity to code that has no shortage of complexity.
If somebody can explain to me what a "shared ISA-space IRQ"
is supposed to be, I'm all ears.  I've had a BUG() in this
code for a while waiting for it to be used, and never seen it fire.
If we can get rid of that concept, then we have a 1:1 mapping
between irqs and apic:pin.  Possibly this simplification would
be helpful as we re-think how the mapping from cpu:vector -> irq works.
