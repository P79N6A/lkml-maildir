This is where we disagree obviously.  However, getting UBI into mainline
won't delay or prevent your proposal from getting done.  That's like
saying having ext3 in mainline prevents other filesystems from getting
created.  There is nothing wrong with having different subsystems that
overlap in a few areas.
What you're proposing seems like it would take at least several weeks to
even get close to what is needed in terms of reliability and the
required wear-leveling if it is indeed possible to implement.  And it
would likely duplicate some of the wear-leveling and bad block handling
code that is present in UBI anyway.  In the meantime, the need for UBI
exists today and there is a working, tested implementation available.
