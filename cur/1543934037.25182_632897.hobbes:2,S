I would default this option to not remove used symbols, because it
could break something.
For distributions it could be used in both ways:
* enabled -> only "distro approved" modules can be loaded
* disabled -> works as of now
For every other user who compiles own kernels without external modules
(Not including out-of-tree drivers that get patched into the kernel
code! Only modules that get compiled later independent from the kernel
build!) it will save space.
If this space would not matter there would be no need to be so hard on
currently unused EXPORT_SYMBOLs.
