The serial sonsole itself is disabled during suspend/resume, so you have to
hack the serial driver's suspend/resume routines to get any output on it
at that time. :-)
Anyway, if you want to put some debug printks somewhere, IMO a good place
to start is in resume_device() in drivers/base/power/resume.c or
in suspend_device() in drivers/base/power/suspend.c (actually, there already
is one, you only need to enable it).
Greets,
Rafael
