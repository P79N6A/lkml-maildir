I get this message when logging into a box via ssh.
the box is running 2.4 Kernel with devfsd installed on debian potato.
I have a *hunch* that this may be to do with devfsd, and the fact that devfsd 
is not creating the /dev/pts/x files correctly (or in a timely manner)
to prove this, I check the /dev/pts/ (and /dev-state/pts) dirs, prior to 
logging in on another xterm, make sure that all /dev/pty/ entries are used, 
and try logging in again. same error.
Now, when I try logging in on a new pts, it shows up in /dev-state/pts/ with 
root.root ownerships, and  crw-rw-rw- permissions.
in order to log in, I have to chown it to user.tty
any ideas what is going wrong? any suggestions to fix it?
Regards
Allen
