What about moving the calls to shrink_[di]cache_memory() after the
nr_pages check after the call to kmem_cache_reap?  Or perhaps keep it at
the beginning, but only call it after priority has gone a number of
notches down from DEF_PRIORITY?
Something like that seems like the only obvious way to balance how soon
these caches are flushed without over- or under-kill.
Also, shouldn't shrink_dqcache_memory use priority rather than
DEF_PRIORITY?  I'm also not sure what the reasoning is behind the
nr_pages=chunk_size reset.
In the case that Leigh and I are seeing (and my readprofile runs) it
sounds like shrink_cache is getting called a ton, while the bloated d/i
caches are flushed too little, too late.
Just $0.02 from a newby. ;)
Thanks for the tip, Mike,
