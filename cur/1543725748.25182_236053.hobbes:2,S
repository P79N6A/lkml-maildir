Isn't sysfs supposed to take care of this for us? IOW, I shouldn't have 
to call up to the SCSI midlayer from pcidev->suspend in order to notify 
it of a suspend, the midlayer should call the driver before we ever try 
to suspend. This may become important some day when the upper layers 
need to decide which order to bring pci devices down
Looking in /sys/devices shows that sysfs already knows that 'host0' is a 
child of a SCSI PCI device.
$ ls 
/sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:1e.0/0000\:02\:02.0/host0/0\:0\:0\:0/

delete  device_blocked  power  rescan       scsi_level  timeout  vendor
