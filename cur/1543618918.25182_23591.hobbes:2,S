Yes, that's an essential detail I omitted: when a page table's use count 
transitions from 1 to 2, mark all the CoW pages on the page table RO.

Yes, and after all, the whole point is to generalize CoW of pages to include 
instantiation of page tables.

Oh yes, it's what I intended, thanks.  Um, and I think you just told me what 
one of my bugs is.
