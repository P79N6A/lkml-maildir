I always wondered why there is no "grey out", at least optionaly.
My "favourite"(tm) example of a sub-marine is: Wireless drivers (mac80211).
The config-option to switch on the visibility of the mac80211 drivers 
("CONFIG_MAC80211") is conveniently located on the other side of the 
milky way.
(3 menus down, a sitestep and 2 up again. At least in menuconfig)
