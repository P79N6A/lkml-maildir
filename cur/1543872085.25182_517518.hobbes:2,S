Suggest something. (And then convince everyone who already set 
chaostables in stone to use the new name, namely search engines, 
bloggers, LWN, openwrt.) I don't think anyone seriously uses chaosnet 
nowadays. And just because there is a "quicktables" project does not 
mean there is a quick protocol filter.
Also note that the word 'chaostables' does not even appear in the patch, 
though xt_CHAOS does. Since we know that {xt,ipt}_[A-Z]+ are targets, we 
can safely assume that CHAOS does what it says - make fun of nmap.

It "wraps it all up", reducing the overall number of rules and user 
chains required in the filtering tables to implement the wanted logic. 
Reducing the number of filtering rules also reduces the time process a 
packet. These two are, in my opinion, a good thing.
Take xt_portscan as an example, which would require a minimum of 23 
filtering rules (which cannot reproduce the module's action in its 
fullest). 23 rules means we will be looping a bit in ipt_do_table() for 
a single packet, repeatedly checking for "-p tcp", i.e. calling into 
xt_tcpudp, checking for port ranges and perhaps other TCP fields that 
are never examined in xt_portscan.

Looking only at TCP,
REJECT sends a RST for any packet (if requested), or ICMP otherwise.
DELUDE sends a SYN-ACK on SYN, otherwise RST.
(And TARPIT, for reference, keeps the connection open anytime. Its code
is also quite a replication of REJECT.)
If you think it is better to merge the respond-with-SYNACK into REJECT 
rather than having DELUDE, say so.

On what basis? As far as I flew over psd's code, it uses a heuristic 
like "how often did that client recently connect" for match decision. 
(P2P clients randomly port knocking, anyone?) I would not think of that 
as a reliable way to tell portscans either. However, half-open TCP 
connect for example is a more clear action to define a portscan.
