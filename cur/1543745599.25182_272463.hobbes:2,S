Linux Gurus,
I am new to linux kernel, trying to work on my
academic
project. 
I have one basic question:
I downloaded latest 2.6.9 kernel. Compiled it and 
did make modules, make modules_install. Then I 
upgraded the grub. Everything was OK till:
When I tried to reboot with 2.6.9 kernel, it was
trying
load 2.6.4-52/.../reiserfs.ko and failing.
My question is I already did make odlconfig;make;make
modules;make modules_install; updated grub,image,
system.map. Is there any thing missing because of
which
it is trying to load module from old
/lib/modules/2.6.4-52/....
And Why it is not picking up from 2.6.9/.../ .
Any help would be really appriciated.
Please mail me at dude_linux@yahoo.com as I did't
subscribe.
Regards
Dude_linux.
