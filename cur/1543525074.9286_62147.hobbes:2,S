   At least your talking to me again now -- this is progress.  Nobody ever
   attacked anything, I asked questions about your stuff, you guys take
   everything so personal -- it's not personal -- it's just business.  
If calling the entire linux kernel development community "second-rate
Unix hackers" is just business, and not something to be taken
personally, remind me never to invest in your company.....  it's
certainly not smart business, at any rate.

P.S.  If Ray Noorda is really funding this character, someone with his
e-mail address (perhaps at Caldera) should forward some of the e-mail on
this thread to him.  He should know where his money is going.
