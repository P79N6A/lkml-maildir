Caveats:
  * No current support for the popular (for DSL) Efficient-25 cards.
    I think some people are working on a driver, but I don't think it's
    production-ready.  I'm betting it will be done soon.  It does support
    the IDT Nicstar based ones such as the ForeRunner LE though.
  * No PPP-over-ATM support.  I posted a first cut at this this morning.
    Hopefully I'll have something working soon.
  * No bridged-ethernet-over-ATM support.  I described some hacks to make
    this work a while back on the linux-atm list (check the archives).
    After I hash out PPP I'll probably look at adding more formal support.
Further questions about ATM support should be directed at the linux-atm
mailing list (again, see above URL)
