Hi all,
    Currently, I'm studying the code of the sysfs. But I got the
following questions:
1. What is the d_alloc_root used for? Actually, the question should
be: why we have to call d_alloc_root. I think the root already has its
dentry, why we have to allocate another while we mounting a file
system?
2. Why we call d_alloc_root to allocate a dentry for the mount point
while the usual mount point of sysfs is defined by the user (something
like /sysfs but not /). See below:
	root = d_alloc_root(inode);
	if (!root) {
		pr_debug("%s: could not get root dentry!\n",__FUNCTION__);
		iput(inode);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
	root->d_fsdata = &sysfs_root;
	sb->s_root = root;
does this means settting the sysfs' mount point to "/" but not "/sysfs".
Thanks.
