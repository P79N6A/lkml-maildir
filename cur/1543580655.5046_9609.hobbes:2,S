SWC = Scaleable Web Cache
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/iis/swc2.asp
 has more information about
SWC 2.0. Microsoft published SpecWeb96 results for IIS+SWC 2.0, but not
for SpecWeb99. I would guess that SWC 2.0 didn't help performance for
dynamic content.
Looks like they fixed this with SWC 3.0.
