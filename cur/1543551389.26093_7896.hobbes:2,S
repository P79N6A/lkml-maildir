   David, you know this code, would you mind giving it another pair of
   eyes?  I hate code that doesn't make sense.
Ok, the deal is that the tpnt->present handling during unregister is
really broken.  There is no way for the "if" conditional in question
to differentiate between the following two cases:
1) No host adapters for this tpnt were ever registered
2) All host adapters for this tpns were successfully
   removed by this loop above the test in question:
	/* Next we go through and remove the instances of the individual hosts
	 * that were detected */
	pcount0 = next_scsi_host;
	for (shpnt = scsi_hostlist; shpnt; shpnt = sh1) {
Both events leave us with tpnt->present == 0, but only in the #2 case
do we want to do the unlink and procfs deletions.
It's very easy to fix, Torben can you try this (untested) patch?
