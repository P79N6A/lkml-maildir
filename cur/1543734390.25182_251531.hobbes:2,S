My fault there :( Sorry.

Hmm. I'll take your word for it, I'm not quite grasping it,
but you know quite a bit more about it then I do :) I would
have thought once a close is sent, the data has all been received
and/or sent anyway, so what would corrupt?

It _appears_ that when we close a socket (ie with mysql_close) on
the client side, the client side closes the FD properly (though Mysql
doesn't), and then if we call connect (which it does a lot, being a proxy
server) it will reuse that FD. At this point, the Mysql side still hasn't
closed it, and it is sitting in CLOSE_WAIT, where it remains forever, since
it is in use by the client side elsewhere already. Should connect be
checking the "list of not connected, but state other then CLOSED" list
before it decides to use a particular FD? Or is this behavior intentional?

Fair enough, thank you for clarifying it for me :)
Keep up the good work :) (which you do a lot of I might add :)
