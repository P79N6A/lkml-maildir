It would be nice to be able to select a minimum CPU target (implies
gcc's -march=xxx), and then a set of CPU targets >= the minimum.  Sample
'make config' dialog:
	Processor family (386, 486/Cx486, 586/K5/5x86/6x86, ...]: 586
	PPro features? [Y/n]
	P-II features? [Y/n]
	3Dnow features? [Y/n]
And then a runtime switch (like the Alpha's machine vector) would select
the features to use upon bootup.  That should make CPU-specific feature
addition easier and more modular.
