Bob Wilson made some changes to binutils last week to address this 
problem but he only submitted it to the latest binutils version.
With the latest gcc+binutils toolchain, the kernel compiles for me.
Note, however, that I just submitted a patch that is not in Linus' tree, 
yet.
gcc version 3.4.5 20050707 (prerelease)
GNU ld version 2.16.91 20050707
Thanks,
Chris
