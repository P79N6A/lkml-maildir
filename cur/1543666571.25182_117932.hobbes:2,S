Yeah!
Oh, and while I was sending this, I thought I'd ask a question.
Regarding the folks who still say "not good enough", might it be
possible to export bk metadata into, say, a compressed file in each
subdir in the repository? Such a file would contain any relevant bk
metadata for files in that subdir.
I don't know if that's something one would want to do for performance
reasons or otherwise, but it sound like the thing that would finally
quiet those who are complaining.
Good work! I hope BitchKeeper turns out just as nice.
