 same Omnibook problem as reported for mm1-mm3. If local APIC is
enabled in kernel config and "nolapic" is specified on boot line, the
notbook will hang in the Bogomips calibration loop.
 Only solutions so far are "acpi=no" (but no "nolapic") or taking local
APIC out of the configuration (which I will do from now on).
Cheers
Martin
