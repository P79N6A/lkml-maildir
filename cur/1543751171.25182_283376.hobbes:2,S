Sorry, correction: pm_register() is used for both ISA PnP and non-PnP
devices.

Yep.

This looks easier to implement as a temporary solution until ISA bus
is implemented.  We know how many instances are to be initiailized in
advance, so each driver object can have a unique name.

Well, I don't think this can be problematic on ISA soundcards with
platform_device.  Anyway, I'll try to implement platform_device at
first as a test...
Thanks!
