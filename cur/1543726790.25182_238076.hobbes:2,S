ok, found it - it's a false positive in commit.c due to need_resched()
not doing a touch_preempt_timing(). Newest patch at:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/preempt-timing-on-2.6.8-rc2-O2
i changed need_resched() to do a touch_preempt_timing() - this also got
rid of some other changes. All code i checked really takes
need_resched() seriously if it looks at it - any reason why you didnt
add this to need_resched() before?
