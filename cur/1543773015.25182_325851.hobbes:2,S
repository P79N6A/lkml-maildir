Hi
I've used quilt to et to the patch that is causing problems (quilt is great thanx Andrew). This is the sequence, which led me to
the possible culprit:
push 410, pop 205, pop 103, push 103, pop 51, pop 26, push 13, pop 6, push 4 and push 1
This points to: randomisation-top-of-stack-randomization.patch
