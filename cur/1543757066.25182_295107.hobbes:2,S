Thank-you, thank-you.  <blush>
What about the suggestion I had that you sort of skipped over, which
amounted to changing the system call from a node array to just one
node:
    sys_page_migrate(pid, va_start, va_end, count, old_nodes, new_nodes);
to:
    sys_page_migrate(pid, va_start, va_end, old_node, new_node);
Doesn't that let you do all you need to?  Is it insane too?
