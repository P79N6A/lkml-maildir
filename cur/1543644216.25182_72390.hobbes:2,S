The old file.

How about a facility to create the character (or block?) special file
node right there in the driverfs directory?  Optional of course.
The deal being that we really don't want to care at all about major
or minor numbers.  If you only add minor, major remains an issue.
If you add both, then the problem is where to find the darn device
special file.  If you add the device (special) file ... then it's easy
for device drivers to migrate!  'devlabel' or somesuch could manage
symlinks to "user friendly names" using class level hotplug events,
and smarter apps would start to scan driverfs directly.
