I just did a test merge with today's linux-next and though thee are a few
conflicts, it is not to much for me to handle - I have had worse :-)

I would much prefer a few conflicts to carrying a post linux-next patch
because linux-next can change radically day to day - especially since we
know there will be clashes in the areas of files you would be patching.
So lets use the above git tree and see how we go. OK?
