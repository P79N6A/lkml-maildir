Amusingly, 8139too had to deal with the exact same problem.  At the 
time, we chose to obtain the subsystem vendor/device ids, and list them 
that way:
         /* some crazy cards report invalid vendor ids like
          * 0x0001 here.  The other ids are valid and constant,
          * so we simply don't match on the main vendor id.
          */
         {PCI_ANY_ID, 0x8139, 0x10ec, 0x8139, 0, 0, RTL8139 },
         {PCI_ANY_ID, 0x8139, 0x1186, 0x1300, 0, 0, RTL8139 },
         {PCI_ANY_ID, 0x8139, 0x13d1, 0xab06, 0, 0, RTL8139 },
Given that the subsystem vendor ids in particular were sane and valid in 
each case, this seemed narrow enough to avoid false positives.
Regardless, I agree with your "you...have a return candidate" comment.
