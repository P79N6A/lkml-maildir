This is different by a shade.
It would be one thing to have a struct with BINARY code to load that was
in a GPL C file, the other is having a binary-image that is
attached/linked to a kernel.  Lastly if this if never going to be a device
that is needed until the completion of the kernel launch, then it is a
DGD, 'don't give a damn'.  Because we can insert a stripping probe and
convert the image to something that is usable and safe.
If it is a firmware image, put another fpga on it and store it there.
