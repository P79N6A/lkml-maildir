Hello,
  The following patch set adds a fork connector in the do_fork()
routine to 2.6.12-rc1-mm3 kernel. 
  We provide two patches. The first one is the fork connector
implementation and the second one fix a bug in the connector.c. The
second patch has been sent by Evgeniy Polyakov for inclusion and should
be in the next -mm release. While it's not included, we provide it with
the fork connector to allow people to use and test the fork connector.
  Those patches apply to 2.6.12-rc1-mm3.
Best regards,
Guillaume
