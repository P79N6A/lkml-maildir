[PATCH] I2C: Fix MAX6657/8/9 detection in lm90
I received no additional feedback about my MAX6657/8/9 detection fix.
Since it was correct for the only chips I got a report for, I propose we
apply it. After all, maybe people don't know they have such a chip
because the detection was previously not correct.
The patch below is the one I sent to the LM Sensors and Linux Kernel
mailing-lists two weeks ago, unchanged. Thanks.
