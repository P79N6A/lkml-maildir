One thing that's worth pointing out is that sometimes the 20-line patch is
sufficient to solve the problem, but is lousy code. That's fine for a tree
that will be frozen in a couple of months after only getting little fixes
to other files, but mainline should get a real fix, which wouldn't be
acceptable in the sucker tree. So 2.6.(x+1) shouldn't automatically get
2.6.x.y. Should reverting a 200-line patch which turned out to need
another 200 lines to work be acceptable?

Similar rule for driver patches: you can patch a driver if it makes the 
device not work (but you couldn't patch the core)?

The good patches will show up in 2.6.(x+1).1, which should be
sufficient. It's not the same sucker tree, but it's a sucker tree.
