Hey,
I'm trying to get 2.4.21 to run (2.4.20 runs nicely), and I get the
above error ("/bin/insmod.old: file not found"), after which it stops
booting.
After that, I installed the newest modutils (2.4.25) and
module-init-tools (tried both 0.9.12 and 0.9.13-pre), created symlinks
in /bin for all *mod* tools pointing to /sbin/$file, and I still cannot
get 2.4.21 to get further than this error (obviously, /bin/insmod.old
_is there_, I'm not that stupid. ;) ). I use initrd with filesystem
modules and some more in it, so obviously it fails with a panic saying
that /sbin/init wasn't found (no single HD mounted).
Of course, I could place ext3 in-kernel, but that's not the point.
2.4.21 doesn't boot for me as is - 2.4.20 does. I can't continue 2.5.x
testing if I remove the module-init-tools and only use modutils (I'm
doing that on another system, and that one works well with 2.4.21).
Does this sound familiar to anyone? Does someone know a solution that
will allow me to keep on using initrd images in 2.4.x, while also being
able to test 2.5.x?
System: RH73 (mostly), gcc-2.96.
Thanks,
Ronald
