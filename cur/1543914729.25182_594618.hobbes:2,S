It also has the benefit of not requiring an initialization protocol, and
of reducing complaints about the hypervisor injecting code into the guest.

I definitely want kvm to be able to emulate the Xen hypercall interface,
but there's no need to allow both concurrently.  So I'd say use
0x40000000 for detection and the rest cannot clash because detection fails.
