Hmmm. What if when you created a new, exclusive CPUset, the cpus you spec'ed
were *removed* from the parent CPUset (and existing processes forcibly
migrated off). That'd fix most of it, and would bring us much closer to the
true meaning of "exclusive". Changes your semantics a bit, but still ...
OK, so there is one problem I can see - you couldn't remove the last CPU
from the parent if there were any jobs running in it, but presumably fixable
(eg you have to move them into the created child, or fail the call).
