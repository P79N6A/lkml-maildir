Hmm, what is this "vmalloc_to_page" and in what tree do we find it?
Is this a case of BitKeeper users getting ahead of the game?
I ask because I was preparing mail and patch to replace Arjan's
uvirt-to-kva-2.5.5-A0 (and those parts of your highmem-2.5.5-A0).
In brief, I contend that
unsigned long uvirt_to_kva(pgd_t *pgd, unsigned long adr)
is not appropriate or useful for mm/memory.c to provide, but
struct page *vvirt_to_page(unsigned long vadr)
is appropriate and useful for mm/vmalloc.c to provide.
Is that what your "vmalloc_to_page" is?  If so, why are you also
marketing "uvirt_to_kva"?  If not, sorry for all the confusion!
Thanks,
Hugh
