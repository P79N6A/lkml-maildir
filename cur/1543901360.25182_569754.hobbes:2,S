yes, the weight multiplier 1.25, but the actual difference in CPU 
utilization, when running two CPU intense tasks, is ~10%:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 8246 mingo     20   0  1576  244  196 R   55  0.0   0:11.96 loop
 8247 mingo     21   1  1576  244  196 R   45  0.0   0:10.52 loop
so the first task 'wins' +10% CPU utilization (relative to the 50% it 
had before), the second task 'loses' -10% CPU utilization (relative to 
the 50% it had before).
so what the comment says is true:
 * The "10% effect" is relative and cumulative: from _any_ nice level,
 * if you go up 1 level, it's -10% CPU usage, if you go down 1 level
 * it's +10% CPU usage.
for there to be a ~+10% change in CPU utilization for a task that races 
against another CPU-intense task there needs to be a ~25% change in the 
weight.
