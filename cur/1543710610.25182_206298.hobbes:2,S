There is a patch which arranges to keep statistics ready in the mm so that
the mmap_sem need not be taken for /proc/ and furthermore renders
proc_pid_statm() nothing more than copying integers out of the mm that
I forward ported to 2.6.0-test*, originally by Ben LaHaise, that may
also be of interest to those concerned about tripping over other processes'
mmap_sem's in /proc/.
