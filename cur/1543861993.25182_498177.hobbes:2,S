Ouch. However, I think your patch is bogus.
You're fixing somethign that doesn't need fixing: <linux/uaccess.h> 
already includes <linux/preempt.h> for the preemption functions.
The REAL problem seems to be that the m68k preempt.h (or rather, to be 
exact, asm/thread_info.h) doesn't do things right, and while it exposes 
"inc_preempt_count()", it doesn't expose enough information to actually 
use it.
I think your "current_thread_info()" is broken.
