There's no wakeup signal, so no possibility of a wakeup race. That's 
why we schedule_timeout() instead of wait_event() or similar. This code 
is only used to flush the console when the kernel crashes, so we can 
get the full oops, so waiting a little bit too long is acceptable.
Your suggested change is perhaps more idiomatic though, and less 
jarring for reviewers. :-)
Thanks for your comments by the way. Reviewing lots of patches isn't 
much fun.
