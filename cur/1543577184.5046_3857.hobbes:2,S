That's new info ... you'd previously thought that it wasn't even
invoking /sbin/hotplug!
The scripts I know about will produce that message when they're
invoked without PCI_CLASS set.  That's a sanity check which was
needed for the intial PCI hotplug support, which wouldn't pass
that info -- needed to hotplug devices using class drivers, such
as USB host controllers.
But they'll also dump all the arguments and environment of
hotplug before they get that far, if you set DEBUG=yes; please
enable that and let us know the whole environment that's getting
passed !

p.s. Re that patch Andrew mentioned, it shouldn't have made
    a difference unless "PCI_CLASS=%04X" truncated the top
    eight bits of the class (it's 24 bits, not 16:  8 bits
    each of class, subclass, prog-if.)  That would have had a
    different failure mode:  only class 0 devices (pci.ids
    says is "unclassified" devices) would PCI hotplug.
