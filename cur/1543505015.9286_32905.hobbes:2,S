Where do these numbers come from?  (other than
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/socket.h and
/usr/include/socketbits.h...by-the-way, why are they defined,
sometimes differently, in the two files?)  Do we get numbers from
IANA, or are these implementation specific?

Additionally, I have seen and am using PF_KEY=15 (RFC2367).
Currently, our PF_KEYv2 is part of the 'ipsec' module, but should be
separated at some point into 'key' since it is a generic keying
interface.
