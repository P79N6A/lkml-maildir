A little, but we were talking more about the interface than the
implementation.

I believe there is already a kprobes patch in the queue for
enumerating active probes in some /proc file.  Should a module be
locked into memory for such a reason, finding the culprit should not
be difficult.

One problem with this idea is that if the unregister_fast()=disable()
is to become reversible, then the renamed commit_kprobes() will no
longer be indempotent.  There can no longer be a single system-wide
deferred-kprobe-cleanup list, since individual kprobes clients might
want to reinstate their probes in the future.

But this would solve both problems (memory leaks and outstanding
reference counts on modules).  In this variant,
unregister_kprobes_fast could replace unregister_kprobes outright, and
the (builtin deferred) commit function would need not be exported.
