Sure, there's nothing wrong with keeping "ongoing development" around, and 
then just asking me to pull the unrelated fixes. 
Either using separate patches to synchronize the bugfixes, or just using 
separate git branches for development and merging up to me. As usual, Jeff 
ends up the poster-boy for git branches (these days there are certainly 
others that do it too, but Jeff has done it more and for longer than 
most).
For example, going to Jeff's networking tree:
	
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git;a=summary
you can see
	15 hours ago 	ALL 		shortlog | log
	15 hours ago 	e100-sbit 	shortlog | log
	16 hours ago 	upstream-linus 	shortlog | log
	16 hours ago 	upstream 	shortlog | log
	20 hours ago 	master 		shortlog | log
	4 days ago 	sky2 		shortlog | log
	4 days ago 	sis900-wol 	shortlog | log
	4 days ago 	8139-thread 	shortlog | log
where "upstream-linus" is the part I merged today, while he has possibly 
other development work in the other branches.
