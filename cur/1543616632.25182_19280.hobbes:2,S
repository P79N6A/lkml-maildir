True.  I was assuming that the context of the post was
that the NICs were on the same network link.    
Solaris _defaults_ to using the MAC address from the 
primary (hostname) NIC for the rest of them.   IMHO, this 
is a really stupid thing to do, and  I disable it tout de suite
when given a choice.   Of course, if you like it, then
why don't you try to convince Linus to change his mind 
about it?
