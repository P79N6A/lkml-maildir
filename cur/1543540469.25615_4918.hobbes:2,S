Make sure you use 3c59x driver, not the 3c90x driver from 3com.

Neighbour timeouts are currently not propagated to the routing code,
so it will only change on explicit interface down.

Load balancing, and failover with routing daemons that support it (which
is currently none as far as I know, a few people were writing their own
primitive daemons to just check for nexthop alive)
