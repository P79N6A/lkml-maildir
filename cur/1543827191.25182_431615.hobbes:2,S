The potential problem with this is that system administrator may never
realize that the filesystem is just getting silently skipped.  (And a
big fat warning printed by e2fsck doesn't help when distro's like
Ubuntu use a graphical boot sequence that hides warning messages
printed by e2fsck).
Is it really that hard to edit /etc/fstab so that the fsck pass is
skipped?  
I might be willing to make it be a configurable option in
/etc/e2fsck.conf, but it *is* dangerous to have e2fsck exit with
success without having actually checked the filesystem.
