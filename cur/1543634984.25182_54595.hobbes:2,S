No, not quite.   The HCD accelerates the URBs to completion if the device
is removed with an URB pending on it.  It therefore shouldn't hang for the
timeout -- if you're seeing this behavior, then the HCD is broken.

The reason it was moved up was to save lots of processing (including memory
allocation paths) if the abort had already been requested.  Which is a
common case.

There was a large discussion of this in relation to another driver on
linux-usb-devel... basically, the pointer is just an address to a structure
owned by an HCD... it's entirely possible for the structure to go away on
us unexpectedly.  We _should_ get the notification via the _disconnect()
call, but real-world experience showed us that this wasn't always
happening.
