I've profiled this and know the memory stats don't do any harm; the
rest I'd have to see profiled. AFAICT all the damage is done after
ticking mm->rss in the various pagetable copying/blitting operations,
and once we've taken that hit (in mainline!) the other counters are
noise-level. The integral counters are another story; I've not seen
those in action.
