oh don't get me wrong, it's important to not copy from the original.
(even if that original did copy from linux ;)

yet at the same time, the cleanroom approach is not the ONLY way to do
it right. And making following that exact approach a strict requirement
is just silly. And it would mean we'd need to remove quite a few drivers
from the tree if you follow that logic.
And to be fair the pwc camera driver was just a guy with a personality
problem rather than any real legal standing. 
Again doing things right is important. But I would say that if you do
the rev-engineering in Europe, just being careful and avoiding copying
should be enough (well and certifying that you were in fact careful and
didn't do any copying).
