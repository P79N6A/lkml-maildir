No, I specifically directed the scheduler to run my thread at a higher 
priority than any other userspace application.  The fact that I wrote it 
in userspace and not in kernel space implies that I am OK with the kernel
stopping me sometimes when _it_ has work to do.  If I wanted something
higher priority than the kernel I would have written something in kernel
space instead.

That is SOOOO broken it isn't even funny.

Yeah, thats broken too.
Perhaps I don't understand this philosophy you have where the kernel
isn't more important than everything else.  It seems to me like there needs
to be a rigid hierarchy for scheduling, lest you get into deadlock problems:
1.  Kernel preempts all.  There may be some hierarchy of kernel priorities
too, but it isn't important here.
2.  SCHED_FIFO processes preempt all userspace applications.
3.  SCHED_RR.
4.  SCHED_OTHER.
Under no circumstances should any single CPU-bound userspace thread completely 
hose a 64-way SMP box.
Can somebody educate me on why it is correct to do it any other way?
Chad
