Pete Zaitcev gave me some great advice, when I joined Red Hat.  Manage 
your bugs aggressively, sometimes with a sharp and pointy stick. 
Otherwise they will become unkillable nine-headed hydra with a life of 
their own, as the bugs drift further and further away from the original 
bug reporter's bug.  ;-)  Open new bugs if a poster's issue seems 
remotely different from the base bug.  Bugzilla can do fancy stuff like 
linking bugs into dependency chains, and also marking bugs as 
duplicates.  The power is yours :)
