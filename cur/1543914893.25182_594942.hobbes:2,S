hmm, it was a long time ago. This one looks like 4MB large pages so

Yes. I can enforce a similar situation but didn't because the evacuation
costs could not be justified for hugepage allocations. Patches to do such
a thing were prototyped a long time ago and abandoned based on cost. For
large blocks, there may be a justification.

This picture is not grouping pages by mobility so that is hardly a
suprise. This picture is not running grouping pages by mobility. This is
what the normal kernel looks like. Look at the videos in
http://www.skynet.ie/~mel/anti-frag/2007-02-28
 and see how list-based
compares to vanilla. These are from February when there was less control
over mixing blocks than there is today.
In the current version mixing occurs in the lower blocks as much as possible
not the upper ones. So there are a number of mixed blocks but the number is
kept to a minimum.
The number of mixed blocks could have been enforced as 0, but I felt it was
better in the general case to fragment rather than regress performance.
That may be different for large blocks where you will want to take the
enforcement steps.

We don't take defrag steps at the moment at all. There are memory
compaction patches but I'm not pushing them until we can prove they are
necessary.

As I said elsewhere, you can try this easily on top of grouping pages by
mobility. They are not mutually exclusive and you'll have a comparison
point.

Ok, get it implemented so and we'll try it out because we're just hand-waving
here and not actually producing anything to compare. It'll be interesting
to see how it works out for large blocks and hugepages (although I expect
the latter to fail unless grouping pages by mobility is in place).  Ideally,
they'll complement each other nicely but only ever having mixing take place
at the 64KB boundary. I have the testing setup necessary for checking
out hugepages at least and I hope to put together something that tests
large blocks as well. Minimally, running the hugepage allocation tests
on a filesystem using large blocks would be a decent starting point.
