StarOffice only works with the old glibc by chance.  There is simply no way 
you can upgrade a library and maintain 100% compatibility in the face of 
all the possible stupid things that a user binary can do - the only way you 
can be sure that two libraries will behave precisely the same is if they 
*are* precisely the same.
However, we are prepared to sacrifice that 100% compatibility and draw a line 
somewhere.  For example, we assume that if a user program has hardwired 
knowledge of the memory address in glibc where a particular variable lives in 
some version, it is making unacceptable demands on the library and we won't 
feel obliged to try to guarantee that it continues working.  Similarly if it 
"knows" what the layout of a FILE structure is and starts directly modifying 
its fields.  The only promises that are made about the interface to newer C 
libraries are the interface definitions set out in the documentation.
Using internal C library symbols (anything beginning with an underscore for 
example) is another way in which a user program can poke at the unpublished
details of the libc.  This is also unacceptable.  To discourage this, as of 
glibc 2.1 these internal symbols are simply not visible to such programs.
StarOffice tries to refer to __libc_init and __setfpucw at least; maybe 
others.  Its installer also looks explicitly for "libpthread-0.7.so".  None of 
these are details that a well behaved program should concern itself with.
A glib answer like "glibc 2.1 is broken" helps nobody.  If you really believe 
that the library is at fault, take the time to investigate the problem and 
suggest a way to fix it.
(This discussion has nothing to do with the kernel.  Please don't cc the
