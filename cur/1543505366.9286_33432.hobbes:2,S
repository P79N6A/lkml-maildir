Hi
Anyone else seen this? When running ps, top etc. the process would hang
(unkillably) and the load average would go up a notch. Kernel 2.3.12 on
a (single) Pentium II 350, 64M RAM and a mostly Redhat 5.2 with bits of
RH 6 distribution.
Scroll-lock tricks revealed that the processes trying to read proc were
all stuck in the D state. I could quite happily start other processes
though eg. xterms.
I haven't tried to reproduce it again - 2.3.13 was out and so I'm
running that now instead with no problems yet.
Thank you,
PS. Please cc me directly for a quick reply. My lists mail goes to a
machine that I only get to read infrequently ...
