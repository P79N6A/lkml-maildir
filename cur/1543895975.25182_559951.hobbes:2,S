The implementation was below in the email. Full preemption was enabled.

Thanks for the advice, but please have a look at my follow-up on the
issue, where I spotted the problem more precisely. It also affects
ioremap, which also uses global_flush_tlb(). I guess this bug is worth
being fixed quickly, even if it is just by applying my workaround (which
is _really_ conservative).
