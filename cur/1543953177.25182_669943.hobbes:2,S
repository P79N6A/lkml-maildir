Hello; fair enough, I did ask ati about what I should do, but there
wasn't much help. Overall its not pretty, but If you are impatient for
ati to come out with an update then this should get you going(for 3D).
The problem I see is, SELinux is going out of whack due to fglrx
wanting a cap_t effective vector.  So on the secure side I probably
wont use fglrx until there is support for the proper capability.
or take you're approach and look at the open ati driver.
