It is certainly an information leak not otherwise available. And with
the ability to change the layout underneath, you might trigger bugs in
root programs: Are they really capable of seeing the same filename
twice, or can you throw them into a deep recursion by simulating
infinitely deep directories/circular hardlinks...?
Certainly a useful tool for hardening applications, but I can see the
point of not wanting to let unwary applications run into a namespace
controlled by a user. Of course, this is sort-of similar to "find
-xdev", but I'm not sure whether it is not indeed new behaviour.
