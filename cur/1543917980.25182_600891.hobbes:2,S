IRQ_NOBALANCING is not preventing cpu unplug. It moves the affinity to the 
next CPU, but the check in NMI watchdog for CPU == 0 would not longer 
work.
Fix below. Post .23 material. I work out a separate one for the x8664 
clock events series.

[PATCH] i386: Fix nmi watchdog per cpu timer irq accounting
The clock events patches changed the interrupt distribution and the
local apic timer interrupt accounting for the broadcast case. The per
cpu clock events handler of the cpu, which runs the broadcast
interrupt, is executed directly in the broadcast irq context. This
does not invoke the low level arch code, which does the local apic
timer irq accounting. The work around for false positives in the nmi
watchdog was to add the irq0 interrupts (broadcast device) to the
local apic timer interrupts. This falsifies the results for the CPUs
which are not handling the broadcast interrupt, i.e. stuck CPUs might
be not detected, as noticed by Andi Kleen.
It would be possible to move the clockevents handler invocation of the
CPU which runs the broadcast interrupt into the tick device broadcast
function, but this would require to handle the per cpu device to this
function and perform the direct operation in the clock device specific
architecture code. Right now this is only i386 and x86_64, but MIPS is
on the way to use the broadcast mode as well.
Introduce a weak function tick_broadcast_account(), which allows x86
to adjust the local apic timer interrupt counter in the case when the
cpu local timer handler has been invoked. This keeps the cpu local
handler decision and invocation in the common code and allows x86 to
handle the nmi watchdog accounting correctly.
