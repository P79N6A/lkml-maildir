I did a test. I disabled readahead except for reading all 4 buffers in
map_4sectors.
I observed 14% slowdown on walking directories with find and 4% slowdown
on grepping one my working directory (10M, 281 files).
If you can't make it otherwise you can rip readahead out. If there is a
possibility to keep it, it would be better.
