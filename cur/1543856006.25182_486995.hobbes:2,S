Subject: [PATCH] Video Select set for VESA FB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	This patch automatically set VIDEO_SELECT when you select VESA FB. 
Currently if you select VESA FB with fbcon but don't select VGA console 
the box will not have its video mode set. Thus you get a blank screen.
Please apply.
