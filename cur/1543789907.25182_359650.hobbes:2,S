Luben,
to be honest, a lot of people got exactly the impression that you've
been doing that from the start in this saga, by attacking Christophs and
James' integrity early on etc. Jeff has been just about the only person
who ignored that and kept talking to you, and now you're attacking him
too... I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve. But I'm pretty sure
this way isn't the best or easiest way to achieve that.
