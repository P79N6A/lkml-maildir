Don't call it {KDB,KGDB,DEBUG}_VECTOR, call it NMI_VECTOR, which is
what it really is.  default_do_nmi() determines if the nmi is due to a
debugger or some other event.  That requires the debuggers to record if
they are expecting their own nmi, putting all the load on the
debuggers, where it belongs.
IOW, add NMI_VECTOR to the base code, then add debugger support on top of
NMI_VECTOR.
