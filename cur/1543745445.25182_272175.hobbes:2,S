Hi,
I have been observing that locally generated packets with a local destination
have they don't pop up in the nat/PREROUTING chain.
Anybody know why this is done? (If not, it's a bug.)
As a side observation, those packets have source ip == destination ip, so if I
telnet to '127.0.0.44', a LOG target says SRC=127.0.0.44 and DST=127.0.0.44.
Should not be SRC always be 127.0.0.1?
