Subject: [BK PATCH] pcibios_* removals for 2.5.40
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's some changesets that remove the pcibios_find_class(),
pci_find_device(), and pcibios_present() functions.  These functions
have been marked as obsolete since the 2.2 kernel, so it's about time
that we removed them.
Please pull from:  
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
