The command
  more foo/* foo/*/* 
will display the values in the foo subtree nicely, I think.
Think of the /proc tree as the XML parse tree already exploded for you.
The only problem with /proc as it stands is that there is no formal
syntax for its entries.  Some of them are hard to parse.
Before we add a new /proc entry that generates XML which summarizes
the rest of /proc, it might make sense to standardize /proc entries
and write a regression test to verify they are formatted correctly.
It would then be trivial to write a /proc to XML converter which
ran solely in userspace.
See 
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0101.0/0506.html
and
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&s=%2Fproc+xml
for prior discussion on the matter.
I don't want to dismiss the reasons you want to use XML for this,
but tread carefully, lest you duplicate lots of code and introduce
cruft.  Better to factor the XML part out to a userspace library...
