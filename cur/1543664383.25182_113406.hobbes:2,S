How about by not allowing your system to excessively overcommit.
Everything else is armwaving "works half the time" stuff. By the time
the OOM kicks in the game is already over. The rlimit one doesnt deal
with things like fork explosions where you have lots of processes
all under 1/4 of the rlimit range who cumulatively overcommit. In
fact you now pick harder on other tasks...
