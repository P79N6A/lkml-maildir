I think that'd be Reviewed-By.  While you are not part of the smokey room
cabal you have shown technical expertise in various areas so it seems
perfectly fine to have reviewed-by from you.  The fix vs a previous version
should probably be just in the text with a paragraph ala:
Issue blah in a previous version as found by Valdis Kletnieks has been fixed
by doing foo.
