Hi,
2.5.49-mm1 works ok here (shpte enabled too).  I see two frustrating problems left
with the modules change (user perspective).  The most irratating one is messages like:
FATAL: Error inserting /lib/modules/2.5.49-mm1/kernel/ac97_codec.o: Invalid module format
I get this on about 10% of the modules I want to load.  How do I fix it?
The second is that automatic loading is not working.  Manually loading modules is a PITA.
What plans are there to fix this?
TIA
Ed Tomlinson
