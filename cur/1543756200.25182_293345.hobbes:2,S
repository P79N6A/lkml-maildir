 That might actually be useful to support some weird hardware.  E.g. I 
have a single-function PCI device which reports as a graphics adapter 
(either VGA or other, depending on the configuration), but besides the 
actual graphics adapter the chip includes a frame grabber, an USB host 
controller, an Ethernet interface, an IEEE 1284 parallel port, an UART, an 
I2C controller and a PS/2 keybard/mouse controller. ;-)  All of these 
mapped with a single PCI BAR; the chip can also be configured for legacy 
mapping of some devices, like the PS/2 stuff.
