I think you should try it anyway, using all the options, because it is 
very likely that your card might be compatible with one of the listed 
ones. This is specially true if you don't care about the tuner.
Just modprobe the bttv module with card=X option, test it, rmmod it, 
modprobe it again with card=X+1, etc., until you find a number that fits.
