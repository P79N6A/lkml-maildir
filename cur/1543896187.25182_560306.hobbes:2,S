Right, but who stops some unrelated interrupt handler from completely
depleting memory?
What I'm saying is that there should be some coupling between the
reclaim context and the irq context doing work on its behalf.
For instance, you know how many pages are in the queue, and which queue.
So you could preallocate enough memory to handle that many pages from
irq context and couple that reserve to the queue object. Then irq
context can use that memory to do the work.
