My problem is that I don't know where the memory came from.  It could have been allocated 
via kmalloc, or vmalloc, or anywhere else.  Can I call vmalloc_to_page() on memory 
allocated via kmalloc()?  If the answer is no, then how can I tell whether the memory was 
allocated via vmalloc() or some other method?  I need a reliable virtual-to-physical (or 
virtual-to-bus, which is the same thing on x86 architectures) method for any memory address.
