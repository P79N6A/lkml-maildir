No idea - always try running without proprietary modules to check that it
is indeed a stock kernel problem.  I suspect it will be in this case, but
please check anyway.
Also, you may like to consider reporting the problem (without VMware
loaded) to the linux-pcmcia list at lists.infradead.org, where the guys
who developed this probing code hang out.
