CONFIG_SMP is part of the configuration system.

On a clean pre-patch-2.3.40-1 tree:
hafnium:~/src/pre-patch-2.3.40-1/include$ grep -r CONFIG_SMP *
asm-i386/bugs.h:#if defined(CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
asm-sparc/asm_offsets.h:#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
asm-sparc/asm_offsets.h:#else /* CONFIG_SMP */
asm-sparc/asm_offsets.h:#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
asm-sparc64/asm_offsets.h:#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
asm-sparc64/asm_offsets.h:#else /* CONFIG_SMP */
asm-sparc64/asm_offsets.h:#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
It seems that both i386, sparc and sparc64 already use CONFIG_SMP. The
main reason for my change is that I'd like to have only one symbol for SMP
throughout the kernel. That will make sure that no bugs appear because
one symbol is defined, but not the other as the case can be in the present
situation.
