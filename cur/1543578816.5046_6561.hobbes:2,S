Er,... forgive me if I'm being overly dense here, but I can't see anything 
fundamentally wrong in the above that wouldn't be fixed with a 
judicious application of s/module_//
But I have no particular attachment to it. All I'm asking for is a way to
avoid having init order dependencies where previously there was no need
for them, by having a way to put entries in the inter_module_get() table
at compile time.
