mount the nfs volumes with -o rsize=8192,wsize=8192. The default is 1024,
but 8192 is much much faster. You should be able to beat samba. Also look
into getting the updated knfsd, and apply the kernel patches. Esp if you
need locking to work, eg reading mail across nfs is unsafe without the
patches.
