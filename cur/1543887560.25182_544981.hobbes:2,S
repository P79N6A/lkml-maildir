shrink_dcache_memory->...sysfs_d_iput->BUG
                BUG_ON(sd->s_dentry != dentry);
a number of people have hit that, on and off.
We were close to having a fix, I think, but then we decided that great
chunks of sysfs needed rewriting and I believe that we believe that this
great rewrite will fix this bug.
But alas, it's all too late for 2.6.22.
How frequently do you see these failures?  If it's repeatable with any reliability
then it'd be great if you could test a patchset for us.  It's at:
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/cs.gz
that's a single patch against 2.6.21-rc1, containing the following patches, which 
are from the forthcoming 2.6.21-rc1-mm1 lineup:
