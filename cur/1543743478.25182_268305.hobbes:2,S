No, Roland is right, just use the class_device pointer you get back from
the core when a tty device is created.
Right now we aren't saving the pointer anywhere (see
tty_register_device() for where it is created.)  Just add that to the
proper tty_device structure, and you should be fine (yeah, it's going to
be a pain, and you will quickly see why I didn't do that in the first
place, but it is going to need to be changed eventually...)
Good luck,
