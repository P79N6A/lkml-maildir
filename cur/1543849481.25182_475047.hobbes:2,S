So does Linux now only support GLIBC apps? That's what your
grep seems to imply. At least one of the free Pascal compilers
does not use GLIBC. You won't find a GLIBC sysctl symbol in
any of the alternate C libraries (there are many) or even in libc5.
Running your grep on developer machines is highly biased
against legacy business apps.
Despite the desires of some fanatics, Linux does support an ABI
which is used by closed-source apps. Sometimes people even
lose their source code, perhaps via corporate reorganization.
I don't expect you plan to help anybody whose business depends
on some crufty old software...?
We have lots worse cruft if you want to go on a cleaning rampage.
We have old syscalls that can't handle modern data types.
