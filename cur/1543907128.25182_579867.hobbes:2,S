No stuck keys and no warping mouse seen yet since last time (currently running
2.6.23-rc2), so both problems are, for all practical purposes, fixed.

I don't think it's fair to blame Xorg for that, except if changing back to an older
version fixes it. If Thunderbird is anything comparable to Firefox, then it's most
likely the generic slowdown of that program that might have made it worse. If it's
Xorg then it's probably something driver/settings related I guess, best to ask on
their mailinglist for that.
Anyway, if you want to experience a shock, try enabling xcomposite and run
xcompmgr -a or something. It's so wonderfully smooth (even though some
rendering seems slower than before, it's really worth it for me).
Greetings,
Indan
