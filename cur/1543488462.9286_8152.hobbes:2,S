My #0.02 worth - I agree with Mark's finding in the Single UNIX v2 spec.
It seems logical and reasonable. In fact, I think essentially, that was
what Mark suggested in our chat here even before he checked the specs,
(which suggests that specs *are* written by human beings with some common
sense :) ).
I did not have time to try it under 2.2.2 as Ingo suggested - will try it
this evening probably. Also, Pavel Machek is reporting that he sees no
problem under 2.2.2UP so the actual corruption is either something
non-trivial or fixed in 2.2.2.
