Hmm, 0x800 seems unused here (at least in /proc/ioports). But 
the pcnet_cs modules uses only 0x300-0x307 and 0x310-0x317, so I 
reduced (in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts) the range from 
"include port 0x100-0x4ff, port 0x1000-0x17ff" to 
"include port 0x300-0x320, port 0x1000-0x17ff" and it seems to work 
now - at least the laptop booted sucessfully and and there is a 
network conection.
Thanks for your help!
