The core library (supporting the PCI chip and all devices attached
thru its i2c) is binary only.
The connection between the usual linux module api and this library
comes as source code for but is not GPL (NVIDIA driver like).
Unfortunately I personnally do not decide of this: many engineers work
at Sigma, with various backgrounds.
