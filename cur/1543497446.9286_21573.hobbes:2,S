Subject: [PATCH] Bogomips to 3 decimal places

Hi there.
The enclosed patch against kernel 2.2.9 increases the precision of the
BogoMIPS calculation sufficiently to allow the result to be printed to
three decimal places rather than the current 2 decimal places.
I developed it simply because I prefer to see suchlike figures to 3dp
and I'm not worried whether it ever makes its way into the official
kernel, but it's here anyway.
Best wishes from Riley.
