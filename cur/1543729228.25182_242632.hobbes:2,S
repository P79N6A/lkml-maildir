Hi All,
Is there a serial PPP Driver , that is capable of operating in half duplex 
mode. I have a radio that operates in half duplex mode and it has a serial 
interface. I want to establish a Point to Point connection between two 
Radios.
Do you have a serial port PPP Driver that supports half-duplex mode of 
operation ?. i.e.  I need RTS to be active when you are transmitting data 
and to be inactive to receive.
Thanks
Vanitha
