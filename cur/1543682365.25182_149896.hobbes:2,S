Nonsense.  Go look at the set of code actually funded by the FSF and it
is tiny.  The FSF tries to get everyone to sign over their copyright to
the FSF so they can "protect" the code and then they rename it to GNU
this that or the other thing.  Start reading those copyrights you are
talking about, of the set of things described as GNU something, I would
guess than less than 1% of it was paid for by the FSF.  The rest of it
is all stuff they slapped their name on after convincing people to sign
over copyrights.
