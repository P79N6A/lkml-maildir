Unfortunately we're also dealing (in many cases) with pre-existing 
software coming over from other OS's.  The beancounters want to avoid 
rewriting the millions of lines of application code, so they'd rather 
add the missing support to the kernel.
If it doesn't go into mainline, we'll just end up with a bunch of 
different telco-patches being maintained on the side.  I highly doubt 
all the applications will get fixed any time soon.
