Hmmm.  So you have several clients all mounting the same root
filesystem, and mounting it writable?  That doesn't sound like a plan
for success.  How do you make sure the clients don't tread over each
other when using /etc files?
I suspect that what you really want is to mount root read-only, or
mount separate roots for each client, and then in either case to mount
with the "nolock" flag.
I suspect that your problem is related to the client trying to do
locking, but no having statd running on the client.
You cannot meaningfully do locking on an NFS mounted root filesystem.
Infact, I think it would be good if the default mount options for nfs
root included nolock... and if I read fs/nfs/nfsroot.c:root_nfs_name
correctly, nolock is the default.  Are you overriding that default
be explicitly setting "lock"??
