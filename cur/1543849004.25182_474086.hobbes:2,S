I don't know if you want customers do know what domains they have. I think
you should avoid having explicit control over sched-domains in your cpusets
completely, and just have the cpusets create partitioned domains whenever
it can.

cpusets is the only thing that messes with sched-domains (excluding the
isolcpus -- that seems to require a small change to partition_sched_domains,
but forget that for now).
And so you should know what partitioning to build at any point when asked.
So we could have a call to cpusets at the end of arch_init_sched_domains,
which asks for the domains to be partitioned, no?
