    The Intel TSS stuff is *extremely* *slow* compared to doing it
    with discrete instructions, especially since many of the major
    supervisory registers do not change. 
    There are a number of intel instructions which were designed to
    run fast on a 486, which turn out to be dogs on higher-end cpu's.
    For example, the ENTER instruction is considerably slower then
    doing the frame pointer / stack pointer manipulation manually.
    There are many others.
