No.  He's doing a pivot_root to a new root filesystem.  You have
to do the 'exec chroot . /sbin/init ...' command given in the file
Documentation/initrd.txt in order for init to start up correctly.
Having played with pivoting to a ramfs out of an initrd for the
last several days, I can think of a couple of possible problems.
The first is that Amit's final linuxrc command:
>exec sbin/chroot . sbin/init.new 3 <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1
is different from what's described in initrd.txt.  I'm using the
exact line that's in there in my linuxrc, and it works fine.
Amit, try changing that line to:
exec chroot . /sbin/init.new 3 <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1
and see if that works.  This does require having chroot in your
initrd, but that is mentioned in initrd.txt as a requirement
anyways.  If init.new is the wrapper that I think was mentioned
here previously, I'd suggest just trying a regular init and doing
the umount and free of the ramdisk later somewhere in your
rc.sysinit or equivalent.
The second potential problem I can think of would be a missing
dev/console node in the new root filesystem.  I think I experienced
a similar failure mode once last Friday; it may have been the time
I forgot to mount devfs on /dev in my new root filesystem.
