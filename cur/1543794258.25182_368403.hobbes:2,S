I just did a 'google' to see if anybody had such a function.
It looks like he's going to have to write his own because there
isn't anything like that yet.
I don't know what you'd use it for because it's easy to
make two or more...
 	fputs(buffer, file1);
 	fputs(buffer, file2);
 	fputs(buffer, file3);
...etc.
Also, if he's using terminal I/O scripts, he should investigate
`tee`.
Maybe he thinks that stuff would get written simultaneously if
there were any such function!
Arijit, computers can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
Nothing gets written simultaneously! Just chose the order at
which you would like to have buffered I/O occur and, except
for 'stderr' even that order isn't guaranteed!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
