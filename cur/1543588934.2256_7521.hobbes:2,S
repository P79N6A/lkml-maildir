Oops, I saw "trident" and thought video.  Sorry, marcus.  :)
This is what I was told (it was only needed for secondary video
devices).  From that, I would expect that all video devices would
need it, just in case they happened to be the second card.  Am I
missing some subtlety in some of the video driers/chipsets that
wouldn't allow them to be used as a second video device (therefore
not requiring pci_enable_device)?
