    Hi all :)
>/proc/meminfo after the first process kill:

    This leads to a suggestion... How about aligning the top
indication with the numbers below (or even better, putting them in
different lines ;)))
    Even with more than 99MB of RAM (quite usual these days), the top
line is misaligned and a little bit confusing.
    I can make the necessary patch if anyone is interested.
