<MrHorse>No sir, I didn't like it.</MrHorse>  That would not only be 
ugly to read, but it would add maintenance burden.  If the default 
changes from NULL to non-NULL, code has to be changed from doing nothing 
in the NULL case to calling generic_method1.  The one place that we miss 
is the one place that will crash Linus' box. :)
