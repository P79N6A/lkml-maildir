Hello all,
   Anyone wishing to re-audit the drivers/block and drivers/char for locking issues and submit their patches to me directly, feel free. I think if more people comb through the code than myself, patches I missed will be found (100 eyes are better than 2). Once I think I have all the neccessary patches, blessed by the current maintainers, then I'll submit the patches to Linus for a finally blessing for inclusion into 2.4.0. 
Regards,
Frank
