I'd like to increase the number of processes that can run
simultaneously, is NR_TASKS the only thing that I need to change or is
it more complicated that that ?
I also saw that the number of processes is limited to 2048 under i386
architecture. Where does this limit come from and is there a way to
exceed it ?
I'm new to kernel modifications so if my questions are answered
elsewhere don't hesitate to just tell me where I cand find the answers.
Thanks in advance.
