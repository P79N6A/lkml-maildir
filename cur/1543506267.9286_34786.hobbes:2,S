Unfortunately, this doesn't work so well for sites (such as SGI),
where the linux-kernel mailing list is gatewayed onto a newsgroup;
as the readers of the list won't be (and don't want to be) subscribed 
individually.
I think if this guy can be, um, prevented from doing this 
again, leaving the list open is probably the best solution at 
this time.
Another possible suggestion would be to create a system which 
serves as an open NNTP/NNRP host containing the linux-kernel
(and other linux) mailing list(s) as newsgroups that can be
accessed via any NNRP enabled newsreader, ultimately to replace
the infeed side of the mailing list (one could still arrange
for digests to be mailed out, if one desired).
