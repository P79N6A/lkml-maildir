Interesting.  I have a couple 14x 100GB IDE boxes scheduled to show
up next week.  If I can get a patch for a reasonably recent kernel, I
could do a few tests on a ~1.2 GB FS, and maybe on one a bit bigger.
Once 160GB drives start shipping, it should be possible to make a 2TB
software RAID5 box in a 4U case for around $7k.
Interesting question: does Linux have problems with large NFS imports?
