Although, there is at least one case (reiser3) where we know which data
structures the BKL is supposed to be protecting, because the code does
something like reiserfs_write_lock(foo_data_structure) which gets
define'd away to lock_kernel().  And apparently some of the best and
brightest on LKML have tried and failed to fix it, and even Hans says
"it's HARD, the fix is reiser4".
So, maybe some of the current uses should be tagged as WONTFIX.
