thanks for looking... Chuck Ebbert mentioned some recent libc futex fixes 
offlist that I'll look into.

when the syslogd hang happens, cron will fork off a new task and then the 
child hangs.  The same thing happens with ssh into the box (sshd forks and 
the child hangs).  The 609 cron scripts in the particular sysrq+t are the 
result of normal system activity over a period of time, all hanging after 
the fork.
