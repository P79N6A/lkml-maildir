Thanks, I got understood as I wrote in the previous reply.
BTW, could you tell me your intention about pam_cap.c is implemented
with pam_sm_authenticate() and pam_sm_setcred()?
I think it can be done with pam_sm_open_session(), and this approach
enables to reduce the iteration of reading /etc/security/capability.conf.
How do you think the idea?
