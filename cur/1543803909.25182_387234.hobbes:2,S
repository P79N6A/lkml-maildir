Ridiculous, we'll never get there! Just look at 2.6.16-rc1 -
oh, there was no shortlog posted?

You probably don't know the mailing list, but I think it does not accept 
mails beyond 40K (some guess), but for sure it does not let 100KB through.
The 2.6.16-rc1 shortlogs would still need to shrank by 1.3MB to get where 
you want. However, if you read the description of [PATCH]es, you are 
already there (which is, though, a combination of goes-in and stays-out).
