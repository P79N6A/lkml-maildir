Martin,
I had this battle a long time ago.
Every little bit of disk that is out there, regardless if they should be
orphaned sectors or not, people want access.  This includes having the
kernel do stupid things like seek beyond media.
Just leave it alone.
Once all devices are 48-bit capable, then the game is over.
"All 48-bit capable shall be LBA addressed".
Nobody can force CHS crap down the pipes and thus the game is over on the
stupid concept of XXX/16/63!  Until then do everyone a favor and listen
and learn from AEB, okay?
Regards,
Andre Hedrick
