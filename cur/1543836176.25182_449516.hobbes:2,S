I agree that ARCH_HAS_* (and HAVE_ARCH_*) are unreadable.  However, the
#define xyzzy	xyzzy
solution isn't much better IMO and it will be confuzing
to people in a few years.

I have about 10 patches ready, but I'm not terribly happy with them.
Using Kconfig symbols for some of them seems more appropriate to me,
i.e., moving the symbol definitions from "random" header files to
Kconfig files.  After all, these are just hidden config settings.
Would that be acceptable?
