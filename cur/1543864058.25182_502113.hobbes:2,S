If we continue this dialogue for long enough, we'll actually have a changlog.

Of course it would.  But how do you know it is "too expensive"?  We "scan
all the vmas mapping a page" as a matter of course in the page scanner -
millions of times a minute.  If that's "too expensive" then ouch.
That, plus if we have so many vmas mapping a page for this effect to
matter, then your change as proposed will be so inaccurate as to be
useless, no?
