Subject: PCMCIA and 3c575: 2.2.28 kernel hangs during boot

Hi all,
I just wanted to let people now what I encountered.
I didn't/don't have much time to investigate as I'm doing some other development
and therefore reverted back to 2.2.13.
When I bootup my laptop (NEC Versa LX) from powerup, everything works fine.
But it's when I reboot it (eigther from a WinNT session or a Linux session).
All goes well until the PCMCIA services are starting, then the systems hangs
and only responds to a powerdown.  After the powerdown everything seems
to work. I could do reboots when having no PCMICA cards inserted.
I didn't do much more digging after I lockated the source, as every reboot
also means an fsck of all my fs'
Cheers,
Serge
