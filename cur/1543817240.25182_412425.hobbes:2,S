Thanks again!

After playing some more w/ sched.c tunables, which really should be exported 
through procfs, I adjusted these to yield near hardRT performance on a 
400MHz PII.
	MIN_TIMESLICE=1
	DEF_TIMESLICE=1
	PRIO_BONUS_RATIO=15
	INTERACTIVE_DELTA=20
Could you try them on vanilla 2.6.16?
Thanks!
