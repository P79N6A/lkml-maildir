Yes there are a few problems with the match, plus it needs to be on the
processed line to avoid false matches in strings (however unlikely).  I
ended up with the following:
                if ($line =~ /\*\s*\)\s*k[czm]alloc\b/) {
                        WARN("unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see
http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
\n" . $herecurr);
                }
Which just fits on the line :).
Thanks for the patch.  Will be in 0.10 coming to an -mm near you soon.
