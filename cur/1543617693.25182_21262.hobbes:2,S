No. Could we please integrate this not with ACPI, but with the much more
limited "arch/i386/kernel/acpitable.c", which does NOT imply full ACPI,
only scanning the tables for information in static format (like the irq
routing stuff).
That we can/will/should always enable, and we should NOT EVER encourage
this kind of "per-BIOS" crud. That just becomes a total horror to maintain
in the long run.
Please?
