I agree, but you simply admit that the NFS client doesn't seem to know, 
when the server was restart. The simpliest thing i can imagine, is that 
the NFS server generates a random integer-value at start, and transmits 
it along with ESTALE. If the integer-value is different from the 
integer-value the server send while mounting the FS, than the kernel has 
to remount it transparently. This is a simple thing so that a client can 
safely determine, if the server has been restarted, or not, and it only 
adds 4 byte to some nfs-packets.

In my case, if the nfs directory is mounted to /mnt/nfs, i can't even do 
a simple "cd /mnt/nfs" without getting the "stale nfs handle" - even if 
i use a different shell. I always thought, that the "cd /mnt/nfs" should 
work, since the shell will aquire a new handle, but it doesn't work :-(
So i'm not really talking about restoring all file-handles. The 
filehandles that were still open while the server restarted may stay 
broken, but i'd like to be abled to open new ones at last.

This is a good thing to do in general, but i think this needs improvement.
