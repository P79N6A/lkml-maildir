->writepages gets (in wbc->sync_mode) enough information to tell
synchronization request like umount or sync from
balance_dirty_pages(). Yes, it looks like better solution,
->writepages(inode, WB_SYNC_ALL) should just synchronously commit all
transactions involving any of inode's pages.

Hmm, I just noted that for now we probably could simply use exported
fsync_bdev(s->s_bdev) in fsync_super(s) stead. How simple. Thank you for
the useful discussion. :-)
