I don't give a shit.

Man you're so full of shit, your eyes are brown. NOBODY cares about
select/poll or that the interfaces are going to be adopted by other
Unixes. This issue has already been solved by then YEARS ago.
What I want (and a ton of other users) is a SIMPLE and generic way to
receive events from _MULTIPLE_multiple sources. I don't care about
kernel-level portability, easiness or whatever, the linux kernel
developers are good at not knowing what their users want.

This is a stupid comparaison. By your logic we should also have /dev/stdin,
/dev/stdout and /dev/stderr.

Yet another stupid comparaison, /proc is a MESS! Almost as worse as
the registry. Linux now has three pieces of crap for
configuration/information: /proc, sysfs and sysctl. Nobody knows
exactly what should go into each one of those. Crap design at it's
best.

So why the HELL don't we have those yet? Why haven't you designed
epoll with those in mind? Why don't you back your claims with patches?
(I'm not a kernel developer.)

I don't care about threadlets in this context, I just want to wait for
EVENTS from MULTIPLE sources WITHOUT mixing signals and other crap.
Your arrogance is amusing, stop pushing narrow-minded beliefs down the
throats of all Linux users. Kqueue, event ports,
WaitForMultipleObjects, epoll with multiple sources. That's what users
want, not yet another syscall/whatever hack.

Yet another hack!! 64kiB of space just to push some user events
around. Great idea!

Who said I want yet another interface? I just fucking want to receive
events from MULTIPLE sources through epoll. With or without a fd! My
anger and frustration is that we can get past this SIMPLE need!

Easier for kernel developers, of cource. <sarcasm> Who cares? Fuck the
users. <sarcasm>
