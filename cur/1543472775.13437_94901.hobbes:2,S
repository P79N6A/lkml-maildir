Interesting.  Minix and Coherent were both that cheap and were both
much better than Linux for several years.  Solaris and SCO are both
that cheap now, and they have some technical advantages over Linux.
I think the success of Linux, and the *BSDs, is because of freedom,
not because of technical advantages.  The technical advantages that
they now have is due to their success and freedom.

dunno.  nothing that you have posted in response has anything to do
with the kernel.  If you think that this is important, I would suggest
you stop posting.
