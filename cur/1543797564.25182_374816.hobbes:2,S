Well, effectively this is the way we do it now... Of course one can 
establish drivers/spi/lib subdir... :)

Well, I've had an experience working with full duplex SPI controller. 
I'm afraid that if you're gonna support it some time in the future, 
you'll have to rework the  message interface, won't you?

We can allocate a pool of messages at the very init stage and use our 
own technique to grab the next one from the pool in spimsg_alloc.
So we're not requiring _standard_ dynamic allocation model.
