Yes, it should.  However, I remember chasing down a similar bug in the
SpeedStep code back around 2.5.73-75 timeframe (which managed to manifest as
the audio chipset latching onto the wrong clocking, no less - it wasn't till
later that I noticed that the frequency and bogomips numbers in /proc/cpuinfo
were bogus too).  I admit never checking if either the original code or the
patch were backported to 2.4.

(the final actual fix ended up being slightly different, but that was the bug).
Feel free to hit "delete" if this is irrelevant...
