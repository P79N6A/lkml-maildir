My point was that you could just leave it blocked waiting for the I/O.
If you type fg before the I/O completes then the process will just
execute and return as if nothing had happened when the I/O finally
completes. If the I/O completes first then the processes winds its way
back to the return from the system call, notices that it is stopped and
blocks itself there. When the SIGCONT arrives, the process unblocks and
returns from the system call normally.
This is far better (less code, less complexity) than unblocking the I/O
(which may have partial results) getting the process to block somewhere
else and then trying to work out what on earth the right thing to do is
when SIGCONT arrives.
Simon.
