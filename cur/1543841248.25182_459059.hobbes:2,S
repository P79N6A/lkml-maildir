Sounds like a job for RCU (if locusts never sleep in critical sections)
or SRCU (if locusts do block).  ;-)  Seriously, this would get you
deterministic read-side acquisition overhead.  And very low overhead
at that -- no memory barriers, cache misses, or atomic instructions
in the common case of no mammoths/mastodons.
That said, I am not familiar enough with cpusets to know if there are
any gotchas in making the change appear atomic.  The usual approach
is to link updates in, so that readers either see the new state or
do not, but don't see any intermediate states.  I would guess that
updates sometimes involve moving resources from one set to another,
and that such moves must be atomic in the "mv" command sense.  There
are some reasonably straightforward ways of making this happen.
