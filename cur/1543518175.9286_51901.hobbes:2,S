Hi!
NFS locking does not seem to work with Linux clients and Solaris
server. The fcntl locking request returns ENOLCK and in the kernel log
the following lines are printed:
Dec  7 15:58:27 bcica kernel: nsm_mon_unmon: rpc failed, status=-13
Dec  7 15:58:27 bcica kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 164.48.158.2
Locking does work on Solaris clients, with the same server.
Should this work or not?
I don't know the version of the server, it's probably Solaris 2.6 or
2.7. The client is a Linux 2.2.13.
