Hi,
The Castlewood USB ORB drive is an external removable media drive
with a 2.2GB capacity.  It has a SCSI 50-pin High Density Narrow
connector.  The SCSI connector is attached to a special cable
(I'm not sure what distinguishes this cable from a standard
SCSI cable, but Castlewood says it isn't one) and then a secondary
cable is provided that apparently does some magic to convert
SCSI signals to USB Type A.  This second cable ends in a USB
connector.
The SCSI interface supports data transfer rates up to 12.2 MB/s
sustained rate and a 20MB/s burst rate.  The USB interface
supports up to 1 MB/s (I haven't determined what the average
transfer rate is for standard use).
