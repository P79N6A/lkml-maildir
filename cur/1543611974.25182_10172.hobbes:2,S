The advantage of having two structs means that both struct inode and the
private info can be aligned nicely.  Yes it potentially wastes a tiny
bit more memory, but I challenge you to find an architecture where doing
this isn't a win.  In a couple cases I looked at, additional slabs are
not even necessary, as kmalloc's standard ones do the job quite well. 
'cat /proc/slabinfo' for a list of the sizes.
Note this only applies to inodes.  There aren't enough superblocks in a
running system to worry about doing anything but simple kmalloc on the
superblock private info (before assigning to generic_sbp).
