Hi Willy,
Not as bad as I thought it might be!  :-)
The merge had the following conflicts:
	Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
		Conflicts with the ocfs2 tree - trivial to fix.
	arch/avr32/kernel/semaphore.c
		the avr32 tree appeared to just change spaces to tabs
		in this file so I removed it (as your changes did).
	include/linux/memory.h
		the driver-core changed the semaphore in here to a mutex,
		so the change from asm/semaphore.h to linux/semaphore.h
		is no longer needed.
