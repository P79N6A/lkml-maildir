Quite apart from this particular case, the general answer to such questions
should be Yes.
It must not be the case that Linux is roughly speaking POSIX-conforming
but deviates in a thousand obscure ways.
When a deviation is noticed, changing to be POSIX-conforming should
be the default action. Of course, some POSIX requirements are rather
unfortunate, and in individual cases there can be a good reason
not to change. Such individual cases should be discussed and well documented.
In a case like this, where it is clear that Linux is buggy, the bug
should just be fixed.  Of course it is your call to choose between
fixing a bug and keeping a stable interface.  If you choose the latter
this must be fixed in 2.7.
(By the way - 2.0.34 and 2.2.19 do not have this bug, 2.4.18 has.)
