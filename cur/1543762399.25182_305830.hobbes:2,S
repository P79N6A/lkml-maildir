I added similar support to the pre hw_random AMD8111 driver
a long time ago. Basically a timer that regularly read some
dat from the hw random generator and feed it into the random
code.
I think it is a good idea, because it doesnt make much sense
imho to run a daemon for something that can be done in 20 lines
of code in the kernel.
