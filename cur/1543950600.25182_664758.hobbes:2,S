It would probably make the whole paradigm a lot easier.  Currently, if
you look at the transport classes that do this type of thing, they
shadow host and add port and other components as extra bits.  libata
does a rather strange thing trying to have one SCSI host per SATA port,
so scsi_host and ata_host don't match up.  Then on destruction you can
just follow the standard SCSI teardown path.
