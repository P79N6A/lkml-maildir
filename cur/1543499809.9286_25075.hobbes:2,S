I'll second that...  I don't know what I saw with 2.2.5 (from RedHat 6.0),
but after 150 kernel compiles, the problem has not reoccurred.  I did not
change anything in my system configuration between when I saw the problem
and just recently when I couldn't reproduce it.
I do notice, however, that a lot of the people reporting problems are
using NCR810 based SCSI cards (like myself).
Mike.
