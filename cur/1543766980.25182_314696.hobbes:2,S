I dont see why we should keep a file in kernel tree without using it
(since the patch removes "source xfs/Kconfig). Anyway, here is another
patch that doesnt remove fs/xfs/Kconfig.
Also note that this patch (and the last one, too) moves "config
XFS_EXPOR" to the bottom, so the menu intems aligns better and
consistently with others (like what Reiserfs, JFS,... are doing)
Andrew, please pick one of these two. Thank you.
