This part, #2, can be easily fixed.

Sorry, NAK for now.  Unless other people agree that it is okay for them
to have an unconditional call to set_par() for every console switch. Note
that the set_par() in some drivers is terribly slow (several seconds at least).
Let's wait a few days, if nobody disagrees with you, so be it.
