But I care whether gcc barfs on code or not, and whether generated code
is correct or not.
I do very trivial 64bit computations in TV-Out portion of matroxfb,
but I spent two days shifting code up/down, adding temporary variables
and splitting expressions to simple ones to make code compilable at all
with gcc-2.95.4 compiling module for PIII kernel (Debian bug #151196). 
So I personally cannot recommend doing any 64bit math without setting
gcc-3.0 as minimal version for ia32 architecture.
