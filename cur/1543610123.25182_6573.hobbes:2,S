Hi
I hope I'm sending this to the right list, sorry if it's not :)
With compact flash cards connected via IDE what is the "normal" expected 
transfer rates?  I have a Sandisk (32 and 128MB) and I only get around 
2MB/sec (read test using hdparm) when all the docs from sandisk suggest 
around 16MB/sec.  They haven't returned my emails so I suspect their specs 
are a little misleading...they quote around 16MB/sec read transfer rates.
What sort of read rates should I be expecting?
Thanks
Paul
