It used to be customary at least on usenet to add "(sp?)" to a word you 
weren't certain about but it never worked for me. When I indicated I wanted 
to be acked/naked like that I really did but it was always just ignored. 
That in itself is enough indication of how deeply people care about spelling 
in technical content...
