This is my preference for the implementation of conversions to and from
what I call 'scsi endian'.
Personally, I am pondering creation and use of cpu_to_scsiXX() and
scsiXX_to_cpu() static inline helper functions in my code, because
I'm tired of hand-coding conversions for {read,write}{6,10,12,16}.
Further, the value I see in direct cdb-to-something conversions has
declined over time.  I now prefer the more clear
* scsi-to-u32
* u32-to-something
operations as preferred to a single
* scsi-to-something
operation that's hand-coded and frequently gets corner cases wrong.
