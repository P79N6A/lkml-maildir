lib-make-percpu_counter_add-take-s64.patch looks sensible, but it doesn't
actually work on 32-bit architectures: several users of percpu_counter_add
are passing -unsignedlong as the amount, which is not promoted to s64 in
the desired way, so "df" on extN filesystems is showing silly numbers.
The hack below (say long instead of s64 or s32) may be good as hotfix for
2.6.23-rc2-mm1, but is probably the worst of solutions.  Perhaps take-s64
should be reverted, perhaps there should be a percpu_counter_sub and the
filesystems use that instead of saying -unsignedlong, perhaps they should
use a cast or a long or an s64.  I don't know, but here's this for now...
