I think that this problem is related to the bug that the scsi-device 
moves from sda to sdb, sdc etc. when removing and inserting a memory
stick. I have applied a patch from Patrick Mansfield 
at 
 http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106580260717355&w=2
which solves both the changing of the scsi-device and the lilo-problem 
for 2.6-test7. 
It seems that this patch is already in the bk-tree so that you can 
use 2.6-test7-bk8 or wait for 2.6-test8.
Greetings,
Klaus Frahm.
