I don't think it would be that complicated.  We could just delay probing
for mmconfig until after the pci bus probes are done.  No changes to
other architectures needed.
I'm really disappointed with mmconfig.  Here was a great chance to get
rid of all the sucky performance problems of the past, and BIOS writers
and chipset designers have fucked up the implementation so much that
it's now the ugliest method for getting to pci config space.  And it's
the *only* method of getting to extended config space.
