Acutally it may be the next step.  Do you have pcmcia configured?  I've
been noticing that my system has been locking up on shutdown of the
pcmcia.
Ingo, here's the patch.  This should probably go upstream too since it can
happen there too.  The pccardd thread has a race in it that it can
shutdown in the TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state.  Here's the fix.
