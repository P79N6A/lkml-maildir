So don't use ext2fs for the initial RAM disk image :)) We use romfs in KSI
Linux instead for a very long time and we're quite happy with it. As a
matter of fact, we have all filesystems (including ext2fs) and all block
devises (including IDE) in modules. The only things built-in are initial RAM
disk and romfs...
One don't need a loopback device to create a romfs image...
