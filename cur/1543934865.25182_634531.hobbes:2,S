I know that, but as I wrote in the original message, the hangs occur
without it too.
I just tested it today. Had to leave it running
(in vesa framebuffer mode), without any nvidia modules.
Crash occurred after 4 hours of tv capturing, and didn't leave
any traces in dmesg logs (logged every second).
Unfortunately, I couldn't save any messages.
All I'm saying is that the problem is reproduceable without
nvidia module and without any X server running.
Thanks,
Alexander
