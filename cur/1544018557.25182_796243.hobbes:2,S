Hi Vivek,
Thanks for your comments.

The two responses are issues of IO scheduler based controllers, not
reasons why we implement the IO controller as a device mapper driver.
The reasons of that are:
- A user have a choice whether to use dm-ioband or not, and dm-ioband
  doesn't make any effects on the system if a user doesn't want to
  use it.
- The dm device is highly independent module, so we don't need to modify
  the existing kernel code including the IO schedulers. It can keep
  the IO scheduler implementation simple.
So, dm-ioband can co-exist with any other IO controllers from a
user's and kernel developer's perspective.

I don't think you are completely right.

Whether using dm-ioband or not, if the tasks of IO priority 7 do lot
of IO, then the device queue is going to be full and tasks which tries
to issue IOs are blocked until the queue get a slot. The IOs are
backlogged even if they are issued from the task of IO priority 0.
I don't understand why you think it's the biggest issue. The same
thing is going to happen without dm-ioband. 
If I were you, I create two cgroups and let tasks of lower priority
belong to one cgroup and tasks of higher priority belong to another,
and give higher bandwidth to the cgroup to which the higher priority
tasks belong. What do you think about this way?

Dm-ioband can work with the bio-cgroup mechanism, which makes task groups
in manner of the cgroup, of course.
I already have a basic design to make dm-ioband support the cgroup
hierarchy. This should be started after the core code of bio-cgroup,
which helps trace each I/O requests, is merged in -mm tree.
And the reason dm-ioband uses cgroup id to specify a cgroup is that
the current cgroup infrastructure lacks features to manage resources
placed in the kernel modules.

I don't think it's so pain. I think you are already using LVM devices on
your boxes. Setting up dm-ioband is the same as that for LVM. And some
scripts or something similar will help you set up them.
And it is also possible this algorithm can be directly implemented in the
block layer if this is really needed.

I'm sorry I missed your email with the question.
I already have a design plan for it and I will start to implement it
if there are a lot of requests for this. But I doubt this should be
implemented in kernel, which can be placed in user-land, such as
a daemon program.
