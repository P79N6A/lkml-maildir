While the PMBR 0xEE entry should cover the whole disk, I've got older
disks from Itanium1 Linux systems where it doesn't quite.  Likewise,
Windows systems appear to put 0xFFFFFFFF there, regardless of drive
size.  So that value can't be trusted.

Yes.
There are two ways to create software RAID volumes.
a) partition disks, put partitions in the array, then partition /dev/md_d0.
This is handled properly already.  The space projected to the OS as
the RAID volume does not include the underlying disks' partition table
sectors or last few sectors.  I tested this by making an md_d0 raid0
disk set, then partitioning that with GPT using parted, and all works
swimmingly, /dev/md_d0p[123456] all appeared as expected.  This is
the method that RAID autostart expects to find.
b) put whole disks in the array, then partition /dev/md_d0.
This isn't handled properly by existing code, because as you point
out, the MBR for the first disk and the MBR for the partitioned array
would occupy the same blocks.  In such a case, the GPT code would
blindly set up the disk with partitions (which were too big to have
fit on the disk), and then md would have done the same (with
partitions that fit in the md).  I've modified the GPT code to ignore
a partition table where the start or end blocks of the disk are
larger than the reported size of the disk.
There's a pathological case here, where you create a single-whole-disk
/dev/md_d0 device, then partition /dev/md_d0 into pieces.  I don't
know how to solve this, as the partition table data would occupy the
same space, and be valid for both configurations, but you would want
it to ignore the table on the disk and only care about the table on
the md.  I think this is just a case of "don't do that".
Patch to solve the immediate problem will follow in the next email.
Thanks,
