If somebody overrides the dnotify on the same file, he should become the
new owner, that's not handled in the below patch.
Secondly I prefer to return -EPERM to userspace if somebody tries to
drop a dnotify that it doesn't own, it gives more information back to
userspace.
On the same lines I would prefer that also a "turning_off" that fails to
find the file in the i_dnotify list , would return an error to be
strictier, but I didn't changed this bit of course.
