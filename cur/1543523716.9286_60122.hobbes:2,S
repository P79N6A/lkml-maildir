Shouldn't be a problem.  Anywhere that we stall in try_to_free_pages()
to wait for disk IO, we obviously have to set task->state to
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, as we're about to block.  If we do that as a
result of disk IO, then we have necessarily already scheduled a wakeup
event which will set the task state back to runnable.
So, the only risk is that the call to try_to_free_pages() has the
unexpected side effect of setting the task state to TASK_RUNNABLE.  That
isn't a problem: the only effect it will have on the caller is to make a
call schedule() return sooner than expected.
