I think that the kernel is a perfect target to optimize default -Os behavior for
(whereas template heavy C++ programs are a target to optimize -O2 for).
And I think we did a good job in listening to kernel developers if once in
time they tried to talk to us - GCC 4.3 should be good in compiling the
kernel with default -Os settings.  We, unfortunately, cannot retroactively
fix old versions that kernel developers happen to like and still use.
