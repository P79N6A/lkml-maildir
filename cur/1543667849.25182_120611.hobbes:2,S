           Summary: Framebuffer Console corrupted
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: mbligh@aracnet.com
         Submitter: smart@smartpal.de
Distribution: RedHat 8.0
Hardware Environment: Dell Latitude C640, Ati Radeon Mobility M7 LW
Software Environment: Kernel/Textconsole
Problem Description: options set to "yes": CONFIG_FB, CONFIG_FB_RADEON,
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE, CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_CLUT224 gives a corrupted
output, the guess that it's due to unmatching resolution between FB and
GraphicsCard is strengthened by the fact that switching into X for a short
moment shows two small textconsoles side by side (odd/pair line console
halves probably).
