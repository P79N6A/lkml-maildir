The problem isn't with the kernel but with your setup. For some
reason, the kernel is unable to contact the portmapper in order to
register a service.
That can mean either that you are starting rpc.portmap after you start
lockd, or that you have blocked access from 'localhost' (either using
the tcp_wrappers, or using ipchains).
