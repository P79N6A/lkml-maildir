I have been getting reports of -75 (babble?) and -110 errors with both 
control and iso transfers. The problematic kernels seem to be 2.4.17+, 
with uhci HCD. IIRC, nearly all of the reports mentioned a Via chipset. 
There are sporadic reports of corrupted iso packets (blocks of zeros 
inserted randomly) with uhci under 2.4.17 as well.
This is the first case of a usbfs-related ov511 error that I have seen. 
Very strange.
Greg (if you know): usbfs is not allowed to access claimed interfaces, 
correct? (ie. ones that are implicitly claimed because of a successful 
return from probe()). Are interfaces treated as claimed while probe() is 
active, so that user-space "probes" cannot interfere with driver probes()?
I use usb-uhci, uhci, and usb-ohci regularly with ov511, and I have 
never seen any of these problems. There are clearly a number of factors 
involved here.
