Hi!
I'm trying to run jffs on my ATA-flash disk (running ext2 could kill
some flash cells too soon, right?) but it refuses:
        if (MAJOR(dev) != MTD_BLOCK_MAJOR) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "JFFS: Trying to mount a "
                       "non-mtd device.\n");
                return 0;
        }
What are reasons for this check?
								Pavel
