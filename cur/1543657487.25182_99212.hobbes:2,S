The deal is that the 'CDCEther' (2.4) or 'cdc-ether' (2.5) driver
needs to blacklist the various devices using Lineo's "gadget side"
driver code, and it doesn't yet.  Presumably Brad would take a
patch for this.
The workaround I like best is adding it to /etc/hotplug/blacklist,
but I can imagine that not working for some folk (cable modems?).
