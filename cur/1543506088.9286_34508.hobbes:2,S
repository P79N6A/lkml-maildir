How does the kernel know that the device should be called /dev/sda1?
The kernel only knows that it was 08:01. The kernel doesn't know,
doesn't need to know, and cannot know, the names of the device files.
You could easily 'mknod /dev/foo b 8 1'. Or even more easily 'rm
/dev/sda1'; that wouldn't stop the kernel from mounting 08:01 as its
root filesystem.
In order to output the name of the device file, you would have to have
a table compiled into the kernel.

So you would also need a table of descriptive driver names.
What next? Should the kernel spit out a tutorial on how to go about
compiling in SCSI support?
IMO, the kernel doesn't need to be any more verbose. It already
outputs sufficient information to diagnose the problem. Explanations
belong in the documentation, not in the kernel itself.
