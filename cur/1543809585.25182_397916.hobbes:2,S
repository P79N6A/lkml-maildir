But doesn't that depend on whether we use (pspace,pid) or vpids?  If
vpids, then init isn't really a problem, since from kernelspace
processes in a comtainer stil have a global pid and global parent, and
init knows them.  If (pspace,pid), then we need a fakeinit bc the real
init doesn't know about the processes in the container...

I think to satisfy openvz existing customers this must be a yes.  With
vpid the answer is simple.  With (pspace,pid), there are three anwers i've
heard, namely
	1. just use pspaceid, pid
	2. make pspaceid small and use (pspaceid << SOMEBITS | pid)
	3. use pid1/pid2/pid3 where pid1 is creator of pid and its
	pspace, etc...
But the openvz guys also don't want userspace tool changes, making (2)
the most likely option.  Any other ideas?
> - Should the pids in a pid space be visible from the outside?
Again, the openvz guys say yes.
I think it should be acceptable if a pidspace is visible in all it's
ancestor pidspaces.  I.e. if I create pspace2 and pspace3 from pid 234
in pspace1, then pspace2 doesn't need to be able to address pspace3
and vice versa.
Kirill, is that acceptable?

Yes.

TO everyone, I don't think so.

Yes.
This is to support using pidspaces for vservers, and creating
migrateable sub-pidspaces in each vserver.

To some extent, yes.

IMO that is crucial.

I think this is completely unnecessary so long as a process can enter a
pidspace.

It must be possible to retain the same pids, at least from inside the
container.
So this is irrelevant, as the openvz approach can just virtualize the
old pid, while (pspace, pid) will be able to create a new container and
use the old pid values, which are then guaranteed to not be in use.

But you have, haven't you?  Namely, how can openvz provide it's
customers with a global view of all processes without putting 5 years of
work into a new sysadmin interface?
