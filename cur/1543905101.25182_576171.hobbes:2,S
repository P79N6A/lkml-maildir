Ok, that's HZ=100 is likely the worst case, as it effectively multiples 
all the scheduler latencies by 10 (rather than by 4, which is what the 
default 250Hz does).
That said, I think most testing showed that the CFS scheduler tunables 
didn't have a huge amount of impact on how things felt, so that 
factor-of-ten might not even matter that much. The 3D game issues may well 
be totally elsewhere.
But it's certainly worth looking at.
