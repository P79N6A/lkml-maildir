Adrian claimed that it was gcc-4.1.0 and 4.1.1 only.  He proposed
banning them:

No, there are some people who regularly run sparse and fix stuff.  Pending
things here include:
y:/usr/src/25> grep sparse series 
input-ads7846c-sparse-lock-annotation.patch
hugetlb-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
lib-fix-sparse-shadowed-variable-warning.patch
lib-proportionsc-trivial-sparse-lock-annotation.patch
nvidia-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
viafb-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
pm3fb-fix-sparse-warning.patch
neofb-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
i810-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
intelfb-fix-sparse-warnings.patch
Which is a good way for it to be used.
