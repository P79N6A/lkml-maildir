I haven't used this device/module in a while - but I have a problem where
changing the channel would not work (from xawtv - others?) *sometimes* ..
And to get the channel to change I would have to hold down the "+" key to
make it fly past channels (which would not get changed) until finally it
started changing... A sort of wake-up call...
