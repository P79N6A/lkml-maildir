Hi
I'm actually facing a small difficulty, i have a box with a web server, and
all the users are in a database, the ftpd, pop3d, mailer.local and httpd
gets almost everything from it.
My problem is that none of these users actually exists in the /etc/passwd
file, which make it difficult to edquota with the username. does someone
have a clue of how i could get this working.
