"different" is a key word here. why should we copy most of ext3 code
into ext4?

nope, we re-use existing i_data w/o any changes. yes, we've made
inode a bit larger to cache last found extent. this improves
performance in some workloads noticable though.

would "#if CONFIG_EXT3_EXTENTS" be a good solution then?
thanks. Alex
