Subject: [PATCH] [MMC] Properly use the new multi block-write error handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/1/67

Use the new multi block-write error reporting flag and properly tell the
block layer how much data was transferred before the error.
