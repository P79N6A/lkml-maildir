Hi all,
I'm using the kernel 2.6.0-test6/7 and I've noticed this warning into 
/var/log/messages
Oct 17 18:15:16 localhost kernel:  dswload-0269: *** Error: Looking up 
[PBST] in namespace, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
Oct 17 18:15:16 localhost kernel:  psparse-0589 [293932] 
ps_parse_loop         : During name lookup/catalog, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
Oct 17 18:15:16 localhost kernel:  psparse-1121: *** Error: Method 
execution failed [\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.BAT1._BST](Nodec12ab328),

when some programs concurrently access to /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/* files.
For example I use cpufrequency (a daemon to switch CPU frequency on my 
P4 laptop) 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpufrequency/
(this program checks every some seconds the status of battery)
and I use
        watch -n 8 "cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/*"
to see the battery state in a xterm.
Is there some lock to access to status of battery?
thanks for your time,
Paolo Dovera
