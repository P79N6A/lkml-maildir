This isn't the only case. Linux uses COW paging on fork. I.e. if an app
forks, it doesn't get a seperate copy of pages until it writes to them.
This is a termendous speed increase (no copies until needed, cache, etc) 
and quite a bit of memory savings, but you lose this memory saving if you
turn off overcommit.
