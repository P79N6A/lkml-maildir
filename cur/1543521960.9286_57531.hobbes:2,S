   As TyTso suggested the problem could be ato to be zero. I checked and I
   finally also spotted the offending bug that was causing the above
   condition to happen (second chunk of the patch):

		   timeout = max_timeout;
	   timeout += jiffies;
Note that max_timeout is always a small positive number (HZ/2 or HZ/10),
and timeout is a unsigned long.  Hence if the quickack bit is set,
timeout is > max_timeout, and so timeout gets capped to max_timeout.
Without the patch, we simply delay the hack by the max_timeout instead
of the current value of ato.  Probably not the best, but not a disaster,
either.

This fixes the bug, but I'd be much happier if we put a
belt-and-suspenders check in tcp_send_delayed_ack.  If there's some
other place which allows tcp_send_delayed_ack() to be called with
tp->ato set to zero, we shouldn't lock up the entire kernel.  
So I'd propose adding to the tcp_send_delayed_ack() something like this:
#define min_timeout HZ/50
	if (timeout < min_timeout)
		timeout = min_timeout;	/* This prevents an endless kernel loop */
(who me, paranoid?)
