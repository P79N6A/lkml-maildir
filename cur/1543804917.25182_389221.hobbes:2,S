Like this for example ?

This is a sata x86-64 raid1 system too.
With recent git kernels raid goes half-dead at boot, with FS corruption.
I think I also managed to have it OOM a few weeks ago (2.6.15 or
pre-2.6.15) which is quite a feat for a 2-GiB desktop (didn't report it at
the time, possible culprits where either ivtv of massive IO - I
shuffled/processed ~10 GiB of picture data from SATA CDs and then all
around the FS). The memory was unreclaimable, didn't know to check for
slab at the time. (also when I did use ivtv it generated some fat mpeg2
files)
The new corrupting problem is whith kernels without ivtv (I only build it
for kernels which boot fine)
All the kernels are un-tainted (only patches are davej ones and in one
case v4l+ivtv)
