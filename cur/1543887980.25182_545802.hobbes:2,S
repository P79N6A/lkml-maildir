Additional info: HID device has two collections (whatever those are, I
have _no_ idea):
collection 00: type: 1, usage: 000b0005, level: 00000000
collection 01: type: 2, usage: 0008003a, level: 00000001
The usage of the first one means 'Telephony/Headset', the second one
'LEDs/Usage Selected Indicator' (IDs taken from [1]).
The culprit is the IS_INPUT_APPLICATION() macro, which only accepts
certain 'usage' types. Should it also accept this particular one, too,
or even the whole 'Telephony' group? Or maybe add a (configurable)
'quirk' to enable the GameVoice device?
