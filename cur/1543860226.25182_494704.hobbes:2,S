Why don't you rip off the support for colliding inode number from the 
kernel at all (i.e. remove iget5_locked)?
It's reasonable to have either no support for colliding ino_t or full 
support for that (including syscalls that userspace can use to work with 
such filesystem) --- but I don't see any point in having half-way support 
in kernel as is right now.
As for syscall races --- if you pack something with tar and the directory 
changes underneath, you can't expect sane output anyway.
