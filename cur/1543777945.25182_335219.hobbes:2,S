The above are used by (at least) the PAS16 SCSI driver.  The PAS16 is
a 16-bit ISA soundcard that, in its "studio" incarnation, has a slow-
speed (intended for the CD-ROM drives of the time) SCSI interface based
on the NCR 5380.  As I recall, the Linux driver operated in polled mode
only: no interrupt handling capability.  That deficiency was never
corrected while I was a user of that card, and I quit using the card
somewhere in the 2.2 kernel version timeframe.
