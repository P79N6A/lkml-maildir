no, 478 usecs in _mmx_memcpy - the timer interrupt interrupted that
function and we returned to it after the timer irq. We only know that
the latency happens between try_to_wake_up()'s preempt_schedule() and
_mmax_memcpy. Latency tracing does not capture function exits (would be
too costly) so effects of two functions can add up. The try_to_wake_up()
was simply the last function _entry_ that happened in the timer irq,
that's why it got 'credited' for the latency.
do you still have the stacktrace too that went to the syslog? What
codepath called _mmx_memcpy()?
