BIG RED WARNING: Anybody thinking of using dynamic patching must
consider modules as well as the kernel.  modutils 2.4.8 added support
for ppc archdata to allow dynamic patching of modules using the ftr
data.  There also has to be code in kernel/module.c::module_arch_init()
to take the archdata and do whatever is required.
If anybody starts doing dynamic patching, please let me know so I can
handle modutils and module_arch_init().
