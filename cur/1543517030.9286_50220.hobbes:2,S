If this didn't work, you'd see data corruption and crashes on a
much larger scale.  I don't know the details of the bus signalling
protocol, but I'm pretty darn sure that only one processor is allowed
to own a cache-line in the M or E states at any one time.
When debugging this stuff, even 1-cycle windows tend to show up in 4-way
SMP stress-testing...  we even test multiple different SMP OSes.
We've got 8-way systems that happily run for weeks/months of uptime.
I myself ran a 4-way Linux SMP box with uptimes in the 5+ month
area.

I think you're confusing how MESI works.
First of all, for the LOCK to only go as far as the cache, then
the line must be in a either of the M or E states.  If it is in
an S state, it must get into one of the M or E states first.

I think they were referring to how hardware devices would see the
bus.  See following comments.

The WB memory type is very definitely the one you want to use.  It
is coherent, just not from the perspective of hardware devices
on the bus.  Using WT or UC would add complexity (since you have to
set it up), and simply lose you performance.

I'd guess the comment about "Weak Ordering" here is referring to how
hardware devices would see it (hence the comment on the fact that
reads can be done speculatively and writes can be bufferred and
combined...  if you only see the signals on the bus and don't disambiguate
what a cacheable image would look like, it would be Weak).
IA32 uses "Processor Ordering" (as I've surely bored the members
of this list by saying enough times in the last day or 2 ;) for WB memory
with respect to other processors.
For hardware devices, you have to use UC to make sure the actual bus
cycles are the right ones, since the very act of doing a read or
a write of a particular size, for example, might be recognized and
used by a particular device.
