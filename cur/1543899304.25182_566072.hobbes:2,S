After looking through sata_nv bug reports, I am leaning towards 
disabling ADMA by default, and wanted to solicit comments.
While admittedly not knowing the root cause, it seems like every current 
outstanding sata_nv bug report that remains after switching out hardware 
can be solved by setting module option 'adma' to zero.  That's my first 
suggestion upon any bugzilla sata_nv bug, and it usually works.  You can 
look through bugs assigned to or CC'd to jgarzik@pobox.com (kernel.org 
bugs) jgarzik@redhat.com (redhat.com bugs) for examples.
I still need to review the SWNCQ patch in detail, but I presume it is 
possible to still use SWNCQ without ADMA?
On a side note, I would rather default SWNCQ to 'on'.
