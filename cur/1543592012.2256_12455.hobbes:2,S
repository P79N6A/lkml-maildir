Note that the reason why xircom_cb for all cases is that it sets the
card into promisc mode, in all cases.  This punishes your CPU and laptop
battery on a loaded network.
Promisc mode is required because (AFAIK) Xircoms under the same PCI id
can use any one of three setup frame formats, and only one format is
known.
So, you are right, xircom_cb will help a lot in most cases, but the
hardware sucks.  I recommend avoiding it...

P.S. If anybody knows Xircom engineers, we would love a tech contact...
