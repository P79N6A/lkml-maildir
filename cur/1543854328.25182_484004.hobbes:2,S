Yes. I've told about DNS and IP, but forgot to show logs.
On time of writing first message, there was no DNS answer from root
servers about infradead; now i see ns0 on infradead.org request and ns0,
ns1, ns2 servers on canuck.infradead.org, ping is working, i can connect
to ports. Week or so ago there was "no route to host" problem. Because of
sending via smarthost and blocked outgoing 25 port, this all i can say.
