Gah, we don't want to do this by hand in either direction. It's the
inline nightmare all over again.
It'd be better to take a tool like oprofile and run it against some
test suite to generate a usage map, then re-sort based on the map.
Then ship a "standard" map in the stock tarball. Note that the map
need only list the popular functions.
The ideal sampling tool can collect second order information: which
functions are executed near each other as well as which are executed
most frequently.
