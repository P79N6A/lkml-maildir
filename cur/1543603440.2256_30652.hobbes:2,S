And while we're on the subject of architecture specific optimizations for
unaccelerated framebuffers (or framebuffers in general for that matter),
on SH4 you can remap the video memory area through a store queue and perform
all writes through the remapped store queue area (there are two store queues,
each are 32bytes, and are flushed to the memory they were mapped to on a
prefetch instruction). This allows for very high speed writes to external
memory, as it was designed for.
