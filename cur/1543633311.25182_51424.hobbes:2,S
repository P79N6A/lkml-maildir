would you be willing to accept a patch that enables per-socket accounting 
with a CONFIG_ option?
to my mind, i can see a number of perfectly valid scenarios.
one is for streaming-media applications which could use retransmissions as 
an indication to buffer more data and/or switch to a different bitrate.
another is for a http proxy which has multiple outgoing interfaces which 
are multihomed via different providers (and some via simplex satellite).
retransmissions woud be a nice metric to use for determining the weightings 
between using different interfaces.
cheers,
lincoln.
