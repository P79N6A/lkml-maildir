My impression was that a lot of negative discussion came out of some of the
user interface inventions in r4 (like sys_reiser4 and the
new incompatible EA interface). 
I guess a good strategy to get it going would be to extract just
a "core reiser4" out of it that is just a file system without
any new interfaces like this.
I would expect that reviewing that would be much smoother
because people could actually concentrate on the technical details.
