Not really.  Maybe it does have some uses, but I'm not aware of any.
But I don't think it would matter in the acceptance of the mount
hiding patch, since that patch was not rejected on the basis of what
FUSE would use it for, rather for the general philosophy of not
allowing namespace differences based on user id.

Yes.

Maybe.  You'd still have to convince me, that signals sent to suid
programs are not a security problem.
