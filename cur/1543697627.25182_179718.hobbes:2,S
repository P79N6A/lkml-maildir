Well, FWIW, I'm getting 100% reproducible Oopses on __boot__ by enabling
preemption AND (almost) all kernel-hacking CONFIG_DEBUG_* options - see my
post of 21.11.2003 with subject "[OOPS] 2.6.0-test7 + preempt + hacking".
If required, could try to narrow it down to 1 CONFIG option. However, the
Oops itself happens somewhere in NFS code (see backtrace in above email
for details).
