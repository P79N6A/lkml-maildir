If you can re-create it with pre-2, please give me a bit more information
about how to do so. pre-2 does fix a inode-related thing where we just
fail to notice that we have tons of inodes already for other uses, and
instead we allocate new ones, so the problem may be gone already. If not,
a short description of how to reproduce it, and I'll be on it like a fly
on a week-old dead donkey.
