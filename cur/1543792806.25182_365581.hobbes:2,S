This is quite hard to debug -- I do not even have serial console for
collie, and I know nothing about mtd.
Another issue is that collie is in pretty poor state -- it never
worked in mainline. Getting it working in mainline, even with
deprecated sharp.c driver, would bea big plus as I should get
users/testers at that point.
That said... I can certainly do few experiments. Switching map_name
from "sharp" to "cfi" should be theoretically enough to get new code
up?
