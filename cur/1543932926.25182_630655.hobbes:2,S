A lot more than X needs to be fixed to handle 64-bit BARs btw. There's a
whole load of places in drivers/pci/* where we just puke if we see a
value >4G being assigned.
Now, there is some hope that the new X with libpciaccess can cope with
that, and even if it is broken, it would be much easier to fix, as X in
that case is no longer trying to bypass the kernel, but instead uses
proper kernel interfaces to map device resources.
That used to be Xorg pci-rework branch, though it might have been merged
in the  trunk by now.
