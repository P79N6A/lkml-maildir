"worse" I can't tell, but at least not "better".

To the best of my knowledge everything else works as it is supposed
to, including all CDDA ripping done before any ordinary aduio-CD
playback, independently of the DMA setting.
NOTE: New observation: It seems to me now as if mounting of data CDs
also hangs after audio-CD playback. The "mount /mnt/cdrom" process is
sleeping uninterruptibly in "wait_on_buffer" as I write, and "kernel:
hdc: lost interrupt" is filling up my system log.
As far as I can understand that makes audio playback the "suspicious"
operation and not the ripping as I first assumed.
It surprises me that I've never encountered this error until recently.
I'm pretty new to ripping, so I thought that was the "offending"
operation. But I've used data and music CDs for almost two years
(since 2.0.32), and statistics suggest that I most certainly must have
mounted a data CD (successfully) after audio playback some time in the
past. Maybe I should unpack a 2.0.x and try...

Sounds really interesting. It'd be nice to get some hands-on
experience with kernel hacking (if that's what it takes). My holidays
just having started and all. :-)
Hope to hear from you.
