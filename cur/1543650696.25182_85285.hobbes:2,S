It's only nearly useless if you have some desire as an admin to
constantly be creating groups and changing group lists for users.  This
is not a feature which is useful only when serving files to Windows
machines, not even nearly.  AFS, Solaris, Irix etc have support for ACLs
and have a great deal of people who use them.  The simple yet common
situation of one user who wants to give even just read access to
another specific user for a given file is a pain in the ass to deal with
given the current structure.
