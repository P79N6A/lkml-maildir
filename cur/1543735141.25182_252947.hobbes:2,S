not that i disagree with the general idea and rationale, but reality is 
what it is today for some reasons:

. . . this ignore the realities of power restrictions of PCI today . . .
sure, one could create a PCI card that takes a power-connector, but that 
don't scale so well either . . .

TSO works on LAN-like environments (zero latency, minimal drop), it doesn't 
work so well across the internet . . .
i believe that there are better alternatives than TSO, but it involves NICs 
having decent scatter-gather DMA engines and being able to be handled 
multiple transactions (packets/frames) at once.
in theory, NICs like tg2/tg3 should be capable of implementing something 
like this -- if one could get to the ucode on the embedded cores.
at least with PCI Express the general architecture of a PC starts to have a 
hope of keeping up with Moore's law.
the same couldn't be said prior to DDR-SDRAM and higher front-side-bus 
frequencies.
cheers,
lincoln.
