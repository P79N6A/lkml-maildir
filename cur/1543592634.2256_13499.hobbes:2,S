I wondered if there were more cases.
In the (as-yet-unsent) Linus patch I've added an
	if (in_interrupt()) {
		shout_loudly();
		return;
	}
in three places to catch this possibility.   I'll prepare
a -ac diff.
This is a fundamental problem.
- The console is a tty device
- tty devices are callable from interrupts
- the console is very stateful and needs locking
- the locking must be interrupt-safe (irqsave)
- the console is very slow.
net result: we block interrupts for ages.  It's
an exceptional situation.  I hope Linus buys this
line of reasoning :)
