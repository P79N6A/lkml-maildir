Check your history...  tg3 was written by me and DaveM, and only after 
years was it picked up by the vendor as their official Linux driver. 
You have picked an excellent counter-example to your own argument.

Because nobody has hardware for them?

I seriously doubt you can come up with even a single concrete example here.
Regardless, libata has 55+ drivers and counting, all for the price of 
documentation and hardware.  Another quite strong counter example.

What experience?  AFAICS, pretty much all modern hardware in use outside 
of ATI/NVIDIA graphics is supported by Linux.
All visible evidence points to support for Greg's assertion.
