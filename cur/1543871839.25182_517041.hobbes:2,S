Different hypervisors have different time interfaces for good reasons -
mostly because the real hardware is such a mess, and there's no clear
"good" answer.  In other words, for the same reason that the new clock
infrastructure exists.
Xen, for example, uses the tsc as the principle timebase in the
hypervisor interface. A shared memory region is updated from time to
time with the tsc frequency and other parameters, and the guest is
expected to compute the current time in ns by extrapolating using the
current tsc value.  This only works because the hypervisor goes to some
effort to synchronize the tsc between the (real) cpus, but its otherwise
much the same as using the raw tsc.
Other hypervisors may take other approaches, depending on what the real
underlying hardware is and the real requirements.  One could imagine a
hypervisor exposing an hpet mapping, for example, or just having some
kind of completely synthetic time source.
The point is that if we were to build an abstraction layer over all of
these just so that we could have a single clocksource/event
implementation, it would be pretty much equivalent to the existing clock
infrastructure, and would add no value.
I was very pleased when I saw the clocksource/event mechanisms go into
the kernel because it means different hypervisors can have a clock*
implementation to match their own particular time model/interface
without having to clutter up the pv_ops interface, and still have a
well-defined interface to the rest of the kernel's time infrastructure.
I don't think having a clock implementation for each hypervisor is such
a big deal.  The Xen one, for example, is 300 lines of straightforward code.

The hypervisor may present abstracted time hardware, but there is real
time hardware under there somewhere, and there are benefits to making
the abstraction as thin as possible.  Xen chooses to express its time
interfaces in ns and so is a good direct match for the Linux time
infrastructure, but it still has to the 128-bit cycles<->ns conversion
*somewhere*, because the underlying hardware is still using cycles.  It
sounds like the VMWare folks have chosen to directly use cycles in order
to avoid that conversion altogether.

Yep, it worked out well.  The only warty thing in there is the asm
128-bit math needed in scale_delta() to convert tsc cycles to ns.  John
Stultz had suggested (on a much earlier incarnation of this code) that
it could be generally useful and could be hoisted to somewhere more
common.  I've included the whole thing below.
