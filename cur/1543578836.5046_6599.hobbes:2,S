It's the same with CFI command-set-specific code. Except that the 
command-set specific code didn't previously have to be initialised at all, 
and now we've got to initialise it (and have it call 
inter_module_register) before it's required by the cfi_probe code.
The difference here is that while drm_agp actually had to do some hardware
initialisation, the CFI command set handlers didn't - the only thing their
module_init routine does is call inter_module_register(). So we've
introduced the init order dependencies where previously they weren't
necessary.
That's the one flaw in the inter_module_get() stuff - we could do with a
way to put entries in the table at _compile_ time, rather than _only_ at
run time. 
While I accept that we can't eliminate init order dependencies completely,
I still think we should avoid them where it's possible. Which it would be
in this case, without much difficulty at all.
