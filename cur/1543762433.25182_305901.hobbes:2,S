Oh crap, so the compiler decided that agp_find_bridge() was a function and
decided to jump to it, rather than reading from it and doing an indirect
jump.  Yup, that'll crash it.  Sorry about that.
This is another reason why doing the old-style
	(*agp_find_bridge)(...);
is better than doing the new-style
	agp_find_bridge(...);
The former case won't even compile, and is more readable.
