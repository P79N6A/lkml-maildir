I just got a bunch of messages from vger.kernel.org, sent to
root@chaos.analogic.com, claiming a "local configuration error"
and some kind of a loop.
There is no configuration that has changed on that machine for
at least two years although our firewall got updated last week
to fix the ECN bug.
I checked with ns.uu.net to see if the machine address was still
resolvable, it is.
I can `telnet vger.kernel.org 25`. That connectivity works.
So I don't get any mail from vger.kernel.org.  What goes?
