Yes, and yes. But I think what he meant there is that we'd need to
audit the kernel for all users of set_bit and friends and see if callers
actually pass in any _data_ that _is_ volatile. So we have to kill them
there first, and then in the function declarations here. I think I'll put
that on my long-term todo list, but see below.

The compiler would start warning for all those cases (passing in
a pointer to volatile data, when the bitops have lost the volatile
casting from their function declarations), actually. Something like
"passing argument discards qualifiers from pointer type" ... but
considering I didn't see *any* of those warnings after these patches,
I'm confused as to what exactly Linus meant here ... and what exactly
do we need to do "kill the volatiles".

Yes, but see above.
