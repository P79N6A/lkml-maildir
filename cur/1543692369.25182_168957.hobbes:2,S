Just tried it again with 2.6.0-test6.  Same initial results, but the suid bit 
didn't clear directly after a sync, so that's probably just a coincidence.  
Can't say for sure that there isn't some other change though.  The only 
certain thing here is that your suid bit fix doesn't work, at least not with 
XFS.
