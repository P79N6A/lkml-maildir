Well, that's part of the contract by using an experimental version of HAL,
it has nothing to do with the kernel, as long as it's under
construction, you need to follow the latest releases. There is no
other way to do it, cause nobody can get complex software right in the
first place. So if that's a problem, don't depend on HAL until we
release a 1.0 version which will give you the needed stability. Just bug
the gentoo packager to catch up, cause there are more dependencies
anyway, not only a specific kernel version. And we don't fix any
bugs in any experimental version before 1.0, so please just help moving that
project faster forward by using the latest version, if you want to use
HAL.
