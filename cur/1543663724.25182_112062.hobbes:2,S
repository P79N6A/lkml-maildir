Hi Werner,
Thanks for putting together this list; I've been following this thread for
a while and it seems that the discussion always deteriorates into
semantics.  Anyway, I think there is an eighth possible solution to the
list you proposed.
Just to be specific, the requirements for the proc entry stuff are:
a) a mechanism needs to be defined to indicate that the entry is no longer
needed (something that starts the delete process -- ie, remove_proc_entry),
b) the code must conform to a system that ensures de->data will not be used
after the "release" code is executed, and
c) the "release" code must be eventually executed.
Assuming these requirements are really requirements (your options 1 and 4
don't seem to meet these) then an "eighth" solution is:
8) Have the unregister code (remove_proc_entry) set an external flag (eg,
   de->data_is_there), and update all users of de->data to check the flag
   before following the pointer.
Option 8 may not qualify as "sane", but I think it is important to add it
because it is what the module code is currently using.  Thus, one need not
look at the module stuff as a "special case", but as a general (if
complicated) resource management solution.
Finally, one could probably apply any of the "options" for any dynamically
allocated memory.  It is interesting that Linus seems to prefer option 2/7
(from the recent kobject work and CodingStyle).
If I've missed something, please let me know.
