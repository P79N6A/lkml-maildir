That reminds of of another thing that came up when looking over
the scsi bounce limit setting code.  All this bounce code ist based
purely on a scsi host and if existant it's struct device - imo
PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS should be a propert of each struct device because
a machine might have a iommu for one bus type but not another, e.g.
	dma_is_phys(dev);
For those arches that need it this could be expanded to per-bus
code, for all those where everything is either phys or not it
would be a simple define that ignores the argument and still produces
"perfect" code.
