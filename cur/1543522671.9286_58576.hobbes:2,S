[Personal cc's would be appreciated. I read this list via a web
 interface, as I collect my mail over a modem. I'm not sure of the
 latency of the web-page updates].
I help run a machine which hides a network in a shared house by
putting on a masquerade for an ISP which it dials up from time to
time. I'd like to see how many bytes are masqueraded to which
local-addresses during the course of a connection, to keep track of
what goes where and why.
As far as I can tell (RTFM,UTSL) (I'm using a 2.2.x) accounting is
only done as a global count of bytes/packets passing through a
particular chain. Now it's not practical for me to insist that there's
a separate forwarding chain for each local machine as we have, er, a
lot of machines passing through the house, these are allocated and
deallocated ip's in a process with all the refinement and managerial
control of a street battle.
What I'm asking then, is if it would be sensible for me to write a
patch which maintains records of what passes through the masquerading
process, and produces a summary of bytes/packets masqueraded to each
ip address, and made the results available in, say, /proc.
I can cope with doing that, but I'd be interested in
- The D'oh factor: Is there an easy way of doing this already?
- Vehement objections to the whole idea.
- Ideas, suggestions, and half-finished projects which might help.
Thanks for listening,
Dan.
