In order to be useful, I think you need to add a demand that the READDIR
call cannot loop back on itself for the case of a series of sequential
reads.
IOW: if a client attempts to step sequentially through the directory,
and is supplying valid filenames+cookies from the preceding READDIR
call, then the next READDIR call should be guaranteed never to loop back
to an earlier entry. Alternatively, if there is a danger that it might
due to some sudden and radical change in the directory layout, then it
should notify the client by returning something like a BAD_COOKIE error.
Otherwise, the client would have to cache _all_ previous READDIR results
since the last opendir()/rewinddir() in order to be able to do its own
loop detection and that will obviously never scale for large directories
or for directories that change frequently...
