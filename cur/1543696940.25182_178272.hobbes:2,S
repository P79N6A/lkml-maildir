Hi!
After having hacked up a patch to convert /proc/net/ip_conntrack
to seq_file (which was quite ah experience, I will comment on that in a
different mail), I am facing a different issue.
I haven't found a way to use seq_file for information that is not
exported as a global variable. 
Let's say I have some hash tables that are allocated during runtime of
the system, on users demand.  I have no way of knowing how many there
will be and how the user will want to call them.
For every of those hashtables I want to create a file in /proc and
export the data using seq_file().  Since the data objects are all the
same, I'd like to use the same seq_operations.{start,next,show,stop}
functions.  The whole struct seq_operations would be part of a larger
structure that already exists for every hash table.
However, how do I know which hashtable is to be read, when the
seq_operations.start() function is called?  I would somehow need a
pointer back to the hashtable from the file itself.  And please don't
tell me to call d_path() and find the correct hash table by the
filename.
The problem is, that seq_file is already using the file.private_data
member...
Any ideas?
Thanks for enlightening a networking hacker about the magic of the
virtual filesystem ;)
Please Cc' me in replies, that makes the job easier for my mail filters.
