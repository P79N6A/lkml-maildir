Subject: [PATCH] (4/4) discontigmem support for i386 against 2.5.30
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch provides generic discontiguous memory support for the i386
numa architecture.  The patch also provides supports for the ia32 IBM
NUMA-Q hardware platform.  John Stultz is working on adding support for 
the x440 hardware for the 2.5 tree.
This patch depends on the three patches that I just sent out (modularization 
of setup_arch(), modularization of mem_init(), and paddr -> pfn patches).
Assumptions made: 
        - that the first node has at least 900Mb of memory
Testing done: 
        - single proc desktop pc (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set)
        - 4 proc SMP system (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA is not set, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y)
        - 16 proc NUMA box with 4GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
        - 8 proc NUMA box with 8GB memeory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
	- 16 proc NUMA box with 16GB memory (CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ=y, 
		CONFIG_NUMA=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=64GB)
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
