setup_per_cpu_areas() is invoked quite early in the boot process and it
writes into the cpu_pda.data_offset field for all the cpus. I'd even tried
storing the offset table for cpus in a temporary table (which can be marked
__initdata and discarded later),  but there were references
to the static per cpu areas through per_cpu macros (which need to use the
cpu_pda) even before the BP boots up and starts the secondary cpus,
resulting in early exceptions.

Yes, I will change this and resubmit
