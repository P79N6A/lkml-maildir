Thank you, thank you, thank you. I was just thinking today how
annoying it is that whenever I boot up my laptop, dhclient runs and tries
to get an IP address on the ethernet interface until it's ^C'd. Since
I often use the Ethernet interface this is not a bad default, but dhclient
can't even realize on its own that there's no cable plugged in.
