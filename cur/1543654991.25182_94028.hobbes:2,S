I'm not entirely sure what you mean by `using the cache flush macros,'
but on one of my platforms, PCI consistent memory must be allocated from
a special area.
It's also not clear what you mean by `for cases like this' -- do you
mean, replace _all_ uses of xxx_alloc_consistent with kmalloc, or do you
mean just those cases where pci_alloc_consistent currently returns 0?
If the former, it obviously doesn't work on my platform; if the latter,
I guess this is what James' patch assumes the platform-specific
dma_alloc_consistent function will do.
