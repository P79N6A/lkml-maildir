I think we should increase the threshold beyond which the idle CPU
is woken up (more than the imbalance_pct that exists already). This
should justify waking up the CPU.

Maybe with a really smart watchdog solution, we can cut down this overhead.
I did think of other schemes - a dedicated CPU per node acting as watchdog 
for that node and per-node wacthdog kernel threads? - to name a few. What I had
proposed was the best I thought. But maybe we can look at improving it 
to see if the overhead concern you have can be reduced - meeting the interests
of both the worlds :)
