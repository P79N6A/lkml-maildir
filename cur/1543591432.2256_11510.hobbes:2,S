ok, pardon my ignorance if this has nothing to do with the kernel
proper, but it is something i find very neat on OpenBSD that I would
love to see implemented into linux...it is the change option to route.
Under Obsd I can simply route change ip gateway...i'd like to be able to
do the same if its something easy to implement...ideas? --gabe
