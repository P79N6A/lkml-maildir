That's the thing I would expect to see if you used 'noapic' and watchdog. 
I posted over the weekend that I have been seeing some inobvious results
to IPC benchmarking with scombinations of noapic and watchdog, but I
didn't snap the interrupts. I'll be happy to add that to my list of stuff
to try next weekend, but the box is not a toy during the week, and I would
have a five hour round trip drive if a reboot failed, so I'll pass on
trying it until I'll in the same room. 
What I posted may or may not be related, I was running 2.5.59 as stock as
I could and still compile.
