What the hell is /etc/modutils/devfsd? More Debian tricks?

Argh! Let me spell it out: I want you to collapse all devfsd
configuration files into a single file, and throw the stuff in
directories away. And I also want you to do the same for modutils
configuration files. I don't want you to edit out stuff that you think
isn't relevant. I want the whole bloody lot so I can see the context.
Once you've stripped down the configuration to something simple, check
if the Oops still happens. If so, decode it with ksymoops and send it.
Hm. And also send the complete output of dmesg. No editing.

Interesting. But I need those collapsed files. I have no desire to
figure out the subtle effects that can be generated by Debian's
configuration system.
