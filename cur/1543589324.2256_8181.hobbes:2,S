Yes, but we currently have more than 10K cycles for doing
memset of a page. If we do an syscall, we have around 600-900
(don't know exactly), which is still less.
The point is: The code in that "magic page" that considers the
tradeoff is KERNEL code, which is designed to care about such
trade-offs for that machine. Glibc never knows this stuff and
shouldn't, because it is already bloated.
We get the full win here, for our "compile the kernel for THIS
machine to get maximum performance"-strategy.
People tend to compile the kernel, but not the glibc.
Just let the benchmarks, Linus and Ulrich decide ;-)
