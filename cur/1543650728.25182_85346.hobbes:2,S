How do you deal with netdump when your network driver is what caused the 
crash?
Ideally I would like to see a dump framework that can have a number of 
possible dump targets.  We should be able to dump to any combination of 
network, serial, disk, flash, unused ram that isn't wiped over restarts, 
etc...
