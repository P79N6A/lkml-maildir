Subject: [PATCH]Call frame debug info for 2.6 kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds call frame debug record generation for entry.S frames.  If used 
with KGDB and gdb 6.0 it allows correct "back trace" (bt) through interrupt, 
system call and trap frames.  Frames that point to user space are tied off, 
those that point to the kernel unwind to the kernel.  It also ties off the 
initial frame in head.S and the idle process stacks for cpus other than cpu0 
(which actually goes back to head.S).  The patch adds one (1) instruction to the 
executable kernel (a few lines to the debug space, however).
The patch requires a gdb that handles CFI expressions, although it takes pains 
to work around a bug in gdb 6.0's expression analizer (the work around is also 
compatable with a correctly working expression analizer as can be found in the 
CVS version of gdb).  AFAIK gdb 6.0 is the first gdb to handle CFI expressions 
so you must use it to make this patch useful.
Use of earlier gdb's with this patch will not be affected (either for good or bad).
