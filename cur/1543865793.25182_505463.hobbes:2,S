How much investigation have the Oracle folks (besides Zach :-) done
into Evgeniy's kevent interfaces and how much feedback have they given
to him.
I know it sounds like I'm being a pain in the ass, but it saddens
me that there is this whole large body of work implemented to solve
a problem, the maintainer keeps posting patch sets and the whole
discussions has gone silent.
I'd be quiet if there were some well formulated objections to his work
being posted, but people are posting nothing.  So either it's a
perfect API or people aren't giving it the attention and consideration
it deserves.
