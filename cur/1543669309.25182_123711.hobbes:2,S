Eek, I have some opinions on this too.
I don't like the #define DEBUG approach.  It's useless for users; it's a
developer debug tool.  It won't allow some support staff to ask users to
enable module debugging (or subsystem debugging) and see what gets printed.
Martin, you are ahead of my schedule, but I was planning to use sysfs
to add a 'debug' flag/file that could be dynamically altered on a per-module
basis.
