Why would it be awkward? libgcc has the same problem, so they added this 
paragraph:
In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
Free Software Foundation gives you unlimited permission to link the
compiled version of this file into combinations with other programs,
and to distribute those combinations without any restriction coming
from the use of this file.  (The General Public License restrictions
do apply in other respects; for example, they cover modification of
the file, and distribution when not linked into a combine
executable.)
Why can't we do something similiar?

If it becomes part of the kernel (and a core part, not just some driver), 
it would be awkward to have a completely different license, so this should 
not be done without a very good reason.
