You should still attempt to post it as inline email for better review.
The hard limit on mails is 100kb right now, IIRC, so it should be
possible to split it up into smaller chunks for review.

Two things I noticed on a very brief review:
- The driver is _huge_. Even if your hardware is terribly complicated,
  the fact that you need 600kb to drive it is a hint that you do
  something wrong. In particular, the header files contain hundreds
  of macros that are completely unused. You should get rid of them.
- You define a driver specific multiplexing ioctl method. This is
  something you really shouldn't do in a network driver, since the
  ioctl number will conflict with other drivers. In order to get
  the rest of your code merged, I'd suggest you split out the
  private ioctl handling into a separate patch that you don't submit
  for now, and then we can think of how to replace the interfaces
  with something better, e.g. new driver-independent calls like ioctl
  or ethtool or sysfs, or get rid of them if they turn out to be
  not required.
