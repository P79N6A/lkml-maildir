Thanks, Alan for your reply to this,...just a couple clarifications
needed...

OK--"it should" fix the bug--my question is, how far has the
serverworks.c which was in the 2.4.6-ac series now propagated
into Linus' tree (and eventually into the RedHat tree?)  Also,
are the later 2.4.7 and higher -ac patches significantly
different from that which was found in the 2.4.6-ac patches?

Too bad we didn't know this a month ago... we had 136 of these machines
and were seeing it all the time, could have given you a perfect test
bed...we found the quickest way
to reproduce it was just to do ls -R /usr | grep Input/output error
and managed to make 80 of the 136 machines misbehave within a couple
of days time.  As a result of that the vendor swapped all the drives
to western digital and left us with a bug that has only happened on
10 machines over the course of 2 months--where the DMA timeouts
will hang the machine but not corrupt the data.

Just tell me what you think your latest and greatest patch is that
you would want to see tested and I'll be glad to give it a test on this
cluster.
Thanks
