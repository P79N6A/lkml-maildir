Even if it is in system memory there, accessing physical RAM using
ioremap() and asm/io.h accessors is not exactly legal.  On sparc64,
for example, accessing physical RAM as if it were I/O memory will
result in a BUS ERROR and in fact that's how the bootup crashes
on sparc64 due to this changeset.
Sparc64 systems do not reserve this area of physical ram for video
ROM, and in fact it is very common and possible to have a system
which there is not even physical RAM located at that physical address.
The amount of platforms-specific assumptions made by this code is
impressive, in fact :-)

I'm pretty sure it should use the PCI ROM bar area, just like it
always has until this change was installed.

This is what should happen, at the very least.
