Oh, well.. Journalling sucks.
I was actually _really_ hoping that somebody would come along and tell 
everybody that this whole journal-logging is stupid, and that it's just 
better to not ever re-write blocks on disk, but instead write to new 
blocks with version numbers (and not re-use old blocks until new versions 
are stable on disk).
There was even somebody who did something like that for a PhD thesis, I 
forget the details (and it apparently died when the thesis was presumably 
accepted ;).
