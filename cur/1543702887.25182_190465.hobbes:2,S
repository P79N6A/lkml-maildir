The example above is a direct map entry with no root offset.  The 
semantics are different than if it were an indirect map with browsing 
enable. 
I tested this out against other automount implementations and discovered 
that direct map entries with no root offsets should be broken down into 
several direct map entries with root offsets.. so:
/usr   /man1   server:/usr/man1   \
          /man2   server:/usr/man2
is the same as the two distinct entries:
/usr/man1   server:/usr/man1
/usr/man2   server:/usr/man2
Now that I think about it, the discussion in my proposal paper about 
multimounts with no root offsets probably isn't required.
