Subject: [patch] fix .text.exit error in drivers/net/r8169.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In drivers/net/r8169.c the function rtl8169_remove_one is __devexit but 
the pointer to it didn't use __devexit_p resulting in a.text.exit 
compile error when !CONFIG_HOTPLUG.
The fix is simple:
--- linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/net/r8169.c.old	2003-03-27 22:17:09.000000000 +0100

The patch applies against 2.4.21-pre6 and 2.5.66. I've tested the 
compilation with 2.4.21-pre6.
