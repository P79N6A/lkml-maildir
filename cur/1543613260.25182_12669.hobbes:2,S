Subject: passing params to boot readonly

I'm in a bit of a pickle and need to find a way to pass boot params to a 
reiserfs rootfs to *prevent* it from replaying the journal on single-user 
boot. This may seem like a strange request, but I've got a degraded RAID array 
that I need to poke around in before deciding whether or not to send a disk 
off to a rehab lab. If the replay occurs, it will potentially destroy the fs 
since I'm using a degraded snapshot of the failed disk in hopes of reclaiming 
*some* of my data. The system is running 2.2.x (can't remember and can't find 
out w/out booting).
Do I have a snowball's chance of pulling this off?
thanks,
stewart
