When I originally added this code, the problem I was seeing was
the ide layer was doing 8 retires before it returned to ide-cd,
which then did 8 retries itself.  Thus processing a bad sector
caused no less than 64 reads of the bad sector, all of which
failed, and each of which took a fair amount of time, thereby
keeping user space stuck in D state for over 10 minutes on a
single syscall, which seemed rather bad form...
When I added this code, I was relying on the ide layer to
continue to do its ritualistic 8 retries, after which I assumed
that no further retries would be likely to help and there was no
reason for ide-cd to keep thrashing on the already proven to be
dead sector.  For my purposes, this helped considerably reduce
the amount of time stuck in D state while processing CDs with bad
sectors (such as trying to recover the data off my kid's
massively scratched up game CDs).
