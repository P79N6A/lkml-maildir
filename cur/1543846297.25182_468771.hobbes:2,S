The only downside I can think of for dropping pt_regs is that now it's harder
to just find the IRQ handler in a driver ... it's previously been all but
guaranteed that the _only_ use of that type is the IRQ logic.  The upsides
surely outweigh that.

gaak!  where did that come from?  I'll be surprised if removing
that causes any problem at all.
