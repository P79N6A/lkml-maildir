Something like this perhaps?
#define at_readl(port, off)	__raw_readl((port)->membase + (off))
#define at_writel(v, port, off)	__raw_writel(v, (port)->membase + (off))
#define UART_PUT_CR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_CR)
#define UART_PUT_MR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_MR)
#define UART_PUT_IER(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_IER)
#define UART_PUT_IDR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_IDR)
#define UART_PUT_CHAR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_THR)
#define UART_PUT_BRGR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_BRGR)
#define UART_PUT_RTOR(port, v)	at_writel(v, port, ATMEL_US_RTOR)
That said, I wonder if it may actually be nicer to just use
at_writel()/at_readl() throughout the driver...but that's for a later
cleanup.

I can do it in a separate patch.

Yes, the difference was wiped out after a few times back and forth. It
was visible (or...not actually visible, but you know how to detect
these things) in the first couple of e-mails.
