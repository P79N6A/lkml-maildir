This is FUD. To get serious in-depth information about the problems
associated with dm-crypt and loop-aes read,
http://clemens.endorphin.org/LinuxHDEncSettings
This document has been reviewed by a couple of noteworthy people, also
partially to counter the on-going FUD postings, Jari Ruusu has been
posting to LKML repeatedly.
James Morris: Can we please talk about the merge of my LRW patches soon?
The insecurity of CBC based encryption such as dm-crypt and loop-aes is
the reason why I have been pushing this patch so hard for the last two
months now.
