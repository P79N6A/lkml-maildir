Subject: [RFT 2.6] isoch.c: replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As pci_find_device is going away soon I have converted this file to use
pci_get_device instead. for_each_pci_dev is just a macro wrapper around
pci_get_device.  I have compile tested it. If anyone has this hardware
and could test it that would be great.
