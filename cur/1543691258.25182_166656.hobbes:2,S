Why are you (still) using 2.4.14-preX? Current stable version is 2.4.22 
and 2.4.23-preX is under development.
Anyway, grep for "unlock_page" in all .c files, find out if the .o of it 
is built and if the symbol is exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL.
BTW. Did you save the .config file and ran "make mrproper" before 
building? It is very likely that after patching up in a "used" tree, the 
rebuild is not going entirely correctly.
Regards,
Bas.
