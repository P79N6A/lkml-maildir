This seems to me to be a rather uninformed, arrogant, and quite stupid
comment.
Thank you, sir, for calling my comment stupid. Perhaps you are one of  
those FUSE folk. In that case, I would love for you to enlighten
me as to why any one would bother attempting to port a file system when it  
is known that not only is it much slower than the slowest
currently available to Linux, but also does not provide much of the  
functionality of the original product.
As to uninformed, well, yes, I am uninformed; hence my request for you to  
inform me. And arrogant? I sure am.
Cheers.
