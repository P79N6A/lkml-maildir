That's not entirely fair ... if you're switching over from a config
you've been dragging around for years which uses IDE rather than ATA,
it's far from obvious which config options you need to change.  I think
Andi's patch is a good one.  It might also be good to select SR (at
least my wife's laptop has the cd-rom on SATA).
