OK. So - trying to fill in the absent documentation, then:
When writing a block device driver, you can either make it handle clustered 
requests, or not.
If you don't want to make it handle clustered requests, then when you get a
request, you must:
 1. Transfer CURRENT->current_nr_sectors, in the appropriate direction
	to/from CURRENT->buffer
 2. Increase CURRENT->sector yourself by CURRENT->current_nr_sectors
 3. Call end_request(1)
If you _do_ want to handle clustered requests, then what are you supposed to 
do?

I can't speak for anyone else - but I think it would be a good idea. I 
certainly would have found it useful if there had been a correct template for 
me to use. My block device code was lifted directly from rd.c, and I therefore 
assume that rd.c doesn't correctly handle clustered requests, either.

If it's going to take much time to clean it up, you might find that it's more 
productive just to write some documentation :)
