Hello Greg,
just for understanding the problem right. Some questions.

How could users really say/complain what brakage they have, in fact they
don't even know the relationship between all that
( e.g drivers -> devfs -> sysfs or other programs that rely on devfs)?
They aren't all developers to encrypt the "magic" bug reports/debug messages
spreading over the screen.

Right, it's a good/right work to remove dispensable code from kernel.
Even it makes it easier to maintain the code but what happen if
there is an "for now" an unresolved/unknown problem which no one notice 
so far?
Devfs is in for many years, why removing it in just some weeks?

I think this is a bad solution because on the one hand you "force" to 
remove devfs due it's crappy
naming sheme and on the other hand offering to add such thing again 
which brakes ALSA and other. *confused*
Even if it has only 300 lines of code.
This is not consistent with the intention to remove devfs forever.
Either say "live with it or die" or leave it as it is.
