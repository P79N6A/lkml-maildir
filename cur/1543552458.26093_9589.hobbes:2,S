Subject: kernel.org downtime tomorrow

At some time tomorrow, probably around 21:00 UTC/12:00 PDT,
ftp/www/rsync/filehub.kernel.org will be taken down for a hardware
upgrade.  This downtime is expected to last for approximately 3 hours,
but it's going to be largely dependent on if we run into any snags or
not.
In the meantime, of course, the Linux Kernel Archives Mirror System will
still be available.
