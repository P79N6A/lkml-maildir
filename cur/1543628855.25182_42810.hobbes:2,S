So then we test for this condition (avoiding races, of course) and if
so, what?  We will have a timer interrupt prior to the slice end, and
will have to make this decision all over again.  However, the real rub
is that we have to keep track of elapsed time and account for that (i.e.
shorten the remaining slice) not only in the timer interrupt, but each
context switch.  We are still doing more work each schedule and making
it "smaller" just puts off the inevitable, i.e. at some level of
scheduling activity we will accumulate more time in this accounting code
than in the current "flat" or constant overhead way of doing things.
