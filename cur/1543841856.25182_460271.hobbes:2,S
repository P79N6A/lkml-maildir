because this union is used both for kernel memory accounting and user memeory tracking.

This is some arbitraty limited container, just to make sure it is not
created unlimited. User space should initialize limits properly after creation
anyway. So I don't see reasons to make it configurable, do you?

yep.

yes. my intention is to account correctly all needed information first.
After we agree on accounting, we can agree on how to do reclamaition.
