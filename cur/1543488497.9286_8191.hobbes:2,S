	It's silly to count all devices which have software accessable
serial number. No one of this can't be 100% reliable used to identify
your machine like PIII psn just because all of it not obligatory. You
can not using DDC monitor, or ethernet card, or IDE disk and so on.
So it's impossible to include such possibility to web browser, but
with PIII psn such possibilities became real. And I never buy PIII until
psn will be removed at all. I don't thrust Intel. I don't thrust that
once disabled this psn possibility can't be reenabled in some (may be
undocumented) way.
