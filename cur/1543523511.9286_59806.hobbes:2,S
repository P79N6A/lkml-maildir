I think I was unclear again.
I was not meaning that you should create a special benchmark.
I was meaning that you should run two passes for the benchmark you are
using.
pass 1. standard kernel (or standard kernel with re-ordering patch
applied)
pass 2 new scheduler (or new scheduler with re-ordering patch applied)
The new scheduler for pass 2 should not be the one that switched between
the two algorithms, it should be just the new algorithm.
After you can tell where the performance lines cross then you can do a
pass 3 that dynamicly switches between the two and see how much that
suffers compared to pass 1 (it _will_ suffer becouse you have to run the
test to see if you should switch to the new algorithm)`
personally I have my doubts as to the value of dynamicly changing from one
to the other, I think the value of the new scheduler will be on machines
with many CPUs where you _do_ legitamatly have longer run queues and there
you can compile it in becouse if you have a run queue shorter then the
number of CPUs that you have you have an idle CPU that can run the
scheduler with no loss
