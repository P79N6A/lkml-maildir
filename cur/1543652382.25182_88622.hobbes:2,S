I am experiencing some strange behaviour with Debian Woody. I have
attached a log as plain text and the output of dmesg.
I suspect it may be faulty RAM.
This occurs ONLY when I am in a KDE kdm managed X session and press
ctrl+alt+f[1-6] to get to a virtual console. It's not always consistent
but that's when it's most likely to happen.
X disappears from underneath me as well.
