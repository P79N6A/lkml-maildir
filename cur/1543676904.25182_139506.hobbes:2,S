Amusingly, we hit _exactly_ this same problem a couple of days ago
in Lustre because we were trying to use RW locks instead of the single
directory i_sem to improve large (10M files) directory lookup performance,
and it is hard to hit and even harder to detect.
We've gone back to using i_sem to protect the actual dentry instantiation
in lookup for now (we have a separate DLM for doing RW locking of the
directory for create/rename/unlink), but will be looking at ways to allow
this in the filesystem again at some time in the future.  Allowing RW
locking for local filesystem lookups would probably also be a win.
My 5-minute theory to fix this is to re-check the inode dentry alias list
when you are doing d_instantiate() (with dcache lock held) for another
dentry with the same hash (and further the same name if the hashes match),
but that would behave poorly when there are large numbers of links to a
single file.  It _might_ be safe to check the first N entries on the
i_dentry list, where N ~= num_cpus, assuming that we could only have N
racy dentry lookups going at one time.  Even so, the boost of allowing
multiple parallel lookups for huge directories probably beats out the
extra searching slowdown for the uncommon many-links-to-inode case.
Cheers, Andreas
