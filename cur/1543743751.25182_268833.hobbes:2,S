Subject: BUG at fs/inode.c:1100 in usermode linux 2.6.9 with hostfs as root.

Mounting hostfs as the root filesystem doesn't seem to work.  I compiled 
usermode linux (tar xvjf linux-2.6.9.tar.bz2; cd linux-2.6.9; make ARCH=um 
menuconfig; make ARCH=um).  Compiled in hostfs (I can send my config if it 
helps but I tried disabling just about everything while debugging and the 
problem didn't change.)
I ran the result with the following command line:
./vmlinux init=/bin/sh rootflags=/path/to/rootdir,rw rootfstype=hostfs
And it gave the error message in the title.
Before this, I tried following what Documention/uml says about using hostfs as 
a root device, but it doesn't work.  It's talking about ubd, not hostfs.  
(I've tried with ubd compiled in and without it compiled in, no difference.)  
It says unknown root device 98:0 and please use a root=option and never tries 
to mount a hostfs anything.
The above command line does make it mount hostfs.  I can stick in a printf and 
a sys_access() right after prepare_namespace() in init/main.c, and it can see 
the files in the directory.  But if I let the boot continue, it hits the 
BUG()...
Er... Help?
