Subject:	Kernel 2.4.11 & 2.4.12 are much slower
Hello,
	I try kernel 2.4.11 and 2.4.12 (RH 7.1, gcc-2.96-81, celeron 300 mhz
256 mb ram, ide ata 100 ibm)
	I compile kernel with 2.4.11 - 110 minutes (with any other 40 min)
KDE 2.2.1 is unresponsible and I back in 2.4.10
What is problem ?
regards
peco

I also noticed disk performance w/ 2.4.12. The kernel settings are exactly the same I used for 2.4.11 and 2.4.10.
Regards,
Rui
