For exact details: there's a magic value, but it's 3.
	open("file", 3)
will open the filename with neither read nor write permissions, but it
will actually _require_ both read- and write- permissions, and it was
historically a way to open a device just for ioctl's.
I don't think anybody actually uses it any more.
