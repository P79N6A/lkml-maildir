Ingo, there are other problems with the "map only a limited part of the
physical memory" approach: the SMP tables are in high memory on newer
systems from intel etc. Instead of this patch, I'd much rather get a patch
that moves "paging_init()" from init/main.c into setup_arch().
As far as I can see, moving paging_init() into setup_arch() (just before
"init_smp_config()"), should work, and should mean that we have access to
the whole physical address space earlier so that these workarounds
wouldn't be needed. Would you mind taking a look at that alternate
approach instead?
("paging_init()" is really an arch-specific thing anyway: many
architectures do not need any page table setup at all due to having a 1:1
hardware mapping for the kernel address space already, so this makes sense
from a bigger architectural standpoint too, I think).
