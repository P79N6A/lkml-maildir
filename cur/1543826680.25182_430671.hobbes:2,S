Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Add a prctl to change the endianness of a process.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/7/20

From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
This new prctl is intended for changing the execution mode of the
processor, on processors that support both a little-endian mode and a
big-endian mode.  It is intended for use by programs such as
instruction set emulators (for example an x86 emulator on PowerPC),
which may find it convenient to use the processor in an alternate
endianness mode when executing translated instructions.
Note that this does not imply the existence of a fully-fledged ABI for
both endiannesses, or of compatibility code for converting system
calls done in the non-native endianness mode.  The program is expected
to arrange for all of its system call arguments to be presented in the
native endianness.
Switching between big and little-endian mode will require some care in
constructing the instruction sequence for the switch.  Generally the
instructions up to the instruction that invokes the prctl system call
will have to be in the old endianness, and subsequent instructions
will have to be in the new endianness.

Andrew: if you are OK with this patch, I will put it in the
powerpc.git tree along with the next 2 patches in this series, and
merge them to Linus after 2.6.17 is released.
