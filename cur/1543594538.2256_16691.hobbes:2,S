It certainly can be used for other tasks.  At CERN we have programmed
both processors on the Tigon2 to act as a traffic generator &
measurement tool to test switches.  We use lots of cards in parallel to
drive all ports on a switch.  It's given us much more useful results
than the expensive S*******s tester.
We even went so far as to build a Tigon2 development kit for Linux, and
got about 5% better performance just from using a better version of GCC and
linker tricks.
The Tigon2 cards are wonderful because of our ability to program it
however we like, and I really hope we can build similar interesting devices
from a crop of someone's Tigon3 cards.
