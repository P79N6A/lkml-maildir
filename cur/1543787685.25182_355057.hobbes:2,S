binary data in sysfs is for stuff that is just a "pass through" for the
kernel.  Copying the pci config space, in raw form from the device to
userspace is one such example.  Firmware blobs is another one.
Binary data in sysfs is _not_ for exporting kernel structures or other
data that the kernel "understands" and manipulates.
Hope this helps,
