As you have 2K blocks, 252 is the largest number of sectors that can
fit into a request (MAX_SECTORS == 254).
So it looks like you are getting 128k synchronous IO requests, which
are being broken into one 126K request and one 2K request.
If these were READ requests, I would blame the read-ahead code.  It
currently always does synchronous read-ahead (I sent a patch to
linux-kernel a while back but it hasn't made it into test7.  I'll
resubmit to Linus.  But I assume that the 'W' means that these are
write requests. 
If you are writing out to the block device (cat > /dev/sdxx) then
you would get 128k synchronous requests:   block_dev.c(block_write)
collects 64 buffers together and writes them out syncronously.
With a 2k block size, that is 128k.
To test that this is the issue, you could change NBUF in block_dev.c
to 63.
Alternatively, you could create a filesystem on the device and write
to that.  You don't get synchronous writes then so you shouldn't get
the small requests nearly as
much.

I didn't expect it to, but thanks for checking.
