Subject: [PATCH 7/7] RT: push-rt enhancements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/11/305

There are three events that require consideration for redistributing RT tasks:
1) When one or more higher-priority tasks preempts a lower-one from a RQ
2) When a lower-priority task is woken up on a RQ
3) When a RQ downgrades its current priority
Steve Rostedt's push_rt patch addresses (1).  It hooks in right after a new
task has been switched-in.  If this was the result of an RT preemption, or if
more than one task was awoken at the same time, we can try to push some of
those other tasks away.
This patch addresses (2).  When we wake up a task, we check to see if it would
preempt the current task on the queue.  If it will not, we attempt to find a
better suited CPU (e.g. one running something lower priority than the task
being woken) and try to activate the task there.
Finally, we have (3).  In theory, we only need to balance_rt_tasks() if the
following conditions are met:
   1) One or more CPUs are in overload, AND
   2) We are about to switch to a task that lowers our priority.
(3) will be addressed in a later patch.
In addtion, this patch also enhances the behavior of the push_rt feature such
that it will try to drain as many tasks as it can until there are no more
tasks, or equilibrium is achieved.  The orignal logic only tried to push one
task per event.
