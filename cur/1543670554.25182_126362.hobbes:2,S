Hello,
Each time I try to shutdown my machine now running kernel 2.5.68,
I have messages stating :
unregister_netdevice: waiting for tap0 to become free. Usage count = 2
for ever, and the machine doesn't stop/halt/restart.
Trying to kill the process using tap0 is not enough, it seems to
be "unkillable"... (it is the tool named vtund).
What is this ? It is perfect with 2.4.x
Regards,
Paul
