Hi,
I'm experiencing skips in games like q3demo and enemy territory on a
dual xeon p4. That means, if I'm walking around, about every 2-3 seconds
I'm skipping a bit of the way. It seems that the clock is running too
slow and the games are trying to catch up every x seconds with the
system time.
System is running 2.6.0-test9-mm1. This effect does not show with
2.4.23pre6aa3, though there are only two processors displayed. Is this
normal? Judging from the temperature sensors that is not just one
processor with its sibling but really the two physical processors. Is
there any way with 2.4 to show all 4 processors?
I've tried booting 2.6 with nosmp, but that results in most interrupts
not working anymore.
What can I try to get test9 working properly?
Thanks,
Jan
