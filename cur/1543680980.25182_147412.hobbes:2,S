well of course 110% is more than what you have of resources and xine
would have to drop frames to keep it up... :)
anyway, if xine uses 10% of your CPU, that time is mostly likely spent
at the decoder thread. the only thread that i would set to use SOFTRR
would be the output thread, which does use very like CPU.
