64 bits as in NFS v4 is still not large enough to hold a filename.  For practical reasons, ReiserFS
does what is needed to work with NFS, but what is needed bad design features, and any FS designer
who doesn't feel the need to get along with NFS should not have acceptance of bad design be made a
criterion for the acceptance of his patches.  Just let NFS not work for Craig's FS, what is the
problem with that?
