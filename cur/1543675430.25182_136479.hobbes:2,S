   cachetlb.txt also says "_OR_ the kernel is about to read from a page cache 
   page..." and it's used like this in mm/filemap.c.
That's correct.
   I think it would be better to move this into a separate function,
How about just a flag, saying which event is occuring/about-to-occur?
Franks a lot,
