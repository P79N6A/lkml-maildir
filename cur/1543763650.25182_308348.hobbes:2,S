Once again I spoke too soon. I got the same lockup with 43-06, it just
took a little more to do so. All I did differently was to put the test
into a while loop on the command line:
while : ; do test3_rs ; done
On the second iteration, it locked up in the same place as 36-02. But
this is a different issue than what I showed with a NFS mounted system.
That was a BUG where as this has something in a spinning loop somewhere.
The attached is the gzipped minicom capture.  After the system locked
up, I was still able to get the serial input and do a few task dumps. I
did several and it clearly shows that the system is locked. What you
constantly see is:
R        test3_rt: 2263 [cbd6b9b0, 116] (not blocked)
S        test3_rt: 2264 [cc06d8d0,  89] (not blocked)
S        test3_rt: 2265 [cc06c090,  88] (not blocked)
R        test3_rt: 2266 [cc06ccb0,  87] (not blocked)
D        test3_rt: 2267 [cc1286c0,  86] blocked on: [ce127650] {(struct
semaphore *)(&inode->i_sem)}
.. held by:          test3_rt: 2268 [ce822760,  85]
... acquired at:  vfs_readdir+0x53/0xa0
D        test3_rt: 2268 [ce822760,  85] (not blocked)
Process 2263 started the run and has just released the semaphore, it was
preempted before getting to the wait and although still running, it is
not really part of the picture.
Process 2267 is blocked on 2268 which is sleeping at
fs/jbd/transaction.c:636 which is in do_get_write_access waiting (I
believe) for a transaction to finish. Probably for kjournald to run,
since it is also in the running state. 
But the problem seems to be with 2266 where as it's trace shows:
test3_rt      [cc06ccb0]R C0371AD6 [on rq]  6824  2266   2263          2267  2265 (NOTLB)

Call Trace:

 [<c0102d00>] need_resched+0x20/0x24 (-7260)
---------------------------

.. [<c0371179>] .... __schedule+0xe9/0x840
.....[<c0371ad6>] ..   ( <= preempt_schedule_irq+0x46/0x70)
Which is not very helpful.  
So it is probably stuck in some spinning "yield" loop, which was the
reason I was writing this test to begin with!  It's most likely also
waiting for kjournald to do some work, and is starving it in a schedule
or yield loop never actually going to sleep letting kjournald do the
real work.
