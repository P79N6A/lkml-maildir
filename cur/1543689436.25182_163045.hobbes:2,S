The global space method doesn't allow for proper resource management
in systems with a small floating physical address window but a huge
bus address space to be accessed.  MPC8245's DAC scheme is a good
example of this as well as numerous Xscale PCI implementations.
Paul's suggestion would allow the removal of lots of ugly hacks.
