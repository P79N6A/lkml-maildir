We do hope the linux kernel add some code on ide-pci.c like following.
void __init ide_scan_pcidev (struct pci_dev *dev)
{
 ide_pci_devid_t  devid;
 ide_pci_device_t *d;
 devid.vid = dev->vendor;
 devid.did = dev->device;
 for (d = ide_pci_chipsets; d->devid.vid && !IDE_PCI_DEVID_EQ(d->devid,
devid); ++d);
 //Ignored by Promise
 if ((dev->vendor==PCI_VENDOR_ID_PROMISE) && ((dev->class
>>8)==PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_RAID))
 {
  printk("%s: ignored FastTrak series by PROMISE.\n", d->name);
  return;
 }
Then, we won't affect other IDE controller or ATA-RAID controllers.
We can provide our ATA-RAID controller's driver by our own.
