strlcpy.
Check '
http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=strlcpy&apropos=0&sektion=0&
manpath=OpenBSD+2.6&format=html' for details.
Originally for OpenBSD, most UNICES (NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris,
UnixWare, OpenServer) have it in libc now.
Glibc is missing it because my patch did not get accepted.
If there is interest in having this in the kernel I could come up with a patch.
