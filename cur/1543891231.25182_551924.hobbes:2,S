Any solution which involves a naive user pressing a key and a dialog 
appearing saying "Please enter the administrator password to map this 
key" is not a satisfactory solution.

That's simply not a use-case we (or, as far as I can tell, any of the 
other major distributions) are interested in. It's very difficult to 
come up with a method for providing per-user policy without it depending 
on X.

Producing KEY_PROG* by default doesn't prevent this in any way. With the 
exception of the PS/2 keyboard nightmare, we're always able to 
distinguish between different input devices and remap them if necessary. 
It's fine to require extra complexity for more complicated cases. That 
doesn't mean it's worth requiring that complexity for all cases.

That problem is already solved at the desktop level.

It's a large pile of code and it's going to have to be implemented 
multiple times in order to integrate with the different desktop 
environments. I really don't think it's worth it.
