Hmm.  I was thinking it would be compile time variable with defaults -- like
config MEMORY_HOLE
       int "Create hole at top of memory (0-512 MB)"
       range 0 512
       default "0"
       default 168 if (CONFIG_X86_PAE && CONFIG_X86_HYPERVISOR)
       default 64 if (!CONFIG_X86_PAE && CONFIG_X86_HYPERVISOR)
       help
          Useful for creating a hole in the top of memory when running
          inside of a virtual machine monitor.
Adding things to the fixmap is a separate concept, thus a separate patch ;)
