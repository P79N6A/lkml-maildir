Since we /are/ gorging ourselves in this C-reverie, I might as well:

In my first-year C programming course, one of my more seasoned (and
phlegmatic) professors recommended that we get used to using 
if (1 == x)
instead of
if (x == 1)
so that, in case we /do/ miss the second '=', creating
(1 = x)
the compiler will puzzle over what exactly we mean by that and ask as
for advice in the form of something like "Error: lvalue required" (or
some such), an error, in any case.
Just comes to mind.
