I'll look at that when I have time.

I don't think this is a problem because immediately after this in pull_task it 
calls enqueue_task() which always updates p->array in recalc_task_prio(). 
Every enqueue_task always calls recalc_task_prio on non-rt tasks so the array 
should always be set no matter where the entry point to scheduling is from 
unless I have a logic error in setting the p->array in recalc_task_prio() or 
there is another path to schedule() that I've not accounted for by making 
sure recalc_task_prio is done.

The hot unplugged cpu's prio_rotation will be examined, and then it sets the 
prio_rotation from this runqueue's value. That shouldn't lead to any more 
problems than setting the timestamp based on the hot unplug cpus timestamp 
lower down also in pull_task()
p->timestamp = (p->timestamp - src_rq->most_recent_timestamp) +  
this_rq->most_recent_timestamp;
Thanks for looking!
