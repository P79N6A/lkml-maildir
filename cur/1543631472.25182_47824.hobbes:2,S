2.5.17, USB onboard Abit BE6, modem ADSL Speedtouch USB :
1) uhci without loading the modem driver :
# modprobe uhci
# rmmod uhci
OOPS (not logged)
kernel: kmem_cache_destroy: Can't free all objects cff416f8
kernel: uhci: not all urb_priv's were freed
2) usb-uhci uhci-hcd usb-uhci-hcd produce no visible difference in the
operation of the modem (62 kbytes/s for 608 kbits/s connexion speed).
