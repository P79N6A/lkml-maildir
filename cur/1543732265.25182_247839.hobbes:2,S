Just a question from a kernel-almost-illiterate. Could this explain the
behavior of my laptop yesterday, reading a damaged DVD? I had to wait almost
one full minute of retry until being able to kill xine... 
If maintaining the retries, it could be nice to allow at least kill -9
between them. I do not know if that's foolish and/or impossible, so please
do not bash too hard... 
Have a nice day,
