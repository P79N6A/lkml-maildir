I don't know. irqs_off_preempt_count() could get used someplace else,
where you would want to flip the preempt_count() check .. It seems sane
to combine your patch with mine ..
irqs_off_preempt_count() (!__get_cpu_var(trace_cpu_idle) && preempt_count())
You can't call __get_cpu_var() without the a positive preempt_count(),
so the check seems backwards regardless of the other factors ..
