Hmm, I'm using the same board here since two weeks. openSUSE 10.2 (i586, 
kernel 2.6.18.{2,8}) didn't installed properly even with noapic (problems 
with eth device while installing from nfs server :-(, temporarily work 
arounded with an e1000). I found a BIOS update necessary for proper apic 
operation. No problems since then, but not using a dvb card in there 
either, since my vdr is a seperate system ;-)..
Cheers,
   Pete
