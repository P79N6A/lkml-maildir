Show me how you will implement a closed loop controller where the
application is _not_ implemented as a kernel module. I would really love to
do it this way, but unfortunately no one of the realtime programmers has
found a way how it can be achieved so far.

Unfortunately, in the automation field nearly all applications are
closed-loop, and that means that the application itself is time critical.

Perhaps in your life :-) It's different in mine, in Karim's, Wolfgang's,
Bernhard's, Steve's, Stuart's, Paolo's, Guennadi's, Thomas', Massimo's,
Pierre's, Lorenzo's, Giuseppe's, Erwin's, Dave's, Ian's, Alex' (just to
mention the RTAI team) and in that of all the thousands of engineers who
are working with Linux and RTAI every day. 
Please, take into account that there are people out there wo are working
with Linux in automation and control applications every day, and their
bread and butter _is_ realtime stuff. My experience is that this is
sometimes really hard to understand for people who normally work on
problems from the IT industry, you are not the only one.
Realtime may be someting exotic for "normal" PC users, but in the whole
industrial embedded world it is completely different.
