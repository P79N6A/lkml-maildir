Ahha, this message. Sorry, we have not understood each other.
I used old fornax mailling list and someone told me not to do that. I
agreed to not use fornax ml any more (and changed my muttrc). When
I'll have something to say about swsusp-2.4, I'm going to use new list
address, but I did not want to imply that I'll send swsusp-2.6 stuff
to that list.
[I'm ccing this message to swsusp@sf, that should clear up any
confusion].
