*sigh* sorry for wasting your time, I found my problem.
Since I thought libata worked like my old ata drivers and 2.6.19 was
booting well, I reconfigured my kernel source and changed
CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y to CONFIG_BLK_DEV=m, since I genuinely thought I
wouldnt need additional disk drivers since I never needed them for
IDE. I compiled the kernel and all but never copied over the bzImage
over to /boot/
Now, I grabbed the config from 2.6.19 , copied it to 2.6.20, ran a
make oldconfig && make && make_modules and copied the bzImage to
/boot/. Of course, the 2.6.20 image I try to boot DOES contain the
CONFIG_BLK_DEV=m , so it wont find any disks, since the module is not
active (I dont use ramdisks).
I reconfigured 2.6.20 with CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y , and its working now.
idiot I am, what else can I say.
Again, sorry for wasting your time.
