The changeset in the kernel is too risky _without_ the changes I described.
Hence the repeated use of the word "incomplete."
* The patch has transition issues, when you shuffle users from one 
device driver to another.  Existing change should not be deployed 
without ensuring breakage is unlikely.
* The new driver is missing module unload support.  Existing change 
should not be deployed without this.
* DOCUMENT the user visible changes.  Existing change should not be 
deployed without this.
