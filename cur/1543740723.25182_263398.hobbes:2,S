Yes. So?  Why would it be freed? It's left how it was until it
is needed. Freeing it would waste CPU cycles.
This cannot be a problem unless you are inventing some sort
of hot-swap memory thing. If so, you need to make a module that
tells the kernel memory manager to free everything so you
can remove and replace the RAM.
