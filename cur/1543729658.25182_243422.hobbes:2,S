Hi Michael,

I assume this problem is with the Nvidia binary-only driver?  My guess
is that the driver doesn't call pci_enable_device() before using
pci_dev->irq.  I don't have source for that driver, so I can't verify
this.
If the driver is from Nvidia, please contact their technical support
and request that they fix the driver.  I can help explain the issue if
necessary.
I also noticed this in your dmesg:
	floppy: controller ACPI FDC0 at I/O 0x3f7-0x3f7 irq 6 dma channel 2
	Using anticipatory io scheduler
	Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
	floppy0: no floppy controllers found
I hope that you have the floppy controller disabled in your BIOS,
or at least have no floppy drives connected.  Can you confirm that?
I expected that ACPI would not report the controller at all in such
a case, but it looks like yours reports the controller with a zero-
length I/O port region.  I probably should check for that.
If you do have a floppy drive, it probably doesn't work anymore
unless you specify "floppy=no_acpi".  If this is the case, we'll
have to figure out a quirk or something to make it work.
Thanks for the testing report!
