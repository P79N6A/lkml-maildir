I reverted these two patches and rebooted. No such luck; I noticed that immediately
after starting gpm and X and moving my Logitech MX700 mouse to start the Konsole,
I had many events/0 processes that were defunct. No Oopses at all. Here is the
relevant part of dmesg:
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver hiddev
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver hid
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: v2.0:USB HID core driver
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev 1.1.
serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12

If you want the rest of the USB parts, I can send that too.

[*] - This is a patch I added to mousedev.c at the end of mousedev_connect() -
when the input core connects a new device to mousedev, this message prints the
devnode it made it available on. It's just a debugging patch.
