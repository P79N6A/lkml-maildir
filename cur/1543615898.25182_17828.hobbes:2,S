Release 2.0.3: Sun Jan  6 19:04:28 EST 2002
	* Massive autoprobe rules update by Giacomo.
	* Vital symbols (those that are critical, like disk drivers for 
	  potential root devices) are now forced to Y when the autoconfigurator
	  finds their hardware.
The autoconfigurator is much snmarter now, but running a manual
configure afterwards is recommended.
This release also fixes a bug in field entry of hexadecimal symbol values.

"Since there is no such entity as 'the public,' since the public is merely a
number of individuals, the idea that 'the public interest' supersedes private
interests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights of
some individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others."
