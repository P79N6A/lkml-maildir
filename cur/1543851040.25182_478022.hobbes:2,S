Gaah.
And I have SYSFS enabled, so I should have seen this warning.
But I've become innoculated against warnings, just because we have too 
many of the totally useless noise about deprecation and crud, and ppc has 
it's own set of bogus compiler-and-linker-generated warnings..
At some point we should get rid of all the "politeness" warnings, just 
because they can end up hiding the _real_ ones.
"pm_register is deprecated" etc - I get almost a hundred lines of warnings 
in my default build (and half of those are sadly due to powerpc binutils, 
that I can't do anythign about: "section .init.text exceeds stub group 
size" etc, which is harmless _other_ than the fact that it helped hide the 
real warnings just because I've grown too used to not looking too 
closely).
