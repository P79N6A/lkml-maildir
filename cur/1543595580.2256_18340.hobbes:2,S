Hi,
 what is the current relation between the reiserfs patches at
namesys.com and the 2.4.5-ac series kernel?
 Namesys seems to have a small one for the "umount" problem and two 
bigger ones (knfsd and knfsd+quota+mount). All apply cleanly to vanilla
2.4.5, but the bigger ones fails against ac18 and ac19 (earlier ones
also I would guess). Are some of the knfsd/quota fixes already in -ac?
Thanks
Martin
