I noticed the failures start when there are 2 concurrent disk accesses
(copy something from fw disk on shell 1 and it runs fine; start to
copy something TO the fw disk on shell 2 and a "management write failed"
error appears after 1-2 sec. with the orb timeout after a looong time)
I didn't investigate it further and switched back to the old stack.
Thanks,
