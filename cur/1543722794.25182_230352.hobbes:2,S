Hi,
like in the other thread, I also think there is something fishy about 
staircase 7.4.
Now when I compile something int the backgorund (eg. xine-lib, without 
setting higher nice value) and work in kdevelop at the same time, here 
compiling takes "endless" (it finishes, but takes minutes for what 
should be done in seconds) time.
Revertung to staircase 7.3 (on ck1) it seems to be ok.
