Hi!
While searching for usable framebuffer for velo, I
tried using macfb from 2.4.0-test? with strange font.
 It works okay for
command line but breaks for more advanced uses such as
uemacs.
I'm now running 4-bit-packed pixels driver, which sucks
because it AFAIKcan't do non-8 width. Is there some other
fb for me to try?
