No, this is the kind of thing that openssl is designed for. Someone's
already done the hard wofk for you, just use it. :-)
If you really want alternatives, you could investigate Peter Gutmann's
cryptlib. If you're distributing this, though, bear in mind that almost
every machine will already have openssl, while not many will have cryptlib
installed.
