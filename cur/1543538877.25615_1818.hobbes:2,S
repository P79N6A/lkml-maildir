Yeah.  What's going to happen when we are like Windows 2000 and have
20,000+ device drivers?  Wait four years between each release of Linux
(and buy Linus 200 lbs. of Methamphetamine a month so he can stay awake
around the clock and fix them all?).  I guess poor Alan will have to
give up his weekends and vacation for the next decade.  
People are motivated to update drivers because they release a new board
or hardware device and want to SELL IT FOR $$$$ (which is probably an
alien concept for someone at a non-profit organization like gnu.org --
no offense).  If their drivers are broken NOONE WILL BUY THEIR BUSTED
BOARDS.  THis is exactly how we enticed folks to upgrade drivers in
NetWare.  We'd bust them then tell our customers to buy some other
vendors card that worked.  You'd be amazed how fast these companies will
their hot little asses in gear and fix stuff when their packetbooks are
being affected.
