I'm not subscribed to the list and I use lynx and a small mda
called msmtp, so I know it's awkward (perhaps mostly for me).
But, that's my setup.
Perhaps if the list had a followup/reply option, I could use that in lynx.
But, the list just seems to be useful for reading purposes.
Perhaps I could access the list through a newsreader and the
replys would be threaded/referenced.

I have no opinion on which one is better.
I prefer tar because I have more experience with it, and it works.
It seems to be the most used archiver in the UNIX world.
   >Unless tar would be inordinately larger than a cpio implementation
   >(I can't imagine, but I'm not a coder!) I would prefer it.

No one has explicitly told me that.

Right, an initramfs can/should replace the old initrd method, but
it should be comparable and have a filesystem like tmpfs as an option.
The old initrd method could use any filesystem for the initrd
that the kernel could support, but now with initramfs all you
have is ramfs.
If you add tmpfs to initramfs you make initramfs comparable enough
(on the filesystem level) to replace the old initrd method.
Initramfs is already ahead of the old initrd method on other levels.
   >But, it can also be used to hold and run a complete Linux system,
   >so a more robust filesystem (tmpfs) is useful.
   >>What makes you think tmpfs is more robust than ramfs? What do you mean
   >>with a "robust filesystem"?
I've used tmpfs and ramfs, so it's based on experience.
I'm sure someone could give you a more technical answer, but if
you're a coder you would probably already know.
For one, if you do "dd if=/dev/zero of=foo" on a ramfs the system
will lock up.
