Maybe I'm blind, but I can't see how this works without races for
bridge device drivers. Imagine for example what happens when I rmmod
a usb hcd driver. Its module use count should be zero as long as the 
devices attached to it are not in use, right?
When I e.g. open a file in directory of a device behind my hcd, the 
devices use count is incremented but can still remove the driver.
Reading the file after module unload then can do bad things if the
show() callback was inside the hcd driver.
Did I miss the obvious anywhere?
