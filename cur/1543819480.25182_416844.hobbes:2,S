Hi folks,
A quick question for y'all about in-kernel uses of netlink.
What's the current collective view about unifying all users behind
some common abstraction? Right now, we have things like connector,
uevent, etc. doing their own thing. I'm not even going to think about
the network code (the real reason this exists in the first place!) for
a moment.
Jon.
