That really sucks.
If you remove the scsi_load_identifier, does 2.5 boot?
We can black list your device, never sending it INQUIRY page 0.
Since there is one disk like yours out there, there are probably more,
so we should add a module/boot and maybe config time option to disable
the INQUIRY page 0.
Anyone have some other suggestion, besides throwing away the disk?
