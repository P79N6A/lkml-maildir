rebooting to 2.4.22 results in a perfectly working network connection,
even with auto-negotiate on both the card and the switch. so i am
hestitant to blame the cables or the hardware. unless, of course, my
cables have the ability to detect which OS i'm running. :)
the result is 100% predictable: boot to 2.6.x, network problems. change
the settings on the device or the switch - network problems. boot
back to 2.4.22 with auto-negotiate everywhere, perfect connection. alas.
