Adaptec 7890 with Western Digital:
	Model: WDIGTL   Model: WDE18310 ULTRA2  Rev: 1.30 
It works with 2 other drive types, but not the WD.  
It *DID* work in 5.1.20 (still does if I put the old driver in the
new kernel).  Note that it broke with 5.1.21 when alot of changes
were made for 7890's.
This affects *two* different systems, each with a 7890 and each with
a WD as a 2nd or third drive.  So it is not just 1 bad drive or 1 bad
controller.  System is a Dell 410 that has the 7890 on the motherboard
with a Dell bios. 
Symptom:  Continual SCSI timeouts and resets when trying to mkfs 
	the drive (1 big
	partition).  System effectively hangs -- entire SCSI bus is
	locked up even for the drives that work.  Basically, I do
	a 'umount -a' in single user before running this "test".
