The older chips dont do UDMA. Then a lot of the next range of chips do
UDMA but not 48bit command so you can end up in PIO mode. Possibly our
logic for this needs tightening now we use lba28 commands whenever 
possible, so an LBA48 capable disk under LBA48 limit size is drivable
entirely in LBA28 safely.

Simplex DMA needs some fixing for one. That should only bite you if you
have a set up something like
hda -> unused
hdb -> unused
hdc -> DISK
hdd -> unused
in which case we assign the DMA engine to hda/hdb!
