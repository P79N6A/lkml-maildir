Well running without battery might cause problems, why disable a fine
UPC when it's there. ;-)

One last straw you might try, is building all the different cpufreq
drivers as modules, and trying if modprobeing one of them might work.
They seem to all behave slightly differently with respect to what they
assume to be true from the ACPI reported values, and what they try on
their own.
