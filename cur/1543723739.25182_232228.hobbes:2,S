That would by far be the superior approach. The data gathering really
does belong in the fs (it's just a larger fs block size) and would rid
the driver of the elevator hacks it's currently using. Plus all the data
gathering code, which has been notoriously buggy and hard to get right
and deadlock free (in the past at least for 2.4, I haven't worked on
this for a long time so it's not a comment on 2.6 code quality).
That would basically allow the merge of the remaining setup code into
cdrom.c. It needs someone to do the actual UDF work though... The
upside is that you would get automatic support for other devices as
well, such as the 8KiB UDO.
Ideally, someone would add support for bigger PAGE_CACHE_SIZE :)
