No; wrong; please pay attention.
Both parameters of __builtin_expect() are long ints.  On an
architecture where there's a pointer type larger than long[1],
__builtin_expect() won't just warn, it'll *fail*.  Also, on an
architecture where a conversion of a null pointer to long results in
a non-zero value[2], it'll *fail*.  That makes it non-portable twice
over.  Wouldn't you agree?
Allow me to quote gcc's documentation:
   Since you are limited to integral expressions for exp, you should use constructions such as
        if (__builtin_expect (ptr != NULL, 1))
          error ();
   when testing pointer or floating-point values.
Could you please believe the docs?
[1] Yes, they exit.
[2] I don't know if they exist, but they're allowed by ANSI C.
