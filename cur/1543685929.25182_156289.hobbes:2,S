So it is broken if passed a "long long"?  The documentation says "you
are limited to integral expressions".
...You're right.  The documentation is wrong.  It's strictly takes
"long int" arguments and returns a long.

A pointer really should fail on all architectures.
Fortunately you do get a warning.
