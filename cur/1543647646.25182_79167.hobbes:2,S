Huhu!
Just a word on this one: I recently came across some heavy performance problem
regarding a setup with about 225 000 routes. It looked as if TCP experienced a
tremendous slowdown to about 50 KBytes/sec throughput, whereas UDP worked
pretty much normal. This was a 2.2.19 kernel with equal-cost-multipath enabled
and large routing-tables enabled.
The reason I am writing this is: please keep in mind situations like this with
several hundred thousands of routes in one box. This is a familiar setup for
the routing guys - and not a "just" case ;-)
Thanks for lending an ear.
