Oh, there's another problem built into this method as well.
Instead of one "tweak" depending on one configuration option, it suddenly
depends on a whole load of configuration options.  You change one of these
options, and you rebuild everything that uses the asm/tweaks.h (or whatever
the filename was.)
IMHO this is a backward step. ;(
