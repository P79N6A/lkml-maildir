Hi Zach,
	I think it's OK.  To clarify, it's only fatal when the guest changes
them in a way that will fault if they're reloaded: not any change.
Lguest doesn't support LDT, so that's not a problem.

These two go through load_TLS -> lguest_load_tls which is patched by
this same change to load 0 into gs before doing the hypercall.  The
other segment registers are set by the kernel, and so we know they don't
refer to changing entries.
Is there anything I've missed?
Rusty.
