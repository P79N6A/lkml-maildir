You can just send me patches with the new device ids, in the format
described in Documentation/SubmittingPatches, and that will get the new
devices supported properly.
I also have a few questions as to the speed of the current driver (it
sucks).  I have a patch that was posted to the linux-usb-devel mailing
list to improve this, but it's only working for about half of the users.
Are there differences with the different airprime devices that we should
be aware of?
Anything else that you feel that would help make the driver better would
be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
