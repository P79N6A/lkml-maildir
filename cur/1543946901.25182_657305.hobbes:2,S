Re suspend to ram, I agree. No argument there. Re hibernation, I think 
your assertion that it will be trivial to get rid of it for hibernation 
is just plain wrong. Perhaps you don't understand the issues as well as 
you think you do.
Re arguing that the reality of userspace drivers is broken doesn't help 
here: Yeah, I know. But sometimes if you point out broken ideas for long 
enough, people do actually listen. Or you learn. Or both.
Frankly, I don't want to debate the issue either. What I really want is 
just to have a hibernation implementation that works, is flexibile, 
reliable and quick, and one that I don't have to keep maintaining. 
Unfortunately for me, most people seem to be more concerned with fixing 
hypothetical problems than with giving users something they can actually 
use.

I know. I'd submit it, or work on breaking it into pieces and submitting 
them one at a time, but that seems to me to be a waste of time.
