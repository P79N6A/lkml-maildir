I have put the idle=C1halt patch that Ross released a little while back
now into Gentoo-dev-sources-2.6.3 as I reported to the list yesterday. I
no longer use the old apic_tack=2 patch. I have been playing silly
buggers with hardware, but so far the PC has made it to 11 hours and now
7 hours with no issues. 
After those 11 hours I decided I'd change the PC setup in here and
disconnected a fan and a hard drive and moved my server s/w (apache etc)
to this PC so I only have one in here fpr now.
Right now, CPU is at 34C which is only 1-3C higher than with the other
patch, including having one less fan sucking air out the back of the
box. Motherboard is actually lower (27C) than before (29C). Ambient room
temp is normal.
After those 11 hours, I am quite sure that on normal use (ie not
compiling) the motherboard and cpu was 1-2C lower than with apic_tack=2.

Craig
