Just in addition, to point this out more clearly:
I personally don't suspect smartmontools having some
problem.
I run debians smartmontools package since a long time
and it does the selftests a long time as well. It never
had problems with it, it wasnt updated close to first
occurence of the problem or changed in any other way.
I have 4 disks, 2 on the onboard VIA controller, 2 on
the Promise. The problem always occured on the Promise
(like Henrik pointed too) disk.
I more suspect any kernel ide <-> promise-driver timing
problem. Maybe smartmontools makes it more possibe that
this timing problem occurs, maybe not (with Henriks
answer to my question I rather favorite the 'maybe not'),
maybe it's even just some load issue making the problem
occur.
