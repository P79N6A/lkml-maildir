This is a "not very funny" problem indeed.
Potential solution: Have a function-pointer that is always in the kernel.
ide-mod (or non-modular IDE) make that pointer equal to the ide_xlate_1024
functionaddress. And, of course, make it NULL again on module removal.
msdos.o checks this function-pointer and only performs the relevant checks
if the function-pointer is not NULL.
Good:
* "Only" 4 bytes (8 on 64bit platforms) overhead for the kernel
Bad:
* This is a kludge. 
* If ide_xlate_1024 is needed for non-IDE as well, this does not work.
