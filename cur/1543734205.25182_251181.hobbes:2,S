The 5518 version of the IDE controller has a config bit which (re)maps
the main config registers to 5513 compatible offsets. So the 5513 code
can be used with some minor tweaks. If you don't use the remapping you
have to modify / rewrite quite a portion of the code in order to get it
working with the 5518 chip version.
