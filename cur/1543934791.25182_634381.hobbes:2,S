Since I'm one of those people that sent "Codying style fixes" patches
I give my contribution to this discussion as well.
I think that _one_ of the reasons that made a few people sent this kind of
patches to the list is because checkpatch.pl is far better then any other
 kerneljanitor scripts/easy task and _seems_ to be an easy way to start
understanding the code, creation of patches and process in general.

Yes please do that.
Even if fixing errors reported by checkpatch.pl still sounds like a
useful way to spent a couple of hours.
Maybe our mistake was to send the patches to lkml instead of to
trivial@kernel.org
or to kerneljanitors?
I mean, I now understand the rationales behind your complaints but I
don't think it's
 good idea to discourage people willing to perform easy task.
They just need guidance in order to be useful.

Agreed.
