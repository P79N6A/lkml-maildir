No, I'm suggesting that at all.

As far as I can see, though, implementing this gains less than we
stand to loose.
What if the first SYN packet, or the response to it is lost, (which is
more possible on congested links, which is when ECN would be most
useful), and we disable ECN - then we loose out on functionality we
could have, and the work around is actually detremental to
performance.  Once 99% of internet hosts support ECN, we could be
loosing more than we gain.
If a site is unreachable, ECN can be disabled, and the RFC violating
equipment is easily identified.  Automatically disabling ECN just
hides the problem from the user, who might then not be benefiting from
ECN, and will quite possibly accept the degraded performance as
normal.
