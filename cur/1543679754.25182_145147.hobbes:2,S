Subject: [2.5 patch] remove all #include <blk.h>'s
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
the attached patch against 2.5.74 (gzip'ed due to it's size) causes
blk.h to print a warning and removes all uses of blk.h. I've tested the
compilation in 2.5.74 with a .config that tries to compile as many
drivers as possible.
Please either apply it or send a short note that you don't want to apply
it.
TIA
Adrian
