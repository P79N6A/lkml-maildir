ok, I see, so both interfaces are replying to the arp request but this time, the first interface to reply, eth0, will have its
arp reply filtered by the arp_filter as ip_route_output will indicate eth1 as the outgoing interface for a packet that has its
source set to the ip to resolve, which has a source route policy entry to point to eth1, is it ?
But then, by curiosity, is there some reasons why two different interfaces shouldn't be in the same subnet ? I was in this
impression having configured some cisco routers which don't even accept this configuration. Is it possible on other network
devices ? Is there any theoretical justification ?
thanks for your explanations,
