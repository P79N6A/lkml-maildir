Your bug report did not include the registers (EAX, EBX, etc.).
Are they in your system log?
The problem was caused by a corrupted page cache:
The offending instruction belongs to  __find_page(), pagemap.h, line 74.
Can you reproduce the problem?
I noticed you use a non-SMP kernel, but could you post some details
about your configuration?
(filesystems, compiler, etc)
Regards,
	Manfred
