Nonsense.  Mutexes are by default always private.  They explicitly
have to be marked as sharable.  This happens using the
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared function which takes
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE or PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED in the second
parameter.  So the former _is_ clearly used.

No, why?  The kernel already does recognize private mutexes.  It just
checks whether the pages used to store it are private or mapped.  This
requires some interaction with the memory subsystem but as long as no
crashes happen the data can change underneath.  It's the program's
fault if it does.
On the waker side you would search the local futex hash table/tree
first and if this doesn't yield a match, search the global table.
Wakeup calls without any waiters are usually rare.
