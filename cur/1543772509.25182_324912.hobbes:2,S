this is a misconception - there's been a few dozen patches steadily 
trickling into mainline that were all started in the PREEMPT_RT 
patchset, so this "RT stuff", both the generic arguments and the details 
are very much relevant. I wouldnt be doing it if it wasnt relevant to 
the mainline kernel. The discussions are well concentrated into 2-3 
subjects so you can plonk those threads if you are not interested.
