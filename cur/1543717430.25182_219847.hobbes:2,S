I think it should be reversed.
One very useful application for cowlinks is for virtual machine (UML)
and chroot jail setups, where an entire filesystem tree is copied
perhaps hundreds of times on a single disk.  I'm surprised we didn't
think of this earlier, as it's potentially one of the most useful
applications for cowlinks.
In that scenario, cowlinks would save enormous amounts of storage and
potentially save memory too.  However to be useful at all, they'd need
to have accurate POSIX semantics: that is, cowlinks must behave very
much as a storage optimisation only.
That means stat() should return ino==2.
