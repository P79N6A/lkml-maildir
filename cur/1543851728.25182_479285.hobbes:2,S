>how to by hand build a module.
Compilation has too many flags and too many steps to be reasonably done 
by hand. Unlike *cough* BSD or Solaris, the Linux kernel makefile system 
is designed to reasonably support external modules using all the 
necessary parameters the kernel you are compiling for needs. You know, I 
always get a shudder when I have to think of Solaris not having 
MODVERSIONS or even VERMAGIC -- it is dangerous because it allows you to 
build stuff that can fubar more easily.

Who said they are big? Look at 
http://jengelh.hopto.org/f/oops_ko.tar.bz2
 for a _really_ simple module.
