It fails for the RT case, yes. It should still be true for regular tasks
- if the owner tracking was accurate.

Yes, the owner getting preempted after acquiring the lock, but before
setting the owner can give some nasties :-(
I initially did that preempt_disable/enable around the fast path, but I
agree that slowing down the fast path is unwelcome.
Alternatively we could go back to block on !owner, with the added
complexity of not breaking out of the spin on lock->owner != owner
when !lock->owner, so that the premature owner clearing of the unlock
fast path will not force a schedule right before we get a chance to
acquire the lock.
Let me do that..

That's exactly what __mutex_fastpath_trylock() does (or can do,
depending on the implementation), so if regular mutexes are correct in
the face of a trylock stealing the lock in front of a woken up waiter,
then we're still good.
That said, I'm not seeing how mutexes aren't broken already.
say A locks it: counter 1->0
then B contends: counter 0->-1, added to wait list
then C contentds: counter -1, added to wait list
then A releases: counter -1->1, wake someone up, say B
then D trylocks: counter 1->0
so B is back to wait list
then D releases, 0->1, no wakeup
Aaah, B going back to sleep sets it to -1
Therefore, I think we're good.
