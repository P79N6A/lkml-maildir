Hi all,
Recently upgraded to 2.2.1.  The system is a PII-350 with 256 Mbs.
I'll post full specs if deemed appropriate.
Basically, I'm getting the following message occuring in
/var/log/messages ...
nfs: server trojan.list.icl.co.uk not responding, still trying
nfs: task 4281 can't get a request slot
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
nfs: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
[repeats for a bit, eventually stopped]
Normal?
Tris.
