Hi,
	I have enabled NTFS RW in kernel and compiled it as  a module.Everything went fine.
	I then loaded the module and mounted my win2k drive which is /dev/hda12.
	This is the output of mount 
	/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part12 on /mnt/12 type ntfs (rw)
	As you can see /dev/hda12 or part12 is mounted rw.
	Even i tried this 
	/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part12 on /mnt/12 type ntfs (rw,uid=0,umask=022)
	When i cd to /mnt/12 and do
	Foo:/mnt/12# ls
	RECYCLER
	System Volume Information
	Foo:/mnt/12# mkdir check
	mkdir: cannot create directory `check': Operation not permitted
	Foo:/mnt/12# touch try
	touch: cannot touch `try': Permission denied
	Foo:/mnt/12# echo hi > foo
	bash: foo: Permission denied
	Foo:/mnt/12# 
	Why aren't the commands working. I am sure i have enabled RW in kernel.I
        did it twice.
	kernel version is 2.4.21.
	
	What should i do to create a directory or file in NTFS drive (/mnt/12).
	Do i need special tools or how do i do it ?
Thank you
Nik
