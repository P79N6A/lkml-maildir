Maybe I'm thick, but this whole id_resue layer seems rather obscure.
As it is being positioned as a general-purpose utility it needs
API documentation as well as a general description.

Please use static inline, not extern inline.  If only for consistency,
and to lessen the amount of stuff which needs to be fixed up by those
of us who like to use `-fno-inline' occasionally.

A lot of the functions in this header are too large to be inlined.

Please, just open-code the locking.  This simply makes it harder to follow the
main code.

hm.  We seem to have a global private freelist here.  Is the more SMP-friendly
slab not suitable?

Recursion!

Please tell us a bit about this id layer: what problems it solves, how it
solves them, why it is needed and why existing kernel facilities are
unsuitable.
Thanks.
