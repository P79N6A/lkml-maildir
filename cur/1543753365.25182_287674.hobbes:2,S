There's a collection of test summaries from jack_test3.2 runs at

Tests were run with iso_cpu at 70, 90, 99, 100, each test was run twice. 
The discrepancies between consecutive runs (with same parameters) is 
puzzling.  Also recorded were tests with SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR.
Before drawing any hardball conclusions, verification of the results 
would be nice. At first glance, it does seem that we still have that 
fateful gap between "harm minimisation" (policy) and "zero tolerance" 
(audio reality requirement).
cheers, Cal
