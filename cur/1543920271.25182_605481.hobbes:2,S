And we are telling you that, in a modern hotplug world -- yes even on a 
laptop -- you are clinging too much to assumptions that were never 100% 
true in the first place, and much less so on today's laptops.
When you can unplug a SATA drive from a laptop, and plug it back in via 
USB, you can see how unwise it is to hardcode device names into your fstab.
We invented udev, sysfs, mount-by-label, mount-by-uuid, LVM and all 
sorts of other gadgets to make this problem go away.
If you ignore the solutions that exist to solve these problems, then of 
course annoyances will persist as the state of hardware marches forward.
