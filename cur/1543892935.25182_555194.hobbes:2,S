Ah, yeah, I cleaned up a lot of them a while ago, but they keep creaping
back.
I _really_ think we need to just get rid of that field and pass the
status in the urb callback.  That would fix this problem once and for
all.
But, from what I remember, the uhci host controller didn't make it easy
for me to acomplish this.  Or it might have been another host
controller, can't remember anymore...
So, anyone looking to make up some patches that touch every USB driver
in the tree?  I'd be glad to take them :)
thanks,
