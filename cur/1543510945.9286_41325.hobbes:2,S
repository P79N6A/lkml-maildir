Has anyone come across a good Linux app that will collect useful info
about the system hardware, and put it into a nice summary?  Something
like SYSINFO or MS Diag from the DOS world.
This would be great for linux-kernel bug reports (ie. mention it in
REPORTING-BUGS), and also very useful to me.
Regards,
	Jeff
