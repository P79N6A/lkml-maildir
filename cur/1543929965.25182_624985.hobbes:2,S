sorry to chime in again, but lately i've been thinking that the
cr0 argument is not really needed if one can ensure that calls
to the kernel open/close macros won't nest (i checked and even
in the PaX case it's easy to ensure, even desirable in fact).
in your case it's also true for now and i can't think of a situation
where you'd really want to nest in the future (that'd mean opening
up the kernel while some complex piece of code runs, more complex
than a mere memset at least ;-). what do you think?
