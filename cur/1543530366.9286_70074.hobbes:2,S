Correct.  Kernel infrastructure is developed, and Donald ignores that
infrastructure.

Donald does not work with other kernel developers when creating his
driver infrastructure.  He simply appears after many months of
development and says "here it is, take it or leave it."
There was no discussion at all of his new 2.3 PCI infrastructure until I
posted my own -- at which point he pipes up.  The linux-kernel
discussion of his and my infrastructure ensued, but he would not
consider any changes at all.  "it's tested, it doesn't need to change"
That is a shitty attitude, especially when his infrastructure code has
known and obvious bugs.

Um, it is Linus source tree.
The idea is that you work with Linus and the other kernel developers,
DISCUSS your changes in an open medium, and reach a happy solution which
satisfies all.  Donald does not do this.
We cannot afford to wait many months, with broken network drivers, while
Donald does his thing.

The kernel is not static.  Drivers outside the source tree are fine, as
long as they track current kernel changes.  Donald's driver do not do
this [correctly, at any rate].

Hey, I agree....   as long as it is one big-ass driver package which
tracks the core kernel source.  Otherwise you wind up with broken
drivers which do not work well with other drivers.
An example:  Donald's network infrastructure for 2.3, pci-netif, handles
resource allocation very poorly.  If you are using a kernel with other
drivers AND his pci-netif drivers, resources can be double-allocated, or
a driver might not load due to an incorrectly-registered resource.

The kernel diverges from Donald's code because it gets more widely
tested and used than code on his web site.  People who download and use
his drivers are a small, self-selected group of users compared to those
who use the drivers in the standard kernel.
