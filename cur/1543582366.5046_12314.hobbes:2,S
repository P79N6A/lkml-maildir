Well, normally you use the ROM only as a "boot device". You copy the Kernel
into RAM and run it. Ram is not more expensive than ROM :)
What is your Reason for keeping the Kernel in ROM? Security? Do you have a
special limited Device? In that case you might want to look at the embedded
Linux Versions which run without MMU. Those might even have a decent ROM
Performance (compared to RAM).
