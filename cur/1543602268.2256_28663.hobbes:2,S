swap_out() will deactivate everything it finds to be not-recently used,
and that's how the inactive list ends up getting replenished.
But if you want to put an unconditional "refill_inactive()" after the
inactive shrink failed, just to work with the case of the active list
having a lot of interesting pages. That's not a mapped vs unmapped issue,
that's more a "maybe all the DMA pages are on the active list" kind of
thing.
