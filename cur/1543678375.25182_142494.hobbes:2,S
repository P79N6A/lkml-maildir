No prize for guessing it was tmpfs I found the problem with.
Which others?  I don't know, and wouldn't trust any answer I came up with.
Plus we can't tell beyond what's in the kernel tree itself.

I've no great attachment to my "page_cache_readahead_implemented()",
and it would be just fine to say that anyone who implements readpages
must also implement readpage, drop that part of the test.
But what you suggest above sounds much too shaky (or draconian) to me -
particularly since disobedience shows up as a hang rather than an oops.
Am I reading alloc_inode correctly, that the default it gives is
an empty_aops with NULL readpage, but a backing_dev_info with non-0
ra_pages?  How does your do_mmap_pgoff fare on a PROT_EXEC mapping
of one of those mmaping device drivers?
