Hey, that's my patch!  :-) Actually, mine has one line of difference, which
is not to set TIF_SIGPENDING when SIGCONT is blocked.  That difference is
visible to kernel threads that block SIGCONT and check signal_pending,
of which there are some though I don't recall understanding why.
I am still doing tests.
