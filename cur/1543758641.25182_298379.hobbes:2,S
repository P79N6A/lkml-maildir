Well, what exactly is the desired behavior for you?  If you have two 
network
interfaces to the same local network, the default config will pick a 
random
one (They're both equal-cost unless you tell it otherwise) and send 
ARPs and
everything else through that one interface.  If you take it down, it may
require a minute or so to update the rest of the network to the new 
hardware
address, but eventually they will figure it out.  I suppose if that is 
the
expected config, you could tell the box to send out a gratuitous ARP 
packet
when you reconfigure interfaces, but that's a userspace issue in any 
case.
As far as networking is concerned, a subnet is an atomic networking 
unit.
Everything on it is considered directly and equally attached to 
everything
else, unless informed otherwise via a switch protocol.  Any system that
doesn't follow that rule is broken.
