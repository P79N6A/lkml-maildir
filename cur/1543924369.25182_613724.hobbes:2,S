Can we get a new firmware call to do this?

How many possible handles are there?  
If the handles are lost, is the only way to clear out the HEA resources
is to reset the partition?

This means the crashed kernel now has to be trusted to shut down and
free up the resources.  Isn't trusting the crashing kernel in this way
against the whole kdump idea?
