Hi!

What kind of FIFO they have? Normal modems have FIFO for a few bytes, but
these bytes will not be decoded yet, so it'll buffer the sampled wave? If
so the FIFO must be really big :)

I do not know enough to participate on this issue, but i have a simple
question: doesn't these modems have ms-windows drivers? Does this drivers
suffer from all this problems? Because even being a crap, these modems
function well on windows most of time. It can't be so different and need
so more attention on linux.
Thanks,
