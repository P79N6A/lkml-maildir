The new PHY Layer (drivers/net/phy/*) can provide all these features  
for you without much difficulty, I suspect.  The layer supports  
handling the interrupts for you, or (if it's shared with your  
controller's interrupt) provides simple hooks to make supporting  
interrupts easy.
Is the cost of an extra read every minute really too high?  It's such  
a small fraction of the CPU time, and provides a better user experience.
