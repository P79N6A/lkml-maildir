Comparing my stuff to their work, I just do some small performance enhancements:
- I do not modify a single line on the existing VM paths - if my stuff has no
  improvement for you, then yo will not be obliged to pay any overhead
- I do not insist on :-)) ... that would block the execution of the application
  while the resources are not available
- I handle only the simplest case: private anonymous pages (...a singe PTE...)
- IWAMOTO Toshihiro provides a complete "fool proof" solution with obligation to
  cussed in the migration
