Just a minor difference is that for a 8 CPU system
Using IPI shortcut uses just 1 write to local apic
Using mask version of broadcast uses 2 writes to local apic
The stat showed no significant difference when we do the 1 extra write. But
that is for the whole system.
When we use send_IPI_mask_sequence() we use 14 writes to (two writes
for each CPU that we need to target a IPI). 
Using the same stats i used earlier, i see about 0x200 - 0x1000 extra cycles 
when using mask_sequence() on certain long runs about 100K samples.
We should probably remove the !HOTPLUG case and just use the mask version
for all cases <=8 CPUS, use physflat or the cluster mode for >8cpus as 
the case may be, instead of defaulting to sequence_IPI which seems
a little overkill for the intended purpose.
