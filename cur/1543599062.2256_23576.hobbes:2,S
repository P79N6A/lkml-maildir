Hello All,
    Recently when I login to the first virtual console, I will sometimes get
a message like this:
    bessie login: jlnance
    Last login: Fri Aug 24 12:37:18 from hazard
    Warning: no access to tty (Inappropriate ioctl for device).
    Thus no job control in this shell.
The only thing that has changed recently has been the kernels, so I assume
that it has something to do with them.  Right now I am running 2.4.8-ac9 but
it also happened with -ac7.  I dont remember ever seeing it before that.
It does not happen every time, and it seems to only occur on the ctrl-alt-F1
vitrual console.  Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanks,
Jim
