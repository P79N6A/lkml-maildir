Word "graph" is quite confusing. We don't need any graphs, we need a 
plain execution path tracing as in the attached example (this is what's 
currently done).

I think if tracer always returns machine word, as Ingo suggested, as 
"%d(%x)" it would be more then sufficient. In the rest of 0.01% of cases 
it wouldn't be hard to print a non-standard return value using 
ftrace_printk() just before returning it.

That would make ftrace a complete debug logging subsystem.
