well, at least for me, corruption/errors *started* with 2.6.18-rc1:
http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2006-07/msg00151.html
I downgraded to 2.6.17.5 and the errors stopped. Now I've upgraded to 
2.6.18-rc2 and see the same errors:
xfs_da_do_buf: bno 16777216
dir: inode 24472381
Filesystem "md0": XFS internal error xfs_da_do_buf(1) at line 1992 of file fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c.  Caller 0xc0219230
Filesystem "md0": XFS internal error xfs_trans_cancel at line 1138 of file fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c.  Caller 0xc024d717
Please see the whole error/.config/logs here:

Thanks,
Christian.
