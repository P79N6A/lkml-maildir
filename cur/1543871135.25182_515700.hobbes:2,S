Actually - that is not true at all - we have profiled these extensively across 
many workloads on various real world applications from fax machine to bar 
code scanner, to software radio, to internet radio - and that is the point - 
it all depends on what the user application/drivers that are loaded are 
doing. I can't decided what is best for the user, because I don't know what 
they are doing.

Yeah, we do - and the users who want to get the best performance - spend the 
effort in doing so - the others live with the defaults.

Maybe users on Blackfin are more sophisticated than ones using SH?
The reason we did this - is because we saw many end users doing the same 
thing, and wanted to give people a standard way to do it - that we could 
test/stand behind and give people support.

And that is the problem - the kernel doesn't know how much on chip memory an 
application which will be loaded in the future might need. The user needs to 
be able to control the amount of on-chip memory that the kernel uses - hence 
the knobs.

Embedded has never been intuitive.
Normally, the majority of end users leave things set by the default, meaning 
their application doesn't use the on-chip memory, and the kernel is allowed 
to. If they want to start using on-chip memory, they are forced to do a 
re-compile, with the kernel functions using off-chip memory, and see how much 
of on-chip memory their application uses. They calculate the difference, and 
do a little system level profiling, and put the most used kernel functions 
back.
Although this isn't intuitive., it is pretty straight forward and mechanical. 
People do it all the time.

There is a certain level of user sophistication expected when designing a 
deeply embedded application. I don't think this is a good comparison. 
Besides - I like (and use) all the knobs in KDE.
You are asking me to try to decide what is best for all the potential end 
users, with out knowing what the end user is doing. What ends up happening is 
that people make modifications (normally poor ones) and then still ask for 
help when their modifications break.
I would rather give them a supported (but arguablely confusing) method of 
customisation. (This is why it was added - end users were asking for it, and 
when we didn't have it, they would try to make the modifications themselves, 
break it, and report a bug. After telling 8 different people the same thing, 
when do you decide this is a feature you need to support?)
