No, these events I added for HAL and they were wrong as pointed out by
Al Viro and with his help we replaced them by a better solution, which
actually is the "fix".
HAL was prepared to make use of the new events and needs to be upgraded
when the kernel gets upgraded. This happens all the time as long as we
try to find the right way to interact with the kernel and need to
change the interfaces.
HAL is tightly bound to the kernel and this will countinuously happen in
the future too, cause we can't solve the problem that you don't know how
an interface works without a user and if you don't put it in the kernel you
certainly don't have a user.
Interfaces get stable by becoming good enough and not by someone that
declares them as stable. If you have a problem with that, please introduce
a list of stable interfaces where people can rely on and I will not put
any of the new interfaces that are under construction on that list. We
need to be able to use new interfaces and change them until we know that
they are good enough. It is very unlikely to get complex interfaces
right in the first place. In the mount event case they have been identified
as the wrong way to do it and got replaced.
Thanks,
Kay
