The problem with thrashing, is it not, is that we're not making 
forward progress because we're waiting for swap--that is to say, 
thrashing *is* an idle state of sorts, and so might be an ideal 
opportunity for gc methods that require heavy CPU involvement. It's 
not as if there's anything better to do....
