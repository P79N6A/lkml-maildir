Almost but not quite. It boots fine by default but if I try to set the
vga setting to a 1024x768 screen in garbles a 640x480 rectangle in the
middle of my laptop screen and freezes. This mode worked fine under
2.4.x so I know the chip is capable.
lilo.conf
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=linux
        alias=l
        read-only
        vga=0x317
        append="video=vesa:ywrap,mtrr"
relevant bit out of .config:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VGA16=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y

CONFIG_FONT_8x8=y
CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
