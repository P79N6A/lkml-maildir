Cool stuff!  I thought about using basically the same approach, but I
wasn't sure if binutils was up to the job.  I didn't know about readelf
(well, I'd read about it in the 2.10 announcement, but I didn't know
what it could do).  Basically readelf is objdump on steroids, right?
Now, is there a way to extract filenames and line numbers off those
symbols, if you build with -g?
