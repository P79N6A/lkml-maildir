How? with dma_alloc_consistent() or some special hook?
I'm just curious.

Yeah, in general that should be feasible.
One might be able to trivially allocate a small, seperate IO PDIR
just for KDUMP and switch to that. Key thing is it be physically
contiguous in memory. Very little code is involved with IO Pdir
setup for both parisc and IA64. I can't speak for Alpha/sparc/ppc/et al.

You could run the itimer but I don't see why you should.
Kdump is essentially an embedded linux kernel. It really
doesn't need to be premptive multitasking either.
Anyway, sounds like you guys are on the right track.
thanks,
