> But how it is done in 2.6.17 linux kernel? I did check this "overflow code" in new tty driver's code. This code looks like just removed. But somehow overflow in the tty buffer must be kept.
The new tty layer manages memory allocation dynamically and handles
overflows itself. Just throw data at it and the right thing will occur in
current kernels.
