I doubt it.

The sending socket has no ties at all to the receiving socket other than
that they speak TCP/IP with each other.  The receiver socket socket simply does 
not know the uid, so it cannot change behaviour based on it.
The "connection" to SO_NOSPACE is easy to explain, see the table of I/O events 
in socket(7). It is the POLLOUT event.
