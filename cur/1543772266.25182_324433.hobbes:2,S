Your logic does not work because existing MSI/MSI-X code does not allow
a driver to switch back and forth between MSI mode and MSI-X mode. A
driver can switch interrupt mode between NORMAL IRQ mode and MSI mode or
between NORMAL IRQ mode and MSI-X mode but NOT between MSI mode and
MSI-X mode. A device driver should know well which MSI mode or MSI-X
mode it wants to run when its device supports both MSI and MSI-X
capability structures. Please read MSI-HOWTO before any attempt. If you
like to continue this path, then think of a better policy of how to
manage vector sources for MSI and MSI-X allocation before making
changes.
Thanks,
