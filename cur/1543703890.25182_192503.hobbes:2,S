Whitespace-only diffs can be very useful. In particular, they are common 
when somebody starts working on a piece of code without a maintainer, and 
the old code was terminally broken wrt whitespace. Happens quite often in 
the driver world.
So I don't have any real issues with applying whitespace-only patches, and 
I much prefer them to patches that mix whitespace and bugfixes. In 
particular, if the whitespace fixes are preparation for some other 
cleanup, it's usually a good idea.
(I agree that if the whitespace fix is just random, it's usually not worth 
it).
