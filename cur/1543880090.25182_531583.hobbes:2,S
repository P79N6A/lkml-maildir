    Dell 1950/2950 indeed...
    if there is any way to catch that writing without crashing the system 
    (even to the price of some slowness) I can test it. if not, I can't 
    because all my available targets are remote administrated and involved 
    with production processes.
    if luckilly one of them gets free, I'll to apply the latest patch you'd 
    provide me. I may also try it one day I'm close to those machines, so 
    keep me in the list of up to date patches.
