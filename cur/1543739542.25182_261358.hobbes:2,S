No, it isn't. select() may not behave differently based on the O_NONBLOCK
flag at the moment of the select() call. And if a call to recvmsg() with O_NONBLOCK
cleared doesn't block and since it can't return EAGAIN, then I don't think a recvmsg()
call with O_NONBLOCK set should return EAGAIN where something like
EIO should have been returned otherwise.
