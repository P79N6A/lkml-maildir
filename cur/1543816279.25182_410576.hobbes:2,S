Looks like you're right, so good catch. You should probably try to submit your
posix mlock patch by itself then. Make sure you look at the coding standards
though, and try to _really_ follow coding conventions of the file you're
modifying.
You also should make sure the patch works standalone (ie. not just as part of
a set). Oh, and introducing a new field in vma for a flag is probably not the
best option if you still have room in the vm_flags field.
And the patch changelog should contain the actual problem, and quote the
relevant part of the POSIX definition, if applicable.
Thanks,
Nick
