It varies. If this idiom bothers you, I can split it into 2 lines.

Then the device will not be accessible as a tty device.
It may still be accessible as a network device.
On driver unload, tty_unregister_device() does nothing because
the device was never created.
In this case, tracking the return value does not change anything.
I could add a printk on error to better inform the user that the
kernel's plumbing went south.
