I see this cropping up with heavy use of VFS in text-mode
Midnight Commander. Results in lots of rubbish left in /tmp.
Present kernel: 2.2.14pre18, UP
$ cat inode-max
7168
$ cat inode-state
7170	62	0	0	0	0	0
mc's error message:
Direntry warning
Super ino_usage is 3, memory leak
Andrea Archangeli announced a patch to 2.2.13 for this on
Nov.11. Was that patch correct?
