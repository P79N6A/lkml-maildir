My opinion is that Ivan's patch followed by my patch is the best way
forward.  I see Arjan's patch as a good prototype, but it introduces a lot
of unnecessary infrastructure (and a userspace interface that I dislike).
I would like to see Ivan's patch merged ASAP as it does fix one of
my machines.  akpm has the patch from me to disable io decoding, and
intends to send it to Linus during this merge window ... that patch
becomes unnecessary if we merge Ivan's patch.
My patch is an incremental improvement that adds some of the features
of Arjan's patch without the extra infrastructure.  I don't think it's
urgent, but it does make some of our internal interfaces cleaner.
