While I admit that this will break the build, I think it's safe to say that 
there are hundreds of environment variables that will influence the kbuild 
system and makefiles. It's going to be an uphill battle if you want to fix each 
and every occurrence of a *possible* build breakage due to an environment 
variable being set wrongly.
I think it's perfectly fine for the kbuild system to expect a reasonably sane 
and clean build system. Those who want to set specific variables to influence 
their build should be able to do so as well, without getting settings removed.
In your case, I would suggest not setting this option by default in your shell ;)
Cheers,
Auke
