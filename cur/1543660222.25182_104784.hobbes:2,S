Subject: EDD bug find: wrong #define is used to declare edd[] area.

It appears to me that the wrong #define is being used to declare the
size of the EDD (BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive Services) area of the setup
parameter page.  The following lines use 'EDDNR', but I believe they
meant to use 'EDDMAXNR':  (src @ 2.5.59)
  include/asm-i386/edd.h:line 168:
    extern struct edd_info edd[EDDNR];
  arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:line 477:
    struct edd_info edd[EDDNR];
For reference:
  include/asm-i386/edd.h:
  #define EDDNR 0x1e9           /* addr of number of edd_info structs at EDDBUF
  #define EDDMAXNR 6            /* number of edd_info structs starting at
EDDBUF  */
EDDNR is the offset in the parameter page, not the number of entries.
EDDMAXNR seems to be the literal to use.  I haven't tried this fix,
because I don't use it.  Just noticed it while digging through the source.
