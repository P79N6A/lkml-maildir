Vendors generally can't tell their arse from their elbow.  The XP does
not officially support SMP operation, and AMD makes no guarantees that
putting them in an SMP configuration won't cause your motherboard to
melt, your dog to get pregnant, etc.
If you want Athlon in an SMP configuration, buy the Athlon MP.  That's
what it's for.
