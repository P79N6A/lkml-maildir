Strange thing. When entering a syscall, the int 0x80 does clear the
trap, but first it is saved into the stack. When the iret is executed,
the eflags is restored from the stack, thus single stepping is
re-enabled.
The question is: the int 0x80 can be seen as complex instructions that
is only completed after the iret. This way, I do not see why a debug
trap is not generated afer the int 0x80 and BEFORE the mov.
I reinvented the wheel and built a module that did the same thing as
a singlestep ptrace, and a the trap WAS generated after the int 0x80
completed, before the mov. 
So I think it has sth to do with the debug trap handler. 
I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BEAVIOUR is right, since if it is not stopping
after the int 0x80, ptrace is not TRULLY singlestepping.
