struct skbuff used to have a count, which was just a reference count, but 
that seems to be replaced with users.  i see that alloc_skb increments 
users now and it didn't before.  count is gone.  is this right?
there are two other changes i don't understand.  dev_free_skb used to take 
a mode flag and no longer does.  skbuff used to also have a free flag in it 
that is gone.  how is this handled now?
also, there used to be a pointer data_skb that is gone.  is the current skb 
always the data skb now?
can you tell i'm a newbie and i'm trying to port something from 2.0 to 2.2?  :)
thanks
