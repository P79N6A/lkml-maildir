Looks like it's more reproduceable when there's some writing
going on at this point - after enabling the quotas and before
remointing it read-only.  Maybe there's some unwritten quota
data left in memory at the remount, or something like that...

I'm able to reproduce it on almost any my machine.  Tried on several
production machines first ;)  And on at least two test machines.
Now I'm at home and my home PC also shows this bug (2.6.13.1 vanilla).

nmi_watchdog makes no visible difference.  Lapic is already enabled, at
least on this machine (BTW, the same behaviour happens on SMP and UP
machines, with and without hyperthreading enabled).

And hee-hoo, sysrq works!  Strange I haven't noticied it before - I think
I tried it on the laptop, maybe I pressed some wrong button...
Now, as I don't have another PC here @home, only this machine and an ADSL
router (small mips-based device wich is also running linux), and I will
not have access to another machine(s) till monday... I'll try netconsole
to the router.  Damn, why ShiftPgUp does not work as it worked in 2.4?? :(
