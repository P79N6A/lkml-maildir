I discussed this with Ted at one point also.  This is a generic problem,
not just for readahead, because "fsck" can run multiple e2fsck in parallel
and in case of many large filesystems on a single node this can cause
memory usage problems also.
What I was proposing is that "fsck.{fstype}" be modified to return an
estimated minimum amount of memory needed, and some "desired" amount of
memory (i.e. readahead) to fsck the filesystem, using some parameter like
"fsck.{fstype} --report-memory-needed /dev/XXX".  If this does not
return the output in the expected format, or returns an error then fsck
will assume some amount of memory based on the device size and continue
as it does today.
If the fsck.{fstype} does understand this parameter, then fsck makes a
decision based on devices, parallelism, total RAM (less some amount to
avoid thrashing), then it can call the individual fsck commands with
"--maximum-memory MMM /dev/XXX" so each knows how much cache it can
allocate.  This parameter can also be specified by the user if running
e2fsck directly.
I haven't looked through your patch yet, but I hope to get to it soon.
Cheers, Andreas
