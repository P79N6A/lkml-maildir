It appears to work.
I tried to figure out why the SMM message is printing out. I can't
find any reference for the #defined values in i8k.c. The only prior
source code I can find mentioning some of them appears to be from the
Windows fanio driver inside the i8kfangui source code
(i8kfangui31-src.zip). Those constants seem to have been reverse
engineered by disassembling the nbsvc.mdm (really an MS-DOS
executable) that Dell puts in the first partition of the laptop hard
drive.
Is there a valid reference for how this SMM mechanism works and what
the inputs/outputs are? There must be some other snippets of code
around because there are a few values in i8k.c which are not in
i8kfangui31-src.zip. I could help with this code if anyone has a
reliable source for this information. The i8kfangui31 source mentions
V1266, and if I strings my copy of nbsvc.mdm, I see V1323. I'm not
sure how this (incomplete) table was derived.
