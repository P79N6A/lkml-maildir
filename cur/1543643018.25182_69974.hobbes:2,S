I wasn't making any claims to have _tried_ it or anything.  I simply stated 
that it's _there_ and, I think, supported.  Personally, I've switched to 
Reiserfs (thanks, Hans!), which I'm _really_ happy with.  Yeah, I should 
investigate the other options, but, honestly, there isn't a lot of neccessity 
to.

I'm not sure if you're saying that this is a bad thing or a good thing.  FWIW, 
I think this is a wonderful feature, albeit potentially confusing to a Newbie   
For my O2 running IRIX I get XFS whether I like it or not, for Solaris I get 
UFS no matter how much it sucks (I'm not really saying that it does; I don't 
have much knowledge of it to be honest).  This multitude of choices really 
causes competition between them, and makes them all better in the long run.
Think about this:  Namesys is working on Reiserfs v4.0.  v4.0.  Hell - it's 
only been incorporated into the mainstream kernel for less than a year (at 
least by my recollection), yet it keeps advancing.  I have _no_ idea what UFS 
version Solaris 8 is using (admittedly at least somewhat due to ignorance -- 
I use Solaris because I have a good ol' SPARCprinter which alas is not 
supported by Linux), or whether they've bother to do development on it to 
make it better, faster, etc.  Yet, _we_ get this advancement all the time.  
Isn't it great?!
Ok, time to step off my soapbox and get back to work.
