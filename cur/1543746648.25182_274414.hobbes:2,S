generic_make_request() can block in get_request_wait(), but I can't
immediately think of a way in which that can deadlock things, especially if
each level is using a distinct queue.
It could certainly deadlock if a higher-level make_request() caller
required allocation of two or more requests at a lower level - all we'd
need is N/2 proceses each trying to allocate two requests.  But such a
lockup could happen in the current code anyway..
