- From the CREDITS file in the usb directory... does this mean that we
will be seeing specs or a driver for the QuickCam VC soon?

        - Many thanks to Logitech for contributing a three axis USB
          mouse.
 
          Logitech designs, manufactures and markets
          Human Interface Devices, having a long history and
          experience in making devices such as keyboards, mice,
          trackballs, cameras, loudspeakers and control devices for
          gaming and professional use.
 
          Being a recognized vendor and seller for all these devices,
          they have donated USB mice, a joystick and a scanner, as a
          way to acknowledge the importance of Linux and to allow
          Logitech customers to enjoy support in their favorite
          operating systems and all Linux users to use Logitech and
          other USB hardware.
 
          Logitech is official sponsor of the Linux Conference on
          Feb. 11th 1999 in Vienna, where we'll will present the
          current state of the Linux USB effort.
