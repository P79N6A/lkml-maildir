That is exactly what kbuild 2.5 does.  The slowdown occurs when
massaging the -MD dependencies from absolute names to relative path
names.  To support separate source and object trees, renaming of trees,
different names in local and NFS mode etc., the massage code needs a
list of where all the files are before it can convert the absolute
dependencies produced by gcc.  Reading and indexing that file for every
compile is _slow_.
Larry McVoy has sent me the source code to an mmapped database (from
bitkeeper).  Using a shared mmapped database should speed the process
up considerably.
