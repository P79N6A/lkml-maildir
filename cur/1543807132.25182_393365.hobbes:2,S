Subject: [2.6 patch] from drivers/video/Kconfig: remove unused BUS_I2C option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/3/330

The BUS_I2C option is neither available (since there is no VISWS option 
in the kernel) nor does it have any effect - so why not remove it?
Based on a report by Jean-Luc Leger <reiga@dspnet.fr.eu.org>.
