Hmm, I found that tiobench was spending a lot of time idle due to
__wait_on_inode() and get_request_wait(). I bumped up the size of
the inode wait table to 1024 and the request queue size to 16384
and saw that most of them then spent their time stuck on ->i_sem
during the initial open of the file they were going to pound on
for the duration of the run.
I determined this by just ^C'ing with kgdb and backtracing various
"stuck" processes. I think various profiling patches might be able to
give you an idea of what people are going to sleep on too.
Cheers,
Bill
