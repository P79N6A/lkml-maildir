Well, I for one would rather have these verbose messages than very terse
messages (or none at all).  Actually, having the full email explanation
helps other readers just as much as it helps you, and having the subject
lines helps go back to the specific message/thread in l-k (if the patch
was also posted there).
Cheers, Andreas
