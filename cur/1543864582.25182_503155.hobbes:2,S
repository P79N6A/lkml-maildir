This is the first I've heard of this or the changes that caused this,
while I do build current git on a pretty much daily basis, -mm doesn't
get nearly as much testing.
There are many people who build on non-x86 every day, there are rather
less people who have the bandwidth for -mm as well as current git or
for tracking down changes that haven't made it upstream to make sure
everything plays nice.
If you want immediate action, I suggest you CC the authors of the drivers
when there's changes they should be made aware of, rather than deferring
to hand-waving generalizations about how no one does any testing after
the fact.
