Hmmm, after a quick look on source code one more clarification. Since 
2.4.20 one can set default mount options in ext2/ext3 superblock using 
tune2fs. If user_xattr or acl is there, then they are enabled by default 
while mounting such filesystem. However default mount options field in 
superblock is by default empty, so user_xattr and acl are not enabled by 
default for most users. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Another thing is that a quick grep for reservation and resize options 
shows nothing in latest kernel. Are you sure that these options exist? For 
sure reiserfs has resize option.
