I've tried to add several functions to the backlight core
({s,g}et_{brightness,power}) and they were rejected. Thus all the
locking is spread over the drivers. I agree it's faulty right now.
It's still easier to move to backlight core functions than to fix all
the drivers.
Because I am responsible/wrote for the broken code, how should I
proceed?
