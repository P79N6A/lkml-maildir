So, you're saying that the LOCK and UNLOCK primitives don't actually modify
memory, but rather simply pin the cacheline into the CPU's cache and refuse to
let anyone else touch it?
No... it can't work like that. It *must* make a memory modification - after
all, the CPU doesn't know that what it's doing is a spin_unlock(), say, rather
than an atomic_set().
