Sorry. It was said 1000 times already but I can repeat once more just for you:
101% reliability => HARD real time => RTLinux. Period. If you NEED 101%
reliability then stop even THINKING about normal Linux already. It's NOT
for you.

It can be expected. There NO WAY IN HELL to include Ingo's original patch
in kernel, so stop talking about it already. It REALLY starting to look like
Gooch/Larry prediction:
-- cut --
My guess is you'll be digging yourself in deeper and deeper,
sprinkling random hacks in random places, as Linus put it.
-- cut --
And when compared to stock kernel it's quite a big win for just six
pre-emption points so perhaps it can be justified (some of them really
look like justifyable points) and Linus will accept them.

Of course. It's easy. Use RTLinux. You need it anyway (as you said you need
101% reliability) so what's the point of discussion at all ?

Yeah. HUGE files are common in multimedia and life without ability to delete
such files is tough.

Huh ? What's "the most important points of how kernel works" ???

Basically Ingo added extra scheduling everywhere where it looked right
on first glance without deep investigation - with just few benchmarks
(AFAIK anyway).

Since there are MUCH less pre-emption points.

See above (and track LARGE discussion if you ALREADY forgot it). If you think
THIS patch is not a kludge... You are wrong. It's still a kludge. Linus accepts
kludges from time to time. But ONLY if it's showed that any other sane solution
can not be done in reasonable amount of time (say 1-2 years). Linux is real OS
for real OS and if there are no way to handle problem properly then it'll be
handled with a kludge. But first you need REAL STRONG reason to believe that
there are no sane way to handle problem (big time spent in few places of kernel
without ability to reshedule - NOT "low latency" as whole; "low latency" is just
umbrela name for quite a few problematic parts of kernel).

If such "simple diagram or pseudo code" existed in first place neither Ingo
patches nor Andrew's research was not needed.

Then start doing it. It's easy to fix things if you have comprehensive
diagram of dataflow/time wasting. It's MUCH harder to draw such thing.
I'm not sure if it's possible for Linux kernel at all (it's really easy
do draw principal diagram of dataflow in linux but what it'll buy you?
small things like sys_msync() where A LOT OF time can be spent will not
be shown there; and if you'll draw diagram of such a great detality it'll
become useless pretty fast since it'll be just translation for more or less
complete kernel source from C to some other language).
