The PIIX should be in legacy mode by default in which case it would be
on
IRQ 14/15 only. Can you post boot messages ?

Quite possibly nowhere. IDE controllers have two modes one in which they
are normal PCI devices (and use INTA) and one in which they are "legacy"
compatible and use IRQ14/15 directly so they work with pre-PCI operating
systems.

In legacy mode (the mode I would expect at boot) it shouldn't be using
INTA at all.
