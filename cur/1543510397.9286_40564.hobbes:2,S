hello,
I'm new to the list and honestly know little about what has happened with
the kernels w.r.t. ipx problems, bu do understand that some issues have been
"resolved" with the latest 2.2.xx releases.  
I am trying to upgrade my kernel to this level with no success yet.  The
problem resides in the ipx portion of my system.  Whenever I boot with
2.2.9, 2.2.12, or the 2.2.13pre11 versions, the boot process slows to a 
virtual stop after ipxd starts up.  This seems to happen only when I get a 
net connection.
My system:  IBM pc 340 (133 MHz Pentium), Debian potato (unstable release,
centered on the 2.2.xx kernel, glibc6), an olicom PCI 16/4 token ring card with
a patch for 2.2.9, 2.2.12--works with 13pre11), dhcpcd 1.3.x (or ISC's
dhclient 2.0 compiled against non-networked 2.2.9 kernel with no problems).
ISC's client doesn't connect, so I use dhcpcd despite its insistence to turn
my machine into "UNKNOWN_27" (/etc/hostname is still "kvaughan" ?).  When this
is used, the system dies after ipxd starts.  This was confirmed by booting
into single user maintenance mode, then starting services one by one out of
/etc/init.d in proper order.  Using ISC the last time I tried to boot gave
no connection and a live system.  
None of this happens when I use the old 2.0.36 kernel.  Between the two, I
change all references in /etc/* back and forth between "eth0" and "tr0" and
choose which dhcp client I want.
Other info??  Network:

Does anyone have information about this predicament?  I'd appreciate some
