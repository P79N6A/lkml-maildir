Eaxctly. The core and upperlayers are ok now. You just need 
to get all hosts adapters into hosts.o. Everything is there
except those outside drivers/scsi. It would be great if
someone with an i2o adapter could verify any changes.
Please note I already sorted the hosts.o files in the drivers/scsi/Makefile.

Yeah I've been thinking of doing this, but was afraid to srew it up. Give
it a try, and lets see what Linus thinks. 
BTW, while you are at it, could you rename sg.o to sg_mod.o. It would
look better...
