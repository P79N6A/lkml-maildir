I've now tested it with 2.2.16 and 8k block reading size - sorry about the
misunderstanding...

 Since this is designed to test raw disk performance, I wanted to reduce
 any other factors that might influence it. This includes reducing disk
 caching/buffering (by lowering memory) other disk activity (removing
 swap). It means I know it's not thrashing pages.
 The fact remains that disk performance is much worse under 2.2.16 and
 heavy loads than under 2.2.15 - what I was trying to find out was what
 was causing it. Turning off swap under 2.2.15 doesn't seem to affect
 the performance at all, so /something/ has still gone wrong with the
 disk subsystem.
 The other reason I've turned off swap is because we don't generally use it
 with our RAID boxes - there are still a number or really serious issues
 running RAID and swap - and if you run just the ext2 partitions on RAID,
 then the machine will still die with a failed disk if it swaps!

 Thanks, I have corrected my mistake now. Disk read performance (compared
 to 2.2.16) is down for one thread, but decays much less quickly as threads
 scale up.

 Thanks.

 Yup, that's the cause behind the 2.4 probs.
