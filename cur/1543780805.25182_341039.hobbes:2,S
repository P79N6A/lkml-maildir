Thanks for the feedback.  I believe the binary compilation is the same.  
It is superfluous in the sense that there is not yet a real use for it, 
but it is needed for later developement.
Xen requires page isolation of system data structures that could be used 
to override privilege.  Since they do not shadow the GDT, they require 
the GDT to be write protected.  A side effect of that is that the GDT 
must be moved to an isolated page.  Thus, the accessors to allow 
transparently moving the GDT for a paravirtual build.  There is 
deliberately no effect on the standard build.

P.S. Sorry I got your mail address wrong earlier.  I mistyped it from 
the update to the CREDITS patch.
