It depends... One serio is your keyboard port, another one is aux
(mouse). The external mouse - is it also PS/2 or is is USB? If it is
USB then it won't be listed under serio bus but rather in USB bus...
Look at /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/inputX/name attribute in sysfs -
it should give you a clue what device is connjected to a serio port.
