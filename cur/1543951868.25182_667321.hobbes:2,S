Yeah, why don't registers named LCDCONx have nothing
to do with LCD CONtrast?  Better to have named the PWM
registers PWM ... and say they could be used for either
contrast or backlight control.
The saved contrast/backlight counter value CONTRAST_VAL is
one of two PWM control registers.

That's forces the contrast signal low and disables the
PWM counter, so it won't "randomly" leave the PWM output
high when the clock is stopped (leaving at least some
displays lit during suspend).
It's possible that only CTR needed to be saved; all the
backlight support in this driver still needs work.

Yeah, that looks wrong; the patch below makes more sense.
Though it *does* behave right for some reason...
