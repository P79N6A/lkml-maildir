      Has kmemps even been supported in recent years?
      If a useful thing goes into the kernel and the developers of userland
      tools abandon the old-style interfaces in favor of the new interface,
      I'm not going to blame the kernel when I take that new interface out
      and the tools go belly-up.
      (And thats one of the nice things about devfs instead of some
      hypothetical ``do devfs, but break the interface so that it's not
      usable without some large expensive daemon'' alternative;  it may
      be a new interface, but it's backwards-compatable with the
      previous interface so I can disable it without stomping all over
      userland.)

      david parsons \bi/ The only use for a "break the interface" replacement
                     \/    is that it would get the devices registry into the
			   kernel so a devfs patch could be done against that.
