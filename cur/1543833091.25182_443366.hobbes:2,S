If the timer interrupt is not a synchronization point, what is?

Well, it does matter, otherwise the recent fix woudn't have been needed.
The timekeeping doesn't care much where synchronizations point comes from, 
but it can do a much better job, if it knows when they come.
Without knowing this the timekeeping code has to do extra work and has to 
be either optimistic or assume the worst case, neither is good for precise 
timekeeping, the first causes extra jitter, the latter very slow 
adjustments.
For example what we can do now is to provide per cpu clock sources for 
asynchronous multiprocessing systems, so they can make use of the fast tsc 
access. The problem here is one should target for small jitter and quick 
adjustments to have some margin for the worst cases, but this also means 
they at least need to know about the synchronization points and it would 
be even better to be able insert a few.

Timekeeping needs control of something, interrupts are the general 
mechanism for asynchronous events. (Unless I'm missing something) your 
clockevent concept is far too complex, simple clocksources only need to 
export a shareable interrupt source, which the timekeeping code can use to 
synchronize.
If by "tight coupling" you mean the current hardcoded timer interrupt I 
agree, but I still don't see that the clockevent stuff is really a better 
solution.

_Precise_ timekeeping.

I don't care how coupling is done (well, I do like a good compromise 
between simplicity and performace), but the timekeeping needs to 
synchronize to something.
