Hi Nick
After reading your patch, I have some crazy idea.
The atomic op + mem barrier you want to avoid could be avoided more generally 
just by changing atomic_dec_and_test(atomic_t *v).
If the current thread is the last referer (refcnt = 1), then it can safely set 
the value to 0 because no other CPU can be touching the value (or else there 
must be a bug somewhere, as the 'other cpu' could touch the value just after 
us and we could free an object still in use by 'other cpu'
Something like :
