As I mentioned earlier this call to cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue 
can deadlock
with netlink_watch. This happens if:
dev_close
    rtnl_lock                     carrier lost on device
    bond_close                 netlink related workqueue event waiting 
for rtnl
       cancel_workqueue
          spinning waiting for workq to drain
The agreed upon semantics is to never do any operation that waits for workq
to drain with RTNL held.
