I am working on backports of all the O(1) scheduler changes in 2.5, the
pending changes, and some other misc. bits.  I also have versions of the
migration_thread and affinity stuff for 2.4.
I will release a general O(1) patch and a patch for -ac soon - hopefully
tomorrow or Monday.  I have no idea if it fixes the problems you are
seeing, because I have no idea what caused a regression in the O(1)
code.

Good to hear ;)

That is the point of 2.5 :)
Development => !Stability and people need to start using 2.4 to get work
done, not reap faster and faster benchmarks times.  I seriously suspect
2.4 is performing fine right now for what you are doing, anyhow.
Also, a lot of VM work is happening in 2.4 (and not in 2.5 even, at the
moment).  2.4.19-pre has seen a few of the -aa bits merged and should
see most of the others in due time.
There is also Rik's -rmap for 2.4 ...
