Hi,
last week i got a new computer with several PCI-cards plugged in.
If i want to make a kernel for this computer i must always know exactly,
what hardware it has inside. So i had to open the case, cause my lspci was
too old and told my somewhat ATI 'unknown'...
To avoid this and to be able to create automatic kernel configs, one
solution could be to add more module info into the source of pci-capable
drivers (e.g. 3c59x.c from Donald Becker):
  MODULE_PCICLASS("0200");
  MODULE_PCIVENDOR("10b7");
  MODULE_PCIDEVICE("5900,5950,5951,5952,5900,9000,9001,9005,9055");
Then scripts could look for a driver class "0200" (Ethernet controller)
from vendor "10b7" (3Com) which supports the cards shown in PCIDEVICE
If there are two or three (or more) Vendors with same chips (like
in the Tulip-driver) the vendor string can look like this:
  MODULE_PCIVENDOR("1011,11ad,10d9");
Any comments to that?
Ciao
