The problem is that at the time K&R said this only real men (tm) were
administrators of UNIX systems. Nowadays clueless people like me are
administrators of their Linux system at home.  ;-)
With enough stupidity root can always trash his system but if as Robert
says the state of the system will be that "no allocations will succeed"
which seems to be a synonymous for "the system is practically dead" it is
IMHO a good idea to let "swapoff -a return -ENOMEM".
