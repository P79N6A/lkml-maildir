So, reiserfs and NFS are nesting i_mutex inside the mmap_sem.

I think i_mutex is fundamentally nested outside of the mmap_sem because
of faulting in the buffered write path.  I think these warnings could be
reproduced with a careful test app which tries buffered writes from an
address which will fault.
DIO just tripped it up because it *always* performs get_user_pages() on
the memory.
So reiser and NFS need to be fixed.  No?
(reiser is grabbing i_mutex from any final fput?  brave!)
