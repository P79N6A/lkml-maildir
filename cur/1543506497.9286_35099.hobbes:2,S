    Hi,
  Since I've managed to compile the 2.3.14 kernel, I get these messages:
  kernel: Trying to free free IRQ4
  kernel: Trying to free free IRQ3
  from time to time in my /var/log/messages.
  the 'IRQ4' one is always there (every 5 minutes or so) but the 'IRQ3'
only shows after closing a ppp connection.
  Any idea of what these messages means?
              Thanks,
                         DindinX
