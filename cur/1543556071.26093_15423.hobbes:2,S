So does Linux. There may be a problem with access(), or a problem
with interpreting what it's supposed to do, but device-files and
FIFOs can be opened for write on a read/only file-system.

Linux `man` states that access() checks, in addition to a file, but
also any "file-system object". However, SunOS 5.5.1 talks about files
only.
It may be that access() is not supposed to be used to check the
accessibility of devices, and that only the Linux man page is incorrect.
Cheers,
