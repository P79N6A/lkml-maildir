I agree, Also we have to be careful about the usage of cpu_online_map in 
balance_irq, there might need to be a bit of reworking of some of the 
other parts to get this working e.g. being able to determine which node a 
specific IOAPIC register is on (perhaps there might be 1 or 2 IOAPICs / 
node) etc etc. Martin?

Agreed.
