    netconsole, pritty nice debunging system... but (yes, there is 
always a but) it does not get to run.
    the method was well implemented, adding the acpi=off it sends the 
information to the receiving machine (I can even see passing a 
netconsole probing message in the machine under testing), but without 
turning off acpi it does not reach the point of loading and, 
consequently, it does not send a byte to the receiving machine.
Hence, result: empty output.
