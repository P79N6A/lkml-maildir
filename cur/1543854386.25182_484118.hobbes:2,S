I just tested it, it appears to be working now.  Both obtaining a DHCP lease
and pinging work.  I see the following from the kernel:
[232666.744627] l1: set allmulti
[232666.745361] l1: set allmulti
[232666.790816] l1: set allmulti
[232666.806160] l1: set allmulti
[232666.806990] l1: set allmulti
[232666.807157] l1: set allmulti
[232667.809358] l1: set allmulti
l1 is the name of the interface.
