Yes, there may clearly be a benefit to having a low level / high level 
separation - say STI / PUSHF / POPF, and EnableInterrupts, 
SaveInterruptFlag, RestoreInterruptFlag.  I didn't want to do that yet, 
since it adds bulk to the interface, but there clearly is some value 
there.  And as you point out, it does save a driver audit.
