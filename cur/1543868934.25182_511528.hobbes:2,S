I found something:
EPIA-EN User's Manual v.1.10.pdf, chapter 2, Slots (page 26):
PCI Interrupt Request Routing
The IRQ (interrupt request line) are hardware lines over which devices
can send interrupt signals to the microprocessor. The “PCI & LAN” IRQ
pins are typically connected to the PCI bus INT A# ~ INT D# pins as follows:
		Order 1		Order 2 	Order 3 	Order 4
PCI Slot 1	INT B# 		INT C# 		INT D# 		INT A#
IEEE1394 	INT B#
`The slot` and IEEE1394 are indeed on the same IRQ 20 when I use the
default setting of DN19 for the extra slot.
