Subject: [PATCH] fix help info about OSB4 and VIA82CXXX IDE chipsets (test11)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi
- OSB4 isn't marked (EXPERIMENTAL) in drivers/ide/Config.in so it
  shouldn't be marked so in Configure.help.
- PDC202XX driver also supports PDC20265.
- new VIA82CXXX driver removed kernel command line option (FIFO
  setting) and CONFIG_VIA82CXX_TUNING
