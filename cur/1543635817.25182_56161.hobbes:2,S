        You have network support compiled in. Are you able to get into the box 
remotely (ssh, telnet, etc)? If so, get onto the box, and mail me the output 
of `cat /proc/interrupts. I'd like to confirm something that's on my end as 
well. my guess is that  IRQ 1 is not listed. Another thing I should mention: 
I'm encountering this problem with 2.5.25, though I reported this in the 
2.5.20-dj tree. Vanilla 2.5.25 still has the legacy API there, so I'm able to 
fall back on that. I haven't run a -dj kernel since 2.5.20-dj3.

        IIRC, CONFIG_SERIO_I8042 must be set for you to have a keyboard 
present. This is the chipset that the keyboard and mouse use. This has to be 
set to y.

        Rest looks fine. give that a go, and see what you get.
