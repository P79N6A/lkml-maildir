I confess to being moderately exhasperated at the amount of talk and
patching going on in the bitmap and cpumask areas.  So when your patch
floated past with a terse description which was bristling with ifs, buts
and maybes I decided to take a pass.  
If you want to send it again, cc'ing your co-conspirators and imparting some
confidence that this darned thing is actually meandering toward a conclusion,
please feel free ;)
