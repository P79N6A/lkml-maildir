Actually, it *probably* also happened in 2.4 with apm, but it always
recovered automagically within second or so -- so it was "damn that

Same here. But I also see it happening while *only* using mouse.

Yes, it can buffer only so-many keys and if the last one it *can*
remember is press, you get an autorepeat.
