Yes, how could I have missed that. mmap_sem is indeed needed in the 
slowpath: cases (hopefully the performance impact will be insignificant,
as this is the infrequent path). I will wait for people to show me more 
problems, before I put in all the changes and publish v2 of the patch.
Btw, is mmap_sem really needed for find_extend_vma, since we are already
holding lock_kernel (which mmap/munmap also gets)?
Thanks.
