It is said in TLDP doc for the kernel that map variable is used as a
bitmask. If Nth block is free, correspondingly the Nth bit is set. How
is this implemented using the map variable? what I cant comprehend is
the significance of making map as:
"unsigned long* map"
Can someone help me in this regard!!
