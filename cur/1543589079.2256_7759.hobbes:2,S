Hi,
I am trying to add a process which is to be managed by init. I have added the
following entry to /etc/inittab
SV:2345:respawn:env - PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin svscan /service </dev/null 2> dev/console
After saving, I execute the following command:
	# kill -HUP 1
This does not start the process I have added. The process that I have added
only starts when I do:
	# init u
or
	# telinit u
PS - The process will not start even after a reboot. I have to manually do one
of the above commands as root.
My kernel version is : 2.2.19
Distro : Slackware
GCC : gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Any help appreciated.
