Talk to the Linux/Merced folks, they've been using it for 3-4 months.
So, why, you ask, isn't it generally released yet?  Mainly because 
we aren't set up to support the thundering herd.  We'd really like
to know that we can't break it before it is released.
On top of that, Linus & Co. are likely to try it out when it gets released.
That's sort of a one shot deal, in my opinion.  He isn't real likely to
try it, not like it, go back to tarballs, and then try it again.  At least,
in my experience, people switch source management systems either never or
once, but very rarely twice.  So I'd kind of like this to be as painless
as possible.
For what it is worth, we're expanding our beta to include the Linux/PPC 
crowd and if that works out we'll open it up some more.
