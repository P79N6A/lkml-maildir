I'm sorry, but that's simply bullshit. 
The GPLv2 does not state that you have to become a slave of rms and follow 
him in all things, and agree with him. Really. You must have read some 
other (perhaps unreleased early draft?) version.
The GPLv2 says what it says. Not what you (or rms) *wished* it says.
You don't enter into contracts and licenses based on wishes and intents. 
That's just not how it works.

Your view is not relevant. The fact that the "preamble" is not the 
"conditions" is what's relevant. 
The preamble is explicitly stated to be *different* from the exact 
conditions. It's not the real "terms of copying". It's there to explain, 
it's not there to *be* the license.
It's explanatory, but the wording that actually *matters* is the "terms 
and conditions".
And the fact that *you* can mentally add words to it when you read the 
license (adding a "within reason") has absolutely no relevance 
what-so-ever.
