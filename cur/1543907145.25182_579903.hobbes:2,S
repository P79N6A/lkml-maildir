 I couldn't run this because my libc requires 2.6 kernels.
 But I've managed to run wine with a game called 'Align-it!', and
I have the following result:
"""
~/tmp/ egrep -c 'modify_ldt' wine-strace.txt 
46
~/tmp/ 
"""
 I've checked the calls and none has failed. Not sure how good
this test is though.
 Maybe it could be more tested in -mm?

 Oh, that's a good tip.
 Thanks a lot,
