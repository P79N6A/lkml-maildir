    Looking at the code, SPARCs and Alpha use processor registers to
    return the FDs (they have lots of registers to use), while i386
    doesn't have that luxury, and most architectures we keep adding
    do follow i386 model on things -- even when they have a plenty
    of registers, like m68k, and ppc (very least).
