Ok, I had just picked up on the "legacy" word in the option title
and assumed that it meant deprecated.
This is what I've got now:
 config PROC_PID_CPUSET
        bool "Include legacy /proc/<pid>/cpuset file"
        depends on CPUSETS
        default y
+       help
+         This option provides the /proc/<pid>/cpuset file.
+
+         This file contains the name of the cpuset in which
+         the process is executing. For more information, see
+         <file:Documentation/cpusets.txt>
+
+         If unsure, say Y.
In general, are option titles fragile? For example, if I were to submit
a patch which changes an option's title string, is this likely to break
something or somebody?
Nick.
