thanks, Linus. i'll do all this tomorrow, see my other mail i just sent.
i'll definitely do all this 'cause i'm really curious about this thing.
(it's not even the need of sound any more. heck, i could just put in
another soundcard but that'd be too easy :)

doh, you can't image how thankful i am for your (and the other people's!)
help here. but don't waste too many cycles on this weird issue here. if it
does not break for a million users out there now - why bother at all?
perhaps it'll break later on but then we have the lkml-archives and
someone will eventually remember this thing. but no, i don't want to
discourage anyone here ;-)
regards,
Christian.
