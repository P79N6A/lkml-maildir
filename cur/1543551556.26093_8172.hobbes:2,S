util-linux is advertised as "all kernel and all (g)libc versions".
(Since recently I have a libc 4.3 system, and 4.3 is quite a lot
worse than 4.4. Maybe I won't fix util-linux to work with this
very ancient stuff, and the claim becomes "all kernel versions
since 0.99 and all (g)libc versions since 4.4".)
If anything is wrong, bug reports and patches are welcome.
