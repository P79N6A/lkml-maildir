The latter form offers no significant advantage over the former at
all - there is nothing that can be expressed as
 <name>value</name>
which can't also be expressed as
 name: value
or
 name=value
and the latter format is significantly easier to parse.
The only situation where XML really would be useful would be
some need of grouping, and this is done in /proc using directories.
(Which are also much easier to parse using existing standard tools.)
