Actually, some day that migth be a good idea, but at least historically, 
gcc has really really messed that kind of code up.
Last I looked, depending on what the initializer was, gcc would create a 
temporary struct on the stack first, and then do a "memcpy()" of the 
result. Not only does that obviously generate a lot of extra code, it also 
blows your kernel stack to kingdom come.
So be careful out there, and check what code it generates first. With at 
least a few versions of gcc.
(For _small_ structures it's wonderful. As far as I can tell, gcc does a
pretty good job on structs that are just a single long-word in size).
