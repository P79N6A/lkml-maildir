Ok, so we need another walk before we go to sleep.
But, first a question - does the swap device need to absolutely be the
last thing to stop taking requests? Or, can it stop after everything is
done allocating memory?

For most devices, it seems it could happen in the first, as well. They
should be fine with stopping I/O requests early on. It's only special
cases like swap and maybe one or two others that need an extra step,
right?
