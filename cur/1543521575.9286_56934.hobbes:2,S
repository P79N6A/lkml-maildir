I know about global constructors, but if you look closely at libc-start.c
you will see that what I said is still true.
  /* Register the destructor of the dynamic linker if there is any.  */
  if (rtld_fini != NULL)
    __internal_atexit (rtld_fini);
  /* Call the initializer of the libc.  */
  __libc_init_first (argc, argv, __environ);
  /* Register the destructor of the program, if any.  */
  if (fini)
    __internal_atexit (fini);
  /* Call the initializer of the program, if any.  */
  if (init)
    (*init) ();
The constructors you are worried about are all executed by (*init)().
We control the code executed by __libc_init_first, and in the current source
base none of it calls atexit.  Therefore, we can be absolutely certain that
the above __internal_atexit calls are safe.
