I can live with it either way.  On my SMT box, the rounding is much
worse than the actual drift, that's microseconds, but the rounding turns
it into milliseconds.

On a real SMP, this adjusting of timestamps probably helps (dunno, no
have), on my box it's doomed to do more harm than good.  To me, the only
thing that really matters is ignoring the bogus transition.
