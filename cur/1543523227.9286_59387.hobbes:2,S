i keep seeing this.  are folks aware of the hybrid (many-to-many) threads
implementation inside NSPR?  NSPR is the portable run-time which is
supplied with mozilla -- visit mozilla.org to get it (it's in the nsprpub
module of the cvs i think).
NSPR threads are *not* posix threads.  they're much more sane -- they have
no asynchronous notification.  after having worked on signal issues on
apache for so long i am so completely convinced that no async notification
is the only way to program.
NSPR can be compiled a few different ways -- the default is one-to-one
native threads on linux i think, but there's a hybrid pthreads model in
there.
it took me a little more than a weekend to port apache to nspr... it'd
probably take someone a similar amount of time to port a jvm to nspr
(maybe netscape already has one).  then you'd be able to test out the
one-to-one vs. many-to-one theories.
