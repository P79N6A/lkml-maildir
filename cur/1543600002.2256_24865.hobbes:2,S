Correct. And the comments just above there about alignment are very
enlightening; it seems that the IBM/S390 architecture has some special
needs, and I just tested that my PA-RISC kernel has the same needs.
Thus I am able to present a real bugfix.
This patch allows me to run bonnie on a reiserfs partition with pa-risc
linux.

This applies to linux-2.4.9-pa13 with
endian-safe-reiserfs-for-2.4.8.patch and to 2.4.9-ac5.
Please apply,
