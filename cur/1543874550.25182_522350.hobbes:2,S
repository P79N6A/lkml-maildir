Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.23

Guilt v0.23 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.
Tarballs:

Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git
There are two brand new commands: fork and fold. A few minor bugs related to
really unusual patch names (containing commas) were fixed. And finally, each
command has a manual page!
As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
