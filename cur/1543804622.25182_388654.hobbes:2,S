What you're complaining about here seems to be:
1. the cleanup of the entry and debug code - TRIVIAL - it's a
   cut-n-paste job.  No interface change.  Estimated time to
   resolve: 5 minutes
2. moving the machine specific boot makefile parameters into
   arch/arm/mach-* - TRIVIAL - it's a cut-n-paste job.  No interface
   change.  Estimated time to resolve: 5 minutes.
3. removing messy macros for the machine description.  Slightly less
   trivial because you need to do some investigation and then an
   exercise of about 10 subsitutions in one file.  Estimated time
   to resolve: 30 minutes.
All changes listed above to lower the long term maintainence burden of
the kernel _and_ make it easier to port to new SoCs.
Ok, so, let's be generous - call it one hour.  Are you _really_ griping
about one hour's work on your part being "very painful"?
