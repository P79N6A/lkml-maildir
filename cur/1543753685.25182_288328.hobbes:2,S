Hi Andries,
There is a user requirement for overcommit mode, you know. 
Saying "hey, there's no more overcommit mode in future v2.6 releases, you 
run out of memory and get -ENOMEM" is not really an option is it?
You propose to remove the OOM killer and do what? Lockup solid?  
It is _WAY_ off right now: look at the amount of free pages:
DMA free:4536kB min:60kB low:72kB high:88kB active:0kB inactive:0kB present:16384kB pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no

v2.4 gets it pretty much right for most cases, and its obviously screwed up right now in v2.6.
Andrea/Thomas were working on getting it fixed ??
