Hi, 
My name is Cherry, and the reason for this email is that you and I might
share something in common...At some point in our lives many of us have
contemplated or tried to start a home business. Don't worry; I'm not
trying to sell you anything. I just want to ask you a simple question?
"If I helped you start a part-time business from your home and in two
years you retired... Would you send me a Thank You card?"
If your answer is "Yes" then simply click the link below:

I would like to offer you a membership, without obligation and with no 
strings attached if you decide it is not for you. :) We are just
looking for people who still have that "burning desire" to find an 
opportunity that will reward them incredibly well, if they work at it.
I am excited about the opportunity that I have by helping other's save 
money. I love it!
If your answer is no then please delete this email, I will not be
contacting you again.
I hope you will at least take the next step and take a look. It's fun 
and there is absolutely no obligation on your part for this 
information.
Thank you for your time.

P.S. - This is a huge, ground floor opportunity that is much bigger 
than me! If you are at all interested in making some extra money or 
having a business of your own, let me know and I'll get you information
on how the business works. It is fantastic!
