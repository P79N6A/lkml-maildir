Huh.
-- cut --
primes.sh: Can't reopen pipe to command substitution (fd 4): No child processes
-- cut --
is clearly comes from bash itself.

Are you REALLY THAT dumb ? The whole idea of test was to check bash's ability
to spawn external commands. Version without them will be faster, no problem.
But with such "improvement" the whole idea of initial test is lost :-((

Greeaat optimization. If you need prime numbers. Not if you need test with lots
of process spawning. BTW if you REALLY need prime numbers then better just use
"C" and different algorith :-)

If you was unable to get the YOUR script to fail and not initial script then
you basically tested wrong thing.

OF COURSE ! When you removed the only thing which was tested test will no
longer fail fail for sure!!!
Terje: It failed to walk.
Riley: Walk is sooo slow, let change it to fly. See ? No problems anymore...
P.S. Said this I must admit that I was unable to trigger problem with initial
script and kernel 2.2.2ac5, 2.2.5ac6 and 2.2.10ac10 here (under KSI-Linux 2.1
beta) so it really does not look like kernel problem...
