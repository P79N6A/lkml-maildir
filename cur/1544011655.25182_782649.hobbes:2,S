+With PAT support, a new API pgprot_writecombine is being added. So, drivers can
 continue to use the above sequence, with either pgprot_noncached() or
 pgprot_writecombine() in step 1, followed by step 2.
 
 In addition, step 2 internally tracks the region as UC or WC in memtype
 list in order to ensure no conflicting mapping.

+Note that this set of APIs only works with IO (non RAM) regions. If driver
+wants to export a RAM region, it has to do set_memory_uc() or set_memory_wc()
 as step 0 above and also track the usage of those pages and use set_memory_wb()
 before the page is freed to free pool.
