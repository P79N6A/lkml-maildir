I've run out of time to donate to the kernel today, so I'll keep this short.

I'm going to say this one last time. If rfkill and rfkill-input aren't
manually loaded before sb and b43, not one damn thing comes out in
dmesg. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero. Bupkis. Zot. Null. The only way to
find out that those modules had to be loaded by hand was to go read
the bcm43xx-dev archives. Once those were loaded, messages came out in
dmesg pointing me to the URL for updated firmware.
I have complete current userspace as of yesterday's Ubuntu Hardy Heron
development archives.
One last thing. I've been nice to you. Please be nice to me. If you
can't manage that, then let another wireless developer take over.
You apparently think I'm an idiot. I'm not, and if necessary I could
supply a long list of credentials to prove I'm not an idiot. I'd
rather you just accepted my emails at face value and spent more effort
on trying to see how the bugs could be occurring rather than spending
effort on trying to prove that I'm an idiot.
Thanks.
