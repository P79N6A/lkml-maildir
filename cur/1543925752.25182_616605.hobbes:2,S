What I'm worred about is SMI traps implemented in the SBIOS for AHCI
workarounds that may be disabled when in IDE mode.

I believe most of the issues with sata_nv have been due to lack of
documentation of ADMA and swNCQ.  The NVIDA AHCI controllers that
operate in IDE mode are straight up PATA emulation ANSI/INCITS 370
interface, no hotplug, no NCQ.  So I would expect there to not be a lot
of issues.
I'm with you that AHCI mode is superior and should be used whenever
possible, but it probably comes as no suprise that almost all the
hardware/BIOS testing is done with Windows, and operating the hardware
in a mode that Windows doesn't (enabling AHCI in classcode 0101) seems
like asking for trouble.
