I am absolutely seeing it outside of strace.  It is showing up as an errno
to the select call:
   if (select(0, (fd_set *)0, (fd_set *)0, (fd_set *)0, &t) != 0) {
      if (errno != EINTR) {
         PyErr_SetFromErrno(PyExc_IOError);
         return -1;
      }
This code is seeing errno=514.

The production system is running CentOS 4.4, 2.6.9 kernel.  However, it
looks to be the same issue all the way up to 2.6.19.1, and google shows
reports of it on 2.6.17.
Thanks,
