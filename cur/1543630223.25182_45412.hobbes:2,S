We did some i/o profiling about 6 years ago on a big scientific
 app that had started in fortran and had been rewritten in c++ 
the fortran code used r/w on files and used temp files
the c++ did memmaps and had big data structures - taking advantage of 
memory management.
one thing I thought was interesting is that it was easy to see how a smart
algorithm, not even such a smart one, could adapt i/o to the patterns of
i/o in the fortran code, but the c++ i/o patters were really complex. 
when everything goes into the page cache, it seems like you will loose
information.
