So this is a confirmed, broken case? Why has no one complained for 2.4
and 2.6?

Might be sane, yep.

255 isn't faster than 256, measurably. But the alignment for "natural"
transfer sizes is much nicer with 256, that's the problem. You really
don't want 248 + 8 going down all the time, for instance. Perhaps it's
not a real problem, but it could be.
