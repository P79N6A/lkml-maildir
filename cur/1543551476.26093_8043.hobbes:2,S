Please, correct me if I miss anything. I got egcs-cpp-1.1.2-33mdk and
egcs-1.1.2-33mdk from rpmfind.net. After rpm -U, do:
werewolf:~/soft/dev# ls /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux/egcs-2.91.66
SYSCALLS.c.X  collect2*  crtbegin.o   crtend.o   include/  libgcc.map
cc1*          cpp*       crtbeginS.o  crtendS.o  libgcc.a  specs
Write a silly thing like "int main() {}" in kk.c and egcs breaks out
of the box:
werewolf:~> kgcc kk.c -o kk
gcc: installation problem, cannot exec `cpp0': No such file or directory
Solved by ln -s cpp cpp0. But when you try to compile kernel, the same
problem is found with a missing 'tradcpp0', that also appears if you try:
werewolf:~> kgcc -traditional kk.c -o kk
gcc: installation problem, cannot exec `tradcpp0': No such file or
directory
I tried the same trick with 'ln -s', but then 'make bzImage' stops at:
trampoline.S:47: unterminated character constant
So something is missing in rpms, or is mis-packaged in any other part of
egcs
I didn't install, such as g++ or so.
