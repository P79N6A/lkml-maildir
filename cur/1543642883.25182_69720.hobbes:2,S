Sounds good.
The difficult part is when to go from Lo to Mid. Unfortunately my tulip 
card is braindead (LC82C168), but I'll try to find something usable for 
benchmarking
In my tests with the winbond card, I've switched at a fixed packet rate:
< 2000 packets/sec: no delay
 > 2000 packets/sec: poll rx at 0.5 ms
