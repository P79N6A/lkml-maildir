Very late one night, we think :)  It was added in linux-2.4.13-pre4.

It is async.  The call will submit the IO and will return immediately.
It could block on things like memory shortage, request queue exhaustion,
but this is unlikely, and pretty much any syscall could block under these
conditions.
You should be able to poll the status of the readhead pages by mmapping
the relevant section of the file and then using mincore() to find out if
the IO has completed.

Or from the same thread.

Looks like it.  If offset is zero and count is 4097, it will only read
one page.
