Ok so that at least started to boot (i.e. I got output to the virtual
console), now my SCSI controller won't come up:  
ipr: IBM Power RAID SCSI Device Driver version: 2.0.14 (May 2, 2005)
ipr 0001:c0:01.0: Found IOA with IRQ: 337
PCI: Unable to reserve mem region #3:8000000@400b8000000 for device
0001:c0:01.0
ipr 0001:c0:01.0: Couldn't map memory range of registers
Trying to free nonexistent resource <400b8000000-400bfffffff>
I've seen it get hang right there or try to mount root fs and then
fail.  Not sure if this is a PCI issue or an IPR issue, Brian?
