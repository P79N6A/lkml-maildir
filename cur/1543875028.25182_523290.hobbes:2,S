Sorry for this mess up. You know, this is a big patch. After Arnd and
Paul's review, it took lots of time to fix their request. But I think
this update patch is the patch to satisfy Arnd and Paul's review and
they almost think this one is fine to add to -mm.

If this one is merged into -mm, I will follow the rule to send small and
fixed patches. But you know incremental patch should have a base. I hope
you can add this to -mm. And if Arnd, Paul or other kernel maintainers
find some issues, we fix them and send small patches one by one.
Thanks Andrew.
