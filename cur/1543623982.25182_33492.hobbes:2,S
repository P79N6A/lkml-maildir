That's exactly what's happening.

I don't see you need that to make this bug happen.
Say count is 0 when we enter truncate_list_pages. We increment it.
It's now 1 when we call page_cache_release. 
put_page_testzero dec's it back to 0, and returns true.
We do a __free_pages_ok. Page is still locked. BUG.
No other process, nothing funky happening, no races, no other
refcount decrements. Or that's the way I read it.

The only thing I can think of was the pagecount shouldn't have been 0
to start with (or the code path we're reading is wrong ;-) )
