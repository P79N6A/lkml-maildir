Hi Jeremy,
I applied patch #1 to tip:x86/cleanups, however, patch #2 and #3 are
identical... did you mean to do something different here?
Furthermore, please provide an actual description (and preferrably an
Impact: line) with your patches.  In particular, when unifying code that
is identical between 32 and 64 bits, please specify this in the
description (e.g. "unified functions X and Y which were already
identical between 32 and 64 bits"), so we know why there isn't a
preceeding patch to remove the remaining differences.
Thanks,
	-hpa
