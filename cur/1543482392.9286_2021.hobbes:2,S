Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I would like if people that could have problems with 2.2.0 VM could try
out my new VM:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.0_arca-1.gz
The patch includes some other things (too lazy for details now) and should
be 100% safe (really the printing could harm due new recursive semaphores 
but I'll fix that soon, and I'll change also semaphores a bit ;).
