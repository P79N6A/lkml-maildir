Just a data point from my application. First of all with VIA CPUs
there is a 1ms delay per change when it resyncs things, so it's
not practical to do it very often or for realtime apps etc.
My application was purely a heat reduction exercise where the
timescale from 0°C to 70°C was around 10 minutes at max voltage/frequency,
so it could easily be controlled by a userspace application.
In fact I didn't control it manually and only set the frequency
(for which the appropriate voltage was chosen by the cpufreq code)
at system startup.
