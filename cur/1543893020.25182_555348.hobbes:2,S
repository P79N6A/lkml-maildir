BTW, this documentation is actually wrong.  You can't enable rp_filter
on all interfaces with
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter
You must do that in conjunction with
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter
for it to work for <device>.
This is really counter-intuitive but it's apparently how it's always
worked.
Cheers,
