Well.
FHS specifies that everything needed  to boot the system should got to
/bin  and /sbin. The  base system  (build system,  etc.) should  go to
/usr. The rest should be /opt/itspackagename.
I'm not quite a FHS fan. I use libexec dirs, but I still have my build
system under /usr (and my home  under /usr/home), and the rest (X, KDE
et al) lives under /opt.
