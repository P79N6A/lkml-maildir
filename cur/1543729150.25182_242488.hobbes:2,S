 Why it's not easy? I've compiled cdrecord from source dozen times
without problems, have used it with 2.4/2.5/2.6 kernels and never
had any problem.
 My /etc/defaults/cdrecord is:
#v+
CDR_FIFOSIZE=6m
CDR_SPEED=8
CDR_DEVICE=/dev/hdc
#v-
 And works fine with my
hdc: 8X4X32, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 8192kB Cache, DMA
 It seams that people don't have problems, but they create problems
for themselves.
