Hi!
It seems to me that sharpsl.c is using some very custom units:
#define SHARPSL_CHARGE_ON_VOLT         0x99  /* 2.9V */
#define SHARPSL_CHARGE_ON_TEMP         0xe0  /* 2.9V */
#define SHARPSL_CHARGE_ON_ACIN_HIGH   0x9b  /* 6V */
#define SHARPSL_CHARGE_ON_ACIN_LOW    0x34  /* 2V */
#define SHARPSL_FATAL_ACIN_VOLT        182   /* 3.45V */
#define SHARPSL_FATAL_NOACIN_VOLT      170   /* 3.40V */
...what are they? Unfortunately collie uses very different units:
#ifdef CONFIG_SA1100_COLLIE
struct battery_thresh spitz_battery_levels_noac[] = {
        { 368, 100},
        { 358,  25},
        { 356,   5},
        {   0,   0},
...
...so it could get very confusing. Would it be feasible to convert to
mV as soon as possible and have all constants in milivolts? I realize
they may be slightly different for different models, but they should
at least be comparable.
