...and so you add latency to the ever-growing list of concepts you
publically prove to be unaware of.
Those 32 disks now have something like 32x50MB/s or 1.6GB/s, great.
Seek time is still 10ms, though, so now each seek costs as much as
16MB of continuous data transfer.  Nice.  So readahead will be 64MB,
and disk cache 1GB, just to get rid of some seeks again?  Sure.
If you were a little smarter and used the so-called RAID crap, you
would have stripes of about the readahead size (or more) and seeks get
spread up between disks.  Sure, transfer speed will usually be lower
than 1.6GB/s, but who cares.  The point is that each seek will only
cost you as much as 500kB of continuous transfer.
But like so many other things, you will refuse to understand this as
well, right?  Well, at least don't try to convince the unaware,
please.
