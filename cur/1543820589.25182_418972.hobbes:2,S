Well X has support for it, but something like the quirk in the i386
fixups is needed to make it detect the Intel PCI bridge as a
transparent one..

Well it does, as modprobing the DRM enables the device, and we store
the values in the DRM, X then goes and moves it... and the drm gets
annoyed later,
I still haven't tracked down the problem with the BIOS but I'm on its
trail now that I've fixed the PCI resource allocation..
