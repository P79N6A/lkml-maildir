...  Which means that we have allocation unit (aka UFS block) covering
several in-core pages.  Which means that if you have a file with 8Kb
hole in the beginning, mmap it shared and dirty the first couple of
pages, you will get the situation when parallel writeout on those two
pages will cause trouble.  Both times you'll allocate full block (file
is couple of megabytes long, so forget about partial blocks, relocations,
etc.)  And both will try to put the reference to what they'd allocated
into the same inode as the first direct block.  Do you see the problem?
