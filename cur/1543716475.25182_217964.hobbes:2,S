It does, and it fixes one of the dcache bugs that was tripping my debug
code.  Here are a couple more.
*   Logic bug in d_splice_alias() forgets to clear the DCACHE_DISCONNECTED
    flag when a lookup connects a disconnected dentry.  Fix is (relative
    to Neil's patch):

*   Dentry_stat.nr_unused can be be spuriously decremented when dput()
    races with __dget_unlocked().  Eventual result is nr_unused<0
    and kswapd loops.  This is the problem I mentioned earlier.  Note
    that this is not an NFS-specific problem.  Fix is:
