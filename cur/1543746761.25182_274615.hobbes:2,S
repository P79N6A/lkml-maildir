Firstly, I think there might be another race condition like the one Alan Cox 
found.  I attach a patch below with the fix for that (against 2.6.10-rc2, an 
including Alan's patch)   I'm not 100% sure its necessary, but it seems fix a 
variation I have been seeing.
With it in place, and apart from the ongoing issue - see below, I have managed 
to remove the delay in drive_is_ready() altogether without any ill effects.
[my reading of the ATA spec is that 400ns is needed after reading the status 
reg before IRQ is removed, I had wondered whether it would be better to 
record the time here and then check whether we had used up the 400ns just 
before returning from the interrupt state]

I think these two lines hold the crux of the problem.  They are the result of 
a printk in cdrom_newpc_intr just after reading the interrupt reason register 
and byte count registers.
However, I have been unable to get any closer as to why DRQ gets set.
