Alan's last version of this file included an item ``file locking needs
checking for races'' in the ``To Check'' section which apparently got lost.
However, as of test5 there are still some mostly harmless races in
flock_lock_file and mandatory file locking has a few (related)
problems:
* locks_verify_area checks the wrong range if O_APPEND is set and
  the current file position is not at the end of the file.
* dito if the file position changes between the call to locks_verify_area
  and the actual read/write (requires a shared file pointer, an attacker
  can use this to circumvent virtually any mandatory lock).
* active writes should prevent anyone from getting mandatory locks
  for the area beeing written.
* active reads should prevent anyone from getting mandatory write
  locks for the area beeing read.
   regards    Christian
