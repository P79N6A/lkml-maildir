Problem is with these pointers - reply_buf & server->packet.  Now code 
will just read packet from server->packet, and write result to 
reply_buf, most probably transmiting some random data to network, and 
overwriting innocent memory on receiption...  I believe that you need to 
make copies of server->packet/size for transmission, and some simillar 
solution for receive as well.  As both request & response can be up to 
~66000 bytes.
