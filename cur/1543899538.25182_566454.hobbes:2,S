There is a very strong reason for the kernel community to NOT support
this: it makes it much harder to deal with bug reports.
Like it or not, English is a lingua franca[1] of the technology
industry.  When I deal with the rest of the kernel community, I use
English, instead of my native language (Swedish).
For things that are targetted toward end users, that's a different
matter, of course, but kernel messages are inherently directed toward
developers and technically sophisticated users.
