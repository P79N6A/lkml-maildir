Hi there,
Just wondering if anybody has had moz hanging on them and hanging 'ps -ax'
(which means /proc/kmem reading is hung, IIRC)? This _never_ happened
before 2.4.9, and I do mozilla QA so I'd have seen it; i've seen all sorts
of crash with it :)
How can I debug this properly?
What were the changes that were reported in 2.4.9 that made mozilla
"better", exactly? I only see this happening with mozilla, but there may
be others. Let me know.
Take care,
