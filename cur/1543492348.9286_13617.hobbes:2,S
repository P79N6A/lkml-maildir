Yes this could be a true statement, but at 5-7 times the cost of an EIDE
(which is 19-23 inches long, the real problem).  The new ATA-5 Ultra/66
is still a mystery product for most, including me.
The Promise Ultra66 is not widely available nor are drives and devices.
I have found that most UDMA2 drives are shipped with cables that exceed
the spec. limits if ATA-3/4 by about one inch.  Second ATA66 will not work
without proper signalling and will fall back to ATA33 regardless of the
host adapter and the new 80 conducter ATA66 ribbon.
