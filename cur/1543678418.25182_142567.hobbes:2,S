Blame me for this! I was very busy the last few weeks, that's why I answer this
mail soooooo late. Because I have the machine now at home and no longer in a
production environment, I'm able to test everything...
(FYI. The P4 machine still runs stable. :-) ).
I'll try the latest kernel 2.4.22-pre1 on the dual-machine and tell you if it
runs stable or not. I believe there are not too much people who have a Dual-PIII
with an Adaptec controller...(!?)
However...
Keep on going!
Best regards,
 Oliver
