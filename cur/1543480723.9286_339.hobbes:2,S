	Indeed, if we were to outline the MAJOR and some minor
differences(hardware support, etc etc.) then the press people could
effectivly utilize that data and make it sound spiffy. It just sounds
crappy when some journalist who has no clue what they're talking about
starts making stuff up. I think it important to outline the major
differences so even in the event of(a contingent plan!) some dumb
journalist it doesn't wreck the whole image thing going on. 
I believe the article I read was something about iMacs and the coulumnist
said "unlink all macs before it the iMac has no boot ROM....". Now,
pulling that off would be a trick :-)
thnx.
