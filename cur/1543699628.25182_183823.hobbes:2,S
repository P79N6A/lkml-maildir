I guess I haven't proved that it was the BIOS fix, because I haven't stressed it for a long period of time.  But I don't believe I have to because I can do grep's and kernel compiles with disconnect on now, where before I couldn't (always been very easy to reproduce lockup).

Yes, thats how it was for me.. I was the only one here saying "no
problems, la la la", then at about 5.25 days.. boom. Then the next day
it crashed twice. Hopefully you make some progress with ASUS.. (for the
A7N8X Deluxe as well as you mobo please :) ).
Ive been playing with hardware in the past few days (new quieter Zalman
PSU, and Zalman 7000 Cu fan etc) so no uptime to speak of here now. I
did compile KDE 3.2 beta 2 last night though.. 6 hours of solid
compilation.. no hassles. I have never turned off Disconnect either.
Thanks to all you guys who are working on this one. Seems to be getting
somewhere.
