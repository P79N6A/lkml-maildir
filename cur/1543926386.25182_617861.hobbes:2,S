eek.
What I now need to do with this patch is
- Work out which patches in -mm it is actually fixing.
- If that is more than one patch then split this patch up into multiple ones.
- Stage the one or more fixup patches immediately after the patches which
  they are fixing (with appropriate names: foo-fix.patch fixes foo.patch)
And that's OK - it's what I do.  But if you already have some idea which
patch you're actually fixing then it really helps me if you can tell me
which one it was, please - there's no point in having me duplicate your
work.
Plus it does look like this is three patches in one (at least)...
Thanks.
