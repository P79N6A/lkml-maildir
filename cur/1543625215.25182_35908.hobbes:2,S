You scared me, so I ran the program on my AMD duron. Result are 
completely repeatable (4 runs):
   4.17: 20
  92.89: 21
   1.17: 26
   4.17: 20
  93.00: 21
   1.18: 26
   4.17: 20
  92.86: 21
   1.18: 26
   4.16: 20
  92.78: 21
   1.16: 26
Ie, rather violently different from the numbers you quoted for the 
Athlon...
