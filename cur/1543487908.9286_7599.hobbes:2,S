  The manual for the Trio64V+ is available as a PDF file.  It's one of the
files in the XFree86 development server Documentation/S3 directory.
  From what I remember (I've just been reading it this weekend),  there
is some documentation on the grabber interface (LPB section),  but I just
skimmed that bit.
  However,  at the moment the Trio64V+ driver hasn't been ported to the
4.0 driver model (hence why I've been reading the manual).
