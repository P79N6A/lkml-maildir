   c) There are numerous heuristics at work with no  RFC
   counterparts (rate halving etc etc). To have the best
   performance its probably best to stick with RFCs, or
   if there is a compelling need to have these heuristics
   then they should be brought to the IETF first.
   Implementing something based on someone's random
   publications is not a good idea for an operating as
   pervasive as Linux.
Wrong.  Half of the RFCs have flaws, and if we just would "stick to
RFCs" we'd have a lot of problems.  Most of things Linux does
different are just fixes for these errors in the RFCs.
