Subject: [PATCH 00/14] IB/mthca: merge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Here is a series of patches to the mthca Mellanox HCA driver.  Some of
the patches are largish but there shouldn't be anything too major
here.  This is mostly to bring my tree closer to the main kernel and
make the merge of direct userspace access smaller, since it will
require plenty of review.
Thanks,
  Roland
