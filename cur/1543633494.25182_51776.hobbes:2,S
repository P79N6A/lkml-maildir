This is my understanding, too.
But so how is QoS going to change things? It's the output queue of
the router on the other side of the ADLS link that needs management
(and maybe you need to speak some protocol like RSVP), or am I missing
something? How can you control the rate of *incoming* packets per
connection / protocol?
