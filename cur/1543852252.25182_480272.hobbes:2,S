The only way I see is the code review. 
Most of the drivers using save_flags()/cli() interfaces are not in use
anymore (such as drivers/char/riscom8.c). There are two possibilities:
1. Remove such drivers from kernel
2. Fix them
This would mean we can remove cli()/sti()/save_flags() interfaces from
the kernel so that any new development does not uses them accidently
