Or look at history.  I picked the two samples easiest for
me: 2.4.18 and 2.2.10.  In neither does fs/nfs/inode.c have
"flavour" in comment or symbol.  A search of the entire
kernel tree shows "flavour" only appearing in comments in
2.2.10 but 2.4.18 has some variables and macros named
"flavour" or "flavours" but they seem to be in the minority.
	$ cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.18.SuSE
	$ find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep -li 'flavour' |wc -l
	     18
	$ find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep -li 'flavor' |wc -l
	     36
Hardly scientific it lumps comments (which nobody should
care about) with variables, functions and macros, and there
will be an overlap between the two sets of files.
I'd say flavour has crept in.  While i think that "flavour"
has more panache than "flavor" i'd suggest regularising it
in the way that makes the least change.
I'm also inclined to suggest that a preferred spelling be
specified in the CodingStyle document.  Inconsistency in
this doesn't much affect readability but it does impact
maintainability.
