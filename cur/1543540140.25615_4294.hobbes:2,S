   Is path checking really a performance impact? (Most of the time, for
   finding a file by filename, you need to walk the directory tree, what
   else?)
No, most of the time you don't need to walk the directory tree.  Think
"relative pathnames".  If my current working directory is
	/usr/home/tytso/bar/win32/acl/semantics/are/really/really/really
and I open the file "stupid", I don't have to either traverse all of the
directories down to the pathname, and I don't have to do any permissions
checks in all of the parent directories of the cwd.  In NT ACL's, you do
have to check the acl's of *ALL* the parent directories, all the way up
to the root.
"Dynamic Inhertance" is a disastrous idea from a performance
perspective.  Fortunately, as near as I can tell, NFSV4 does *not*
support this.
