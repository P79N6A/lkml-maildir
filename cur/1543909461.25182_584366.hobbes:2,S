Yeah, for some reason way too many of the add-on PCI cards with
VIA chips use that pretty-broken VT6202 chip.  Ones with VT6212
are also available, and work a lot better.

Yes, IFF we know that the bug shows up in EHCI 1.00 chips rather than
just the already-known-to-be-buggy VT6202 chips.  (I think part of the
deal was that until the parts went through some conformance testing,
nobody could use the "1.0" label.  There were also a few small feature
updates and spec clarifications.  If anyone else shipped silicon in
volume that was as buggy as a VT6202, I didn't see any.)
I'd be happy to see a warning come out whenever a VT6202 is found,
since its problems are NOT limited to this I-bit bug.

Right.
