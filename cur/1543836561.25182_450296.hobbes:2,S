I understand this, but for example a UML 2.6.10 kernel will continue to run 
unmodified on top of a 2.6.17 kernel, the ABI used is stable. however if you 
have a 2.6.10 host with a 2.6.10 UML guest and want to run a 2.6.17 guest you 
may (but not nessasarily must) have to upgrade the host to 2.6.17 or later.

who is going to be writing all these interface layers to connect each kernel 
version to each hypervisor version. and please note, I am not just considering 
Xen and vmware as hypervisors, a vanilla linux kernel is the hypervisor for UML. 
so just stating that the hypervisor maintainers need to do this is implying that 
the kernel maintainers would be required to do this.
also I'm looking at the more likly case that 5 years from now you may still be 
runnint 2.6.19, but need to upgrade to hypervisor A-5.8 (to support a different 
client). you don't want to have to try and recompile the 2.6.19 kernel to keep 
useing it.

you have three hypervisors that I know of. Linux, Xen (multiple versions) , and 
VMware. each with (mostly) incompatable guests

I'm not commenting on any of the specifics of the interface calls (I trust you 
guys to make that be sane :-) I'm just responding the the idea that the 
interface actually needs to be locked down to an ABI as opposed to just 
source-level compatability.
