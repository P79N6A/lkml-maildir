I don't remember the various SLAB and SLOB and SLUB rules offhand:

.... but this would trump it: yes, we don't need 512-byte alignment
for this, and it is okay to cross a page boundary, just so long as
the start of the next page really belongs to our buffer not somebody
else's.
There doesn't seem much likelihood of anyone vmalloc'ing the buffer
in which that IDENTIFY_DEVICE gets done.  Though this discussion
does make me wonder whether ata_pio_sector ought to have a BUG_ON
(and yes, a BUG_ON rather than a WARN_ON) against the possibility.
