Did not think anyone would read code with variable-sized font. :) In 
such case the 80-rule is of little use when it comes to readability.
But do you not think there is people with small screens (and perhaps an 
increasing number with the use of PDAs and smartphones), who would like 
to change the tab-size to fit a small window (recall someone talking 
about a 62 character wide screen), where a change from 8 to 2 gains 18 
characters in just 3 levels.
In those cases, an only-used-as-indent-character is most preferable.
Of course, there is little point in patching existing tab-alignments, 
but even less creating them, which checkpatch.pl like to do sometime, 
with its "tabs not spaces".
