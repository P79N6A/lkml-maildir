Hi Andi,
It's unsigned long __fls(unsigned long)... and this is only compiled
if unsigned long is as long as u64. Seems fine to me. Moreover, it
is _exactly_ how it is done in x86_64 now. I must be missing something.

Good to know. And I realized that there is also the machines without
a hardware multiply instruction at all. So you are right. i386/x86_64
should just unconditionally set ARCH_HAS_FAST_MULTIPLIER.

That is true, of course. But then the name of the function should
give a hint that it is optimized for short sequences.
