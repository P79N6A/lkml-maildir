kerneloops.org news
* There is now a UI client so that if your kernel has an oops, you'll get asked for permission
   to submit this (rather than having to manually edit a config file as before)
* If you run the Gentoo distribution, please install the client using "emerge kerneloops"
* If you run the Fedora 8 (or rawhide) distribution, please install the rpm you can download
   from the 
http://www.kerneloops.org
 homepage
* If you run Debian unstable, please install the client via apt-get install kerneloops
