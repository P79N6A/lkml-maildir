Hi Andrew,
IA64 failed to build in kgdb with the messages
arch/ia64/kernel/kgdb.c: In function 'kgdb_arch_set_breakpoint':
arch/ia64/kernel/kgdb.c:555: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type
arch/ia64/kernel/kgdb.c: At top level:
arch/ia64/kernel/kgdb.c:673: error: static declaration of 'kgdb_hwbreak_sstep' follows non-static declaration
include/asm/kgdb.h:33: error: previous declaration of 'kgdb_hwbreak_sstep' was here
make[1]: *** [arch/ia64/kernel/kgdb.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/ia64/kernel] Error 2
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
It's buried in git-kgdb.patch and I've cc'd who might be the owner. A candidate
fix is below. The build error seems to be a simple case of a badly placed
static. The warning about large integer truncating does not have an obvious
fix and I didn't want to hide the warning with a real bug.
