I don't see that as a bug. Mine is a TerraTec DMX XFire 1024 (snd-cs46xx).
Master maps to front, Headphone to rear. PCM is the overall volume of 
digital audio (i.e. everything I can count on my fingers). Of course PCM 
is not "everything", it does not include Line Out for example. But it 
does not either on Windows (where there also is no "everything" control 
in sndvol32), so it is not a bug for me.
