Oh, it should be noted that since this is intended as a stable 2.4
series change.  The patch does not change any existing APIs, only adds a
function.  Existing 2.4 drivers are free to continue using
init_etherdev...  This bug, which I fix, isn't causing oops AFAIK, just
exporting ugliness to user space etc.
