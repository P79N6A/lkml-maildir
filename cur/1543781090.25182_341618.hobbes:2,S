Subject: [patch 05/39] remove stale comment from swapfile.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Seems like on 2.4.9.4 this comment got out of sync ;-)
I'm not completely sure on which basis we don't need any more to do as the
comment suggests, but it seems that when faulting in a second time the same
swap page,  can_share_swap_page() returns false, and we do an early COW break,
so there's no need to write-protect the page.
No idea why we don't defer the COW break.
