I thought arrogance was almost a prerequisite for being a Linux kernel
programmer?  
Seriously, if one is working on a project for which you are the highest
authority, then in your world, you are the center of your knowledge.
Any
other knowledge or view is somehow less important.  Trivializing and
marginalizing people with other views becomes standard practice.  When
you
think you know so much, you can't even begin to take on another's view
for the sake of understanding.  Instead, all you can do is tear them
down.
To even begin to try to understand takes great courage to *risk* being
wrong.  If you are identified with your work, then any questioning about
the 'standard way of doing things' is an immediate threat that is to be 
eliminated, expeditiously.  The strength of reaction is a gauge to the
arrogant person's level of fear.  
Some folks focus on the technology rather than identifying with it and
are actually
decent, reasonable people you can have a discussion with.  Others are so
full
of themselves as to label dissenters as 'dangerous' people who shouldn't
be allowed
to share their opinions.  One of the more ironic, self-evident
remarks a senior kernel contributor made: "they don't let their
ignorance get 
in the way of their opinions".  Ain't it the truth.
It's when we shut our minds that we become ignorant.
