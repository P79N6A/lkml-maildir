I can think of an application for large numbers of
terminals and a single mouse, one that I may need
to impliment for multiple sites within the year:
A NOC monitoring system for a global enterprise.
Think of shelves with a dozen monitors running 
various log and system status monitors in front of 
an operators desk. Could be done with a dozen 
computers, but it's easier to secure one machine.
Of course there would possibly be more than one
of the above in a main facility.
So yes, there are good real world reasons for being 
able to handle n monitors where n is a largish number.
