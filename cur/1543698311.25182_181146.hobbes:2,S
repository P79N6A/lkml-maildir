The docs say I shouldn't need ide-scsi anymore, but ide-scsi is the only way
I can mount cds.  If I try mount /dev/hdc /mnt I get /dev/hdc is not a valid
block device.  After loading ide-scsi, mount /dev/sr0 /mnt works fine
(though if I rip music cds with xcdroast the system locks up, ide-scsi
related oops).  This is on a hp zd7000 notebook with a dvd/cd-rw
(HL-DT-STCD-RW/DVD DRIVE GCC-4241N).
