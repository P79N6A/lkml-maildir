The file system can have two modes of operation: encrypt only,
encrypt/decrypt. In the first mode the data written is encrypted but data
read is sent as-is to the client which must take care of the decryption
process. The first mode eliminates the other possibility you mentioned of
intercepting the user's process in case when that process is running on
another machine and data is transferred encrypted. It might seem that having
a file system that only encrypts written data makes little sense, but I
think that it would have its use in situation Mike described - nobody, even
root, wouldn't be able to read anything from the FS - it would be like a
black hole. Of course, it would require an userland implementation of the FS
driver as well to read the FS data or the FS would have to be exported using
nbd, for example, and mounted on the other (secure) machine in
encrypt/decrypt mode. With the assumption that the workstation mounting the
FS is used only by authorized personnel, the entire affair is completely
secure.
