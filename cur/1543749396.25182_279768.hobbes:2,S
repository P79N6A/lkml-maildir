FYI `bcopy()` can copy overlapping buffers. It does this by
determining if the destination buffer is higher or lower than
the source buffer. If it's higher, it's an ordinary memcpy()
if it's lower, it copies backwards so that it doesn't end up
copying what was just copied, etc., the result being junk.
Both can cause page-faulting if the buffers are not in
memory. Because bcopy() has some additional starting logic,
it might be slower. Some POSIX man-pages claim that it's
deprecated and one should use memmove() instead. The Linux
man page claims one should use memcpy(), but this is wrong
because memcpy cannot successfully copy overlapping buffers.
So, if the buffers overlap, use memmove(). If not use memcpy().
This different usage might alert people who look at the code
in the future that there was some special reason for using
memmove().
