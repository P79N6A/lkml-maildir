The popping and distorting are bugs of esound, which are fixed in the
0.2.22-1 Debian package.
The hesitating, however, seems like it may be a kernel problem:
esound on 2.2.x with localhost tcp sockets, or 2.4.x with unix domain
sockets return 4096 bytes per read of a sound stream (such as that
from an mp3 player).
esound on 2.4.x with localhost tcp sockets sometimes returns 4096 bytes,
sometimes less, and sometimes stops sending data for a second or two, causing
esd to "pause" and go to sleep, and stopping all audio output.  Forcing esound
to not read any more data (with a horrible sleep(1) in the code) causes enough
data to queue up on the socket that the hesitation vanishes.  If the stream
stops and starts again (ie: switches songs in your mp3 player), the hesitation
often comes back until esound sleeps for a second again.
So my question is whether there may be a problem in localhost TCP sockets
with streams of data like this?
