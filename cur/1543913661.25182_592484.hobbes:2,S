... provided nothing relies on this relationship or the existence of
the pci_dev's sysdata. Have you audited every architecture's use of
the sysdata pointers?

Could you elaborate on why you need this? I'm assuming it's for the
per-device IOMMU page tables?

Well, you should be able to just use the pci_dev's ->sysdata (that's
what it's there for after all!) but you might need to make it point to
a structure if it's shared, the same way we did with the bus's
->sysdata. I agree that just having it point to the bus's ->sysdata is
not very useful *but* there may be code in the kernel that relies on
it (Calgary did until very recently...) so it would have to be audited
first.
Cheers,
