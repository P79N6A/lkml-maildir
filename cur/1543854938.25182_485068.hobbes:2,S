Do we need this value in the structure?  Userlevel cannot and should not 
be able to modify it.  So, userland has in any case to track the tail 
pointer itself.  Why then have this value at all?
After kevent_init() the tail pointer is implicitly assumed to be 0. 
Since the front pointer (well index) is also zero nothing is available 
for reading.
