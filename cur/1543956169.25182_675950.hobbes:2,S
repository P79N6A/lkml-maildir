We are very interested in these new operations and are moving in the 
direction of tightly integrating RDMA along with atomics (if available) 
into Oracle.  We plan on testing some early prototypes of the these in 
the few months.
Send with invalidate is an exact match for our current RDS V3 rdma 
driver - and should be more efficient than the current background 
syncing of the tpt  to ensure keys are invalidated.
We intend on exposing the atomics via the RDS driver along with simple 
low level rdma operations to Oracle's internal clients. If Oracle is 
running over a transport which exports atomics and rdma - Oracle will 
see a dramatic performance boost for several database operations.
