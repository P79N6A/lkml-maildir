I think that this makes sense. It would definitely help with designing the 
perfect scheduler. One thing tho, I wouldn't use kgdb or any other debugger, 
instead I would say that /proc or /sys interface would make more sense. 
Simply copy the weights somewhere else, dissect them, and then act 
accordingly.
