Ok. Will expand the description.

Ok. Will add this in the function description as well.

Right. I don't seem to find any suitable error from posix description.
Can you please suggest an error code which might make more sense here ?
Will -ENOTSUPP be ok ? Since we want to say here that we don't support
non-extent files.

You are right to say that the credits can not be fixed here. But, 'len'
will not directly tell us how many extents might need to be inserted and
how many block groups (if any - think about the "segment range" already
being allocated case) the allocation request might touch.
One solution I have thought is to check the buffer credits after a call to
ext4_ext_get_blocks (in the while loop) and do a journal_extend, if the
credits are falling short. Incase journal_extend fails, we call
journal_restart. This will automatically take care of how much journal
space we might need for any value of "len".

Ok. Will do that.

I agree. Will change it.

Ok. Will convert them to inline functions.
