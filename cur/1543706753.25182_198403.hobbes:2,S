Hi,
"getpcaps 1" shows, that the init-process is started without 
cap_setpcap, and i know that i can change that somehow.
So why are capabilities disabled? and how do i enable them?
If capabilities aren't still too unmature, wouldn't it be fine to have 
an option in "make menuconfig" to enable them?
My intention is to a allow a process to bind a port <1024.
The process can't be started as root.
Thx
   Sven
