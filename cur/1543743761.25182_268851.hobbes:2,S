found the bug(s), the e1000 driver disabled interrupts on
PREEMPT_REALTIME too, and the debug-message printout had a bug as well.
Found a similar problem in the tg3 driver too. Could you check out
-V0.7.15 that i've just uploaded to:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
does this work any better? [you'll still get the e100 message but that
is harmless.]
