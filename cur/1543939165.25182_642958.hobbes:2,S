The kernel from 17th Jan 2008 didn't have CONFIG_HIGHPTE enabled. Yesterday we 
checked a 2.6.23.14 kernel with CONFIG_HIGHPTE enabled. The 4GB test machine 
showed the same fast low memory reducing effect. LowFree stopped at 400MB 
like without CONFIG_HIGHPTE.  A 2GB machine had a limit of 690MB LowFree. The 
difference of LowTotal and LowFree is shown as used memory. In case of the 
4GB machine, this means I have 400MB used memory which is not related to any 
process. 
I hope this helps. I can't test on the 16GB RAM machines anymore, because they 
are working productive now.

We switched back to the distribution default 2.6.18-bigmem kernel of debian 
which doesn't have this problem. On this kernel the test script has no effect 
to the low memory.
