Yes, this is a 'compensation' for the fact that page aging changed
from exponential to linear.  The combination of linear page aging
with a large inactive_target results in a good combination of
frequency- and recency-based page eviction.
Doing just linear page aging with a small inactive target resulted
in worse throughput than exponential page aging for some workloads,
better for other workloads.  Linear page aging with a large inactive
target results in good througput and latency under all workloads I've
found up to now.  As usual, thanks go out to Matt Dillon for finding
this balancing point.
I guess it really is time to stop reinventing the wheel ;)
cheers,
Rik
