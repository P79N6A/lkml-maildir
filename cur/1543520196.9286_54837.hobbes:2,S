Hi, I was having a tour in the kernel sources and I found some codes
that I can't understand why. Like this in ppp:
int
ppp_init (struct device *dev)
{
        static int first_time = 1;   <== define to 1
        int    answer = 0;
        if (first_time) {  <== check if is 1, why ? any special special reason?
                 first_time = 0;
                answer     = ppp_first_time();
                if (answer == 0)
                        (void) register_symtab (&ppp_syms);
        }
        if (answer == 0)
                answer = -ENODEV;
        return answer;
}
I found many more codes like this in the source, I cant remeber where anymore.
