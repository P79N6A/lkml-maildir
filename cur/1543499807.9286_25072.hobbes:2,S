What you didn't write was which C library you're using, so I'll assume
glibc2.
#include <linux/if.h>
#include <linux/socket.h>
#include <linux/ip.h>
#include <linux/tcp.h>
#include <linux/if_ether.h>
If that is so, the answer is clear: never include kernel headers in
user space code and vice versa. For user space code include the
library headers instead. This would be:
#include <net/if.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/ip.h>
#include <netinet/tcp.h>
#include <netinet/if_ether.h>
