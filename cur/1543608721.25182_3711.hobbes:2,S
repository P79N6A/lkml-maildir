Ah, yes - the horrible /proc/mounts.  Check that code in 2.4.13-ac8, will
you?
Yes, current procfs sucks.  We got a decent infrastructure that allows
to write that code easily.  Again, see -ac8 and watch fs/namespace.c
code dealing with /proc/mounts.
No need to play silly buggers with "one value per file" (and invite the
Elder Ones with applications trying to use getdents()).  Sigh...
