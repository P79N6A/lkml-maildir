Oh, I finally found how to tune Mozilla and fix it:
One need to edit defaults/pref/mailnews.js file to have:
pref("mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed", false); // RFC 2646=======
pref("mailnews.display.disable_format_flowed_support", true);
This makes Mozilla to send emails w/o "format=flowed".
Thanks a lot for your patience :)
