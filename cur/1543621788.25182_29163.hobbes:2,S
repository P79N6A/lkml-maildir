If it is a matter of UUID parsing, just add (or use existing) function
uuid_parse() similar to that in libuuid.  Some UUID-related functions were
added to the kernel for ia64 GPM partitions, so this would just make the
UUID support in the kernel more complete.
Note that unless LDM has some serious brain-damage, there should not be any
need to have these special functions, as the user-space UUID-related code
works just fine without them.
Cheers, Andreas
