I would actually prefer not having the balance_dirty() in
mark_buffer_dirty() at all, and then just potentially adding an explicit
balance_dirty to strategic places. There would probably not be that many
of those strategic places.
As it stands, this is a bit too subtle for my taste, having people who
sleep without really realizing it, and not necessarily really wanting to
(not for correctness issues, but for latency issues - that superblock lock
can be quite nasty)
