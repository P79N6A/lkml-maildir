Linux 2.5.70 and above have broken ACPI.  Again.  This is my fifth
machine on which I try ACPI, two notebooks and three desktops, chipsets
from Intel, VIA and SiS, no matter, ACPI still breaks 'em all.
The symptom is that eth0 does not see the others.  /proc/interrupts has
the correct interrupt listed, so it took me a while to suspect ACPI.
agpgart also crashes, and firewire and USB didn't find any devices.
Why oh why is ACPI so horrendously broken?
And more to the point: if it _is_ this broken, why ship it at all?  I
don't recall a single moment where ACPI did anything good for me, only
crashes, data loss and general brokenness.  This may be a technology
fitting Microsoft and Intel PCs, but why give it even more leverage by
supporting it in Linux?  I say rip this abomination right out of the
kernel and be done with it.
