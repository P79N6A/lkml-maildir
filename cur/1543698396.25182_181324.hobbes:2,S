Why? I still don't get that -- we should be able to use the virtual
addressing mechanism of any CPU to swap under the rug any virtual
address without needing to do anything more than allocate a page frame
for the new physical location (I am ignoring here devices that are 
directly accessing physical memory--a callback in the device model could
be added to require them to reallocate their buffers).
Or am I deadly and naively wrong?
