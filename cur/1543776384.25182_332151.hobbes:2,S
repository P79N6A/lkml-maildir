Hello.
Reiser4 will support a special kind of regular files - so called 
cryptcompress
objects. Unfortunately this is not for product using for a while, but 
benchmarks
really show a speed gain for some conditions (if cpu is powerful, 
compression
algorithm is fast, and data is compressible).
Thanks,
Edward.
