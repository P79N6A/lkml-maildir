We can teach it two ranges. I doubt anyone will be unlucky enough to have
the one which could be either Nvidia or Gigabyte and have it matter.
The "go complain to the BIOS vendor" comment from Nvidia to me isn't an
answer. Maybe Nvidia can complain to BIOS vendors but end user complaints
of that form rarely have any effect.
