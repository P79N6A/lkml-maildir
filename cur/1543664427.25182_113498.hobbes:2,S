The DMA-API should reflect the same as the PCI-DMA API, namely:

Translated: not a physical address.  "Physical" address to me means
the address that appears on the outside of the CPU after it has passed
through the MMU and is heading for the local CPUs system RAM.
So yes, I think this is a bug that exists in the DMA-API document.
It must be an offsetable cookie that the card on its own bus knows how
to deal with to access the memory associated with the mapping.  In plain
speak, the bus address for that device.

You can do this today with the API - test dev->bus_type to determine
the type of the bus, convert to the correct device type and grab the
bus information.
The API hasn't really changed - its just that bugs exist in the
documentation that need fixing before 2.6 comes out.  Submit a
patch. 8)
