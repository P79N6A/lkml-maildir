Subject: natsemi trouble with netgear fa311 in 2.4.6

I have a NetGear FA311 pci card that uses the natsemi.c driver and have 
had no
problems with it in all kernels 2.4.0 through 2.4.5.  However with 2.4.6 
(also
tried 2.4.6-ac2) I am getting strange behavior.  As soon as an ip is 
given to it
(with either dhcp or manual ip) this error message keeps repeating:
eth0:  Something Wicked happened! 18000
and I can't ping anything else except itself.  It's always 18000.  I've 
tried
switching the card to another pci slot, checked the cables, etc.  When I 
switch back
to kernel 2.4.5 everything works perfectly.
The bootup message is:  eth0: Setting full-duplex based on negotiated link
capability.
And lspci shows:  Ethernet controller: National Semiconductor 
Corporation: Unknown
device 0020
The computer is a k6-2 400 with an ASUS P5A motherboard (ALi chipset)
