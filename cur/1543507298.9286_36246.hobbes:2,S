I found modules not loading in spite of being well compatible with the
kernel. Maybe the mechanism works better, now, I didn't check. Do they?
That's why I'd like SMP being stored in the kernel version for the modules
and for the kernel, just like an extraversion. Easy and functional, also
without MODVERSIONS.
