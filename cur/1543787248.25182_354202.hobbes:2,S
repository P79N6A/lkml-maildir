Yes it can.  Apparently on my box the call to request_irq() from a USB HCD
driver (OHCI or EHCI) causes a screaming interrupt to be generated,
which kills any other driver that shares the IRQ with the USB and has not
called free_irq() on suspend.  Of course this only happens with the patch
at 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0507.3/2234.html
unapplied, as it masks the problem.  Actually it also depends on the
order in which the drivers' resume routines are called, but unfortunately
on my box the USB drivers' are called first.
Still, if _none_ of the drivers (including USB HCD) calls request_irq() on resume,
the box survives _even_ _without_ the above-mentioned patch.

AFAICT, in this particular case it doesn't matter.
