Subject: [BK PATCH] Yet more PCI fixes for 2.5.73
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's some more PCI fixes that are against the latest 2.5.73 bk tree.
They fix up the kobject bug in the pci hotplug drivers (the core was
fixed in the patches sent yesterday), and change the pci_dev's slot_name
to be a pointer to the struct device's bus_id.  This provides us with
the unique name needed for pci domain support.  There's also a bugfix
for the pci direct code in i386.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
