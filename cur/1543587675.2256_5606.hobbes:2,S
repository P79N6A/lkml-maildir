Updated my glibc; -ac7 now still won't compile with
gcc-3.0-pre-2001-04-08.
I will test with today's or tomorrow's gcc-snapshot when I'll get the
time but
I'm at work at the moment and this does cope more than "just the
kernel".
But we _do need_ a working current-kernel.
Second: ASUS A7PRO, Duron-700 - any problems reported at the moment?
