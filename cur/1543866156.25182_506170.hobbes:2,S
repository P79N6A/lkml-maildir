Hello,
Before some time I decided to fix suspend/resume on my Davicom network card.
During development I also fixed couple of bugs and added support for link detection and WOL
Note : 2.6.20 already has support for link detection , but it is broken when card has external PHY
, like mine.
So here it goes:
[PATCH] [NET] [001] dmfe : trivial/spelling fixes
[PATCH] [NET] [002] dmfe : Fix possible oops
[PATCH] [NET] [003] dmfe : fix link detection
[PATCH] [NET] [004] dmfe : Add suspend/resume support
[PATCH] [NET] [005] dmfe : Add support for wake-on-lan
