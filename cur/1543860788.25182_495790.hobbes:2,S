Why would the min_nr = 3 sleeper be woken up in that case?  Only 2  
ios were issued.
Maybe the app was relying on the min_nr = 2 completion to issue 3  
more ios for the min_nr = 3 sleeper, who knows.

Yeah, don't misunderstand me -- we agree that the current situation  
is bad.

I only gave 2 ios/events in that example.
Does that clear up the confusion?
