Subject: ACPI processor C-state regression in 2.6.13-rc3?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

With the ACPI merge in 2.6.13-rc3, C2 and C3 processor states are no
longer detected/enabled on my Fujitsu Lifebook P7010D. Enabling ACPI
debugging doesn't result in any extra info about this being reported.
I assume it's related to the changes to enable C2/3 on SMP..
Please CC me with any followups, as I'm not on the list.
