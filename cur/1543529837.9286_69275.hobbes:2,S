 I don't have a problem with the pcmcia or physical interface, but I do
suspect the FAT12 filesystem.  I used 'dd' to copy the entire flash into
a file so I could try mounting it via the loopback device.  If I force
FAT12 options, it get a message regarding invalid superblock.
 My real question is: who maintains the FAT fs drivers, and would they
be willing to try reading this file so I can find out if the linux or
camera FAT fs system is the source of the problem.
 I've not dug into the FAT directory structure in many, many years, and
maybe someone else could quickly spot a problem that might take me a
week to muddle through...
 Thanks-
ron
