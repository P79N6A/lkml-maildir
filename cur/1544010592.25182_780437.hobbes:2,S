By module, do you mean software or hardware?  I have to assume you mean
software as this is a laptop.  But I don't know what other module I
could use.  The graphics chip is a:
00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960
Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
Maybe I'm just completely mis-understanding you.
BTW, FWIW, this problem happens without an X server even.  Just plain
console driver.
