How about I just kill it now, so that it just doesn't exist, and the dust 
(from all the other things) can settle where it will?
In fact, I think I will remove the whole "rwlock_is_locked()" thing and 
the only user, since it's all clearly broken, and regardless of what we do 
it will be something else. That will at least fix the current problem, and 
only leave us doing too many bus accesses when BKL_PREEMPT is enabled.
