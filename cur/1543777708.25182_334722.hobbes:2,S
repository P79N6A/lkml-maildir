It just looks like a complicated way to do an ioctl, a control file that 
you can read/write would be a lot simpler and faster.

If a lot of clients needs this, there a different ways to do this, e.g. by 
introducing some helper functions that clients can use. This way you can 
keep the core simple and allow the client to modify its behaviour.

I mean, relayfs doesn't has to know about this, the client itself can do 
it (e.g. via helper functions).
