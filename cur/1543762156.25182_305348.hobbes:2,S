Hi Andrew,
I've tried 2.6.12-rc1-mm1 today and it stops booting at the same point as 
2.6.11-mm4. What might help is the info that rc1 boots just fine so it is 
something in the mm series that impedes the boot process. However, sysrq-P 
and sysrq-T do not provide anything - sysrq doesn't show any activity at all, 
i.e. it doesn't even print the usage info message. Infact, the keyboard is 
dead, it doesn't even turn on or off any lights (NumLock etc).
Any ideas? (Additional printk's added manually, etc..)
Regards,
Boris.
