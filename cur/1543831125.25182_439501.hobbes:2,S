Unfortunately, I haven't looked at XFS delalloc implementation indetail
to understand what exact they would need from VFS (or could be pushed to
VFS). I purely tried to work with current ext3 code and current VFS
support. What I find is that -
1) Instead of allocating a block at prepare time, we need to be able to
"reserve" a block (so it won't file as part of writeback). And, as 
part of writeback - we need a way to figure out if a given page did
indeed really reserve the block. (we need to make sure the allocation
succeeds for those). We might need a pageflag for this (but I haven't
decided that its absolutely needed).
2) Needed a way to cluster bunch of (contig) pages and allocate disk
blocksfor those in a single shot - which is NOT a direct delalloc
requirement, but that is the whole reason for doing delalloc. 
(Suprana did few radix_tree interfaces for this).
Other than these general VFS level ones - I had to play with journal
lock ordering issues (very specific to ext3 stuff). To work around
the journalling issues, I had to do my own mpage_writepages() since 
the changes I need are specific to ext3 journalling - I am not sure
if they are going to be useful for other filesystems or not.
If you can think of general infrastructure you need for OCFS2, please
let me know - we can come with commonality.
Thanks,
Badari
