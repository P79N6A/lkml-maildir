I went nuts with printk statements and managed to isolate the hang to
one particular line of code.  The final printk in this code fragment
never gets executed.  
                } else if (m5229_revision >= 0xC3) {
		        /*
                         * 1553/1535 (m1533, 0x79, bit 1)
                         */
                        printk("ata66_ali15x3           } else if (m5229_revisi\on >= 0xC3) {\n");
                        pci_write_config_byte(isa_dev, 0x79, tmpbyte | 0x02);
                }
                printk("ata66_ali15x3 endif\n");
Art, Dave, and Ben may or may not have the same problem.  It would be
interesting to know if they get a hang here.
Any ideas for fixing?
