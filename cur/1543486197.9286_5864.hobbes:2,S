Do you mean the '-taso', '-xtaso', and '-xtaso_short' flags to DEC's
cc? Those are largely intended to make it easier to port broken
programs which assume that all the world's a 32-bit machine to
Alphas. 64-bit-unclean code is annoyingly common, so that's a handy
flag to have.
According to the DEC cc manpage:
  -taso
      Tell the linker that the executable file should be loaded in the
      lower 31-bit addressable virtual address range. The -T and -D
      flags to the ld command can also be used to ensure that the text
      and data segments addresses, respectively, are loaded into low
      memory.
      The -taso flag, however, in addition to setting default
      addresses for text and data segments, also causes shared
      libraries linked outside the 31-bit address space to be
      appropriately relocated by the loader. If you specify -taso and
      also specify text and data segment addresses with -T and -D,
      those addresses override the -taso default addresses. The -taso
      flag is useful for porting 32-bit programs to DEC OSF/1.

  -xtaso
      Cause the compiler to respond to the #pragma pointer_size
      preprocessor directives which control pointer size allocations.
      This flag allows you to specify 32-bit pointers when used in
      conjunction with the pragma pointer_size directive. You must
      place pragmas where appropriate in your program to use 32-bit
      pointers. Images built with this flag must be linked with the
      -taso flag in order to run correctly. See the Programmer's Guide
      for information on #pragma pointer_size.
  -xtaso_short
      Force the compiler to allocate 32-bit pointers by default. You
      can still use 64-bit pointers, but only by the use of pragmas.
