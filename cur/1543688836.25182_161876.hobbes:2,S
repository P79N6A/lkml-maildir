Thanks all of you for helping me to resole the problem of "ctrl+c disable".
and now, the problem has been resolved.At the very start,when the system start,it give the user a shell prompt directly,at this instance,the "ctrl+c" disable. Afterward,I change the file of "/etc/inittab" as this:"s1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0 vt100",then the problem is resolved.Maybe this is a apish a mistake.
:-)
thanks
Bill
