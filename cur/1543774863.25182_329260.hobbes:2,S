The most obvious (at least obvious for me) complaint about this is that
the attributes are separate from the file.  (In other words, it's a bit
ugly. ;-) ) So if you want to backup a file, along with all its
(extended) attributes (or substreams, or ... etc. ...), you need to
backup the file, and find the appropriate /attr/fs/$DEV_NUM/$INODE_NUM
and back that up.  If I want to edit an attribute, I need to find
$DEV_NUM and $INODE_NUM (which I have no idea how to do), rather than
just "edit foo/.../extended_attribute".  (Or using your "getattrpath"
command, it would be a two-step process -- run getattrpath, then run
editor -- rather than a one-step process.  Of course, this is only
mildly annoying.)
It also exposes a difference between attributes and regular files.
e.g. can I add attributes to an attribute?  (say, I have a thumbnail
attribute for the file ~/foo, and I want to add a mime-type attribute to
that thumbnail attribute.)  If you want to allow it, you have to be
careful not to run into a big loop generating an infinite number of
inodes in the attrfs. (e.g.
/attr/fs/$(getattrpath /attr/fs/$(getattrpath ~/foo)/thumbnail)/mimetype
-- attrfs shouldn't generate the inode for that until
/attr/fs/$(getattrpath~/foo)/thumbnail is accessed, and maybe not even
then...)
That said, I prefer that interface over xattr or openat.

The advantage of using inodes rather than pathnames is that it is robust
with respect to file renaming/moving.  It also allows things like
adding attributes to symlinks (since the inode number for a symlink is
different from the inode number for the file that it points to).
You can still symlink.  It just takes a little more effort to figure out
what $DEV_NUM/$INODE_NUM to use.

For the mount point, it doesn't matter; it's up to the user.  It's the
attrfs or metafs or ???fs that matters (but which will greatly influence
whether people user /attr or /meta).
