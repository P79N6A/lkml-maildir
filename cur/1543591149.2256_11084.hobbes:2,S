Don't think so.  We have exclusion against all netdevice ioctls
across probe.  Still.  It doesn't matter.

Once init_etherdev() has gone, yes, dev_probe_lock() can go.

asmlinkage long sys_ioctl(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
{       
        struct file * filp;
        unsigned int flag;
        int on, error = -EBADF;
        filp = fget(fd);
        if (!filp)
                goto out;
        error = 0;
        lock_kernel();
The CPU running ifconfig spins here.

It doesn't matter...  I think we agree that init_etherdev() must
die, and dev_probe_lock() with it, and that Jeff's alloc_etherdev()
is an appropriate way of doing it?
Actually, yes.  Please tell me what problem you think we
still have in current kernels, which dev_probe_lock()
does not prevent?
