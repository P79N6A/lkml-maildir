  Yep, that was me. I couldn't really find a better way to do it at
  the time. An 'execve shutdown' probably would have been better in retrospect
  because I think sending SIGPWR to init doesn't always shutdown the machine.
  It depends on how some config files are setup (inittab, powerfail).
  I'd rather not depend on any config files and just force a shutdown/poweroff.

 Testing should be easy - on a Deskside Prism system, just hit the
 power button while up at Linux.
