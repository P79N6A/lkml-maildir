Why not just copy over relevant files to scripts/kconfig?
Then no playing tricks with libaries etc. is needed, and everythings
just works.
It is only 8 files and prefixing them with lx* would make them
stand out compared to the rest. It is not like there is any user planned
for the lxdialog functionality in the kernel, and kconfig users outside
the kernel I beleive copy lxdialog with rest of kconfig files.
Btw. the work you are doing are clashing with a general cleanup effort
of lxdialog I have in -mm at the moment.
I received only very limited feedback = looks ok.
Integrating principles from your old patch was on my TODO list.
I have something in the works that uses linked list instead of a
preallocated array, to keep the dynamic behaviour. I will probarly make
a version with the linked list approach but otherwise use your changes
to mconf.c. But it will take a few days until I get to it.
