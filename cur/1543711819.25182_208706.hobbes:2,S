Maybe we should start ditching OSS drivers of cards that are known to work
"reasonably well" in ALSA. If someone starts screaming "I need OSS for the
ALSA driver contains a bug", that bug might even be located and dealt with
much sooner. The ALSA OSS emulation is good enough for user land
applications to survive I think, so it's just a matter of driver bugs.
This way we end with a list of OSS drivers that are not ported yet or that
never will be ported.
OTOH, I don't know how the big bosses here think about ditching OSS
from a stable kernel tree... Can imagine they think it is not done.
