fyi, loop devices over lvm LV's dont work for me...
I've tested with 2.4.3final (and some other 2.4.3 derivates) and two
lvm'ized partitions with a size of about 1gig each; mke2fs
just goes into D-state and stays there when applying it to /dev/loop0,
running it directly on the LV-device works...
greetings,
