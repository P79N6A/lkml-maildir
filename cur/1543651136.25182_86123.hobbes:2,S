We did put your fixes in, if they don't work, let me know.

Absolutely not.  I would expect most people to not use it, and I
would hope that most distributions would build it as a module but
not turn it on (unless they really wanted it on by default).

It's neither here nor there anymore.  I think if companies like
Red Hat don't want it turned on, that's fine, but they should at
least allow their customers to have it available to them for
use, if that's what they want.
Of course, I'm not going to go through all the reasons why there's
a major disconnect between Linux distributions and hardware vendors,
but suffice it to say that's the root of the problem here.
