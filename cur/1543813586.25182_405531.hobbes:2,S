Hello everyone!
My name is Moweon Lee from South Korean.
Our team made a new file system which is named by Namsan 
filesystem(Actually it is the name of mountain in Korea and hard to climb.).
Now I'm trying to make bad block management system in that file system.
But I'm not sure about this.
Let me ask you one thing.
When the HDD's sector remapping occurs?
Especially when HDD controller find sector errors in writing phase,
, is it automatically remapped by HDD ? (without notifying it for kernel)
I wanna know it because I have to make some treatment about every sector 
error.
bye~~
