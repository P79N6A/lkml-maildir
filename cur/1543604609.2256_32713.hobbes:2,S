Check the archives.  Apparently there is an issue with the highly optimized
Athlon specific memory access/clearing routines that leads to instability on
some motherboards/BIOS revisions.
There is a fix available that seems to clear this up, but it hasn't made it into
the mainstream kernel yet.
The only real difference between Athlon and PIII kernels are some
Athlon-specific optimized assembly-code.  The PIII versions still run, just not
quite as fast.
