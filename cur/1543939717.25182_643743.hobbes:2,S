Hi,
The 2.6.24-git2 kernel build fails on the power boxes with following build failure
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `fphalf':
arch/powerpc/kernel/vector.S:(.toc+0x1428): undefined reference to `devices_subsys'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
This built-failure was seen in the mm broken-out-2007-11-06-02-32, I have tested 
the patch posted to lkml at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/208
 fixes this issue.
