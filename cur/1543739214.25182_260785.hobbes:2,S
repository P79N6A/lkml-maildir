the latency tracer is pretty specialized for a number of reasons, i'm
not sure there's a good match between the two. If relayfs were in the
mainline kernel i'd consider reusing parts of it.

this still does not solve all problems related to irq entries: if the
IRQ interrups the tracing code after a 'successful reserve' but before
the 'else write' point, and the trace is printed/saved from an
interrupt, then there will be an incomplete entry in the trace.
also, there is the problem of timestamp atomicity: if an IRQ interrupts
the tracing code and the trace timestamp is taken in the 'else' branch
then a time-reversal situation can occur: the entry will have a
timestamp _larger_ than the IRQ trace-entries. With cli/sti all tracing
entries occur atomically: either fully or not at all.

it would have to do that on PREEMPT_REALTIME. The irq flag solves both
the races, the predictability problem and the preemption problem nicely.
