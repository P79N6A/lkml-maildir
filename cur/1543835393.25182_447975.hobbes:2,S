PAE is what allows an OS in 32-bit mode to access memory located above 
4GB in the address space. On a 64-bit OS the CPU can access all the 
memory directly so PAE is not needed or possible. Also, PAE is often 
enabled on 32-bit systems even with less than 4GB of RAM as it allows 
using the hardware NX bit, which was only added to the PAE versions of 
the 32-bit page tables.
That's a separate issue, though, from the original subject of the thread 
(memory being mapped over by IO space), and from the artificial limit on 
accessing memory above 4GB in at least 32-bit consumer Windows.

I don't think most S754 boards support physically installing that much 
RAM, so it may be moot. If you could, you could likely access memory 
above 4GB, though I'm not certain if the S754 CPUs support the memory 
hole remapping to avoid some of that RAM being lost.

Yeah, there is not much point in installing more than 3GB in such a board..
