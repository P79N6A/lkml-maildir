Sorry if this is a stupid question, but have you heard about 64K-aliasing ?
We have seen it in P3/P4, do not know if Athlons also suffer it.
In short, x86 is crap. It slows like a dog when accessing two memory
positions sparated by 2^n (address decoder has two 16 bits adders, instead
of 1 32 bits..., cache is 16 bit tagged, etc...)
