Do you use any unusual (binary only/with source) kernel modules?
mmx.c stores the current contents on the fpu registers into
current->thread.i387.f{,x}save.
If another module modifes the fpu registers and calls memmove it will
cause fpu corruptions.
I checked that a few months ago, and no module in the main kernel tree
does that.
