Even if you did it wouldn't work right now.  My initial
version does initialize the ehci properly so it won't
find any usb devices.  I almost have that fixed,
but it looks like for the usb device reset I need
a usable delay function, so I can delay 50ms.  Grr...

Yep thanks that seems to be working.  Now I just need
to find an early delay and I can try this mess out!
