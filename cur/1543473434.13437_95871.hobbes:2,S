There are a few documents concerning the Linux kernel that
are online -- you can find them on the Linux-MM home page
at 
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/.
As for good starting points inside the kernel source, I think
that kernel/sched.c and fs/exec.c are good places because the
code in there is at the very centre of what is happening and
yet everything in those files is done with enough abstraction
not to confuse a newbie...
