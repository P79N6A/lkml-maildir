Just a quick me-too on 2.4.21-pre3-ac3, it's better than -ac2, which
seems to have randomly locked up at times and then I ended up losing a
bunch of binaries in /usr/bin/... for some reason.  Plus some /dev
entries as well.
It's amazing what breaks in X when random parts like /dev/tty7 and
stuff in /usr/bin are gone, and it's *very* un-enlightening what the
problem is.
