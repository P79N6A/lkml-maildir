AFAIKS it does.
Failed lockers will go through to __mutex_lock_nonatomic, which calls
__mutex_lock_common to queue it on the tail of the FIFO list race-free.
__mutex_lock_nonatomic then sleeps, waiting for the task to become head
of the list and be worken up.
__mutex_lock_nonatomic then removes this task from the FIFO and calls
__mutex_lock_common again.
If I read right, not only is it a fairness problem, but it could also
harm performance because it will cycle through all waiting tasks rather
than just the next one to go.
If I don't read right... can you explain how it works? :P
