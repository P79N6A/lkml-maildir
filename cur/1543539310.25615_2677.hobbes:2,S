I made a little change to my patch, now I can use 
my diskless EB164 with X on linux-2.4.0-test4 with my patch.
See

Initial allocation of the fortran code was assigned by brk,
I missed to turn on the brk support for the previous benchmark.
Now fortran code also run faster, see the fortran benchmark code
on the WEB. Matrix transpose was about 50% faster than the normal kernel.
Enjoy,
