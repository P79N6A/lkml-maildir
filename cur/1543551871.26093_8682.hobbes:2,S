CD Recording seems to work correctly under 2.4.0-test10-pre3.  I'm using
cdrecord 1.9 with a Phillips CDD3610.  However, playing back an audio cd
using cdp gives the following error:
sr0: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.                                                                                  
CDROMPLAYTRKIND: Operation not supported
There may have been a patch posted on the kernel list for this.  As I'm
having trouble accessing the archives at the moment I'm unable to test
it.
