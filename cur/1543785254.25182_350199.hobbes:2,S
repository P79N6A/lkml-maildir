Hi,
	Is Linus git tree the one used for the rc's and the final release?
I keep updating and it still says 2.6.13 instead of 2.6.14-rc1. I don't
really care if that is cosmetic, is fine, I just want to make sure that
I'm up to date?
Again, this is what I do:
cd linux-2.6
git pull
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
git checkout
? Anyone
.Alejandro
PS: Thanks for kicking in HDAPS into this tree.
