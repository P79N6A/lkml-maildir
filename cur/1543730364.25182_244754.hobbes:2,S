Hi,
Need help in mouting two-LUN atapi flash card reader. 
Linux Distribution - Redhat 8.0
Kernal version - 2.4.18-14
Details about the device attempting to mount:
1.  The device used for mounting is a Atap flash card reader and it is not
an USB device.  It uses 40-PIN ide connector and cable. It is connected as
secondary master to the linux system.
2.  Size of the device matches to that off floppy drive.  It has one
connector for CompactFlash --- for LUN0  and second connector for
SmartMedia/MMC/MS --- for LUN1.
Appreciate your help.
With best regards
Karthi
With best regards,
