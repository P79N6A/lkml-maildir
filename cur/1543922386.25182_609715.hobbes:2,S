True.  Perhaps sg_phys() should use its own sg_phys_addr_t, defined
or typedefed to be the same as dma_addr_t.  But would this inline
function then be the only place in the tree which uses that type?
If so, then it'd probably be better just to let sg_phys() carry on
using dma_addr_t, but insert a comment there to make your point.
But I'll leave it to Jens to fix up the patch appropriately: for
all I know, there might be arches on which using dma_addr_t there
actually does the wrong thing - I don't think so, but I know too
little about it.
