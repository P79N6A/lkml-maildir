How do I know which program header is real mode code and the boot loader
is not supposed to load it? May be PT_LOAD header with physical addr 0?
What happens if changes happen and down the line we start compiling 
real mode code for non-zero address? Hence I think keeping real mode
code out of vmlinux might prove to be a good idea.
Secondly, if you compile real mode code with vmlinux, what would be the
entry point for this ELF file? Real mode entry? Then I have not way to
find out from ELF headers where is the protected mode entry point and
I can not do use this vmlinux with kexec/kdump. 
OTOH, now bzImage is relocatable. Is this image going to be relocatable?
How do we take care of that?
Thanks
Vivek
