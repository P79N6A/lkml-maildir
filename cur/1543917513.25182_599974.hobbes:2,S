Which has been known to result in the string getting written out to the .o 
file even if it's never used, just in case something tries to take its 
address.  This is not the same as a #define.

Not with -D on the command line though.  Your #define would have to come after 
the declaration or else the declaration turns into 'char *"fred" = "george";' 
and you have a syntax error.  Again, not synonymous with a #define...
