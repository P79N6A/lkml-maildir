Ripping out the current code and having useful default behaviour are
hopefully not mutually exclusive.

But you don't have to use modules at all, while running without
interrupts isn't an option.

Perhaps I misread Linus' recent post about not breaking things to the
user, and I know he was talking about executables in particular, but if
this new code is so great, why can't it start with some default values
which will be no worse than what we have? Because there will be people
who haven't installed the latest userspace int-diddler.
Deliberately making the initial tuning useless to promote use of the
user space software seems counter productive. There will be many users
who will find a way to make a tuned kernel worse than any default, so if
the default is usable it will avoid people shooting themselves in the
foot. Can you imagine someone leaving an interrupt unserviced at all? If
there's a way someone will :-(
I'm not defending the existing code, just speaking for the idea of
leaving something useful in its place.

As long as it's something sane, it doesn't have to be optimal. If SuSE
used it, it's likely to be good enough.

I may be misreading the intent in David's messages, as long as the
default is useful it certainly doesn't have to be what is in place now.
Of couse it would be useful to actually see some numbers, just because
existing code is somewhat ugly, confusing, and ill-justified and the new
is a pretty algorithm with great flexibility, does not mean that the
actual benchmarks will reflect better performance.
