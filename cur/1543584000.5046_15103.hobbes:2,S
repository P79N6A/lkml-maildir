Subject: Problems with gdb and latest kernels (SIG32)

        Hello,
        I'm trying to debug some multithreaded apps, I'm using gdb-5.0 and
glibc-2.2.2. GDB works without problems for non-threaded apps, but whenever
I try to debug a threaded one I got "SIG32, Real-time event 32" instead of
the signal that would tell gdb that a new threaded is created. Anybody has
also experiment this? Is this a GDB bug? a GLibc bug? or a kernel related
problem? (kernel has NO bugs :-)
        I'm using 2.4.2-ac13, but it also happens with 2.4.2, and later,
doesn't check with previous kernels.
        Regards,
