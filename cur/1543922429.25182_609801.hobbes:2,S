Not really.
But when we touch Kconfig.debug we should check up on that it reflect
reality. I would be suprised if we do not miss an option or two.
I am tempted to just go forward with the version Randy made where
he merged the two.
If I get time I will look at it tonight and send out a series of patches
for review.
We have to get rid of the directories - just consider the poor victim
that has her/his code reviewed by hch after he have had his nightmare ;-)
