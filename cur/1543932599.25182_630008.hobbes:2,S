Hmmm... It will unconditionally enable interrupts regardless how we call 
this. We could explicity save and restore interrrupts in 
swsusp_save() I guess. Why is swsusp_save() disabling interrupts?

We could reexport drain_local_pages() again but then I do not understand 
why we would only drain the pages of this processor and not of all other
processors as well. It seems that software suspend intend was to flush 
them all right?
