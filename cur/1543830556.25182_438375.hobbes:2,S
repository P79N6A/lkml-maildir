Don't bet on that. There are a considerable number of crash stall cases
where NMI will not be delivered, plus you can disable NMI if you are
really sneaky and want to.
The usual case NMI fails is crashed video cards. The PCI transaction
stalls forever on many boards and the CPU therefore never finishes the
instruction and never services the NMI
