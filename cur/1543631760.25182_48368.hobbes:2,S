How about something more useful: interval progress assurances? Such as
"during any 5  second  period this process will be able to read X meg of
data from a file and write Y meg"
So if I have an RT task that dumps data to a DVD at millisecond intervals,
I can be sure that the non-RT task that reads the FS and puts data 
into a buffer will never let me run out of frames on a given shared memory
size.
This is useful in itself for nonRT Linux too. It seems quite hard, but it
could be relatively robust, once it was in place - making a 1 millisecond
worst case turn into a 10 millisecond worst case would not break it.

BTW:
I'm ignoring the 10 billionth rehash of the RTLinux/RTAI debate since 
there seems very little purpose in not doing so.  People who have actual 
questions should feel free to ask me directly - publically or privately, I
don't mind. Those on tape loops can keep repeating themselves without
my assistance.
