Then "beyond" is already covered :)

Almost no-one in the kernel should be directly accessing pci config
space without having a pci_bus structure at the minimum.  The exceptions
are the pci core, and the pci hotplug code.  Now, if we move the
majority of the pci hotplug resource code into the pci core, then only
one place would need it.  Then there would not be a need to have these
types of functions exported at all.  ACPI is a arch specific way of
setting up the pci space, so it too needs to be able to do this a little
bit (not a lot, like it currently does.)
So yes, it is cruel to not have this ability, but it is cruel for a
reason :)

Ok, mind trying to make up a patch for 2.4 that does this to see how
feasible it really is?
