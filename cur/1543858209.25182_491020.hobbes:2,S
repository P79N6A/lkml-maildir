This issue is not related to DMA: there are 2 different virtual
addresses that can map the same physical address. If these 2 virtual
addresses use 2 different data cache entries then you have a cache
aliasing issue. In your case the 2 different virtual addresses are (1)
the one got by the kernel (returned by vmalloc) (2) the one got by the
application (returned by mmap).
Hope that helps.
