Well maybe that's his problem and maybe it isn't, but he's not the only 
person thinking that there's something strange about devfs in 2.4.20. I 
have a 2.4.20-SMP box that is deadlocking when loading modules via 
devfs. The NMI watchdog has produced two oopsen for me, which I have 
published to this list, and while one oops is also from the ALSA 
modules, the other is from mga.o. Both oopsen occur in the 
__write_lock_failed() function and have devfs_open() in the module 
stack. I have most definitely NOT forgotten to recompile everything for 
2.4.20, and I am using symbol versioning anyway.
