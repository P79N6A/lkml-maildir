An out-of-line implementation can only do that if the architecture
allows unaligned loads and stores. Since it has no clue about the types
involved, it must assume that both pointers as well as the length may be
misaligned.
gcc, on the other hand, knows exactly what types are involved, so when
it expands its own builtin-memcpy inline it can optimize it based on
the required alignment of those types. So when you cast between types
with different alignment requirements, you must make sure the result is
properly aligned, or you need to use get_unaligned()/put_unaligned()
to override gcc's assumptions.
Btw, some versions of avr32-gcc (I think it was 4.0.x) assumed packed
structs were properly aligned too, with disastrous results. gcc-4.1
handles packed structs correctly as far as I can tell.
