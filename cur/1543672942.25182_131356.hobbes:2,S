Hi Derrick,

I suppose I can do that... I can add a hook to the security framework or add a
an extra capability to allow a finer degree of control.
Perhaps:
	newpag()	<--- new PAG
	setpag(0)	<--- no PAG
	setpag(>0)	<--- join PAG if permitted

Getting the per-user PAG data from the current process becomes a little
trickier when worker kernel threads become involved:-/
Maybe each user_struct should _also_ have a normal PAG associated with
it. Asking for "no PAG" joins the calling process into its owner user's
PAG. Then you only need one number space...
However, doing this would affect authentication tokens for every FS that
stored them in this way, not just AFS (Samba for instance).

I take it that "prefetch" means try and fetch the entire file into the cache?
