I'd prefer to be a guinea pig for one of 3 or 4 generic kernels distributed
in binary than of one of the hundreds of possibilities of patching a kernel
together at boot, plus the (presumamby rather complex and fragile)
machinery to do so *before* the kernel is booted, thank you very much.
Plus I'm getting pissed off by how long a boot takes as it stands today...

Easy: i386. Or i486 (I very much doubt your customers run on less, and this
should be geneic enough).
