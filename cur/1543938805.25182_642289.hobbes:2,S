FYI :
kernel/panic.c
NORET_TYPE void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
{
....
bust_spinlocks(1);
...
bust_spinlocks(0);
...
In bust_spinlocks :
void __attribute__((weak)) bust_spinlocks(int yes)
{
        if (yes) {
                ++oops_in_progress;
        } else {
#ifdef CONFIG_VT
                unblank_screen();
#endif
                if (--oops_in_progress == 0)
                        wake_up_klogd();
        }
}
Where the final wake_up happens while oops_in_progress is 0, but
interrupts are still disabled.
So about my previous email, proposing testing oops_in_progress, it just
won't work.
