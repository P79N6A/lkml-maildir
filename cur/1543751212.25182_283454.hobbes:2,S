FWIW at <$dayjob> we have had exactly the same issues using Win2k (ugh) 
and Promise's own drivers on a Dual Opteron system (Rioworks HDAMA) with 
an integrated Fastrak S150TX4 controller. Relatively stable using a 
single drive as a separate volume (our application prefers a RAID 0 
stripe), but random subtle corruptions when using an array (striped or 
mirrored). This is both using the controller's embedded RAID and W2K's 
software RAID (with the Promise configured to present separate disks). 
Firmware upgrades/downgrades were tried with no luck. We have two 
identically configured machines that both exhibit the same problem.
Interestingly, the errors were always single flipped bit(s) at random 
offset(s) within the file. Different on each run. Sounds like a RAM 
issue but both machines memtest fine and run without issues when using a 
single drive.
We never found a solution (we simply use single (large) SATA drives 
instead) :-(
