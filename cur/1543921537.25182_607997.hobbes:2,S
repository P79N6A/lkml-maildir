Subject: char/cyclades.c: inconsequent NULL checking

The Coverity checker spotted the following inconsequent NULL checking in 
drivers/char/cyclades.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static void cyz_handle_tx(struct cyclades_port *info,
                struct BUF_CTRL __iomem *buf_ctrl)
{
        struct cyclades_card *cinfo = info->card;
        struct tty_struct *tty = info->tty;
...
                if (tty == NULL)
                        goto ztxdone;
...
                tty_wakeup(tty);
...
<--  snip  -->
Nothing in cyz_handle_tx() seems to change "tty".
The "tty_wakeup(tty);" was added in commit 
ebafeeff0fea029099e9952f233e0794106897a6.
