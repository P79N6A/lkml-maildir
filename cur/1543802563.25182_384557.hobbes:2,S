cpu bound non interactive tasks have long timeslices. Tasks that have short 
timeslices like interactive ones or cpu bound ones at nice 19 have short 
timeslices. If a nice 0 and nice 19 task are running on the same cpu, the 
nice 19 one is going to be spending most of its time waiting in the runqueue. 
As soon as an idle cpu appears it will only pull a task that is waiting in a 
runqueue... and that is going to be the low priority tasks.

Doesn't appear to be system time. Extra idle time does suggest poor balancing 
though. Remember the effort I went to to avoid altering the delicate idle 
balancing...

Can't see how that is for what you say below.

The whole of userspace on a kernbench run is going to be nice 0. 
Let's wait till we confirm or deny this patch is responsible before 
postulating further.
