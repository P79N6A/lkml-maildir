Hello
This is the second time now that I've experienced a e100.c network
driver to suddenly stop forwarding packets over an interface without
giving further warnings in the syslog until I did a "ifconfig down",
"ifconfig up". The running kernel was 2.4.22 with 802.1q VLAN enabled
on the interface. There were 3 additional interfaces and normal load.
Last time this happens while using the version shipped with kernel
2.4.22, this time it was version 2.3.27 from the intel homepage.
Does anybody else had this bug? I don't like switching to the eepro100.c 
driver as it had MTU problems when using 802.1q VLANs.
bye,
-christian-
