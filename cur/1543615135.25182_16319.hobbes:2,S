It is not for anybody who handles large amounts of mail. I have yet to see
a browser which does even a half-assed attempt at doing email right.

Here (emacs + mh-e): ^ on the message, RET to confirm the folder. Managing?
No sweat, it is just another mail folder, to be handled by the same
commands my fingers do on their own now.

Plus the problem that thousands of (well meaning, but completely useless)
reports clog up bug<foo>, rquiring hand-cleaning by somebody who _really_
knows about the system. I.e., exactly the person whose work you want to
spare.

Look at the FAQ for the kernel (helpfully compiled by this list). Problems
that get identified tend to get fixed fast, so working at documenting them
in detail makes no sense at al.
If you want to know what is broken in _development_ kernels, you have to
read this list.
