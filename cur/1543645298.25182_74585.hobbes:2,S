Okay, a few more datapoints:
1) Case #1 happens much more frequently than case #2
2) I can trigger filesystem corruption with nothing but non-concurrent 
readdir()s and unlink()s
3) Although my initial tests were reaching the filesystem's inode limit, I've 
been able to reproduce case #1 with 153,129 free inodes and 217,294 free 
blocks.
4) Case #1 persists with Chris' stack overflow fix, modified to use memmove 
instead of memcpy
5) I have not been able to reproduce either error without the dir_index flag 
set. This may be due to the fact that my test program runs -much- more slowly 
without directory indexing.
