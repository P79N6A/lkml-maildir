You misunderstood.  Stop trying to incite riot, calm down, and pay
attention to what I actually wrote.  I'll explain it again in more
explicit terms:
You agree that drivers need to block various activities during suspend.  
Principally I/O requests, but other things as well.  So when one of 
these requests arrives, the driver has to make it wait somehow and then 
has to allow it to proceed at the appropriate time.
Normally a waitqueue or a struct completion would be used for this
purpose.  But either one puts the burden on the driver of defining a
data structure and signalling it at the right time.  That time is
generally when the device is resumed, but there's nothing wrong with
delaying it slightly, to after all the devices have been resumed (i.e.,
the time when the current PM code takes everything out of the freezer).  
In fact, we definitely don't want to unblock plug events until this
later time.
So instead, why not have the PM core take care of all this?  There
could be a block_task_until_suspend_is_over() routine available for all
drivers to use.  Its effect would be exactly the same as sending the
current task into the freezer, but it wouldn't be the freezer that
exists now.  It would just be some routine that blocks until the system 
suspend is over.  We could call it "the icebox" instead of "the 
freezer".  :-)
Does that make you happier?

User tasks can cause driver binding by writing to sysfs.  Binding 
_can't_ be blocked in the driver; by then it's already too late.  If 
it is going to be blocked at all, it has to be blocked earlier.  One 
possibility is in the sysfs attribute code; another is to block all 
sysfs access.
Of course, another possibility is simply to fail the bind.  But that's 
not very satisfying, since suspends should be transparent.

Ben, you haven't given enough thought to the work needed to avoid 
locking problems.
For instance, you agree that during suspend we must not allow device or
driver registration or unregistration, right?  And we must not allow
driver binding or unbinding.  But these events generally involve
acquiring a device semaphore, in the driver core and quite often in the
core's caller.  Since that semaphore is also needed for calling the
suspend and resume methods, we have to be very careful about blocking
binding/unbinding/registration/unregistration.  It has to be done at a 
time when no device semaphores are held.
You also agree that kernel threads and workqueues must be allowed to 
operate during suspend.  But consider this: By writing the appropriate 
sysfs attribute, a user task can cause a workqueue item to be queued to 
keventd that tries to unregister a device.  That really puts you on the 
spot: Unregistration can't be allowed to fail, it can't be allowed to 
succeed during a suspend, and keventd can't be blocked!  So what should 
we do?
