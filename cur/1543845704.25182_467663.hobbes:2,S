OK, here are my null-syscall results.  This is on a Intel(R) Pentium(R)
4 CPU 3.00GHz (stepping 9), single processor (SMP kernel).  
I did three sets of tests: before, with saving/restoring %gs, with using
%gs for per-cpu vars and current and smp_processor_id().
Before:
swarm5.0:Simple syscall: 0.3734 microseconds
swarm5.1:Simple syscall: 0.3734 microseconds
swarm5.2:Simple syscall: 0.3734 microseconds
swarm5.3:Simple syscall: 0.3734 microseconds
With saving/restoring %gs: (per-cpu was same)
swarm5.4:Simple syscall: 0.3801 microseconds
swarm5.5:Simple syscall: 0.3801 microseconds
swarm5.6:Simple syscall: 0.3804 microseconds
swarm5.7:Simple syscall: 0.3801 microseconds
That's a 6.5ns cost for saving and restoring gs, and other lmbench
syscall benchmarks reflected similar differences where the noise didn't
overwhelm them.
On kernbench, the differences were in the noise.
Strangely, I see a 4% drop on fork+exec when I used gs for per-cpu vars,
which I am now investigating (71.0831 usec before, 71.1725 usec with
saving, 73.7458 usec with per-cpu!).
Cheers,
Rusty.
