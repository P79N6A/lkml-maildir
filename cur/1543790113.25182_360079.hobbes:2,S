Hi,
  We've developed an automatic email mapping capability from Google Maps 
API.
  To try it out, we mapped origins of emails to this group from October 
2 through October 10th.
The result of this map is at:  
http://www.zeesource.net/maps/map.do?group=478
  Would like to hear what you think of it.
  Best wishes
Claire
