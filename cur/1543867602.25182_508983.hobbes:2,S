Absolutely. This is a very good point.
And users of binary blobs like nvidia.ko are already beginning to see
this problem.   (Nvidia dropped support for "legacy" cards a while back)
Only open drivers ensure ongoing vendor-independant support, which
is an important thing.   I'd not be happy buying a device that I know
the vendor is going to ship security updates for a year after release.
VJ, how long does your company support each product? And how much
engineering effort is spent doing so, vs effort that you could get
for free by opening your driver(s) ?

Even open drivers have the same problem.  Take for example longhaul.c.
I lost interest in this a while ago and moved on to shinier new hardware
(whilst it still had numerous problems) and rafal picked this up and has
been fixing it up like something possessed since.
If this were a closed driver, it would have been doomed never to improve.
It's a great example of one of the strengths of the open process.
