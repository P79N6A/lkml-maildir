When dealing with users and userspace for /proc/interrupts /proc/irq
and the like we need a way to talk about irqs.  Currently we use the
interrupt number for that and we are likely to break the user/kernel
interface if we don't preserve that.  Debugging would tend to suck
if we couldn't print out the irq number of the irq a driver has
been assigned and trace it through various data structures.
For hardware that is not hotplug or auto discoverable I think we will
need the irq number to talk about the ISA number as well.
So I don't see a way that we can get rid of a number completely but
it should be of much less significance.

Having taken a little bit of time to digest roughly what the concept
is I think I can finally answer this one.  
No.  I don't think we should make your irq_hwnumber_t thingy general
because it is not general.  I don't understand why you need it to be
an unsigned long, that still puzzles me.  But for the rest it actually
appears that ppc has a simpler model to deal with.
I don't think I actually can describe x86 hardware in you hwnumber_t
world.  Although I can approximate.
In non-legacy mode at the top of the tree I have a network cooperating
irq controllers.  For each cpu there is an lapic next to each cpu that
catches interrupt packets and below that I have interrupt controllers
that throw interrupt packets.  In the network of cooperating interrupt
controllers a interrupt packet has a destination address that looks
like (cpu#, vector#) where cpu# is currently at 8 bits and slowly
growing and the vector# is a fixed 8 bits.
The interrupt controllers that throw those packets have a fixed
number of irq slots usually 24 or so.  Each slot (referred to in the
code as a pin) can be programmed which (cpu#, vector#) packet it
throws when an interrupt occurs. Including an option to vary the cpu#
between a set of cpus.
So to be frank to handle this model properly I need to deal with
this properly I need.
#define NR_IRQS (NR_CPUS*256)
There is enough flexibility in this model that hardware vectors
have not found a need to cascade interrupt controllers.

Ben I have no problem with a number that is specific to an irq
controller for dealing with the internal irq controller
implementations, heck I think everyone has that to some degree
The linux irq number will remain an arbitrary software number for
use by the linux system for talking about the source of the
interrupt.
Why in a sparse address space you would find it hard to allocate a
range of numbers to an irq controller that only has a fixed number of
irqs it can deal with is something I don't understand and I think
it is does a disservice to your users.  But that is all it is
a quality of implementation issue.  ia64 does the same foolish
thing.
The only time it really makes sense to me to let the irq number vary
arbitrary are when things are truly dynamic, like with MSI, a
hypervisor, or hot plug interrupt controllers.

This definitely what I intend to have the gneirq code start allowing.
For all intents and purposes we already do this today.

Yes.

Yep.  Once we are done you can remove the reserve on 0.  And leave
0..15 only ever assigned to ISA style interrupts if they are in the
system.
I really don't like the term legacy or old/new, when referring to
things.  Because today's current hip/new is tomorrow legacy and
we have lots of generations of hardware.  
If we want to throw the legacy term around I hereby designate all non
MSI-X interrupt controllers legacy.

Sure, and I have the same issue with a big "DESIGNED FOR ppc" in the middle,
or "DESIGNED FOR arch/x".   However the unfortunate truth is that the x86
has enough volume that frequently other architectures use some x86
hardware and thus get some of x86's warts.   So anything that doesn't
cope with the x86's warts is frequently doomed to failure.
