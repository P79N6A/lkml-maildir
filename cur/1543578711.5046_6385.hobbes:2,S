NO NO NO!
You miss _entirely_ the reason why "get_module_symbol()" was removed,
and why I will not _ever_ accept it coming back.
Hint #1: get_MODULE_symbol().
Hint #2: compiled in functionality.
The fact is, that get_module_symbol() was seriously and totally
mis-designed from the very beginning, and it was removed for THAT
reason, and it had nothing at all to do with the count handling.
So stop this discussion. It's not coming back. Live with the current
interfaces.
