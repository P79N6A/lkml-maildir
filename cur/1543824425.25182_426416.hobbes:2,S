Jon, how many times am I going to have to tell you that this won't work? 
The video ROM is not always present on laptop hardware, and even when it 
is it may jump into sections of ROM that have vanished since boot. 
In the long run, graphics drivers need to know how to program cards from 
scratch rather than depending on 80x25 text mod being there for them.
