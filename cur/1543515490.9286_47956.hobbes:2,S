	Not refering to arp here (was not as clear as should have
been)
	I was talking about, 2 machine have the same Ip assigned to
them.  A packet goes out to said IP, with the MAC of machine A, if
machine B is not in promisc, everything is fine.  However, if machine
Bs interface in in promisc, the packet to the wrong MAC, but a local
IP will get handled and responded to by the IP layer.
	If this has changed in 2.2.x, and the kernel flags wrong MAC
addr packets before passing them to the IP layer great.
