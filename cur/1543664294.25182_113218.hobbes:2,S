Hi.
I've looked at LKCD and seen that they have a provision for compressing
the pages which are written. Ideally, I'd like to see us sharing code
because I reckon there's a fair bit in common between the two projects.
For the moment, though, I haven't seriously considered implementing
compression. I've just been concentrating on getting things as stable as
possible under 2.4 (given that there's no driver model there), and
beginning to seek to port the changes to 2.5. Perhaps compression could
be added later, but I am worrying about the basics (getting the pages
saved in any form!) first.
