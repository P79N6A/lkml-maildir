Ahh, one of the things I miss from the bad old mainframe days -- coming to
work in the morning and finding an email from the system monitoring
daemon:
	My memory is going bad.  Please call Field Service and ask them
	to replace board X.  Failing pages marked offline.
or
	I think disk X is going to fail in a few hours.  I suspect the Y
	module.  I've copied all the important stuff to one of the hot
	spares.  Nobody knows but us two.  Have a nice day.
