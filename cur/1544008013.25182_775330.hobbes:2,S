There continues to be nothing architected for that - it would be very
SoC specific and the precision and resolution is very variable if it's
provided at all.  About the best implementation is a 32-bit counter
being clocked at various rates depending on the implementation.
Our best implementation is used for sched_clock() with all the
cnt32_to_63() stuff to extend the size of the counter which as we've
seen from other threads, may cause problems if used for other purposes.
The next best implementation is probably the hrtimer stuff.
