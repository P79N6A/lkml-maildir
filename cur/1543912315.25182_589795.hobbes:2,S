Ok.  This provides enough context to understand what you are trying to do.
You do want the unix user id, not the filesystem notion.  Because you
are looking for the user.
So we have to figure out how to do the hard thing which is look at
who opened our netlink broadcast see if they are in the same user
namespace as current->user.  Which is a pain and we don't currently
have the infrastructure for.
