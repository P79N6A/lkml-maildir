Sally new draft:
ftp://ftp.normos.org/ietf/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-tcp-reset-00.txt
builds a strong case against the RST issue and maybe used to point
to problems despite ECN.
But you are right, it will be stronger and wiser to wait until this is
standardized before paying a visit to the site owners.
Any one wishing to volunteer, please still send your emails in --
we should be ready in a few days from now,
cheers,
