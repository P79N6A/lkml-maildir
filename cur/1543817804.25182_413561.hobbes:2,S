Subject: [Patch 0/3] Remove blkmtd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/4/44

This patchset removed blkmtd in three steps:
1. Mark it as deprecated,
2. mark block2mtd, the replacement, as no longer experimental and
3. remove the driver.
Eric suggested sending patch 1 and 2 directly to Linus while leaving
patch 3 in -mm as long as klibc remains there as well.  Andrew, do you
prefer me to send the first two patches to Linus or will you rather do
it yourself?
