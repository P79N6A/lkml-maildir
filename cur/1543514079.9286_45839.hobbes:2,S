Where can I download the IKD patch, and is that the location where a 2.2.13
version will appear?

Yes, there is a patch that incorporates this bit.. all releases since
the booboo was discovered will incorporate it again.  The booboo was
only recently discovered, so is only in latest. (why I sent you the
offline difflet.. knew you were fighting with an ugly little bugaboo
in a diagnostic tool.. not good)
I'll check the 2.2 version for cleanliness against 2.2.13.virgin and
get back to you (and Andrea) as soon as I can.
