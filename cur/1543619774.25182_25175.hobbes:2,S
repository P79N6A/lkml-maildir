I have an Inspiron 8100 and 2.4.13-ac5, with apmd-final. (I'm holding off 
upgrading until I stop seeing so much stuff about VM problems on lkml). It 
has two battery slots, left and right.
If I put the battery in the left slot and run 'apm' I get
AC on-line, battery charging: 84% (4:12)
If I take out the battery and run apm I get
AC on-line, no system battery
If I put it into the right slot I get
AC on-line
and /proc/apm says I have -1% battery free and -1 minutes remaining ;)
--
The battery was designed to go into the right slot, not the left (left is 
where the floppy drive goes).
--
I went to apm.c to look into patching it to support multiple batteries.
I found this function:
static int apm_get_battery_status(which, status, bat, life, nbat <- battery #)
but it's #if 0'd out, and isn't referred to anywhere in the code. I looked 
at the changelog in the file to try to determine when it stopped being 
used, and why, but I found no useful information, and I can't even ask the 
person who did it, since they didn't tell me they did...
