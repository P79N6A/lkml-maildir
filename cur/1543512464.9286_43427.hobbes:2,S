	Point being, it's all in userspace, so you can do what you want with
it.  As you mentioned, you can ignore it (server, unlikely you're really
going to be changing things very often anyway), or have a daemon ask the user
what he wants to do (client, cute GUI, whatnot), or have something between the
two.  Perhaps a daemon running as root that creates nodes based off of a config
file (Once the nodes are created a root user can go off and change the permissions
to his liking if he needs to).  Said daemon could also delete nodes based again
off of a config file.
	All user-configurable, all user-space, so users can do what they want.
This will also allow different people to come up w/ their own daemons, and
different distributions can use the one they like, or create their own.  Or they
don't have to have one, and can continue with things as they are.
