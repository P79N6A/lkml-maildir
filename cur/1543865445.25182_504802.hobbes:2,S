My point is that the driver can't be tested on every combination of 
hardware, so if the user
doesn't have the capability to override assumptions the driver makes 
then he is stuck.
I have had two different laptops that had to have boot time command line 
overrides to get the
driver to allow the hardware work at what it was spec-ed at.
