NAK.  This patch introduces a bug.  See below.

Now that len is set outside of the loop, it is always the same size. 
If count is large enough to require more than a single read, the the
original size will still be used and it could overflow the user's
buffer.
I agree that doing the kmallocs in a loop looks nasty.  But we need to
make sure moving out of the loop doesn't break things.
