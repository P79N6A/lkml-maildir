Hi Ingo,
	Here are two patches related to group cpu scheduling.
Patch 1/2 -> Fixes minor bugs and coding style issues
Patch 2/2 -> Improves group fairness on SMP systems.
This is probably one of the last big changes related to group scheduler
that I had on my plate. Pls apply if there is no objection from anyone.
