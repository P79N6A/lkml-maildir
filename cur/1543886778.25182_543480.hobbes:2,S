erm, I was being funny.  If you randomize a binary it won't run any more. 
cp /dev/random /bin/login.  Oh well.
My point is, we're not being told what is being randomized here.  Is it the
virtual starting address of the main executable mmap?  Of the shared
libraries also?  Is it the stack location?  What?
I could reverse-engineer that info from the patch, I guess, but I'd prefer
to go in the opposite direction: you tell us what the patch is trying to
do, then we look at it and see if we agree that it is in fact doing that.
