another basic problem about allowing map_user_kiobuf to succeed on
invalid pages, is that calling PageReserved/SetPageDirty on a null
pointer will crash, etc...

invalid page is found sounds like the cleaner fix (possibly in function
of yet another bitflag, so if somebody wants to get the nearby pages
regardless of an invalid pages somewhere, it can).
