 Well, yeah, all schedulers have dispatch queue (noop has only the
dispatch queue) and use them to defer/requeue, so no reordering will
happen, but I'm not sure they are required to be like this or just
happen to be implemented so.
 Hmm, well, it seems that setting REQ_SOFTBARRIER on requeue path isn't
necessary as we have INSERT_FRONT policy on requeue, and if
elv_next_req_fn() is required to return the same request when the
request isn't dequeued, you're right and we don't need this patch at
all.  We are guaranteed that all requeued requests are served in LIFO
manner.
 BTW, the same un-dequeued request rule is sort of already broken as
INSERT_FRONT request passes a returned but un-dequeued request, but,
then again, we need this behavior as we have to favor fully-prepped
requests over partially-prepped one.
