On a machine with a Neomagic NM2200 [MagicGraph 256AV] VGA controller, under
2.6.0, boot parameter vga=0x317 causes a blank screen and might be hanging
the entire machine.  There is no response to Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Holding the
power switch for 4 seconds results in a warning beep from the BIOS and then
power down.
This is very similar to problems that were reported during 2.6.0-test days,
with an older Neomagic chip and smaller screen.  I don't recall if
Ctrl-Alt-Del might have yielded a reboot at that time.
As always, this can be fixed by booting 2.4.20.  Or by omitting the vga=
parameter.
Oddly, I have found some combination of drivers to compile as built-in and
some to compile as modules, so that early in the boot sequence the screen
automatically switches from 80x25 to somewhere around 128x40 even without
the vga= parameter.  No free penguin though.
