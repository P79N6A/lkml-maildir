Maybe there is a problem in the driver, that it does not report the media 
change, but anyway, you WILL get a corrupted filesystem, when you unmount 
such disk with another media in drive - it is exactly like that - the driver 
didn't report the change and the filesystem layer thinks, that it has still 
the same media in drive and happily flushes e.g. ext2 data to a VFAT disk ... 
Then you get the corruption of the second disk. 
But I am not familiar with the sbp2 driver, but this is a quite standard 
behavior for removable media.
