Please don't, this would break the interface logically.
X86_FEATURE_xxx usually denotes a *feature*, not a "feature"
(Micro$oft speak for "bug" ;).
IOW most flags express a positive attribute, not a negative one.
An exception to this probably is X86_FEATURE_FXSAVE_LEAK and
X86_FEATURE_CMP_LEGACY, but all others seem to be positive, so we might
want to enforce this rule.
Thus, how about e.g. X86_FEATURE_LAPIC_C1_OK?
Or is this less precise from a "C1 working ok" detection point of view?
(i.e. we'd just assume by default that most machines are ok except the ones
where we have issue detection code for, which might be too fuzzy)
