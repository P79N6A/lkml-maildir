	Except that my reasoning isn't based on anyone's opinions of their own
arguments.

	What convinced you? Someone telling you that you were not competent to
evaluate the evidence or someone *presenting* the evidence?

	This is a paragraph-length version of "that's what you think". You can give
me all the reasons you want why I can't evaluate a position, all that does
is lead to the conclusion that I can't participate in the argument. But if
you're the one trying to convince me, convincing me that I can't evaluate
competing positions gets you absolutely nowhere.
	This thing started because Larry advanced and defended a position. When
others responded with contrary arguments, his response was that even though
he considered their arguments, he felt free to reject them because they came
from people who didn't have the credentials he required. If his purpose in
advocating the position was merely to convince himself that he was right,
this is fine. But that was not his apparent purpose.

	Because you find his arguments more persuasive or because you are more
impressed by his credentials?
