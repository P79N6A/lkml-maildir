Dear all,
I'm sorry for the silly questoin.
My kernel version is 2.6.17
But I've just installed the 802.11 stack on my Debian 3.1.
But I got that the module can't find some external module:
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.17-5/kernel/net/ieee80211/softmac/ieee80211softmac.ko
needs unknown symbol wireless_send_event
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.17-5/kernel/net/ieee80211/ieee80211.ko needs
unknown symbol wireless_spy_update
And I think that I'll have to install the NET_WIRELESS module.
But I can't find it.
When I look for wireless in menuconfig of the kernel, I found that
NET_WIRELESS=n.
Would anyone be kind enough telling how to enable NET_WIRELESS?
Thanks in advance.
