Subject: hangs with IDE disks and SCSI CD-RW driver - 2.4.18 & 2.4.22; SMP

I've been getting complete system hangs apparently associated with
burning CDs on a SCSI CD-RW drive and using IDE disks on kernels
2.4.18 and 2.4.22 (with DMA disabled except for one disk on a 
Promise PDC20268-based controller) on a dual-Athlon MP system.
(And I do use a PS/2 mouse.)
At least with 2.4.18, I sometimes get temporary (5 to 10 seconds?)
hangs, seemingly when there's heavy disk activity.
Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Any suggestions (well, practical
ones, please)?
Daniel
