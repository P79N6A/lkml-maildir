Subject: Re: [PATCH 3/3] IRQ: Maintain regs pointer globally rather than passing to IRQ handlers

The overwhelming majority of irq handlers don't use the 'irq' argument 
either...  the driver-supplied pointer is what drivers use, exclusively, 
to differentiate between different instances.
If we are going to break all the irq handlers, I'd suggest going ahead 
and removing that one too.
