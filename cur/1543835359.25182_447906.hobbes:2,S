It just hited me that 90% of mails (those I've read and remember) in which
You guys are talking why r4 should or should not be merged did not contain
a patch or not even a line of code as a reference, most of complains feels
so abstract and ahead of time, there is nothing wrong with planing ahead
but does it still makes sense when nobody else actually said that he would
want to use it in future? Can't it be pusshed up to vfs later if it proves
itself and there is demand for it?
My question is what does it break now? It's been in mm for some time now,
what troubles does it couse? Did anyone complained that it breaks mm and
should be dropped?
I'm just a end user and have no idea of linux internals, but all the fuzz
about r4 seems so political and it's not just me who thinks so.
