The comments are still the same as before and need to be corrected 
manually.

None. Actually you can insert lots of '---' as separators almost anywhere 
you want. The converter used ---help--- for large help texts to separate 
them a bit better from the other options.

Here a small howto for CML1 users.
cml1:
bool/tristate/int/... /prompt/ /symbol/ /word/
kconfig:
config /symbol/
	bool /prompt/
	default /word/
(bool/tristate have now defaults as well.)
cml1:
define_bool /symbol/ /word/
kconfig:
config /symbol/
	bool
	default /word/
cml1:
dep_bool /prompt/ /symbol/ /dep/ ...
kconfig:
config /symbol/
	bool /prompt/
	depends on /dep/=y && ...
cml1:
dep_mbool /prompt/ /symbol/ /dep/ ...
dep_int...
kconfig:
config /symbol/
	bool /prompt/
	depends on /dep/ && ...
cml1:
choice /prompt/ /word/ /word/
kconfig:
choice
	prompt /prompt/
	default /symbol/
config
	....
endchoice
Especially the choice statement became much more powerful. Multiple 
defaults are possible, every choice value can have further dependencies 
and it can be tristate.
Dependencies are very close to the old behaviour with only some small 
differences, e.g. '-a'/'-o' are simply '&&'/'||', "CONFIG_FOO"="y" becomes 
FOO=y and only FOO has the same meaning as in dep_tristate.  Important 
here is that the undefined state is gone and kconfig will soon start 
emit warnings for undefined symbols used in expressions.
bye, Roman
