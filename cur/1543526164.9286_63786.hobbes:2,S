I'm probably going ot be the 12th person to submit this, but there's a
slight typo in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c in 2.3.46 which breaks
compilation...
the fix is simple: change line 256 in the file to say
    q->back_merge_fn     = ll_back_merge_fn;
instead of 'q->back_merges_fn'..
it wasn't worth running through 'diff'.....
