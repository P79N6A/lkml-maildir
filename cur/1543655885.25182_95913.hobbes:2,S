I recall this - now. Anyway the following fragment teels the full story :-)
cmd_link_multi-y = $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) -r -o $@ $(filter $(addprefix $(obj)/,$($(subst $(obj)/,,$(@:.o=-objs))) $($(subst $(obj)/,,$(@:.o=-y)))),$^)
In clear text:
For all prerequisite .o files (file.o) where there exist a -objs (file-objs)
or a -y (file-y) variable use the value of that variable instead.
