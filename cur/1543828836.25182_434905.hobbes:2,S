So what's the final fixup?  Last two patches don't seem to cause the 
problems previously reported by me.  They don't play together though, 
so I'll add my general sense of confusion to this issue ;)  
Should I run the thing (which patch?) and compile a hundred kernels 
or something to see what (if anything) breaks.  Shortest day of year 
here, I don't mind running the test box as part of room heating :o)
Thanks,
Grant.
