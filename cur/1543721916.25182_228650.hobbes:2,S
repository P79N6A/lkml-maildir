Your memory is apparently in dentry and inode memory:
	ext3_inode_cache   62553  62553   4096		(244MB)
	dentry_cache       48768  48768   4096		(190MB)
and it really looks like you have enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, which 
just eats memory like mad (a dentry is normally ~200 bytes, but then when 
it is rounded up to page-size, it takes 20 times the memory).
So don't enable DEBUG_PAGEALLOC unless you really want to debug some 
strange problem.
That said, there might be a memory balancing problem too, and
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC just makes it more obvious.  Nick Piggin reports that an
"obvious fix" by Andrew potentially causes problems, and if you're a BK
user, you could try just backing out this cset:
	ChangeSet@1.1722.88.2, 2004-06-03 07:58:03-07:00, akpm@osdl.org
	  [PATCH] shrink_all_memory() fixes
	....
(check with "bk changes" what the revision is in your tree, and do a
	bk cset -xX.XXX.XX.X
to try reverting it. Quite possibly that fix makes the VM much less likely
to throw out the VM caches, which would make the debug problem much 
worse).
