Linux creates a 'native Linux thread' via clone() in about 10
microseconds. So SCO creates a thread in 10 nanoseconds - ie. faster than
a cacheline load on most CPUs - wow!
glibc creates a pthread in about 300 microseconds, thats certainly slow.
(but then again, still faster than NT's thread creation latency.) I doubt
SCO creates a pthread in 0.3 microseconds.
