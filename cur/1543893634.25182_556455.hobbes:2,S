All calls relevant to this thread require CAP_SYS_RAWIO.

ata_scsi_pass_thru() is not executed at ioctl submission time (block 
queue submission time), but rather immediately before it is issued to 
the drive.  At that point you know the bus is idle, all other commands 
have finished executing, and dev->multi_count is fresh not stale.  The 
code path goes from ata_scsi_pass_thru() to ata_qc_issue() without 
releasing the spinlock, even.
But the last point is true -- we should error rather than just warn 
there, AFAICS.
