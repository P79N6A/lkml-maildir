Right, this seems to 'rely' on rq->curr lagging behind put_prev_task().
So by doing something like:

We would avoid being considered running while we're not.
We set rq->curr to rq->idle, because rq->curr is assumed valid at all
times. Also, should we clear TIF_NEED_RESCHED right before
pick_next_task()?

I'm not liking the initial patch much because it allows for a situation
where we're not on the RQ but are considered running. That just doesn't
make sense to me.
