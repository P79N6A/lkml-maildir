Not only that RedHat shipped it, but thousands of people used Alan's
patches since 25th February. So you cannot check kernel version for >=2.4.4.

vmnet is GPLed software, if you did not notice ;-) Fortunately change
went into Alan tree first, so I noticed long before 2.4.4 came out. Although
it took nonzero effort to persuade others that it will go into Linus's 2.4.x
even if it breaks API. They did not trust me that source compatibility 
in stable series is only a wish.
