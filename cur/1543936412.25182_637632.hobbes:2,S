I think this will be OK.  We'll end up with three pci_ops, one for
mmconfig-only, one for mixed mmconfig-conf1 and one for conf1.  We could
do with that now actually -- the machines which will definitely go beserk
if you try to use mmconfig could have the conf1 ops on those busses.
Let's take Ivan's patch for now, and do that patch for 2.6.26.
