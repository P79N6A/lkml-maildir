Have you proposed it for inclusion in the official tree? Many distros today
don't ship drivers that aren't in the oficial tree, so you are needlessly
limiting your customer base (plus adding hassle for them, plus you have to
track kernel changes yourself). Not a winning proposition, IMHO.
Thanks for your support of Linux!
