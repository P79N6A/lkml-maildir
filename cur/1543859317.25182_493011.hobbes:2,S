This is purely for data=journal, which is rarely used.
In journalled-data mode, write(), write-fault, etc are not allowed to dirty
the pages and buffers, because the data has to be written to the journal
first.  After the data has been written to the journal we only then mark
buffers (and hence pages) dirty as far as the VFS is concerned.  For
checkpointing the data back to its real place on the disk.
For MAP_SHARED pages ext3 cheats madly and doesn't journal the data at all.
In all journalling modes, MAP_SHARED data follows the regular ext2-style
handling.  Which is a bit of a wart.
