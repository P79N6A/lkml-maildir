Yes, I know there's no hard and fast rule for the exact ammount of ram/swap one
needs that will always work.  However, in 2.2 for a 'workstation' one could
usually quite happily get away with having 128:128 and never have much of a
problem.  with 2.4.0 and up this isn't the case.  This has been the cause
of many people complaining quite loudly about 2.4 VM sucking and having
lots of OOM kills going about.  It's also been called an 'aritificial limit'
since one of the VM people had a patch to 'fix' this.  What I'm trying to
figure out is if this problem exists linearly or just with 'lower' ammounts
of total physical ram.  ie if I jump up to 512mb and don't have a webserver
or database (ie I've got 512mb so I end up with a big disk cache) will I need
to have 1gb of swap just to keep the VM happy?  Will 256 be enough?  Could I
even live w/o swap?
