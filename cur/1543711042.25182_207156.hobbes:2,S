Hi All,
I want to develop a block driver which should work on both uni-processor
and SMP machine.
What are the issues that are to be addressed when dealing with SMP? I
mean for Compiling the module and Interrupt Handling on SMP machine.
I have gone through all the archives but I did not find any suitable
answer....
 
Thanks in advance
