Greetings all..
I have two questions as described in my subject line. 
1. How do I get to play with USB in the kernel at this stage? I'm using
2.2.13 and have set Prompt for development or incomplete drivers on. I was
still not presented with any usb options in the menuconfig. I see in
Makefile, it says 
ifeq ($(CONFIG_USB),y)
DRIVERS := $(DRIVERS) drivers/usb/usb.a
endif
I then set CONFIG_USB=y in my .config and did make dep; make clean; make
bzImage;
I see that when I do this, in the make dep section it seems to look in
drivers/usb and it does _something_  ?  with drivers/usb in the make
bzImage... I'm not much of a hacker so I'm still trying to work out what
it is doing there... I see it is referencing ohci and uhci... I can't seem
to find any help on this in the USB howto. The main reason for all this
effort is to stop having to use a converter to ps2 from usb for my
logitech mouse :-) 
2. Does anyone have any pointers as to who, if anyone is currently
championing the cause of the Sound Blaster Live with Creative Labs? If
someone is, could I please get pointed at their contact details so I can
add my efforts to theirs. If no-one is doing this at the moment, does
anyone know who I could start liasing with at Creative Labs to try and get
some specs / source / anything that might help get the soundblaster live
going under kernels other than 2.2.5 and 2.2.10... As it stands, you
_have_ to recompile your kernel down to 2.2.10 instead of being able to
use the default 2.2.12 that comes with RedHat 6.1. And if you want to play
with experimental kernels, then you better have a good hi-fi, coz you
can't listen to MP3's and fiddle... :-(
