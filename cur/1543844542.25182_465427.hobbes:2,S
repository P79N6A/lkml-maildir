are you arguing that i'm trying to force breakpoint-based probing on 
you? I dont. In fact i explicitly mentioned that i'd accept and support 
a 5-byte NOP in the body of the marker, in the following mails:
    "just go for [...] the 5-NOP variant"

        (my reply to your second proposal)
    "or at most one NOP"
      http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115865412332230&w=2
        (my reply to your third proposal)
    "at most a NOP inserted"
      http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115886524224874&w=2
        (my reply to your fifth proposal)
That enables the probe to be turned into a function call - not an INT3 
breakpoint. Does it take some effort to implement that on your part? 
Yes, of course, but getting code upstream is never easy, /especially/ in 
cases where most of the users wont use a particular feature.
> - High performance computing users won't want a breakpoint-based probe
I am not forcing breakpoint-based probing, at all. I dont want _static, 
build-time function call based_ probing, and there is a big difference. 
And one reason why i want to avoid "static, build-time function call 
based probing" is because high-performance computing users dont want any 
overhead at all in the kernel fastpath.

djprobes over a NOP marker are perfectly usable and safe: just add a 
simple constraint to them to only allow a djprobes insertion if it 
replaces a 5-byte NOP.

it is possible with the marker mechanism i outlined before:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115886524224874&w=2
have i missed to address any concern of yours?
