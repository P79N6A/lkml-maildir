LVM2 is GPL/LGPL-licensed - just like the original version of LVM.
This means the whole Linux community benefits from this aspect of
Sistina's work.  The device-mapper and LVM2 packages will *always* be
GPL/LGPL.
As those who have been following LVM development closely will be aware,
the decision to rewrite was taken for sound technical - not licensing -
reasons, and of course we welcome and encourage contributions to LVM2
from outside Sistina.
