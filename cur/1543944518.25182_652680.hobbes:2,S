If there was a "fundamental thing that didn't cause a conflict", then
the two trees in question probably didn't touch the same code, so would
probably merge cleanly, for the same reason that one rebased onto the
other cleanly.  But depending on what the "fundamental thing" was, the
merge might still introduce the same bug, right?
