Wouldn't autodetection be the better solution?  Seems to me the kernel
has
no problem detecting all the buses, so why not break the probing into a
two-
pass thing - first pass simply counts buses, second pass allocate memory
and fills in the arrays.  
(One-pass is possible too, if dynamic allocation is possible at this
time.)
No config option to worry about, no excess room for 32 buses on ordinary
pc's, no worry for the 100-bus user.
