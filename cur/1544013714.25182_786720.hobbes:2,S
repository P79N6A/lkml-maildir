Really?
My 850 Linux boxes are 166MHz ARMs and occasionally NFS-mounted.
Their /bin/sh does not do $((...)), and Bash is not there at all.
If I were installing GCC natively on them, I'd install GNU Make and a
proper shell while I were at it.  But I don't know if Bash works
properly without fork()* - or even if GCC does :-)
Perl might be hard, as shared libraries aren't supported by the
toolchain which targets my ARMs* and Perl likes its loadable modules.
I'm not sure why I would want to build a kernel on these devices.
But I see why people with mobile ARM devices like gphones might
want to, when they're out travelling.
