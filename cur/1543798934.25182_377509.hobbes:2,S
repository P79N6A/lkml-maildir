No.  If writing an os from scratch, then using 4k stacks would
be absolutely trivial.  The problems now happens only because
we're switching away from the 8k stacks people were used to having.
Design with 4k stacks from the start, and you'll see people writing
code with the assumption that they can't stick more than a handful
of ints/pointers on the stack.
If you design with 64k stacks then people _use_ that memory, and
soon you hear someone wanting 128k stacks to be "safe".  That
way you end up with windows.  Note that 64k is 16 pages, and they
have to be _consecutive_.  It don't take much fragmentation before
you can't get that many consecutive pages - you can easily have 3/4 of your
memory unused, ready to be taken, but still be unable to get 16 
consecutive pages.
To see this - create a small kernel module that tries to allocate 64k
of consecutive memory when loaded.  Try loading it after a few days
of normal use, and see how often your server fails to do it.
