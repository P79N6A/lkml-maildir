On testing this patch, it doesn't build.  You need to include
linux/pm.h into linux/sysdev.h for starters, and fix sysdev.h
to also use pm_message_t in it's function pointers.
Therefore, I'd like the following patch either to be in mainline first,
or in my ARM tree for Linus to pull so ARM doesn't completely break
on my next merge.
