No, the dev argument is alright.  We use it a few lines above in the
same function in a call to dma_map_single().  The dev argument is IMO
correctly obtained here:
static int
pci_probe(struct pci_dev *dev, const struct pci_device_id *ent)
{
	...
	fw_card_initialize(&ohci->card, &ohci_driver, &dev->dev);
	...
}
void
fw_card_initialize(struct fw_card *card, const struct fw_card_driver
*driver, struct device *device)
{
	...
	card->device = device;
	...
}
So, ohci->card.device is in fact &pci_dev->dev.
Also note:
  - The very same code did not oops at this point in 2.6.22.  It only
    started doing so in 2.6.23.
  - There has been no other report of this kind for any other
    architecture yet.  I would expect e.g. the PPC64 folks to report
    bugs in our dma mappings eventually.
-----
Two footnotes:
  - Although the 2.6.22 firewire subsystem does not oops during the
pci_probe like it does in 2.6.23 and 2.6.24, it does lock up sometime
later during actual use.  However this is not surprising, as I found and
fixed some portential DMA mapping issues in the fw-sbp2 highlevel driver
sometime after 2.6.22.  But due to the pci_probe problem, the firewire
subsystem doesn't get as far on sparc64 on 2.6.23 and 2.6.24.
  - One thing which we do slightly wrong in ar_context_add_page() is that we
1.) dma-map the buffer,
2.) continue to write into the buffer from the CPU,
3.) then sync it for the device.
I let the reporter try a patch which inserted a
dma_sync_single_for_cpu() right after the dma_map_single() in order to
be clearly entitled to access the buffer by the CPU, but that didn't fix it.
