I agree.
I get around 4MB/s without and 35.75MB/s with...
hdparm -c3 -d1 -m16 /dev/hda
on a KT133 (A7V) and 45GB IBM DTLA hard drive.
no data corruption, even with a sblive, an scsi
adapter, 2 hard drives...

All that is gold does not glitter,
	Not all those who wander are lost,
The old that is strong does not wither,
	Deep roots are not touched by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
	A light from the shadows shall spring,
Renewed shall the blade that was broken,
	The crownless again shall be king.
