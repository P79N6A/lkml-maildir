Hi,
Have you tried to build ide-scsi support into the kernel? I will
try to compile the kernel with ide-scsi support as modules and see
how it goes when I get home. I did write down the oops that i get
and posted it on the list. I haven't got any feed back on it yet.
The original post of the Oops is here

Thanx
