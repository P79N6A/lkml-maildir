yes please (feel free to CC me on the answers), I'd really like to
reduce the scheduler O(N) overhead to the number of the running tasks,
rather than doing the recalculate all over the processes in the machine.
O(1) scheduler would be even better of course, but the below would
ensure not to hurt the 1 task running case, and it's way simpler to
check for correctness (so it's easier to include it as a start).
