 That's probably a result of our local APIC setup code being a bit 
careless when seting up the ExtINTA mode.  The mode is used for a 
cooperation between an 8259A PIC and a local APIC in the so-called 
virtual-wire mode.

 It's output at most once not to clutter the log.

 The PIT timer (IRQ 0 above) is edge-triggered, so it cannot cause
spurious interrupts as a trail of real ones.  Ditto for the keyboard
controller (IRQ 1) and onboard IDE (IRQ 14).  The local APIC timer
interrupt (LOC) doesn't go through the 8259A.
 So without additonal debugging, I'd suspect noise on the interrupt lines,
either due to a board design error or an erratum in one of devices (IRQ
9?).
