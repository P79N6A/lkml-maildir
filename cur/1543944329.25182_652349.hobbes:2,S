Hello list.
Seeking feedback for this patch which adds support for the "fn" key on 
the new macbook (3,1) and apple aluminum keyboard.
I have tested this with kernel 2.6.23 (both 2.6.23.9 and 2.6.23.15) 
under Fedora 8 and it seems to work for me.
The original patch was created by Martin Szulecki (of mactel-linux) and 
  Chris Irwin. I can't take any credit - I've just found that it works 
and would like to see it tested and committed upstream if possible.
I am linking to the patch because a) its quite long, and b) I am not 
sure how to prevent thunderbird from wrapping the lines and I'd hate to 
annoy the list with some malformed garbage.
Patch is here:

Regards
Chris
