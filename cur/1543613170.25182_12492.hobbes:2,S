The MP 1.1/1.4 mappings have no information on memory or locality. The ACPI
stuff seems to have the same limitations. The ACPI one does correctly
describe hyperthreading pairs (two execution units per die) - but while they
are "closer" they are also less efficient than two seperate cpus for most
tasks.
