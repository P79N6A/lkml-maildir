   Last march David Miller proposed using kiobuf for these data
   transfers, I've written a new patch for 2.4.
   (David's original patch contained 2 bugs: it doesn't protect
   properly against multiple writers and it causes a BUG() in
   pipe_read() when data is stored in both the kiobuf and the normal
   buffer)
A couple months ago David posted a revised version of his patch which
fixed both these and some other problems.  Most of the fixes were done
by Alexey Kuznetsov.
Later,
David S. Miller
