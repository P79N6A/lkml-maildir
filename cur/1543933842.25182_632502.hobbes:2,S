Ahh, it seems to be a alpine bug. Probably brought on by alpine trying to 
highlight the web addresses.
It doesn't always happen - between Rank 3 and Rank 4, you have an empty 
line, and alpine reacted correctly to that one, but the "empty" line 
between Rank 1 and Rank 2 actually contained a single TAB, and that 
apparently made alpine really confused.
So never mind. I'll make a bug-report on alpine, it wasn't a bug in your 
email.
