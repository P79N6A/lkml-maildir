I suppose this is because cpuset's offer some middle ground between 
collecting data per-cpu
vs. collecting it for all cpus (as being done now) ?
What happens when someone is using cpusets on such a machine and changes 
its membership
in response to other needs. All taskstats users would need to monitor 
for such changes and
adjust their processing....seems like unnecessary tying up of two 
unrelated concepts.
