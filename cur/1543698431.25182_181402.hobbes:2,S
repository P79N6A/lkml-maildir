[Please take my apologies if this is old news, I didn't find much about
it on the net though.]
Hi,
I used to run a crypted 120GB disk for some data storage without any problem
so far. Now I got myself a notebook and tried connecting this disk via a
USB adapter. This works okay for some time, but at some point errors
out:
Dec  3 10:25:50 feivel kernel: SCSI device sda: 241254720 512-byte hdwr sectors (123522 MB)

...
Actually this already happens when I just try to e2fsck the ext3
filesystem on this disk. It always fails.
I tried enabling verbose messages in USB but this doens't change much it
seems:
...

Dec  3 13:36:49 feivel kernel: Buffer I/O error on device loop1, logical block 64
...
All this is kernel vesion 2.6.0-test11. I also tried test9 with the same
results and 2.4.21, but that didn't work either.
I'm not sure where to look now. Any ideas?
Michael
