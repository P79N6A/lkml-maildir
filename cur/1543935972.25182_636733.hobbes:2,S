The interrupt lines are set by the traces on the PC board and
the contents of various "glue" chips and FPGAs. Many lap-tops,
for instance, only have one IRQ serving any PCI devices. If
your screen card can't share the only IRQ you have, it is
broken. Contact the vendor of both your motherboard (they
may have a BIOS upgrade) and the screen card (they may
have a fix).
