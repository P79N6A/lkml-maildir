BTW, arbitrated loop absolutely sucks if you're in a hi-av clustered
environment.  By definition, every host's card has to pass along packets
not meant for itself.  If you reboot one of the nodes while I/O is
happening, that I/O gets clobbered with *NO* indication that it hit the
bit bucket.  Proceed slowly to timeout, do not collect the buffer, do not
pass go.
