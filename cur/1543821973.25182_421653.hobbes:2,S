Load average is a bit of an odd metric in this case, try looking at the
output from 'vmstat 1', and especially the 'id' column. As long as that
doesn't rise, you don't have an actual problem.
The number of processes in the runqueue doesn't really tell you anything
about how much CPU you are using.
Having said that, I think there might be a problem to be solved.
