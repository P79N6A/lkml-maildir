Well well having a look at lilo-s inwards I can the the following:
     if (ioctl(fd,HDIO_GETGEO,&hdprm) < 0)
                 die("geo_query_dev HDIO_GETGEO (dev 0x%04x): %s",device,
                   strerror(errno));
             geo->heads = hdprm.heads;
             geo->cylinders = hdprm.cylinders;
             geo->sectors = hdprm.sectors;
             geo->start = hdprm.start;
             if ((geo->device = bios_device(geo, device)) < 0)
                 geo->device = 0x80 + (MINOR(device) >> 6) +
                     (MAJOR(device) == MAJOR_HD ? 0 : 
last_dev(MAJOR_HD,64));
If you look at the boot messages from a kernel:
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
  hda: 78140160 sectors, CHS=77520/16/63, UDMA(33)
  hda: hda1 hda4
You can actually see the CHS info field.
Would you care to maybe compare them between 2.4 and 2.5 on the
system in question?
If they are not different, well, taking a look at the bios_device()
in lilo you can actually see that it doesn't know *anything* about
EZ disk or similar partition table tricks and therelike - this can be
definitively considered a bug *there*.
