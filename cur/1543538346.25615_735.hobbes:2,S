Indeed. Follow-ups to /dev/null please. This code is definitely under GPL.
I've clarified the comments, and have sent a patch to Linus. It now reads...
/* Linux driver for NAND Flash Translation Layer      */
/* (c) 1999 Machine Vision Holdings, Inc.             */
/* Author: David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>      */

  The contents of this file are distributed under the GNU Public
  Licence version 2 ("GPL"). The legal note below refers only to the
  _use_ of the code in some jurisdictions, and does not in any way
  affect the copying, distribution and modification of this code,
  which is permitted under the terms of the GPL.
  Section 0 of the GPL says:
 "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope."
  You may copy, distribute and modify this code to your hearts'
  content - it's just that in some jurisdictions, you may only _use_
  it under the terms of the licence below. This puts it in a similar
  situation to the ISDN code, which you may need telco approval to
  use, and indeed any code which has uses that may be restricted in
  law. For example, certain malicious uses of the networking stack
  may be illegal, but that doesn't prevent the networking code from
  being under GPL.
  In fact the ISDN case is worse than this, because modification of
  the code automatically invalidates its approval. Modificiation,
  unlike usage, _is_ one of the rights which is protected by the
  GPL. Happily, the law in those places where approval is required
  doesn't actually prevent you from modifying the code - it's just
  that you may not be allowed to _use_ it once you've done so - and
  because usage isn't addressed by the GPL, that's just fine.
