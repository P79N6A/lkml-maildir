Yes, see Documentation/i386/* (although some of it is documented by 
reference to include/asm-x86/boot_params.h).

Fair enough, however...

I believe kexec currently tries to reconstitute it from what data is 
available to it.  This is incomplete, though, and has been flagged as a 
problem for kexec.

It can pick it up from <asm/boot_params.h> (which is now 
userspace-safe); or it can decode it itself.  Programs like kexec can 
pass through most of the data without examining it, this is the main 
reason for having it as a blob.
