I send this again because my first mail accidently had html code in it and 
might have been filtered by some people.

I did some more tests with my BCM4401 and different kernels, here are the 
results:

The system was unusable while i ran the iperf test, when I moved the mouse it 
was only jumping around and doing anything like starting programs or 
switching the desktop first happend after iperf had finished it's test.
I did a http downlaod with wget and got 11.23M/s.

System responsiveness was the same as with 2.6.21.1.
wget got 11.23M/s, again same as 2.6.21.1.

Here system responsiveness was ok whil I ran iperf, I didn't notic anything 
anomalous.
When I tried the wget http download the tranfer did stall and from this point 
on I couldn't send or receive anything on my BCM4401 anymore. Taken the 
interface down and up again didn't help anything. I wonder if this is Uwe's 
problem
on all the kernels there apperaded nothing special in dmesg.
for the iperf test I connect my BCM4401 directly with an e100. The system with 
the e100 was iperf server and ran fine all over the test.
