Hello!
kernel (redhat) : 2.4.18-14
I don't know why, but the AGP do not work on this
chipset and the hard drive and CD-Roms do not seem to
be very fast, like it could.  Is it a problem with my
machine or is it that the kernel is not currently
supporting it.  Will it be supported one day by the
kernel if it's the problem ?
Thanks 
Matt
