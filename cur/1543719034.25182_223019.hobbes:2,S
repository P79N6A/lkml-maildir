He was asking for proper bugreport.
Preparing bug report:
=====================
How To Ask Questions The Smart Way:
    
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
        Anybody who has written software for public use will
        probably have received at least one bad bug report.
        Reports that say nothing ("It doesn't work!");
        reports that make no sense; reports that don't give
        enough information; reports that give wrong information.
How to Report Bugs Effectively:
    
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html
        Before asking a technical question by email, or in
        a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following:
        * Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
        * Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
        * Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
        * Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
        * Try to find an answer by reading the source code.
Compile problems: report GCC output and result of
        "grep '^CONFIG_' .config"
Oops: decode it with ksymoops (or use 2.6 with kksymoops enabled ;).
Unkillable process: Alt-SysRq-T and ksymoops relevant part.
Yes it means you should have ksymoops installed and tested,
which is easy to get wrong. I've done that too often.
