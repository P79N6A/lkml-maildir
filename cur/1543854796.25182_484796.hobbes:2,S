Hi,
On UP (non-SMP) i386 builds (without DEBUG_SPINLOCK),
I see this warning:
drivers/input/ff-memless.c:384: warning: implicit declaration of function 'local_bh_disable'
drivers/input/ff-memless.c:393: warning: implicit declaration of function 'local_bh_enable'
How do we get these functions explicitly declared?
When I include linux/interrupt.h, I just get lots more errors,
although maybe it (only) needs types.h to fix most of those
(but I'm too sleepy to look right now :).
config attached.
