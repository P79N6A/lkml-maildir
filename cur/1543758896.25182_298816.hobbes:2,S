Is there some reason why
	bk changes -aem -rv2.6.10..+ | shortlog
isn't sufficient?
I'd guess your script will want to calculate the 2.6.10 part
automatically, but that seems to run in a second or so on my machine,
from a largely cold cache.  I *think* this gets all the changes where a
-d (date) based method gets very confused by parallel trees.  Am I
missing something?
