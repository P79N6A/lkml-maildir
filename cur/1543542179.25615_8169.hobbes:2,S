Oh, the signal handling changes are fine as outlined in "sys_tgkill()".
That's something simple and straightforward, and has no impact on anything

That is true as long as signals are still a per-thread thing. Which
appears to be ok by POSIX.
It's the shared signals stuff that simply cannot happen right now.
