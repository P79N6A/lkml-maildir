Speaking of bottom halves, I am thinking about a peculiar idea I'd like to
experiment with and am wondering if anyone's fooled around with it already.
That is, to make the entire bottom-half routine preemptible by moving the
do_bottom_half functionality into a kernel thread.  The reason is to allow
greater overall system performance under high softirq-time load, such as
high-speed packet-filtering.  Performance of that stuff in turn would
suffer to some undetermined degree.
Any caveats I would need to watch for?
