As far as the virtual interfaces are configured, this is done via linuxconf with apparently creates these two files ifcfg-eth0:0 and ifcfg-eth0:0 ... the files read as (just for reference):

Is it right ? Why there are so small netmask ? IMO 208.246.162.11 should work
while 208.246.163.22 should NOT work (it's limitation of RedHat's scripts AFAIK,
not kernel).

I probably should've tested the needed things before the heavy upgrade on the machine but I have been running 2.2 at home ever since it was released with zero problems.  So I figured it wouldn't be a big deal ;)
