I think the correct place to start implementing this is in the framework
of the EVMS project (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/evms
).  It is doing
the work of a generalized block-remapping driver for Linux.  They already
have working Linux LVM kernel drivers, along with MS-DOS partition code,
etc.  Adding in the NT dynamic disk remapping would probably be welcome.
