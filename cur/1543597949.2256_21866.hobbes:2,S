Really? Could you point out an example where using ... typeof(x) __x; 
typeof(y) __y; ... in the macros wouldn't work? - I just tried a few 
examples I thought wouldn't work (side-effects ones) but I was pleasantly 
surprised to that gcc always produced the exact same assembler output for 
both the 3 arg and the 2 arg + typeof macros.

Considering the patch removed all occurences of MIN/MAX with the new 3 arg 
min/max macros it wouldn't seem that this would be accepted... )-: 
Otherwise I would submit a patch to switch NTFS. I don't like this 3 arg 
construct...
