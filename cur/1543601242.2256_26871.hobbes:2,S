In my experience you should try to run aide
(
ftp://ftp.cs.tut.fi/pub/src/gnu/aide-0.7.tar.gz
) for tests. This is a case of
one single process doing a file system consistency check and stopping all other
processes cold due to swapout due to heavy cacheing. While aide runs the system
just becomes unusable.
