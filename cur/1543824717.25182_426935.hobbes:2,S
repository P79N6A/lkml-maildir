One of my biggest concerns with the current code is that it is not
sufficiently robust, in the kdump case.  So I am all in favor things
that improve that situation.  At the same time just moving code from C
to assembly doesn't make it more robust, especially when the comments
explaining what the code does don't come along.

Skip the infrastructure changes, and the rest looks like real
possibilities.
