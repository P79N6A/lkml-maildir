Hello,
Why does bdflush (kupdated and kflushed) writes to disk periodically even
though the system is apparently idle.  I think if no more new buffers
becomes dirty, kflushed show not write anything to disk.   I'm working
on a notebook, and I found the periodic disk access is very annoying and
consuming a lot of power.
Thanks!
Joe
