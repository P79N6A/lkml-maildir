Looks pretty decent to me...  minor comments:
* might be a good idea to match defaults with the defaults of the normal 
serial console.  IIRC that's 38400,N,8,1.  which brings up a tangent, 
57600 or 115200 is probably preferred these days, but that requires a 
later patch to update serial console and early serial console to be faster
* VGA base might want to be a variable, though I have not convinced 
myself that such is useful
