spa_svr is my favorite, but as you mentioned doesn't work well with ia.  So I 
started instrumenting its behaviour with chew.c (attached).  What I found is 
that prio-levels are way to coarse.  Setting max_tpt_bonus = 3 bounds this 
somewhat, but it was still not enough.  Looking at spa_svr_reassess_bonus 
and changing it to simply adjust prio based on avg_sleep did the trick like 
this:
static void spa_svr_reassess_bonus(struct task_struct *p)
{
	if (p->sdu.spa.avg_sleep_per_cycle >> 10) {
		incr_throughput_bonus(p, 1);
	} else
		decr_throughput_bonus(p);
}
Thanks!
