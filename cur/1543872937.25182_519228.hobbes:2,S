Allow me to shortly chime in here:
I'm the author of the mpt-status user space tool (a simple alternative 
to your Java GUI tool), which queries LSI controllers and reports back 
the RAID status and the synchronization state; so I have waded through 
the driver source code quite a lot. My question:

I would really like to see "sanitized" kernel headers, so is it possible 
to have your headers inside ../drivers/message/fusion{,/lsi} somehow 
inserted into the process of the headers_install target?
