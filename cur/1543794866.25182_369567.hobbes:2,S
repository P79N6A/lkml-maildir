I seem to have some problems getting the serial console to work, but 
in the mean time I have some more results, this time using a UP 
kernel (again without MSI and libata DEBUG):
1. several badblocks tests finished fine; the speed is also fine 
(about 50Mbytes/s both read and write as reported by both iostat 
during badblocks and bonnie++ on an ext2 FS).
2. I know that we are not yet talking about hotplugging, but this 
is what happens if you do it (unplug) :-)

The acpi_* stuff might be due to the fact that this interrupt is taken 
over first by ACPI and later assigned also to sata_mv; this happens 
only with the UP kernel, for the SMP kernel sata_mv did not share the 
interrupt.
