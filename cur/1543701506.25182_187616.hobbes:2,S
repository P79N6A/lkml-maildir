My suspicion is that Tomas is right - and that something changed in gcc
between 3.3 and 3.3.2, to affectively remove the sign compare warning
from -Wall.
I will look into that more carefully now.
If so, then:
  1) The alternative to my patch would be telling everyone to not use
     gcc 3.3 or 3.3.1.
  2) On the other hand, my patch would still be desirable on the
     grounds that it makes gcc 3.3 and 3.3.1 usable for kernel builds,
     and is essentially a no-op otherwise, for kernel builds.
I'll post again after I compare some gcc code.
