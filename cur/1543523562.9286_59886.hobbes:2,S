Is that a mean that I should prepare my badget for a new drive?&nbsp;
Any comments or suggestions would be more than welcome.</pre>

<p><br>Hmm ... have you tried turning on the uhmm ... darn .. there is
a compile switch in the kernel config for multi-mode IDE that produces
real similar errors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could be your drive though or file system
corruption.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Can anyone explain why 2.2.14 even with the ATA66 and DVD&nbsp;patches
and UDF patches =STILL= keeps telling me that I have some sort of invalid
media in my DVD&nbsp;ROM when I stick a DVD&nbsp;into it??&nbsp; CDs work
fine, and it seems to be the kernel doing it.&nbsp; The error repeats to
the console constantly, about once a second I think.&nbsp; This is VERY&nbsp;VERY&nbsp;bad
since I&nbsp;used a fixed frequency monitor so my console is a vt240 (original
dec green screen vt240 that can barely keep up with 19200 bps).&nbsp; The
constant writing of data to the serial port seems to slow down the system
considerably and the mouse will get real jumpy and unusable - which seems
very wrong to me - the system shouldn't come down on its knees just cause
of a log to a file and serial port at once a second when drive is super
fast, I&nbsp;got RAM to spare, and a 500Mhz processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why
the error message, and why does it kill the system?&nbsp; Of course - simple
solution - take out the DVD.
<p>2.3.36 seems to work ok, but there are other issues with running a 2.3.x
kernel.&nbsp; I want everything without rebooting - DVDs, TV, VMware, Wine,
DosEMU, and everything else I&nbsp;can think of.
<p>While I'm at the subject of drives.&nbsp; Any clue why I can't select
my ls120 as a floppy or ide device under vmware?&nbsp; Also, shouldn't
the kernel auto-sync when closing a removeable media device?&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp;get tired of typing 'sync' a couple times after doing a tar -czf
/dev/fd0&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an eject on close, how about
a sync on close?&nbsp; Or sync+eject on close when opened for writing only
(reading the disk I&nbsp;don't care, but after writing something I usually
wanna sync and eject it).
<p>Shouldn't any opens on /dev/fd0 (a symlink to /dev/hdd - my ls120) look
like a floppy to whoever opened the device?&nbsp;&nbsp; Any clue where
the interface is different, and can the ATAPI&nbsp;FLOPPY&nbsp;driver be
modified to look more like a regular floppy device (at least when I have
a regular floppy in there).&nbsp; Trying to get nextstep installed under
vmware.
<p>Any answers please email me direct as I only read the list infrequently
(meaning when I should be working but nothing is broken right now and I&nbsp;don't
feel like breaking anything).
