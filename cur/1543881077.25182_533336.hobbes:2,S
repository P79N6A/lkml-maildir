I just saw that we already have an option like that, with a slightly different
name.
arch/s390/Kconfig contains
config NO_IOMEM
	def_bool y
and lib/Kconfig contains
config HAS_IOMEM
	boolean
	depends on !NO_IOMEM
	default y
You should probably just use one of these two to disable any driver that
uses ioremap or similar.
