The lock on the bus is _necessary_ in SMP. It would be very bad if each
incl would implicitly do a lock on the bus. It would forbid you to use
incl in SMP for single threaded code (for example inside critical
sections).
Even if it would lock on the bus it wouldn't matter. C only knows about
signle threading. So as far as C is concerned it's fine if it doesn't use
incl for incrementing volatile variables IMHO.
