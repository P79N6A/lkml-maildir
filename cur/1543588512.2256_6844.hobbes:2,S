Again with due respect, you haven't gotten it yet.  In fact, you've
got it exactly backwards.  Unsurprising -- you're so magnificently
well adapted to the way things are that certain limiting assumptions
of the system you operate in have become invisible to you.
What you call a rare case is rare not because it *should* be rare but because
the work practices and social mechanisms of lkml combine to heavily discourage
improvements that cross jurisdictional boundaries.  
This is a *problem*.  I won't belabor the point, because I am certain
that you'll believe the conclusion more if you figure it out yourself than
if I tell you.  Hint: think about long-term coherency issues in large
codebases.  Think hard.
