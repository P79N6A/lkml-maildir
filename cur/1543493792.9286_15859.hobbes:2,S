The parent _does_ have them, in pI.

Any useful system allows a full range of behavior, from lenient to strict.
The system I proposed would calculate both lenient and strict values,
grant the strict values, and then add a configurable set of bits from
the lenient values.

That is _less_ secure, because damn near everything needs to have bits
set in fP.
The other proposal (mark the parent, so that bits are dropped from pI)
is much easier to use and more compatible.
