Agh, you're right.  I fixed that in the 2.3 branch but not the 2.2
branch.  I'll re-release e2compr patches for 2.2.8 upwards this
afternoon.  The only change is to remove all e2compr changes to
fs/binfmt_elf.c and fs/binfmt_aout.c.
(The change is still needed for arch/sparc64/kernel/binfmt_aout32.c,
though; for some reason Linus/Dave didn't fix that at the same time as
fixing fs/binfmt_[ae]*.)
pjm.
