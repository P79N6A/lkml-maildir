I just concluded that buying anything with the word VIA on it is a 
spectacularly bad idea.

Ah yes, if it's explicit, never mind the VT8235/37 thing then.

It'll mean that the problem will be much less visible and as such you might 
not get (as) many new testers anymore to get to the root problem so if one 
of the current reporters can test somewhat freely, this would probably be 
the time...
But I'll just stick with my NEC controller now and consider myself not 
interested anymore :-)
