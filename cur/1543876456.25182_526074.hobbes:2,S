I haven't gotten that far yet.  A gentleman named Dave Dillow has shown me 
how to demo the problem using only tar in a scripting environment, and it 
is repeatable on a per kernel good or bad basis.
So far, the only difference that I'm seeing is in the Device: line of a 
stat . report, that first number of that line changes from good kernel to 
bad kernel.
From another email I sent Dave an hour or so ago:
For a good kernel, 2.6.20.3-rdsl-0.31:
[root@coyote bad-kernel]# cd /usr/music
[root@coyote music]# stat .
  File: `.'
  Size: 4096            Blocks: 16         IO Block: 4096   directory

Now rebooted to 2.6.21-rc5:
[root@coyote ~]# cd /usr/music
[root@coyote music]# stat .
  File: `.'
  Size: 4096            Blocks: 16         IO Block: 4096   directory

What is this difference in the Device: line supposed to mean?
And are we 'getting warmer' here?
Thanks.
