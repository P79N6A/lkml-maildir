That is generally not true. Pe-emption is used in user space to prevent
applications doing very stupid things. Pre-emption in a trusted environment
can often be most efficient if done by the programs themselves.
Userspace is not a trusted environment

Andrew's patches give you 1mS worst case latency for normal situations, that
is below human perception, and below scheduling granularity. In other words
without the efficiency loss and the debugging problems you can place the
far enough latency below other effects that it isnt worth attacking any more.
