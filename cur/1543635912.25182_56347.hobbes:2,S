No, I think I was mistaken. The manual is for more models than the
specific one I own. Sorry about the confusion. Here is /proc/cpuinfo
anyway:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 1
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.70GHz

hlt_bug         : no

I bought it about a month ago. I have only tested ACPI briefly.
Activating it in a standard 2.4 kernel doesn't work very well (battery
status not available, lots of errors in dmesg during boot.) I haven't
tested the latest patches from Intel yet.
