No, I'm not sure.  I think the problem is likely in VMWare. But I don't
mind fixing the symptom if it allows me to recover without a reboot.  
I'm using Linux in production systems and even when something like this
goes wrong I want to recover gracefully.  An equivalent in other
subsystems is the work of the NFS group to resolve inconsistancies that
creep into network mount tables.
