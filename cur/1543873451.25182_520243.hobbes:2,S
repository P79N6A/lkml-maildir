Subject: [PATCH take3 00/20] Make common x86 arch area for i386 and x86_64 - Take 3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Once again here's an attempt to put the shared files of x86_64 and i386
into a separate directory.
This time, I took the pains to make sure that each patch in this
series compiles after it is applied.  I did this on both x86_64 as well
as i386, with the affected files config options turned on.
I still stayed away from the pci shared code.
This time I moved the speedstep-lib.h into include/asm-x86. Although all
references to this files now needs to explicitly state
 #include <asm-x86/speedstep-lib.h>
But this will also create a doorway for other shared headers to go
into.
And yes the long term goal is to perhaps make a single arch that can
handle both the i386 modern CPUs as well as the x86_64 code. And then
phase out the x86_64, keeping the current i386 for legacy hardware.
Used git-diff -M for the diffs, so the renames are explicitly stated
as such, but no delete/create diff is made (so patch and quilt will
not apply theses).
Comments and flames welcome.
