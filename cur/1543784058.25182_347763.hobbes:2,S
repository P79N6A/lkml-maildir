I've already included below patch from you.
It was included in -linus last night.
Do we really need more?

    kbuild: Don't fail if include/asm symlink exists
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    We're having the following situation: There are user-space applications
    that include kernel headers directly. With a completely unconfigured
    /usr/src/linux tree, including most headers fails because essential
    files are not there:
    
    	include/asm
    	include/linux/autoconf.h
    	include/linux/version.h
    
    So we create these files. On the other hand, we want to use
    /usr/src/linux as read-only source for building kernels or additional
    modules. Now when building a kernel with a separate output directory
    (O=), there is a check in the main makefile for the include/asm symlink.
    There is no real need for this check: if we ensure that
    $(objdir)/include/asm is always created as the patch does,
    $(srctree)/include/asm becomes irrelevant.
