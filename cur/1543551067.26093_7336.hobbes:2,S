If the oom killer kills a thing like init by mistake or init has a memleak
you'll notice both problems regardless of having a magic for init in a _very_
slow path so I don't buy your point.
.
For corretness init must not be killed ever, period.
So you have two choices:
o	math proof that the current algorithm without the magic can't end
	killing init (and I should be able to proof the other way around
	instead)
o	have a magic check for init
So the magic is _strictly_ necessary at the moment.
