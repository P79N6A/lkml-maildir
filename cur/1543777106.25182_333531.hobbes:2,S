I've tested as you suggest :
- Disabled USB 2.0 in BIOS
- Renamed ehci_hcd.ko so that modprobe can't find it
- Booted the test-patched kernel with same options as previously, MOUSE 
UNPLUGGED.
- After boot "cat /proc/interrupts" shows "0" count for IRQ 21
- Nothing special isn't logged anymore in dmesg or /var/log/messages.
- Plugging / unplugging the mouse or other devices doesn't cause anything 
visible to happen. Nothing gets logged, IRQ 21 counter stays at 0. I could as 
well not have done it ;-)

Well, so that's a pretty clear indication, but surely clearer to you than to 
me ;-)
So, what's up, doc ? ;-))
