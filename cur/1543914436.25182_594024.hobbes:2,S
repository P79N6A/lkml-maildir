Net driver patches should apply on top of netdev-2.6.git#upstream, which 
is where changes to net drivers are queued for the next release.
The closer we get to the merge window, the greater the diff between 
netdev-2.6.git#upstream and linux-2.6.git#master, so 
linux-2.6.git#master is not a useful comparison.
