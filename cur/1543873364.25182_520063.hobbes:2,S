Well, at some point Xen is going to be 64-bit.  We need a 64-bit
paravirt_ops, and it looks to me that 90% of the entrypoints will be
more or less identical for 32 and 64 bit x86, so it would be unfortunate
to not share it.
The existing technique for sharing stuff between 32 and 64 bits is
pretty damn ugly, and I think Steven is on to something with this
patch.  Though I'm definitely sympathetic to the concern that it will
break a pile of outstanding patches.
