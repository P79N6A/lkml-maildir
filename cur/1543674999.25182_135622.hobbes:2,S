Hello,
I encountered a Kernel oops on two different PCs, both a configured
identical. The system uses an ISDN connection to an Internet ISP and then
establishes a VPN tunnel based on PPTP.
As far as I can see in /var/log/messages the problem occurred on both
system at the same time at 00:15, but not at the same day and not every
day. No special program is running at that time. Basically it is a SuSE 7.3
distribution, I made a Kernel upgrade.
Hardware is a Fujitsu Siemens N300 PC with an IDE (7200 Rpm), Intel 845GI
Motherboard, an ISDN PBX connected via USB to dial-up, the connection
wasn't established when the system oopsed.
Attached are some information.
