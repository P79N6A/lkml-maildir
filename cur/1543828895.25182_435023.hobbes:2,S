OK, at 
http://lisas.de/~andi/temp_usb/
 there are logs:
debug.log.gz: burning, then running my open() test app: test app started
at 22:43:49, disrupted burning process.
only_device_open.log.gz: device open() *only* (plus close()!),
no other USB activity such as burning happening (for comparison purposes, to see
what a usual open()/close() is like)
only_device_open.log.gz (and close()!) contains:
- TEST_UNIT_READY (failure?)
- TEST_UNIT_READY
- TEST_UNIT_READY
- READ_TOC (failure?)
- ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL
- (unknown command) !!!!!!!
- TEST_UNIT_READY
- READ_TOC (failure?)
- READ_TOC (failure?)
- READ_CAPACITY
- ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL
Hmm, multiple failures in there: might be cable issues??
debug.log.gz contains:
*** ongoing burning: ***
- lots of WRITE_10 (NO failure!)
- READ BUFFER CAPACITY
- lots of WRITE_10 (NO failure!)
- READ BUFFER CAPACITY
- a couple WRITE_10 (NO failure!)
*** [22:43:49] device open(): ***
- TEST_UNIT_READY (ok!)
- WRITE_10 (ok!!)
- TEST_UNIT_READY (ok!)
- WRITE_10 (ok!)
- READ_TOC (*** ERROR!! ***)
- WRITE_10 (ok!)
- ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL (ok!)
- WRITE_10 (*** FAILURE! ***)
- going downhill from here...
So what could be the problem here?
READ_TOC might be it, but then it might be fully ok to have it fail
(after all it's non-valid data content), so ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL would be the
problem then? (next WRITE_10 FAILS!).
I could be totally wrong, though, since I don't have much storage debugging
experience.
A good idea would be to further check whether it's the open() or the close()
which disrupts burning for me.

I'd like to, but can't since I don't have device access any more.
Oh, and that burner_switchoff_oops.jpg in the same directory
is an OOPS that happened when I tried to blank a CDRW,
then cancelled the operation (2x Ctrl-C on cdrecord),
but then had HAL device polling daemon and my test app block on I/O wait on the
device that continued blanking the CDRW. Since I then didn't want to wait
for the blanking to finish I had to switch off the device: immediate OOPS,
possibly due to mis-handling the two processes still waiting on a busy device
which then got switched off completely. Kernel 2.6.17-rc6-mm2.
Thanks!
