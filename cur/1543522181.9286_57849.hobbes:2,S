     I won't lie and say it makes sense to me, why it's implimented as a system
call on one architecture, library function on another, etc, and why there is no
distinction. 
     From my vantage point it would just seem to make troubleshooting a real
bitch.
     Kernel is maintained by one group of people, libc by another.  Now it is
less of a mystery to me why there are so many conflicts and things out of sync.
