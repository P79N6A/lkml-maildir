Hi Jens,
I'm facing a data corruption problem with splice() between two
non-blocking TCP sockets on 2.6.27.10. I could finally write a
simpler proof of concept, and capture a snapshot of the issue
with the associated strace result.
My program does the following :
  - accept an incoming connection
  - connect to a remote server
  - forward all data from the server to the client using splice()
The data count is always correct, but some parts are corrupted and
contain data which seem to come from random memory locations (this
raises a security concern BTW). It *sometimes* happens that a few
megabytes can be transferred without any problem, but most of the
time, corruption happens for a few hundreds of bytes every few
hundreds of kilobytes.
I first noticed that sometimes the corrupted part sized a multiple of
the MSS. But now it's more precise. Each time I observe the problem,
it is when the splice from the pipe to the outgoing socket has sent
two chunks at once.
For my test, I run my PoC program on my laptop. I connect to it using
netcat from localhost, then it connects to another machine on which
netcat is waiting for an incoming connection. The source of gcc-4.1.2
is then feed on stdin, and transferred via my program to the client-
side netcat. Both NICs are tg3, but the problem was first observed
with ixgbe NICs, then reproduced on sky2, so I don't think there's a
relation.
Here's an example of what I observed. This trace is really nice
because the problem happened very early (after about 14kB). 20k1 is an
"od -vAx -tx1" output of the original file, 20k2 is an output of the
corrupted one :

As you can see, the first corrupted byte starts at offset 0x3754 =
14164 and the corruption remains for 172 bytes.
Now let's take a look at the strace output :
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4000), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
listen(3, 10)                           = 0
accept(3, 0, NULL)                      = 4
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 5
connect(5, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4001), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.1.1.1")}, 16) = 0
fcntl64(4, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 0
fcntl64(5, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 0
pipe([6, 7])                            = 0
select(6, [5], [], NULL, NULL)          = 1 (in [5])
splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1024
select(6, [5], [4], NULL, NULL)         = 2 (in [5], out [4])
splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1460

splice(0x6, 0, 0x4, 0, 0xb68, 0x3)      = 2920
==> at this point, exactly 14164 bytes have been transferred from the
    server to the client, ie exactly the amount of data before the
    corruption.
select(6, [5], [], NULL, NULL)          = 1 (in [5])
splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 172
==> we have a read of 172 bytes, exactly the number of corrupted bytes. 
select(6, [5], [4], NULL, NULL)         = 2 (in [5], out [4])
splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1460
splice(0x6, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x660, 0x3)      = 1632
==> and here, we write the last two chunks at once and the reader
    observes random data for the first chunk.
select(6, [5], [], NULL, NULL)          = 1 (in [5])
splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1460

splice(0x5, 0, 0x7, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1460
splice(0x6, 0, 0x4, 0, 0xb68, 0x3)      = 2920
...
I tried to replace either socket with a file, and in both cases, the
problem disappears (which explains why we have not seen reports of
corruption on sendfile). So it's really between TCP and TCP the the
problem lies.
I tried to disable SPLICE_F_MOVE, it did not change anything.
Disabling SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK makes the code unusable as it blocks when
the pipe is full, while the same process is supposed to flush it.
It looks like the corruption happens between sockets and/or pipes,
because the first time it was noticed on a production system, the
system was running haproxy (reverse-proxy load-balancer), and we found
multiple copies of request and response headers in a data file. I
don't know however if those were from other active splices or from
earlier ones running on the same FDs.
Also, it's very hard to reproduce the problem under strace, so I feel
really lucky to have caught this trace. I think it's just a timing
problem.
Another method I found to quickly detect corruption is to feed
/dev/zero to netcat on the server side, and pipe the output to "od",
which will only show sequences of non-zeroes. Hmm just did it right
now again and I got a complete capture of the output of the "top"
utility that I just started in another window.
At first, I thought that blocking reads when there are data in the
pipe would make the problem go away, but it's not the case. I modified
my program to stop polling for reads when "bytes" is not null, and I
finally got on my socket a complete output of strace running in
another xterm.
I found an analysis [1] for a potential corruption problem between two
sockets, but I noticed there were no responses and I did not fully
understand the report anyway.
What can I do to help debug the problem ? I'm really willing to help
getting this fixed, and I also have at least one user who definitely
wants splice() to work because the recv/send model currently limits
haproxy to 3 Gbps on his machines, while I have no problem reaching
10 Gbps with splice().
Please find the attached program. The server's address is hard-coded
to 10.1.1.1:4001. It accepts connections on port 4000. Here's how you
can try to reproduce :
# server :
# nc -lp 4000 </dev/zero
# test machine :
# ./splice-net-to-net
# test machine (again) :
# nc 127.1 4000 | od -Ax -tx1
If you don't get the problem, start strace on splice-net-to-net, here
it seems to help (probably the timing race again).
Thanks in advance,
Willy
