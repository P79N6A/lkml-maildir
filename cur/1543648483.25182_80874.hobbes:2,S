Filesystem capabilities move complexity out of applications into the file 
system (=system configuration), so the admins have to deal with an additional 
task.
From a security point of view suid root applications that are dropping 
capabilities voluntarily aren't much different from plain old suid root apps; 
there may still be exploitable bugs before the code that drops capabilities 
(which doesn't mean that apps shouldn't drop capabilities). With capabilities 
the kernel ensures that applications cannot exceed their capabilities.
I think the remaining questions really are:
	- how to populate the database of capabilities needed by apps.
	  (Pavel Machek has started this as part of elfcap [which is a bad
	  idea], see 
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/caps/capbase.txt
)
	- how to make maintaining / monitoring tight capabilities as
	  effortless as possible.
	- how to set up capabilities when users log in (which users are
	  granted which capabilities; this can be used to split up the role
	  of root.)
	- (maybe some more)

Well perhaps not, the admin gets overloaded with requests/complaints, and 
finally decides to discard FS caps.

It's worse if apps stop dropping capabilities and instead rely on the caller.
