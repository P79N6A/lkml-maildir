Unfortunately I dont have a serial port on the hardware either...
It was very poorly designed... (IMO)  I will try linking /dev/console
to dev null or the patch I was sent to do "console=null".  Hopefully
this will work.
Oh and BTW... I did not have this problem with a 2.0.x kernel.  Was
any of the conesole code changed?  Currently I have the problem with
2.3.40+ I have not tested anything else. (No 2.2.x kernels)
Thanks,
Mike
