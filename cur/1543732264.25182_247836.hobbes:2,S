Hi Steven,

To be honest, this does look interesting, however could you help me on a 
few points:
  - Is there any evil IP we have to worry about with this?
  - Can I get a formal interface spec from AIS for this, without
    signing a license?
  - Have you got benchmarks available for control and normal messaging?
  - Have you looked at the barrier subsystem in sources.redhat.com/dlm?
    Could this be used as a primitive in implementing Virtual Synchrony?
  - Why would we need to worry about the AIS spec, in-kernel?  What
    would stop you from providing an interface that presented some
    kernel functionality to userspace, with the interface of your
    choice, presumably AIS?
  - Why isn't Virtual Synchrony overkill, since we don't attempt to
    deal with netsplits by allowing subclusters to continue to operate?
  - In what way would GFS benefit from using Virtual Synchrony in place
    of its current messaging algorithms?
Regards,
Daniel
