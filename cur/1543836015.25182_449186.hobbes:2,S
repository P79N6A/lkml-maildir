Open, fork and write from both processes. This needs a semaphore

Should have cpu_relax() and really ought to have a timeout in case it
fails. In fact it needs one or a barrier as you are using __raw and that
may not reload if the compiler is overclever.

Ditto - open, fork write the close sequence in parallel on both ?

Races an open occuring when misc_register is done and before we hit
wdt_disable.
