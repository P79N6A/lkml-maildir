yep, this can be done via the chaff utility i posted:
	gcc -c module.c & ./chaff $! 0x6
or, it can be done by changing the affinity of the current shell, every
new child process will inherit it:
	./chaff $$ 0x6; gcc -c module.c
(or a cpuselect utility can be written.)

yep, this is how sched_set_affinity() is workig - it allows the setting of
affinities if either CAP_SYS_NICE is set, or the process' uid/gid matches
that of the target process' effective uid/gid.
