Rather than changing LOAD_OFFSET in Linux, why not leave this alone and 
change the Xen domain builder to properly interpret the ELF program 
header fields?
i.e. with this change, we'd have
p_paddr = __PAGE_OFFSET + segment_offset
p_vaddr = __PAGE_OFFSET + segment_offset
VIRT_BASE = __PAGE_OFFSET
where, the VA mapping p_paddr -> (p_paddr-VIRT_BASE) is established by 
the domain builder.
Instead, why not drop this patch, and the VIRT_BASE portion of the 
__xen_guest section, and instead change Xen's domain builder to treat 
p_paddr and p_vaddr in a more standard way?  Since Xen starts the domain 
with virtual address management enabled, it makes sense for it to use 
p_vaddr to determine the virtual address to load the kernel to.  Then, 
p_paddr could be used to determine which pseudo-physical pages back that 
virtual address range.
i.e. use, just like vanilla linux:
p_paddr = segment_offset
p_vaddr = __PAGE_OFFSET + segment_offset
so these two fields directly indicate the same mapping as before, but 
now in terms of p_vaddr -> p_paddr, which makes sense, and no need for 
the extra VIRT_BASE attribute in the __xen_guest section.
