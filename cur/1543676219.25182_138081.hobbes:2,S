But that would have changed the way that pci_for_each_dev() works.  It
would require that dev=NULL before the function is called.  And having
the same function work subtly different on different kernel versions
would not be the best thing.  Getting rid of it entirely was the better
option, and now that Linus has pulled it, we don't have to worry about
it anymore :)
