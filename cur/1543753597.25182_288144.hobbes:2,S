I suppose there is one case (not introduced by the patch).  Not sure if
it's even a problem though:
t->cmd matches, yet NULL t->handler.  This will fall-thru to
the do_ioctl: case.  I assume NULL handler is for case where no
conversion is needed, so it's not a problem?  At least some callers of
register_ioctl32_conversion() pass NULL handler.
thanks,
