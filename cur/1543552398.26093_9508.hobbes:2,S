This is typical of the "linux mentality". Why do other OSs have solutions 
that work, yet linux's method requires special coding? If it "has to be 
done that way", why do other OS's have solutions that dont do it that way? 
the size of the buffer is an annoyance but not a serious problem however.
printing directly to the console (as BSD does) is useful when debugging a 
panic, as you can trace right to the panic point. Also certain levels of 
output will trash the screen, requiring a reset (switching to another 
virtual console and then switching back, unfortunately flushing the buffer 
will do it). Im not sure if it has been fixed, but also writing without a 
newline used to cause garbage to be spewed to the screen, which meant a 
screen line had to be used for each message.

I never use development kernels, what Im talking about is each major 
release is like starting from version 1.0. By the time it stabilizes, the 
next major puts it back to square one.
My point is that there is no "stable kernel series". 2.2.0 wasnt stable, 
and neither was 2.2.3. Virtually all of the ethernet drivers still lock up 
under heavy load in 2.2.17...and now with 2.4 there are more countless 
adventures ahead....
an example of "poor planning" is that skput and skpush will panic the 
kernel if there is no room (this can happen with multiple encapsulations) 
The proper behaviour would be to return a NULL pointer indicating failure, 
and then to drop the frame and issue a warning. But, as AC says "we cant 
rewrite every driver and it would be inefficient to check every 
transaction". However the only way around it is to check the headroom 
before you call skput and reallocate the skbuff if there is no room, which 
seems a bit more inefficient. In effect, there is a lingering "bug" that is 
just tough noogies if it affects  you.
