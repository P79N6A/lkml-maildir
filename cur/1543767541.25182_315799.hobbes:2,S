FWIW, I can reproduce this timer bug fairly consistently, by simply 
rebooting my cisco router.  That means that my linux box has no default 
gateway, and hence the networking blows up within about 30s and dies 
with a stack trace which has references to timers.
I'll back out those three patches and see if it continues, but hopefully 
my little discovery is useful to someone in terms of coming up with a 
fix....
Box is an Intel 2.8/SMP
