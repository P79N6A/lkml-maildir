hm, do we know it for a fact that the 40% AIM regression is due to the 
fastpath overhead of the BKL? It would be extraordinary if so.
I think it is far more likely that it's due to the different scheduling 
and wakeup behavior of the new kernel/semaphore.c code. So the fix would 
be to restore the old scheduling behavior - that's what Yanmin's manual 
revert did and that's what got him back the previous AIM7 performance.
