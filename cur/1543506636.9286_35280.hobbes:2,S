	GRuB is now a GNU software, you can find at
http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.en.html.
Its main capability is the command line, available before any OS is
loaded : it can read ext2fs, BSDish and FAT partitions, has file
completion, ...
The last version is 5.95 and have some improvements (like colors !).
