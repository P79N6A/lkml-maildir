I must admit your results are strange to say the least, the only
explanation that I can think of at the moment is that you have been
running LVM1.
Just to reassure me that this is not the case, can you please make
sure that the LVM1 driver is not available, and that your path are not
picking up old LVM1 tools by mistake.  There was a time when the tools
were installed in /usr/sbin rather than /sbin.
