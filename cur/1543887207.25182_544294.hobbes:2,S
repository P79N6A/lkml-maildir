Subject: [PATCH 0/5] make slab gfp fair

In the interest of creating a reserve based allocator; we need to make the slab
allocator (*sigh*, all three) fair with respect to GFP flags.
That is, we need to protect memory from being used by easier gfp flags than it
was allocated with. If our reserve is placed below GFP_ATOMIC, we do not want a
GFP_KERNEL allocation to walk away with it - a scenario that is perfectly
possible with the current allocators.
