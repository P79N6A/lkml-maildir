Exactly .. and on the topic of the hardware being reverse engineered ..
there's at least one software product I know of, (commercially) available
which makes the reverse engineering processes much easier, and even goes as
far as creating driver skeletons for the hardware you want to create a
driver for (for windows and linux.. and all you need to know is which device
in your system you want to work with)

This is probably the best reason .. look at how long it takes some companies
to even produce a beta version of a driver for their new product (creative
labs with the sblive, and adaptec with their new raid series).... I
understand that, for instance, in the case of Adaptec with their new quad
channel raid controllers, they wouldn't want to release an open source
version of their drivers, because they actually charge for the ddk...  but
on the other-hand, its taking forever for them to produce a driver, and now
release it.. What's worse, is when they do release it, its being released in
binary only format .. Now how do you mount the root filesystem off the raid,
when the driver isn't loaded yet because you need to mount the root
filesystem to get at the driver? and you don't want to be stuck with a
single kernel (ie, 2.2.5 which they may release in binary form only, with
the driver built in)... all because they charge a couple bucks for the ddk
and won't open source the linux driver.
