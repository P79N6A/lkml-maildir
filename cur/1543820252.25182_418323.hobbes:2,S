Hi,
I have a Sony Vaio running Fedora Core 3 (Kernel version 2.6). For some 
reason, often the laptop just hangs and the kernel panics. The panic 
messages captured are:
Process xinetd (pid: 2123, threadinfo=023d4000 task=1f20f370)
Stack: 023d4fd0 06350d40 02350d40 00000000 00000011 023fa5a8 0000000a 
00000000 02124f09 1fc91f40 00000046 023d5000 021096ee
Call Trace:
Stack Pointer in garbage, not printing trace
Code: Bad EIP value.
kernel/timer.c:194: spin_lock(kernel/timer.c:02350760) already locked 
by kernel/timer.c/439
Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
It would be great help if someone could please tell what might have 
possibly gone wrong with my system.
Thanks
Shallu
