There is one more place except the r8169 driver where gcc 2.95.3 is bad. 
To reproduce the problem:
(you will need HJL Binutils >= 2.14.90.0.8 and gcc 3.3.x)
Check out a known good glibc from CVS:
cvs -z 3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/glibc \
     export -d glibc-2.3.4-20040510 -D "14:45:00 2004-05-10 UTC" libc
sed -i -e "s/stable/2004-05-10/" -e "s/2\.3\.3/2.3.4/" \
     glibc-2.3.4-20040510/version.h
Alternatively, there is a tarball available (created with these 
instructions) which you can download from the following location: 
ftp://gaosu.rave.org/pub/linux/lfs/packages/conglomeration/glibc-2.3.4-20040510.tar.bz2
Build glibc:
cd glibc-2.3.4-20040510
mkdir ../glibc-build
cd ../glibc-build
../glibc-2.3.4-20040510/configure --prefix=/usr \
     --disable-profile --enable-add-ons=nptl --with-tls \
     --without-cvs \
     --with-headers=/usr/src/linux/include
make
(we will not install anything)
Back up the glibc-build directory for future reference, but don't remove 
it now.
Issue the "make ckeck" command when running linux-2.6.6 compiled with 
gcc 3.3.3. If you get a failure, make a note of it and reissue the "make 
check" command.
Once you know all failures, remove the glibc-build directory and restore 
it from the backup you made previously.
Reboot into linux-2.6.6 compiled with gcc-2.95.3 published by Free 
Software Foundation. Redo the tests. You will notice several additional 
errors in NPTL testsuite. That's why I think that linux-2.6.6 should 
never be compiled with gcc-2.95.3.
