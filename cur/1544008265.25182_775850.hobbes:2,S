Once a day seems like a good value to me.  It's a good human being
timescale and still cuts down the number of atime updates by a lot.
If somebody really cares, they could graph the relatime_update value
against number of writes performed in a given period and determine a
better cutoff.  I can think of a hundred better ways to spend my time
though.
Good job of not answering the question, by the way.  Why _not_ 24 hours?
