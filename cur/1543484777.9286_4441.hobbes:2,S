Saw the recent STB video discussion in the archives.  I recently aquired a
STB Desktop TV card.  FM/TV Tuner.  BT878 based.
Heres the thing.  video4linux finds it fine, and I get good video.  But no
matter what I do I get no sound.  
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: bttv0: Brooktree Bt878 (rev 2) bus: 0,
devfn: 160, irq: 11, memory: 0xe1002000.
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device
00:a0
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: bttv0: audio chip: TDA9850
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: bttv0: model: BT878(STB)
Feb  7 01:58:25 tacorp kernel: i2c: bus registered: bt848-0
That is what I get at started.  It seems as if the TDA9850 chip is in a
"mute" mode.
Any suggestions?
