Make sure that you have enabled CONFIG_KALLSYMS, and that
/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq is set to one.  Then, when it hangs, do
	echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger
or type alt-sysrq-t
Then, run
	dmesg -s 1000000 > /tmp/foo
and make `foo' available.
It would help if you could make a note of the PIDs of the hung processes,
so they can be correlated with the sysrq output.
Thanks.
