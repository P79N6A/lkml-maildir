They're keys that generate scancodes through the keyboard controller. 
Not having them go through the input layer requires actively forcing 
them into some other route, which seems excessive.

There's no advantage in having to implement multiple solutions. If we're 
stuck with one of them, we might as well just use it for the other cases 
as well.

No, these aren't ACPI keys and the machines don't provide backlight 
control through ACPI. It's not a problem with more recent Dells, but 
machines before mid-2006 or so have this issue.
