Subject: 2.2.9 on bzdisk fails to complete booting

This is a fairly old machine, with a 486/120 and 32M RAM.  Currently, I
have the stock RH 2.2.5-15 kernel installed, with RH6.0.  It boots fine
off the bootdisk I made during installation.  I have to use bzdisk for
some reason, as the BIOS refuses to see LILO in the boot sector, maybe
due to I/O card problems?  But that's a separate issue.
Anyhow, I compiled the kernel to run this box as a masq box, and it
compiled fine.  No errors, etc.  When it boots, it loads/uncompresses
the kernel, loads drivers, etc.  When it reaches the "Freeing unused
kernel memory" it freezes.  It looks like it's trying to free 36K. 
2.2.5 generally frees 60K of memory, FWIW.  I'm not sure how/if I can
capture what's going on to a file for further analysis.
Any ideas would be welcome.
