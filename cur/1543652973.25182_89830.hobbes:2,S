USB hardware and protocols are master-slave, meaning that you can not
connect another computer to this one directly. What USB *device* would
you want to see connected?
Of course, a USB-Serial adapter would work, and you can connect any
serial terminal, but then we are back to using serial ports; it's just
you will need a different driver for that.
