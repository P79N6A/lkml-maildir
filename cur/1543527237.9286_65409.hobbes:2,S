gcc may generate memcpy/memset calls internally (common on several architectures,
quite uncommon on Intel). I've sent a test case to Jan Hubicka for a case
where gcc generates a memset call internally (it was initializing a
local structure variable, which included a char array and in the initializer
was set with a string of a shorter length, like:
struct foo {
char name[20];
};
void bar(struct foo *);
void baz(void) {
struct foo f = { "short" };
bar(&f);
}
). IMHO it is a bug in gcc because for this case the clearing does not go
through standard mechanisms which would generate ia32 builtins, and as it is
rather rare, kernel does not export memcpy/memset symbols at all on i386
(unlike some other ports).
Cheers,
