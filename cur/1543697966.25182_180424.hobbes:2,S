Subject: [PATCH] VERSION 2: fs/locks.c fcntl_setlease did not check if a file was opened for writing before granting a read lease
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

> Sorry, it won't work.
Then try this.  A half-@$$ed patch is better than no patch at all.
