Well the above was a stupid comment made on purpose to cynically depict the
current situation.  But this answer from you just shows that you don't
necessarily ignore stupid comments...
It just looks like you are failing to obtain guidance from Linus so _maybe_
submiting multiple small patches that can be reviewed from within a mailer
might be easier for someone who already stated his preferences for that
matter.
No offense intended. Really.
