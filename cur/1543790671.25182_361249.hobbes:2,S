I'm upgrading a box from 2.4.23 to .31, but I'm seeing lots of errors
along these lines:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.31/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   
-nostdinc -iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=tty_ioctl
-DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c tty_ioctl.c

The redefinition of "set_cpus_allowed" and "del_timer_sync" only happen
when CONFIG_SMP isn't set.  
I guess I could simply compile with CONFIG_SMP, but surely something's
not right here?
Follow-up:
OK, I've built the kernel with SMP support, and I'm not seeing the above 
any longer. However, when I tried to load module nfsd, I get:
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o: unresolved symbol 
kernel_flag_cacheline
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o: unresolved symbol 
atomic_dec_and_lock
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o: insmod 
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.o: insmod nfsd failed
