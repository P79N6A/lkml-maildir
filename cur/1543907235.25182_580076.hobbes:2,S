Is it possible to send raw packets via ppp under Linux?
More specifically, in 2.4 series kernels such as RH's 2.4.21-47 kernel?
I've trying to modify the DHCP 3.0.1 code provided with RH 3 so I can  
send requests via a PPP connection (standard RS-232), and it is just  
being dropped by the stack according to ifconfig and debug statements  
in ppp_generic.c.
Thanks,
Kevin
