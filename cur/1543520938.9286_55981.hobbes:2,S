It IS possible to use more. Just not so easy :-)

Ask in glibc mailing list. It's not kernel limitation but rather glibc's
malloc limitation. Perhaps you can use mmap or something like this to allocate
more then 910MiB RAM.
You need virtual memory not only for heap but also for stack, for shared
libraries and so on. Default layout allows usage of only 910MiB for heap...
