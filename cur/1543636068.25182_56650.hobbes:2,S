I am working on a A3D driver for the Linux system, currently I need help with hardware specs, to run A3D the line in needs to become a line out (only on systems with one normal line out present,anyway) , to do this, I need to know if certain  conditions present, the soundcard, needs physicaly to be able to throw out electrical current, does anyoneknow what cards do, because the card doesnt always have to be the owner of a A3D chipset.
