They don't - check_sysemu is used also in TT mode.

PPC port is not maintained at the moment - there are some rumors of somebody 
reviving it, but nothing is certain.

I saw that from someone else - I don't remember what was the problem, but it 
seemed to be some strange kind of .config. Make sure that CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO 
and CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER are both set (the second is the needed one, the 
first implies the second for UML).
"make oldconfig ARCH=um" should fix such problems.
