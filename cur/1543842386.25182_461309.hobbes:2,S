After 8 hours of stress testing on two machines, no crash and no freeze. 
So Oleg's fix seems to do the trick. Thanks Oleg :)
I'll keep the patches applied on both machines, even without stress tests 
it is still better to make sure nothing bad happens in the long run.

There's nothing really special running on this laptop. Slackware 10.2 with 
xterm, firefox, sylpheed, xchat, and that's about it. At least one of the 
crashes I had yesterday happened when I was actively using firefox, I 
can't tell for the other one.
The difference with the system where no problem was observed may be that 
the laptop has a preemptive kernel, and the desktop hasn't.
