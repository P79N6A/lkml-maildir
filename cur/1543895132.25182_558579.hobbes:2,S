No.  I'm questioning why the vendor could keep this privilege to
itself.

No, and I've already explained how I believe this can be accomplished
with the wording in the GPLv3dd4, although IANAL to tell whether
that's correct.
Just make the tivoization machinery require two keys: one that the
vendor keeps, one that the vendor gives to the user (maybe without
ever knowing it).  Neither one can install modifications alone, but
the user can approve modifications by the vendor, and the vendor can
approve modifications by the user.  This is still not ideal, but it at
least doesn't permit the vendor to remove features from under the
user.

You haven't really read that bit of dd3 or dd4, have you?
Or the various portions of this thread in which I showed your
assumptions are utterly broken?
> RMS _does not want the Tivo to use a GPLv3 kernel_,
I know you're not stupid, but I can't tell whether you're malicious or
just misinformed.
RMS does not want TiVo (or anyone else) to disrespect users' freedoms,
and installing technical measures to prevent users from adapting the
software to suit their needs and running their modifications is
disrespecting users freedoms.
That he is not opposed to the idea of TiVo using a GPLv3 kernel is
easy to see, if you take the time to read the draft instead of
spreading false assumptions about it:
  this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
  retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
  Product

Hey, wouldn't this be just tit-for-tat? ;-)
