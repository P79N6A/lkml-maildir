... that, BTW, would kill the crap like
typedef struct ...

Yup, structure "shared" by kernel and userland.  Look through the
include/linux/lvm.h - it's choke-full of that.  And quite a few
of them contain fields like
	struct proc_dir_entry *foo
	struct block_device *bar
	struct list_head baz
outside of these #ifdef __KERNEL__...

Umm...  Is the version in main tree actually maintained?
