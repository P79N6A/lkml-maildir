I've only today discovered a bug in the SunRPC that might cause this
sort of problem.
Basically, the current setup allows an rpc_task to exit while it is
still asleep on a queue. If happens to get woken up by an interrupt
while exiting, then you're liable to corrupt the rpc task queues...
Cheers,
  Trond
