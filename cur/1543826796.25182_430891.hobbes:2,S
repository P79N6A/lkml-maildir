I'm happy to leave the code as is, as it has been working
for the past 8 years. I'm just trying to fix build errors
for random (unusable) kernel configs that a few people
have complained about.
Many, many people have chimed in so far without looking
at the details and I keep responding many, many, many times
that the generic HDLC support is *optional* for the synclink drivers.
So your suggestion of 'fixing' the code will *break* it.
Either unnecessary code is forced on someone, or
they are deprived of necessary code.
But OK, I'm willing to listen: how do you suggest optionally
including generic HDLC support in the synclink drivers,
depending on whether generic HDLC is enabled without
referring to a configuration option?
