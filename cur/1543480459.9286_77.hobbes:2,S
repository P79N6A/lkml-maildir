When compiling the kernel...
mm.h		includes sched.h
sched.h		includes binfmts.h
binfmts.h	includes fs.h
#if defined __KERNEL__
		fs.h 		includes affs_fs_i.h
		affs_fs_i.h	includes time.h
		time.h		defines struct timeval
	and...
sched.h		includes timex.h	/* Starting with 2.2.0-pre1 */
timex.h		uses struct timeval	/* OK because in the kernel */
					/* time.h was included */
When compiling libc-5.4.46...
__fpathconf.c	includes sched.h
sched.h		includes binfmts.h
binfmts.h	includes fs.h
	and...
sched.h		includes timex.h	/* Starting with 2.2.0-pre1 */
timex.h		uses struct timeval	/* Not OK because in libc */
					/* time.h is not included */
Basically timex.h will not compile unless time.h has already
been included.
Should the kernel headers be idempotent?
(i.e. should I be able to write
========================= xxq.c begin
#include <linux/some-arbitrary-header.h>
========================= xxq.c end
and compile it?
