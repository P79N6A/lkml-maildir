Then you have something wrong in the shell configuration of the remote
machine. I do not see any problems in having a ssh shell opened from a
UTF-8 terminal to a machine where the shell environment is also
configured to use UTF-8 environment.
The only problem that may appear if you deliberatedly configured the
user environment on the other side for latin1, then you would have to
fix it in some way. Eg. configuring LANG depending on SSH* variables in
.bashrc.

Eduard.
