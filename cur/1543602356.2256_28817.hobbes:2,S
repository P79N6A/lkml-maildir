Hi all,
getting the following in dmesg. Don't know if it's iptables related or
not. The ethernet card in question is a Intel EtherPRO 100 with the
stock 2.4.8 driver. Everything is working great, but I'm mostly
curious why these messages appear. A search in Google or LKM 
didn't turn anything immidiately, but I might have missed something.

/proc/pci:
  Bus  0, device  19, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 2).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe4100000 [0xe4100fff].
      I/O at 0x7400 [0x741f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe4000000 [0xe40fffff].
The card in question is the "public/internet" side of the firewall.
There are two additional interfaces, eth0 (private ethernet) and eth2,
a radio LAN.
Thanks,
Jens Petersohn
