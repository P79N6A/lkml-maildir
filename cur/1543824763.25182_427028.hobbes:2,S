I know - I am on all the ALSA lists and read every bug report.  And in
fact compilation errors are quite rare.  The numbers are misleading
because "0-Compilation error" is the default category in the bug tracker
and lots of users don't set it correctly ;-)
It is unfortunate that users hitting an already-fixed bug have to
compile it themselves, but I think the solution is for the distros to
follow ALSA a bit more closely and apply the critical "no sound" fixes
to their packages rather than waiting for the next release.  I know for
a fact that Ubuntu does this.
