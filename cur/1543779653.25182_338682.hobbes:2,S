That is the wrong reason.  We use our own journaling layer for the
reason that Vivaldi used his own melody.
I don't know anything about GFS, but expecting a filesystem author to
use a journaling layer he does not want to is a bit arrogant.  Now, if
you got into details, and said jbd does X, Y and Z, and GFS does the
same X and Y, and does not do Z as well as jbd, that would be a more
serious comment.  He might want to look at how reiser4 does wandering
logs instead of using jbd..... but I would never claim that for sure
some other author should be expected to use it.....  and something like
changing one's journaling system is not something to do just before a
merge.....
