i've had the same problem even with 2.6.9. i saw your note from a couple
years ago saying you thought the via board was broken in this regard
(unconnected pin or something). and i wondered, but how come it works in
windows w/ SMP then? 
anyway, i also am ok with noapic, tho i wonder what performance losses there
are when an SMP system cant handle interrupts assigned to either proc.
hey, i'd even be willing to try some soldering or board changes if you had a
sense of what was disconnected. but are you sure its not a kernel issue?
thanks
