Thanks a lot for all your help.  I've got two last questions:  From  
the code in entry_32.s I can dig up "current" from ((struct  
paca_struct *)r13)->__current to read a personality flag from it,  
right?  Digging up offsets in assembly can't be very fun :-\   
Secondly, is there a preferred existing field into which I should  
stick said flag or just stuff it somewhere?
This part seems like the easiest so far; no icky binary format  
parsing, no confusing memory maps.  Thanks once again!

Ok, I figured it was going to be ugly; maybe not quite _that_ ugly  
but my hopes weren't high enough for you to dash to any real degree :-D.
