ewww..  You seem to be implying that when the readahead
code goes to get a new page, it's reclaiming unused
readahead pages *in preference to* already-used pages.
That would be awful, wouldn't it?
Perhaps an algorithm would be:
a) Call mark_page_accessed once against readahead pages.
b) If thrashing is detected, call mark_page_accessed
   twice against readahead pages, to move them onto the
   active list.
   The intent being to say "this page is important.  Throw
   something else away".
Seems this would delay the onset of the problem significantly?
