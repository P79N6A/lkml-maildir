Andrew,
I encountered a problem in running shpchp & pciehp drivers on
2.6.9-rc2-mm4 kernel.  With ACPI & MSI enabled in the kernel, I 
got dev->irq properly for the hot-plug controllers.  With ACPI 
enabled and MSI not-enabled in this kernel, I got dev->irq 
equal 0 for the controllers. With the same options set in 
2.6.8.1 & 2.6.9-rc2, things worked fine on the same system.
Do you know of any changes in the -mm4 that might have caused this
problem?
Thanks,
Dely
