Subject: 2.4.20 DRM/DRI issue with Radeon

In the 2.4.20 kernel changelog I see comments about having consistent
DRM modules with XFree4.2.0. I have a Radeon Mobility M6 LY in a Dell
laptop and would like to get DRI working. Whenever I use any 2.4.*
(including 2.4.20) kernel I get the following messages in
/var/log/XFree86.0.log, and DRM is not enabled. Is this supposed to be
working in 2.4.20 ? I am using a Mandrake 8.2 system (except for the
kernel).
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] loaded kernel module for "radeon" driver
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] created "radeon" driver at busid "PCI:1:0:0"
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 8192 byte SAREA at 0xd1bb1000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] mapped SAREA 0xd1bb1000 to 0x40026000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] framebuffer handle = 0xe0000000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 1 reserved context for kernel
(EE) RADEON(0): [dri] RADEONDRIScreenInit failed because of a version
mismatch.
[dri] radeon.o kernel module version is 1.1.1 but version 1.2.x is
needed.
[dri] see 
http://gatos.sf.net/
 for an updated module
[dri] Disabling DRI.
(EE) RADEON(0): [drm] failed to remove DRM signal handler
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] removed 1 reserved context for kernel
Thx
