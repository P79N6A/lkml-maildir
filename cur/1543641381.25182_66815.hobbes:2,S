Hmm. Then I've actually tested this... I can at least say it's stable,
even if I'm not wild about the approach.

I've already written the patch to address it, though of course, I can
post those traces along with the patch once it's rediffed. (It's trivial
though -- just a fresh GFP flag and a check for it before calling
out_of_memory(), setting it in mempool_alloc(), and ignoring it in
slab.c.) It requires several rounds of "un-throttling" to reproduce
the OOM's, the nature of which I've outlined elsewhere.
One such trace is below, some of the others might require repeating the
runs. It's actually a relatively deep call chain, I'd be worried about
blowing the stack at this point as well.
Cheers,
Bill

They also pile up on ->i_sem of the dir they create files in, not sure
what to do about that aside from working around it in userspace. It
basically takes this kind of stuff so the things don't all fall asleep
on some resource or other, though the box is still pretty much idle.
