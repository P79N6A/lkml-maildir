+	  The default is to support 16 partitions per aoe device. Some
+	  systems lack good support for devices with large minor
+	  numbers.
+
+	  Such systems will be able to use more aoe disks when
+	  AOE_PARTITIONS is set to one, but you won't be able to
+	  partition the disks, and you must make sure your device
+	  nodes are created to work with the value you select.
+
+	  If unsure, use 16.
