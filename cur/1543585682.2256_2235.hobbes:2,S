That is the wrong way to phrase these things.
Large processes usually do not have a definite set of needed resources.
They can use lots of memory for buffers and cache and hash and be a bit
faster, or use much less and be a bit slower.
Linux first promises a lot of memory, but then fails to deliver,
without returning any error to the program.
