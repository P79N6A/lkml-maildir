the motivation of that fix wasnt UML - that was just an (indeed 
incorrect) after-thought when i wrote up the commit log. The fix is 
obviously right - although it doesnt fix UML.
btw., did you see my stream of fixes about UML?

it is wrong that it "doesnt fix anything". Look at the change itself:
- * Force always-inline if the user requests it so via the .config:

 #if !defined(CONFIG_ARCH_SUPPORTS_OPTIMIZED_INLINING) || \
-    !defined(CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING) && (__GNUC__ >= 4)
+    !defined(CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING) || (__GNUC__ < 4)
before the change it was only possible to disable the optimization on 
gcc 4 and above. The intended (and now implemented) condition is to only 
change anything on gcc 4 and above. I.e. on gcc3x the config option has 
no effect at all - and that's what we want.
