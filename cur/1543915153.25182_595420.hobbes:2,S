Much better.   You may also consider a possibility of
letting your local MTA do the  Message-ID generation, unless
you are tracking something with it and thus need to know the
generated values.  .. but apparently git much prefers sending
email by SMTP, where the message-id must be present, or one
really should block any such emails..  (except that systems
like qmail send error messages without message-id ...)
My own recipe is:
       sprintf("%d-%d-%d", time , getpid, ++localsequence)
catenate on that your favourite domain name where that recipe
is likely to be valid, and you are all set.
