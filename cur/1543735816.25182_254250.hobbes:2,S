If by "surprise removal" you mean an Itanium CPU or Memory no longer are 
accessable by the rest of the hardware, the result will be fatal MCA.  For 
example,  if an Itanum CPU tried to load from Memory that no longer exists, 
the load will time out and the CPU will generate a fatal MCA.  It may (or may
not) be possible to enhance the MCA/linux error handling code to handle this 
situation, but the current code does not.
