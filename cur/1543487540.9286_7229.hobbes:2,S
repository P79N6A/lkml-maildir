Try again:
#define SIGTSTP         20
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int signum = atoi(argv[1]);
  struct sigaction sa;
  sa.sa_handler  = SIG_DFL;
  sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
  sa.sa_flags    = 0;
  sa.sa_restorer = 0;
  sigaction(signum, &sa, NULL);
  printf("Ready, pid = %ld!\n", (long)getpid());
  while(1);
  printf("We shouldn't get here...\n");
  exit(1);
}
: cesium 13 ; gcc -o sigcheck sigcheck.c
: cesium 14 ; ./sigcheck 20
Ready, pid = 28164!
[[ In another xterm ]]
kill -20 28164
[[ On the original xterm ]]

If what you claimed was true, almost nothing would work.  The odds are
overwhelming that your test is just plain bogus.
