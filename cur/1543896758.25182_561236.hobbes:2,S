DLM needs to depend on SYSFS for another reason: it directly
"select"s CONFIGFS_FS when configfs itself "depends on SYSFS".
I suspect it selects configfs directly to make it easier to pick DLM,
by not forcing users to first go and pick configfs just to make DLM
visible in menuconfig, but such usage of select is generally "evil".
There was a thread started by Al Viro some time back which
started discussions on possible kbuild-solutions to this "select
of a symbol that itself depends on another" problem, but I'm not
sure what happened of that ...
