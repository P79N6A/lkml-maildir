I _really_ think that we should do this in pci_msi_enable().
Screw cards that are not PCI-2.3 compliant - just make the rule be that if 
you use MSI, you _have_ to allow us to set the disable-INTx bit. It's then 
up to the drivers to decide if they can use MSI or not.
(Even a number of cards that are not PCI-2.3 may simply not _implement_ 
the disable-INTx bit, and in that case, they can use MSI if they disable 
INTx automatically - the ).
