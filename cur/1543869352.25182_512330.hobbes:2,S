I have done lots of loops like that and understood it immediately.
Nice, short, _clear_ and no - a loop that counts down instead of
up is not difficult at all. 
Testing "i--" instead of "i >= 0" is also something I consider trivial,
even though I don't code that much.  If this is among the worst you
see, then the kernel source must be in great shape ;-)
