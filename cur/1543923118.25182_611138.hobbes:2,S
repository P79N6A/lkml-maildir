Subject: [PATCH - SH] Clean up maple bus code to supress compiler warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/28/55

The API for uevent has changed for 2.6.24 and this patch makes a
consequential clean up.
(Apols to linux-sh list users seeing this for the second time, I
should have included lkml first time round for completeness)
