I just checked and you're right, the number of compilers that actually
run is j-1, for all j>1.  I assume this is a problem with the parallel
build process, but it does not invalidate these results for comparing
the scheduler performance with different patches.

The 1-3% performance loss when HT is enabled for -j1 is still very real.
