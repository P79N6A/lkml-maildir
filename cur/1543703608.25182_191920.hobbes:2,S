Well a quick profile of `dbench 4' on a localhost mount on a P4-HT:

Turning on spinlock inlining:

That's quite a lot of contention on the lock_kernel() in remote_llseek().
The context switch rate is 45000/sec, so schedule() gets a workout.
I do recall seeing quite a lot of BKL contention within NFS itself running
across 100bT on 4-way.  That was several months ago - maybe things
improved?
