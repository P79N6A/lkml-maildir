Well I see the comment. Writing to IO Space where there are no devices
is basically a no-op. The ISA/PC/AT bus is asynchronous, it is not
clocked. If there's is no contention due to bus activity from some
hardware read, it's just some address lines and data bits that are
eventually sinked by the bus capacity. The CPU isn't forced to wait
for anything. Since it's in I/O space, you don't even get the delay
from a cache-line reload. No thanks, it's bogus as a delay mechanism.
Cheers,
