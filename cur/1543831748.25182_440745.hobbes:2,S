The 2nd one is probably more urgent than the first. I can see a general 
benefit from timestamp in ms, beyond that seems to be a specialty 
requirement best provided at the application level rather than the bits 
of a trillion inodes which need no such thing.
One argument against it is that with SMP with *almost* the same time in 
each CPU, cache everywhere in the i/o process, and various flavors of 
network filesystems, the atime/mtime become less and less useful for 
determining with great precision which file is most recently modified or 
accessed.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
