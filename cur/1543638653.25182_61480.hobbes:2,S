It was my fault: I explained it incorrectly. sfence is only used if both
CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE and CONFIG_MMXEXT are set, which currently never
happens with the existing processors.

That's why sfence is not used unless CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE (and
CONFIG_X86_MMXEXT) is defined.
mfence and lfence instead replace the "lock; addl $0,0(%%esp)". Is this
wrong?
