Great catch.
I think it may be a n_tty line discipline bug, brought on by the fact that
the PTY buffering is now 4kB rather than 2kB. 4kB is also the
N_TTY_BUF_SIZE, and if n_tty has some off-by-one error, that would explain 
it.
Does the problem go away if you change the default value of "chunk" (in 
drivers/char/tty_io.c:do_tty_write) from 4096 to 2048? If so, that means 
that the pty code has _claimed_ to have written 4kB, and only ever wrote 
4kB-1 bytes. That in turn implies that "ldisc.receive_room()" disagrees 
with "ldisc.receive_buf()".
