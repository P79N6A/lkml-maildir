It may not matter much because few people care about forced media these
days. And it is debatable whether trying to guess the users intention
is a good idea (we lack means for users to manipulate autoneg results
via advertisted values but that's no big deal).
However, "silently ignoring" strikes me as a very poor choice, in
stark contrast to Unix/Linux tradition. A user issues a command which
cannot be executed and gets the same response that is used to indicate
success!? What school of user interface design is that? How is that
not confusing users? </rant>
