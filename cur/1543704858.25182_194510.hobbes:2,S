We do, and the people who care about readX_check() had better be careful.
Quite possibly the "clear_pcix_error()" has to get a lock and disable
interrupts, and the "read_pcix_error()" routine would release the lock.
But that depends on the hardware - details like whether hardware can track
individual errors on multiple CPU's or not.
And keep in mind, 99% of all people won't ever care.
