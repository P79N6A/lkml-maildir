Francois Romieu got me to run 'lspci -x', and came to the conclusion that the 
net card and scsi card are sharing IRQs...
  Someone just told me tha the had had a sound card and a network card sharing 
IRQs, and that caused the network card to generate 'oodles of interrupts for 
no apparent reason'.
  This on the right track?
Thanks
Chris

Each of your ethernet adapter shares an irq with a scsi controller.
I had some results pulling some cards from the PCI slots and moving
the network adapter around until its irq differs but I won't claim
it's the cure for your problem (it was on HP Netserver motherboards).
