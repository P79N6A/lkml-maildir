hi...
Machine: DEC Alpha XL300 (Alcor/XLT)
         boots from scsi, and ide is used modular
IDE-Controller: Promise ATA100 controller (PCI card)
                bios knows absolutely nothing about IDE
                (there aren't even options to set drive geometry etc)
Deadlocks on loading the ide-modules with
        modprobe ide-probe-mod  || return=$rc_failed
        modprobe ide-disk || return=$rc_failed
(Nothing in the logs, no visible output on the screen)
Applying Andre Hedrick's ide.2.4.1-p8.all.01172001.patch.gz fixes it -
with this patch ide works like a charm - thanks for your good work Andre!
more info's available on request
