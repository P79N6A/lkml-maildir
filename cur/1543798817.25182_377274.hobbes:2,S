Agreed about the assembler, but one way or the other, x86_64 is the only
arch we support.

Fine.

Makes many nanoseconds of difference to us for our latency numbers.  At
the low latency numbers we measuring (1.29us), this is a very important
difference to our customers.
> You don't want to always compile your driver with -g3.
Good point.  I'll ask around here why we're doing this.

I'll see what I can do.
