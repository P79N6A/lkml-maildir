Thatd be unfortunate - there are very few iclog buffers relative to
every other metadata buffer, so growing the struct for all of those
too would not be ideal (I remember Steve going on pagebuf shrinking
exercises in the distant past, to fit more of em in memory at once,
I can't remember what benchmark in particular he was using though).
