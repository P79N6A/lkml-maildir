I've downloaded that patch, and compiled my kernel with modules
disabled:
* your patch:
"size vmlinux.ta"	
	text	1743839
	data	 277738
	total	2440873
* your patch, but
#define request_module(format, args...)		({-EINVAL;})
"size vmlinux.ms"
	text	1743167
	data	 277738
	total	2440201
--> an empty inline function saves around 670 byte decompressed image
size.
Imho CONFIG_KMOD changes will be extremely rare, I'd prefer an inline
function. [or the gcc'ism ({-EINVAL;}), or any other trick].
Btw,
* fs/nls/nls_base.c doesn't compile, AFAICS the 'if' statement in line
211 is now superflous.
* you could use the gcc'im " __attribute__ ((format(printf, 1, 2))))",
this would cause an error message if someone tries to load his new
'h%ell%o' module. printk already uses this this gcc'ism.
* several callers of request_module() do not include errno.h, ie I got
error messages during compilation with my patch :-(
