I implemented the BusyBox mount command last year.  (Well, rewrote three times 
until just about none of the old code was left.)  Getting remount to work 
right is a monster headache.  (The new flags _replace_ the old flags, not 
delta against them, so you have to parse /etc/mtab (or /proc/mounts), read 
the old flags out of that, mask them yourself, and supply them back in.  And 
of course, not all of them are flags, some remain strings, but you can't keep 
strings you turned into flags because the driver will barf that it's an 
unrecognized string option...  Headache.  And don't get me started on vfat 
spitting back string options from /proc/mounts that are THE DEFAULT VALUES...  
Grrr.  I'll stop now.)
You can always umount/mount yourself.

I had to add MS_SILENT (1<<15) to the default mount options for busybox 
(because otherwise the kernel got log message diarrhea).  I was seriously 
tempted to add MS_NOATIME to that, but didn't.
I should write up a good "mount" spec, from the kernel's point of view.  
(There isn't one.  I looked.)
