   Thanks! On 2.6 it works as expected. Test with two concurrent memory 
allocations took some time, but both apps stops exactly when memory was 
depleted. Great.
   Did rmap has something todo with this?
   As I see from implementation of do_mmap_pgoff() - it changed from 2.4 
to 2.6 - but there are a lot of common things.
   If I will do dumb back port of this check to 2.4 - do you think it 
will work? 2.4->2.6 memory accounting changed?
   I didn't found this check in your rmap patches for 2.4.22. (btw 
thanks for keeping them up-to-date).

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
