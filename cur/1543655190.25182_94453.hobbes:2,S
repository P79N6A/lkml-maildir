The second Oops is the *best* one IMO. I got it just over 7 days. (like
7 days 6 hours or something. I've still been testing the crud out of
this kernel on like hardware, and can't reproduce it. I'd love to know a
method for reproducing this for my beta environment.

Since we run ~1TB dbs on the systems, and a LOT of IO, and Qlogic
drivers, I think that's the culprit. Will swapper use less stack in more
recent kernels?(XFS will be updated as part of a plan for the new year
I'm putting together. Till then, it's reboot every 7 days)

I hope not. :)
