1% ... I didn't expect Linux to take THIS much of a hit due to
not using the zones on some architectures ...
I guess this is enough of a difference to make sure we don't do
these extra iterations when they're not needed.

I guess it may be better to just have include/asm-<foo>/mmzone.h
files for each architecture. Maybe even optionally behind an
IFNDEF so we could start with almost empty files for each
architecture and only fill in something when the values really
need to be different ...
