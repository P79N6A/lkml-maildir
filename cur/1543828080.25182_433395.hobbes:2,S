Sounds like you should take a look at the v4l loopback device
(
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/VideoFourLinuxLoopbackDevice
).
Otherwise it may be better to ask the question on the v4l mailing list
(
https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list
).
Anyway, since you already capture the video, why do you have to pipe
it through a v4l device?
