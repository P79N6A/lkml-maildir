Hi Manu,
now if this is your evalution about it all, then let me tell you that I feel deeply sorry about it.
Fact is:
Noone ever intended to send in patches limiting the capability of the said device (DST): I never did, Trent never did, Markus, Mauro, Andrew and others never did...
Instead of this we all have very different knowledge and understanding levels, with you obviously being the one with the most elaborate and sophisticated level.
So please why, instead of marking other people as "rude" whose solutions you do not appreciate at all, don't you just pick up the pratical proposals of other persons, even if you do not like them for some reasons, and at least try to raise them up to a far more better level?
Thus you definitely could avoid a lots of flaming, misunderstanding, and other counterproductive things to happen...
And this would conform to practising the synergetic principle, wouldn't it?
Just one hint to help you: I remember a mail from Johannes in which he told me that you started up this whole development thing from a zero level some two or three years  ago. And Johannes not forgot to state that in the beginning you were nothing but nerving... (now add a smiley behind this, please, I'd deeply appreciate you to do).
Above that:
1. Taking part in testing the mm-tree and eliminating horrible bugs in it I never experienced but positive and warm compromise solutions in the end. Experiencing this is highly enlarging one's own personality.
2. If you start up at zero (like you did once too - see above and ask Johannes if you do not remember at all) it is no good start at all if your humble effort is being thrown off after the first or second reject. That's highly discouraging, and if it happens very often the bad experience remains in one's own subjective perception filter.
3. When I wrote patches since then I never gave up until there weren't any
a. fuzz factors
b. rejections
anymore. Instead I highly tried to put Andrew's "The perfect patch"-guidelines into practice. Although this kind of perfection reduces maintainers to gatekeepers in some cases - the borders of what is what and who is who are highly mutual...
So the basic thing is just:
1. To understand that everyone develops, independent from the knowledge and understanding level.
2. To understand that everyone has good ideas at least sometimes, independent from knowledge and understanding level.
And, even if you do not want to understand it out of whatever reason, it is no fun for any person to sound or act "abusive".
We're all just trying to search and find solutions, that's all.
Above that I want to thank you for the theoretical introduction that you gave.
And I hope it helps after all.
But I am still very sad that the cx878 project died the way it died, so very close before its maturity to be implied into Mercurial tree. I did my best to help, but in the end I nothing but wasted time - and after all, I do not remember where the repository resides, after thaddatil.net has been down for months now... What a pity!
Cheers
