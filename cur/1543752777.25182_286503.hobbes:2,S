Something seems to have broken with 2.6.11-rc1-mm1, which worked ok with 
2.6.10-mm3.
NET: Registered protocol family 17

VFS: Cannot open root device "md2" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
The system is running 5 RAID-1 partitions, and md2 is the root as per 
grub.conf.  Problem seems to be that raid autodetection finds no raid 
partitions :(
The two ST380013AS SATA drives are detected earlier in the boot, so I don't 
think that's the problem..
