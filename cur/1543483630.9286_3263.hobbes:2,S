Well, I have seen 80x50 (but no more) on 3 different cards that were not
explicitely labeled hercules (At least I think most of the monochrome cards
were hercules-compatible, as were these). Implementing 80x50 would be a neat
feature.
But what I wanted to know is whether the clipping that occurs is correct (or
should not a message consisting of 100 characters be word-wrapped to 80
chars on the first line and 20 on the second, i mean behave differently from
the output on vga-cards that are doing 132x60 ?)
All the syslog that is displayed on the monochrome device is 35 lines
'older':
80x25 (small window)

     132
There must be a way to get everything displayed on the small window (and not
virtually or clipped )!
Thanks,
Soeren.
