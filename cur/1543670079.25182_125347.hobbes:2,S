The VT system totally depends on the input api now. Previously you could 
build the VT system without selecting CONFIG_INPUT at all. Of course this 
caused build issues. As for selecting the input layer as a module you had 
the issue of booting but not having a usable keyboard. Makes it a 
challenge to type insmod input.o. Someday I plan to make the VT system 
modular (useful for embedded systems).

For embedded systems you don't really need the VT console. The type build 
will be serial console, input api and fbdev. No need for a VT console. 
On these devices you have serious constrants. So having the inout layer 
modular is a plus.
