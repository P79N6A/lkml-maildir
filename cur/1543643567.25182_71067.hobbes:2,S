all the new 'thread group' semantics (group exit, group-broadcast and
group-balanced signals, group exec(), soon-to-come group coredump) are
connected to the CLONE_THREAD property which is a relatively new clone
bit. All the other thread properties (such as CLONE_VM, CLONE_SIGHAND) are
not affected by all the recent threading related changes. [well, they got
significantly faster, but no behavioral change.]
