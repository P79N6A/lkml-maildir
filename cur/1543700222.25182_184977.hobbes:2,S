But you're forgetting what the MAINTAINERS file is for. I can't but help
thinking that this is linked with the email you sent earlier, but that's
just me. Frankly i reckon this particular case could be settled by
removing both from MAINTAINERS as neither has code in the 2.6 linux
kernel. Anybody looking for realtime Linux kernel capabilities can just do
a Google.
