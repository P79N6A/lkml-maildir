Yes. I accidentally linked them, see below.

Yes. But there's some flexibility.

Yes.

My apologies for linking the idea of references to fewer pointers.
They're not linked, except in how I discovered them.
I once had a project (that used threads, so it was "kernel-like",
in that race conditions had to be dealt with).  One day, for the 
the hell of it, I decided to create a struct and keep it on the 
stack, instead of mallocing it.  Since this struct was accessed 
only by a few small, well-defined routines that did not keep any 
pointers to it, this worked just fine. And skipping the malloc/free
felt good, so I liked it.
Then I thought that maybe I could push the idea, see how far I 
could go. Well, of course, the code was filled with various 
objects, all of which *seemed* to be (or seemed to need to be) 
long-lifetime objects. And they all stored pointers to one-another,
since they all needed to get access to one-another at various points,
for various reasons. 
Well, I really wanted to alloc objects on stack, and so that forced
me to think about how to get rid of pointers (since a pointer to 
an object on stack is deadly). And that forced me to think about
lifetime. And some of this thinking was quite hard.  But encouraged
by some modest success at first, I found that I was able to 
eliminate almost all the pointers, and almost all the mallocs 
(maybe several dozen of each, scattered accross maybe several dozen
structs). And I was flabbergasted, since the resulting program
actually got smaller in the process, and faster. And the 
null-pointer derefs vanished. 
Now, maybe this was specific to the project, and can't be replicated
elsewhere.  But this was a communcations daemon: it basically 
was a pool of threads, each thread handling a long-lived,
stateful "session" of requests and responses from some remote server,
and so while its not the kernel, that's a reasonably complex thing. 
I'm not crazy enough to suggest that one could do the same thing 
in the Linux kernel, since one probably can't, but now that we're 
here and all, it does make me wonder.  FWIW, the two designs of
the commo daemon were radically different; things that were sliced 
one way got reworked to flow and be handled in a completely 
different order.  You can't just get rid of pointers with some 
trivial restructuring; you have to figure out how not to need them.
