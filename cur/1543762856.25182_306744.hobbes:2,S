Subject: Override 802.11 MAC functions in Linux Kernel

Hi,
I am trying to implement the EDCF described in new standard 802.11e (This
standard -well, actually it's a draft- tries to define QoS for 802.11
networks).
I would like to implement it with a module over the 2.6.11.5 kernel.
My idea is to override the regular 802.11 MAC operation and redirect it to
the module so that I can treat it like 802.11e MAC specifies.
I have browsed a lot of pages, but none of them explains how to override the
functions. Do you know how can I redirect all the functions to the modules?
Is it possible to do it with a module? Or maybe should I work directly over
the kernel code?
If I had to work over the kernel code, which are the files directly involved
with the 802.11 MAC?
Thank you very much!
