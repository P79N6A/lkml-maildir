Yeah, I have a link to the asus page where my case is handled, if you
want. ;-)

I tested with 2.6.16-rc6. The only patch (aside of this one) I applied was
the libata patch as I need support for the PATA port on a Promise
controller. 
It doesn't work and nothing appears in the log (not even the text that it is
still "hiding"). I'm starting to think that I missed some step. Is there
something else needed aside of applying the patch as it is, recompile the
kernel and install it?
I touch the kernel code only seldom, usually I port a patch from one version
to another, like the promise PATA patch to the SuSE kernel, but I don't
really know the kernel internals.
