Stephen,
not being familiar with either maintaining my own git tree or the -next
process, I'd still like to get logfs into mainline.  It has gone through
six rounds of reviews and the last has been mostly about crossing some
i's here and dotting some t's there.
So should it simmer in -next and -mm for another month?  Should it go
straight into -linus?
Either way, please pull from
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/joern/logfs.git/
Jörn
