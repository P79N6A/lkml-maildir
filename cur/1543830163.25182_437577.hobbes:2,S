I believe that pmu68k started out as a copy of pmu. The versions of PMU
on the 68k PowerBooks are just older than the ones on ppc. They are
fundamentally the same, it's just that the ppc systems have various fixes
and new features. Ideally the files would be merged back together and
split in a more logical fashion to share the code that is the same. Each
one already supports multiple versions of the chip.

Several other parts of the kernel submit pmu requests, but most of them
use pmu_request(). It's probably better to unify this API set. The cuda
and IIsi drivers have equivalent calls, for that matter. I wanted to
make a generic call that would switch to the active one of those, but
the idea didn't go over too well. It was probably due to the bad taste
everyone had from when adb_request() was used for that purpose.
