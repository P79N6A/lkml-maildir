Now you have me puzzled...
All I can work out is that I was able to successfully boot a 2.2.12
kernel of about 1.3M in size using the version of LILO supplied as
standard with RedHat 6.0 (but for some reason, I was not able to boot
a similar sized 2.3.17 kernel using that method). You appear to be
claiming that LILO is not able to boot suchlike kernels?
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
