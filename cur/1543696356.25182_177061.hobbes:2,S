Daniel Quinlan originally maintained this, now it is orphaned.  His endian
patch, which implemented the correct behavior according to the docs (which
basically listed always do little endian as a todo), was dropped.
We have been maintaining this patch on our kernel, but it really should go
in - I don't want to spend a ton of time like I did last time to have it
dropped again, however - is anyone thinking of maintaining cramfs?  What
are the chances of the endian fix going in if I submit it again?  (if even
the former maintainer had no success).  I would maintain cramfs if desired
- it hasn't really changed in a long time except in regards to higher
level fs changes.
Thanks,
Brad
