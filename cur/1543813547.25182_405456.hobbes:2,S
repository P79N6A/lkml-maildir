Hi,
I see the same, but use 2.6.16-rc4 and didn't report before, 
because I switched from Debian/Sarge to Kubuntu/Dapper
which changed just to much for proper report.
I disabled vm86-support and run on a Dual PIII with an ATI-Rage XL
using the same driver.
Did you disable vm86 support, too?
# CONFIG_VM86 is not set
Regards
Ingo Oeser
