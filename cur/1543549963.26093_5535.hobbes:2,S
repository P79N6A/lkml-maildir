For what it's worth, the SA1100 serial driver has been registered with
me on the Low-Density Serial Ports major (204) as /dev/ttySA0-2 (minor
5-7).
Russ is 100% correct that different drivers shouldn't use the
same device numbers, unless they are:
a) mutually exclusive,
b) interface compatible, *AND*
c) handle all arbitration necessary.
If (a), (b) and (c) are all satisfied, it is often justified to share
device numbers and device nodes.
