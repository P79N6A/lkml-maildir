Other reasons would be:
- to view some privilaged data, such as system regs while you are
  debugging in user-space
- to view many arbitrary process address-space that use a common set
  of modules - user or kernel space

Yes, insertion of the breakpoint happens at the physical
page level and it gets written back to the disc.

The current prototype does not insert probes on COW pages, but yes eventually
we will provide probes insertions on COW'd pages feature too.
