I have had a few random hangs with my machine since I added a maxtor 27
gig IDE drive to it.  I kept trying different combinations of bus
positions etc.  I figured it was flacky hardware or something.  I added
the drive in the early 2.4 series.  Recently I became slightly suspicious
of my Adaptec 2940U2W after reading all of the problems it had in the
early 2.4.  So I upgraded the bios and got kernel 2.4.17.  Though the
problem seems diminished it is certainly not gone...
Now for the kicker...  I found a 99% guarenteed way to hard lock my
box.  I tried ripping two cds at a time.  One on the ide bus and one on
the scsi.  Just a note the data is being stored to the maxtor 27 gig
mentioned above.  The reason I point to the IDE + SCSI combo is that I can
do two scsi cdroms ripping to the maxtor and it works much more
reliably.  I am under the impression that IDE CDROMs use the ide bus quite
heavily under ripping...
General notes:
Motherboard: Supermicro P6DBU w/onboard 2940U2W
CPU: Dual PII 350mhz
SCSI Bus: 0: IBM 9gig U2W, 1: IBM 4gig U2W, 2: Pioneer DVDROM (used for
	ripping)
IDE BUS 0: Maxtor 27 gig
IDE BUS 1: Teac IDE CDRom
Also happens with Teac Slaved to Maxtor
