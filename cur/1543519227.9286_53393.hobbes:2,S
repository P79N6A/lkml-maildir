Bonding doesn't care about the protocol.  Depending on the switch and
network configuration, bonding/etherchannel only cares about mac
hardware address.
What bonding will do, is to round-robin send packets down the bonded
interfaces.  It's up to the switch/system on the other end to determine
what to do with those packets.
