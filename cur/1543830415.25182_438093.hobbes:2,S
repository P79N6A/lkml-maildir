Hello!
I have problems with autorepeat in ati_remote (drivers/usb/input) driver 
in "recent" kernels: all keys start repeating immediately without some 
delay.
This makes some things, like changing the channel prev/next or toggling 
fullscreen, etc... impossible/hard.
The problem seems to be related to FILTER_TIME and HZ=250 (which I 
forgot to change).
FILTER_TIME is defined to HZ / 20, and since 250 is not divisible by 20, 
the time will be too short to ignore enough events.
Defining FILTER_TIME to HZ / 20 + 1 seems to fix things, but I'm not 
sure if there are any bad side effects.
