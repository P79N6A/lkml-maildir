Well ...
Currently we have two implementations of cpumasks.  One (in the main
kernel presently) provides a flexible mechanism for arch-specific
optimizations and the use of alternative data types to represent
cpumasks.
The other (using the patch set I just submitted to Andrew) is one size
fits all generic only (except for arch specific bitmap implementations).
The generic only is quite a bit simpler - it has some 26 fewer kernel
source files, and it saves sparc64 some 1144 bytes of kernel text space,
as measured by Andrew.
I really don't want to go 'back' to the fancy version.  If a particular
architecture has specific additional needs, I'm certainly open to
hearing the justifications, tradeoffs and suggestions for ways to meet
those needs.
