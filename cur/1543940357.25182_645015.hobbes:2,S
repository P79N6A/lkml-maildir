well, the major difference is hea is not PCI.
All PCI cards we checked have a 1:1 relationship between PCI function (PCI
config space)
and a single ethernet port.
Even if the same Ethernet chip has two ports, it shows up as two separate
adapters from the PCI perspective (two PCI entries in /sys/bus/pci/devices

These pci functions corresponds to a
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1/port0
and
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1/port1
The busdriver currently does not find out, how many ports are in a
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1.
This is up to the hardware specific driver responsible for ehea or ehca.
Think of a PCI card where the PCI busdriver
can not determine how many ports are implemented on the card.
How should this be mapped to /sys ?
Should we try to "flatten" the ports to something like
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1_port0
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1_port1
...which means physical hierarchy information would look a bit strange,
but could be the simpler one.
The way which corresponds to the hardware would be to
improve the kernel in such a way that hierarchical ports also wortk for
netdev_register.
Then we could keep this structure
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1/port0
/sys/bus/ibmebus/devices/789D.001.XXXXXX-P1/port1
So, which way should we try?
