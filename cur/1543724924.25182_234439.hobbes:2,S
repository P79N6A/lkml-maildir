Howdy,
(I sent a similar version of this message to Jaroslav Kysela
<perex@suse.cz> but haven't heard back from him.)
I'm working with a Sony Vaio PCG-FXA32.  The "Sony Programmable I/O
Controller Driver v1.22"  (drivers/char/sonypi.c). finds a controller and
grabs ports 0x1080-0x109f.  The sound module (sound/pci/via82xx.c) finds a
VIA686A and grabs ports 0x1000-0x10ff.  The ranges overlap. I can't load
both modules.
I modified the sound driver to grab only 128 ports instead of 256 and the
driver works fine on this hardware.  In 2.6.7, it's line 2049 or so of
sound/pci/via82xx.c:
old:	if ((chip->res_port = request_region(chip->port, 256, card->driver)) == NULL) {
new:	if ((chip->res_port = request_region(chip->port, 256, card->driver)) == NULL) {
Does anyone know specifically that some chipsets need so many ports?  If
so, what info for this hardware can I supply to fix the sound driver
permanently?
Regards,
- Greg
