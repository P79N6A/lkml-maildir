Hi all, [please to CC me]
There's two things I want to comment on regarding menuconfig:
1) I know of the purpose of oldconfig, but I prefer using menuconfig for 
upgrading to newer kernel versions, because most of the time, I would select 
the standard options for new features anyway. menuconfig has the "(NEW)" 
string at the end of a feature's description. However, I find that hard to 
see among all the names of various lenghts. My proposal would be to have 
an "N" or a "NEW" appear to the _left_ of the selection boxes, so that, 
browsing through the menus, one could more easily spot the interesting 
places.
2) When selecting "Ralink driver support" (CONFIG_RT2X00), the accompanying 
drivers (CONFIG_RT2400PCI, CONFIG_RT61PC, ...) appear unindented. They should 
be indented by four spaces.
Cheers!
