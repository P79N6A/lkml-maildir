 A nice idea.  One note though -- the code depends on the TSC to be
present.  It would be better to use:
if (cpu_has_tsc)
	rdtscll(random_number);
and either preset random_number to a fixed value or even leave it
uninitialized to have it somewhat randomly set by what was found at the
stack for the TSC-less case.
