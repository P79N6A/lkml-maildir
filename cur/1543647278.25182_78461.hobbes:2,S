The simplest solution is to skip the code that enables the per-cpu 
caches if debugging is enabled:
Search for enable_all_cpucaches in mm/slab.c, and skip the call if DEBUG 
is enabled.
2.5.41-mm1 contains a partially rewritten slab, which performs the 
poisoning before adding an object into the cpu caches. Additionally, 
even caches with constructors are not poisoned - ctor and dtor calls are 
performed in kmem_cache_alloc/free.
