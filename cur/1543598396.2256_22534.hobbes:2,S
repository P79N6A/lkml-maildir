	Yes, you still can.  module_{init,exit} are defined in
the monolithic case to add the initialization routine to a list
of initializers that the kernel calls in do_initcalls
(in linux/init/main.c), and to compile the module_exit call
into nothing.  This way, you can have a driver that is written
like a module but actually supports both the modular and monolithic
cases without need for #ifdef's and different code for the two cases.
That is the primary point of the module_{init,exit} scheme.
