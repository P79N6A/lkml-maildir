 The *original* VGA, i.e. the PS/2 one, did have an IRQ, IIRC (according
to docs -- I haven't ever seen one).  Cheap clones might have lacked it,
though.
 Then there is workstation (non-PC)  hardware from early '90s which we run
on and which uses an IRQ-driven interface to graphics adapters -- not only
for vsync.
