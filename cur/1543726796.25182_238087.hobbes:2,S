I would really appreciate any testing results on this, both good
and bad.  I want to get this thing tuned and into a generally good
shape for use by everybody upstream.
I'm especially interested in how this affects compute servers,
desktops and heavily overloaded network servers (the "spamassassin
slowed my system to a crawl" symptom would be one to test ;)).
I suspect the patch may need some tweaking to help interactivity
in some cases, but maybe it'll already work magically by itself...
