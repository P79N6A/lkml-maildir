A good start might be to compare the PCI configuration registers before 
and after suspend. However, I suspect it's more complicated than that. 
Are you using the closed ATI drivers? If so, it's possible that they do 
something at X startup that they're not doing on resume. A good 
comparison might be to see if the power consumption is dramatically 
different over suspend/resume if you only boot to text mode - that is, 
never start X at all.
