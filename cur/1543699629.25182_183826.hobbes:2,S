Does it work?
I have 2 keyboard/mouse/video setup as well, but I followed 
    
http://cambuca.ldhs.cetuc.puc-rio.br/multiuser/
by Miguel Freitas with 2.4.23 kernel, because you have to unload
'keybdev' USB module.  Kernel-2.6.0 doesn't seem to give me that choice.
In my XF86Config, I had to use
    Section "InputDevice" 
	Identifier	"USB Keyboard"
	Driver	"keyboard"
	Option	"Protocol"	"usbev"
	Option	"Device"	"/dev/input/event2"
	Option	"XkbRules"	"xfree86"
	Option	"XkbModel"	"pc104"
	Option	"XkbLayout"	"us"
    EndSection
for the USB keyboard.  Note the /dev/input/event2 and "Xkb*" lines --
they were necessary.
Both are mentioned in XFree-Local-multi-user-HOWTO.  Even though the
HOWTO is more for Backstreet Ruby, I couldn't make head or tail of it.
