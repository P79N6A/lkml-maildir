Everything works OK in my system... my only gripe is that I run out of memory 
quickly. I have a Fujitsu C-7651 Lifebook laptop, Pentium III, 512 Mb Ram, 
300 Mb swap.
When I start up (with KDE) I've alredy used 300 megs of ram. The if I open 
mozilla, and view some phostos with kuickshow, thats it, I use 700 Megs of 
physical and virtual memory...
Looking at ps aux shows that 5% goes to each of the 5 mozilla processes, 3% 
for this, 2% for that... It is all accounted for in different ways. It is 
just that running under 2.4.21, with the same programs I very rarely use my 
swap memory, let alone use all my physical and swap memory.
PS
I had the same issue with test1.
PPS
Could it be that I am doing something stupid when I configure the kernel... 
This is what I have in my config file.. may be config_nohighmem?:
