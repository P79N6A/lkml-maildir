Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately that isn't an option for me (unless
2.6.12.6 supports it, which I don't think it does); the 2.6.1[34] series
are badly broken on this box; disk response is x100 slower.  The problem
seems to be in the acpi subsystem, but I'm not sure.  It's been reported
on this list, on the linux-ide list and most recently at
bugzilla.kernel.org [Bug 5594]; so far nobody has come up with a
workable fix or diagnosis (there was a suggestion about the default IRQ
used for ide, but I couldn't find where that was set in the kernel [I've
never hacked the kernel]).
