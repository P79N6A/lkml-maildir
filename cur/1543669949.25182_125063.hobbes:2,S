Very cool.  This will probably be quite useful for many users.
BTW, Niels should perhaps mention that only the new,
level-triggered version of sys_epoll is supported.

That may not be *quite* true.  Davide and I feel the edge-triggered
version of sys_epoll can be slightly faster than the level-triggered version.
Niels disagrees, but presumably a benchmark could be arranged to
settle the question.  Of course, after Davide and I win the
argument :-), Niels will say "but the level-triggered version is easier to use",
and he'll be mostly right.
I'm stuck in /dev/epoll-land for a while, but one of these days,
maybe I'll do that benchmark.
