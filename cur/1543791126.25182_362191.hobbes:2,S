The thing is that we are holding queue_lock before calling add_req_fn 
callback and also after it finishes giving it an appearance of 
atomicity.  I think q->request_fn semantics is peculiar and a bit prone 
to bug, so it might be better to make ioscheds always use generic queue 
kicking function which always uses work queue to run q->request_fn so 
that we don't have queue_lock releasing and regrabbing inbetween.  Do 
you think there can be any noticieable performance issues?
Hmmmm... One more thing about q->request_fn's locking behavior is that, 
as I noted while posting the ordered patchset, for SCSI, the behavior 
can reorder issued requests making it impossible to use ordered tags for 
flushing.  I'm thinking of submitting a patch to make scsi request_fn 
atomic w.r.t. queue_lock, but there might be some performance issues I'm 
not aware of.  Functions which release and regrab locks underneath the 
caller are just... hard.  :-p
Thanks.
