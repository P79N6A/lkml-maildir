Andrew - please remove these two patches from *-mm for now.  I need to
think more about the mmap_sem locking issues.  The questions you asked
were good ones - thanks.  My answers so far suck.
	[PATCH 2/5] cpuset: rebind numa vma mempolicy
	[PATCH 6/5] cpuset: rebind numa vma mempolicy fix
aka
	cpuset-rebind-numa-vma-mempolicy.patch
	cpuset-rebind-numa-vma-mempolicy-fix.patch
So far as I can tell, nothing is actually broken with this pair of
patches.  My cpuset function and stress tests still passed.  But they
are too hacky^W non-deterministic.
