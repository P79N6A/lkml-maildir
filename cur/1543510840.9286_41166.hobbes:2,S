No offense, but hearing you politely tell him to fuck off makes my skin
crawl, especially because noone here has any assurance that -YOU- will
stand behind Bitmover for the next 20 years. Businesses go under, are
acquired, and have their focus change.

Do you think any of us here care? Many of us are here, supporting a
non-commercial project, at non-commercial levels. I think you just
insulted most of us.

Get a few core developers here behind it (which would happen by necessity,
since people here would need improvements and modifications too), and I
see this as a very insignificant problem.

Refer to my previous comment about caring. I doubt many people doing
serious Linux development give a damn if there's a Windows 98/NT/2000 
port.
Or did you miss the original subject (you know, that part about a -Linux-
project management system?), and choose to simply plow on with your
marketing spiel whilst belittling someone who produces a competing product
to yours for free?
