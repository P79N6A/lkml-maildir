Now we'll have to have a compat layer for 32-bit/64-bit environments
thanks to POSIX timers, which is rediculious.
This is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping we could avoid when
designing these data structures.  No pointers, no non-fixed sized
types, only types which are identically sized and aligned between
32-bit and 64-bit environments.
It's OK to have these problems for things designed a long time ago
before 32-bit/64-bit compat issues existed, but for new stuff no
way.
