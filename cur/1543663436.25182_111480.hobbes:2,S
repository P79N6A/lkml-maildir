For icmp_xmit_lock it can be only done in a limited fashion - you are
always restricted by the buffer size of the ICMP socket. Also I don't 
know how to lock the socket from BH context nicely - the only simple way
probably is the trick from the retransmit timer to just try again
in a jiffie, but could have nasty queueing up under high load.
Fixing the error drop behaviour of TCP will be somewhat nasty too.
In both cases you'll need a retry timer (unreliable) or an dedicated ICMP 
backlog (complicated)
