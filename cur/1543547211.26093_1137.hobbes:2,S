Inside the Makefile, I see
===================================
HOSTCC  	=gcc
CROSS_COMPILE 	=
CC	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)cc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
=====================================
Therefore, the following is not allowed in the system
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root            3 Aug 31 23:19 /usr/bin/cc -> ccc
ccc is the C compiler from Compaq for Linux for Alpha.
What about having the following?
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
                         ^^^
instead of cc?
Best regards,
