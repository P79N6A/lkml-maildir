I tested it and got in the result the same problem. Well, no processes got 
killed by the kernel and the virtual memory didn't grow up to the end (as 
far as I could see it).
But every (other, regular) process crashed when it wanted to have some 
memory because it didn't get the memory. Or I wasn't able to start any new 
process - I even couldn't do a logon via ssh or a local login at the 
console.

All in all, the overcommitment - option seems to work fine (the machine 
responded well :-)), but it should restrict just the process which leads 
the machine to death. All other processes should be as free as before.

rsync allocates all of the memory the machine has (256 MB RAM, 128 MB swap). 
When this occures, processes get killed like described in the posting 
before. The machine doesn't respond as long as the rsync - process isn't 
killed, because it fetches all the memory which gets free after a process 
has been killed.
