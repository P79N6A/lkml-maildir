Has someone said that devfs was going to be removed from 2.4? Or are you 
confusing 2.4 and 2.6 in addition to being nasty and argumentative about 
one nit in a very large project.
I assume it will be changed in 2.6, if you want to criticise you left 
off the name of the existing feature in 2.4 which should have been used 
instead.
