I thing this was decided some time ago that we won't deal with this situation.
If we need to, the following needs to happen.
A) we need to follow a protocol to register the PID/TID id within the lock.
    Example of this is described in 
	"Recoverable User-Level Mutual Exclusion" by Phiilip Bohannon
            Proceedings of the 7th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed 
            Systems, 1995.
B) this again requires that some entity (kernel ?) knows about all locks, 
whether waited on in the kernel or not.
C) I believe we need a deamon that occasinally identifies dead locks.
Is it worth all this trouble? Or do we need two versions of the ?
The paper describes that for a Sun SS20/61 the safe spin locks obtained
only 25% of the performance of spinlocks.
