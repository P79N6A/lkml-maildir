Hi
 I'm having problems with my sb16, the kernel hangs when sb module is
loaded. When switch my computer off after i shut down linux, then after
that it would load the module and work flawlessy. It also works when i
reboot from windows95 to linux. SAK keys won't work either.. so its a
solid hang. Kernel is 2.2.2-ac7 and computer is a hewlett-packard vectra
vl rel. 6.MT. Are there any known problems with these computers?
cat /dev/sndstat shows me that...
