I've seen a couple of cheapo keyboards where some
Alt-SysRq-key combinations don't generate anything from the
keyboard.  (I'm typing on one of them right now.)
For example, Alt-SysRq-5|6 works, but 1,2,3,4,7,8,9 don't.
I've been told that it's just keyboard manufacturers trying
to save 1/2 cent each keyboard e.g.  :(
In any case, I have 2 patches that you might find useful.
One patch uses Alt-SysRq-Y to raise the console loglevel by 1
and Alt-SysRq-V to lower it by 1.
  
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/patches/sysrq-logupdown.dif
The other patch implements magic sysrq keys via sysctl.
E.g., "echo 9 > /proc/sys/kernel/magickey" sets console loglevel
to 9, and "echo m > /proc/sys/kernel/magickey" calls show_mem().
  
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/patches/sys-magic.dif
magickey updates go directly to the sysrq keyboard handler,
so all current keycodes are supported.
