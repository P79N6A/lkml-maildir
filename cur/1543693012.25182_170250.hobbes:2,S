You should definitely take a look at other drives data in all computers,
esp. temperature. Consult this with max allowed temperature as defined by
hd manufacturer for this specific type of the drive (should be somewhere
on their website or on google). Each disk is different but the general
safe bet for a limit is 40-45 oC, from what I know.
Your room may be cool but it's better to check.
