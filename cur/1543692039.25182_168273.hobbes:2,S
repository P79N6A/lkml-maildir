Hi,
Are there any patches available to read the battery status of a Toshiba
Tecra S1 laptop (module PT831C-11UDL)?
I currently have no way to read the battery time left - and when it runs
out the system comes crashing down -- ext3 to the rescue!  
The last kernel I tried was 2.6.0-test5.
Any help would be appreciated.
TIA
Bernt
