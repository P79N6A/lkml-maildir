Subject: [PATCH, BACKPORT] end-of-stack detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The oops dump code detects the end of the kernel stack with
    (addr & (THREAD_SIZE-1))
This fails if the kernel stack is not 32-bit aligned. This can happen if 
an APM bios call is interrupted and then causes an oops. The result is 
an unreadable and incomplete oops dump. 2.6 contains a similar fix.
Marcelo, could you apply the patch to your tree?
