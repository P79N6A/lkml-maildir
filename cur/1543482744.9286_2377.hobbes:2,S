I could not agree with you more.
Code is all about clarity, that means how rapidly can a reader
understand what the code is doing. Excessive comments mean that the
reader has to do more work. Good/consistent layout/style helps the human
'parser'. White space to separate 'actions/tasks', but too much white
space wastes screen space reducing what can be seen at a glance.
