After much research.. I have a question regarding /proc
I have a zombie process which has apparently died for some unknown 
reason.. I know it was terminated by a signal (found that from the 9th 
field (sheduler flags) in /proc/pid/stat)
However, I'm trying to figure out what signal killed it.
Also, it would be nice if /proc could show what the exit status of a 
dead process is.. seems strange that it doesn't contain that information 
(or am I just not seeing it in there).
Any info would be helpful.. thanks,
  Davy
