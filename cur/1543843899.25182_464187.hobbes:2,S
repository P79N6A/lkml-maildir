My proposal wasn't to delay to user read, just to do the time stamp in socket 
context. This means as soon as packet or RAW/UDP have looked up the socket and can 
check a per socket flag do the time stamp.
The only delay this would add would be the queueing time from the NIC
to the softirq. Do you really think that is that bad?
