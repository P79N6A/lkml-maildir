Fully agree. The API is the right one in my opinion, just simple
wrapping of the mapping and flushing when appropriate.

It's probably not widely seen outside of IDE, I would guess.

Might be even better. Shove regular eg kmap_atomic() into
__kmap_atomic() and add kmap_atomic() just calling that and
kmap_atomic_io() with an added flag for direction. Or an even easier
'hack' - use a separate KM type for these types of mappings and flush
always. Might need both IRQ and non-IRQ version, so probably not the
best idea. I'm inclined to vote for the first suggestion.
The point of it all is that there's no point in making this too fancy or
optimized, it would be a waste of time for an utterly slow and CPU
intensive path anyways.
