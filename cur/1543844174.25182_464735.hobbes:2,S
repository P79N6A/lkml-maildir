Subject: [PATCH] count defined zones to size ZONE_SHIFT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

With the recent changes allowing ZONE_DMA etc to all be optional,
the ZONE_SHIFT calculation is very hard to follow.  Playing with
the compiler, it seems that the following is portable and IMO
much easier to read and understand.

count defined zones to size ZONE_SHIFT
Simplify calculation of the number of bits we need for ZONES_SHIFT
by adding up the definitions of the defined zones.  We make use of
the property of defined(X) that its value is one when X is defined
and zero otherwise.  From the GCC manuals:
  "defined name and defined (name) are both expressions whose
   value is 1 if name is defined as a macro at the current point
   in the program, and 0 otherwise."
