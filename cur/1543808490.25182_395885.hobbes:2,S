Yes, it would make sense to run balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() inside
msync_pte_range().  So pdflush will get poked if we hit
background_dirty_ratio threshold, or we go into caller-initiated writeout
if we hit dirty_ratio.
But it's not completely trivial, because I don't think we want to be doing
blocking writeback with mmap_sem held.
The code under balance_dirty_pages() does pay attention to queue congestion
states, already-under-writeback pages and such things, but it could be
better, I guess.  Starting some writeback earlier if the queue is deemed to
be idle could work.
