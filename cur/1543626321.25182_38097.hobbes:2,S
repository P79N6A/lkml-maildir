The OEM 128 and 64 meg sitck of ECC that came with the machine works
fine. I got an aftermarket ECC stick that NT likes but linux doesn't.
Standard boot with no extra kerenl switches
and it's very slow and CPU load is 1.0

Booted with "kernel-2.4.18 mem=704M" at lilo prompt and it's still slow
Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=Linux-2.4.18 ro root=802
BOOT_FILE=/boot/kernel-2.4.18 mem=704M
is what dmesg cought.

I finally got the machine stable with SMP enabled in the kernel (had to
be a heat issue and the mobo shutting things down)
I'm about to compile and use  
http://www.anime.net/~goemon/linux-ecc/
 
to see if I can figure out what exactly is happening.
