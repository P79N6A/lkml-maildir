Not quite:
	copy_from_user(xxx);
Is my suggestion.  No error return.

Yeah, thanks to my kernel audit.  But I won't be auditing all 5,500
every release (I promised Alan I'd do 2.4 though: I'm waiting for the
next Marcelo kernel).

It's been documented in the kernel docs.  It's also in the device
driver book.  And people still get it wrong because it's "special".
Please please please, Linus: to me this is like the min & max macros:
you didn't want a programmer trap in there, but everyone else
disagreed.  If there's any sane way we can get rid of this trap (which
has shown to cause real bugs), I would weigh it very carefully.
Rusty.
