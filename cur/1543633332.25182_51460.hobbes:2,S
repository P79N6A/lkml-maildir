Most distributions ship slightly (or heavily) patched kernels.  Above you
can see the 2.4.4 kernel is not stock, it is named '2.4.4-4GB' for one
thing, which most likely means it is tweaked for a 4GB memory system?  That
may be how SuSE shipped kernels for 7.2, idunno.  But the point is, it is
likely that stock 2.4.4 would not work either, it would have the same
problem as 2.4.18.  There's some added bits in  SuSE's release kernel that
make >1TB NFS shares happy.  I'd suggest that you try booting 2.4.4 stock
just to see if it misbehaves the same way 2.4.18 does, and if so, start
trying to figure out what SuSE patch fixes this for you (check SuSE
specific lists, and/or ask their support).  With luck you will find that
either SuSE has a newer 2.4.x kernel with firewire support, or whatever
they've done that fixes NFS can be extracted out and added to a current
stock 2.4.x kernel source.
