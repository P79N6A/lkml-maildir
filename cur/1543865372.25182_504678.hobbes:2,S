It's wrong to call this a ring buffer as things won't be completed in
any particular order. So you'll need a fourth list head for which
buffer elements are free. At which point, you might as well leave it
entirely up to the application to manage the allocation of
async_syscall structs. It may know it only needs two, or ten thousand,
or five per client...
