There is no difference between SMP and non-SMP systems as far
as interrupt generation is concerned. You might have a hardware-
initialization bug that shows up only when you use some SMP
macros. Make sure you are using the proper macros to access your
hardware and not just pretending the return value of ioremap_nocache()
is a pointer (it's not, it's a cookie).
Also SMP adds some additional code. So, it might change the
degree of optimization that the compiler performs. You need to
use the 'volatile' key-word in cases where the compiler might
not otherwise know that something could get changed in an
interrupt.
