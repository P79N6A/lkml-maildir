local_t : adding and standardising local atomic primitives
These patches extend and standardise local_t operations on each architectures,
allowing a rich set of atomic operations to be done on per-cpu data with
minimal performance impact. On architectures where there seems to be no
difference between the SMP and UP operation (same memory barriers, same
LOCKing), local.h simply includes asm-generic/local.h, which removes duplicated
code from the current kernel tree.
These patches apply on 2.6.20-rc4-git3.
It depends on the patches "atomic.h : standardising atomic primitives"
