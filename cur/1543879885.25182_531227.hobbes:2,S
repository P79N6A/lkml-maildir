Currently the all the code is protected by CONFIG_HPET.
Are you proposing to use for example CONFIG_HPET_NVIDIA instead?
I think that the code should be safe even without it's own config option.
It won't override values from ACPI tables and can still be disabled with
nohpet boot option. Also all the code and data are __init.
