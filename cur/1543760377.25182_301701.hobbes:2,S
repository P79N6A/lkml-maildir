<snip>
It seems like this use of schedule_timeout() and the others are a bit
excessive. In this case, a timer is set to go off in 2 hours or so,
with tpm_time_expired() as the callback. tpm_time_expired(), it seems
just takes data and sets it to 1, which in this case is
chip->time_expired (and is similar in the other cases). We then loop
while (!chip->time_expired), which to me means until
chip->device_timer goes off, checking if the request is complete every
5 milliseconds. The chip->device_timer doesn't really do anything,
does it? It just guarantees a maximum time (of 2 hours). Couldn't the
same be achieved with (please excuse the lack of tabs, any real
patches I submit will have them):
unsigned long stop = jiffies + 2 * 60 * HZ;
do {
     u8 status = inb(chip->vendor->base + 1);
     if ((status & chip->vendor->req_complete_mask ==
           chip->vendor->req_complete_val)
               goto out_recv;
     msleep(TPM_TIMEOUT); // TPM_TIMEOUT could now be 5 ms
     rmb();
} while (time_before(jiffies, stop);
I think similar replacements would work in the other locations.
If people agree, I will send patches.
Thanks,
Nish
