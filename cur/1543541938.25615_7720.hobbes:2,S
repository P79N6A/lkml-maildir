The sb module can not load correctly as it should. Complains that it can't
find the card. But what is worse is that it leaves the machine in a bad
state, if you try to "cat /proc/ioports" afterwards you get a segmentation
fault.
The problem is that the module parameter "multiple" change it's default
value to 1 (in test6 it was set to 0), And in my case with a non-isapnp
sb16 card that means that it doesn't work any more. I guess that when it
tries to set up the second card something fails. I only have one card. 
Since most people only have one card maybe multiple should be set to 0 as
default. Or maybe some more logic that only continue to look for
soundcards when the first one was found with isapnp.
Can I have mutiple cards without isapnp? How do I give irq and such
parameters for the second card?
