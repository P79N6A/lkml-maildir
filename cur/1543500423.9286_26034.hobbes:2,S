I have, in the past, had problems similiar to this, but not timeouts
specifically. I've gone back to the kernel where I thought everything
was fine only to find the problem wasn't related to the kernel. It
just happened to coincide with the installation of a new kernel, and
was in fact faulty hardware.
My suggestion would be to go back to 2.2.6, unless you have some
compelling reason not to, and make sure it's a kernel issue, and not
just some hardware that went flaky on you just when you happened to
install a new kernel.
Just an idea. It'll certainly point directly to 2.2.9/10 if the
problem goes away after you install 2.2.6.
