The dangerous part is when a particular NMI interrupt is holding a
reference to the removed item on the list. Now, after *every* CPU has
been through a normal schedule, none of them can still be running /that
particular/ NMI interrupt: the fact they can be running other NMIs
constantly is neither here nor there, as newly generated NMIs can't see
the deleted element anyway.

As long as they're naturally aligned.

Zwane you're going to have describe a race if you think you can see one

-EPARSE. You will spend more time in the NMI handlers bouncing the line
across.
