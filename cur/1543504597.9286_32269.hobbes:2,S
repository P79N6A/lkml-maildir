In kernel 2.2.10 I am running PLIP over non-enhanced parallel ports
(non-bidirectional ports).
It seems that whenever I run tcpdump on the plip0 device my machine stops
receiving packets.  If I am pinging the remote machine while running tcpdump I
will see the ICMP-echo-request packets going out and the responses coming back,
but the ping program won't.  At that time no application other than tcpdump
will receive any data over the plip link.  This state will continue until I
down the link and put it back online again.
