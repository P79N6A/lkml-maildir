No, I just designed the oom_adj mechanism and left the implementation to 
experienced people.

The value is expeted to vary with the read time, since memory usage
does vary, too. If your sshd goes berserk and starts eating memory,
it may be smart to kill it. If it doesn't, the score should remain
about the same.

It is, as long as the score varies with the badness of a process.

As I said, if a program starts misbehaving, it's mostly not sane to keep
it alive. Besides that, the oom_adj allows you to special case some
processes to be immortal or to be kenny, but you should be prepared for 
trouble then.
