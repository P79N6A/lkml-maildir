Will try to crash SMP ASAP, I'm not able to do tests now.
I do erase/burn of 210 MiB rw disk. Erase is done without crash.
I use version 2.01.01a03 of cdrecord.
It crashes when burning:

Same crash occurs when I run oss2jack with -d option.
It does not occur when running without -d option (daemonize).
