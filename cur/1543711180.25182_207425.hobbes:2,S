Hum, I'm wondering if -k is fully functionnal (hdparm man page hints 
that this isn't supported by all drives and I don't remember any 
success/failure stories here).

SiS chipset : is APIC functionnal ? (cat /proc/interrupts)
If not, I believe this might be the problem and the solutions still 
eludes me (I don't think the problem lies in the IDE driver but in APIC 
support).
I've 2 SiS based mainboards forced to use XT-PIC (SiS735 and SiS645 
based) here but without this kind of problems (everything works until I 
start to add to many PCI cards in one system...). I'm willing to start 
hacking around (mostly on the 645 as the 735 is an always-on system).
Is reading the arch/i386/kernel/*pic* files (and probably others) enough 
to start or is there somewhere else to look for information ?
