| What about this ugly fragment?
| (assuming get_mctrl not called from IRQ)
 What's the problem with get_mctrl() being called from IRQ?
 Note that get_mctrl() is a callback and the driver is free to call _its_
get_mctrl() from IRQ if it wants to.
|   take mutex
|   take port lock
| again:
|   save local copy of icount
|   release port lock
|   get_mctrl
|   take port lock
|   if (icount changed)
|     goto again
|   update tty->hw_stopped
|   release port lock
|   release mutex
 Well, I think it'd work. But how can we keep track of 'icount'?
Should the driver add 1 if it updates 'tty->hw_stopped'?
PS: Sorry for the long delay, I was off last week.
