As far as I can remember the superblock is only read when the fs is
mounted. Changing the superblock when mounted doesn't reload it. Only a
mount does. This probably because chaging the superblock at runtime
doesn't make sense. 
You might want to look at the RAID code, as it does some nice magic with
superblocks.
