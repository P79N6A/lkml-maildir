The warnings in this case is valid but I would think harmless.  ZONE_NORMAL
on x86_64 begins at MAX_DMA32_PFN on the 4GiB boundary which is MAX_ORDER
aligned. From the e820 map, I am guessing the machine has 1GiB of memory
so the normal and highmem zones are empty. Andy's latest patches should
catch that.
The places where I now expect to see zone alignment error messages is
where the lowest PFN in a node is not aligned so the zone appears to
start unaligned. As the node_mem_map is aligned to the MAX_ORDER
boundary, we will see the warning, but it'll be harmless again.
I am struggling to see how the alignment patches or
arch-independent-zone-sizing would clobber the mapping of the ACPI table :(

"Too many memory regions, truncating" is of concern because memory will be 
effectively lost. Is this on x86_64 as well? If so, I need to submit a 
patch that sets CONFIG_MAX_ACTIVE_REGIONS to 128 on x86_64 which is the 
same value of E820MAX. This is similar to what PPC64 does for LMB regions 
(see MAX_ACTIVE_REGIONS in arch/powerpc/Kconfig for example). If it's not 
x86_64, what arch does it occur on?
