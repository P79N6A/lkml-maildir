Additional comment:
This oops is reproducable at my system. I tried today again, and again it
happened on the same EIP. If I got that right it is this code:
                if (status.b.check)
                        rq->errors++;
                idescsi_end_request(drive, 1);
                return ide_stopped;
        }
Obviously rq is somehow damaged. I tried to retrieve further info by adding:
/* $$$ */
                local_irq_enable();
                printk("scsi: %08lx, pc: %08lx, rq: %08lx\n",scsi,pc,rq);
                if (status.b.check)
                        rq->errors++;
                idescsi_end_request(drive, 1);
                return ide_stopped;
        }
Interestingly there are about 10 lines in syslog with this output, then it
stops for around 10-20 seconds, and _then_ it oops'es. I got the feeling that
this "late" rq is indeed long gone, when the code is entered.
I tried to patch a bit around this problem, but no success at this time...
