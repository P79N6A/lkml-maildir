I tried that some time ago and it turned out that some systems have
mappings in holes and don't boot anymore when you fill the holes too much. 
But that was only considering e820. if you do this it might work if you 
do it really like windows and consider all resources, including ACPI.

I don't remember why it is different. Probably wasn't intentional.
But in general x86-64 is less fragile than i386 here because it has the e820
allocator and can deal better with conflicts.
