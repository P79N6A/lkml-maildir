I've put Linux 2.0.37pre8 out on ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/linux/alan. This for
most people will be an uninteresting release. It contains a first cut
pentium III serial number disabler and also a fix for a bug in
the IP_MULTICAST_IF getsockopt. This point release is being done for the JDK2
folks whom the second bug bites.
Feel free to test it anyway. Just to make sure the PIII fix doesn't disable
both the serial number and some other machines.
