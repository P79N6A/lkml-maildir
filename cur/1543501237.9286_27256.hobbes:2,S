OK, here I am again w.r.t. this bug. Previously, I wrote:

It turns out that if I move the Iomega from its aha152x clone to
my main aha2940, the problem goes away. The obvious conclusion is
that the aha152x driver needs work.
For completeness: as far as I know, the lockups only occur after
some preceeding "heavy" stuff, as described in my original report.
If I just boot up, mount the zip drive and start big copying files 
to it, they don't occur. Maybe this helps to locate the source of
the problem.
