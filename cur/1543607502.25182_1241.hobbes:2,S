The best you can do, IMHO:
1. reserve a 3 GB chunk of memory at boot
2. create a regular user process
3. have that process make a system call which will never return
4. in that system call, wipe out all memory mappings in the process
5. hand-craft a 3 GB memory mapping (0 GB virt --> 1 GB phys)
6. call your desired code, remembering to schedule by hand
