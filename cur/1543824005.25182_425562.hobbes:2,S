ok so most of I2C commands shouldn't last more than 160 us when bus 
runs at 400 khz, right ? If so, I'm not sure it worth to use interrupts because
an active polling would avoid context switch that is not negligible in that case.
Interrupts can be usefull if I2C transfers would be longer than 8 bytes...

Indeed, my controller can automatically stop the bus clock when Tx fifo is
empty or Rx fifo is full.
