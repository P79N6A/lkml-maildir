Forget it. It is completely undefined in the architecture what happens
then. You'll lose interrupts and everything. Nothing for an operating
system intended to be stable.
I have no plans at all to even think about it for Linux/x86-64.

For DOS even a slow emulator should be good enough. After all most
DOS Programs are written for slow machines. Bochs running on a K8
will be hopefully fast enough. If not an JIT can be written, perhaps
you can extend valgrind for it.
Or if you really rely on a DOS program executing fast you can
always boot a 32bit kernel which of course still supports vm86
in legacy mode.
