On a highmem machine it it could be relatively common.

You don't want to change that for a stable patch, however.
It fixes the bug.

Or ever will. It wasn't that my whole argument against it is
based on that I mistakenly thought your patch served the bdev
inode directly from its backing store.

I just don't think what you have is the proper fix. Calling
into the core vfs and vm because right now it does something
that works for you but is completely unrelated to what you
are conceptually doing is not the right fix.
Also, the patch I posted is big because it did other stuff
with dynamically allocated ramdisks from loop (ie. a modern
rewrite). As it is applied to rd.c and split into chunks, the
actual patch to switch to the new backing store isn't actually
that big. I'll submit it to -mm after things stabilise after
the merge window too.
