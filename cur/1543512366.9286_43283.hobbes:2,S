I had the same problem with 2.3.18 under Mandrake 6.1. 2.2.12 worked fine.
my hardware configuration:
    Compaq EP-6400/4.3/64
        - P-II 400
        - BX-chipset with intel onboard ide-controller (i don't know which
for sure, windows says: 82371 AB/EB)
        - seagate 4.3 GB ide hd (udma enabled in bios)
I tried compiling with intel ide-controller support and with only the
standard ide-controller support, both gave
me the message: "unable to mount root fs on 03:06" under 2.3.18 while 2.2.12
worked fine.
the compiler i compiled the kernel with is egcs-1.1.2
Linux is installed op the second partition (/dev/hda2). And my lilo.conf has
the option "root=/dev/hda2".
Is there a bug, or did i overlook something?
Greating,
