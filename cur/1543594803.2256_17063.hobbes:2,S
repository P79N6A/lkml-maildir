Commercial reasons.  Cost per motherboard/chipset goes way up as the number of
CPUs supported goes up.  For each CPU that a chipset supports, it has to add a
lot of pins/lands, and chipsets are already typically land-limited.
Motherboard trace complexity (and therefore number of layers) goes up.  Add to
that that the potential market goes down as CPUs goes up.
You can buy 4-, 8-, and 16-way motherboards for Intel CPUs (don't know about
more).  But the 16-way ones will cost as much as a house.
