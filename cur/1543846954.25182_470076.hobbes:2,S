autotools is, in some places, not developer friendly. A V=1 feature like 
the kernel's makefile system has would be beneficial, as well as the 
possibility to use PIC-compiled objects for PIE-executables (which 
currently throws an error on some distros, and requires workarounds, 
like the *-nolibtool files in pam_mount)
