This has gone from bad to worse. Everyone involved in this thread (myself
included) is acting like a child.  Grow up.  You want to go have a temper
tantrum over a name, do it somewhere else creatively.  How about we throw
RMS, Linus and the rest of you into a steel cage deathmatch of doom, last
person standing gets to decide what to call it.   That would probably be
infinitly more productive than firing off e-mails at each other.  What is it
that you people want? A credit screen that scrolls your name/organization by
on bootup?  I'm not writing this to troll or flamebait, but at least I have
the testicular fortitude to speak up after lurking this one for too long.  I
for one would gladly pay $39.95 to see the RMS/Linus/everyone deathmatch on
pay-per-view.  That is the only way I can think of that would settle this
damned debate (and doubtless someone will say the match was fixed.)  Anyway,
I'm going back to lurk.
Remember, think before you hit reply.
Unless you have a good point in your reply don't expect me to answer.
Especially not back to the list.
