I agree that something must be done, but the problem underlined by
Matthew explains the approach Thomas and myself are pursuing at the
moment. Rather than plain requesting the resources at ACPI level and
see everything else break, we rely on cooperation by individual drivers
(or actually families of drivers) and try to fix the problems seen with
these specific drivers. This is more realistic.
