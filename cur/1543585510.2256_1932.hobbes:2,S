But still it gives faster transfers than /dev/hda. The question is why.
I do not think that factor 2 can be explained by prefetch or readahead
alone.

:-) But putting it at the beginning at least leaves the linux partitions
together.
Having the root fs in the outermost partition might give slightly faster
transfers, but slightly longer seeks to get there.
