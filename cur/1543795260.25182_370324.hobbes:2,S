So -q means "quick" ?
I wouldn't mind seeing a -quiet (even less quiet than V=0),
not even printing the CC, AS, LD, etc. commands -- just let the
tools print errors & warnings.  I always redirect output to a
disk file and filter it for errors and warnings anyway, so I
want hold my breath for this, but ISTM that V=0 could be even
quieter than it is right now.
