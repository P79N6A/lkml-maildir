Hi Ingo,
This series:
 1. Renames the alloc/release_{pt,pd} calls to _pte, _pmd so that its
    clear what they operate on.
 2. Adds alloc/release_pud, and puts calls in the appropriate places
 3. Demacros some stuff in pgtable.h
A bit eclectic, but all fairly straightforward (and no changes to
non-x86 headers ;).
Thanks,
	J
