A problem is that the audit tree (believe it or not) adds a pile of new
inotify functionality.  I don't know what those changes do and they might
conflict with the changes you've made (apart from giving us two copies of
inotify_inode_watched()) and the audit changes were apparently only
socialised on the linux-audit mailing list and my twice-sent patch to make
the audit tree compile has been ignored for a couple of weeks.
So I'm going to bitbucket the audit tree until a) it compiles and b) its
inotify changes have been explained and reviewed and c) we've reviewed
those changes against your optimisations.  I think fixes will be needed.
