In the process of setting up hooks, I have run across a very interesting
data point.  If I load %ds, %es, %ss in my hook the problem goes away.
But I must load all 3.
Given that the code sequence that is executed if my hook is not run is:
	cld
	cli
	movl $(__KERNEL_DS),%eax
	movl %eax,%ds
	movl %eax,%es
	movl %eax,%fs
	movl %eax,%gs
	lss stack_start,%esp
I am rather confused.  I am not changing the gdt or anything like that so it
appears I may have found a way to tickle a processor errata.
Anyway Andy if you have a second please try kexec-tools 1.3 and see what
happens when you pass it the debug option.  I am really curious if your lockup
is anywhere near mine.  I doubt it as I am running on a P4.  But it appears
you never know what the problems will look like until you test them.
