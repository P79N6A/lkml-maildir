    I've looked thru the specs and it seemed to me that ULi hardware is much 
broken PIO wise: their max active time is 8 cycles even on taskfile access 
which gives 240 ns while standard requeires 290 ns for modes 0 thru 2...
    I've also noted that the tuneproc() method in both cmd64x.c and alim15x3.c 
seems to misdo recovery calculation, taking address setup into account -- that 
should be slightly overclocking PIO modes 0/1 (ULi docs don't shed much light 
on how it should be calculated)... Well, this seems fixed in libata drivers.
