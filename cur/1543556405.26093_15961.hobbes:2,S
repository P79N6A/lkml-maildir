Hi,
I'm having trouble masquerading ftp-ports other than 20/21.
For some service i'm using, i need to masquerade port 42,43,62,63 for FTP
(I know it's weird...).
Now, when using 2.2.x kernels i could use
'insmod ip_masq_ftp ports=21,41,42,62,63'
but using 2.4.0-testx the 'ports=' parameter doesn't seem to work for
ip_nat_ftp.
Is there any other param I should use (couldn't find it in the docs ;(( )
Please cc me because i'm not on the list (only reading the
web-archives....)
Thanks,
Taco.
