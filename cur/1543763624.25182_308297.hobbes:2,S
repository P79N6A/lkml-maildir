I may need to take this back. I forgot to open the serial, so it wasn't
accepting input. So it would just appear dead. And the console was
fighting against the RT tasks, so it too would seem to be dead.  I've
reran the test on the latest, but this time I didn't have the NFS
mounted, and it's still running.
