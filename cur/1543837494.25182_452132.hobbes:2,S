When I type "Linux RTT measurement" to google, the following
very authoritative paper on Linux's TCP congestion control
shows up on the very first page:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/research/iwtcp/papers/linuxtcp.pdf
You should try a little bit harder with google next time, and
also ask your question on a more appropriate list such as
netdev@vger.kernel.org which is where the networking developers
are subscribed.
