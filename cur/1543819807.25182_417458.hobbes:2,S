Hi everyone,
I have a question with regard to using jbd (the journalling layer) apis. 
If you are using an external device then must the journal 
be located at the start of the device? I mean if I want to start the 
journal from block number 2 of a physical device then are there any 
particular initialization parameters I should watch out for?
Please advise and please CC the reply to my address as I am not subscribed 
to lkml.
many thanks,
Abhishek
