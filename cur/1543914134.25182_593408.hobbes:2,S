Subject: [PATCH] eCryptfs: Use generic_file_splice_read()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

eCryptfs is currently just passing through splice reads to the lower
filesystem. This is obviously incorrect behavior; the decrypted data
is what needs to be read, not the lower encrypted data. I cannot think
of any good reason for eCryptfs to implement splice_read, so this
patch points the eCryptfs fops splice_read to use
generic_file_splice_read.
