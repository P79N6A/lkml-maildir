Hi Ben,
I have exactly the same problem with my ieee1394 mass storage device.
To solve it, I did the same as Kai and replaced the drivers/ieee1394
directory for kernel versions later than 2.4.20 with those found in
2.4.20.
The problem seems to be the same with 2.6.x kernel series. I didn't
investigate this further, but I think I will be able to send to you
the reports needed the next days.
Holger
