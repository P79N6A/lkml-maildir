I'm not a kernel hacker so I don't know a whole lot about it but I
figured that these errors would be the cause of ndiswrapper not
working correctly since they appear even without it installed and not
to mention the odd behavior that occurs.  Depending on exactly which
distro or kernel that I am using, sometimes ndiswrapper will cause a
kernel panic and other times I can load the driver but no new network
interface would appear.  I suspected that the culprit would be that
the kernel isn't properly assigned my wireless card an IRQ.
From versions 2.6.11 through 2.6.15.x my system would not boot at all
unless I passed some kind of parameter (like irqpoll or acpi=off) and
it wasn't until 2.6.16 that this was fixed.  My line of thinking was
that maybe the problem still existed and that my USB wireless card
(SMC2862-W) was not being recognized.
I'm not a master of kernel messages but a few of the messages such as
the "mp-bios bug" and "cannot allocate region 3 of device" which
appeared during the boot process of several distros made me worry.
I'll report this to the ndiswrapper developers.  I'm sorry if I took
up your time.  I really appreciate your efforts.  Thank you for all of
your help.
