Quite frankly, from our history with ext3 and other filesystems, using a 
mutex in the filesystem is generally the wrong thing to do anyway. 
Are you sure you can't just use a spinlock, and just release it over IO? 
The "have to do IO or extend the btree" case is usually pretty damn clear.
Because it really sounds like you're lock-limited, and you should just try 
to clean it up. A pure "just spinlock" in the hotpath is always going to 
be better.
