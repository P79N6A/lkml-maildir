Good. Now it really does partition reading.
At some later time we must come back and find out what is
wrong with hd.c. You call the printk stuff unused, but
it was used and printed
partition start 63 size 4096512 type 85 p1
partition start 4096575 size 15904350 type 85 p2
partition start 0 size 0 type 0
partition start 0 size 0 type 0                          
Let us compare with your data from earlier:
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       365   2931831   83  Linux
/dev/hda2           366      1245   7068600    5  Extended
/dev/hda5           366       487    979933+  83  Linux
/dev/hda6          1185      1245    489951   82  Linux swap
Clearly, you have EZDrive installed, the table below is what
is found in sector 1, the data printed above is what is in
sector 0. The tables differ - fdisk was used after installation
of EZDrive.
I suppose that booting with boot parameter "hda=remap" should work.
At some later time we must worry about how to get rid of EZDrive.
