Hello!
> any chance to get a coredump ?
Been there... ld-linux in glibc-2.3.2 is broken: it does not understand
relocatable VDSO. If vsyscall-sysenter.so is not absolute, which is
the case with exec-shield patch, it dereferences not-relocated pointers
in .dynamic and segfaults.
BTW original Gerd Hoffman's patch as submitted by Rusty works
with libc-2.3.2, it generates good absolute VDSO.
