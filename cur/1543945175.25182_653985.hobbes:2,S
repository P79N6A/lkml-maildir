Also, I highly recommend adding some randconfig builds, at least one 32-bit arch 
and one 64-bit arch.  Any given randconfig build is not particularly likely to 
catch bugs that would be missed elsewhere, but doing them daily for two months 
will catch a lot of things before they get released.  The catch, of course, is 
that you have to actually save the .config for this to be useful, which might 
require a slight modification to your scripts.
