hrmm  strange because the only thing that could be causing the soundcard to 
skip would be irq requests still stuck in the cpu as far as i know.  I only 
get that with massive ide access and that's it.  Also that is when linux is 
juggling them all equally.

I ran it myself and i dont drink alcohol or take drugs.  so yea, i'm sure :)  
If i went high enough i suppose the same problem would occur.  it's probably 
in an area of the kernel where the preempt patch doesn't work (yet).    It 
does happen on cdparanoia -Z -B "1"    I dont think anything ide is safe from 
that.
