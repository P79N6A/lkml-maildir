Just what I was thinking...

While 16550 serial is a bad example since it does byte accesses only (and thus
doesn't suffer from endianness), I have no problem to imagine there exist
platforms where you have multiple instances of a `standard' (cfr. 16550 serial)
device block, while each of them must be accessed differently:
  - one of them is in PCI I/O space (little endian)
  - one of them is in PCI MMIO space (little endian)
  - one of them is on-chip MMIO (big endian)
  - one of them is somewhere else, but sparsely addressed (some bytes of
    padding between each register)
and we can for sure come up with a few more examples of weird addressing.
How to solve this, without cluttering each ioread*() with many if clauses?
