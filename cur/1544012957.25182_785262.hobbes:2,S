Yes. That wasn't obvious from my problem description?

My patch copies the early fixmap mappings to the new page table. Isn't
this enough?

It's OK, if fragile, in early boot where it uses alloc_low_page.

Would be fine by me, although I want to get a minimal patch working
in the meantime if that is going to be complex.

Go wild if you'd like to spend time optimising x86 PAE ;)

This is not an option really. Anyway, it's not more than 32 CPUs, but
can be a problem with as few as about 8 depending on config.

So did you actually see anything wrong with my last patch which catches
discontiguous page tables and copies over the early fixmap translations?
