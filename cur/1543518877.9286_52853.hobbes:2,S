Subject: 2.3.31 (and 2.3.32pre2) breaks cpp with segmentation fault (ok in 2.3.30), reproducable (mremap problem???)

something (mremap?) broke cpp between 2.3.30 and 2.3.31
 (2.3.30 is ok, 2.3.31 causes segmentation fault in cpp)
Compiling and testing perl has proved useful to find bugs/problems
with new linux kernels.  This is the first time I get a repeatable
Segmentation fault from gcc (the preprocessor at that!) 
after upgrading to a new kernel. (older kernels don't have
this problem.)
Whould the changes to mremap have caused this?
 (the reason I ask this is the last system call before cpp 
  segfaults was mremap)
Here's a little info about my kernel and environment
Linux dd 2.3.31 #1 Sat Dec 11 11:12:12 PST 1999 i686
gcc version 2.7.2.3
/lib/libc.so.5.4.44
extract latest perl5.005_63.tar.gz from CPAN
cd perl5.005_63
make clean ; sh Configure -Doptimize='-g' -de  ; make test
observe failed build 
  cc: Internal compiler error: program cpp got fatal signal 11
if I
 strace -v -f 
the command that failed, but make it obvious that I want to just test the
preprocessor "-E"
 cc -E pp.c
The same process can be repeated with earlier perls
 (I tried  perl5.005_62.tar.gz also)
The latest 'stable' perl5.005_03.tar.gz and perl5.005_57.tar.gz did
not fail in the same way)
tar -zxf perl5.005_62.tar.gz
cd perl5.005_62 
sh Configure -Doptimize='-g' -de
cc -E pp.c
strace -v -f cc -E pp.c 2> /tmp/pp.trace
reports the last system call before the seg fault as
 mremap(0x40122000, 1074929664, 700416, MREMAP_MAYMOVE) = 0x40122000
I don't think one should blame perl for causing a seg fault
in cpp when running linux 2.3.31 when the same code runs
fine when running 2.3.30.
Can anyone else reproduce this also?
