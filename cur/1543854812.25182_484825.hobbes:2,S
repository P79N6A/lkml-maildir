In the time line, we currently have
start_kernel()
   ...
   setup_arch()
      init_bootmem()              # alloc_bootmem starts working
      ...
      paging_init()               # needed for vmalloc
   ...                            #
   mem_init()
      free_all_bootmem()          # alloc_bootmem stops working, alloc_pages
				  # starts working
   kmem_cache_init()              # kmalloc and vmalloc start working
   ...
   system_state = SYSTEM_RUNNING
The one interesting point here is where you have to transition between
calling alloc_bootmem and calling the regular allocator functions.
Maybe calling it slab_is_available() was not the best choice for a name,
but I don't see a point in having different names for essentially the
same question, "bootmem or not bootmem". The powerpc platform has an
integer variable called 'mem_init_done', which expresses this well
IMHO, but it's currently not portable.
Checking for SYSTEM_RUNNING is obviously the wrong choice, since it is
set at a very late point in bootup, long after bootmem is gone.
