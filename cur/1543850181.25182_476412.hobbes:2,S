The worst case is 3 * sizeof(unsigned long) *
number_of_swap_extents_allocated bytes.

That depends on a lot of things: the size of swap space, the amount of
low memory available to begin with and so on.
I would simply say that 
1) the likelihood of the worst case is extremely low, particularly in an
age where swapspace is generally useless except for in suspending to
disk. If it was higher, your question would be much more poignant;
2) if the worst case happens, we should handle it properly, backing out,
freeing whatever we've allocated and returning control to the user, just
as we should if allocating a bitmap were to fail.
