Hi Linus, hi others,
  I was left this week in the country with small 486SX/25 notebook
with 8MB of RAM and with sources of 2.3.11... (it takes about 4
hours to compile my config of 2.3.11 under 2.2.10). There was 
couple of problems, of which these three are still unfixed in
2.3.11-pre1 (most amazing was (already fixed) missing cpu_init()
in SMP kernel without SMP hardware; next one was missing 
page_unlock in vmscan - is there anybody who knows why it is
not possible to print stacktrace through sysrq key in standard
kernel?):
(1) in 2.3.11, there was missing cpu_init() in code path invoked
    on SMP kernel without SMP hardware. This is now fixed, but
    there is still missing
      smp_num_cpus = 1;
    in this codepath :-( Kernel works fine without this (:-)),
    but libproc complains about inability to determine HZ and
    top coredumps because of divide zero (divide by number 
    of cpus when computing utilization)
(2) because of compilation take 4 hrs on that hardware, and only
    thing it did was Starting init... reboot..., I tried to build
    minimal working kernel (with PF_UNIX, but without SYSCTL).
    I found two sysctl symbols unconditionaly exported from
    netsyms.c
(3) fs/ncpfs/dir.c is (still) missing NULL pointer test
  Except that, 'optically' is 2.2.10 on that hardware much faster
than 2.3.11, but if I left it alone to recompile kernel,
compile time of same configuration take 4 hrs under 2.2.10, but
(less than) 3 hrs under 2.3.11. Excellent work.
