I'd have to say that it really depends on whether the caller can
handle negative return values.  Did you check/audit the callers too?
If it's a well-defined Unix/Linux error code (like s/ENOMEM/-ENOMEM/),
this should be made to work (at least in most cases).
And don't change ones that use ERR_PTR, like this:
-		return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
+		return -ENOMEM;
Local variable returns of positive/negative are probably not correct...
without auditing the callers, it's hard to say.  E.g.:
-	return ErrFlag;
+	return -ErrFlag;
(same type of change in DAC960 driver)
I'm a bit suspicious of:
-	return EOF;
+	return -EOF;
and
-		return E05;
+		return -E05;
It's not just a global search & replace...
One more thing... did you build and boot that modified kernel?
If so, did it build with the same number or fewer warnings than the
unmodified version?
