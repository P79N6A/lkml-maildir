Won't work.  module->live is what Rusty uses to indicate that the module 
is in the process of unloading, which is when we *do* want the attempt to 
module_get() to fail.  I think the process out to basically be:
load module into mem
set module->live = 1
call module_init
export module syms
done loading module
on module exit:
unexport module syms
set module->live 0
call module_exit
free module memory
done unloading.
That *should* solve all the races Rusty is trying to solve without the 
problems we've had so far, but this is only after a few minutes of 
thinking....
