no real reason that i can recall - i guess nobody dared to touch it 
because it used to have that 'volatile', indicating black voodoo ;-) Now 
that the bad stigma has been removed, we could try the patch below. It 
boots fine here, and we save 1K of kernel text size:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  6236003  611992  401408 7249403  6e9dfb vmlinux.before
  6235075  611992  401408 7248475  6e9a5b vmlinux.after
I can understand why no data is saved by this change: gcc is aligning 
the next field to a natural boundary anyway and we dont really have 
arrays of spinlocks (fortunately). [and we save no data even if using 
the ((packed)) attribute.] Perhaps some data structure that is never in 
the kernel image itself still got smaller? Any good way to determine 
that?
But why is the text size different? Ah: i think it's spin_lock_init() 
getting shorter :-)
but this is certainly not something for 2.6.22, it's an early 2.6.23 
matter i suspect.

Subject: [patch] spinlocks i386: change them to byte fields
all spinlock ops are on byte operands, so change the spinlock field to 
be unsigned char. This saves a bit of kernel text size:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
6236003  611992  401408 7249403  6e9dfb vmlinux.before
6235075  611992  401408 7248475  6e9a5b vmlinux.after
