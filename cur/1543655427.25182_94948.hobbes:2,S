Well it is about timing indeed. It turned out that as a result for
a quest for speed, some time ago, I left the pci bus running as 35Mhz.
As soon as I reset it to 33Mhz the attached drive was detected and
kernel panics dissapeard. (Redhat kernel 2.4.18..., 2.4.20-ac1. )
Other I have not tested.
thanks for your help
