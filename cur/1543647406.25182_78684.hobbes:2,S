The entire point of O_STREAMING is to let user space specify
policy.  If user space user space knows with 100% certainty that
the data being read/written from a particular file descriptor is
use-once-and-discard data, then it makes sense to honor that
hint.  In this case, user space knows best and can set policy on
a per file descriptor basis.
Note that most applications do not want to use this flag.  But
for a few applications it just just perfect.  For example, if I
am playing a DVD there is absolutely no point in the kernel
trying to cache the content of the DVD.  A DVD has way too much
content for caching it to do any good, and since most people
watch a DVD once through from beginning to end, there is no point
stuffing the DVD's content into the pagecache, thereby crowding
out other things that should remain in cache.
