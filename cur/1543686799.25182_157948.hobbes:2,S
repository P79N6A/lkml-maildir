I don't recall .config falling out of a grep for that.  I also asked 
less to search for it in .config without finding it.  This was in 
2.6.0-test3-mm2's src dir.
I reran a make menuconfig and saved, and a trial make is underway now.
Damn, grep must not look at .files, its there, and still 14.  Thanks a 
bunch, new build underway.
However, I'd assume a make mrproper, or an oldconfig might reset that 
to the include/config/log/buf/shift.h value?  Its also in 
autoconfig.h FWTW.
