I have doubt about this too, but it's was git bisect zero into. All I
know is a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388 is definitely good.

I'm lost reverting this. Right now, I'm just use "git diff" and throw
away everything after a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388, and my
system can STD, STR without an problem resuming.
