I do love the design.  Certainly an improvement over what we currently 
have in all ways I can think of.

Correct me if I am wrong on this.  But if there was simultaneous 
multithreaded reading on a single file would it look non sequential and 
not trigger readahead?  For instance if on a 4 processor system 4 
threads were each reading 1/4 of the single file sequentially.  Would 
this be exception case number 4?
I don't know if this is a common scenario, just a plausible one.  I also 
don't know a good way to deal with it.  Current code is just as 
susceptible to it in any case.  Nothing to hold up putting this in, just 
curious if somebody knows how we might deal with it properly.
