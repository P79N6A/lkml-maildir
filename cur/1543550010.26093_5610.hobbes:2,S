it might make sense even in production use. If there is some calculation
that has to be done only once per month, then sure the customer can decide
to wait for it a few hours until it swaps itself ready, instead of buying
gigs of RAM just to execute this single operation faster. Uncooperative
OOM in such cases is a show-stopper. Or are you saying the same thing? :-)
