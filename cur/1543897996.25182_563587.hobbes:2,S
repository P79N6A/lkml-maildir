It's not a space issue -- it's just a question of
clutter.  Even though I've been the maintainer for coming up
for 2.5 years now, Andries was still doing the uploads onto
kernel.org until about a year or so ago.  I think Andries used
to clear down old versions periodically just so it was easier to
see which version was the latest.  Since I started doing
the uploads, I hadn't cleared away any old versions, but 
yesterday I noticed that the list of files in the directory
is getting long, so that it's hard to see what version is latest.
So I created the directory "old" and moved all the old stuff in 
there.  Alexander notes that this causes some problem for the LFS
folk, since their scripts expect the tarballs to be in stable
locations for longer periods.  (I was of course unaware of this.)

There is no automation on my part.  Each time I do a release, I
use scp to upload the .tar.gz and .lsm files, and some kernel.org 
scripts automagically create the .bz2 and .sign files.
To maintain any sort of link will either require me to
write some script, or manually create the links.

Yes, I'll write a script to create suitable links.

Well, I think all that LFS seems to want is links that are
stable "for a while" (since I don't suppose that they want
to use really old tarballs in any case). So, for 
the benefit of LFS, I'll just be less aggressive about
moving tarballs into "Old" (I'll leave them sitting in 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages/
for a few months at least.)
Cheers,
Michael
