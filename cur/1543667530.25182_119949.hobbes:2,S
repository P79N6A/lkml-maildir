I see your point, and I'd love to get this stuff merged back to mainline
2.4, and that would actually be the whole point of doing this ... to
provide a channel of stuff that should get merged back. The other thing to
bear in mind is that what I want is not really another to turn 4 branches
into 5, it's to turn 4 branches into two branches with a couple of twigs
off each ;-) So I actually want *more* commonality.

If Marcelo would like some more help from others for integration / testing
whatever, I'm sure it could be arranged if he described what he'd like. I
know that helps me out a lot at least if I can get others to help me ...
(eg. take these 5 patches, merge them on top of my latest prerelease, and
kick the snot of them for me to see if they're basically looking OK). 
There's plenty of talent and enthusiasm around on LKML that's able to share
the burden ... would be much more constructive than us (myself included)
complaining ;-)

PS. If Andrea's VM fixes are a good candidate, that people are seriously
interested in, I'll get myself and others here to give them a beating.
