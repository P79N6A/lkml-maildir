I think (and I could be wrong, I have been once or twice before) that
what you are describing is separate from the issue I am talking about
and Patrick Mau reported.
In the current BK (not 2.5.40) I believe Linus merged a patch from
Andrew that changed /proc/stat syntax.  This will break old vmstat
binaries.  You need to upgrade to the above version, at least.
