Well it does seem to receive the DHCP reply.

It has been consistently working properly for a long time with various
kernels (and the e1000 driver).  I've now swithed to 2.6.24-mm1 and
e1000e, and it's almost consistently broken after boot and resume, and
sometimes needs several tries (with the KDE NetworkManager thingy) to
make it work.
My guess is that either NetworkManager is buggy, or there's something
else in -mm that's breaking NetworkManager.  But now it does seem
unlikely to be an ethernet driver issue.
Thanks,
