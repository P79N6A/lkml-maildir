Move is very similar to rbind + umount.  So if you find sane semantics
for the rbind case, that should do for move as well.

I don't understand this.  A bind will just copy a vfsmount and add the
copy to some other place in the mount tree.  It should not matter if
the original mount was automounted or not.  What am I missing?

No.  With bind you copy the mount to another place.  Now it has
nothing to do with the automouter, it becomes a perfectly ordinary
mount.
