i've implemented a read-ahead algorithm for mmap, and it appears to be
working pretty well for applications that mmap a file then stream data
from it (like mpg123).  now i have some "implementation detail" questions
for the list.  in no particular order:
+  read-ahead is triggered half a cluster before the end of the
   previously read segment.  is this too far in advance?
+  after scheduling the next window, should filemap_nopage run the
   disk queue, like do_generic_file_readahead?
+  should the mmap read-ahead logic reuse the read-ahead context 
   contained in the file struct, or should it maintain separate
   context in the vm_area struct?
+  should this logic be overly concerned about protecting the
   read-ahead context from race conditions?  a race condition
   is more probable here than in do_generic_file_readahead
   because this code handles shared memory areas.
+  what's a reasonable maximum window size?  right now i've set it
   arbitrarily at 256K.  would it be worth it to allow up to a megabyte
   per read-ahead?  or maybe the maximum value should be parametrized
   to the size of physical memory, just like page_cluster?
