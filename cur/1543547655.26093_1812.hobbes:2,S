Yes.

The utils go in a tarball _you_ maintain. The utils don't strictly belong
to the kernel - only some of the most frequently used are mirrored
on kernel.org.

An alternative would be putting the util-only sources in a separate tarball
and let it use the kernel-level source files. Something like
VPATH = ${srcdir}:${kerneldir}/fs/nwfs
on the top of your Makefile might help.
