I can't see anything like this in the code.  Can you send a patch to fix 
what you think the problem in the is?
The effect you describe can be caused by other tasks running on the 
system (see below for fuller description).

This is one of my standard tests and it works for me.  The only time the 
two normal priority tasks end up on the same CPU during my tests is when 
some other normal priority tasks (e.g. top, X.org) happen to be running 
when load balancing occurs.  This causes an imbalance and tasks that 
aren't actually on the CPU get moved to fix the imbalance.  This is 
usually the test tasks as (because they are hard spinners) they have a 
smaller interactive bonus than the other tasks and get preempted as a 
result.

Both of the problems you describe above are probably caused by the fact 
that there are other tasks (than those in your tests) running on your 
system and if they happen to be on a run queue at the time load 
balancing is done they will cause an imbalance to be detected that is 
different to what you expect based on a simplistic view of the world 
that only considers the test tasks.  When this happens tasks will get 
moved to restore balance.  This (in my opinion) is what you are seeing.
