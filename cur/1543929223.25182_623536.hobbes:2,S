I have a binary module that uses dev_get_by_name...it's sort of a 
bridge-like thing and
needs user-space to tell it which device to listen for packets on...
This code doesn't need or care about name-spaces, so I don't see how it 
could really
be infringing on the author's code (any worse than loading a binary 
driver into the kernel
ever does).
I would certainly prefer to not have to patch around any problems with 
calling dev_get_by_name
from a non-gpl module, but if required, I can probably figure something 
out...
Thanks,
Ben
