There's filesystem readahead in fs/buffer.c (__breadahead()),
although I don't see any actual callers of it.
However, I'm guessing that you are actually thinking about the
anticipatory IO scheduler (as), which is found in
drivers/block/as-iosched.c.
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c also does some readahead (READA) work.

Nope.
