I think you are forgetting that the system does the full context switch from the 
interrupt handler (well, actually from entry.S) and does not do the irqd until 
it is time to go back to the idle thread (i.e. there is nothing left to do), so..

What we loose here is that idle does not go around its little loop again.  If an 
interrupt becomes pending on the way to the hlt, i.e. while entry.S has 
interrupts masked and is doing the irqd, it will be handled prior to the hlt so 
we could loose several of these idle loop spins, until no interrupt is pending 
allowing the hlt to be executed.  On the next interrupt/irqd the hlt will exit. 
  So what is lost is one or more spins round the idle loop.
The "normal" idle loop just looks at the need_resched flag and goes right back 
to the hlt, however, idle, it self, never sets this flag, only interrupt code 
can set it at this point, and the interrupt exit takes action to clear it so I 
don't see it every being found set in the idle loop (I suppose one could do a 
test to see if it is ever found set here), so, in theory, the net effect should 
be nill.
Did I miss something?
