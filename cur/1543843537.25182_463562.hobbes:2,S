The claim that these tracepoints would be maintainance burden is pretty 
much unproven so far. The static tracepoint haters just assume the kernel 
will be littered with thousands of unrelated tracepoints, where a good 
tracepoint would only document what already happens in that function, so 
that the tracepoint would be far from something obscure, which only few 
people could understand and maintain.
