The usage of "valid ram" here is confusing - that's not what PageReserved
is all about.  It's about valid RAM which is managed by method other
than the usual page counting.  Non-reserved RAM is also valid RAM, but
is managed by the kernel in the usual way.
The former is available for remap_pfn_range and ioremap, the latter is
not.
On the other hand, the validity of an apparant RAM address can only be
tested using its pfn with pfn_valid().
Can we straighten out the terminology so it's less confusing please?
