		Firmware	5.06-0-52
		Utility		4.78-08
		10 disks 36GB each divided as following:
        	0	140956  5 Drives	Write Thru
		1	140956  5 Drives	Write Thru
		9 of these disks are handled into an external cabinet
		1 disk was into the main processor box.
		When file system created:
		8 file system of 36GB each. This is an example of 
		File systems hadled by Pack 2:
		Disk /dev/rd/c0d1: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 17968 cylinders
		Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
		        Device Boot    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System

Swap area:
	4 partitions of 100MB each
Special used drivers:
	DAC960 2.0.0 Beta 4 from www.dandelion.com 
	Special thanks to Leonard N. Zubkoff (lnz@dandelion.com)
	for the quality and reliability of this new driver.
Special used software:
	fdisk v2.8 caontained with DAC960 driver
	MTX 0.07 package from www.dandelion.com/Linux (again Leonard)
	
Tests completed without problem to report:
	Save of 40GB on DLT tape and retrieval
	Fill up a 36GB file system, copy it on another file system,
	compare both file systems, delete target file system contents
	(rm -r)
	Unplug a disk meanwhile system copying. Replace this "damaged"
	disk by a new disk.
	Power off the system meanwhile heavly used.
		Recover time: 30 minutes for a 36 GB file system full of data.
		(there are 8 file systems)
		
Hardware pending troubles:
	The external cabinet has room for 9 disks. The 10th disk was
	installed into the main processor box.
	All disks were linked together using eXtremeRaid 1100 channel 1.
	Unable to prepare the System disks from the 2 5 disks packs.
	We got all the time: disk nn goes offline
	We linked the 9 external disks to the eXtemeRaid 1100 using
	channel 2 meanwhile we keep the internal disk on channel 1
	Channel 3 is free.
Software pending troubles:
	FDISK 2.8 (dandelion version size 158979)
	Accepted the above geometry, but is not able to reread it. 
	Declares all the time:
		The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 4942.
	No impact on mke2fs as long we know the declared disk geometry
	(write that on paper, keep it in a safe place)
This system is working perflectly since 5 days.
