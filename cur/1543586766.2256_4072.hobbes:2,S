This concept I think is used in Solaris .. as they have dynamic loadable
schedulers..

Hello
Just dump idea - why not make scheduler switchable with modules - so
users
could select any scheduler they want ?
This should not be that hard and would make it easy to replace scheduler
at runtime so everyone could easily try what's the best for him/her.
