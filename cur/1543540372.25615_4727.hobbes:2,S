Greetings Mr. Diddler.  Doing some diddling today?
If you're looking for brown paper bags, you have two choices from
lkml.  1) You can download Brown Paper Bag 2.2.0, 2.2.1 from any
linux kernel mirror out there.  2) You can wait until 2.4.0 is
finally released.  I'm sure that the first release or two will
be brown paper bag releases.
I seriously hope you have multiple ISP's, because you likely just
lost the one you're currently using.
Diddler.
