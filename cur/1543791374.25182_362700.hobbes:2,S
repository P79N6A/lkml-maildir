I missed the earlier discussion about this when it appeared on lkml.
This is no doubt a widespread problem, and it should be brought to many 
people's attention.  Greg, can you think of any good way to make this more 
visible?  Maybe a short piece in Linux Journal combined with a more 
eye-catching $SUBJECT in lkml?
Maybe this could be combined with a brief discussion of the open-remove 
race as well (and the use of BKL to help resolve it).
