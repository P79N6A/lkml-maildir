It's not as bad as it looks.  All the altsetting entries for an interface
are guaranteed to have the same value stored in desc.bInterfaceNumber, so
it really doesn't matter whether that value is retrieved from the first
entry in the altsetting array or the current entry -- provided of course
that cur_altsetting is a valid pointer!  It's mostly just a matter of 
taste.  I generally prefer to use cur_altsetting because that's the one 
currently installed in the device.
