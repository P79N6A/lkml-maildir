I am sorry for missing some description here. In simple words, the
HID_QUIRK_IGNORE let usbhid do not register some hid devices at all,
however, the HID_QUIRK_SKIP just let usbhid skip matching with the
device which is marked that quirk, but still register this kind of hid
device. So another HID driver still handle have chances to handle it.
You can discover out there, the hid-core.c is not pure HID driver, it
also take the transports role here.
I think this quirk have such difference with others, so I define it so.
If we do like so, just change it. That is OK.
May be, we need another hid_skiplist[] ?
