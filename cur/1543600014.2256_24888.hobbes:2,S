It's basically changing ownership (in terms of "which inode owns
which blocks") of blocks. 
There is just no POSIX-API to do this, that's why there is no
simple way to do this.
Applications handling such large files usally implement a chunk
management, which can mark chunks as "unused" and skip them while
processing the file.
What's needed is a generalisation of sparse files and truncate().
They both handle similar problems.
For now I would seriously consider editing the ext2-structures
for this, because that's the only way you can do this right now.
