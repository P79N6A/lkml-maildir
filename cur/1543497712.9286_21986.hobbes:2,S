Subject: .ident's taking up kernel space

I noticed when looking at the uncompressed zImage, that the
compiler has inserted lots of identification stamps
(Seemingly at the end of every .o) Compiling with a -S argument,
and examining the asm output I see .ident directives at the end
of each file.
Is there a switch that can be entered into the kernel makefiles
to suppress all this, as it does take up quite a bit of space.
I tried the -Qn, and -fno-ident switches which made no difference.
regards,
d.
