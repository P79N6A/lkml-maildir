Forgive me if this seems a really dense question, but with the new
unified page cache, is the buffer cache completely obsolete?  There is
still a number for it in top and vmstat (which comes from /proc, I
suppose) which seems to increase practically without bound as block
devices are read. I assume the number is bogus now.
Also, I am trying to understand how much difference this actually makes
as far as memory usage is concerned.  On a "typical system" (yeah, right
;-) how much duplication of cache was really occurring.  And is this
significant for low memory systems as well as large memory ones?
Thank you for any enlightenment.
