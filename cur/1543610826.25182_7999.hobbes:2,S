I wish you luck. About 18 months ago I offered to set up a testing group
to take kernel source before it with up for ftp and to compile it on
various x86, SPARC{32,64}, and ALPHA machines to be sure it would at least
compile. I was told with varying degrees of rudeness that it would delay
the releases (that is a GOOD thing in stable kernels), and that I should
avoid the 2.4 series and use the "stable" 2.2 kernsls (2.4 IS a stable
kernel of course, although you would never gues it).

I do agree, of course. There's no reason to avoid -pre releases, but
having -rc versions would be really useful because people who are waiting
for features would then be motivated to test, knowing that only fixes will
be applied. NOTE: this might mean that 2.4.18-pre1 would be out before
2.4.17 was actually released. That may bother some people.
A stable kernel should have only new drivers and not a whole new VM, at
least until it is in a development series and has been tested. If it were
up to me I would have opened 2.5 when 2.4.0 was released, and all the VM
stuff would have happened there. That's just the way I would assure
stability, knowing that there is no lack of people to test Linux kernels
no matter how unstable and patched... But a little truth in labeling would
be nice, recently the "really stable" kernels were -ac, and that's
probably not desirable.
Maybe the time is right to separate -pre and -rc and let people who who
want to test choose which, if either, they want to try. Some stuff really
MUST be tested on production machines (the recent VM versions, for
instance) to see which performs better and provide useful feedback.
