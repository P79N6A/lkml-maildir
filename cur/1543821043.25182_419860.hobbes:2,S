Quite possibly. What about an installed kernel (apart from the
modules)?  Will the kernel image and map, etc, get installed into
the "INSTALL_MOD_PATH" as well?  It doesn't sound, intuitively,
to be so from the environment variable name.

    Fair enough, but I'm more interested in where to specify
the target location of the installed kernel and System.map as
I don't always have modules for a generated kernel, but usually
(near 100% :-)) have an installable kernel image.  For development,
I could see it being useful to mount the target system's root in
a local directory (like /mnt), then have the kernel build install
to a target root of "/mnt".
Tnx,
Linda
