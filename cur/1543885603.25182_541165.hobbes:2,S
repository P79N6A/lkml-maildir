On trying to build a 2.6.21.1 kernel using the configuration at 
http://pcburn.com/files/kernel/breaks.2.6.21.1.config
 I'm getting the 
following error with Networking Support -> Bluetooth Subsystem Support 
-> HIDP protocol support set to built-in:
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
net/built-in.o: In function `hidp_add_connection':
(.text+0x8bb08): undefined reference to `hid_ff_init'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Works with that option turned off.  Also, the GCC version I'm using is 
the current Debian Etch release: gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) 
(Debian 4.1.1-21).  I also tried it with gcc (GCC) 3.4.6 (Debian 
3.4.6-5) for the same result.
I don't need to build that, so I simply unset it.  If this is at all 
useful and you need something else just CC: me in the reply.
Thanks,
-- Chris
