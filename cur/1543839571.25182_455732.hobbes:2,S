Looks OK to me.

I am not sure about these re-arrangements - I'd need to review them in
full context to make sure that we don't inadvertently change things as
it relates to behavior on integer overflows, which I presently do not
have the time for.  I'll trust that you do such a review with integer
overflows and variable type differences (size, signedness) in mind now
that I've mentioned this potential danger. ;-)  Alternatively, you can
simply change the comparisons from < to <= and from > to >= rather than
use the BAD_ADDR() macro.
Thanks,
Alexander
