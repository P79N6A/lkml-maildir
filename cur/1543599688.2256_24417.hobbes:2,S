Don't bother.  The problem is that your disks are IDE disks and you 
don't have IRQ unmasking enabled on some/all of them.  As long as that's 
the case, heavy disk activity (whether it's a RAID5 resync or a bonnie 
run or untar'ing a kernel archive) will always cause your PPP connection 
to quit working due to dropped serial data and therefore corrupted PPP 
packets.
