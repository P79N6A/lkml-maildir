.. which wouldn't help you either, supposing that you don't want to touch 
the kernel sources at all, because this function is unexported and static.
So I think that there is no straightforward way, sorry.
Is this a device that doesn't exist anywhere else than on your table? I 
still think that putting the code in kernel (if possible) and blacklisting 
the device on the hid_blacklist[] is the simplest way.
The other possibility is writing the driver completely in userspace, using 
libhid/hiddev. Would that suit your needs?
