I'm under the impression that Erich is under the impression that they've all
been addressed.

So this is progress.
Erich, can you please fix these things up and then re-review the issues
list which I'm maintaining in
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17/2.6.17-mm2/broken-out/areca-raid-linux-scsi-driver.patch,
make sure that everything has been addressed?
If there are some things in those lists which you cannot/will not address
then please identify them and give us the reasoning behind your decision.
