I've thought about this as an option, but when I first started this
thread It seemed like the two could work independently, and safely which
doesn't appear to be the case any more.
The problems with pulling out the PI in the RT mutex are that
pi_setprio() does a walk over lock->owner and we're got two different
lock structures now . I was thinking we could add something like
lock_ops (get_owner(), wait_list_add(), wait_list_del(), ?? ) to
rt_mutex_waiter, or abstract rt_lock. Then pi_setprio would just use the
lock_ops instead of accessing a structure .. 
I've only gone over the Fusyn code briefly , so I'm assuming all this
could be added.  I think it's a safe assumption though .
