Subject: [PATCH 21/21] [MMC] Remove duplicate error message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/21/169

When there is remaining blocks untransferred, we get two error messages
saying almost the same thing. Make sure at most one is shown.
