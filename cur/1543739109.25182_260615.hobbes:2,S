Hi John,
Did this break recently, or did a previous ACPI-mode kernel work
properly?
With ACPI enabled, try "acpi_skip_timer_override"
With ACPI enabled, try "noapic"
With ACPI enabled, try "nolapic"
If you can send me a serial console capture with "debug" for the failure
case, that would help.  With any successful boot, the dmesg might be
helpful, and the output from lspci -vv and acpidmp is also helpful.
acpidmp is in /usr/sbin or in pmtools here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
You can send this to me, and/or attach them into a bug report here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
and assign it to me.
thanks,
-Len
