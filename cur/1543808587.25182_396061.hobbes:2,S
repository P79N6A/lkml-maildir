I just thought about fork() as Alan (surely and others) told the IDE bus cannot
run several commands at a time. So fork() was the only left-over I could think
of. I didn't know some devices can kinda 'detach' themselves as long as the
blank is going on...
Things are clear now. OK, more clear. Not clear. ;)
