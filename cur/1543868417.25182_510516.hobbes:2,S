Well, there's still little clue about why this is causing a NULL pointer
dereference.  The only thing I can think is that somehow performing
this test is causing a power glitch to your CPU, causing its registers
to get corrupted, and which results in it doing a NULL pointer deref.
Are you saying that the NULL pointer occurred while executing this code?
If not, where does the NULL pointer occur?

Andrew's said no (in that the thread you refer to) and suggested an
alternative, I've said no, how many more 'no's do you need to turn
you away from the wrong approach?

The "weird effects" were never quantified, so that's one of the reasons
I ignored that report (another being is that I stopped being the serial
maintainer a while ago, and now serial is maintainerless.)
