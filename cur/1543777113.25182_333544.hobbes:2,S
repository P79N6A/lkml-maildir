Agreed, will worry about architectures where they might not be later.

Fair enough!
The thing I am (perhaps foolishly) trying to do is get to a single
source base that provides PREEMPT_RCU under both CONFIG_PREEMPT and
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT.  Since you are OK with RCU disabling interrupts,
I am happy.

Will try to keep it down to a dull roar.  ;-)

And stock -51-7 just passed nine rounds of kernbench + LTP on some 4-CPU
x86 machines, with one still running.  Good stuff!!!
