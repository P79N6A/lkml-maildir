This machine experienced another random reboot today, nothing in the
logs or on the console etc.  This is the 3rd time now since I upgraded
from 2.6.11.3.  Is there any way to debug something like this?  I'm
fairly certain it's not hardware-related.  Might this have something to
do with the st problem?
Thanks,
