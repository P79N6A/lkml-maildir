Correct. sys_init_module() ends up returning an error to
/sbin/modprobe, which trickles down to request_module() if it was
invoked via kmod. The module doesn't get loaded, but at least the
error message states which module it is, and as you say, at least we
don't oops.
I think that not oopsing is pretty important in a case where a goofy
but technically valid configuration (compiling Unix sockets as a
module, and trying to boot with a rootfs containing a version of
/sbin/hotplug that requires Unix sockets) collides with an obscure
kernel implementation detail (initcall ordering).
