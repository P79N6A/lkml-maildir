Hi
I did search the archives, but it does seem to be the new one. r8169 
network driver introduced in 2.6.19-rcX a set_mac_address function, which 
doesn't work for me. It should resolve the bugreport 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6032
 but, as you see from the 
last comment from the original reporter and from my following comment, it 
doesn't seem to. I think, it should either be fixed or reverted. My 
test-system, was a ppc NAS (KuroboxHG):
0000:00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)
