FYI, I did this for a version of Union Mount.
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/20/21
) I was maintaining the readdir cache in
struct file and the cache was persistant across readdir calls.
Do you have anything different in mind ?
Also all our readdir discussions have kind of terminated with how
it could provide a correct directory seek behaviour. I was thinking
that we could dis-allow seek on union mounted directories
but was told that it is important to provide proper seek for
union mounted directories. So do you plan to address this seek problem
in your simple/first readdir implementation ?
