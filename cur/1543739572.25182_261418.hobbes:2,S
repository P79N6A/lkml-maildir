The only extent to which I'll agree you have half a point - is in the
fact that the kernel does have to worry more about licensing issues
these days. I think it's plain crazy and delusional to suggest that
there is a secret lawyer driven motive behind the 2.6 implementation
however. That said, I've not taken my anti-brain rays tablet yet today
so that might just be what they want me to think.

What sucks about it? That you didn't bother to read about how to use
it, or that it's fundamentally got some problem you can offer a
solution to?

This isn't a Fedora discussion list. Several folks here work for
RedHat but that's not an excuse for having a Fedora rant here. If you
dislike what you downloaded - go buy a supported product and call tech
support.

Geert suggested a quick fix for displaying the compilation process. I
admit that I didn't like not seeing the compiler output on first use,
but then you grow used to the newer build process and come to like it
- and can always read through the Makefiles to trivially figure out
how to display the compiler output. The 14 minute claim reeks with
some feeling of an alternative reason - perhaps you're doing this on a
box with some weird symlink to a dying nfs server or goodness knows
what, some more information would help debugging.

Oh no! We'd better call the Microsoft police in to fix this and make
it all ok again. How will we all cope having to give additional flags
to ls? Can't you remember all 26 flags off the top of your head
anyway? ;-)

Right. We'll need to be throwing away the dummy.o stages and a lot of
other kernel code too then. Looks like it's all crap according to you
so no big loss - meanwhile, in the real world, the kernel build
process has used cunning hacks for years. As long as they're more
cunning than a cunning fox, it's all ok.

Let's get this right: you get fed up with Fedora didn't you? So you
decided that all the kernel hackers must be part of a secret lawyer
driver conspiracy to create an evil build system that's out to get
you? Cool.

I have enough to take the flamebait all the way. Sorry folks.

Still, not bothered and bitter enough to not have the above tagline.
Look at me! I've got a big processor!
