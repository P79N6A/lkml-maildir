I sent the previous email from suse.de but like for the previous
emails in this thread, I was only speaking for myself. I followup
myself to specify this explicitly because if I did any major or minor
mistake in my reasoning in this thread, I want to be clear that you
must only blame me personally. The previous from got automatically
caught up by the reply headers.
