Well, it's a common feature across all current IBM PPC64 machines.

Don't worry about the firmware; the driver won't have to interact with
firmware itself, that's the job of the ppc64-specific platform code.

By platform code I meant the code under the arch directory that knows
the details of the I/O topology of the machine, how to access the PCI
host bridges, etc.  How and where it logs the error is a platform
policy; on IBM ppc64 machines we have an error log daemon for this
purpose, which can do things like log the error to a file or send it
to another machine.

If there is a permanent failure of an upstream link, then maybe
generating unplug events for the devices below it would be a useful
thing to do.

The choice is really to leave the slot isolated or to panic the
system.  Leaving the slot isolated risks having the driver loop in an
interrupt routine or deliver bad data to userspace, so we currently
panic the system.

How will the driver reset its card?

Sounds fine.
