Hi, Alan 
But can we know if dev->irq is XT-PIC ?  or not ? 
or could we know if IO_APIC or LOCAL_APIC is enabled or
not ?
on linux-2.6.17/drivers/pci/quirks.c    
  * we must mask the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE value versus 0xf to get
  * interrupts delivered properly.
  */
 static void quirk_via_irq(struct pci_dev *dev)
 {
        u8 irq, new_irq;
I want put here something like:  if ( dev->irq != XT-PIC) return and
don't quirk this dev.
        else 
        new_irq = dev->irq & 0xf;
        pci_read_config_byte(dev, PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE, &irq);
