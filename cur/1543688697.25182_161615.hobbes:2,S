Thanks.   It's a very straightforward bug; I'll fix it with the below patch.
A wider question is whether we should have got this far into the filesystem
code if the fs is mounted read-only.  A check right up at the VFS
setxattr() level might make sense.
Regardless of that, this fix is needed because journal_start() could fail
for other reasons.
