Hi all,
 I'm picking up on a conversation that was started in late March
 this year, and which didn't get anywhere much.
 See
   
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/31/93
 and following.
 The issue is that it is possible for an NFS client to lose writes
 if a particular race is lost - and this has been seen in real life.
 The patch discussed in the above mentioned converstation made two
 changes, one of which was completely right.  The over was slightly wrong. 
 Having explored the issue in some depth I now see how it was wrong
 and present below for your enjoyment two patches.  One which makes 
 and justifies the first change.  One which makes and justifies a
 revised version of the second change.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
