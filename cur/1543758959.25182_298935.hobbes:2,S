Fine with me - but I tend to run mm kernels anyway to get the "latest". :-)
Now, if this implies linux 3.0.0 won't ever happen, how about getting
rid of the major number?  It serves no purpose if not used at all. (I don't
consider the VB thing realistic . . .)
Or, if you want to keep the major number for consistency with earlier
kernels, consider:
2.<even>  minimally intrusive patches
2.<odd> big changes needing a month
<odd>.x big changes that destabilize over several releases
2.x.y takes the role 2.x.y.z has today.
