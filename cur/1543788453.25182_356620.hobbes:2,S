My testing showed the same number on hiwater_vm, but hiwater_rss from
Hugh's version was consistently ~1.5% lower. Where was the loss?
The fact that i have consistent hiwater_vm and hiwater_rss
in a few hundreds of processes suggests that that test may not
be a good test for comparing hiwater_vm and hiwater_rss.
I guess it allocates same amount of memory up front in every sub-tests
processes and never get over it. However, it also showed the way Hugh
did hiwater_rss in new code missed something.
Tomorrow i will be very busy at my work. I will be back on this
next Monday.
