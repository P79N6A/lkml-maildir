Agreed, I think it's pure luck that Xen kernels have gotten away with it
in the past.
The patch below seems like the right thing to do. It certainly boots in
a domU without the DMI problem (without any of the other related patches
such as Alexander's).
However ddcprobe hangs when run -- need to investigate some more, vm86
in general works ok (i.e. my vm86 test code passes).
BTW Jeremy, the kernel doesn't use XENMEM_memory_map -- any reason other
than it not being useful at the time? These days the tools can push an
arbitrary e820 down for a guest which might be useful to support,
although nothing interesting is done with it today.
Ian.
