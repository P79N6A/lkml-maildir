Subject: [PATCH 04/23] r/o bind mounts: stub functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/619

This patch adds two function mnt_want_write() and
mnt_drop_write().  These are used like a lock pair around
and fs operations that might cause a write to the filesystem.
Before these can become useful, we must first cover each
place in the VFS where writes are performed with a
want/drop pair.  When that is complete, we can actually
introduce code that will safely check the counts before
allowing r/w<->r/o transitions to occur.
