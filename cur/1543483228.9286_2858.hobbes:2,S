Metoo. I like to keep control about the routing, but with 2.1.121 or
so the kernel claimed to know better. Of course it had no idea about
the wished dial on demand configuration and broke the routing with
each new autoloaded network interface. Some very ugly workarounds 
(especially for Linux) became necessary within pppd and ipppd.
