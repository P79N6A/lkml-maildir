Hi,
  I'm seeing a lot of:
	kernel: request_module[net-pf-10]: fork failed, errno 11
in syslog, despite the fact I a) I have no IPv6 compiled in the kernel,
and b) have "alias net-pf-10 off             # IPv6" in
/etc/modules.conf.
  This is using a stock 2.4.18 kernel.  I was under the impression that
the /etc/modules.conf line would lead to such things as above not
happening.  Is the network code doing something slightly askew with
modules?
thanks,
-Ath
