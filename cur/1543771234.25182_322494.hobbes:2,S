It would happen on any architecture supporting XIP from flash.
The XIP code therefore polls the IRQ controller (with IRQs masked out) 
and whenever an IRQ is pending the flash operation is suspended and IRQs 
unmasked.  In this case the hard IRQ latency is function of the flash 
suspend delay which is documented in the datasheet.

It would crash if the kernel is XIP.  If not XIP then the 
local_irq_save() is never encountered in that case.
