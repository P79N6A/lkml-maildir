Doesn't the provided solution is just a in-kernel variant of the
SCHED_FIFO set from userspace? Why kernel should be able to mark some
users as having higher priority?
What if workload of the system is targeted to not the maximum TCP
performance, but maximum other-task performance, which will be broken
with provided patch.
