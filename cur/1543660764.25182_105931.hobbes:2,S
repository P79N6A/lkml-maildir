/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build _is_ a good default for a module to build 
again. It is correct in more cases than a simple failure to do anything.
For _installing_, the correct place to install the built objects is surely
/lib/modules/$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION) where the 
variables are obtained from the top-level Makefile in the kernel sources 
you built against.
You _default_ to building and installing for the current kernel, if it's
installed properly. But of course you should be permitted to override that 
on the command line.

I disagree. Modutils will look in only one place -- the /lib/modules/... 
directory corresponding to the kernel version for which you built each 
module. Each module, therefore, should go into the directory corresponding 
to the version of the kernel against which it was built.
Finding the appropriate _installation_ directory is trivial, surely? You 
can even find it from the 'kernel_version' stamp _inside_ the object file, 
without any other information?
