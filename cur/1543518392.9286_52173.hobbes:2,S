Nasty, nasty, this one may well be beyond me.  
Tested different machines, different scenarios, different kernels, etc.
The problem is smp related, compiling in smp, (running on up), the machine locks up.  Re-compile kernel for non-smp, (the only change I made to the kernel config was to turn smp off), and now everything works fine.
The problem was also there in 2.3.26.

Send it over, I'll give it a whirl.
