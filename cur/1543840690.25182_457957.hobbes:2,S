What diagnostics did you try? 
(I've got experience with a guy saying: "I have 5 which test perfect
with my diagnostics, but my embedded machine refuses them. What's
wrong?" All of them report through SMART that they HAVE reported media
errors, and they all have bad blocks.)
Do you have "smartd" running? I vaguely remember that it sometimes
triggered error messages from the normal driver.
