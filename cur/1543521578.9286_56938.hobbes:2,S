It seems to be getting something it doesn't like from this strace below.  I
had the same problem with xwave until I said something about it on my es1370
(2.2.7 kernel SMP)
open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY)              = 3
ioctl(3, SNDCTL_DSP_GETBLKSIZE, 0x804c7c4) = 0
write(2, "bplay: invalid audio buffer size"..., 33bplay: invalid audio buffer
size) = 33
