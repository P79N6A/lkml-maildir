Thanks very much for the info!
So the longest we can delay, according to this spec, is until we have two full
sized segments.
But with the change we are discussing, could an ack now be sent even sooner than
we have at least two full sized segments?  Or does __tcp_ack_snd_check delay
until we have at least two full sized segments? David, could you explain please?
