I do not quite follow you here.
For a while I have considered implementing something that told why a
given file was compiled - like:
 CC     net/ipv4/ip_gre.o   due to net/dsfield.h, net/xfrm.h
 CC     net/ipv4/raw.c   due to include/config/ip/mroute.h
The latter is a config option that I do not see a possibility to change
back to a config option syntax (at least not without doing some effort).
My thinking was that 'make V=2' would give above printout.
But what you request is something that keep the dense printout without
building the kernel - right?
Any suggestion for an intuitive syntax to enable that?
'make -n V=2' will not do it.
