wchan shows where the process is sleeping - probably a kernel mutex or
lock here. This doesn't help much, but the stack signature will.
Enable and use the sys-request mechanism (via terminal, keyboard or
serial) eg sysrq-T to dump the stack frames of all processes,
including this.
Unsurprisingly, it's documented in the kernel Documentation directory.
