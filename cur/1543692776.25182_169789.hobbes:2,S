Something appears to be malfunctioning in your system, if you're getting 
DMA timeouts.
The first thing to do is try the latest versions of libata.  libata in 
-ac and -pac trees is ancient at this point, and I desperately need to 
send Alan and Bero updates.
Here is the latest Serial ATA driver ("libata"), at its FTP site:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/
Patches are against BK snapshots of the 2.4 tree, so you may need to 
manually patch drivers/scsi/Makefile and drivers/scsi/Config.in...
Let me know if you have more trouble after updating the driver.
	Jeff
P.S.  This driver is also shipped in Fedora Core beta 2 (a.k.a. what 
would have been Red Hat Linux 10), so libata/ata_piix kernel srpm and 
rpms are available at
ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/redhat/redhat/linux/beta/severn/en/os/i386/
