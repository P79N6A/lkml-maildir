Are you using the mcd or the mcdx driver?
At 2.2 times, I also had such a drive.
But I didn't observe any need for the mcd driver that was already 
outdated at that time.
The mcd driver should perhaps have been removed 10 years ago when the 
mcdx driver was introduced. You could start today with deprecating the 
mcd driver instead of a quick removal of this driver. But why? The 
question is whether the number of people using one of these drives with 
a 2.6 kernel is above zero or not - not whether we need one or two 
drivers for them.
