Not _necessarily_ a collective work. But not necessarily _not_ a
collective work either.

You're back to the 'derived work' thing again, which wasn't relevant.

I think it's quite clear that the intent of the GPL _is_ to 'muddy the
waters', as you put it, and to indicate that bundling stuff together
_should_ put the non-derived parts under the GPL too; at least in some
circumstances. But still, nothing's true until it's ruled by a court.
