It's funny that windoze went for years
without anybody ever realizing about
the 49 day crash - heck, one crash
every 49 days is lost in the noise on
a windoze pee cee - no wonder they
never noticed.
OTOH, when our Linux uptimes went back
to zero at 497 days, I noticed immediately,
and screamed bloody murder until I found
it was just a timer wraparound.
