Looking at some very very old scripts I wrote for clean loading binary 
modules I see some code to fix this:
dmesg -n 1
# do the module loading
dmesg -n 6
But, it assumes the syslog/klog is not running (well, you can temporarily
stop it) and also it starts minilogd temporarily and then kills it and
restarts syslog/klog.
Try it and see if it works for you. About 2-3 years ago it definitely 
worked :)
Kind regards
Tigran
