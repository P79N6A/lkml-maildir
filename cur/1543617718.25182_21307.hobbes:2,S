 I was under the impression that the Intel ACPI folks had things in
 mind for acpitable.c along the lines of 'rm', in favour of having 
 their new interpretor do a "Load, setup, get the hell out" approach
 for those that didn't want it staying around.
 Either way, I agree improving our ACPI support is a better solution
 in the long run.
