It means I or r, not I modified by r. This means either a immediate constant
0..31 or a register, which is correct.
% cat t18.c 
f()
{
        asm("xxx %0" :: "rI" (10));
        asm("yyy %0" :: "rI" (100));
}
% gcc -O2 -S t18.c
% cat t18.s
...
f:
.LFB2:
#APP
        xxx $10
#NO_APP
        movl    $100, %eax
#APP
        yyy %eax
#NO_APP
        ret
