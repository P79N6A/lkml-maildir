I'm trying to implement a weird filesystem feature - storing data on a
secondary media. Basically my modified filesystem can have a file who's
data is not present on a filesystem, but instead is dynamically restored
from elsewhere when the file is being opened.
The way I'm trying to do it is in 'open' if a file does not have data it
communicates with a user-level program (via pipe like in userfs) that it
needs the data. It then gets a userspace address. At this point I'm
calling a write with the same 'struct file *filp' that was passed to
open and a userspace pointer pl.p that was communicated to kernel from a
different process:
if (!access_ok(VERIFY_READ, (char *)pl.p, pl.l)) {
	  printk("tfs: cannot read from address %lx\n", 
		(unsigned long)pl.p);
	  return -ETFSRFAIL;
	}
if ((ret = filp->f_op->write(filp,(char *)pl.p,pl.l,&filp->f_pos))
	    != pl.l)
	  printk("tfs: WARNING write failed, %d\n", ret);
This fails inside the 'write' (and write returns -EFAULT) because the call
to copy_from_user returns the same number as it was requested to copy from
user space (despite access_ok returning true):
c -= copy_from_user (bh->b_data + offset, buf, c);
if (!c) {
			brelse(bh);
			if (!written) {
			  printk("tfs_file_write: -EFAULT, bytes read=%d,
written=%d\n",
				 c, written);
			  written = -EFAULT; 
			}
			break;
		}
I understand that this probably happens because the buffer with data that
I'm trying to write to the file belongs to a different process then the
file descriptor (and current). My question is how do i make this
copy_from_user to actually copy the data, or is there a better (i.e.
working) way?
Thanks for any help!
