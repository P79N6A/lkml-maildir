Subject: [PATCH] nvram driver and extended HDD data
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The NVRAM driver tries to print the user specified (non BIOS ROM table) hard
disk geometry for type 47 (or higher) configurable hard disk entries.
Problem is that there is no standard as to how these values are encoded
into the CMOS RAM, and so each BIOS manufacturer does it as they see fit.
(read as 'does it differently').  So the output (via /proc) prints random 
garbage for anything other than AMI BIOS at the moment.
Thus IMHO, interpretation of this data belongs in user space, and not in
the kernel and so I killed the lines printing user specified hard disk
geometry parameters from the driver.  Patch is against 2.4.2.
Paul.
