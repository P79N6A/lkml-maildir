*lol*. Interestingly they must have twiddled the IP stack since when I
tried an "nmap" on the device, it didn't recognize it as a Linux TCP/IP
stack.

So you grabbed that bootlog from the ASUS device, or from the D-Link?
If it is from the ASUS, what makes you think that the D-Link runs the
same OS?  It is quite often the case that one chipset design has
multiple operating systems ported to it (you see systems with the same
broadcom or Intersil chipset, one running Linux, the other VxWorks).
Please indicate how you came to the conclusion that the D-Link really
runs Linux.

I'm downloading it right now, and I'll see whether I can find any Linux
in there.

Sure, it's (unfortunately) not the first time I'm dealing with D-Link on
their GPL [in]compliance :((

If the design really is identical enough to the ASUS device, then I
suggest looking into
http://dlsvr02.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-530g/GPL_1825.zip
