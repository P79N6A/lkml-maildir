Userland? And who's using vanilla kernel headers in userland? Duplicates 
maintainers can always fix stuff independent of kernel (and I do).

The end user uses a distro that does these things for him. If not, he needs to 
know his way around with finding working kernel headers, otherwise he won't 
be able to build anything (he surely isn't able now - which btw you're trying 
really hard to ignore).
I don't get your point.

Yes. The more stuff gets separated, the less work duplicates maintainers have. 
Once all userland stuff gets extracted, those maintainers won't have anything 
else to do, maybe except releasing their final version and using it for 
backward compatibility. And that's what we're aiming at.
