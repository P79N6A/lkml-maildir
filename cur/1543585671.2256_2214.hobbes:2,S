No reason at all ... I'll have a look.  I don't have my ThinkPad any more
(as of yesterday) so someone will have to supply the DMI info to match.
I will add another field to the apm_info structure that the DMI code can set
and then just test for it in the APM event loop.
Note, however, that there will still be a latency of up to a second
before we discover this situation as that is how often we poll the
BIOS for events.
