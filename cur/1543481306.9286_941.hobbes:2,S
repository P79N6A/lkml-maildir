Subject: 2.2.0-pre9 compile failure on drivers/video/fbcon-iplan2p{2,4,8}.c

	drivers/video/fbcon-iplan2p{2,4,8}.c do not compile on the x86
paltform, because they #include <asm/setup.h>, which is not included on
the x86 platform.  Reverting to the 2.2.0-pre8 versions or creating an
empty include/asm-i386/setup.h file fixes the problem.  Either fix is
trivial.  The question is one of what the policy is on <asm/setup.h>:
should it exist for all architectures?  Should it used the way
fbcon-iplan2p{2,4,8}.c do (apparently to import some #defines about
the CPU type)?
