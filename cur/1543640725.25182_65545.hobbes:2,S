Try replacing "network" with "/dev/zero" to see how your sentence
sounds, and then maybe the flaw in your reasoning will become apparent.
  "If you have an embedded system that is headless, etc., then your
  only remaining source of entropy is /dev/zero."
Well, sometimes there is just no reliable entropy source on hand.
Maybe it's better to admit that than to fool ourselves.
