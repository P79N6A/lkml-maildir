Pavel, I think it is an delusion. In practical terms we have
a string of -pre and traditional releases which differ really
little in terms of reliability. I number of 2.5.x without -pre
fail to compile different non-core modules. 2.5.9 hangs on boot
on my machine, while -preX worked.
Marcelo pays more attention to stabilizing suffixless releases,
and as well he should. However, I do not see how this can
be meaningfuly done in 2.5.x. I am not going to shed any tears
over the demise of -pre in unstable series, provided that
releases get spaced tighter, with smaller patch size between them.
