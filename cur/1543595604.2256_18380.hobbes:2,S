I'm having trouble understanding the difference between these.
Synchronous apparently causes try_to_wake_up() to NOT call
reschedule_idle() but I'm uncertain what reschedule_idle() is doing. I
assume it just looks for an idle CPU and makes that CPU reschedule.
What is the purpose of wake_up_sync? Why would you want to prevent
reschedule_idle()?
