Not yet. I wasn't expecting to need the list quite this soon.

True, but I would expect to see a strong correlation between the use of
"obsolete" syscalls and the use of "obsolete" libraries (libc4, libc5).
Until there's a list of obsolete syscalls, we can't say for sure,
though.

There are at least one or two distributions (I'm thinking of vendors
named after headwear, although there are probably others) that have not
shipped libc5 compat libraries for a long while. IIRC they're also
shipping their kernels with CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT completely disabled
(not even modular).
So, these vendors at least are (to the best of my knowledge) only
supporting older applications *up to a point*.

It's going to be hard to tell without full-blown code to examine and
test, but my hope is that it will be able to disable something
substantial for people who have completely abandoned libc4/libc5. And
that's many users.
Even if the final patch is unable to benefit many users, perhaps the
process of creating that patch will still be worth it if it gives us a
better idea of which syscalls are being used and which ones aren't.
