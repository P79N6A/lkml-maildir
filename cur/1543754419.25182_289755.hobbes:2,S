Read the udev man page section, the part right before "FILES". Try
putting a script under /etc/dev.d/default/*.dev. Then you can get more
specific with an /etc/dev.d/scsi/*.dev script or something else.
I just tried something simple but did not get it working.
Try linux-hotplug-devel@lists.sourceforge.net list for help.
