Keeping a consistent namespace is cowardice?  And ClearCase is an
example of an application which sets up it's own namespace and grafts
it onto the standard Unix one.  Most standard Unix tools work just
fine inside clearcase Views, but to manage the metadata (xattrs, or
whatever you want to call them), you need to use the 'cleartool'
command.  Hmmm... sounds like 'runat' to me.

This is all pure marketing speak and economic theory.  Show us the

Define atomic please, with state diagrams and clear examples.

I think you've got it backwards.  Make your serious semantic
enhancements first, then make it stable, then make it fast.  Because
when you change the semantics, you break all kinds of things and then
it doesn't matter how fast you are.

Monkey see, Monkey do then.  
I'd like to point out another successful company which has extended
the standard Unix namespace and that's 'Network Appliance' with it's
.snapshot directory structure.  It's a great idea and allows my users
to restore files from snapshots without me having to think about it.  
But it still causes problems since when I use rsync to move data, I
need to put in stuff like:
  rsync -az --exclude ".snapshot" --delete --delete-excluded <src> <dest>
to make sure it doesn't descend into that directory of previous
versions and try to copy them over as well.  And of course now now
other apps can use the .snapshot name.  But what if other vendors aped
(ook ook) this decided to use their own names?  Who decides which gets
priority?  
I think you need to go back and re-read Pike's paper on namespaces
that you pointed to before and mull it over.  And look at how
simplicity is inherently powerful.  If the design is too complicated,
you're probably doing it wrong.
