We don't really have an appropriate one.  So I've invented my own.
 104 files changed, 338 insertions(+), 7335 deletions(-)
(and 228k).  That seems inappropriate to post.
Here's the whole patch (includes deletions from every architecture):
http://www.parisc-linux.org/~willy/generic-semaphore.diff
Here's the interesting/useful bit.  I've only tested it briefly on my
laptop -- it could be full of holes, but I've tried very hard to think
of all the interesting edge/race conditions with multiple
sleepers/wakers.
Please review.  I won't be around to respond to comments for another
four days.
