Yes. Enabling this only on relatively newer CPUs is safer. Will do that in next iteration of the patches.

Yes. We can check that at load time. But they can still do bad things at runt ime, like say when 3D gets enabled etc??

Checking the manual for this. You are right, we had missed some steps here.
Actually, manual says on MP, PAT MSR on all CPUs must be consistent (even when they are not really using it in their page tables.
So, this will change the init and shutdown parts significantly and there may be some challenges with CPU offline and KEXEC. We will redo this part in next iteration.
