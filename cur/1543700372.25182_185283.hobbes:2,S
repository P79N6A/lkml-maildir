This is typically a problem with your XF86Config because many read from
both /dev/psaux AND /dev/input/mice concurrently. However, in 2.6,
the data from /dev/psaux is included in /dev/input/mice, so all mouse
events appear to be recorded twice.
Just remove the entry from the ServerLayout section, and restart the X
server.
