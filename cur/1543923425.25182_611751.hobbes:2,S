This is exactly why I wish this patch had been posted to
netdev@vger.kernel.org, now we have a dialogue going and even if I add
netdev to the CC: now, you can't follow it completely as a netdev
subscriber without going to the lkml archives.
To answer the question, yes it is just a normal PCI device, they put 4
HME chips behind a PCI bridge.  However, the OpenFirmware on the cards
usually creates device node properties for these PCI devices for the
local ethernet addresses.  That's what he's trying to duplicate here.
