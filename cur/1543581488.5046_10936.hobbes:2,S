I missed this thread a bit but I also am experiencing problems when
using sound (playing mp3's) -- hard crashes. I am not sure wether it's X
related (xmms/X v4.0x), sound related (opensound drivers), hardware
related (dual BP6, non OC with apic patches).
could you mail privately what the issues are ? maybe I have the same
problems.
