Thanks for testing.
Yes, the SX4, unlike the TX2/TX4, does not directly give me access to 
the SATA ports, so I cannot test directly for device presence.  Instead 
I let the normal error handling routines notice the behavior.  I need to 
fix that up, but for now that's an annoying but harmless message.
