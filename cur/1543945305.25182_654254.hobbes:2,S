Yes, I see this often myself.  It's like the disk IO queue (I set mine
to 1024) fills up, and pdflush and friends can stuff write requests into
it much more quickly than any other programs can provide read requests.
CFQ and ionice work very well up until iostat shows average IO queuing
above 1024 (where I set the queue number).
