So let me try to rephrase...
- phy_change() is the workqueue callback function.  It is executed by
  keventd.
- Something under phy_change() takes rtnl_lock() (but what??)
- phy_stop_interrupts() does flush_scheduled_work().  This has to
  following logic:
  - if I am kevetnd, run phy_change() directly.
  - If I am not keventd, wait for keventd() to run phy_change()
- So if the caller of phy_stop_interrupt() already holds rtnl_lock(),
  and if that caller is keventd then it will recur onto rntl_lock() and
  will deadlock.
Problem is, if the caller of phy_stop_interrupt() is *not* keventd, that
caller will still deadlock, because that caller is waiting for keventd to
run phy_change(), and keventd cannot do that, because the not-keventd
process already holds rtnl_lock.
Now, afaict, there are only two callers of phy_stop_interrupts(): the
close() handlers of gianfar.c and fs_enet-main.c (confusingly held in
netdevice.stop (confusingly called by dev_close())).  Via phy_disconnect. 
Did I miss anything?
And the dev_close() caller holds rtnl_lock.
Summary:
a) Please tell us what code under phy_change() wants to take rtnl_lock
b) I think it should deadlock whether or not the caller of
   phy_stop_interrupt() is keventd.  What am I missing?
