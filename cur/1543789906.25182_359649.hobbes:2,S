No I don't think so.  CONFIG_RTC_HISTOGRAM is a hack, designed to work
with a specific test program that runs SCHED_FIFO and poll()s on the
RTC.  VLC apparently poll()s on the RTC but does not run SCHED_FIFO.  So
of course there will be delays.
Now that the kernel has good soft realtime support and non-root RT
scheduling, these apps really need to adopt a correct soft RT design
like JACK.  AFAICT they don't even bother to try to get SCHED_FIFO for
the time-sensitive rendering threads.  I can't even get totem-xine (the
default "Sound and Movie Player" for Gnome) to keep the audio and video
in sync.  mplayer only plays smoothly if I run it at nice -10.  Etc.
The Linux kernel is pretty good for RT these days but compared to OSX or
even Windows the apps are a joke.
