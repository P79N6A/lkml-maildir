I like them a lot too.
Without the changelogs Linus is just a "black box"
which outputs random patches.
With a good changelog, we all have a much better idea
what Linus wants and, consequently, what kind of patches
we should give him (and which kind of patches we should
wait with for a week or so).
Also, the changelog items are a good way to keep track
of what's happening with the kernel, it makes it so much
faster to track down exactly when a bug was fixed or
introduced and what change had this effect.
regards,
Rik
