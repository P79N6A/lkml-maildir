Nice URL. It made my night. Is funny.
It definitely looks like someone needs a clean start. Leave the pride 
back and start all over. After all, if one stops or starts to help in 
Linux, nobody cares.
Jeff,
    I'm not aware of your "issues" or "rights", but it really looks like 
you should drop whatever you have in hands. It's not worth to battle.
.....
    The topic of this email is missleading, the "hacking" done in the 
Linux Kernel, is not the "hacking" that is punishable with prison.
    I hope this topic drops. Sorry for mentioning about it. I had no 
idea on what this was about cause I have only been reading LKML for a year.
.Alejandro
