Hi again,
  I am seeing some odd behavior with O_DIRECT.  If a file opened with O_DIRECT has a page mmap'd,
and the file is extended via pwrite, then the mmap'd region seems to get lost - i.e. it neither
takes up system memory, nor does it get written out.
The attached file demonstrates this.
Compile with -DABUSE to trigger the bad case.
This behavior does not happen with an ext3 partition.
ethereal shows the behavior to be a large amount of block reads, with single byte writes every so
often.  Viewing the resultant file from other hosts or even the original host shows the file is
grown, but is zero-filled, not 'a'-filled.
-Kenny
