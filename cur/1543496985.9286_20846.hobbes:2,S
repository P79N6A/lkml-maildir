Well, if you have two notebooks on the table, both 1Mbit capable, it
is kind of bad when you are not able to transfer at full speed. (Yes,
this happened to me. We actually had 10mbit coax cards, but cable was
broken and it was _really_ dodgy "yes, now it pings, please hold cable
like this before transfer finishes").

On short cable, for notebook-to-notebook data transfer, it seems very
practical to me. [serial cables are much more common than 10mbit
pcmcia cards.]

Is there some easy way for me to make it work 'just now'? Like calling
tty_flip_buffer_push from some kind of bh or increasing hz to 1000 or
...? Why is size of struct tty limited to PAGE_SIZE in the first
place?
