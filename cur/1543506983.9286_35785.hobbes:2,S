most of the stuff in include/asm/mman.h is the same for all platforms, i
believe, so i was following precedent there.
according to man pages from other OSes like Solaris and HP/UX, sys/mman.h
is where applications are supposed to get those macros, and
include/asm/mman.h is the place to put things that are in the sys/mman.h
user level header.
could be wrong about that, though.
