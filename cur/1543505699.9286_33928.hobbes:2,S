I've extensive experience with MPEG 1/VideoCD/CDI decoding on the old
C-Cube CL4x0 chipset which was used by a number of vendors in the
old days.  (In fact, I have a linux driver for it) I'm also a little
familiar with the Ziva chip, also by C-Cube, used in the Creative Labs
DXR2 (perhaps a V in there someplace) DVD card.
I am not familiar with the chip used in the Hollywood products from
Sigma Designs, but I have spoken to both them and C-Cube about their
DVD products.
C-Cube was only willing to provide any information if paid US$15,000
for a developers kit.  I've since become a registered Creative Labs
developer, perhaps they might provide an answer.  Lastly, Sigma
Designs was unclear on if they would tell me anything.  But I believe
they might.
I have come accross some interesting info:
One Tidbit:  Some unknown third party company is going to release 
             linux code to drive the XXX chip.
Other Tidbit: The next generation of the XXX chip is going to have
              an integrated core of the Sigma Designs DVD decoder chip.
I believe there is a project someplace which has support for the
Creative Labs Dxr2 DVD card except for the DVD/Ziva specific portion.
