Previously, that machine was running 2.4.17-pre8. It was running fine with
smbfs, but had never been asked to touch the NT server I mentioned. OTOH,
with the 2.4.18-rc4 kernel, I can touch other Win2K (workstation) machines
with no harmful effects.
I would like to avoid going back to 2.4.18-rc2 (lack of time to compile), if
someone with identical oopes had the time the better. But if no-one does
before tomorrow, I'll try that version.
