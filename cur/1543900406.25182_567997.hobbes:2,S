Ok, that doesn't sound bad. Is the "note" something global for the whole 
thing, or are there per-object file notes that you can parse (ie can you 
figure out which modules are linked in some way?)
If it's basically just a set of hashes, I won't worry.

Yah. Not that we generally do perfectly here, but that's the kind of thing 
I'd prefer.

Is there any reason for it to be readable by anybody but the sysadmin? 
It's not like you're likely to do things like kernel debugging without 
root privileges?
So if the *common* thing is that normally people have root who really 
care, and the distro could (if it wants to) just chmod the /sysfs file 
appropriately, maybe that would allow the best of both worlds? Just 
default to it being root-readable, but let the distro override it at 
boot-time?
