I've always preferred a system where one simply lists dependencies [as 
you describe above], and some program actually does the hard work of 
chasing down all the initcall dependency checking and ordering.
Linus has traditionally poo-pooed this so I haven't put any work towards 
it... but I still think it's a good idea, and something we will 
eventually need as our system grows more complex.  If someone stood up 
and did the work, it should be pretty easy to generate a human-readable 
list of dependencies so we can check the ordering and make sure it's 
getting things right.
I wonder if there is some nifty ld feature I'm missing, that could do 
this for us...
