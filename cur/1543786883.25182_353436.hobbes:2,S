Okay, can we do simple solution where we put 460 there, plus a check
if it overflows (printk, abort suspend), for now? That should fix
768MB machine...

No, they probably will not be consecutive.
OTOH pagedirs are stored as a link list in memory already. Maybe we
should be able to extend that link list for a disk, too, with minimal
fuss? ...we'd have to write pagedir _backwards_ for that to work,
probably not nice, and swap_free() would really like direct access.
