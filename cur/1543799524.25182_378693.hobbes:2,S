I think we need to have the ability to modify things on both levels. There 
needs to be a way to introduce f.e. a general HBO type locking algorithm 
for all architectures. But then also a way for an arch to do special
things that are strongly depending on a particular arch like relocating
the actual storage location of a lock to a specially handled memory area.

The mutex implementation here is one implementation. There needs to be
a generic way to replace this implementation with another in an arch
independent way as well as the ability for an arch to modify low level
elements necessary to optimize locks on a particular hardware.
Then there is the common ground of low level mutexes with spinlocks. So 
far spinlocks also work for semaphores. Now with the MUTEXes we have two 
different locking mechanism that largely overlap in in functionality. In 
the past one could simply replace the spinlock implementation, now one 
also has to worry about MUTEXes.
I wish we had some strategy to make all of this easier and gather common 
elements together.
