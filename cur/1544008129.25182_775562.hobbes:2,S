My guess is that the mm is probably ok here, but we'll need some work on
the vfs structures, at least eventually.
The mm is nice that it has ->count separated from ->users.  We can
easily compare the sum of mm->users to the number of tasks we've frozen
since mm->users has nice defined behavior.
But, we've got suckers like proc_fd_info() that do a
get/put_files_struct().  So, somebody just doing lots of looks in /proc
could stop us from ever checkpointing.  Unfortunately, I know of a
number of "monitoring" programs that do just that. :)
I guess we can use the plain counts for now, and add something like
mm->users for the vfs structures in a bit.
