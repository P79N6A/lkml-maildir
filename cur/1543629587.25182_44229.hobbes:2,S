I have the start of a libc, based on your original "libc" in your
original initramfs patches, merged with some of my initial klibc 0.1
work <kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/klibc/> which was based
off of dietLibc.
It's available at 
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net:8080/klibc
 if people want
to poke around with it.  I'll dust it off this week, and post a clean
tarball, as it's been on hold.
Actually, in looking at that archive, it doesn't seem to have the latest
stuff checked in...I'll go find it in the morning...
I too am interested in how the makefiles and build process will work :)
thanks,
greg k-h
