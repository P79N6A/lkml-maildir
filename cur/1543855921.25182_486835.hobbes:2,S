You're right. That's not the issue.

Ah! I get it now. I had taken neither preemption nor the SMP scenario
into account before concluding that the warning might be a false
positive.
All I need to do is to run my test cases on a preemptible kernel 
or in parallel on a smp box. It'll definitely deadlock there!

Thanks for making it clear :-)
