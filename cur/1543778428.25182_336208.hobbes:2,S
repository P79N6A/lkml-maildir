If the program and test data is not proprietary, would it help to have 
me run the test on my P4P800, P4-2.8, HT on, and see if that's an issue 
with your particular board or BIOS? I have the 1086 BIOS from my notes 
on that machine, I think you were running a later BIOS? 1091 or so, from 
memory?
Anyway, I would run a test that takes 3 minutes if it helps as a data point.
