Eric I appreciate the work you've done for ck5, but this is two discrete 
problems. 
The first is the one you describe with the memory killing the scheduler - a 
serious bug. 
The second is that the interactivity patch is too slow. It takes up to 5 
seconds for xmms skipping (the reference bad program but used everywhere) to 
stop. When you first start music it skips all over the place and then settles 
down after a while. This is embarassing considering the machines are >1Ghz 
cpus and it doesnt happen on p233 with old scheduler. It appears to take less 
time the higher the Hz is (makes sense I guess) however higher Hz in 2.4 
incurs too much overhead under heavy load. This happens even in 2.5 but is a 
bit more subtle. 
My concern is that ck6pre without the interactivity addon works better. I've 
added the more finegrained scheduler timing and the small bugfix but backed 
out the rest. I don't think the interactivity patch in it's current form is 
of any use to O(1) 2.4 kernels.
I think Zwane and others have demonstrated that this happens in 2.5 as well so 
it needs some work yet to be better than stock.
