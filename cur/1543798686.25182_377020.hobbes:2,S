But the problem is even sending/receiving a single packet can cause 
multiple dynamic allocations in the networking path all the way from
the sockets layer->transport->ip->driver.
To successfully send a packet, we may have to do arp, send acks and 
create cached routes etc. So my patch tried to identify the allocations
that are needed to succesfully send/receive packets over a pre-established
socket and adds a new flag GFP_CRITICAL to those calls.
This doesn't make any difference when we are not in emergency. But when
we go into emergency, VM will try to satisfy these allocations from a
critical pool if the normal path leads to failure.
We go into emergency when some management app detects that a swap device
is about to fail(we are not yet in OOM, but will enter OOM soon). In order
to avoid entering OOM, we need to send a message over a critical socket to
a remote server that can initiate failover and switch to a different swap
device. The switchover will happen within 2 minutes after it is initiated.
In a cluster environment, the remote server also sends a message to other
nodes which are also running the management app so that they also enter
emergency. Once we successfully switch to a different swap device, the remote
server sends a message to all the nodes and they come out of emergency.
During the period of emergency, all other communications can block. But
guranteeing the successful delivery of the critical messages will help 
in making sure that we do not enter OOM situation.
