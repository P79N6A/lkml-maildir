No, I don't want to get into the distro business.  Already do enough of
that work at my day job :)

LXR doesn't look to run without a web server backend, which makes this
very limited.  I'm trying to get jsFind working properly, and then index

basic search engine, but without cross references.
Unless someone knows how to do this another way?
