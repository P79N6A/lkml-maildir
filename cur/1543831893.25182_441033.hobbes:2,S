Hmm.  at 10,000 IRQs and 128 cpus I got about 5MB.  But close enough.
I'm convinced at least for now.
The case I have seen are sparsely populated irqs.
And we really do need the high IRQ counts because the potential irqs
really do go up at 15 or so IRQs per cpu.
Still if we are doing this generically let's please put in a
big fat comment describing the situation, and maybe a compile warning,
if things get too big.
