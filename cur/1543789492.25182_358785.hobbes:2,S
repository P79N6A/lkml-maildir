I agree, it's tough, nasty, and full of horrible issues like this.  I
got away with much the same mess with the USB core code where we mix
devices of different types on the same bus, but I wouldn't recommend
ever doing that again.
So, when we move everything over to being only devices, I'll try to make
problems like this impossible to occur, as it's a pain...
