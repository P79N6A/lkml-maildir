Interesting, although I don't believe I have a hardware fault. The box is perfectly stable under
2.6.18.x. Anyway, my particular problem happened very quickly last time so I am hoping that
recompiling xine from scratch will trigger something again. This time, however, I have built a
2.6.19.x kernel with a few memory debugging options turned on.
Cheers,
Chris
