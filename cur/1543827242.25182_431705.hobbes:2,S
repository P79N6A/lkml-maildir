Ah, thanks for pointing this out.  Those files should go to debugfs,
they do NOT belong in sysfs at all.

No, you don't need a major to create a new class in sysfs at all.  Look
at usb_host for an example of that :)
And even if you did, we have loads of free major numbers now, it's not a
big deal to get a new one.
I vote for this, it would make things much easier.

Ok, I also read the 0/5 in this series which describes this in detail,
sorry for not seeing that (hint, cc: everyone on the series that one
too, so they get a bit of detail in the future.)
