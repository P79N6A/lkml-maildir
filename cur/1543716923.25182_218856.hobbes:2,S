Hi Neil (and others),
is there any reason why current 2.4 kernels do not allow for
NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE to become as large as 32k?
The problem is when I use NFSv3/TCP with a 2.4.25, say, on the server
side, as well as on the client side, I am experiencing lockups when
copying medium-sized or large files from the NFS fs to a local fs.
But, after applying the following trivial patch, everything is well again:

 #ifdef __KERNEL__
32k is the maximum block size allowed by the NFS3 standard, as far as I
understand.
I realize that, before 2.4.19, this patch was part of the NFSv3/TCP server
patches, before this functionality got into the vanilla kernel. But with
the merge, this patch got lost! Is there any reason?
Best regards
Oliver
