If early userspace isn't ready, it sounds like a choice between 
"nothing" and "it works".
We want a clean, tasteful solution, sure.  But I think we can work 
within the confines of the existing 2.6 API, and not postpone this stuff 
under early userspace is ready.

Overall... the storage industry finally got off their ass and created a 
vendor-neutral RAID format, and they're actually using it.  Linux users 
don't deserve to be left out in the cold until 2.7.x klibc stuff is in, 
since they will be buying such RAID hardware right now.
I got into the Linux kernel game years ago in a large part because of 
precisely this -- getting Linux users going on hardware that would 
otherwise be Windows-only, without my help.  (or would otherwise be a 
grotty and buggy vendor driver, without my help:))
