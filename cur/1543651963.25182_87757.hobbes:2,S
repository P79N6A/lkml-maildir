I have to do a new compile with the csets from overnight for the htree
bug before I can test that.  But from /var/log I see:
    kernel: input: PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
with the patch and w/o the patch I had:
    kernel: input: PS/2 Generic Mouse on isa0060/serio1
so that part of it at least was fixed.
