    I was supposing something in that line, since disk speed is quite
high (when I only read or write but not both). I just didn't think about
PCI bandwidth.

    Won't that reduce disk performance when using just one disk? I don't
pass much data between disks (or even copy data within one disk), so not
being able to watch movies while copying data is, for me, more
acceptable than having a slower disk all the time.
    And yes, all my disks are UDMA100.
    Is there a way of changing chipset behaviour from userspace so PCI
bus is not filled during IO bursts?
    Thanks a lot for your answer, Alan :)
