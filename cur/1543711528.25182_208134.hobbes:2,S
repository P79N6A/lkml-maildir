I may have been wrong about that sorry, it's still not certain though,
but I had a bug in the code that would mistake a sigbus for a page_t
outside the mem_map, so it could have been a sigbus not a non-ram page.
Also in the meantime I noticed with NUMA it's impossible to handle
non-ram correctly in ->nopage, at least if using the current
page_to_pfn.

I agree, I reistantiated the debug check because we cannot handle
non-ram from there if it's numa (actually discontigmem). If alsa uses
non-ram pages it must be fixed, but I've an hope it was a sigbus
trouble. We'll know more in a few more hours.
(btw, Martin definitely triggered the sigbus with numa, the 0x3()
dereference was a the page_t address to read page->flags >> 24)
it's good to have reminded the API cannot handle non-ram.
