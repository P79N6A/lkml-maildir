   I still see no point in putting this into kernel space.
   As a proof of concept - if someone wants to try - one can implement 
this system on top of any other fs. in user space.
   open("/aaa.txt") ->
     inode ->
      underlaying_fs.open(itoa(inode)+".meta")
      underlaying_fs.open(itoa(inode)+".data")
   write(fd) -> fd<->inode -> updateindex(inode) + write(inode). [1]
   and so on and so forth. LD_PRELOAD=libcoolfs.so my_cool_app
   in other words file system can be used as smart storage.
   hard links can be 'mis'used to implement search indeces.
[1]  mmap() is the notable problem.
