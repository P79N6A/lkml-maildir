Good pointers, thanks a lot!
I guess I cumulate the causes for errors: I run 2 rc5des clients, I have
a Matrox video card, no cooling on my BX chipset, although I have 2 fans
(1 at the bottom sucking air in, one under the power supply to extract
hot air outside).
And yes, I run VMWare constantly, but lockup have happened without it.
: I downloaded the newest BIOS QQ-2 (all my problems vanished)

Why do you call it QQ-2? The file I downloaded is "bp6nj.exe"...
