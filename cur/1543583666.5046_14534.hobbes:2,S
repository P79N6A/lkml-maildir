Following up.., I scripted an nmap run, it is in html ;)
http://stuph.org/tcp-window-shrinkers.nmap.html
Format is:
   IP
   dns lookup
   nmap results
   [OS type]                      [Identified]
The script is running now, DNS is tacked in which makes the cycle take 
longer but helps to identify probable dynamic dialups.
Please use Mozilla or IE.  The output is usable in Netscape 4.x but suffers.
