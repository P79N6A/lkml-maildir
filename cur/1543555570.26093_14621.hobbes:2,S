It is wrong.  copy_*_user handle the page faults, whether they are good
faults (swapped out, copy on write) or bad faults (illegal access).
Without these macros you get the "unable to handle kernel page fault"
oops message if a fault occurs.

The address is valid, the pages probably aren't.  In fact, extending the
address space only creates read-only mappings to the global zeroed page
if I remember right.

You can't even use copy_*_user in this context (since the current user
space might be any process, even kernel threads that have no user space
at all).
For access to user memory from interrupt context at all and to access
user memory without the uaccess macros, you have to lock them down in
memory, with map_user_kiobuf().  This is only recommended if you want
hardware to DMA to/from buffers provided by user space.

It will fail quickly, probably taking the kernel down with it.
The most elegant way to share memory between user and kernel is to
allocate the memory in the kernel and map it to user space (by
implementing mmap  on the kernel side for the file used for
communication).
