Yes, there are lots of stylistic and API-usage issues with the driver and
it needs someone to fix them all up.  Unfortunately the original
developer's English is very poor and he's obviously quite unfamiliar with
how Linux development happens.
This is all resolveable - it just needs someone to get down and work with
Erich on knocking the driver into shape.  But as yet, nobody has stepped up
to do that work.
And yes, the driver does apparently work.
