If silicon isn't available yet, let's just remove those PCI IDs.  That
way we can ensure that these are libata only, without two drivers
sharing the same PCI ids.

They can, but consider a system that uses 2.6.7 (IDE driver) then boots
into 2.6.8 (libata driver):  the drives move from /dev/hdX to /dev/sdX.
That breaks stuff not using LABEL= in bootloader config and fstab.
