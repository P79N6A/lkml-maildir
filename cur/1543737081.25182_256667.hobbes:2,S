OK, maybe I was not clear enough in the first post.
Fsck seemed to run during the reboot
after a reset button was hit to recover from a hard hung.
However, NO OUTPUT message from fsck is shown on the console.
It progressed silently : I could hear the disk access
(head movement) and this made me very uncomfortable.
With a test kernel accessing disk furiously without
telling me what it does during otherwise smooth booting
process after a hard reset, I may need to consider
the chance of kernel running wild and trashing the file system.
So that is why I rebooted the system using 2.4.xx which I have
used for quite a long time to make sure that the file system(s)
are fsck'ed and then cleanly remounted.
Anyway, before contacting the Debian package maintainer, I found
the following.
IF during the booting the environment variable TERM
is set to "dumb", "network", "unknown" or not set at all
the progressive horizontal bar display (-C option to fsck)
is disabled in the Debian startup script.
Maybe the TERM setup for console during booting has changed between
kernel 2.4.2x and 2.6.9-rc2?
A little more detail:
I checked the Debian startup script myself.
Now I notice that if the fsck is invoked in a startup script and $TERM is
set to "dumb" or "network" or "unknown" or not set at all, this
progress bar display (-C option to fsck)
is not done by the Debian start up script.
Maybe between 2.4.2x and 2.6.9-rc2,
the boot console $TERM setting changed?

I think I saw Activating Swap message.  But I am not sure if I saw
"Checking root file system..." message during a reboot after the RESET
button was hit due to a hung.  I was not paying attention to that.
But definitely, I didn't see at all the
growing ASCII character-base horizontal bar with a spinning char on
the right (/ - \ |).  This is a way to show progress bar. This is
shown with the -C option to fsck. I usually see this progressive
bar for fsck during reboot under 2.4.2x kernel.
So obviously "-C" is reset to "". I am NOT using s390 :-)
(OR the output from this shell is eaten by some other mechanism.
  I need to understand the stdio/stdout setting of the shell
  invoking this script further.)
I will check with the maintainer of Debian package further.
