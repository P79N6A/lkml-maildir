Hi,
I wrote that I observed that Linux 2.2.2-ac7 TCP connection setups
ignored ICMP Host Unreachable packets.  And that Linux 2.0.36 honoured
the ICMP Host Unreachables by returning immediately with an error
(EHOSTUNREACH from connect() ).
The truth is a bit more complicated: 2.2.2-ac7 *does* honour ICMP HU's from
some machines and *ignores* them from other machines.  This in itself
is interesting.  Even more complicated: 2.2.2-ac7 *sometimes* honours
ICMP HU's from a machine that it normaly ignores.
Disclaimer: I didn't do any extensive testing with other machines or
            kernels than the ones below.  But I found reproduceable
            test-cases.
Linux 2.0.36 has the "correct & preferred" behaviour IMO.
Claims were made that according the RFCs ICMP Host Unreachable should
be ignored and that 2.2.x does this correctly.  I think that honouring
ICMP HU's during TCP's *connection setup* is NOT violating RFC-1122:
It can be interpreted that ICMP HU's should only be ignored for
*established* TCP connections.  I didn't look yet for explicit
indications that ICMP HU's should be honoured during connection setup.
Anyway, I've collected some data for people interested.
Note that "Case 2" is the "strange" one.  The other ones appear OK to me.
Andi Kleen asked about IcmpInErrors (/proc/net/snmp) and OutOfWindowIcmps
(/proc/net/netstat) behaviour.  One could indeed think about corrupted
ICMP packets to explain the behaviour.  But both IcmpInErrors and
OutOfWindowIcmps (on 2.2.2-ac7) did NOT change during any of the Cases
below.

Remark 1: the 130.161.38.136 address is not used at the moment on our
          network.  To make the router send the ICMP Host Unreachable
          you'll sometimes have to wait a little bit the first time
          because it needs to give up on ARPing 130.161.38.136 first !
Remark 2: I guess these *.eri.net guys are ISP with dial-up links.
          Sometimes you have to try some IP numbers in their range
          (207.90.112.* ?) to find an unused one which makes the
          router generate the ICMP Host Unreachable.  If it's in use
          you'll probably get a RST packet which results in the
          completely different "Connection refused" !
          I don't now *.eri.net other than from severe port-scanning
          activities to a friends machine.  Investigating the probing
          machine / IP-number made me notice the "strange" different
          Linux 2.2.2 behavour !
Remark 3: The only apparent difference between the ICMP packets in
          Case 1/3 and 2/4 as seen with tcpdump is that 1/3 has the
          TOS bits set to 0xd0.  Haven't checked the code but I doubt
          that that would explain the difference.
Remark 4: The <wait for time-out> can be interrupted when an unused
          dial-up IP-number becomes used during the waiting and a
          sent SYN results results in a RST packet !
