absolutely, I believed that the driver was *exactly*
the same as the previous release which didn't boot and
needed the fix, but another fix has been applied and
corrected it. Now I think it will work with a clean
2.2.18pre25. Anyway, I left a kernel compile behind me
this evening, so I'll confirm this on monday as soon
as
I can reboot the server on a pre25.
Cheers,
Willy
