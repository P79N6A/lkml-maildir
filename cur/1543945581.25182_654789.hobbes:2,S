this is pure bad since GCC already assumes that NULL checks are unlikely,
and with the unlikely() code needing to normalize stuff... it will generate 
worse code for sure yes.

no argument.. how about we start with all the cases where the author just got it 
entirely wrong ... like the ones from this patch ;)
