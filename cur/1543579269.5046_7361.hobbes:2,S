Nonstop..  argh.
I now believe that it is indeed caused by booting to windows 98
(by accident).  ;o)
Doesn't matter if a driver is installed in win or not as I've
tried both.  Just booting win at all causes the card to go
berzerk next boot.  Must be something missing from the card init
code that should be resetting something on the card at init time,
but which is set by default on power on.
Very irritating.  Problem doesn't manifest itself until you
actually use the ethernet card for something.  Then you have to
log out of 17 vc's and 10 bugzilla windows in mozilla to reboot.
Disconcerting. ;o)

If it weren't for C, we'd all be programming in BASI and OBOL.
