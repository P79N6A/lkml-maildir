   Just recently installed a dlink dge550t in P3 Asus CUV4X-E. Still has
vortex board installed, but not connected to LAN. Connected to 10/100
switch still.
   After switching to 2.4.13-ac4, short time after boot start getting
transmit timeout. No log, because that goes to another system on LAN.
Will reproduce if exact message is desired.
   Rebooted 2.4.13-ac4. Got timeout again shortly after.
   Rebooted back to 2.4.12-ac3. No problems for rest of day. Running
RML's preempt patch on both kernels: that's the only difference from ac
(except for nVidia driver module).
   Willing to get better information if this is worth pursuing.
