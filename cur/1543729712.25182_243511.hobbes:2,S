Works fine for me with 2.6.8.1 and the Fedora Core2 2.6.7-based kernel.
If you physically turn off the server as opposed to just killing the
nfsd processes, then it takes a bit longer than for the networking layer
to time out the sock_release etc (isn't that under the control of the
tcp_fin_timeout sysctl?), but AFAICS it does eventually get there.
Are there any other details you're omitting?
Cheers,
