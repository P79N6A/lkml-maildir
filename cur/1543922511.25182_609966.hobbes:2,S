Been there, done that ;-)

Yep, -rt2 (and -rt3) are both horrible too. That's why I'm working on a
sched-domain version now to handle that.

Well, we need a balance between cacheline hits, and where to pull from.
As performance goes, the two are inverse perportional. The secret is to
find a nice middle ground.

It's only linear in respect to the size of the domain or cpus allowed. Any
8/16 way boxes worried about cacheline bouncing need to reign in on the
cpus allowed mask. Otherwise, we would simply have bouncing anyway with
the tasks themselves.
