I have tried the noapic option for the kernel without any result. However
I reloaded RHL 6.2 on the m/c, and it is working properly. By the way what
other options do I need to probe?

That is surprising as the m/c is working perfectly under RHL 6.2 which is
an older release, assuming that what works perfectly for an earlier
release should work for the later release.
Still waiting for a solution.
