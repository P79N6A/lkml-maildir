I dont think so. The system is very simple. On the 50 pin Fast scsi there is the
CD.
And on the Ultra2 device the IBM harddrive.  On the cable there is a terminator.
(This is the cable from ASUS delivered with the motherboard. Is a balanced pair
cable.) On the
harddrive there is a strap for termination and in the BIOS there is a swich
for ternination. The strip is off. (I have tryed on also) And the BIOS controlled
termination is ON. I have tryed all permutations! But I have found a workaround.
The wide scsi was not in use and have the same connector so  I moved the
harddriv to that bus and now everything works with 2.4.3. Or at least
for a half an hour...  But the drive is a LVD and should be on the Ultra2
connector.
