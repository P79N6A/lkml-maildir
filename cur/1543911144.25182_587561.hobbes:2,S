Subject: [PATCH] x86_64 mce{_amd}: Fix section mismatch warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/22/545

* mce.c:
mce_create_device() is marked __cpuinit and hence goes into .init.text
when HOTPLUG_CPU=n. However, the hotplug notifier callback function
mce_cpu_callback() is not marked __cpuinit therefore goes into .text
section unconditionally. This causes reference to .init.text from .text
which would cause modpost to warn (bogusly, because a CPU hotplug event
can never happen anyway if HOTPLUG_CPU=n). Anyway, let's fix this by
marking callback as __cpuinit and the notifier_block as __cpuinitdata.
Having done that, mce_remove_device() is only ever called from __cpuinit
marked functions so can be marked __cpuinit itself.
* mce_amd.c:
Has an exactly similar section mismatch as that discussed in previous
case. Solve it similarly by marking notifier callback as __cpuinit and
notifier_block as __cpuinitdata. This causes a viral effect and allows
us to mark a bunch of other functions as __cpuinit also.

[ I don't have x86_64 toolchain, but it's still obvious enough to me
  that the existing code would cause said section mismatch warnings. ]
