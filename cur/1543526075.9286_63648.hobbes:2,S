I haven't been following this thread closely, nor do I know the floppy
low-level hardware, but I had a question (under the heading of "food for
thought"):  Is it possible (for the floppy case) for Linux to keep the
LED on during the time it is unsafe to eject the disk?  (LED is on while
mounted, turned off when unmounted?)  If the hardware doesn't give you
that control, then obviously you can toss this suggestion. :)
Just rely on the user's programming. ;)
