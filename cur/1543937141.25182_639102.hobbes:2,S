I guess your box has high resolution timers and/or dynamic ticks
enabled. In that case we really can not switch to jiffies. We also
have to prevent PIT from being selected. 
I have a patch pending for the PIT issue. Will add jiffies to this as
well.
We'll fix that in .25 as it requires root user interaction and does
not show up magically.
Thanks,
