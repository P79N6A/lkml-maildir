i do read those docs, religiously.  but things that didn't work in the
past, i don't necessarily try again with every revision of kernel/ip tool
8)
speaking of docs, give me more and more please.  i have some problems i
need solved.
200.0.0.x netA
                          \_____________ linux ip router -> internal lan.
                          /
100.0.0.x netB
i need the linux ip router box to send packets for netA to netA with a
source address in netA, and for netB to netB from netB.
and i just discovered the importance of flushing routes, please make that
a BOLD item in several places throughout the documentation.
also, is there a way to flush rule tables?  not singular, but the entire
thing save the local/main/253?
thankyou,
-d
