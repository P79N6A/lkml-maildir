The first time you make oldconfig kbuild 2.5 asks if you want to
install System.map and .config, separate questions.  If you say y then
it asks where you want to install the files, with a default of
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/.  Once set, the values propagate to subsequent
builds that use the same .config.
