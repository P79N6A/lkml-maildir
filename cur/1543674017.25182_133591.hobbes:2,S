Right.  The only drawback is that we have another level of indirection for
some operations, but its negligible because it'll only be used on swap
operations or core dumps, both of which rely on disk access times anyway.
I guess a refcount and a key can be added to vm_area_struct, to provide
that.  As long as this vma is in use, key remains valid.
There's still something I'm unsure of.  I'm not familiar with the mm
subsystem.  Do you know whether vma structs are shared among processes
with shared mapping ?  I'd think the answer is yes, in which case the
above is the right way, but if it works that way, how come vm_area_struct
doesn't have a refcount yet ?  Who keeps track of it ?  Who frees it when
the last mapper unmaps it ?  Is the vma->shared in charge of all that ?
If so, what lock protects it ?

Yes, I seems so, but we need to dig into mm and find some answers to be
sure about all cases.

It does, unless I'm also off the cuckoo train at this hour.  Time to get
some sleep, I guess :)
