My sister has a Compaq Presario 2200 which has a Cyrix MediaGX
CPU (P-180 equiv).  I did a search through the sound drivers and
cannot find support for this chip.  I am not sure whether the
sound is built in to the MediaGX chip or is just part of the
motherboard... the BIOS lists it as Xpress Audio.  Note that
this chip has the video card built in to the CPU.
Does the Linux kernel support sound on this chip?  If so, which
option do I enable?
