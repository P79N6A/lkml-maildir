Alan I don't want to be right at all costs, I have really no one problem
to admit when I am wrong. I am an human and as an human it's normal I am
wrong sometime.

I quoted the same email as well. The above one is the only patch I pointed
out about zmagic stuff in my email.
Now have a look at my ftp area:

./patches/v2.2/2.2.13pre14/zmagic-only-fix.bz2

The above one is the _only_ patch I proposed you for inclusion into
2.2.13. I am been very paranoid in what I sent you to merge and I wanted
only obviously right stuff in it. That's the reason I generated the
zmagic-only-fix in first place.
I am also sure I only proposed you only the zmagic-only-fix, because I
developed the zmagic-5.gz on 16 October and the email was of 10 October:
andrea@alpha:~ > ls -l kernel/v2.2/2.2.13pre17/zmagic-5.gz 
-rw-r--r--   1 andrea   andrea       1419 Oct 16 17:11 kernel/v2.2/2.2.13pre17/zmagic-5.gz
If you have a mirror you can get the confirm of when I uploaded zmagic-5
from the emails you get from the mirror daemon.
If you see something not matching between my email and the ftp area, don't
worry to cross-check with me via email and I'll always give you an answer
ASAP.
Andrea
