I couldn't find a far jump that took a 64-bit address to jump to. But
I guess that the kernel will be loaded in the lowest 4G regardless so
I guess 32-bit pointers are ok, right? That will make it simpler for
sure.
What do you think about reloading CS? Is it the right thing to do, or
is it correct as it is today where we depend on that CS == _KERNEL_CS?
I need to fix kexec-tools regardless, but maybe it is a good idea to
make the 64-bit kernel boot a bit robust too.
Thanks,
