Just like smbios/dmi type 10 we add the the info to the dmi_devices list.
The dmi_find_device function (see drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c) makes this
info available to other device drivers (like drivers/ata/ata_piix.c,
drivers/misc/thinkpad_acpi.c, drivers/watchdog/ibmasr.c and
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c).
The dmi_devices list is a different list then the dmi_ident table that stores
the BIOS, PRODUCT, BOARD and CHASSIS info (and that is exported to /sys/class/dmi/* ).
The dmi_devices list is not exported to sysfs as far as I know.
My opinion: if we have type 10 we will need type 41 in the future. If we don't need
type 10 then we don't need type 41 neither (since we can use dmidecode in userspace).
Greetings,
Wim.
