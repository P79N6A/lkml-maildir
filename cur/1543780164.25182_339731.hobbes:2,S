They are supposed to be present, but not in the kernel.

If somebody is stripping whitespace in the kernel, find and destroy.

You are seeing this wrong. The problem is not binary vs. text.
If binary were the problem we'd have a generic ioctl tool that takes
arguments in any number format you'd want. The problem is untyped
data. ASCII-strings without leading or trailing whitespece is a clearly
defined datatype. Requiring a tool ensuring this format is met or care
is used if other tools are used is perfectly in order. The kernel does
not guess what an input is supposed to mean. Anything else is bloat.
