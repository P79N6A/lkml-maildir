I have seen several posts in the archives that mention the following error on 
VIA chipset (usually K7V Athlon boards):
hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2, assigned device number 7
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=7 (error=-110)
hub.c: Cannot enable port 2 of hub 1, disabling port.
hub.c: Maybe the USB cable is bad?
If anyone could shed any light on this or recommend a test to find out more I 
would be very grateful. It may or may not be related to my other USB problem.
I am seeing this error on attempting a bulk transfer to a USB camera:
usbdevfs: USBDEVFS_BULK failed dev 8 ep 0x81 len 4096 ret -110
The thing that strikes me about this is that the endpoint in question is 
specified thus:
			Endpoint Address: 81
			Direction: in
			Attribute: 2
			Type: Bulk
			Max Packet Size: 64
			Interval:   0ms
Max packet size of 64 would seem to indicate that packets of too large a size 
are being sent to the endpoint. Is this a correct analysis?
Any help with either of these problems would be much appreciated. Please CC 
any replies. Thanks.
