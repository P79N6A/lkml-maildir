Sure does. But the desired effect when it's not applications is that of 
swappiness being excruciatingly low so people end up doing that. Then they 
find themselves dropping it at nighttime and increasing it during the day.

I am in full agreement there... It's easy to see that applications do not 
swap out overnight; but i'm having difficulty trying to find a way to 
demonstrate the other part. I guess timing the "linking the kernel with full 
debug" on a low memory box is measurable.

Oh sorry, perhaps I should have said - that keeps people's current settings 
meaningful, but that can happily be broken. That would make the default 
setting something like 34 instead of 60.
