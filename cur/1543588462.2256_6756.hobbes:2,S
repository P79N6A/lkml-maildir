In almost all cases - no. The MMX instructions are mostly not useful. A few
graphics operations benefit from them such as mpeg players but that is about
it.
On the AMD and Cyrix machines 3Dnow is used extensively by Mesa (3D) and by
many of the mp3 players. The winchip and athlon kernels also use mmx for
block copies but this isnt a win in the pentium case.
