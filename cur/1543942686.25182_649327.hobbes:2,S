cross-CPU IPIs are a bit fragile on some PC platforms. So if the kexec 
code relies on getting IPIs to all other CPUs, it might not be able to 
do it reliably. There might be limitations on how many APIC irqs there 
can be queued at a time, and if those slots are used up and the CPU is 
not servicing irqs then stuff gets retried. This might even affect NMIs 
sent via APIC messages - not sure about that.
