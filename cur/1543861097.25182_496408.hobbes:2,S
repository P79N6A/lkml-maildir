I wouldn't agree with this. We have what headers are to be used in 
userspace now well defined with the "make headers_install" feature in 
the kernel, which is what Fedora Core 6 is basing its kernel headers on. 
Including all headers is simply asking for userspace to use functions, 
etc. from the kernel source which they have no business using.
