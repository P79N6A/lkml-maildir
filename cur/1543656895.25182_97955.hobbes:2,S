Actually, it's even worse, as the current probe code also turn off
address decoders of PCI<->PCI bridges when probing, and in a lot of
case, the combo ASIC containing the interrupt controller _is_ behind a
PCI<->PCI bridge ! Same problem with serial port (so printk is unsafe
for quite a while on serial consoles) etc...
The code has a comment that clearly says that we don't know why address
decoding is turned off and that should be fixed, so I suggest we either
fix it now or replace the comment with an explanation of why we need to
turn it off ;) Eventually, turning it off could be made an exception via
some quirks mecanism.
Ben.
