For any of this to be motivating to anyone here, you'll have to
present an argument as to why this can't be done in userspace. identd
isn't a terribly complex thing -- one would think that a carefully
crafted userspace daemon could saturate any reasonable network
connection.
Conversely, if it can't be done fast from userspace, then people to
hear about that. That means that there's some task the kernel needs to
be made more faster at doing.
And if whatever potential performance problems with the kernel are
fixed, then all applications, including your userspace identd too,
will benefit from the fixes.
