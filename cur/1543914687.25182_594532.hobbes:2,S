Hm, these phdrs seem OK though; I don't see any ~3Gish numbers here, so
it looks like objcopy is just going off into the weeds. 
I don't know how ARM images are built, but I would guess that something
is trying to make the file large enough to accomodate a 3Gish kernel
virtual address address which hasn't being appropriately phys-ized.  It
may be more a linker script bug than an inherent problem with either
notes or build-id themselves.

Yes, binutils can be pretty fragile with notes about.  In this case it
seems to be a specific problem with build-id; I'm not really sure what
build-id actually does.
Though if my theory above is true, it may end up properly assigning a
value to a symbol
by putting it into the right section.  Or something.

The Note section is supposed to be a general extensible way of adding
metadata to an object file, either for a linker or a loader.  There's no
inherent connection between notes and build-id (other than build-id is
one of the users of notes, I suppose).
