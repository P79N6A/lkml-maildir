Yes, but this has to be done in writing and neither the BSD nor the GPL
license claim to allow this.

Through written agreements to permit this. Neither the BSD nor the GPL
license do. You cannot revoke someone's GPL rights to code you did not
write because they flow directly from the original author to the recipient.
The GPL is quite clear, you do not grant a license to anyone else's code,
the original author does. This is why the GPL does not need to be in writing.
