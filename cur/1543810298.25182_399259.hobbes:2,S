This  POS is pretty popular among kernel janitors, so, can someone who
is successfully using it, please, post crystally clear step-by-step
instructions on how to send a foo.patch:
	inline
	with tabs preserved
	with long lines preserved
Sending plain text attachments is OK with me, but, heh, people do post
patches inline and screw themselves.
I'll put instructions somewhere on -kj website and point every
unsuspecting new guy to them.
