No, my test machine for that is a compile server, and uses the built-in 
motherboard graphics which are very limited. This is not in any sense a 
graphics powerhouse, it is used to build custom kernels and 
applications, and for testing of kvm and xen, and I grabbed it because 
it had the only Core2 CPU I could reboot to try new kernel versions and 
"from cold boot" testing, discovered the graphics smoothness issue by 
having several windows open on compiles, and developed the glitch1 
script as a way to reproduce it.
The settings I used, features=14, granularity=500000, work to improve 
smoothness on other machines for other uses, but they do seem to impact 
performance for compiles, video processing, etc, so they are not optimal 
for general use. I regard the existence of these tuning knobs as one of 
the real strengths of CFS, when you change the tuning it has a visible 
effect.
