There are only two stacks involved, the normal kernel stack and your new ndis 
stack.  You save ESP of the kernel stack at the base of the ndis stack.  When 
the Windows code calls your api, you get the ndis ESP, load the kernel ESP 
from the base of the ndis stack, push the ndis ESP so you can get back to the 
ndis code later, and continue on your merry way.

You will allocate your own stack once on driver initialization.

I missed something there.  You would switch stacks before calling the Windows 
code and after the Windows code calls you (and respective returns) so you are 
always in your own code when you switch, hence you know how to copy the 
parameters.

He suggested you use your own private variant of current which would 
presumeably read a copy of current you stored at the bottom of your own 
stack.  But I don't see why your code would ever need current while you are 
on the private ndis stack.
Andi, their stack will have to have a valid thread_info->task because 
interrupts will use it.  Out of interest, could you please explain what for?
Code like u32 stack[THREAD_SIZE/sizeof(u32)] is violated by a different sized 
stack, but apparently not in any way that matters.
By the way, I use ndis_wrapper, thanks a lot you guys!
