I don't know why it's more common, but I agree that it seems so. I have 
speculated that it may be related to 4k stack, but I can't even generate 
a credible wild-ass guess on that, much less find any evidence, so I 
doubt that's much if any correlation.
Getting memory a page at a time is ugly, but it will probably work just 
fine.
