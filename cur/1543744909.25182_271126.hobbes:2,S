I think that PF_PACKETs "bypass" the firewall. Don't count on that, though.
(It's because I still see incoming port attempts despite having a tight
-P DROP)

You "sit" on the network card chip and then think of input and output.
Btw, -j DROP will only drop what has not been matched up to now. So if you get
to -j ACCEPT IPsec traffic beforehand (I think -m ah / -m esp, did not
it?), they will never reach -j DROP.
