But that's a general argument for having hard-rt in the standard
kernel. Which one of these steps cannot, from your point of view,
be implemented in a nanokernel archiecture? ... keeping in mind
that, as Andi mentioned, the need for increased responsivness for
the mainstream kernel is relevant with or without PREEMT_RT and
that increasing responsiveness is a never-ending work-in-progress.
