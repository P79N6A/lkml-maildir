I think we're talking about the same thing :)

If dev->driver has not been set and symlink creation failed, we'll end
up with an unbound but registered device. Maybe the same should happen
if dev->driver had been set before (register the device but reset
dev->driver to NULL)?

Agreed.

I'll do a new patch series tomorrow.
