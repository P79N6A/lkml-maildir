It's simple in bk to revert a patch.  So in this instance, when the
2.6.x person pulls in the 2.6.x.y tree, they just revert the offending
patch, and move on.  Actually, the maintainer applying the offending
patch would do it, in their tree, before they sent it to Linus.  Or they
do it by the normal patch way, if they don't use bk.
So, not a problem.

If it's a bugfix for the core, that met the above rules, I wouldn't mind
it at all.  See the sysfs core patch that made it in between 2.6.11-rc5
and 2.6.11 for such an example.
