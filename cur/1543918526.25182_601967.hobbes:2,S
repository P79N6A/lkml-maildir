All that should be moved to DEBUGFS under /sys/kernel/debug  and so on
-  that's right, a bit other issue
is of interest for me.
My suggestion is that a few other problems with PROCFS exist:
From my observation there are two major issues are involved:
1.  /proc/sys entry has very specific readdir operation (vs. other
entries such as /proc/drivers and others)
    entries to /proc/sys is likely is to be performed by means of other API.
    (quick search found thet API explanation for 2.4.xx
http://www.opentech.at/papers/embedded_proc/node33.html,
     yet it looks to be a little change in 2.6)
2.  function xlate_proc_name behaves not the way it specified in it's
header comment:
      [1]  minor issue is that proc_match wolud likely return "equals"
as result of comparison of "sys" and "sysvipc"
      [2] more significant issue is that it can't properly walk long
paths  such as /proc/sys/jbd/jbd-debug,
           but only paths likes /proc/sys/jbd-debug  (just one step
down, path walking is broken).
This way we can't add not only /proc/sys/jbd/jbd-debug but any path
likes /proc/aaa/bbb/xxx-debug at one step.
The entry /proc/sys is still specific, because even if fixing
xlate_proc_name we can't see /proc/sys/jbd/jbd-debug
in userspace and successfully see /proc/aaa/bbb/jbd-debug.
That's because /proc/sys specific operator readdir blocks such PROCFS
entries that they are NOTproperly registersd
 with CTL_TABLE.
Yet I think that we have a general problem with
adding-long-paths-in-one-step, which is addressed by the following patch:
