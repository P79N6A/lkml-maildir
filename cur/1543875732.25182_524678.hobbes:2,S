JFYI the preliminary version of the hidraw interface is now in the 
hid/usbhid git tree, and has also been in a few recent -mm kernels 
already.

The crucial thing here is that all reports but the ones that the driver 
registered to will be processed in a standard way by the generic hid bus 
layer, and those reports that the driver registered to will be ignored by 
the layer, and passed for processing to the driver.

Yes, HUT is Hid Usage Table. You can obtain them from
