Hopefully it's a SCSI over USB device. If it is, there is support
already for it. However, support needs to settle down and stabilize and
hopefully, that will happen soon.
Can you give us a dump of the descriptors for the device (just load
usbcore, the HC driver and the hub driver) and we can tell you for
certain if it's supported now.
