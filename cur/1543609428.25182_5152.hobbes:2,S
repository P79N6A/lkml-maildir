Correction, the NFS rename bug I mentioned is not reiserfs specific, and 
it is fixed by Neil Brown in a patch that is reported to work by our 
users, and it is better described as  a hardlink to unexported files bug 
rather than a rename bug.  So if you apply that patch, or export entire 
filesystems only, it is reasonable to use reiserfs for home directories.
