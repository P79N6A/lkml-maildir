Mike,
The question was not "which one is better". Old "good" Joseph Stalin would
most likely say "both are better" ;)
The question was "which one to merge into IKD and possibly maintain
separately (at least in 2.2.x series but maybe integrate in 2.3.x series -
I agree with Scott there)"
Regards,
Tigran.
