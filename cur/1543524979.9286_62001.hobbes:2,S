Hello friends,
In order to allow me to spend more of my Linux time actually hacking on
Linux, Transmeta has hired Jim Pick, of kernelnotes.org fame, as the new
webmaster/admin of the Linux Kernel Archives, kernel.org.  I will still
be advising Jim, but my intent is to more or less give him free hands at
implementing whatever improvements he thinks make sense.
Hopefully this will result in many new services on kernel.org, as well
as me making more progress on projects such as Genesis and autofs v5.
Either way, please everyone go easy on Jim as he comes up to speed :)
Sincerely,
	-hpa
