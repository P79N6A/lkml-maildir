That's not a useful bug report.  "eth0" is the name given to a large
number of different ethernet drivers.  For example on my X61 laptop,
running 2.6.29-rc1, eth0 works just fine --- and it refers to the
e1000e driver.  i.e., from my boot-time dmesg:
[    1.383904] e1000e: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - 0.3.3.3-k6
[    1.384002] e1000e: Copyright (c) 1999-2008 Intel Corporation.

On my Lenovo S10 netbook, eth0 refers to the Broadcom Tigon3 (tg3)
driver.  From my boot-time dmesg: (this happens to be a 2.6.28 kernel
since I was testing a reported ext4 problem at the time, but
2.6.29-rc1 also works just fine)
[    1.962792] tg3.c:v3.94 (August 14, 2008)

As for why it doesn't work on your system, we really need to know what
device driver is involved.  If you send the dmesg output right after
your system booted on 2 6.27 system, where your ethernet device
worked, and a dmesg output after your system booted on a 2.6.28
kernel, where you are having trouble, and your kernel .config from
2.6.28, we probably can help you.  At a guess you probably didn't
configure the right network driver, or maybe for some reason the
ethernet device didn't come up correctly (does ifconfig -a show the
eth0 device?), or some other user/configuration error.  It certainly
isn'ta problem with all "eth cards", as you seem to suggest.
