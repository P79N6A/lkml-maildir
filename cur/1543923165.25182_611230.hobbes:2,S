But doesn't aligning such regions on that alignment break some devices
as that is not what the device is asking for in the BIOS?
And if not, why would we not do this for all devices not just for
virtual machines, if it is such a benefit?
Also, how does this play with the hardware IOMMU chips that provide such
virtualization in hardware for you?
And, we can't accept a patch for 2.6.18, there is no development tree to
apply it to anymore, that is a dead kernel tree.  It needs to be against
2.6.24-rc1 at the latest to have a chance for approval.
Is this a patch that distros are shipping in their Xen versions?
And how does this play with KVM?
thanks,
