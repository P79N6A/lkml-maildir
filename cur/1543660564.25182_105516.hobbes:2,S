Make a user-mode 'main()' test program that calls your function with
the required parameters. Link it with your function and run it either
with gdb or with lots of ordinary printf statements.
You can resolve all missing globals, including functions, with
simple 'ints' as long as they are not accessed in your code. This
lets you test practically anything in user-mode when, if you
screw up, you just have a core file and don't have to re-boot.
Most all of the modules that I write for embedded systems are
initially tested this way. That lets me get linked-lists and
other easy-to-muck-up things working correctly before I throw
it off the cliff, hoping it will fly. My user-mode code calls
ISRs, actually accessing hardware in most cases (iopl(3) allows
this).
Also, PCI interrupts are level interrupts. Do not enable interrupts
in your ISR until you have serviced the reason why you got the
interrupt in the first place, otherwise the ISR will be interrupted
by the same interrupt...,
 by the same interrupt...,
  by the same interrupt...,
   until you crash.
