I'd rather keep it, even with bitrot - it was non-trivial to get 
correct, and found many surprises in the code; most notably, it can detect
1) PTE writes to pages not declared as page tables
2) Failure to allocate or de-allocate page tables using the paravirt-ops API
3) PTE writes using the wrong level operations
These are most useful properties; in fact, I would like to extend the 
code for 64-bit paravirt-ops and 4-level paging, so rather not kill it 
until then.
I never merged the whole bit upstream because it added a field to struct 
page.
