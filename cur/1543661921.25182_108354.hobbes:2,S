Because Linus asked for access control support, not audit logging 
support, it is not surprising that logging models don't fit so well.

False: capabilities is now a removable module, which is what Linus asked 
for.

Because doing so would have required approx. 6-10X as many LSM hooks as 
the current LSM. Speak up if you think LSM should be 10X bigger to be 
able to support Common Criteria standards compliant audit logging ...

And I actually like that plan. But I still believe it to be too radical 
for 2.6. It has many nice properties, but is much more invasive to the 
kernel. I think it is a very interesting idea for 2.7, and should be 
floated past the maintainers who will be impacted to see if it has a 
hope in hell.
