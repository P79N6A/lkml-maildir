No, we map enough space to map 4G (~4 pages), but we don't actually map
4G.  If a hole happened to start within that 4 page mapping, then the
memory still wouldn't be available for allocation.
I think this is a bit of a spurious argument though, since if it were
really a problem we'd have to worry about holes hitting the kernel image
too.  As far as I can see, that's not considered to be a problem.
I think the real point is that there's currently a subtle dependency
between head.S and bootmem allocation which happens between start_kernel
and pagetable_init.  Your patch preventing over-mapping should make them
easier to smoke out as it currently stands, but eliminating the problem
by making alloc_bootmem create the mappings for itself does have
appeal.  There would still be the dependency on head.S to map the kernel
itself and the bootmem allocator bitmap.
