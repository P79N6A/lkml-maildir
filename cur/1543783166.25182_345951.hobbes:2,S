Mmm.. curious sequence in the first 512 bytes of
the DWL-G730AP firmware binary.  It has this
sequence of bytes repeated several times:
   81 40 20 10 08 04 02 81 40 20 10 08 04 02 ...
That should be recognizable to somebody, I think.
I'll try loading the works into another ARM
system I have here, and see (1) if it runs as-is,
and (2) what the disassembly shows.
I'd certainly like to get source for my 730AP here,
as it seems to be a bit buggy on the WEP implementation.
Cheers
