actually the sector based access that is made to modern drives is a very 
primitive filesystem. if you go back to the days of the MFM and RLL drives 
you had the computer sending the raw bitstreams to the drives, but with 
SCSI and IDE this stopped and you instead a higher level logical block to 
the drive and it deals with the details of getting it to and from the 
platter.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
