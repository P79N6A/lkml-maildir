fully agree with it. We need to get a working version first.
FYI, in OVZ we recently added such optimizations: reserves like in TCP/IP,
e.g. for kmemsize, numfile these reserves are done on task-basis for
fast charges/uncharges w/o involving lock operations.
On task exit reserves are returned back to the beancounter.
As it demonstrated atomic counters can be replaced with
task-reserves on the next step.
Thanks,
Kirill
