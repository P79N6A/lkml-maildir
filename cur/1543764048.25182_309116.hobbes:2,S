Yes, with 'noapic' the system boots normally and the clock runs at normal
speed.
dmesg of 2.6.11.6 without any command line options. (default: ACPI
enabled, APIC enabled):

/proc/interrupts on 2.6.11.6 with ACPI enabled, APIC enabled:

dmesg of 2.6.11.6 with 'noapic' command line option:

/proc/interrupts on 2.6.11.6 with 'noapic':

	(clock runs normally)
Are you thinking of blacklisting the APIC on this system until we figure
