SCO Just sent over a list of contaminated files with a "bill of health" 
certification for Linux that if we remove the identified files
they will certify our Linux distribution as clean. They are also sending 
out some form of statement that we are
not affiliated with them, and that we are competitors of SCO since we 
use Linux. They claim the following and I have
a listing of files, lines numbers, etc. they told us we must remove in 
order for our Linux appliances to be considered
"clean." This info might be useful to others. They have a cert program 
to remove the areas.
Here it is. I can get the line numbers of the file and their names if 
anyone needs it, but the list is very big.
RCU
46 files
109,688 lines
NUMA
101 files
56,587 lines
JFS
44 files
32,224 lines
XFS
173 Files
119,130 lines
SMP
1,185 files
829,393 lines
Total files/lines they [allege] contains SCO source code
1,549 files
1,147,022 lines
If you guys want the specific line numbers and filenames, I will ask 
them to post the specific filenames/line numbers they claim
are theirs. They stated we can ship Linux with fear of being sued if we 
comply with their Linux Certification Program.
