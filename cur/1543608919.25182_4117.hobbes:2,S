Hm, this is funny:

Judging by the PID, that was supposed to be 'keventd'.  It must be upset
over losing part of its name, although right now it just seems content with
eating up 60% of my CPU time:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM COMMAND
    5 root      19   0     0    0     0 RW   62.3  0.0 ntd
Problem is apparently that it was GCC 3.0.  Serves me right for forgetting
that even though 2.2.19 was compiled with egcs 1.1.2, I've upgraded
compilers since then.  Oh well.  Since I am sending this e-mail from the
machine it isn't too bad. Now to dig up a suitable compiler...
