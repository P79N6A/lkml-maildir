I may have probably found the bug,.. or at least some valuable
information about it.
It seems like it's actually the DMA who is responsible for the errors.
Until now I've completed 3 rund where I validated all files via their
sha512 sums,... and no errors were found.
I did this only on the PATA drives,... not yet on the SATA drives (and
remember, the issue happened on both drive types)
1) How do I deactivate DMA for an SATA drive?
2) How can I find out definitely if Windows uses DMA for a drive or not.
The hardware management shows for the primary IDE controller an
activated DMA. But the diff was so slow under Windows, that I assume
that this may be wrong.
Does this give you any further idea about the possible reason for the
issue? Is it possible a driver error (for that specific chipsets)? Or
hardware error?
Or can I try any other things?
Thanks and best wishes,
Chris.
