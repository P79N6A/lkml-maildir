Its still broken - if it uses DMA, the ide core will call ide_dma_on,
which will call config_for_dma(), which will call ide_config_drive_speed,
which will then call ide_dma_on, etc.
Sorry, I don't have a solution off hand for this.  I just wish that
the IDE core didn't change in these incompatible ways during a stable
kernel release.
