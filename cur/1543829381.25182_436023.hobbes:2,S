Subject: [PATCH 1/2] [PATCH] USB: get USB suspend to work again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
Yeah, it's a hack, but it is only temporary until Alan's patches
reworking this area make it in.  We really should not care what devices
below us are doing, especially when we do not really know what type of
devices they are.  This patch relies on the fact that the endpoint
devices do not have a driver assigned to us.
