...it gets "Port busy" when it tries to access the RTC ports that the
RTC driver built into the kernel already has opened exclusively. At
least, that's my understanding of the situation at present.

Are we?
Unless I've misunderstood the arguments so far, the aim is to take the
RTC driver out of the kernel altogether and replace it with a usermode
driver to do the same thing. As I see it, that opens up far too many
problems to be seriously considered, not least the fact that setting
the RTC is not necessarily a root-only operation.

True, but that's not what people appear to be talking about.
Best wishes from Riley.
