Hi All,
I think my pc got some kind of AI:-) Yesterday I exported the scsi cdrom
via nfs. Today, its very amusingly, my scsi cdrom opens the drawer
suddenly. It's surely the fifth times this evening on which I close the
drawer again 8).
Is this behavior normal;-) Is my PC bored?
And No it's not a joke!
greets
Marc
