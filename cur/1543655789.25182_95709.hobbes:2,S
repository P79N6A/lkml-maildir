Has anyone noticed some serious degradation in performance using AIC7xxx
driver in 2.5.48?
I have a system with Intel's SL2 dual PIII Xeon 933 with on board scsi
adaptec.
When I load the 2.4.19 kernel, everything is fine.
Using 2.5.48, when I login it takes it sometimes up to 1 minute 34 seconds
to return me a prompt and good luck with "ps".
No errors or messages though.
I have not tried it with 2.5.51 to see if anything changed. 
Is this known?
