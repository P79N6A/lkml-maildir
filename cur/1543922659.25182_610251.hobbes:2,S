What kind of code is not accepted into the mainline kernel tree for good
reasons?  What are these reasons?  What specific code are you talking
about?
I'm trying to compile a list of all known external modules and drivers
and work to get them included in the main kernel tree to help prevent
these kinds of things.  If you know of any that are not on the list at:
	
http://linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/OutOfTreeDrivers
please feel free to add them, or email me with the needed information
and I will add them to the list.
thanks,
