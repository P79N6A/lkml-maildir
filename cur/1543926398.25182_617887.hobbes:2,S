I had implemented SLOB in userspace, so I resynched and think I
found your problem. Sorry for the attachment format -- this mailer
isn't the best. I'm really computer illiterate when it comes to
userspace...
Anyway, I'm really happy to see you're testing and using SLOB
upstream :) Is there any particular reason that you're using it?
Thanks,
Nick
Previously, it would be possible for prev->next to point to &free_slob_pages,
and thus we would try to move a list onto itself, and bad things would
happen.
It seems a bit hairy to be doing list operations with the list marker as an
entry, rather than a head, but...
