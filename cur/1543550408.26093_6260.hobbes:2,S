Now that's the problem. Claiming that redhat owns gcc (which is owned by
the FSF) is one of the major points in this discussion. I am sure you just
made a joke, but I miss the smileys...

The same, see above :( Go through the changelog and you will see that
drepper is by far not the only coder. Hey, I even see @suse in there. A
lot! So what's up with glibc? Did you fell for some company's marketing
droids? Surely you didn't...

I wouldn't mind, either, if this didn't mean that programs compiled
on rehdat need redhat versions of the development toolchain / runtime
environment to use them :(
