Something was strange.. Now I get the errors.. But the funny thing is:
when downloading the file there's no problem at all. Uploading the same
file results in the attached dmesg.. So, something is fishy in that code
;)

Whops. I included the module in the kernel ;) But the errors ought to be
the same.. Hm..

Well.. Not much in the logs.. I rebooted with 2.4.20 ;)

Creepy..
