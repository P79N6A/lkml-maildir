Subject: [patch/RFC 2.6.18-rc] platform_device_probe(), to conserve memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/3/155

This defines a new platform_driver_probe() method allowing the driver's
probe() method, and its support code+data, to safely live in __init
sections for common system configurations.
Many system-on-chip processors could benefit from this API to the tune
of saving hundreds to thousands of bytes per driver, which is currently
wasted holding code which can never be called after system startup yet may
not be removed.   It may not be removed because of the linkage requirement
that pointers to init section code (like, ideally, probe support) must
not live in sections that persist after that section is removed (like
driver methods) when those pointers would be invalid.
