Subject: [PATCH] ide-io.c, kernel 2.4.22 Fix for IO stats in /proc/partitions, was Re: sard/iostat disk I/O statistics/accounting for 2.5.8-pre3

I found the cause of ide disks' ios_in_flight going negative in
/proc/partitions.
It's due to unbalanced calls to up_ios and down_ios.  After an
explicit drive command, ide-io.c's ide_end_drive_cmd calls
end_that_request_last which eventually calls down_ios to decrement
ios_in_flight, however there is no corresponding call to up_ios when
the command is initiated.
My guess is that ios_in_flight goes negative when the drive is idle
because many people run hdparm in an init script, and this decrements
ios_in_flight early on.  It stays off center from there.
The following hack to ide_end_drive_cmd is a workaround, I would
rather call up_ios appropriately, so that explicit ide commands are
properly accounted.  However I'm having a hard time identifying all
the places that initiate a low-level drive command.  I'll look into a
proper fix, but someone else probably knows the ide layer better than
me.
