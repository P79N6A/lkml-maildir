Thanks - That's not what I meant. I've found very little in the way of a
HOWTO and iBCS. By coherent I meant clear and together. (Gee is Coherent
the OS still around?)
I have picked up the latest tarball from
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/Linux/BETA/ibcs2/.
It doesn't come close to compiling, blows up on the first thing it tries
to compile:
emulate.c:36: asm/uaccess.h: No such file or directory  ???
*bang*
*boom*
*crash*
I also looked at 
http://www.hulcote.com
 - nothing there re x286emul that
I could find. ??
I'm trying to get a client into Linux - I really, really, really don't
want to have to go to SCO.
Thanks
Steve
