Doing that inside the boundaries of the time constrains imposed by a 
scheduler, is the interesting part. Given also that the size (and members) 
of it (matrix) is dynamic.
Also, a "wakup matrix" (if the name correctly pictures what it is for) 
would help with latencies and priority inheritance, but not for 
global fairness.
The maniacal fairness focus we're seeing now, is due to the fact the 
mainline can have extremely unfair behaviour under certain conditions. 
IMO fairness, although important, should not be main objective of the 
scheduler rewrite. Simplification and predictability should be on higher 
priority, with interactivity achievements bound to decent fariness 
constraints.
