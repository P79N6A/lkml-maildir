OK, but it's much easier to use a hierarchical system as a flat system
(just don't create children) than a flat system as a hierarchical
system. And others do seem to want a hierarchy for their process
groupings.

That doesn't seem like an abuse to me at all - you're controlling what
IPC object a given name (shm_id, sem_id or msg_id) refers to for any
given group of processes.

They're very similar, I agree. An important difference is that things
like pid/mount namespaces are simply ways of controlling the
visibility of existing unix concepts, such as processes or
filesystems. You don't need additional configuration to make them
useful, as unix already has standard ways of manipulating them.
Things like resource controllers typically require additional
configuration to control how much resources each group of processes
can consume, etc. Also, it appears to be much more common to want to
move tasks between different resource controllers than to move them
between different namespaces. (And in order to configure and move, you
need to be able to name)
The configuration, naming and movement are the features that my
container patch provides on top of the features that nsproxy provides
for namespaces.

What you're calling a "namespace", I'm calling a "subsystem state".
Essentially they're the same thing. The important thing that generic
containers provide is a standard way to manipulate "subsystem states"
or "namespaces".
