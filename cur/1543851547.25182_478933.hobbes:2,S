Okay.

Okay.

Defining a reset function would be better.

So you were thinking of doing it in security.h?

Yes.

Which is irrelevant since the CacheFiles module doesn't make syscalls.

That'd probably be sufficient since at least you could tell them apart.

I've done this and got it working with Karl's help.
In cachefilesd.te, I have:
	...
	type cachefilesd_t;
	type cachefilesd_exec_t;
	domain_type(cachefilesd_t)
	init_daemon_domain(cachefilesd_t, cachefilesd_exec_t)
	require { type kernel_t; }
	type cachefiles_kernel_t;
	domain_type(cachefiles_kernel_t)
	type_transition cachefilesd_t kernel_t : process cachefiles_kernel_t;
	...
Then I added a CacheFiles hook to do:
	static int selinux_cachefiles_getsid(u32 secid, u32 *modsecid)
	{
		return security_transition_sid(secid, SECINITSID_KERNEL,
					       SECCLASS_PROCESS, modsecid);
	}
It takes the daemon's security ID and translates it to the module's security
ID.
The way I was thinking about it is that a CacheFiles cache has a presence in
the kernel that lasts as long as the cache is in active service.  This could
be considered the equivalent of a process, although it doesn't have a
task_struct of its own; but rather makes use of the task_struct of processes
that want to use the service.

Indeed; but once NFS had a SID, the two would then be the same.

If the rule isn't there then the cache would refuse to start if SELinux is in
enforcing mode, assuming security_transition_sid() returns an error in that
case.  Otherwise it'll run in cachefilesd's context, I think, which it will
cause it to give an error and refuse to cache in enforcing mode because that
context doesn't permit it to do certain things it checks for (like creating
files and directories).

Yep...  I got that one wrong.

And again.
Anyway, I'll expand what I've done and give it a go.  I may find compelling
reasons[*] not to do it this way.  I can always ditch the patches after all...
[*] Overzealous auditing most probably.
