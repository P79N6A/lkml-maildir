It doesn't work for any filesystem that needs slightly fancy locking.
That and the reason that's an interface that doesn't fit into our
layering is why I want to get rid of it.  Note that fops->kernel_write
might in fact use ->perform_write with an actor as Nick suggested.
I'm not quite sure how it'll look like - I'd rather take care of the
buffered write path first and then handle this issue once the first
changes have stabilized.

Why do you need your own low level buffered write functionality?  As in
past times when filesystems want to come up I'd like to have a very
good exaplanation on why you think it's needed and whether we shouldn't
improve the generic buffered write code instead.  This codepath is so nasty
that any duplication will be a maintaince horror.
