It's a lot more complicated than that, I'm afraid. ahci doesn't even
have the resume/suspend methods defined, plus it needs more work than
piix on resume.
libata should define a default suspend hook for devices that haven't
added their own, to prevent accidents with people trying to suspend
devices that haven't been fixed up. It's a data integrity issue!
