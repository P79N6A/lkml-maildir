Thanks for this info. I just removed the journal and now have / mounted 
permanently as ext2. -mm9 got to login without a problem. I deliberately kept 
my /home volume as ext3 but commented it out in /etc/fstab.
I logged in as root and did:
mount -t ext3 /dev/discs/disc0/part3 /home
This also worked fine, I could read all the files on the volume. However, when 
I did:
touch /home/tmp
sync
The kernel barfed out the attached junk and the file was never committed. The 
volume was not corrupted as I was able to reboot with -mm6 and all is fine. 
tmp does not exist on the volume.
Presumably this is of more help to you. Since / is now ext2, I'm unencumbered 
and so will be able to test anything you like.
Cheers,
Alistair.
