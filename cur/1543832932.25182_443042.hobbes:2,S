Alan/Jeff/Mark,
Is there anything else I can do to further troubleshoot this problem now 
that we have the failed opcode(s)?  Again, there is never any corruption 
on these drives, so it is more of an annoyance than anything else.
Other people also have this problem with these drives if you search Google 
but I am not sure they are aware of where to report their errors/problems.
opcode=0x35 & opcode=0xca
Justin.
