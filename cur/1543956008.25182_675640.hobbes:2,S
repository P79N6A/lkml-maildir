OK, after seeing this used in the Xen driver, I'm even less a fan of the
name.  Mostly because it doesn't actually prepare *pages* to be onlined.
It prepares the zones/pgdats and notifies that pages might soon be
online.  Can you think of any better names?
grow_and_notify...??
It's also a bit funky because you're calling the online notifiers, but
you're not actually onlining the pages, yet.  Does that have any
repercussions?
