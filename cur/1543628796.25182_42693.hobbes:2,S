Dave,
We only really need one of the new "eh" handlers,
either:
  eh_device_reset_handler() or
  eh_bus_reset_handler()
to be implemented in ide-scsi.c in order to go forward.
Assuming we pick the first one, perhaps someone could
tell me, from the context of ide-scsi, how to (politely) 
reset the ATAPI device it is referring to?
[A similar approach will suffice for any other scsi drivers
"broken" by the removal of abort() and reset(). Eric
Youngdale warned of their impending removal about 3 years
ago!]
