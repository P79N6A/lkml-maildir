Hi!.
A solution is enlarge the message buffer at kernel/printk.c but this is
not a safety solution.
Well, I have a little kernel patch and two userland programs that make
printk blocking/unblocking when you want. I also disable klogd and
syslogd daemons and execute "cat /proc/kmsg > myfile" to collect
messages. Send me an e-mail if you are interested in them.
Bye.
