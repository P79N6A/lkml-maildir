Additional patch info:
This patch solves the race mentioned above via introducing per super 
block list of dentries which are being held indirectly by it's child 
which is going away. This usually happens when a child is dput()'ed last 
time and is holding it's parent reference though it is not in any lists 
already and can't be found anywhere. To make sure that 
shrink_dcache_parent() can't shrink dcache tree because of a real 
reference and not such indirect one we check a race condition by looking 
through dcache_shrinker list. If the current dentry is found on 
dcache_shrinker list than it is being referenced indirectly as described 
above and should be waited for, otherwise we really can't shrink the tree.
Why is it so hacky? We tried to develop a solution which minimally 
influences perfomance, not slowdowning a fast path and not introducing 
lock contention via widening existing locks. I'll be happy if someone 
fixes it more efficiently.
