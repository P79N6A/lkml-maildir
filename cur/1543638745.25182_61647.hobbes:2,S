Its working nicely for me in 2.4.19 and 2.4.19-ac1. The 2.4.19-ac3 tree
has a bug in pci_enable_device which will stop it working if built with
some compilers (by chance it works ok the way I tested it). Thats fixed
in ac4.
The changes in the recent i810 audio are
- Being more pessimistic in our interpretation of codec power up
- Turning on EAPD in case the BIOS didn't do so at boot up
Longer term full EAPD control as we do with the cs46xx is on my list,
paticularly as i8xx laptops are becoming common . (EAPD is the amplifier
power controller)
