That's true. It happens very frequently in kdump case where underlying device
can very well have pending interrupts while second kernel is booting.
Currently we allow the kernel to disable that irq line and we boot the kernel
with "irqpoll" so that device still operates in polling mode.
But getting this fixed will help. If device interrupts are enabled only after
driver has had a chance to reset the device, things will be better, at least
from kdump perspective.
Thanks
