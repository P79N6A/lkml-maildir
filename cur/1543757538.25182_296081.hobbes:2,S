What's the format of /sys/devices/.../pools (Name of pool, ? ? ? ?) ?  Can the 
memory consumption be derived from it? 
Here is what the ohci pools look during data read (Kino->Capture) and after 
closing Kino -
During Kino Capture
[root@localhost pci0000:00]# cat ./0000:00:0a.0/0000:02:00.0/pools
poolinfo - 0.1
