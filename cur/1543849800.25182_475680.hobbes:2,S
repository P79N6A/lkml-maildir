It turned out that the real thing that was triggering the bug
for me was unloading and reloading the ip_nat module without
also reloading ip_conntrack.
The connection tracking tuple would remain in the kernel, visible
in /proc/net/ip_conntrack, but no longer linked to the SNAT rule.
I'd consider this a bug, but very few users will ever be affected.
The workaround for me was to remove my hand-cracted iptables
rules from ppp's ip-up.local and move them to the distro-supplied
iptables firewall instead.  The only downside is that I must now
hardcode the destination ip of the SNAT rule because it's too early
to read the interface address of ppp0.
