Isn't this going to be a showstopper?  If I understand the scheduler
correctly, a nice -20 task is not guaranteed to preempt a nice -19 task,
if the scheduler decides that one is more CPU bound than the other and
lowers its dynamic priority.  The design of JACK, however, requires the
higher priority threads to *always* preempt the lower ones.
