It "should" work with the above situation, as we only decrement the
module count when the tty device structure that is bound to a driver is
freed, and increment it when it is created.  So if those functions work
properly with regards to memory management, the module reference
counting should also work.
Hm, well I hope so at least :)
Let me know if your tests show up any problems.
