Question is: who is holding interrupts off for so long?
It might be better to implement a detection scheme inside
the timer interrupt handler: if the time since last interrupt
exceeds two ticks, whine and drop a backtrace.
That backtrace will point up into the local_irq_enable() in
the offending code, and we can go fix it?
