Oh I don't think so. Everyone thinks Christoph has it in for their
project (me included quite often). He's just blessed with a lot of taste
and determination to enforce it, and cursed (or perhaps blessed) with
the ability to explain bluntly and clearly his opinion.
gid hacks are not a good long term plan.
Can we use capabilities, if not - why not and how do we fix it so we can
do the job right. Do we need some more capability bits that are
implicitly inherited and not touched by setuidness ?
