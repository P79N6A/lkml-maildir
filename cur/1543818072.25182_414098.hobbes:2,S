It's already done in 2.6.17-rc1 for x86_64:
Processor type and feature --> Function reordering
arch/x86_64/Kconfig:
config REORDER
        bool "Function reordering"
        default n
        help
         This option enables the toolchain to reorder functions for a more
         optimal TLB usage. If you have pretty much any version of binutils,
         this can increase your kernel build time by roughly one minute.
