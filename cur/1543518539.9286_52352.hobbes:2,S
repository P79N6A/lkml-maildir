Sorry, I did not check completely the code. *NOW*, my problem remains the
following: If a thread does select() on a file descriptor that is closed
during the select() wait (the f_count is 1), do you think that it is a
good behaviour that the thread remains blocked forever, since nothing
will ever happen on this file descriptor, since unreachable after close()
(in sys_close(), the file pointer is nullified).
My understanding is that the thread should be awaken only if waiting on
POLLERR event, which corresponds to the fact that any attempt to do
anything on the file descriptor will return an error. I think that this
a coherent behaviour.
