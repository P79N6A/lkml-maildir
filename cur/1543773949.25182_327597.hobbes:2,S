I'm confused why everything has to be remounted nosuid.  I understand
enforcing synthetics to be mounted nosuid, but not the rest of the
file systems.  I thought all the problems revolving around the private
namespace solution where the FUSE team's desire to have per-user
namespace and/or per-session namespace versus per-process namespace.
