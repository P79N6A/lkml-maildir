..
Yeah.  This particular bug first appeared when NOHZ & HPET were added.
Somebody once suggested it had something to do with an SMI interrupt
happening in the midst of HPET calibration or some such thing.
But nobody who works on the HPET code has ever shown more than a casual
interest in helping to track down and fix whatever the problem is.
