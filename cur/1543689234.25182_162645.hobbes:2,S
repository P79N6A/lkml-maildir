I can think of two possible causes here. #1 is that something hung the
scsi bus because of a crash - be it kernel, mt, hardware whatever. The
other one some people hit with tape drives is that they don't have
disconnect enabled on the drive (check your drive manuals). With
disconnect disabled the tape will hog the bus for the entire time it
is doing a command.  
The tapes I have don't seem to take long enough to fsf (even if they are
past the last marker) to worry too much however.
Do you also get messages about scsi timeouts
What card ?
