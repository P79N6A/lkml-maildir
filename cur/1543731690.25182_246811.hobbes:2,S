I really don't think so.  This macro is also used at runtime, so there
it would return CPUs that aren't online.
It does look like all runtime uses in sched.c pass node_to_cpumask
through any_online_cpu(), so at least for the scheduler, the change may
be safe, but you'd have to audit all other runtime uses.
