It transfers more bytes than requested on a read. If you asked for
four bytes, you got eight.
Note: one nasty property of this file in spufs is that you can only
read multiples of four bytes in the first place, there is no way to
atomically put back a few bytes into the hardware register, so reading
less than four bytes returns -EINVAL. Asking for more than four
should return the largest possible multiple of four.
