Stephen,
The patchset in question is just a major code movement - basically to
move all in-kernel tests to live under a toplevel tests/ directory. As
such, all the stakeholders have acked the patchset, but it does look
like this is a big enough change to be deferred to the next merge
window.
Given that there is general agreement about the patchset, could you
please pull in the changes into the linux-next tree?
Sam has setup a git tree for this and you can pull from:
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/tests.git
