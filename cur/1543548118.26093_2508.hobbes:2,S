I've seen the same when the switch and nic (tulip) do not seem to sense
the same mode.. I have to force the tulip-driver to use 100Mbpx fullduplex
and force it to the switch also. This way everything is happy.
When the nic and switch have different transfer modes, connections to the
10Mbps boxes work well (at the full 10Mbps), but connections to the
100Mbps boxes are VERY slow. Something like 3-10k/s just like you said.
On the other hand, if you get good transfer rates between linux-boxes this
migth not be your problem..
