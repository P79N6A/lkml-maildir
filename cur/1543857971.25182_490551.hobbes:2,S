Btw, if you still want to use "get_kernel_version" or whatever the broken 
program was, I'd suggest:
 - extend the check to verify that the version number that follows looks 
   valid. It had better be something like a number with dots and perhaps a 
   "v" in front of it or something.
 - extend the check to check that it has parenthesis and a date there 
   somewhere too.
In other words, make the string grep really REALLY anal. Rather than grep 
for something totally trivial like "Linux version " that is so common that 
I could easily see it finding that particular string sequence in any 
random binary, not just the Linux kernel (eg some internal thing that says 
"tested with Linux version 2.6")
