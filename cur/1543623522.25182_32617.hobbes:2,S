Comment #1: Please observe the difference between cleanup and development.
 I think your patches already went too far under the "cleanup" heading.
Comment #2: We need a nice, general interface for the usual things,
 and a very detailed direct-to-hardware interface for special purposes.

 and back. Take care of passwords on disks. Unstroke a 32+GB disk. Etc.]
