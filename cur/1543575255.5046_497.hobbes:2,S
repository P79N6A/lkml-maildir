	Nothing can "prevent" them from shooting themselves in the foot,
even taking away their guns and ammunition (removing it from the kernel)
is rarely sufficient for the really skillfull and determined foot
shooters (they want it, they'll patch it back in and complain about the
inconvenience).
	We can make it more difficult and make sure they understand that
it's a self inflicted injury when it happens to them, but we can not
prevent it.

between software engineers who are attempting to create fool proof programs
and the Universe which is attempting to create bigger and better fools."
