Okay, like 3rd attempt trying to get past that STUPID spammer filter.
----- Forwarded message from Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@lightside.dhis.org> -----
I accidentally created a huge postscript file.  As a result, when compiling
it failed since it filled the partition as it only had 2mb avail.  So I
removed the postscript file, and ended up with 140MB free, but at the same
time 100% of space usage when it really should had been a 67%.
Remounting the partition fixed it.
