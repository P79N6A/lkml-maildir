Subject: [RFC] kernel/pid.c pid allocation wierdness

Hi.
I'm looking at how alloc_pid() works and can't understand
one (simple/stupid) thing.
It first kmem_cache_alloc()-s a strct pid, then calls
alloc_pidmap() and at the end it taks a global pidmap_lock()
to add new pid to hash.
The question is - why does alloc_pidmap() use at least
two atomic ops and potentially loop to find a zero bit
in pidmap? Why not call alloc_pidmap() under pidmap_lock
and find zero pid in pidmap w/o any loops and atomics?
The same is for free_pid(). Do I miss something?
Thank,
Pavel
