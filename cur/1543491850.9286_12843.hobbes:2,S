Yes, and bind 8.1.2 compiled fine on my systems as well, I just wonder
why the change in 2.2.5's un.h from 2.0.36's, the latters version of un.h
which I used to compile bind 8.2.
I also wonder why Red Hat machines appear to compile ths fine but the two
Slackware 3.6 boxes I have wouldn't (one 2.2.4, other 2.2.5).
Curious...
