Hi Giacomo,
I use udev since its out..and haven't had any big problems.
The database of know and often needed device notes increases.
To your question which Distro do you use?
For the udev you also need so called udev-rules and perms. do you have 
them in /etc/conf.d/ or etc/env? which version of  udev you are using rn?
