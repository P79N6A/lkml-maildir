How would you not get that if you had a wrapper around md which made it
into an dm personality/target?
Besides, stacking between dm devices so far (ie, if I look how kpartx
does it, or LVM2 on top of MPIO etc, which works just fine) is via the
block device layer anyway - and nothing stops you from putting md on top
of LVM2 LVs either.
I use the regularly to play with md and other stuff...
So I remain unconvinced that code duplication is worth it for more than
"hark we want it so!" ;-)
