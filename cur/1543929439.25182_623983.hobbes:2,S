We do have some current code in the network stack that fails miserably
when  register_sysctl_table returns NULL, and there are explicit
checks for that.
Grr.
I had forgotten about that.
I expect the right answer is to simply have code ignore the fact
that register_sysctl_xxxx returns NULL, and not error on it.
The alternative is to get fancy and have everyone check the
return code and make the return type an IS_ERR thing.  That seems
a lot more trouble then it is worth.
We can probably define it as register_sysctl_xxxx always returns
a token that must be passed to unregister_sysctl, and no errors
will be reported except to dmesg.  That at sounds simple sane
and supportable from where we are now.
