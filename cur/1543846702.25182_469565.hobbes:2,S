I've been travelling for the past month, so pardon the late tuning in here.
I've *never* encountered a drive that had this problem.
Controllers, yes, and those are easily dealt with in the chipset drivers.
But never drives.  Not since 1992 when I first took up Linux IDE stuff.
I have some 7-year old IBM drives here, and they certainly don't have
this problem either (but they do have working TCQ etc..).
I suspect Sergei simply had a bad controller card at the time.
Cheers
