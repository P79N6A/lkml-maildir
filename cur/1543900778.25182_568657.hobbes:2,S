All this code is totally different in Greg's development tree, so this
fix really is only applicable to 2.6.22.x.
I suppose we could apply this to -stable, but given GFP_KERNEL's present behaviour
for small allocations it's pretty theoretical.
Unless you've enabled fault-injection in the page allocator, or if you get
oom-killed in that allocation.  In which case your kernel is dead.
So hm, perhaps you'd best send this to stable@kernel.org.
