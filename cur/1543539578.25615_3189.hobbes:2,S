For those that this is a concern.....
For those that this is not a concern.....
Regardless......I have not solved the call from USER-SPACE that is
standard.
hdparm -I /dev/hdx
This returns wrong byte order stuff and it is a mess to look at.
However it does not hurt the kernel or segfault as before.
I do not know if I can fix 2.0 kernels, however I will try.....
I hope the have a SCSI task parser by late afternoon or worst case monday.
Now leave me alone, and maybe consider fixing it yourself!
Goodbye for now.

FYI- I enjoy skeet ...... 23->25 is standard at 35->50 yards.
