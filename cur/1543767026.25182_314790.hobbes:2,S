Returning 0 causes caller to immediately repeat operation causing the
loop and 100% CPU utiluization as was reported. If ENOSYS is not
acceptable (after all the problem is sysfs-specific, other fs-es
either support write or they don't for entire volume) I'd say (looking
at the descripptions) we should use ENXIO instead of EBADF:
[ENXIO] 
A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside
the capabilities of the device.
[EBADF] 
The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.
We have a valid FD and it was opened for wrinting, so EBADF is not
really applicable. But then I may be talking complete gibberish...
