As a practical measure the 32bit hierarchical numeric namespace is extremely
sparsely populated.  So even if there are things that we never intend to export
again it doesn't hurt to reserve the number for them so we don't confuse something
that thought the number actually meant something.
In the worst case we want to comment out the entry so we keep the number
reserved even if we don't use it.
To see if there are entries we are not currently using just requires
going through the loop.

For DEFINE in sysctl.h ; do
   if ! grep -r DEFINE /usr/src/linux/ ; then
   	echo DEFINE not used.
   fi
done
