Hello,
The patch that adds the git tag in the localversion is screwing klive a
bit, see the 2.6.13-g* entries in
http://klive.cpushare.com/?branch=unknown
Those are supposed to go in the homepage but they're not recognized
anymore due the git tag and so they go in the unknown page.
So either we add a branch name in /proc/branch (for mainline that will
be "2.6.13 mainline", that tells the release number and the branch, or I
shall do a bit more of regexp on the localversion). The branch tag has
the advantage of being able to more reliably recognize non-mainline
kernels as well, klive was made for mainline, I didn't expect so many
users with vendor kernels, but that's ok as long as the regexp on uname
-r works ;). The regexp is already falling apart with distro like
debian, so the sort of /proc/branch was suggested by them infact.
Yet another way would be to remove the git tag from the localversion ;),
but I doubt that it would be ok with you since it'd pratically backout
the feature. I don't think it would be enough for you to have the git
tag in /proc, the way I understand it you want it in the uts_release to
avoid overwriting system.map.
Suggestions welcome thanks.
