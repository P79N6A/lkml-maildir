Yes.  If I can't ping it from afar, I can telnet to the .35 kernel and
ping both of the 2.2.2 computers just fine.  It doesn't begin to answer a
ping unless I do something that starts two-way communications (like start
a telnet from the .35 box).
If I'm interacting with the 2.2.2 box, then it doesn't freeze.  If I run
to get an ice-cream bar from the vending machine on the first floor, it's
usually stuck.
I know the stone-age routers we have use vaccuum tubes, so, I wouldn't put
it past them to be brain dead.  :)
