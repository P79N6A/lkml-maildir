Oh, I know what get_module_symbol() does - I just don't understand why drm
would want to use it. There are basically no good uses for it, as far as
I'm concerned.
I assume it's something about allowing modules to be loaded in the wrong
order. Some other drivers did hooks like this in times past. The right
solution was then, and is almost certainly now, to just remove the code in
question and force the correct load order.
Rik? Can this code just go away?
