If a 'newer' ld.so doesn't work it is broken. This version works just
fine with my multiple 'C' libraries.
So I should update it?? And if I do, it won't work? Is this the story?
This one was updated in May of last year.
Its README states, in part; "... the main focus of this package is to
ease the transition to libc6." They seem to have done just fine.
Cheers,
