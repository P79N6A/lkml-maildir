Please do this in user space. The "overflow every 2^32 packets" thing is 
_not_ a problem, if you just gather the statistics at any kind of 
reasonable interval.
I'd hate to penalise performance for something like this. We have
generally avoided locking _entirely_ for statistics, exactly because
people felt that there are major performance issues wrt network packet
handling, and that "perfect statistics" aren't important enough to
penalize performance over.
Remember: "perfect is the enemy of good".
