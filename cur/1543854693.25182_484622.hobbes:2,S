Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c(701): remark #593: variable "ver" was set but 
never used
The source code is
    unsigned int lvtt_value, tmp_value, ver;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
