As Dave Butenhof says so often, threading is a cooperative programming 
model, not a competitive one. The sched_yield function exists for a 
specific purpose, to let one thread decide to allow some other thread to 
run. No matter what the scheduling policy, or even if there is no 
scheduling policy at all, the expectation is that the current thread 
will not continue to run unless there are no other runnable threads in 
the same process. The other important point here is that the yielding 
thread is only cooperating with other threads in its process. The 2.6 
kernel behavior effectively causes the entire process to give up its 
time slice, since the yielding thread has to wait for other processes in 
the system before it can run again. Again, if folks wanted process 
scheduling behavior they would have used fork().
By the way, I've already raised an objection with the Open Group asking 
for more clarification here.
