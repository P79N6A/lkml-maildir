  Existing khttpd code isn't the best implementation on the idea, it's
neither optimized nor particularily well designed. Similar by basic
operation thing that works as a cache and does clean fallback to the
userspace server (khttpd fallback mechanism is primitive and inefficient),
will be much more efficient than this.

  "Should" isn't good enough, it will be nice to know, what kind of design
will cause the performance to be increased so dramatically. So far all
changes still involve heavy modifications in kernel that are as little
portable between systems as in-kernel HTTP caching support.

  Any examples? All other protocols except NFS (that is already in kernel)
require heavy processing before sending responses, and won't benefit
from "generic" solution that really still only benefits one particular
implementation of one particular protocol.

  Properly done in-kernel HTTP support will be more like masquerade and
tunnel modules or NFS -- they are specific for a reason. Existing khttpd
code isn't such a thing, but IMHO it's a step in the right direction.
