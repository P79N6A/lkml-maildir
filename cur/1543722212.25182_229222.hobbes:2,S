It is difficult because disk_dump and scsi_dump try to check checksum of
itself using check_crc_module so as to confirm whether module is
compromised or not.
drivers/scsi/scsi_dump.c:
static int
scsi_dump_sanity_check(struct disk_dump_device *dump_device)
{
        struct scsi_device *sdev = dump_device->device;
        struct Scsi_Host *host = sdev->host;
        int adapter_sanity = 0;
        int sanity = 0;
        if (!check_crc_module()) {
                Err("checksum error. scsi dump module may be compromised.
");
                return -EINVAL;
        }
Therefore, scsi_dump need to be always compiled as independent module.
If scsi_dump is merged with scsi_mod, scsi_mod is not able to be
compiled statically.
