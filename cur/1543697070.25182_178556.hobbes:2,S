Holger Kiehl found a similar leak somewhere in the ipv4 code, possibly
route.c.  We couldn't nail the problem down yet and it could still be
inside a seperate device driver (GPL, outside of kernel tree).
Holger's problem is independent of the one found by the stanford
checker some weeks ago, so there seem to be or have been at least
three memory leaks in the network code.  Could be a single developer
that is simply not careful enough wrt. resource leaks.
David, can you think of an easy way to find all of those leaks?
Easier than waiting for bug reports and hunting them one by one?
