Hi, 
Here goes the fourth release candidate of 2.4.28.
A few small problems showed up in time for another -rc.
Missing exported symbols in the networking area, an ACPI poweroff bugfix, 
aic7xxx compile fix with -Werror, a binfmt_elf underflow enhancement, 
an SCTP fix, and a couple TG3 fixes.
This will become v2.4.28 final if nothing _really_ bad shows up.
Thanks to everybody who has been contributing to make this happen.
