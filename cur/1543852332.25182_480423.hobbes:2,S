Because it suffered from an acute case of being wrong. The blanket patch
proposed by Sergio is also wrong. Both break valid correct and working

The draft patch I posted fixes up precisely the right devices on
precisely the right bridges and nothing else which should mean we now
have a patch that gets all cases right.
