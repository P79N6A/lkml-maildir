Now you've confused me. Your patch seems to unconditionally initialise
the bitfields at startup. I didn't see logic for restricting that
initialisation to an error path.

Except that devfs_register_???dev() (which are in fact minor
variations on the register_???dev() calls) *do not* avoid assigned
majors. That is why I wrote devfs_alloc_major() in the first place.
And while I do think that register_???dev() should in fact do just
what devfs_alloc_major() does, that's not a battle I care to fight. By
writing devfs_alloc_major(), this functionality is optional, and I can
avoid a whole pile of stupid flaming.
Hey, hey! It looks like vger is sending emails again!
