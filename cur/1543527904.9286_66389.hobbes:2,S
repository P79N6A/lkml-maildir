Some more info on this.  With lighter load (dbench 8) I notice about 30%
drop in throughput with 2.3.47 when the buffer cache is cold.  With warm
cache both kernels perform similarly.  With dbench 32 the cold case shows
higher degradation (as noted above) and running with warm cache doesn't help.

OK, I tried this.  Didn't do much.
