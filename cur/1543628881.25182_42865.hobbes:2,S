It's tough to follow, even when you know the code.  While cooking my
config_nonlinear patch I noticed the line you're concerned about and
regarded it with deep suspicion.  My patch does this:
-               page = virt_to_page(__va(phys_addr));
+               page = phys_to_page(phys_addr);
And of course took care that phys_to_page does the right thing in all
cases.

The new config_nonlinear was designed as a cleaner, more powerful
replacement for all non-numa uses of config_discontigmem.
