That's right.
And I will note that historically we used to be much worse
in this area, as we used to walk the page table tree twice
on address space teardown (once to hit the PTE entries, once
to free the page tables).
Happily it is a one-pass algorithm now.
But, within active VMA ranges, we do have to walk all
the bits at least one time.
