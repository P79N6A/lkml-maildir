The entry point is uhci_urb_enqueue().  You can do whatever you like 
there, but bear in mind that it may be called in interrupt context.  
uhci_sprint_schedule() should be fine.
However I don't really see the point.  If the DMA pool allocations are 
so badly messed up that the initial setup is wrong, why bother to 
search any further?
