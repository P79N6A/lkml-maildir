Now with more reliabile passing of boot parameters:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-4.tar.gz
Concerning kernel parameters, I've come to the conclusion that it may
be better to follow the rdev approach (utility that works on a few
ugly but stable binary interfaces) instead of adding a great, elegant,
and bloated boot parameter registry.
Therefore, I'm now preserving the parameter block at 0x90000 (*). SMP
already takes care of its own variables, but you have to compile both
kernels (i.e. the one loading and the one being loaded) with SMP
enabled. E820 seems to take care of ACPI. One remaining problem is the
(VGA) console, because its state changes after booting.
(*) With this added, there's now a bit of backwards optimization in
    the kernel (empty_zero_page and saved_command_line), resulting in
    the wasting of 256 data bytes and some unknown amount of code.
For kernel-discovered parameters (e.g. passing of SCSI bus scan
results to avoid or at leastspeed up the second scan), /proc and
friends, and of course the boot command line, should be sufficient.
