GFS (Global File System) does this with the help of special drive
firmware. They are trying to push dlocks (device locks) into the scsi
standard so multi-initiator setups would be possible without performance
degradation that would be unavoidable if the storage media is used for
implementing locking.
There are also some commercial offerings that have this
kind of functionality.
