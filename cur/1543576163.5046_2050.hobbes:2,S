I'm betting Linus would never go for using tsort to resolve such issues
-- unless tsort output is guaranteed to be stable (the docs for GNU
textutils don't say).  This would be for the same reason that he
rejected the partial ordering in the LINK_FIRST patch -- because it was
only partial ordering and he thinks total ordering is necessary.  For
me, BTW, that's still an article of faith -- I still do not see why
total ordering *is* necessary, but <shrug> thus saith the penguin.
