Hi there,
make oldconfig from 2.6.17.11 to 2.6.18-rc5: This help text doesn't say 
what the right choice should be?  Unclear to me anyway, so I take the 
default, is that bad for an x86 32-bit box?
"
* DMA Engine support
*
Support for DMA engines (DMA_ENGINE) [N/y/?] (NEW) ?
DMA engines offload copy operations from the CPU to dedicated
hardware, allowing the copies to happen asynchronously.
"
Thanks,
Grant.
