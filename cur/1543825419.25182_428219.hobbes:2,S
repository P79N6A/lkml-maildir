Another question about it:
        If the block layer issued a request, which happened to contain
        R ranges of B bad blocks, i.e. 3 ranges of 9 bad-blocks:
                ___b_____bb___________bbbbbb____
        How many retries will incur? 1, 3, 9, or something else?
        If it is 3 or more, then we are even more bad luck :(
Will it be suitable to _automatically_ apply the following retracting
policy on I/O error? Please comment if there's better ways:
