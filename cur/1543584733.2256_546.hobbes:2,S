I disagree, but you probably knew that when you saw the code :)
These macros are not used inside code, they declare entire functions. 
These functions are 100% duplicated across 2-4 protocols.  Duplicated
code means bugs in some portions of the code and no others, more
difficult to maintain, etc.  I even proved this point while developing
the patch -- one of the functions was missing an EXPORT_xxx symbol. 
Using a standard macro automatically fixed this, a small oversight that
had been in the kernel probably for over a year.
