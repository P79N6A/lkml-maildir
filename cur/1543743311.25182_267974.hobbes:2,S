I erred on README.cycladesZ, I'll admit.  My apologies.  I normally contact the 
maintainer *before* making a call like that.  Well, I'm kinda new to this, and 
making mistakes is part of the process.
My unofficial "guidelines" for what needs to be looked at more closely include: 
references to 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, or 2.5 kernels, references to external modules, 
dates of 2002 or earlier, or just a "wait a minute, I don't think that's right". 
Not the prettiest technique, I know.
