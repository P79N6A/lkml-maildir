Hallo,
I have a following problem. My AXP box at least once a week say 
"oops". This is offen connected with with some problems with kswapd.
I dont know what it means but I can offen see in the output
of ps or top something like: kswapd<defunc.
My configuration is:
AXP PC164UX thats means Ruffian,
RAM 512MB,
SCSI SYM53c8xx.
I have tested this with several kernels. Now i have the kernel 
which comes together with Redhat, that means 2.2.16-3. 
This is the result of ./ksymoops < oops.txt:
>WARNING: This version of ksymoops is obsolete.
>WARNING: The current version can be obtained from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
>Options used: -V (default)
>              -o /lib/modules/2.2.16-3/ (default)
>              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
>              -l /proc/modules (default)
>              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
>              -c 1 (default)

If I can help in any way, in dealing with this problem I will be 
happy. So feel free to ask, I am not a specialist, so I simply 
dont know what kind of information I should post here.
