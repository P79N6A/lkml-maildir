I can't answer for anyone but myself, but I personally try to test
both and look for problems in both.
Most patches I submit are against the latest Linus git tree since
Andrew usually handles merging that into -mm just fine. If I'm working
on something that's currently only present in -mm (or radically
different in -mm), then latest -mm is what I work on.
So a little of both.

The 2.6.15-rc5-mm3 patch applies to 2.6.15-rc5 as its name implies.
Take a look at

Sure, that's one way to do it as well.
