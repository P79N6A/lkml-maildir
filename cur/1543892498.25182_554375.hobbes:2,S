DINDEX{1,2} definition varies with LZO flavours (lzo1x, lzo1y etc.),
so its better to leave this macro as such.

Yes. Look better.

't' is size_t, so shouldn't we do this casting while doing OR b/w
unsigned char and size_t ? I'm not sure here.

You pointed out _lots_ of such unnecessary casts. I wonder why author
did these in first place? He aims "unlimited" backward compatibility
but I'm not too sure if removing these castings can break code on any
of archs that Linux supports.

1. Why did you remove (size_t) cast in LHS? It's now like comparison
between signed and unsigned int.
2. Naming is strange. I suggest:
HAVE_IP_OR -> CHECK_IP
HAVE_OP_OR -> CHECK_OP
HAVE_LB_OR -> CHECK_LB

There is no need to have separate LZO_UNALIGNED_OK_{2,4}. If unaligned
access is allowed and is faster than byte-by-byte access, set
UNALIGNED_OK otherwise not.

Here, you are avoiding optimization in case op, m_pos happen to be
(4-byte) aligned.

No header file should ever be without these.

I think, CONFIG_* option is not present for all archs (ARM/PPC?). The
arch is simply picked up as a compilation arg (ARCH=x) or using `uname
-m`. So I think its better to leave this in Makefile as simple list.

I think, get/put_unaligned should not be used on archs where these are
slower than simple byte-by-byte access. I suspect this is the case
where dirty work behind unaligned access is done in s/w (though I have
not done any benchmarks myself).

Yes. I will look into these alignment issues again.

I agree with changes I skipped in this reply.
Thanks for detailed comparison.
