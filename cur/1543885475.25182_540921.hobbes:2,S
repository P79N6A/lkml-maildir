The big question I have is, how well does DWRR fits into the "currently hot" 
scheduling frameworks like CFS? For ex: if the goal is to do
fair (group) scheduling of SCHED_NORMAL tasks, can CFS and DWRR co-exist?
Both seem to be radically different algorithms and my initial impressions 
of them co-existing is "No", but would be glad to be corrected if I am
wrong. If they can't co-exist, then we need a different way of doing
group scheduling on top of CFS, as that is gaining more popularity on
account of better handling of interactivity.
Tong,
	I understand a center hallmark of DWRR is SMP fairness.
Have you considered how bad/good the other alternative to achieve SMP fairness 
which is in vogue today : pressure/weight based balancing (ex: smpnice and 
CKRM CPU scheduler - ckrm.sourceforge.net/downloads/ckrm-ols03-slides.pdf)?
