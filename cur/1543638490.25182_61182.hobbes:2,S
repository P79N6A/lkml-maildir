I could try "fast is beautiful" or "beauty is in the eye of the beholder", 
but I think I'll stick with "beauty isn't the point just now".

Great.  Well, both the locking locality of anonymous pages and the dispersion 
of mmaped pages could be improved considrably, so maybe I'll play around with 
those a little.  Taking a wild guess, it might be good for another 5-10% 
overhead reduction, and won't impact the basic structure.

That doesn't sound like a rmap problem per se.  Is the test posted?

It will be worth it when we finally have a system that swaps well and doesn't 
die if you throw a lot of disk IO at it (like BSD).  It will be doubly worth 
it when active defragmentation happens.
What we will end up with at the end of this cycle will have all the solidity 
and flexibility of the BSD VM with little of the complexity.  According to me 
anyway ;-)
