Why do you want to wait while 100 megs of data are being written?
You _have to_ have threaded db code in order to not waste
gobs of CPU time on UP + even with that you eat context switch
penalty anyway.
I hope you agree that threaded code is not ideal performance-wise
- async IO is better. O_DIRECT is strictly sync IO.
