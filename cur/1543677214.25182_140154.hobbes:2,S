This should have been obvious to me last week:
/sys/devices/pciN/busM/devQ/fnP/*
N is the thingy number. (domain, segment, hose...)
It's important to get the interface right, even if
that means a bit of short-term trouble. We'll be
stuck with the interface, like it or not, for a
damn long time once 2.6.xx gets established.
