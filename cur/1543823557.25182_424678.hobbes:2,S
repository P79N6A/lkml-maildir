Ah.. I see.  This is the ata_piix ghosting problem where signature of 
the first device is duplicated in the second device causing libata to 
probe the second non-existent device.

One of sata_via + ATAPI probing problem might have been fixed by this. 
It still needs to be investigated further though.

I think the correct solution would be fixing the ghosting problem of the 
controller.  I'll look into it.
