This doesn't have anything to do with realtime prioritization of a block
driver.  Anyway, I didn't go as far as looking at the claims, but from
the description on the web page it looks pretty feeble.  It seems to be
concerned with management of priority of softirq handlers to avoid
priority inversion, with a rather slipshod definition of priority
inversion given on the page.  I doubt RTAI has a lot to fear from this
patent, especially as the owner has hitched its cart to the Linux horse,
and likely realizes what a bad idea it is to apply cattle prods to said
horse.
