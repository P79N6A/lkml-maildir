Subject: ntfs support doesn't compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
ntfs support doesn't compile
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
On include/linux/fs.h the field "i_size" of "struct inode" has changed type
from "off_t" to "loff_t". As it is used in a division in line 838 of
"fs/ntfs/fs.c", the kernel linkage fails, complaining about the lack of
symbol "__divdi3".
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
filesystems ntfs
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.3.28 (root@obelix.inescn.pt) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #6 Tue Nov 16 20:00:13 WET 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)

-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)

[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
I worked around the problem by casting to "long" before the division.
To fix it would imply an implementation of "__divdi3" for the kernel.
It would also be nice to have "__udivdi3" implemented, as there is a
hack in "fs/ntfs/super.c", line 277, truncating an unsigned long long
to unsigned long in order to avoid a similar error.
