Uhh, how about this?
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule/2005-07_devfs.txt
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule/2005-12_raw_driver.txt
On the plus side, no rejects, and significantly more readable diffs. On
the minus side, it causes many more files in the source tree, though it
does make it easier to sort by whatever takes your fancy.  grep works
better too. :-D

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life."
