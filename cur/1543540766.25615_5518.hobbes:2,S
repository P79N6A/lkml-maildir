Subject: [PATCH] test6-pre kmod accounting bug

Linus,
2.4.0-test6-pre reintroduced an old process accounting bug in kmod.
The problem is that free_uid() now just drops the reference without
decrementing the #processes counter. This causes the user to be
debited for a process it didn't fork() itself.
The fix is to atomic_dec(&user->processes) before free_uid(user),
just like fork() does if it fails. Please apply the patch below.
