The idea for having ref count for sysfs_dirent was to keep the sysfs_dirents
around as long as there are live dentries corresponding to sysfs objects.
There can be open files (live dentries) but files getting removed. IMO,
without having ref count for sysfs_dirent, we could end up loosing the 
sysfs_dirent and end up in inconsistent sysfs_dirent tree with respect to
dentry tree. If we could maintain the consistency without refcounts then
it is good to reduce the size of sysfs_dirent structure.
Could you also test the patch like this, on an SMP box. Basically
opening/closing sysfs files and simultaneously inserting & removing dummy
module. This is just to make sure that we don't have any races 
particularly in dir and file operations. I will also test the patch tonight.
# while true; do find /sys/class/net/ | xargs cat; done
# while true; do insmod dummy.ko; rmmod dummy; done
# while true; do ls -lR /sys > /dev/null; done
Thanks
