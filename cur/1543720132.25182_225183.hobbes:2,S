I believe that I have seen something similiar, but possibly not identical.
When writing alot (I used /dev/urandom instead of /dev/zero), it looks
like a very large percentage of buffers that are being allocated during
writes are not being freed.  One test I did indicated that 95% of buffers
were not being freed!  I briefly mention some info in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/25/72,
 but I wasn't going to go into detail
until I'd found out more info, and verified that my test procedure was
adequate.
My test is pretty simple, print out the address every time a buffer is
allocated, and print out the address every time a buffer is freed.  In
this case there is only one location where it is being allocated, but 3
(4 with patch I submitted) where it is being freed.  It's simply a matter
of running a command like the one below, and looking to see which addresses
are in there an odd number of times (i.e. allocated, but not freed).  Not a
perfect test, but hopefully not embarrassingly bad either.
cat /var/log/messages | egrep 'Allocated|Freed' | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 7 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
I'm not sure why such a high percentage would not be freed, but hopefully I'll
figure it out in the next week or two, time permitting.
