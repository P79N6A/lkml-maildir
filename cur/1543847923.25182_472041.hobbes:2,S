The current code is:
        /* search for all Adatpec I2O RAID cards */
        while ((pDev = pci_get_device( PCI_DPT_VENDOR_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, pDev))) {
                if(pDev->device == PCI_DPT_DEVICE_ID ||
                   pDev->device == PCI_DPT_RAPTOR_DEVICE_ID){
                        if(adpt_install_hba(sht, pDev) ){
                                PERROR("Could not Init an I2O RAID device\n");
                                PERROR("Will not try to detect others.\n");
                                return hba_count-1;
                        }
                        pci_dev_get(pDev);
                }
        }
        if (pDev)
                pci_dev_put(pDev);
I don't see the point of the suggested place for the pci_dev_put()
since pci_dev_get() has never been executed in this case, or do I miss 
anything?
