Ok, I was looking at sockets and not tty's and that has the following in
net/core/sock.c
                   case F_SETOWN:
                        /*
                         * This is a little restrictive, but it's the only
                         * way to make sure that you can't send a sigurg to
                         * another process.
                         */
                        if (current->pgrp != -arg &&
                                current->pid != arg &&
                                !capable(CAP_KILL)) return(-EPERM);
                        sk->proc = arg;
                        return(0);
So it wouldn't work with socketpairs, but with tty's it should.
