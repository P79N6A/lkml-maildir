I was waiting for someone to ask that.  This is for an embedded device
that spends most of its time doing DMA.  Almost all of main memory is
allocated as an I/O buffer right after booting.  I don't actually need
high-order allocations, but since Linux supports it, I use it to reduce
the number of scatter/gather entries and associated overhead.  Works
great most of the time, except when I hit this bug.
