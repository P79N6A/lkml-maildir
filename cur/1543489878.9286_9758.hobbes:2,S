I meant mainly to keep the machine still usable in case of bugs, not to 
prevent any DoS.  It is only intended as a warning, not as a panic.
Also assume the case: block driver disables irqs for a long
time, message is printed, syslog is called, syslog does fsync, block driver
disables irqs again etc.
