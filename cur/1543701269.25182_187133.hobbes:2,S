[PATCH] I2C: sysfs interface documentation
1* No more current hysteresis value. I don't think we ever saw a chip
   which monitors current, and if we ever do, I would be very, very
   surprised if it would have an hysteresis value.
2* Temperature input and max can have 4 values. [from the previous
   patch]
3* Split temperature min and hysteresis into two separate files.
4* New file temp_crit. [from previous patch]
The new file temp_crit is subject to change later as we decide more
precisely how we want to handle values that are common to more than one
temperature channels.
