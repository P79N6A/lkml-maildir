I know that for scsi it can be fixed. Ok the current scsi layer doesn't do
it right, but there's nothing that prevents it in principle.
Eg
PCI code sees a PCI ID, calls probe for the chip
   chip driver looks and sees 2 "cables" and creates host structures for
   each.
   per host drive discovery is done and registered with a (thin) generic
   "I am a disk, gimme a major/minor" layer.
That ought to work. And on hotplug your probe just get called again...
