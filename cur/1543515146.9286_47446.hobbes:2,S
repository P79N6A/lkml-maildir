It looks like the ACPI implementation on your
system is broken.  It has an ACPI RSDP (root
system descriptor pointer) but no RSDT (root
system description table) which normally
points to all the really useful ACPI
information.
So, that message basically means that ACPI is
not going to work on your system for now.
There will be no ill effects but power
management with ACPI will just be turned off.
