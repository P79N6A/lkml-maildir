Hello,
For those of you who like your wings to rotate, we have added a new World Helicopter Operators section. This new section currently includes more than 500 international helicopter operators, covering air taxi, emergency services, offshore, agriculture, survey, heavy lift operations, etc.
You will find it at www.airlineupdate.com/data_pages/helos/helos.htm
Let us know if there are any errors or ommisions at: directory@airlineupdate.com
Kind regards
