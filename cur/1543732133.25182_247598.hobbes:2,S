  Yet again are we thinking in blocking ways. Firstly this was an
  example. Usually, though, most users accept the default icon for a
  file. If they do not they can still change the icon for the link
  they make on their start-menu/home folder/etc.

  I can make the same argument as for the icons.

  That would be a nice thing.
