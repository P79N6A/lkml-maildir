The problem is that rm does a chdir into a/b after unlink fails and tries 
to treat it like a directory. It's rather unclear why rm does that.
HFS allows to chdir into a file right now, because it doesn't has enough 
information to distinguish it from a lookup (for the resource fork).
OTOH it's easily fixable within rm, lstat clearly says it's a regular 
file, so rm has no reason to treat it like a dir.

I don't see what HFS should do different here, ext2 does the same. Can you 
send me the strace output to demonstrate the difference?
