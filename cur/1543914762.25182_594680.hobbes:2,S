It's different since _all_ network device drivers require networking 
support.

Different to CONFIG_SCSI, CONFIG_NET=n is so exotic that we should 
change it to no longer show users the question unless CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y.

If users who don't need it now enable CONFIG_SCSI (and drivers/ide/ 
usage is not that uncommon) that's a regression in the user interface.
If the lowlevel SCSI drivers move into a separate menu as your patch 
does, we simply no longer have any good reason for bothering the user 
with the CONFIG_SCSI.
