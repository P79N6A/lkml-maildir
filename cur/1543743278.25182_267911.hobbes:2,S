I'm going to test this. I thought that Gerd Knorr patch (which I sent cc'ing 
LKML and most of you) already solved this (I actually modified that one, 
replacing his SIGCONT kill()ing with a PTRACE_KILL, but I did this in the 
places he identified). I guess that old_pid should either already be dead 
there or going to die after a little, but I'm going to check (after I get UML 
to run in the current snapshot...)
For now, please hold on this.
