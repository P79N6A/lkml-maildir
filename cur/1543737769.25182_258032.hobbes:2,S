I'm not sure what you mean by "free-as-in-beer", but they were released 
open-source in hopes that others would be able to develop them further.  
At the very least, I know for sure that the sound card driver is 
open-source in hopes that people will be able to write an ALSA driver 
for it since it only supports OSS.  I'll have to check the licenses in 
the files I have for details about distribution.
