I've looked hard in the kernel and sound documentation and can't find
any hints about how to configure "sound-slot-0" and "sound-services-0-3"
Sound works if I add
    alias sound-slot-0 sb.o
to conf.modules.  But what about sound-services-0-3?
As an aside, none of the search engines seem to know what to do with
the hyphen character.  Searching on keys with hyphens produces the 
wrong results.
Suggestions?
