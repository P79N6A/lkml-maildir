Subject: [PATCH] mtrr compile fix when no procfs/devfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c does not compile when neither CONFIG_PROC_FS and
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS are set.  mtrr has interfaces that are defined when
either are set.
The problem is that both devfs_handle and struct mtrr_fops are declared
inside the section of code for these interfaces, but are referenced
outside of them.
Note that yes, the devfs code does not need to be explicitly ifdef'ed
since it is all defined as nops.  But then we would have to pull out the
devfs_handle typedef and mtrr_fops struct, which is just as pointless.
The attached is against 2.4.13-ac2.  Alan, please apply.
