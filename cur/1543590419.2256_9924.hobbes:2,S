Again, see my argument with Jens, if we make it 8k we risk triggering
lowlevel driver assumption about b_size being <= 4k. At least on my
alpha the fs has a 4k blocksize and I think I never tested myself using
a b_size of 8k yet and so I didn't wanted to put too many unknown
variables into the first equation ;).
