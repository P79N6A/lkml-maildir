Hmm, no idea. I think might have been some mix-up with merging the
patch. The one I saw was:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24/2.6.24-mm1/broken-out/slub-optional-fast-path-using-cmpxchg_local.patch
But I don't remember giving out a Reviewed-by for it (and my mailbox
confirms that). Furthermore, somehow it turned into this when merged:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1f84260c8ce3b1ce26d4c1d6dedc2f33a3a29c0c
In any case, if Torsten/someone can verify that reverting
1f84260c8ce3b1ce26d4c1d6dedc2f33a3a29c0c ("SLUB: Alternate fast paths
using cmpxchg_local") fixes these problems, I think we should just do
it and let Christoph sort it out when he gets back.
