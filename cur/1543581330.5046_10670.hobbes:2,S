Has been done.  Still needs some work, but it works pretty well.  As for
throttling io, having ios submitted does not have to correspond to them
being queued in the lower layers.  The main issue with async io is
limiting the amount of pinned memory for ios; if that's taken care of, I
don't think it matters how many ios are in flight.

Ah, but no.  In fact for some things, the wait queue extensions I'm using
will be more efficient as things like test_and_set_bit for obtaining a
lock gets executed without waking up a task.

There do exist plenty of cases where threads are not efficient enough.
Just the stack overhead alone with 8000 threads makes things really suck.
Event based io completion means that server processes don't need to have
the overhead of select/poll.  Add in NT style completion ports for waking
up the right number of worker threads off of the completion queue, and
That said, I don't expect all devices to support async io.  But given
support for files, raw and sockets all the important cases are covered.
The remainder can be supported via userspace helpers.
