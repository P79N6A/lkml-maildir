Well that is the tricky part.  The rest is simply finding which physical
addresses are valid.  Either by querying the memory controller or looking
at the range the BIOS gave us.
That part should not be too hard.  I think it simply has not been implemented
yet as most ECC chipsets implement this in hardware today.
