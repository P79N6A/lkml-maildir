I ran into this (2.6.13.3) on Friday as well, but I have not yet examined it 
in detail.
Do you have any pointers to the relevant postings or information?
I've used the 'mkinitrd' tool to generate a 'proper' initrd, and I see both 
mptbase and mptscsih loading, but mptscsih never picks up any actual 
controllers or disks. Thus the same problem on my system.
To me, this signifies that RHs mkinitrd is broken for this kernel, but I 
don't know the details of why yet.
Yours,
