The immediate need is that clock_gettime only returns microseconds scaled
to nanoseconds.

Right. I had it named getnstimeofday before but the feeling was that the
patch should not introduce a new name. Any approach that would allow
progress on the issue would be fine with me.

do_gettimeofday is used all over the linux kernel for a variety of
purposes and lots of code depends on the presence of a timeval struct.

That is what the changes to the time_interpolator do.
