Greg,
It doesn't happen with 2.4.21.
I've found an easy way to trigger this bug. I've used KPPP-Modem-Query Modem 
command, when it's querying the device I just unplug the device, then the 
kernel oopses.
I couldn't test with 2.5 yet, I've come to realise the touch-pad on my laptop 
doesn't work with 2.5.73, I'll let you know the result once I get it to work 
under 2.5.latest.
Thanks.
