I did read Hans' reply, but why should I believe him? When I was
skimming the csets on the bk site most of the changes looked like small
fixes or code migration stuff that touched all filesystems. And I don't even 
know what 'features' he's saying were added that he didn't sanction. I
obviously didn't read all of the log entries so it's definately possible
the big stuff he's talking about was completely missed by me, but I would
bet that his > 2/3 number is prett far off because every time I give
reiser3 a try something eventually goes wrong and I end up back on XFS or
ext3 because they're more reliable.
Jim.
