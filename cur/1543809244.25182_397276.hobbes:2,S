Only insofar as the kernel can not assume the device is still 
connected.  If the kernel sees that it is immediately reconnected and 
has every reason to believe that the 'disconnect' was only a result of 
momentary power loss, and it can probably continue to access the device 
with no consequences, then it should do so.

I suppose this is true.  Syncing before suspend will (mostly) keep the 
kernel from shooting the user in the foot.

But who cares?  There are plenty of really stupid things users can do to 
hose their system, it isn't right to prevent them from doing something 
perfectly reasonable just because it reduces the damage done when they 
do something completely unreasonable.

So because SCSI is more expensive than USB, it is ok to assume it will 
only be used by people who know what they are doing?  And since USB will 
be used by people who don't know what they are doing, we must assume 
they will always do silly things ( swap or modify the drive while 
suspended ), at the expense of those who don't?
