The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs.  The main change
here is that we dropped ->sync_page and rewritten ->writepage.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.24-rc1-521-g54866f0), as well as the backports to
2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2,
ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download backported unionfs code.
Please pull from the 'master' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ezk/unionfs.git
