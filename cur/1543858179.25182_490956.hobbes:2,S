I don't think that is possible.
There are a few "questions" that are quite fundamental when you want to
build a module that can be loaded by a given kernel.
About the most important fundamental "questions" i can think of ATM:
- UP/SMP
- Preempt yes/no
- RegParm yes/no
(x86)- High Memory off/4g/64G(IOW PAE yes/no)
And maybe a few more "not so fundamental" points.
AFAIK there is no way to build a module that would work in all of the
8/16 possible "kernel-types" you get with these 3/4 fundamental options
alone.
