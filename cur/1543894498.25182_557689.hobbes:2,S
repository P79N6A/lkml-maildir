I wasn't referring to anything that had already been "cleared up". I was 
applying the logic of the statement of yours I quoted. The "cleared up" 
things all were in reference to the GPLv3 - my example was in reference to 
the "spirit" of the GPLv2 that you were stating. By simple extension of the 
logic you provided I came to the conclusion stated above.
The fact that you've claimed I'm wrong shows how flawed your logic is.
