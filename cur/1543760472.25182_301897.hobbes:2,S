Well, according to your lspci, none of the bridges exposes a device with
AGP capabilities... It looks like you aren't exposing the host "self"
device on the bus. Do you have an AGP driver ? If yes, it certainly
can't use any of the generic code anyway ...
I still think that the matching between a bridge and a card should be a
bridge callback (with eventually a generic one that works for whatever
x86 are around) so that the bridge driver can deal with funky layouts. I
have no time to toy with this at the moment though ;)
