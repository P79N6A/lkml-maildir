On i386 the hw_irq_controller.end() handler
conditionally calls the function registered
for the hw_irq_controller.enable() handler
[enable_8259A_irq()] which I'd hazard is
how the missing hw_irq_controller.end() call
went unnoticed.  ie: for the i386 the end()
call was effectively redundant w/r/t the
enable() call.
However for PPC there is some specific
unfinished business to be done at the logical
conclusion of IRQ reception which is
accomplished by the registered end() hook.
