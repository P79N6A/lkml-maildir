If the capabilities are present we should use them.
It is _redundant_ and unnecessary to have seperate flags
for the existence of capabilities and the capabilities 
themselves.
In fact, I think that _all_ binaries should have capabilities
specified.  If a binary is not SUID and you try to run it
without sufficient caps/privs yourself you should get an appropriate
error and your prompt back.
One in, all in.

So we have a capability (to set capabilities) assigned to the UID.
WHAT did you think I have been talking about all this time?

The file owner cannot set any caps he does not possess anyway
so this is not a problem.

Right, but why should this just apply to root? I thought that we were
trying to do away with the need for root on a production system
here, and all of the ideas being presented still depend on
direct action by root for all changes in capabilities.
Am I the only one here who sees a problem with this?!

That would be, and is, an ugly hack.
It is also, I'll type this slowly, completely unnecessary!
Ownership of the file is stored in the filesystem.
If the filesystem says the binary is SUID-joe, then it may
not do anything that joe may not do were he logged in.
If joe tried to create a binary that could connect to port-23,
and joe did not have the privilege/capability to connect to port-23
himself, he should fail.
I like the idea of perhaps _managing_ caps through a sudo-type
program, but the caps and privs _must_ be inherent to each and
every user on the system or there is not much point to the whole
exercise.
