If you allow overcommit by the daemons and not user space then some of
the time you will still get out of memory kills which may well hit your
daemon process.

If you are running no overcommit you should never get an out of memory
kill.

I think that does what you need - you'd create containers for critical
services and for the users and split resources to protect one from the
other.
