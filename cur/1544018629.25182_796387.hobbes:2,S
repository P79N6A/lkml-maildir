Sorry to be blunt, but I don't think you read my message very carefully! 
I am reporting kernel bug(s) in the serial subsystem, not amateur 
configuration problems. I know what I'm about, but on a random selection 
of 3 servers with identical kernels/software, the serial subsystem works 
fully on none of them. All boot just fine to the normal console.
