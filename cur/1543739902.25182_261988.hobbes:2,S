Could be, not changed anything since 2.6.8.1 though and dmesg claims dma is 
enabled on hda, which is the only connected drive

That's still a lot of work, but thanks.. I'll probably just work through the 
bk snapshots until it breaks, then binary search on the remaining patches. 
It'll still take a couple of hours, especially on such a slow machine.

512MB, sorry about that..
By the way Jeff, I already said in my original post that copying from a local 
NFS mount gives me to get the full 10MB/s i.e.
NFS server X -> problem case machine's NFS mount -> some client machine = fine
problem case machine's local mount -> some client machine = slow.
My email was just an attempt to stir up any obvious changes that might've 
taken place. Since the problem seems obscure, I'll probably have to do it 
properly and manually search through the patches until I find the problem 
one.
Thanks for your prompt replies.
