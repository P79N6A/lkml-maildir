Obviously. Looking back through the report, him having SCSI CD-ROM support 
wasn't actually explicit so that might in fact be the problem but his 
self-compiled 2.6.20.15 worked and a 2.6.22 based Open SuSE Live CD does not 
(and he does have SCSI disk support, which suggests he will've likely also 
have thought of SCSI CD-ROM support) so it does not seem to be.
José: do you have SCSI CD-ROM support compiled in? What are the ATA/SCSI 
related messages in the output of "dmesg" when you compile with the 
CONFIG_ATA_PIIX driver, SCSI disk and SCSI CD-ROM support (and nothing from 
the old IDE menu)?
