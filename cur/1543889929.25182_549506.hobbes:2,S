Jeez, what argv[0] convention are you both talking about? argv[0] is not 
guaranteed to have any association with the name of the executable. Feel free 
to have any discussion about argv[0] you want, but *please* keep it away from 
AppArmor, which really has nothing to do with it.
It would be nice if you could stop calling argv[0] checks ``name-based access 
control'': from the point of view of the kernel no access control is 
involved, and even application-level argv[0] based access control makes no 
sense whatsoever.
Thanks,
Andreas
