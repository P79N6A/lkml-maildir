I've got a 64-bit cleanliness patch for SiS that I'd like to either get
someone else to review (preferable) or find time to re-read myself.  I
replace the memory management code that existed with much less code
(using bsd queue macros that I'm more familiar with).
Once the flames die down in X.Org I'll isolate the diff from my very
dirty local drm tree and post it again.
I'm hoping that most of the general DRM fixes will be replacing longs
with fixed-size types that are the same on x86, but I haven't looked at
Egbert's diffs yet, unfortunately.  As long as you don't use the linux-y
"u32"-type types, BSD should be happy with the changes.
