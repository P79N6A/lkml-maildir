I've been getting a warning in the dmesg of my laptop with every boot since I 
started using 2.6.24-rc7 that might be related.
This doesn't appear to cause any problems, but from looking at the source 
of the warning it appears that the ipw3945 hardware might be causing the 
problem.

The location of the warning is:
        hdrlen = ieee80211_get_hdrlen(rx.fc);
line in question -->        WARN_ON_ONCE(((unsigned long)(skb->data + hdrlen)) & 3);
        if (type == IEEE80211_FTYPE_DATA || type == IEEE80211_FTYPE_MGMT)
                local->dot11ReceivedFragmentCount++;
        sta = rx.sta = sta_info_get(local, hdr->addr2);
Now, the problem is that this might be nothing, and it might be the cause 
of the problem. (I don't think it is the cause, myself, because I've subjected
my laptop to a lot of activity - to the point that the card was starting to drop
packets - and have seen no problems)
