Please retry after re-exporting the filesystem using the highly
recommended "no_subtree_check" option. The default subtree_check option
is broken: it changes the filehandle of the file upon a cross-directory
rename() of that file.

'cos this is the only way to know that two files are the same. fileid is
not always supported by servers: it is an optional NFSv4 attribute, and
on NFSv3, most non-posix filesystems will fake it using something like
iunique().
Comparing filehandles allows you to be certain that two files are the
same if the filehandles are equal. If they are not equal, then that does
not guarantee that the files are different, but then how else are you
going to determine it?
