Michael:
Yes, I am aware of it.  I felt it was important to post user and kernel
so everyone knows that user and kernel development is done.  I have
talked with the OProfile maintainer about these patches already.  The
plan is to update the user patch with the correct kernel version, once
we know which version the patches will be going into.  
I should have mentioned this specifically in patch 0/3.  I will need a
final spin of the user tool patch once the kernel patches are accepted.
Thanks.
