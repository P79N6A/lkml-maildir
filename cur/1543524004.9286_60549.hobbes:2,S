Hi all,
    I recently started using 2.2.14.  I have a ncr53c810 SCSI card for
my scanner which worked in the past.  (read it has been a few moths
since I used it last) I don't ever remeber having to pass any parameters
to modprobe on the command line.  It seems now though I am getting an
EBUSY and I have no idea why.  Any ideas where I should start trouble
shooting this? insmod -f failed also.
[root@Lserver /root]# modprobe -a ncr53c8xx
/lib/modules/2.2.14/scsi/ncr53c8xx.o: init_module: Device or resource
busy
