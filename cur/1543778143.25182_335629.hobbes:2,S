...you might even need to turn memory over-commit off:
  echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
}
That's in 2.4. In 2.6 it's:
  echo "2" > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
But the kernel doesn't honor no-overcommit in either version, i.e. it still
overcommits/pages-out loaded/running procs, thus invoking OOM!
Is there a way to make the kernel strictly honor the no-overcommit request?
Thanks!
