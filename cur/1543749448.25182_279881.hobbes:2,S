It is there in the middle of the paragraph.  I moved it to the end of
the paragraph to make it easier to find in the future.

All fixed.

So the problem we have is that the chip does not have a unique id and we
are just having to rely on the id of the chipset that the lpc bus is on
therefore either chip (NSC or Atmel, etc.) could claim any of these ids.
Do you have a better suggestion so we can get away from maintaining this
list?  Also, in my latest version this table has been moved to the
header inorder to move to static initialization of the struct pci_driver
as Chris suggested.
