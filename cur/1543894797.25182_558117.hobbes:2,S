And it's your own, twisted interpretation. When I say "Sections" I 
mean "portions of the source code", ie: files, functions, etc... In that 
manner the person who wrote that function, file, etc... (provided it meets 
the "minimum of artistic expression" required by US copyright law) has 
copyright to it. If it doesn't become compiled into - ie: linked into as a 
*standard* part of the build - the final executable the license on the final 
executable *cannot* have any effect on the stated code. QED: a kernel module, 
like "i8042.ko" *can* and *does* have a separate copyright *and* license from 
the linux kernel itself.

I never said it couldn't - a license can do whatever the hell it wants. What I 
said was that the license on one copyright work *cannot* just magically 
change the license on another work. The change of license *requires* the 
person holding copyright to *agree* to the change of license.
And no, the GPL *DOES* *NOT* have the requirement that a non-GPL'd work 
included on the same medium - for distribution or otherwise - must change its 
license to the GPL. If you think otherwise then you are sadly mistaken.

About bison: doesn't matter. The code that they are included in *is* 
mechanically generated, as guided by the input file. QED: The output of Bison 
is a mechanical translation process *exactly* like the compiling of a C 
source file is a mechanical translation.

And the GPL cannot define, on its own, what a "Separate Work" or a "Coherent 
Whole" is. That is defined by the relevant parts of copyright law. QED: The 
passage is largely irrelevant - if not, then the FSF claim that linking to a 
GPL'd library means your program is "magically" now GPL'd. It would also mean 
that every Linux live-cd that includes a non-GPL program is violating the 
GPL.

Nope. To mean "source code files" or "functions in the source code". "Linker 
Sections" is your idea.

The confusion is probably because you assumed I was an idiot who didn't have a 
clue what he was talking about. "This" means, if you really don't 
understand, "combining a GPL'd work with code of your own". So, does creating 
a kernel module that needs to be loaded into memory *separately* from the 
kernel "combine GPL'd code with your own". If that's what you think then you 
are wrong - see my comments about "mechanical processes" and such.

Because the *only* relevant passages in the GPL, as applied to not-in-tree 
kernel modules is that about "derived works". *IF* distributing GPL'd 
binaries as part of an "Operating System" created a "collective work" then 
the FreeBSD people, who - last I looked - shipped with GCC as part of the OS, 
are in direct violation of the GPL. That means that either your argument is 
wrong or that every non-GPL'd OS that ships with GCC as an integral part is 
in violation of the GPL.

Hrm... I see your point. When applied *solely* to the kernel and associated 
modules. But I can *still* see problems with that interpretation - very big 
ones that a good lawyer could exploit.
