[ Considering this has sufficiently excited me, I became the second person
to illegitimately download 2.6.22-mm1 and am presently building Michal's
config. The strange thing is that I couldn't get 22-mm1 to even build with
the posted .config -- so had to deselect XFS, ATA, unionfs.
Hopefully this bug should be 100% reproducible at boot time anyway.
Don't care much for XFS and unionfs, but hoping deselecting ATA from
the config doesn't change the variables much in this equation. ]

What I'm surprised about is that %eax doesn't seem to contain the
return value `ret' of kobject_add(). It's 1, which is funny, given:
ret = kobject_add(&mk->kobj);
BUG_ON(ret < 0);
One wouldn't expect BUG() -- or the corresponding exception handler --
to clobber registers, that would be a sad day.

I'm building with this:
if (ret) {
        printk("~~~~~ .%s.%d.%s. ~~~~~\n", name, ret, kparam->name);
        return;
}
To also print out the evil kparam->name that caused us to crash.
When ret == EINVAL, name would be "", so not so helpful alone.
Also enabling netconsole, though I'm sure there's zero chances
of NET / ethXXX / netconsole being up _this_ early in the boot ...
Will keep you guys posted :-)
