Is 'Vermillion' the project codename, or the name that end users will actually
see when hardware ships?  Most of the Intel graphics chopsets have been
named things like i810, i925, and so on - if the user-visible name is known,
that should probably be reflected in the 'tristate' string and help
text (FB_VERMILLION in the code is fine by be though).
