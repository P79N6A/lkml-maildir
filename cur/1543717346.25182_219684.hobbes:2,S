I definitely didnt have sii3112 as a module. I get this happening very
very rarely. Still wonder if it might be the SiI3112 bug for which there
is a watchdog workaround - any idea if this is the case Jeff? It is
quite hard to repeat as it happened on a faulty disk and they tend to
remap sectors eventually...
