I am trying your test program(scalability) in house, but somehow i got
different result as you saw. i created 8 files each with 1G size on
separate drives( to avoid the latency disturbing of disk seek). I got
this number without applying the batch based on 2.6.26. May i ask how
to reproduce the mmap issue you mentioned?
8 CPU
read_worker
1 threads Real time: 101.058262 s (since task start)
2 threads Real time: 50.670456 s (since task start)
4 threads Real time: 25.904657 s (since task start)
8 threads Real time: 20.090677 s (since task start)

mmap_worker
1 threads Real time: 101.340662 s (since task start)
2 threads Real time: 51.484646 s (since task start)
4 threads Real time: 28.414534 s (since task start)
8 threads Real time: 21.785818 s (since task start)
