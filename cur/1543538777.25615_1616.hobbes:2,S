	Just to be a frick'n idiot, why not just have the kernel
issue messages to the kernel log when swap space becomes low,
(configurable via /proc), and have a user-land daemon monitor
for that, and Do The Right Thing(TM)?
	Would take a lot of the OOM cruft out of the kernel, and
would alloe pop-up messages, selectable kill-this-app dialogs,
AI systems, whatever. 
	Just say:
Jan 11, 2000: kernel: VM Warning: Swap space at %90
Jan 11, 2000: kernel: VM Warning: Swap space at %95
Jan 11, 2000: kernel: VM Warning: Swap space at %98
Jan 11, 2000: kernel: VM Fatal: Swap space exhausted!
