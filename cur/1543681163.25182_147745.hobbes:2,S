Subject: [PATCH]: Set SOCK_DONE when TCP socket receives FIN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/13/238

The SOCK_DONE flag is always clear and never set in 2.5.75.  Yet there
is code which tests it, and if it's clear, will return -ENOTCONN.
Admittedly I am confused as to how this is not noticed :)
This small patch sets it where it looks like it was intended.
Please check.
Enjoy,
