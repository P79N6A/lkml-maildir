This is no different from having to build a new kernel whenever you happen to install a new revision of a videocard, nic, scsi controller, or random other device new enough that its pci_id isn't in pci_ids.h.  New features and new devices frequently require new kernels.
Allowing specific commands while disallowing unknown commands to standard users is a far better scenario than any other proposals I've heard so far.
