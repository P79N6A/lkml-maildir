It does show the threads, but your "grep" missed them.
The built-in process selection and sorting features
are properly thread-aware.

-m  process followed by threads, Tru64 SysV style
m   process followed by threads, Tru64 BSD style
-T  grouped threads with TID column, Irix style
-L  grouped threads with LWP (and NLWP maybe), Solaris style
H   loose threads, FreeBSD style
I'll give you a few examples with a 2-thread process.
Note how the m option distinguishes signals that are
pending on a process from signals that are pending on
a thread. (some whitespace has been trimmed out too)
Also, the H option's PID column most likely should show
the thread ID instead; help with FreeBSD 5's thread
and MAC behavior would be appreciated.
