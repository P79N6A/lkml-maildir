Hello,
I noticed some cpu-usage bogus in 2.3.48. With one CPU in the system
and the kernel compiled UP, I got the following info from top:
CPU states: 154.8% user, 23.9% system,  0.0% nice, 829065.5% idle
I noticed it when WMFire started giving me 200% CPU usage from time to
time, 200% seems to be the top limit of CPU usage I can have :-)
However, the system can never be more than 100% idle.
Kind regards,
--Tim :-)
