Okay, here we go.  Earlier today, I erased several images from my local
working directory for a website.  I updated several other things and
then ran the following:
scp -r pics user@site:/home/trever/somewebsite/
speachbubbleLONG.jpg 100% |*****************************|  2868      
00:00
speachbubble.jpg     100% |*****************************|  3428

The speachbubble* were among the files I had erased about at least 15
minutes before hand (maybe over an hour).
This happened every time I used the command.  However when I changed
into the pics directory and ran:
scp  * user@site:/home/trever/somewebsite/pics/
It didn't copy those files, didn't even see them.  An ls doesn't show
them either.
I have seen this happen several times before, I just realized for once
it is indeed a bug and not me messing up or imagining things.
My filesystem is mounted as ordered mode w/ ext3.  Is this a known bug?
