Actually, in reading through the devfs documentation some more about the
"devfs=only" option, I think this patch should be accepted.  Just
because you have not fixed up some remaining drivers for the (to quote
you) "dedicated souls" who want to use this option.
Don't force such a large and intrusive API change into loads of drivers
that do not want anything to do with devfs, just because your feature is
not yet complete.
If nothing else, it would force you (or people who actually use
"devfs=only") to fix those remaining drivers, which I would expect you
to view as a good thing :)
