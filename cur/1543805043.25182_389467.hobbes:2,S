Hmmm, does that mean there is a fundamental conflict between the desire to 
share pte's and getting good cache coloring behavior?
Isn't it the case that if the region is large enough (say >> 2MB), that 
randomized mmaps will just cause the first partial page of pte's to not be 
shareable, and as soon as we have a full pte page mapped into the file that 
the full pte pages will be shareable, etc, until the last (partial) pte page 
is not shareable?
