So glibc should be linked to libnl that depends on glibc to compile? Be 
serious!
I see a worrying tendency of kernel developers trying to push their 
stable-api-is-nonsense approach to userspace. You cannot just go ahead and 
remove userspace API that has been exported for years in a six month period. 
99,9% of application developers are not even aware that 
feature-removal-schedule.txt exists. Sorry, these macros will have to stay 
for *years*, even though they are ugly.
Btw, do you know why I didn't realize the breakage before a user alerted me? I 
stopped testing and running every new kernel. Reason? It was stated that 
2.6.18 requires a mandatory upgrade of udev bloat. Last time I needed to 
compile a new udev because of incompatible sysfs changes, it took me over 
three hours to get my notebook running again. Considering that I need to do 
actual money earning work on that system, 2.6.17.x runs nicely and has no new 
bugs that concern me, I just keep using it. Collateral damage.
You know, I'm not so happy with the in kernel stable-api-is-nonsense approach 
because it does create insecurity for developers and therefore bugs. Anyway, 
I accept it, I'm just a part time kernel hacker. But behaving towards 
applications developers this way is *deadly* for linux acceptance! Stuff like 
KDE, or a postgres database server, or whatever is complex enough that 
developers don't have time to follow userspace breakage introduced just 
because of ugly macros.
