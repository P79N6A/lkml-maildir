If __wait_on_buffer and ___wait_on_page get stuck, this could
mean a page doesn't get unlocked.  When this is happening, we
may well be running into a dozens of pages which aren't getting
properly unlocked on IO completion.
This in turn would get the rest of the system stuck in the
pageout code path, eating CPU like crazy.
