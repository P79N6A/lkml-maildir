I do not recall the details at the moment but I recall I had to
do this tradeoff for some reasons.
I do not say it is not fixable but when I did the static-y support
I recall I took a shortcut or two under the assumption that everything
build by klibc was anyway so simple that compiling a bit too much was no harm.
Too buried with other stuff right now.
But feel free to poke me in roughly a month and I will take a deeper look.
