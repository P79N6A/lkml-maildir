This is a known issue that allegedly has nothing to do with the drive, and
everything to do with a bug in many ide controllers.  I have my 307030
running just fine in windows 2k with an intel i815 board.
I *think* the i8xx N/Sbridge chipsets all work fine with the drives.  Mine
do.  A quick search shows complaints with: BX, amd 751, kt 133a, highpoint
chipsets.
Does anyone know what this bug actually is, and whether there's a possible
workaround without disabling udma entirely?
