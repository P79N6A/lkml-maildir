Right now it is independent but I added a single line of code to the 
Radeon driver to init the card prior to initing the rest of the driver. 
It can be done earlier than that inside fbmem.c, but I wasn't sure how to 
set up the code so it would only POST each card as it is needed as I 
don't want to bring up secondary controllers unless the user actually 
wants this.
How does the framebuffer console system handle secondary controllers 
right now? It seems from my look at the code that it only brings up the 
primary and not the secondary?

Yep, you could use either. In fact you could even use the VGA text 
console driver on PowerPC and MIPS platforms provided the kernel 
correctly sets up the proper VGA resource mappings (which many embedded 
kernels do not do).
