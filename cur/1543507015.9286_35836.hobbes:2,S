Subject: Re: How does arp work with NAT?
!!! First I must correct myself: Of cource my firewall has two nics! In my
original post, it seemed it only had one. This is the correct nic config:
eth0    133.20.12.67
eth0:0    133.20.12.68
eth1    192.168.71.201

Hmm... isn't this the translating rule:
[root@fd_router /]# ip rule
<snip>
32025:  from 192.168.71.33 lookup main map-to 133.20.12.68
<snip>
What I (also) forgot to include in my original post:
[root@fd_router /]# ip route list table local
<snip>
nat 133.20.12.68 via 192.168.71.33 scope host
<snip>

No, I'm afraid I lost you here... But according to Matthew G. Marsh
<mgm@paktronix.com>, the arp request was correctly send with the nic's
primary address as source address.
