After doing a small amount of research into this, according to the abstract at
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/shell/paperF.pdf
 you can get O(n^(4/3)) 
with different increment sequences. (1, 8, 23, 77, 281 ...)
So I guess the sort function could look something like this for XFS use
(for reference only!):
void shellsort(void *array, size_t total_elems, size_t size, 
    int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *))
{
    size_t i, j;
    int k, h;
    register char *a = array;  
    const int incs[3] = {23, 8, 1};
    
    for (k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        for (h = incs[k], i = h; i < total_elems; i++) {
            j = i;
            while (j >= h && cmp(a + (j-h) * size, a + j * size) > 0) {
                swap(a + j * size, a + (j-h) * size);
                j -= h;
            }
        }
    }
}
