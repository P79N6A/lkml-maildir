At this point I'd quite like to see :
	mv nmi.c nmi_watchdog.c
and put all this stuff in always-compiled nmi.c.  traps.c is getting
bloated.

Now you're using RCU, it's a real pity that we have the inb() first -
if it wasn't for that, there would be no reason at all to have the "fast
path" setting code too (the latter code is ugly, which is one reason I
want to ditch it).
How about adding default_do_nmi as the minimal-priority handler, then
add the watchdog with higher priority above that ? Then oprofile can add
itself on top of those both and return NOTIFY_OK to indicate it should
break out of the loop. As a bonus, you lose the inb() for the watchdog
too.

I thought you agreed the stuff should be in asm/nmi.h ?
