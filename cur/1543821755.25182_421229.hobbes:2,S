I have seen a few similar postings on the kernel list. Occassionally -- 
like one time out of every 40 -- my machines with SATA OS drives stop 
booting early in the boot process.
The last messages on the boot screen are approximately:
ata1:  SATA MAX UDMA/133 .... irq 17
ata2:  SATA MAX UDMA/133 .... irq 17
ata1:  dev 0 ATA
ata1:  dev 0 configured for UDMA/133
scsi0: ata_piix
ata2:  SATA port has no device
scsi: ata_piix
    Vender:  ATA   Model:  Maxtor
    Type:  Direct Access
Scheduling while atomic: ksoftirqd/0/0x00000100/3
[<c02dd460>] schedule+0x990/0xd0b
[<01745d3>] dput+0xf4/0x20b
Then the boot stops.
I am running the 2.6.14.6 kernel.  Has this issue been fixed since then? 
Thanks in advance for the reply.
