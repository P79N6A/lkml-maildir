Fine. But, how about a call that the drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c::sleep_init()
can call to arch/i386/kernel/acpi/ to validate that it can do S3 from the 
beginning. That way, we're more certain of whether or not we're going to 
succeed or not. 
Doing this can also get rid of this crap, too:
int acpi_save_state_mem (void)
{
#if CONFIG_X86_PAE
        panic("S3 and PAE do not like each other for now.");
        return 1;
#endif

Correct.

I propose that we don't even call SUSPEND_DISABLE. Based on recent
conversations, it appears that we can and should do the entire device
suspend sequence in two passes - SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE with interrupts
enabled, and SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN with interrupts disabled.
