You didn't expect flamage? You seemed to claim that you were doing
an impartial summary of the argument, and seemed to expect that
everyone would just agree with you and shut up. That is not likely.

No, actually not. The existing SysV IPC API is used.

This is the first time a reasonable fear has been expressed.
There is nothing to worry about though. From the man page:
: normal Linux kernels are not affected by DIPC  programs,
: meaning that the there is no need to change and recompile these
: programs when they are to be executed in single computers with
: no DIPC support.
That is, you won't need to worry about DIPC.

One expectation is ease of software development. Your pocket organiser
is not programmed in assembly language.

Why must you dictate what other people do in userspace? The kernel
(not mediocre) supports plenty of mediocre userspace software.
Scripts are slow... shall be remove binfmt_script to fix that?
