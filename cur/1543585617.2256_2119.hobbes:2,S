Just out of interest, what information does the OOM score expose that isn't
already available to Joe Random Unprivileged User?  Looking at my 2.4.1
source, nothing.  The badness() function uses the following:
- memory size
- run time
- cpu time
- nice value
- if it's a root process
- (rare) if process has direct hardware access
Apart from the last item, which is rarely encountered, all the above info
is available using 'top' or 'ps' or via the /proc filesystem already, by
any unprivileged user (unless you've make /proc su-access only, in which
case your point is moot anyway).
