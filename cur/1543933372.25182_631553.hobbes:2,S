I'm not sure how this is 'new' breakage, because git-cpufreq hasn't changed
in a while, other than the integration of that missing #include diff
that sat in -mm.   Maybe some bad interaction with something else that
changed perhaps. *shrug*.
I'm on vacation until the new year, so I'm going out of my way not to look
at bugs for a change.  But I'm not ignoring this completely, I'll make a
note to look at it in January.
