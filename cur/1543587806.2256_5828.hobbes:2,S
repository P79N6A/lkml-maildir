Yes, that would be another acceptable solution. Situation where half
of power managment (UPS) is done with init and half with acpid is not
acceptable. [I doubt UPS users will want to switch. Why invent new
daemon when init is doing perfect job?]
However, I believe that simple way of sending signal to init is best
solution. It will suffice in 99% cases, users already know how to
configure init, and it does not need another process in userspace. In
remaining 1% case, init can simply notify acpid that even came.
I believe that one-patch is still worth applying. *Maybe* signal
should be changed to SIGUSR1 (to make room for SIGUSR2 to be sleep
button).
