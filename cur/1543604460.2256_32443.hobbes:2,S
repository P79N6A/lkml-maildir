Hi there,
I'm having problems with getting kernel 2.4.12 (and yesterday 2.4.11, but
that has bitten the dust now) to work on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 8000,
PIII-850, 512MB RAM).
I searched the lkml archive, and found the following post which describes
my problem exactly:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=99475318111175&w=2
Unfortunately nobody responded to it. I assume that something to do with
AF_NETLINK has been merged in from the -ac series since 2.4.8, as the
distributor supplied kernel (2.4.8-26mdk) works fine.
As the previous poster suggested, I have tried re-compiling with
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV, but that didn't help, and I am still getting:
  Cannot send dump request: Connection refused
Does anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Corin
