[PATCH] fork: fix race in setting child's pgrp and tty
In fork, child should recopy parent's pgrp/tty after it has tasklist_lock.
Otherwise following a setpgid() on the parent, *after* copy_signal(), the
child will own a stale pgrp (which may be reused); (eg. if copy_mm() 
sleeps a long while due to memory pressure). Similar issue for the tty.
