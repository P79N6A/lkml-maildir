Umm, question.  Since the iToaster doesn't use Linux at all, but only
uses BeOS, how would it be in violation of the GPL?  Maybe a minor
point, but wouldn't they have to use Linux GPL-ed code first, before
they could violate the GPL?  And since they haven't, doesn't that make
violating the GPL, umm, a little more difficult?
