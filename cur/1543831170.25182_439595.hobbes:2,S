The constant is unpleasant.
If we're going to abuse nl_pid then how about we design things so that
nl_pid is treated as two 16-bit words - one word is the start CPU and the
other word is the end cpu?
Or, if a 65536-CPU limit is too scary, make the bottom 8 bits of nl_pid be
the number of CPUS (ie: TASKSTATS_CPUS_PER_SET) and the top 24 bits is the
starting CPU.  
<avoids mentioning nl_pad>
It'd be better to use a cpumask, of course..
