There is already such a project under development: see
http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/bp/main.html
This is a modification to gcc that implements pointers as triples.
While there is a performance penalty for doing this, it can completely
eliminate the problem of exploitable buffer overflows.  However, programs
that violate the rules of ISO C by generating out-of-range pointers will
fail.
