It's BREAKPOINT() everywhere:
$ grep BREAKPOINT include/asm-*/kgdb.h
include/asm-i386/kgdb.h:#define BREAKPOINT() asm("   int $3");
include/asm-ppc/kgdb.h:#define BREAKPOINT()             asm(".long 0x7d821008") /* twge r2, r2 */
include/asm-x86_64/kgdb.h:#define BREAKPOINT() asm("   int $3");

The simple answer is you don't call BREAKPOINT() in your code anywhere.
You call breakpoint() or kgdb_schedule_breakpoint().
The split here is different in that <linux/kgdb.h> should be standalone
(it's not, _yet_).
But this is all an aside to my question. :)
