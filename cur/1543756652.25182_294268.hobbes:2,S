Laptops are a little different as they will make calls from the Video 
BIOS into the system BIOS, so you need to make sure that the system BIOS 
is also available in the execution environment. So if you are using an 
x86 emulator, you need to make sure the system BIOS is mapped into the 
emulator image and that any necessary resources it might need are available.
