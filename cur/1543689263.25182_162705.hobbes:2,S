Thanks for your interest and feedback.

No, it is the intent of the project to have all four controllers cpu, memory,
io and network to be usable simultaneously.
However, the supplied patches for each controller only assume the core patch
(ckcore) to have been applied. We'll try to provide rollups of all controllers
combined on the ckrm site once the combinations get tested (if you do that, please let us
know !)

Thanks. I'll add it to the next version.
