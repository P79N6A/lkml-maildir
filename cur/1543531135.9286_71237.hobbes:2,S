   The system _is_ the bug. Please tell me what is wrong with allocating a
piece of memory and using it? Nothing, of course. Yet Linux will currently
nuke the process (or another completely unrelated process) for doing that.

   It does not. Disabling overcommit means that when a process can't get
memory, it is told that it can't get memory.

   Power failures, system crashes, etc. is not the issue. You're claiming
that the kernel can have a good reason to kill that program. Please
explain. Trust me, neither the user nor the programmer will agree with you.
They have standards documents to back them up.

   Touching the allocated pages does not help even the slightest bit. Take
Rik's OOM patch as an example. Your process can touch its memory as much as
it wants, but it will not protect it from Rik's OOM killer.
