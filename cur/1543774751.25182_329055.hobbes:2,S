Sorry, would you please explain what is wrong in having the below
if (inode->i_nlink != 0 || atomic_read(&inode->i_count) > 1)
in reiser4_put_inode.

We were trying to avoid need to have reiser4_drop_inode because you said
drop_inode is a hack for hugetlbfs.
The problem is that on file removal reiser4 wants to do
truncate_inode_pages in reiser4_delete_inode. We used reiser4_drop_inode
for that. As long as drop_inode was about to die, we decided to do file
predeletion in reiser4_put_inode when inode is about to get into
iput_final with inode->i_nlink == 0.
It is a pity that put_inode is also wrong abstraction.

You said:
--------
So what you want is actually to move the  truncate_inode_pages out of
generic_delete_inode and into ->delete_inode?
Looking at the code another strategt makes more sense:
 - move the truncate_inode_pages at the beginning of clear_inode.
   All callers but one already do it just before that call, but
   the one that doesn't will require a full audit of all ->delete_inode
   instances
 - make the first half of clear_inode into a helper (__clear_inode or
   whatever), and make ->clear_inode responsible for calling it as first
   thing for a normal fs or call it in clear_inode if ->clear_inode
doesn't
   exist.  that way we can also move the invalidate_inode_buffers out
there
   easily later for filesystems that don't use buffer_heads at all.
p.s. please try to keep -fsdevel Cc'ed on the mail related to core
changes
-------
I hoped that we can solve the problem internally in reiser4. If
put_inode is about to be removed we will have to do ssomething like
that.
