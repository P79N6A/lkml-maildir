But DMA? You are talking about what amounts to a sound card driver.
And since in the cases that burn cpu time you have to process raw
sound samples into modem data, you need to shift a fair amount of
data. inb and outb just don't have the bandwidth.  So you need a
kernel side component that drives the hardware to some extent.
Additionally you still don't need a FUSD driver for that case.  All
you need is to have is a ptty.  Because that is what modem drivers
are now.  And the ptty route has binary and source compatiblity
to multiple unix platforms.
