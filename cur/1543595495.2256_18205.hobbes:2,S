I must thank the god fair Eunice. ;-) From a programming standpoint, this 
looks like a really nice approach. I must say I prefer this approach to the 
various "event" strategies I've seen to date, as it fixes the primary 
problem with signals, while still allowing us to hook in to all the 
standard POSIX API's that already use signals. It'd be nice if I could pass 
in a 0 for signum and have the kernel select from unused signals (problem 
being that "unused" is not necessarily easy to define), althouh I guess an 
inefficient version of this could be handled in userland.
I presume the fd could be shared between threads and otherwise behave like 
a normal fd, which would be sooooper nice.
I guess the main thing I'm thinking is this could require some significant 
changes to the way the kernel behaves. Still, it's worth taking a "try it 
and see approach". If anyone else thinks this is a good idea I may hack 
together a sample patch and give it a whirl.
Thanks again good fairy Dan/Eunice. ;-)
