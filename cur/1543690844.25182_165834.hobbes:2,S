I haven't collected too many numbers, but the few I did collect show
-O2 code actually being faster than -Os, as long as you stay in
userspace and the code is small and loopy.  It may get worse for large
run-once code, but I don't have numbers for that.
My explanation for Alans results is that nature of kernel code.
Usually, kernel code execution takes only a fraction of the cpu time,
so the user code run in between effectively flushes the cache.  Each
system call causes near 100% cache misses, so smaller code is almost
always faster.
So even if your observations were wrong and gcc would create perfect
code for both -O2 and -Os, I wouldn't expect -O2 to be faster for
kernel code.
