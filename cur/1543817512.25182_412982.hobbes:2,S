You're making a connection where no such connection exists.  Devices
are only part of the platform bus if they explicitly want to be (in
much the same way that devices are only part of the PCI bus if they
explicitly set dev->bus to be the PCI bus.)

From what I can see, the embedded device does not belong to any bus at
all since dev->bus is NULL.  Hence, I don't think it's the embedded
struct device which is causing the problem here.
It would be good to see the entire oops to see what's going on.
