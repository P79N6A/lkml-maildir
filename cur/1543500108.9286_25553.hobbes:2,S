I pretty much understand how ipchains works (for what I use it for) but I
have yet to understand what all these other policies are.  (like the input
policy, this one I understand, but not user added ones).
One thing I'd like to do (and I don't know how to go about doing it) is have
a port (say 23) redirected to another port (say 10023) on one interface, but
not another (That I can figure out -i eth1 =).  I'm trying to do this on a
fire wall machine so I can have ssl telnetd running on port 10023 (which
requires encryption).  When someone on eth0 (not connected to the internet
in anyway) telnets, they connecto to port 23 (real port), when someone on
eth1 (internet) connects to port 23, it will really connect them to 10023
and require encryption.
This is not a security question, this is a howto question.
If you suggest ipportfw, you will have to give me an example and if it
doesn't use ipchains, where to get the program to do this.
