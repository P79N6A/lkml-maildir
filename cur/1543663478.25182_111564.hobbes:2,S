Yes, except for the same concerns I had about your patch moving it.
That part could be cleanly solvged by just moving a lot of the tear-down
of the "struct task_struct" entirely into "__put_task_struct()" (which now
can never be called with "current == tsk"), ie if we do the "free_user()"
_there_, then I think we can remove the wait_task_inactive() entirely from 
the wait path.
