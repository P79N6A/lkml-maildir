Subject: [BUG][2.5.63] New IDE changes cause data corruption on PIIX4 AND additional problems

Booting 2.5.63 I ran into several problems:
1. With full kernel debugging on, sleeping contexts loop forever, Adam Belay 
has a fix that worked for me - Still testing
2. When booting over serial console if i get a buffer overrun error, I loose 
total access to the machine. I can't ssh in or use direct console. This did 
not happen in .62.
3. Data corruption with PIIX4:  While vi'ing /etc/lilo.conf exiting, then 
vi'ing /etc/inittab saving a change. I ran init q. The moment I ran it i got 
a strange panic from bash and a *__timers function. When I rebooted inittab 
was corrupt and oddly /etc/inittab became lilo.conf! (it had the same 
contents, acrossed inode somehow?).
/me looks at Alan with evil eyes IDE was working so well ;-(
