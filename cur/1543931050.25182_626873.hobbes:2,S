Hi Ingo,
I am able to reproduce the oops here on my system with 2.6.22.14 +
CFS backport. I am not able to reproduce it with 2.6.22.13 + CFS
backport. I believe the CFS backport is just exposing the bug. Can't
find an obvious culprit and am looking into this issue.
Vincent, could you please confirm if you are able to reproduce this with
2.6.22.13 + CFS?
Thanks,
