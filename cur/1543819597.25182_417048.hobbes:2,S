Greg,
I think what really tripped him up was the response to his attempt
to get the new hooks introduced:  tinyurl.com/opo8h
Jan,
I think that the last response, by Chrisw, in that thread, was not
a snide comment, but a legitimate request for a justification for
the hooks.  If they are a crucial part of your module, then i assume
they should be pretty easy for you to defend, right?
I think it would be worth trying again.
