I think that necessary condition to have a reordering of bus sent
invalidations is to have a partitioned cache architecture.
I don't see any valid reason for a cache controller of a linear cache
architecture to reorder an invalidation stream coming from a single cpu.
If the invalidation sequence for cpu1 ( in a linear cache architecture )
is 1a, 1b, 1c, ... this case can happen :
1a, 2a, 1b, 2b, 2c, 1c, ...
|       |           |
.........................
but not this :
1a, 2a, 2b, 1c, 2c, 1b, ...
|           |       |

Uhmm, an architecture that with  a = *p;  schedule the load of  *p  before
the load of  p  sounds screwy to me.
The problem is that even if cpu1 schedule the load of  p  before the
load of  *p  and cpu2 does  a = 1; wmb(); p = &a; , it could happen that
even if from cpu2 the invalidation stream exit in order, cpu1 could see
the value of  p  before the value of  *p  due a reordering done by the
cache controller delivering the stream to cpu1.
