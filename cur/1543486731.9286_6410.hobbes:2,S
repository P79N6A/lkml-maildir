But starting from empty files will cause the clients which were already 
connected when the server was rebooted to fail with "stale NFS file handle"s.
Unfortunately, you have to do this at the moment. 
However, the main reason for this seems to be that the kernel can only handle 
export entries for a single host, and if you export to a subnet, then kmountd 
has to add explicit entries for each host when it first tries to mount the 
filesystem. A possible fix might be to teach the kernel-side code about 
wildcard exports, which would fix both problems.

 s/performance/locking/ surely?
