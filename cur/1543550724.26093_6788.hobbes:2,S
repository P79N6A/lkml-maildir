Be advised that the big IDE patch for 2.2 (at least as of a month ago)
contains a backport of the 2.4 ide-tape driver. That driver is BROKEN --
if the last data written doesn't make up a full block, then the driver
won't be able to read back ANY part of the last block.
The current 2.2.17 ide-tape driver gets this right (you get the data
padded with zeroes to a full block).
I reported this to LKML and the ide-tape maintainer a month ago, but
he hasn't replied so I can only assume he's off-line or doesn't care.
