It could be the occasionall ordered tag that is sent to the drive to
prevent tag starvation.  If you search in drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_linux.c
for "OTAG_THRESH" and make that if test always fail (add an "&& 0") you will
have effectively disabled this feature.  I should probably make it an option
that defaults to off.
