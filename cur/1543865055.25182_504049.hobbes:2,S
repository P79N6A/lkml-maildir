Subject: [PATCH -mm] gtod persistent clock resume fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The reworked highres/dyntick code made a thinko in the resume code
visible, which was magically working in the old queue.
On resume we add the slept time to xtime. This delta must be adjusted in
wall_to_monotonic as well. The update of jiffies64 is bogus and a
leftover of the code which was taken from arch/i386/kernel/time.c.
On suspend the current state of xtime, wall_to_monotonic and jiffies is
frozen. After resume we need to add the slept time to xtime, but we need
to subtract it from wall_to_monotonic, so the monotonic time is resuming
from exactly the point where it was suspended. jiffies are restarting
from the same point as well.
This solves the resume waittime observed by Karsten Wiese.
