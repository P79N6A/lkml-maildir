The kernel checks for #!<path>, and that <path> is an existing
executable. If not, execve fails.

The problem with the binfmt_misc approach is that you need *another*
execve call: with binfmt_misc, you register <utf8sig>#!, and a
generic binary. Then, this generic binary will interpret the #!
signature *again*, and invoke the proper interpreter. This will
intepret the first line *yet again* (finding that it is a comment),
and continue processing the file.
However, this is not the real problem. The real problem is that
the specific binfmt_misc "backend" would not be universally
available, and then the same script would start on some systems,
and break on others. This may be acceptable for large or specific
applications (e.g. you have to setup the ibcs2 module to run
SCO applications); it is not for scripts.
Now, the "universally available" part would not apply right now,
as only the most recent kernels would provide the feature. However,
within a few years, the feature would be part of "Linux" - then
people can start using it extensively.

The point is that it is not necessarily the shell which starts
programs - the shell is but one creator of new processes. It is
very common today that, say, httpd starts new programs - this
mechanism is called CGI. Your approach was in use until 1985 or
so, when Unix implementations started to support #! natively.
This was done both for convenience and for performance: if
programs would always use system(3) to start new processes,
there would always be a shell that execs the eventual
interpreter.
I'm not sure, but I believe that most current shells have "forgotten"
how to do the #! magic, since, by now, "traditionally" this is
a kernel responsibility.
