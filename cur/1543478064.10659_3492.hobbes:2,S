During the week I compiled 2.2.0-pre6 to give it a try. It works well
except for one problem, I can't use PPP on the machine. I have an internal
modem on /dev/ttyS1. In both of the pre's I've tried, I get this error:
Jan 12 19:08:50 yinyang pppd[95]: Failed to open /dev/modem: Device or
resource busy(16)
Jan 12 19:08:50 yinyang pppd[95]: This system lacks kernel support for
PPP.  This could be because the PPP kernel module is not loaded, or
because the kernel is not configured for PPP.  See the README.linux file
in the ppp-2.3.5 distribution.
I have PPP compiled in. And the machine works perfectly under 2.0.36.
/dev/modem is a symlink to /dev/ttyS1. I also tried /dev/cua1. Both
devices report: Device or resource busy. I ran "fuser -v /dev/ttyS1" and
it reported nothing. I got no reports on /dev/modem or /dev/cua1 either.
I have read the README.linux, I also looked through the Changes file. I
have ppp-2.3.5 installed, and all the other packages upgraded. I tried
getting help from several people on #LinPeople, but that didn't fix my
problem. Any ideas?
