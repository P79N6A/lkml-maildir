But slave_attach isn't called here (even though it should be for attached 
devices).  I assume it's getting added by the scan between register_host & 
register_device.

OK, we have a slight mess up here.  Perhaps the rule for slave_attach should 
be that we only call it if we actually have an upper level device attached (if 
we haven't, there's little point asking the HBA to allocate space for queueing 
for a device we're not currently using).  Then, we should do slave_attach when 
something actually decides to attach to the device.
if we follow this approach, slave_attach wouldn't be called until 
register_device in your problem scenario, and then everything would work as 
expected.

Well, if there's no device attached, there's no need for a queue.  This would 
waste 1 SCSI command per unattached device (and SCSI commands are DMA'able 
memory which is precious on some systems).  Right now, that's OK for small 
systems.  When we move to a lazy attachment model because we have an array 
with 65535 LUNs and we're only interested in one of them, it won't be.

Well, to my way of thinking, build and release commandblocks are like 
constructor and destructor for the device queue.  On general design 
principles, I don't like the idea of queue specific information persisting 
past its destruction.
