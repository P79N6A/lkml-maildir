Yeah.  Except Dell will undoubtedly have them in desktops
within 2 years, and tons of people (myself included) still use
32-bit (K)Ubuntu on our systems, simply for the better binary 
compatibility that it is perceived to give with things like
browser plugins and stuff.
Using sysfs interfaces might be a good alternative,
if they were easier to use, but drives are not directly
accessible there using the dev_t value from stat(2).
Instead, software has to search everything inside /sys/block/
looking for a "dev" file whose contents match,
rather than just trying to access something like this:
   /sys/block/8:1/start
or
   /sys/block/majors/8/minors/1/start
Or any one of a number of similar ways to arrange it.
