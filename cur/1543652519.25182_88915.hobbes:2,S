We do not have a GeForce4 card in there, but we do indeed have an AGP
card in there.  It is a S3 ViRGE.
I will try disabling the AGP and see what happens.
I will say, though, that the stuck processes we have seen appear to be
doing disk I/O in the /home partition (which is disk mirrored with the
PDC driver), and apart from that, it seemed to be quite stable.  If a 
"crash" or a "hang" is described as getting a stuck process in disk I/O
because of some freak accident that getting an inode pointer can be
invalid, then yes, otherwise, no.

We do have a cooler master on the CPU fitted on with enough paste.  I thought
was the heat too, so we took it out of the server cabinet and let it stand
in the open.  Unfortuantely, we got stuck processes in disk I/O after 
a while as well.  Actually, even in the server cabinet, it is not that
hot.

I see.
I will call Gigabyte to see what are the odds of getting it fixed.  But
surely, if it was a hardware problem, others would have experienced
similar issues too (processes stuck in disk I/O uninterruptible sleep)?
I did search before, and don't recall finding similar issues.
