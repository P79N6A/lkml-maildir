So use the right option for that - umask=111 and there you go.
noexec doesn't (and shouldn't) do anything about mode.  Yes, VFAT (along
with explicit mechanism for doing what you want to do) used to have a
bug in noexec handling.  And that's a bug - plain and simple.  Try it
on any other UNIX _or_ other filesystem on Linux.
-o noexec means "execve() fails regardless of file permissions".  If you
want "give all regular files rw-rw-rw-" - VFAT has option for that:
umask.
