Sorry for the delay, but I could not do further tests before now. I have
now at least managed to get 2.6.6 to boot on the box (although it breaks
the synaptics mouse pad driver, but that's a different matter; this too
seems to be ACPI-related, though). The boot problem was the new cpufreq
detection mode producing a seg'fault during boot (and guess what: ACPI
again).
So far I can confirm the following: 1) the problem still exists in 2.6.6
and 2) the problem can be switched on and off be (un)loading the
'processor' module. Test environment is still Debian-unstable, this time
with 2.6.6 vanilla kernel in Debian distro config (a.k.a. pretty bloated
but most things as modules).
I do not expect different results when disabling processor support
during kernel compile. Of course I can try this, if wanted. Any patch
suggestions to try out so far?
Regards,
Robert
