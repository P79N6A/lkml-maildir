ok, 
Begging by answer the question, Daniel Drake, clearly, say:
"Nobody really has a full understanding of the problem and the
issues ...". 
As I can understand, make a sort of blacklist with IDs of the
problematic VIAs, which probably will always miss some IDs, but the main
problem is in lasts lines of this email. The way how is design the list,
could be one excellent idea, inclusive for other situations on VIAs, I
don't put this in question. 
After reviewing what I had write about this, the changelog: 
(please correct me the English and cut some parts) 
Well, a good new, I already have my old laptop again which have the most
problematic VIA (PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686). At the time I bought it, I
had problematic stuffs when kernel was trying enable APIC, on this
laptop, was one Local APIC, later we had the boot option nolapic to
workaround this. So the VIA works very well without lapic enabled.
Someone give to this problem a name of "the APIC victims", happened on
VIAs, Nvidias and probably on others boards. 
But this laptop need the quirks; nobody have put this in question,
VIA_82C686 has been always on list of the quirks. And btw, is important,
_need_ ACPI, with acpi=off, 1/2 of the computer: power manager and
hot-key, don't work at all. 
A few of the story about my laptop 
http://sergiomb.no-ip.org/laptop/
So, a few month ago, I bought, what I bought, one VIA of course :) with
this IDs: PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_1 and _2.
With this new VIA, I have exactly, the opposite problem, I found, on
this VIA with IO-APIC working well, that quirks aren't good/needed .
After, I found this interesting email 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/13/30
by Karsten Wiese, after, Alan Cox writes this
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/16/160
 (on same thread) and Karsten Wiese
end ups with the solution on 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/18/92,
 which I
want try to implement and that's it, come this idea, that may the full
understanding the problem.  
Conclusion, I have 2 VIAs with almost same IDs (others reporters have
with exactly the same IDs) and in ones I need the quirks and in others
don't, why ? one don't have apics enabled, the other have it !?!
Thanks,
