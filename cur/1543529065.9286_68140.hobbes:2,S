I couldnt quite follow the whole message, but in understanding your
statement "linking is linking, static or dynamic makes no difference"
I am concerned that one may take this one step further and say making a
system call is in a way linking with the kernel (after all, linking is
making a function call) and since the kernel is under GPL, so is my program.
Does this make any sense?
Thank you,
Lee

Linking is linking.  Statically or dynamically makes no difference
legally, it's only a technical issue.
It is however required that it is possible to link the binary to a
locally modified version of the used library.  With shared libraries
this is relatively simple, with static linking the binary distribution
has to contain separate object files for the library and the
application (additionally to the linked executable) so that it can be
relinked to a different library version.
IANAL, but you can look it up in section 6 of the LGPL for yourself.
