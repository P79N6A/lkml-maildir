In that case, you won't need a loader, I see; it should be however
a very easy job; just modify your architecture specific
arch/(arch)/setup.* file, (for mips, this should be arch/mips/setup.c), 
and modify it as you like for setting initrd_start/initrd_end.

Well, I don't know, noone tells me about projects like that :) On the
other hand, a boot-loaderless Linux is really only useful for the people
who assembled the hardware, and the information is not "out there".
Maybe you should put up a web page describing what have you did for
others to learn? :)
