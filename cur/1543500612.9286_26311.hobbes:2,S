AFAICT, the culture was definitely there. And I certainly don't know about  
any serious missing information. And it was definitely Uniy-like.
In fact, back when I was running OS/2, I had ext2 access from OS/2. Plus  
*two* different gcc ports. Plus a real GNU tar able to work with my SCSI  
tape drive, and all manner of other Unix-like utilities. Not to mention  
loads of OS/2-specific utilities.
IBM killed it.
They had a PowerPC port that they never marketed at all - I'm told you  
could buy it if you somehow manages to get the product number from  
somewhere. Their marketing was rather infantile, and got only cheaper.  
They delivered hardware and software with better NT than OS/2 support.
Now if it had been Open Source, it might have survived this.

*IF* M$ decided to port Win32 to some Unix platform (that is, something  
supporting most of the Single Unix spec, not some lame excuse like the NT  
POSIX subsystem), *then* they might get a real hold in the server market.  
As is, they seem to even have trouble selling NT to their desktop  
customers, which is why they have decided to do another installment of the  
95/98 saga after all. Hey, customers WANT unstable-as-hell MS-DOS based  
don't-look-at-it-wrong-or-it-crashes solutions!
