Well, it's your decision how you think you'd best manage your changes.
It's just an observation that bfin toolchains are a parrallel universe
for community people being used to the "mainline + reviewable patch
sets" paradigm (no, the svn is not reviewable, as it is not regularly
rebased against upstream).

No need to continue this discussion here. I'll come back with real
questions when re-testing u2 with your "official" toolchains.

That's all I wanted to hear. As long as you are heading towards getting
the code into gcc.gnu.org, I don't care any more.

Well, chip vendors are usually not that much of a constant as people
from the industry might wish. Strategies change, products are
discontinued, focus changes, companies are sold etc. For industrial
users who go the open source way because of long term product
strategies, having control over the source is pretty important. And
experience shows that once you have problems, the community is a much
better source of help than vendors.

Thanks for clarification. Regarding the original post, it justifies my
assumption that blackfin is currently not supported by upstream gcc.
