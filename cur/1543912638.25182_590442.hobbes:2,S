Actually, I think just fine-tuning it a bit may be better:
1. make 'nosharecache' as default
2. apply the algorithm in this patch to 'nosharecache': if the fsid and
mount options are the same, then share cache
This way the default behavior does not change, but both algorithms have
pitfalls, and we choose from:
1. if user specifies "sharecache", he may end up with nosharecache if mount
options are different
And
2. if user specifies "nosharecache", he may end up with sharecache if mount
options are the same
I'd think 2 is better (least surprise). I cannot think of a case where 2 is
actually a bad thing.
Comments?
