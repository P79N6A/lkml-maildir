There are two uses BKL in the ioctl call path:
1. BKL is kept across the whole ioctl call
2. BKL is used to protect the compat hash lookup
So ioctl_native is to let drivers declare they dont need the BKL
in they ioctl.
ioctl_compat is to let drivers declare 
they dont need the hash lookup so it can be replaced by direct call by pointer.
