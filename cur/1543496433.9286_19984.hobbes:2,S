I vote for the patch's inclusion in the mainline kernel sources.
I haven't examined this particular version of the patch, but I have
used variants since 2.0.32, in intel and alpha.
It's a configure option (default off) so should cost nothing, and
helps those of us who must deal with certain pathological devices.
