If it hadn't been for Andrew sending me a copy this mail would have gone
straight to /dev/null. Please ensure that you label NFS-related mails
with a clear "NFS" in the subject header if you want me to notice them.
Nobody has enough free time on their hands to spend reading all 1000
LKML emails each day.
Mind sending me a binary tcpdump of that readdir? Please use something
like
  tcpdump -s 9000 -w dump.out port 2049 and host insert_name_of_server
Cheers,
  Trond
