Subject: [PATCH] memory hotplug for ia64 (linux-2.6.7) [0/2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I updated the memory hotplug patch for an IPF NUMA machines which
posted in April.
The patch is against linux 2.6.7 and works with memory hotplug patch
which Takahashi-san posted on July 14.
Known issues(under investigation):
- remap function may be unable to mmigrate all pages.
- unplug-node function may fail, if page size is other than 4K byte.
- kswapd doesn't terminate when a node is unplugged.
How to apply:
 1) First of all, apply patches which Takahashi-san posted on July 14
    without [15-16/16].
    *If patches of [15-16/16] are applied, compile error will occur
     on ia64.
 2) Apply this set of patches.
Thank you,
Fumihiro Terasawa.
