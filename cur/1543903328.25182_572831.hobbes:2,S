The problem with the current "merging" is that it's extremely hard to 
figure out whether some code in x86_64 might be using some code in i386 
since there are currently 5 (five) different mechanisms used for sharing 
code between the two architectures.
It happens so often that someone accidentally breaks one architecture 
because he didn't notice the code also gets used on the other 
architecture.
