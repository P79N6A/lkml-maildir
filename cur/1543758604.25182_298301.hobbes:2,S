half-duplex will run near line speed in one direction.  Try sending in
both directions at the same time and you'll get closer to 40% of the
link utilization...  Also, if you see any collisions you are in half-duplex
mode.
You could try connecting the NICs back-to-back with a cross-over
cable to take your switch out of the loop?
