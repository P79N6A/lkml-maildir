A specific limitation of ACPI LEDs shouldn't constrain the interface and
spoil things for everything that can support generic triggers.

So we need to find a way of providing this functionality, maybe by
allowing leds to provide their own specific triggers. Thinking about
this limitation, I think it can be handled by the trigger
implementation.

It wouldn't do that be default but I see no reason to constrain any
interface to stop this. The kernel isn't supposed to set policy (or in
my view put unnecessary constraints on interfaces).
