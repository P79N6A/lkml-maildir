We're running a Dell PowerEdge 6100 and are having the same problem... We
haven't had the problem until just recently (2.2.0), but its also that just
recently our system usage has shot up 200%...  Its not convienient for us to
swap motherboards, unless its a recent defect on the board .. :/
It would be nice if we could find out 'exactly' what is causing this problem
.. defect on the m/b?  incompatibility with the m/b?  bug in kernel?  It's
becoming really frustrating since I talked my fellow employees into
switching the system over from NT to Linux.. Sure the system runs much
faster now, but having crashes like this every other day doesn't do good for
Linux's rep in this case... They agree that linux is a much better system
than NT, but the fact is, NT didn't crash like this .. (I'm sure you can see
my frustration)
So my question is .. does anyone know 'why' this wait_on_bh occurs, and what
a possible fix is ??
