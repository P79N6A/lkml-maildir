Drop anything that is not text/plain and doesn't contain
diff -urN [--exclude-from=dontdiff]
--- yyy
+++ zzz
Maybe bounce when the diff includes any files that shouldn't be part of
the diff (
http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/dontdiff
) with a nice
message to get that file and add --exclude-from=dontdiff or explain that
patches can get dropped silently when they are not in unidiff format,
include generated files, or have any type of non text/plain attachment.
And whenever spam starts 'adhering' to the suggested format of linux
kernel patches we'll get an interesting kernel indeed. Where are the
many (human) eyes in this picture anyways. Do people get to vote
for/veto patches in the patchbot queue?
Evil thought, patchbot would turn into some form of a 'slashdot' with
karma whores and petrified goats and such. Hmm, maybe we should keep
things the way they are right now.
