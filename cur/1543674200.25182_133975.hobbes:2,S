hm, it should in fact have been dead code from 2.5.68 on and upwards.  
Before that it was called quite often.
but doing stuff out of the idle thread is not nice i think, there's a fair
amount of code that does not work out of the idle task. Any reason you
dont start some really-low-prio thread instead? (i could suggest
SCHED_BATCH but the scheduler doesnt have it :-)
