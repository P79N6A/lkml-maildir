Do you mean that implementation of the getattr operation should be
mandatory, or do you mean that generic_getattr shold be called when
getattr is not implemented, like in my patch, and that generic_getattr
should be provided as a convenience function?

I cannot find any stat emulation in arch/*/*. Do you have specific
examples?
