No. The numbers are arbitrary.

Well, if you need to boot both 2.6 and 2.4 _and_ need to use gpm and X
in parallel _and_ need tap-to-click in both gpm and X, then you have to
use the kernel command line parameter and put your synaptics into legacy
mode.
Or, the very nice thing to do would be to port the XFree86 driver to
GPM, so that GPM can understand the event protocol as well.
