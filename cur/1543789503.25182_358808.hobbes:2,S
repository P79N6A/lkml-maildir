This is very difficult to detect when the compiler is inlining the
function code.

From the gcc 4.0 manual,
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.0/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
section ("section-name")
    Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the
    text section. Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
    or you need certain particular functions to appear in special sections.
    The section attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular
    section.
My reading of the passage is that the output code will be put in
the specified section. It does not say wether or not the compiler
is allowed to do any other optimisations it sees fit on the data.
My belief is that the compiler should be able to do this form of
optimisation, unless we tell it otherwise. The only harm is that
it makes it difficult to detect errors from compilers that do not
do it.
