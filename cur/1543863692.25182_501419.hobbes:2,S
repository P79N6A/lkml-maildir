Because then fsx fails.

No, but we can't use invalidate_inode_pages2_range() because it
doesn't handle partial pages. I tried that first and it left warnings
in the syslog and fsx failed.

Yes, but it's a tiny race compared to the other mechanisms
available.

Yes, and that's what I'm relying on to fix the problem completely.
invalidate_inode_pages2_range() needs this fix as well to be race
free, so it's not like I'm introducing a new problem....
