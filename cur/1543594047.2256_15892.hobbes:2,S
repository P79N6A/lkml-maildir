Well, you start by reading this:
http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/doc/SubmittingPatches.html
Which basically says that you post it here, with a title along the lines of:
"[PATCH] promise IDE raid support".
Start the body of your email with a brief description of the patch (the above 
is fine, mentioning that this is an official patch from promise is nice), and 
then include the patch itself at the end of the email in plain text.  (Linus 
won't read Mime attachments, although others sometimes do and forward them to 
him.  Sometimes.)
You do know how to make a unified diff using "diff -u", right?  (I'm assuming 
you have an includeable patch already prepared?)
Also, try to use an email program that doesn't mangle whitespace.  (It's a 
nit-pick, but it's good hygiene.)  The difference between spaces and tabs is 
generally considered to be a good thing to maintain.
