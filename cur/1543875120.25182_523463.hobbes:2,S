Really?  What possible problems can occur?  The worst that occurs to
me is that if someone forgets to call the commit function, the kprobes
will still be disabled, but memory won't be recycled for a while.  Is
this really so bad, considering that a kprobe_unregister is to imply a
commit?  Maybe if kprobe_register can also implied a commit, we can
bound the conceivable memory leak.
Would it be possible to allay even that concern with an automated
deferred/periodic commit?
