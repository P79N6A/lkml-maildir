But the old default system-wide limit was 1024.  And you could have
spawned 8k processes then as well.  So I don't think this matters much.

I don't either, the archives show using per-user as default choice
(never saw a discussion otherwise).  Users can easily queue signals to
themselves (using multiple processes or not), and there was some concern
that somebody actually wanted to be able queue up to 1024 (since it's
what was allowed in the past).

It's an rlimit, so easily setable in userspace at login session time.  I
think we could raise it if people start complaining it's too low (hasn't
seemed to be a problem yet).
