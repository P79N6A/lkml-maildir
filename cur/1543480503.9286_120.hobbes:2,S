  [sent to kernel list since scsi doesn't appear to have a maintainer,
  and CC'd to lnz in case it's a Buslogic issue]
  I have the following SCSI devices all connected via a BT-958:
  Attached devices: 
  Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
    Vendor: MICROP   Model: 4743             Rev: S150
    Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
    Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: FIREBALL ST2.1S  Rev: 0F0M
    Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
    Vendor: IBM      Model: DDRS-34560D      Rev: DC1B
    Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Under kernel 2.1.131 (and 2.0.x):
  Queue depths: 10,7,28:
  everything works fine
  Queue depths: 10,28,28:
  The second drive gets resets every few seconds, until TQ is disabled
  then things are smooth
  Under kernel 2.2.0-pre7-ac7:
  Queue depths: 10,7,28:
  The first drive gets into a continuous loop of SCSI resets, even after
  TQ is disabled, and you get 'can't read inode' errors on the root partition.
  hardware reset requred. 
  Queue depths: Disabled,28,28:
  Everything works fine. Performance of the second drive is noticably better. 
  I know the second drive is a POS, though the first drive seems to be worse. 
  However, Linux does need to have a better mode of failure than continuous
  bus resets. 
  The 'obvious' solution would be to blacklist the Micropolis drive,
  as that seems to make the bus extremely stable, as well as make the
  Quantum Fireball ST behave. 
  However, the change below doesn't appear to do anything. 
  BusLogic=TQ:N does fix the problem however. 
The blacklisting is apparently being ignored due to a change I amde in the
driver when it started checking INQUIRY information directly.  I will work on a 
patch tonight and send it to you for testing.  I've no idea as yet what happens 
with 2.2.0pre7-ac7.  The driver hasn't changed in quite a while, so most likely 
something in the SCSI subsystem has been changed in an incompatible way.
