In the Linux case mmio isn't a problem. The rules for mmio in the portable
code require you use architecture dependant macros (readb etc) and that
the mmio space is mapped via ioremap.
Our ioremap/mmio stuff does a whole variety of things on different platforms
including simple memory accesses, adding I/O fences, motherboard specific
function calls, and tlb bypass.
That side of things is all nicely and cleanly handled.
