I think it's interesting that he saw it with oldconfig. That would
indicate that the way the config was interpreted changed rather than the
config itself. That don't mean that he didn't have an undetected oddness
in the original config which wasn't detected in mm1, but it seems
unlikely.
I looked at some of my old make logs, but I haven't yet built test9 for
a system which doesn't have SCSI.
