I don't see how you can say that, since it appears to be in violation
of RFC 826:
	"The target hardware address is included for completeness and
	network monitoring.  It has no meaning in the request form,
	since it is this number that the machine is requesting.  Its
	meaning in the reply form is the address of the machine making
	the request.  In some implementations (which do not get to look
	at the 14.byte ethernet header, for example) this may save some
	register shuffling or stack space by sending this field to the
	hardware driver as the hardware destination address of the
	packet."
Since the MAC address of the machine making the request is
00:BB:00:BB:00:BB, and not 00:AA:00:AA:00:AA, Linux appears to
be in violation of the ARP RFC.
Regarding the Target IP, RFC 826 says:
	"The target protocol address is necessary in the request form
	of the packet so that a machine can determine whether or not
	to enter the sender information in a table or to send a reply.
	It is not necessarily needed in the reply form if one assumes
	a reply is only provoked by a request.  It is included for
	completeness, network monitoring, and to simplify the suggested
	processing algorithm described above (which does not look at
	the opcode until AFTER putting the sender information in a
	table).
So it's ambiguous about the target IP address in an ARP reply packet,
but a value of 0.0.0.0 makes more logical sense to me than using
192.168.0.1 in this example case, since it should reflect the requestor
IP address, which is unknown in this case.
