You care f.e. if the VM needs to writeprotect a memory range and a write 
occurs. In that case the VM needs to be proper write processing and write 
through an external pte would cause memory corruption.

Ok so I can twidlle around with the inode_mmap_lock to drop it while this 
is called?

Right. Missing within the range. We only need to disallow creating new 
ptes right? Why disallow references?

Use a range begin / end to invalidate a page.

No it was not. I assumed that the convention is always start - (end - 1) 
and the byte at end is not affected by the operation.
