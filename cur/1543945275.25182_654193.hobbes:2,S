Well, that'd be the best approach imho (plus check if all
ioctls which try to modify quotas fails with EROFS as
appropriate).
But the problem really is that it's unknown at this time
where it fails in the first place.  I can't reproduce my
hang "on demand" (mount-ro followed with umount when quotas
are turned on, with ext3fs - umount never finishes), yet
it has biten me for several times already.  So it must be
something rare, some small race maybe, which is difficult
to find...  Yet it finds itself at the most inappropriate
moment. ;)  I already learned to turn the quota off before
doing something with a filesystem, but sometimes I'm
forgetting this, and the result is always the same... ;)
Oh well.
