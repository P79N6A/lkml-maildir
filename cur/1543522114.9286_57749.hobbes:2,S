Yes and no. It's non-trivial but it's in kernel anyway (there are exist
pool for /dev/random and it's very close to be "true cryptographically
secure"). Even if it's not "cryptographically secure" now it'll be fixed
when some problems will be discowered (it's used by GPG and thus it SHOULD
be secure!).
