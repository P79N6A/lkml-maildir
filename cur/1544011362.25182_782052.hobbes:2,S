those macros are historic so feel free to convert them to inlines without 
re-measuring performance impact.
The patchset looks pretty good in principle otherwise, so if you could 
address Andrew's comments and clean up those bits in the next iteration we 
could start testing it in the scheduler tree. (Please also add Balbir 
Singh's acks to the next iteration.)
and please fix your mailer to not inject stuff like this:

It utterly messed up the addressing mode of my reply here and i had to 
edit the raw email headers manually to fix it up ;-)
