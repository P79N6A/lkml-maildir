I agree that if you give a mentally unbalanced person a firearm, they might 
shoot themselves with it.  I am suggesting we take away their firearm.  Write
support for NTFS is useful for migrating from Linux to NT, R/O support is 
useful for migrating NT to Linux.  We won't be giving anything up.  I think
just putting in a nastier warning message would suffice.
