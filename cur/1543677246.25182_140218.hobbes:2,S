Today I've tried the same thing (unload module "snd") on 2.5.69 without any problem...
so there is something wrong in patch-2.5.70.
Using some "printk" I found this:
sound/core/sound.c
static void __exit alsa_sound_exit(void)
{
	...
	if (unregister_chrdev(major, "alsa") != 0)		<-- kernel freeze!
		snd_printk(KERN_ERR "unable to unregister major device number %d\n", major);
	...
}
SO I think that the problem is in last changes to "fs/char_dev.c"...
Viro, according to the changelog it seems that these changes are yours...
<viro@www.linux.org.uk>
	[PATCH] cdev-cidr, part 1
	
	New object: struct cdev.  It contains a kobject, a pointer to
	file_operations and a pointer to owner module.  These guys have a search
	structure of the same sort as gendisks and chrdev_open() picks
	file_operations from them.
	
	Intended use: embed such animal in driver-owned structure (e.g.
	tty_driver) and register it as associated with given range of device
	numbers.  Generic code will do lookup for such object and use it for the
	rest.
	
	The behaviour of register_chrdev() is _not_ changed - it allocates
	struct cdev and registers it; any old driver will work as if nothing had
	changed.
	...
Viro, what do you think?
BYE,
Paolo
