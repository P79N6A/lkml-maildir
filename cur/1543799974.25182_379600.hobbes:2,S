I understand the concept and why things are cached, i've just never seen it 
cache this much before.. usually on a machine with bearly anything running 
on it (like this one) it uses bearly any memory at all.  My concern is that 
with bearly anything running on it i already have dug into swap.
Thanks for the responce, i just wanted to make sure their wasnt some type of 
a memory bug.
