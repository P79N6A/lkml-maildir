Hi,
sorry for contacting you, but I think I found code that isn't correct.
I have Kernel 2.2.9 and had the some error in Kernel 2.2.5. I didn't
find out to solve the problem, but i know that it has s.th. to do withe
the kernel source for the SB Compatible (I self has a SB AWE64). In
Kernel 2.0.36 all is right and all works, but when I tried 2.2.5 or
2.2.9 i got the following
Last Output of "make bzImage > bug.txt":

And then ...

*************************************

msp3400.o(.text+0x1f8e): undefined reference to `register_sound_mixer'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
The wondering is that yesterday all worked fine but i got unresolved
symbols in the module sound.o. Even as I made a 
#make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install
and deleted some relvant *.o code and the modules in /lib/modules/2.2.9
I attached my .config-file cause it might help you in finding the bug
(if it is one =:-)))
Her also the output of #cat /proc/pci with kernel 2.0.36
