	Odd, I have had constant problems with crashes when ever I stressed
my memory system with Athlon kernel selected in the kernel config. Same
machine,  Compaq Presario 700 series. Usually a kernel compile was enough
to cause an opps on one of these kernels. 
	When the path in 2.4.18 in pre1 or pre2 don't remember, it fixed the
problem on my Compaq Presario 700. I've been running the 2.4.18 series
since the patch was added and as of today I have not experienced another
opps of this kind with the Athlon option enabled in the kernel.
	I'll compile a 2.4.18 kernel without the patch tonight and see if I
can generated the crash again.
	I've never seen the VGA console go berserk, and I used it pretty
often. 
	Although I have seen vesafb generate noise on the console, never looked
into it much, because it usually could easily be cleared. I've never noticed
any flicker in vesafb.
