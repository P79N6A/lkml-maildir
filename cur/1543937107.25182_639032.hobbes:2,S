It's OK - I spent some time staring at the output of 'lspci -t' on this laptop,
and convinced myself that the numbers won't matter that much - of the 4 PCIE
ports alledged to be there, 2 aren't connected to anything, and the other 2 are
network (a tg3 and an intel 3945) - and those two are both either (depending
where I am) "essentially idle and will almost certainly sleep" or "busy enough
they likely won't sleep no matter *what* the numbers are".
(That's assuming the chipset in question even *does* ASPM - but it wouldn't be
the first time I've tested stuff just to make sure it didn't enable an impossible
hardware option.. ;)
