Hello,
I'm kinda new to this kernel hacking thing. So excuse me for any stupid questions/remarks.
The problem I have occurs because I'm trying to install the rshaper software on my linux system.
I'm running:
Distribution: red hat 6.2
Kernel ver.: 2.2.14-5.0
System: i386
compiler: gcc
compiler ver.: gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
The rshaper software requires you to modify the 8390 driver kernel module.
I had no problems modifying the 8390.c source to accomodate rshaper.
The problem is that the ne2k-pci.o uses symbols from the 8390.o driver.
these symbols are exported with the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro.
When I load the modified 8390.o (insmod 8390.o)
my /proc/ksyms shows that the exported symbols from 8390.o are different
from the other symbols because they have  "_R__ver_" in front of them.
And when I load the ne2k-pci.o it complains that it can't find those symbols
that were supposed to be exported by 8390.o
I have looked around on the net and this problem seems related to the
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS bug. since I have no clue as to getting
these symbols to be exported correctly maybe someone can tell me
how to get around this problem.
the compile command I used to compile 8390.c was:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -DMODULE -I/usr/src/linux/net/inet -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -m486 -c 8390.c
greetings,
Willem van Doesburg
