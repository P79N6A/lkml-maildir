Sorry about this.  Andrew warning me about this bug, and I saw it myself
with the depmod errors.  I'll take Evgeniy's patch for my tree and it
should show up in the next -mm release.
And as for the "these patches have never been reviewed" comments, that's
why I put them in my tree, and have them show up in -mm.  It's getting
them a wider exposure and finding out these kinds of issues.  So the
process is working properly :)
thanks,
greg k-h
