Subject: [patch 02/33] IB/mthca: Fix data corruption after FMR unmap on Sinai

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@dev.mellanox.co.il>
In mthca_arbel_fmr_unmap(), the high bits of the key are masked off.
This gets rid of the effect of adjust_key(), which makes sure that
bits 3 and 23 of the key are equal when the Sinai throughput
optimization is enabled, and so it may happen that an FMR will end up
with bits 3 and 23 in the key being different.  This causes data
corruption, because when enabling the throughput optimization, the
driver promises the HCA firmware that bits 3 and 23 of all memory keys
will always be equal.
Fix by re-applying adjust_key() after masking the key.
Thanks to Or Gerlitz for reproducing the problem, and Ariel Shahar for
help in debug.
