   2. So, I compiled the kernel with the IPv6 as a module. Now, when I
   attempt to load the ipv6 module. I get some unresolved symbols error
   message that I have pasted in the file attached "ipv6_sym".
It claims just about every external symbol is unresolved, which
is rediculious :-)  Either:
1) You did not upgrade to the latest modutils necessary for
   2.4.x kernels.
2) You did not properly fully rebuild your kernel image after
   changing ipv6 from non-modular to modular in your config
   file.
Later,
