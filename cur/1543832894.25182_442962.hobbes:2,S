So what is the correct design?
Especially for tickless system it's vital for precise timekeeping that the 
timekeeping code knows what the timer interrupt code does.

I'm not sure I'm following, could you please illustrate with an example?

What do you mean with "artificial interrupt relations"?

What do you mean with the "holy grail" of "tick"?
