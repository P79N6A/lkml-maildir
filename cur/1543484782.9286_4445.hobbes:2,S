I would suggest splitting the kernel source into that which might be
required to boot and that which is not required to boot and is easily
handled as a module.
I.e. almost all block device drivers stay with the main kernel tar ball.
Almost all character devices and all network drivers could easily get moved
into a Linux Modules source tar ball that could have an independant (to the
kernel) life. 
Is there any compelling reason for being able to compile ethernet drivers
into the main kernel? They work fine as modules. Ditto for serial, isdn,
sound, etc.
