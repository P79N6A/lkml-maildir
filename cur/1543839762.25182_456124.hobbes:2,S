Your query confuses me, about 4 different ways ...
1) What does sched_setaffinity have to do with this part of cpusets?
2) What did you mean by "statically assigned"?  At boot, whatever cpus
   and memory nodes are online are copied to the top_cpuset's settings.
   As Simon suggests, it would be up to the hotplug/hotunplug folks to
   update these top_cpuset settings, as cpus and nodes come and go.
3) I don't understand what you thought was suspicious here.
4) I don't understand what you expected to see instead here.
