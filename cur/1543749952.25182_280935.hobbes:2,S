Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/10] Replace 'numnodes' with 'node_online_map'
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/23/101

The next 10 messages will contain 10 patches to remove the global
variable 'numnodes' and replace it's use with manipulations of
'node_online_map'.  This will remove the requirement that nodes be
numbered sequentially [0 ... (numnodes-1)] with no gaps in the
numbering.  The removal of this requirement will facilitate node HotPlug
as well as remove the need for some of the arch-specific node
renumbering schemes in the kernel.  Several architectures have to map
their native node numbers to 'Linux' node numbers, and I hope that some
of this may be removed now.
The following 10 patches replace numnodes in arch-independent code and
the 9 architectures that reference numnodes (alpha, arm, i386, ia64,
m32r, mips, parisc, ppc64, & x86_64).  A rollup patch has been lightly
tested (aka: booted) on x86 & ppc64.
Cheers!
