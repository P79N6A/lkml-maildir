Hmmm.. so we could simplify the scheme by storing the last rank 
somewheres.
If the alloc has less priority and we can extend the slab then
clear up the situation.
If we cannot extend the slab then the alloc must fail.
Could you put the rank into the page flags? On 64 bit at least there 
should be enough space.
