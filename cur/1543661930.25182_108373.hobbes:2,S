I buy the sequential-argument - very good point.

I'm curious as to how these things will interact in the NFS
server<->client situation  :)
Time will show, I guess.
Random data-point (not meant as a rant - I'm happy for all I got  ;)
In stock 2.4.20 the interaction is horrible - whatever was done there is
not optimal.    A 'tar xf' on the client will neither load the network
nor the server - it seems to be network latency bound (readahead not
doing it's job - changing min-readahead and max-readahead on the client
doesn't seem to make a difference). However, my desktop (running on the
client) can hang for 10 seconds straight every half hour or so, when the
nightly backup runs on the server (local disk reads streaming at around
2 MB/sec from an array capable of at least 40 MB/sec).
