So what you are suggesting is a lot of layering between the clients
and the hardware.  If you look at the history of Linux I would regard
most of the "middle layer" code as failures, what one does end up with
is a middle layer that is some sort of least common denominator that
makes noone happy.  A much better choice is to place common code (what
usually ends up in a middle layer) in a library, so that a driver can
choose either to use the common code, or to implement its own better
version that can take advantage of the hardware if possible.
