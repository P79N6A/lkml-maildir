It's actually a problem with queuing more than one bulk URB in the uhci 
driver.  (The TTY line discipline is probably splitting your single 
write into two or more writes, and the ftdi_sio driver queues an URB for 
each of these individual writes.)

The recommended advice (from David Brownell) seems to be to avoid 
queueing more than one bulk URB, though the "alternate" UHCI driver 
(uhci.o) seems to be the only one with this problem as far as I can tell.
I'll probably implement a different write implementation for the 
ftdi_sio driver to avoid the problem when I get a bit of free time.

Copy the previous .config across and run 'make oldconfig'.
