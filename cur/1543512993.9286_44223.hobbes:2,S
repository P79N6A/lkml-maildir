It looks like that's how some other OSes do it. Note that we are talking
about passive detection here. 
As Rogier explained, we had a  discussion here and he expressed reservations
wrt sending packets for detecting duplicate  IPs, and on my side, I realized
that what I wanted to do could create a loop.

I've looked at it when I saw the comment in the code (probably yours)
/* Special case: IPv4 duplicate address detection packet (RFC2131) */
> Shortly: ARP packets with your IP source are legal and common phenomenon.
 
Would you maintain that statement if I  check that the source MAC address is
different from mine?
In  other words,  is there  any good  reason for  an ARP  packet with  my IP
address as the source, and a source  MAC address that is different from mine
to exist (without it being a conflict that the kernel should whine about)?

I wouldn't quite  say frequently, but you're right, it  is very possible for
network equipment to send some datagram a second time.
Would you  agree with my patch  once I add a  check to make sure  the source
hardware address is different from mine?
I'm also  considering checking if  the source MAC  address is the  same than
mine, but the source IP is different  from all the IPs my MAC has. I've seen
indies at SGI that came back from the shop, and had identical MAC addresses.
Would you have a problem with such a patch?
If not,  I'll update my  current patch to add  your suggestion, and  add the
duplicate MAC address check after getting a few hours of sleep :-)
Best,
Marc
