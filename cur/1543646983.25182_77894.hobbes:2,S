Well, don't use vpath in the kernel Makefiles ;)
To restore the previous state, just do
obj-y += ... ../kernel/trampoline.o
However, why don't you just set CONFIG_X86_SMP when CONFIG_VOYAGER is 
selected, which would be cleaner anyway?
Compiling the same file from different subdirs depending on .config is 
surely a recipe for confusion.
