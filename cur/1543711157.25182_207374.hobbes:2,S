Well, I can confirm that, as Mr. Machek said, swsusp and pmdisk gave me the
same functionality on a Vaio fx-701 laptop. I do not know why 2.6.1 didn't
work, but there have been a lot of ACPI updates, maybe that's the key. 
Before suspending I unload pcmcia, sound (alsa), autofs, and usb hid
modules. If someone is interested I canb try not to unload something an
report back what happens. 
I will try during the long weekend (tomorrow's holiday here) the bleeding
edge patches from Nigel, and report back. 
Thanks to all,
              Romano
