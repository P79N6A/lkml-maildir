(in the code, and in lkml discussions, as usual. There's tons of code 
that correctly handled it and continues to handle it. Let me be clear, 
this isnt some obscure side-effect, this is one of the cornerstones, 
preempt_disable()/enable() always had these semantics, and this is very 
much being relied on in a number of areas.)

this just hides bugs and introduces bugs. From a critical section POV a 
voluntary preemption is almost the same thing as a voluntary preemption 
- the task may wander to another CPU, and smp_processor_id() might 
become different. If it's not a problem for your code to preempt then 
just enable preemption before calling it. Anyway, preempt_disable() / 
preempt_enable() is pretty much an internal interface and shouldnt be 
used lightly.
