We had been through that way too many times.  You know what problems
with unified device struct I've brought before.  You know what
problems I have with your 64bit dev_t.  And you know _very_ well that
any patches in that area should be done in small steps.
Hell, I'd prefer that one to be done _much_ slower - with decent
debugging between the steps instead of "we've got to close the
holes opened by bdev-in-pagecache _NOW_" kind of situation we'd got.
IMO eventually we should have per-disk structure and keep reference to
it from struct block_device.  Then get_hardsect_size() wiuld turn into
access to field of that beast (and would take struct block_device *
as an argument).  But that's 2.5 stuff and I bloody refuse to participate
in attempts to do everything in one huge leap.  One we'd got is already
bad enough.
