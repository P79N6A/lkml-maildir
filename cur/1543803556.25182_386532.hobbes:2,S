Please give the complete list of kernel boot options that
you used.
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt does say (for IA-32)
to use mem= and memmap= together in some cases.
And there are some comments in the source code
(arch/i386/kernel/setup.c) but they probably don't help
any more than the Doc file does:
  * "mem=XXX[kKmM]" defines a memory region from HIGH_MEM
  * to <mem>, overriding the bios size.
  * "memmap=XXX[KkmM]@XXX[KkmM]" defines a memory region from
  * <start> to <start>+<mem>, overriding the bios size.
