You didn't make anything store or return the dma_addr_t ... that was the
issue I was referring to, it's got to be either (a) passed up from the
very lowest level, like the pci_*() calls assume, or else (b) cheaply
derived from the virtual address.  My patch added slab support in common
cases where (b) applies.
(By the way -- I'm glad we seem to be agreeing on the notion that we
should have a dma_pool!  Is that also true of kmalloc/kfree analogues?)

Go back and look at the dma_pool patch I posted, which shows how to
handle that using extra padding.  Only one driver needed that, and
it looks like maybe its hardware spec changed so that's not an issue.
That's why the signature of dma_pool_create() is simpler than the
one for pci_pool_create() ... I never liked it before, and now I'm
fully convinced it _can_ be simpler.

I think that's a desirable way to specify dma_alloc_coherent(), as handling
page-and-above.  The same layering as "normal" memory allocation.  (In fact,
that's how I had updated the docs.)
