Subject: PROBLEM: select() on TCP socket sleeps for 1 tick even if data available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[1.] select() sleeps for 1 tick even if data available
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
	If select() is waiting for data to become available on a TCP socket FD,
and
	data becomes available, it doesn't return until the next clock tick.
This
	produces large latencies when passing data between processes several
times,
	since each transaction (which requires microseconds) does not occur
until
	the next clock tick, limiting the entire throughput of the system to
100
	transactions/second.
[3.] Keywords: select, socket, networking
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version): 2.2.18
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (not applicable)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
	#include <sys/time.h>
	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	/* this program should take 1 second to complete, but takes 10 */
	/* yes i know, it doesn't do any I/O, but the behavior is the
		same as if it did */
	main()
	{
	        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
			struct timeval to;
			to.tv_sec = 0;
			to.tv_usec = 1000;
			select(0, 0, 0, 0, &to);
		}
		return 0;
	}
[7.] Environment
	Red Hat 7.0 with kernel upgraded to 2.2.18
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
	ver_linux di dnot appear to work. However, here's its output.
