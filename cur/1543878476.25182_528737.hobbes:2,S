If we can come up with an interface that makes sense in the context of
NFS, then we should be able to push it into a future minor revision of
NFSv4. It is unfortunately looking too late to push it into v4.1, since
the final drafts of the RFC are already circulating.

We could perhaps teach nfsd to open the file without the O_LARGEFILE
attribute in the case of NFSv2?

Not really.
However on NFSv3 and v4 there is actually a mechanism for declaring that
the existing set of cookies have expired and are no longer valid: you
have an 8-byte opaque 'verifier' which is supplied by the server, and
which is supposed to be returned by the client on every call to READDIR.
If the server wants to change its cookie scheme, then it signals it to
the client by changing its verifier, and returning an error whenever the
client tries to use the old verifier. Upon receiving that error, the
client is supposed to clear out all cached cookies, and read the
directory in again from the start.
In practice, though, this sort of behaviour has to be managed carefully
by the server. Forcing a client to re-read the entire contents of the
directory doesn't really scale too well...
Note also that we would have to fix the client implementation. Nobody
has bothered working on the code to handle verifier changes since there
are no servers out there in the wild that use it.
