This is by far the biggest issue btrfs has for simple/domestic users.
Its probably the most tested miss-feature of btrfs, something almost
all new testers encounter & report.
Is fixing this having maximum priority?
The sooner this is fixed, less energy is spend by everyone
(entusiasts, testers, bug reporters, bug triagers, mailing list
campers..etc) and we might save some whales, dolphins and pinguins by
reducing our carbon footprint. :)
Kind regards.
