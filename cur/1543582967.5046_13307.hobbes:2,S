Hello all, I'm just wondering if is / will be support for the Promise
Supertrak 100 and the likes in the kernel...
If anyone have any pointers to where I can find info about this it is deeply
appreciated...
A company has bought three Supertrak cards + 18 drives, and I don't want to
install WinNt on those boxes...
