Well, the comment for cpuset_cpus_allowed() says
/* 
 * Description: Returns the cpumask_t cpus_allowed of the cpuset
 * attached to the specified @tsk.  Guaranteed to return some non-empty
 * subset of cpu_online_map, even if this means going outside the
 * tasks cpuset.             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 **/^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since this behaviour has been documented, I presume there is a reason
behind it. 
So either we're incorrectly using cpuset_cpus_allowed in
sched_setaffinity or we're missing something subtle :)
Thanks and Regards
