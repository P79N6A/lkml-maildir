According to Alan Cox:

I just booted 2.2.18pre5, not having tried 2.2.18pre4 yet, on a
machine with an AMI Megaraid card.
During boot it hangs at:
megaraid: v1.11 (Aug 23, 2000)
megaraid: found 0x8086:0x1960:idx 0:bus 1:slot 5:func 1
scsi0 : Found a MegaRAID controller at 0xfc800008, IRQ: 40
[HANGS]
2.2.17 on this machine does:
megaraid: v107 (December 22, 1999)
megaraid: found 0x8086:0x1960:idx 0:bus 1:slot 5:func 1
scsi0 : Found a MegaRAID controller at 0xfc800000, IRQ: 40
megaraid: [GH8E:1.44] detected 1 logical drives
scsi0 : AMI MegaRAID GH8E 254 commands 16 targs 3 chans 8 luns
[etc etc boots as it should]
As this is actually a clients system I can't go around rebooting
their system all day long, I just wanted to check out the /proc
stuff of the newer megaraid driver. I'll see if I can produce
more info later this week.
Mike.
