I put this exact fix into the net-2.6.24 tree several days ago
already, it's not nice that you didn't even bother checking.
When I saw the response to the help@ address, I could almost predict
that the myri10ge developers would not even check if net-2.6.24 had
the issue cured already.
Therefore, your patch doesn't even apply to the tree where it is
relevant.  That sucks.
