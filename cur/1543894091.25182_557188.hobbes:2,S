Now that I have posted the group scheduling patch stack, we can come
back to this point.
Basically I am maintaining a ->curr field in 'struct lrq' (when
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED is on). It is NULL if the lrq is "inactive" [ none of 
its entities are currently running ], otherwise it points to the currentive 
active entity. This helps me optimize some functions like update_curr() - when 
lrq->curr is NULL, we don't have to update fair_clock etc upon enqueue/dequeue 
to the lrq.
pick_next_entity() sets lrq->curr while put_prev_entity resets lrq->curr
to NULL.
Also these lrqs could form a hierarchy. At the top could be a lrq which
holds user-level sched entities on each cpu. Next, each user's lrq could
hold task-level entities.
So when a task moves from RT class to NORMAL class, it will get added to
one of the lrqs (say root user's lrq on CPU0). At that time, I need to:
	root_user_lrq[cpu0]->curr = &task_moving->se;
	top_lrq[cpu0]->curr = &root_user->se;
I have added a special callback set_curr_task() in fair_sched_class to
accomplish this.
Similarly when a task moves from NORMAL class to RT class, I need to:
	root_user_cpu0_lrq->curr = NULL;
	top_lrq_cpu0->curr = NULL;
For this I am reusing the put_prev_task() callback.
I have to accomplish the same steps when a task moves from one group to
other also.
Let me know what you think about set_curr_task() callback [in Patch #6]. The 
other option was to tackle this requirement in enqueue/dequeue_task (if
current task is being enqueue/dequeued then set/reset lrq->curr), which I felt
add unnecessary overhead in normal path (a current task for ex gets
dequeued when it goes to sleep).
