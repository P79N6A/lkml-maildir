This is wrong.
If that happens, then you should just make access_process_vm() use
"page_cache_release()". That's what you basically make "__free_pages_ok()"
do, but since you still have to add the BUG_ON() check to make clear that
it is illegal to do this from an interrupt context, it's much better to
just do this check statically.
