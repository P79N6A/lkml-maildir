The kernel source pretty close resembles what the kernel supports
(except the broken drivers). Make the source your database. Propose
source code formatting rules, and let the userspace parse it (assuming
the proposal find the way into source). Make the hardware descriptions
readable in the object code, so the userspace can pick up new modules
and activate them if a new pci-id is seen. Etc...
It's already of such use for some of us, who are about to get a new
hardware and trying to figure out if it can be useful:
egrep -rn 'vendor|cardname' .
