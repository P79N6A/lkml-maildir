Ignore this ... Andreas' patch was only two lines so I
thought I'd "save time" by just hand-editing the source over
on my build machine.  I managed to goof that by editing the
wrong  function for one of the cases. :-(
New result.  With Andreas's patch correctly applied, the generated
vmlinux is identical with/without your patch.
