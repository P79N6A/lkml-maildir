Benno never answered my question if he had disabled update when doing the
tests on 2.2.8+ kernels. I still fear that this could've been a problem in
his setup. The new kflushd works differently then update which sync'd on a
which wasn't all that intelligent. Certainly if you run a new kernel with
kflushd and at the same time the good old update you are not doing it
correct. So I'd really wanna see somebody test it while being sure the old
update is not running.
