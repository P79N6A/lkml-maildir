Kernel headers should and in fact are stable WRT common userspace
interface. If they aren't, you're forced to recompile the userspace
anyway.
BTW: it's ok to compile things like glibc against new kernel headers
(say, 2.6.x) and use the resulting library with older kernels (as old
as 2.2 I think). In fact it's the preferred way to compile glibc.
You can disable support for older kernels with glibc/configure
--enable-kernel=VERSION --enable-oldest-abi=ABI.

Sure. Examples: ioctls for configuring the system.

I think at this point we have to create include/abi (or api) as a part
of the kernel. The mess with distributions-provided "glibc kernel
headers" must at last be cleaned.
Should no one have time for doing that I'm going to start.
