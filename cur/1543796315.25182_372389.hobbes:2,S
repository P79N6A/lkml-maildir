If you can characterize all your data needs in terms of points to
insert hooks (breakpoint addresses) and expressions to sample there,
systemtap scripts can probably track the relationships.  (We have
associative arrays, looping, etc.)

systemtap can optionally use relayfs.  The printf you see here does
not relate to/invoke the kernel printk, if that's what you're worried
about.

We haven't done much work yet to address on-demand kind of interaction
with a systemtap probe session.  However, one could fake it by
associating data-printing operations with events that are triggered
purposely from userspace, like running a particular system call from a
particularly named process.

The degree of bloat is under the operator's control: systemtap only
uses initialization-time memory allocation, so its arrays can fill up.
