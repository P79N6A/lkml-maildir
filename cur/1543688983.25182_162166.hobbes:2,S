good catch. Have you ever trigger this bug, or did you find it via code
review?
just to explore the scope of this problem a bit more: at first glance all
other timer_pending() uses seem to be safe. del_timer_sync()'s
timer_pending() use is special, because it's next to the ->running_timer
check without any barriers inbetween - so we could indeed in theory end up
with having the two reads reordered and a freshly added timer (on another
CPU) not being recognized properly. Also, this is the only timer API call
that guarantees the complete stopping of a timer.
