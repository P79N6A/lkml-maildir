Is it not possible to write an automatic conversion tool that reads the 
existing CML1 files and outputs CML2 rules with identical behaviour?
After all, the only way for the merge of CML2 to be acceptable is to merge
the tools _first_, without changing the resulting behaviour of the config
rules, and then to make behavioural changes in later versions.
