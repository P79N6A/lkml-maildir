In the case the first entry goes away, having a list could help being able 
to the next one to use very easily.  But this probably just an 
implementation detail.

Any address.
One notable case is that the outgoing interface has only link/site-local 
addresses and the destination is global.  There are other cases too.

I had already woken up :-).
At least BSD and I think Linux create ad-hoc, "cloned" routes e.g. in Path
MTU discovery process to hold some different values.  I don't remember the 
details.  I was wondering if this would be done the same or not.
change state = move to deprecated, move to non-deprecated.
Hope this clarifies.
