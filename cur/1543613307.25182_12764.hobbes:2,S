You'll know better than me.  A little suprising they haven't shown up yet,
but if those put_page()s might remove the last reference to an anonymous
page, which traditionally couldn't be on an LRU, but now can be, then yes:
either those put_page() calls must be replaced by page_cache_release()
calls, or the function formerly known as page_cache_release() should be
renamed put_page() (and macros and EXPORTs adjusted).
When Linus first put anonymous pages on LRU (2.4.14-pre), he started out
with a dedicated free_lru_page(); and once that had shown up the inter-
esting bugs, relaxed and rolled it into page_cache_release().  I think
if you can show the problem with the net ones (or more likely, it's as
obvious to Linus as it is to you), he might now happily relax and roll
it into put_page() instead.  Perhaps go the whole way to __free_pages(),
but I doubt it.  Linus?
Whatever, it appears not to be a high priority: sorry if I've diverted
you from the main thrust of your veclet (I love that name) work.
