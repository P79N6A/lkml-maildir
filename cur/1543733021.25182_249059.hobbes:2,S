I don't know if you anyone can claim the "kernel way" except Linus, if he
decideds our argument is worth it, then it becomes the kernel way as far
as I'm concerned... what you mean is the way things are usually done,
which may not always be applicable in every case,

I've got nothing to do with Tungsten whatsoever, I've never met any of the
other major DRI developers, my worries here is this is turning into a
company issue, people keep mentioning Fedora this and that, Fedora is one
distro, I happen to use it, lots of people I know dont.. it supports DRI
on IGP and i915 in Fedora 3 Test only, a DRI snapshot works on FC1 and
FC2 as well..

Again what about distros that only do security upgrades in stable
releases, I would like to give those people a chance to use their graphics
cards, and the snapshots are not the only way, Intel have i915 Linux
drivers on their site from TG, they work on most kernels/distros, I get a
machine with i915 install Debian go to Intels website and download their
drivers, it all works, now why do I have to compile a kernel again?
