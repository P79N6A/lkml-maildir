OT probably...  So how does one go about getting 'gitweb'?
I now see a couple of .git files in the snapshots dir that I grabbed 
this morning:
[amanda@coyote src]$ ls -l |grep .git
-rw-r--r--    1 root    root           66398 May 26 09:01 patch-2.6.12-rc5-git1.gz
-rw-r--r--    1 root    root          196014 May 27  2005 patch-2.6.12-rc5-git2.gz
Do these include that fix?
