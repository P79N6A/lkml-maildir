This is a hardware error. I also have a buggy motherboard (586DX) and
experience the same problems. Looke at /proc/interrupts, there you can
see how many errors are detected. The problem is that double errors are
not detected - these can lead to system crashes or block network/isdn
cards.
If there are only a few APIC errors, it is very unlikely that a double
error occurs, if there are very many, the probability is high.
It seems that there are quite a lot of motherboards that have a buggy
APIC.
There is some patch by Alan Cox in the 2.4.4-ac series that does
something about this problem but I do not know what exactly.
The only thing you can do is boot with the "noapic" option, and disable
IO-Interrupts on the second CPU (I assume you have a SMP system?). This
will reduce the amount of errors but there is also a performance
decrease.
