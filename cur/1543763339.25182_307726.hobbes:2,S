I should have been more clear. From what I understand, when some devices
are probed they also want to probe and add their children. It *seems* like
this is essentially true with USB devices and interfaces, though I could
be wrong.
What I meant was that when the parent device's ->probe() method is called,
the parent's semaphore could be taken before the children are discovered
and added. This would keep the parent locked while all the fiddling is
going on with the children. Right?
