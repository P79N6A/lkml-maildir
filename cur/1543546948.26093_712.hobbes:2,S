To be honest, those who do speak first language English, but who have the
problem of things not working right in words in their head (quite common if the
body is too fast for the brain, or brain too fast for the body), it still comes
across rude.  It is one thing to tease a friend; it is an entirely different
thing to tease someone you have no clue about... you do NOT know how they will
react.

P.S. Anton, I don't use any NT based file systems, but I know people who do. 
Thank you on their behalf.
