   Except that the math is INTEGER, not floating-point,
   which means that this way you loose precission.
   You HAVE TO do multiplications first, only then (finally) the division.
   Depending the value-spaces, small-enough value-spaces might be
   turnable into table mappings.  However that has lots of dependencies
   in hardware architecture, e.g. memory access speeds, cache pollution,
   speed of multiply/divide operations, etc.
   If dividers/multipliers are constants, and powers of two, the math
   can happen with constant shifts, which are fast at all systems.
   If not, things get rather complicated.   (And thus a careless -1,
   or lack of one, may be costly.)
