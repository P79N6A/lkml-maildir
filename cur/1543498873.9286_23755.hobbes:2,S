Hi,
Problem this morning, just after my daily updatedb process ran on
this 2.3.6 machine (ix86, egcs-1.1.2, glibc-2.1.1). Named (bind
8.1.2) stopped working, but it never fails in this way on 2.2.9
The problem? It gives up with the error
named[5066]: cache zone "" (IN) loaded (serial 0)
named[5066]: master zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" (IN) loaded (serial 1)
named[5066]: master zone "7.168.192.in-addr.arpa" (IN) loaded (serial 1)
named[5066]: master zone "223.196.151.in-addr.arpa" (IN) loaded (serial 1)
named[5066]: master zone "localdomain" (IN) loaded (serial 1999031101)
named[5066]: master zone "billabong-media.com" (IN) loaded (serial 1999031101)
named[5066]: get interface configuration: No buffer space available
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and here's the relevant strace line
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 4
ioctl(4, SIOCGIFCONF, 0xbfff772c) = -1 ENOBUFS (No buffer space available)
free tells me:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    cached
Mem:         62832      60992       1840      14232       1312    11960
-/+ buffers/cache:      47720      15112
Swap:       525128      52228     472900
Bumping /proc/sys/vm/buffermem up to "2 10 70" fixes it... should it
be this way?
info -f libc tells me:
 - Macro: int ENOBUFS
     The kernel's buffers for I/O operations are all in use.  In GNU,
     this error is always synonymous with `ENOMEM'; you may get one or
     the other from network operations.
 
This is a great pity because, otherwise, 2.3.6 is perfectly stable
here.
Any ideas? Thanks for reading this
