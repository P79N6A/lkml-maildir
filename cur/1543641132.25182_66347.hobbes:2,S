That was the default for mke2fs.
Tried compress instead of gzip. Same problem. I guess the compressed file
is too big for the kernel. The 8MB compressed (from 24MB) didn't work. 6MB
compressed from 18MB worked. The 24MB filesystem has just one extra junk
file in /tmp to fill up the filesystem to 90% and this caused the system
to hang.
I'm thinking it could be the ungzip function in the kernel that's causing
the problem.
Jeff.
