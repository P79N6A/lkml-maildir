Apparently, mount does not work with partitions located on a 3ware RAID
(8006-2PL controller) in a dual-Opteron box (64-bit kernel).
If the kernel is configured with preemption and NUMA, it cannot mount any
"real" filesystems and the output of "mount" is the following:
rootfs on / type ext3 (rw)
/dev/root on / type ext3 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nodiratime)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
(hand-copied from the screen).  I have tried some other combinations (ie.
preemption w/o NUMA, NUMA w/o preemption etc.) and it seems that it works
better with CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE set, although even it this case some
filesystems are mounted read-only.
The mainline kernels (ie. -rc3 and -rc3-git[1-4]) have no such problems.
Greets,
Rafael
