| Well, since I can't rewrite the app, I can't make it sched batch.  Nice

Sched batch is a kernel modification, and a simple wrapper will allow
you  to run _any_ program as sched batch without modifying it's source.
The design has had that ratio of 20:1 for a very long time so now is not
the time to suddenly decide it should be different. However if you want
to make it 100:1 for your machine feel free to edit kernel/sched.c
and change
#define MIN_TIMESLICE		( 10 * HZ / 1000)
to
#define MIN_TIMESLICE		( 1 * HZ / 1000)
That will give you more what you're looking for.
