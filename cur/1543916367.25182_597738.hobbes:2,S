Sure, if it will be not comfortable.
But if kbuild deals with this transparently, it must be OK. Brokenness
due to binutils, kbuild, root user bugs won't garbage source. Only thing
to ask from experienced users *and* kernel developers, is
`useradd kbuild`, everything else will not bother anybody.
I just express my vision, of course. But see, i can't play with kernel
sources error-free now. If i type some `make` somewhere in obj or src
tree, i need to know, that vanilla source stays so in any circumstances.
Currently it's not.
It is about making things in order on my working place (not looking to be
in order, though :). Not thinking every time, if something fscked sources,
saves my and time of diff/patch. Experimenting/testing/finding fixes with
small amount of in-development sources in obj tree, also very helpful.
