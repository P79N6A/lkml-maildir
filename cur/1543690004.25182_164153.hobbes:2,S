If you count only "bugs" which cause hang or oops, sure. But just
because something works doesn't make it simple (or non-complex if you
prefer). But look at all the "lockless" changes and such in 2.4, and I
think you will agree that there have been a number and it is complex. I
don't think stable and complex are mutually exclusive in this case.
