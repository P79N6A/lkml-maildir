hi , Alan .
after numerous attempt on the networking problem in 2.2.10-ac11 &
2.2.10-ac12 ( even try untar a clean tree and patch up to try) , the
network inaccessible problem still exist for my 3c905 nic.
As a last try , I decide to give 2.2.11pre2 a chance and the problem with
the network is "GONE" --its o.k.
It seems that certain function in the ac series that you'd drop for the
2.2.11pre2 had some bugs that causes the networking problem.
hope that this information could help u to trace the bugs
thanks
best regards
