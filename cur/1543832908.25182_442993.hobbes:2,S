compatible with what? What changes do you expect that will break kinit
as we have it right now?

klibc without user is really pointless.

Why? If they want that new feature:
download kinit-2.0, make && make install. That concept is not new.
kinit-2.0 will surely be compatible with what is required for last years
kernel because its not maintained by the-average-udev-developer kind of
people.

Are you saying that everyone now suddenly is forced to use a cpio image?
Why did hpa add the loop mount code to kinit?
So if you force people who build kernels to use newer tools, one more
external binary will surely not hurt.
