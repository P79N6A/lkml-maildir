I am not sure you're agreeing or disagreeing :-).  As far as I understood, 
Ingo is worried about:
	struct s { /* some fields */; char *buf; };
	struct s *p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct s) + BUF_SIZE);
	p->buf = p + sizeof(struct s);
Which could lead to false negative due to p->buf pointing to p.  However, 
for us to even _find_ p->buf, we would need an incoming pointer _to_ p 
which makes me think this is not a problem in practice.  Hmm?
