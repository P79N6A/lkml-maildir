Have you checked that in all cases all fields of the struct have
been overwritten?  For instance, look at this:

Doesn't this leave chp->dev.bus still holding whatever old value it
had laying around before?  Unless I'm missing something, it looks to
me like this diff causes a change in the semantics of the code.
Perhaps it would be better to memset() the entire struct (chp->dev, in
this case) to zero, before assigning to individual fields, so there is
no possibility of old remnant data still being left laying around?
