Sorry to bother you, but are you sure you spelled it correctly? The 
latest I could find was 3.x.1c-pre3 on the namesys ftp server.
I have the same problem on a machine (made worse by the fact that the 
filesystem was a RAID0 partition).
I keep getting "wrong superblock", even after I told reiserfsck to 
rebuild the superblock.
I won't pretend I know much about filesystems, so - is my situation 
hopeless? (meaning, does RAID mess things up even worse?) Am I doing 
something wrong? Is there a difference between -pre3 and -pre4 which 
might change the response of --rebuild-tree?
Thanks for any help
Eugenio
