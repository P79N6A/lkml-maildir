only a handful buggy editions of that compiler did in a few corner
cases. And they were really buggy, and they were corner cases. Nobody
should be using a compiler like that; and nobody is expected to compile
software with a broken version of that compiler (iirc the window in
which it was broken was really small). There is a limit to userspace
brokenness that the kernel should work around. This imo is on the other
side of the line.
