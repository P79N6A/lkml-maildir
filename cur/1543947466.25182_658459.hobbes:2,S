This is not quite what Peter and I were thinking of, I think. It's not
at all generic. How about a section that simply contains a set of
function pointers, a macro to add things to that section, and a function
that calls all the pointers in that section. Eg:
CALLBACK_SECTION(init_cpu_amd, "cpuvendor.init");
invoke_callback_section("cpuvendor.init");
..which would give us a generic facility we could use in various places.
