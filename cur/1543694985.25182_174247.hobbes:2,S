Hi
I experience aborts with external usb hd, that also pause all disk
operations for some seconds.
It doesn't happen with 2.4.21 kernel.
Please tell me if I can do anything useful to debug the problem. I can use
kgdb or other techniques.
It's getting very annoying since the disk stays for more than 10 seconds
without responding.
