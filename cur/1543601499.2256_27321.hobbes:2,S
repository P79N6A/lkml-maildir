Please consider making it a configurable option. 
My Asus A7V133 runs perfectly well with 55.7=1 and so does at least
another mobo brand that was reported here. If it can work out of the box,
leave it that way. Since this register is undocumented the patch below is
a hack. Sure it works on people hitting the problem but it is still a
hack. As such I don't want to use it if I don't have to.
-K.
