Thanks, -rc4 did fix the bug.
I noticed profiling the kernel with PREEMPT_DESKTOP that mcount and
__mcount add quite a bit of overhead.  Something like .5% CPU each.
Sorry, I didn't save the oprofile output.
So, disable CONFIG_MCOUNT if you want minimal overhead from the RT
patches.  IIRC it was previously stated that the latency tracing
overhead could be mostly avoided by disabling it at runtime.
