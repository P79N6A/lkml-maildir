Hello.
does the current linux 2.4.x series handle new controller additions.? I have
seen the new pci hotplug
interfaces, but iam not sure if the scsi midlayer can handle new controllers
showing up.?
for eg: if during scsi_register_host() i have just one controller. If i add
another one after system is up, will this 
framework be able to handle this new controller in the mix? if there is a
mechanism to do this
what should the low level hba driver writer do to make this happen.?
i have seen some hooks do add/probe new devices on the already existing
adapter, (only add, not sure if remove would work)
if someone knows the answer please reply to me.
