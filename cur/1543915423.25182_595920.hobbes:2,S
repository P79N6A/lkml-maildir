OK, in that configuration it's much better.
It boots with nohpet alone and suspend/hibernation seem to work (still,
it didn't want to boot right after hibernation, but booted after I'd switched
it off/on manually).
Unfortunately, I get this in dmesg:
ALSA /home/rafael/src/mm/linux-2.6.23-rc6-mm1/sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:1758: hda-intel: ioremap error
and (obviously) the sound card doesn't work.
Additionally, I've got a couple of these:
WARNING: at /home/rafael/src/mm/linux-2.6.23-rc6-mm1/drivers/usb/core/driver.c:1
