Ah yes you're correct. I saw the patch in the kernel SRPM but didn't look
far enough to see:
...
# IDE patch provides UDMA66 support, but is known to corrupt filesystems
# on a few systems, so is not applied by default.
Patch151: linux-2.2.16-ide-20000805.patch
...
# Dangerous IDE patch available but off by default
#%patch151 -p1
...
Still, with hdparm -d1 -X67, I can presumably get UDMA3 and good 2.2
speeds (17Mb/s, or 21Mb/s with rawio) without this patch.
Cheers
Chris
