	No, you don't create a pid attribute per task.  The sysfs file
is literally your large attribute.  So, instead of echoing a new pid to
"/sys/kernel/config/ckrm/group1/pids", you echo to
"/sys/ckrm/group1/pids".  To display them all, you just cat
"/sys/ckrm/group1/pids".  It's exactly like the file you want in
configfs, just located in a place where it is allowed.

	Not really.  It's not identical (tons of attributes live in the
configfs part but not the sysfs part), and it has a clear deliniation of
what each does.

	If you can't do it in sh, it's pretty much out of scope.  This
is a taste rule I use, because like to shell program.  Sure, not the end
of the world (not a hard rule, I guess), but worth thinking about.

	By your definition, sysfs, configfs, and other fs-style control
mechanisms are too complex.  We should all just be using ioctl() so that
coders and users have only one namespace :-)

	How do you implement it?  Full on seq_file with restrictions
(ops->start,stop,next,show)?  Some sort of array (how do I placehold
where the last read(2) was)?  Some sort of linked list (again with the
placeholding and locking)?  Anything short of seq_file+restrictions
would be perhaps binding that traversal, no?
