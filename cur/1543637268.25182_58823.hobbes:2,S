Hi! 
Rather reproducible oops right on bootup. I copied the traceback
by hand since I had no other way to copy it.
The machine is a Dual PIII with the Serverworks IDE chipset. 
It was boot with the append="max_scsi_luns=128" Kernel command line
option.
FYI: Same machine- same config - 
Kernel 2.4.19-rc3-aa1 boots fine, but crashes with a serverworks
message.
Kernel 2.4.19-rc2 worked fine 
Kernel 2.4.19-rc2-aa1 crashed with a serverworks message. 
I'm going to try jam1 now. I saw it contains some serverworks fix.
Follows what I could do to decode... Not very much to go by, I know... 
Any more information you'd like me to supply - I'm here.
