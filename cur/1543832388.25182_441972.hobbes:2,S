note that I'm not picking sides. I don't care which ego gets to win.
What do care about that Linux ends up with a good implementation,
whatever that is. I have no idea is uswsusp will make it (in fact it
feels fragile to me, but then again all sw suspend implementations
including swsusp2 feel fragile to me). But for crying out loud
PICK ONE AND MAKE IT GOOD.
Bang heads together. Go for beer at OLS. I don't care how, but anything
to prevent the insane thing of having multiple half working
implementations.
