What's the rationale for this?
Given that later in cpusets.txt you say:

why can't the same thing be done when changing the 'cpus' file manually.
What's wrong with, in update_cpumask(), doing a loop across all
members of the cgroup and updating their cpus_allowed fields?
The existing cpusets API is broken, since a new child can always be
forked between reading the tasks file and doing the writes.
