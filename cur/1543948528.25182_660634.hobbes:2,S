It doesn't _need_ the file in the strictest sense, the header file is 
just there for the core SELinux code to call into the NetLabel/SELinux 
glue code (what is in security/selinux/netlabel.c).  However, if this 
is to conform better to kernel coding policy (I assume that is the case 
here?) then that is fine with me.
