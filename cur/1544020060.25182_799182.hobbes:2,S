Hi, I was wondering how IO schedulers such as as-iosched, deadline and
cfq behave on SSD
(that have virtually no seek time), from a theoretical point of view.
How do they affect
performance on these devices?
I heard that the noop scheduler is often chosen by owners of EeePcs
(with a SSD unit).
They report superior performance by using this (quite simple) scheduler.
Are there any scientific benchmarks around?
