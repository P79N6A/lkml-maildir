Hi Linus,
I think it's better that we defer some of the asynchronous boot stuff to
2.6.30 so that it can bake in -next for a bit. I would like to keep the
core infrastructure in place for 29, so that the various subsystem
patches etc can just use it in -next without generating dependencies in
the patch flow.
for both libata and the inode delete very simple things can be done to
fix them, but I would feel a lot more comfortable giving these a ride
in -next.
The following changes since commit
