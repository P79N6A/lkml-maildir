Affirmative... A while back, my PC always used to make strange sounds when the hlt instruction was engaged/disengaged. It was a whine that changed in pitch. This happened in any OS that used it.  (Linux, Windows NT/2000, Windows 98 with the Rain CPU cooler program etc.). I just figured that was normal for my PC, until one day my power supply fan died and I had to replace the power supply. That was the last time I heard it.
