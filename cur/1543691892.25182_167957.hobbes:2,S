Just as a point of interest, as an application programmer I think it's
the type of thing you want to know about quite loudly.  The only
benchmark style figure on this I've ever seen is in this paper
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vcconWindowsDataAlignmentOnIPFX86X86-64.asp
(forgive the long url) which, if you scroll down to the little graph,
shows OS fixup is about 450 times slower that an aligned access.  That
sucks, and if I didn't realise I'd done it, it would suck even more.
Oh, and I think fixing it up automatically & warning is much more
useful than sending a (by default) terminating signal to the program;
though I'm sure others might disagree.
