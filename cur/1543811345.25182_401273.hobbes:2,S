It's never bad if someone converts drivers still using cli/sti.

I'm agreeing that this is a good idea, I simply disagreed with your
"we suck at..." point, since although we can become better we aren't 
that bad.

IMHO, the real problems we already know about are not warnings, they are

And in these cases, the bugs in unmaintained areas of the kernel like 
APM or the floppy driver are the worst ones.
