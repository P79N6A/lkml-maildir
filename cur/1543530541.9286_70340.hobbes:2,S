Yes, I know. This does avoid the performance hit - but it still wastes
obscene amounts of swap space unnecessarily, and makes the original
problem worse by reducing the available amount of memory.
On a WWW server with 100 Apache processes of 20Mb, for example, I would
need 30Mb or so normally - or 2Gb with this strategy, even though 1.97Gb
of this is never used. This means I will run out of memory a LOT sooner -
I have 1.97Gb less VM than I otherwise would! This certainly doesn't help
the original problem...
James.
