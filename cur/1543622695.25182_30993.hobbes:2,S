	No...  That's patently not true.
	They won't accept contributions from us, but we touch
their code all the time.  If we didn't, how would we get any testing
done, which they do accept from us.
	Also, several of them have stated on several occasions (this is
the prerequisite religious war that pops up every few months) that
they have no say in what other people do with the code (subject to the
license of course) and that inclusion of klips in the mainline kernel
would be beyond their control, yeah or nay.  Klips is the ONLY part
of freeswan that would go in the kernel.  Pluto (IKE) is the user
space part.
	They won't accept contributions from US developers to their code
base.  That does NOT mean that they will not accept contributing the IPSec
kernel code to the kernel and the incorporation of klips into the kernel
source tree.

	Yes.  FreeSWAN.  And the FreeSWAN developers have as much as said so.
