This is not right. If you look in the Makefile for LC_ALL, you'll note
that the assignments are made having an indent in front of them (meaning:
execute as shell command.)
Convert those indents to spaces, and you're good to go. I'm not going to
bother submitting a patch because pan is surely going to munge it again.
