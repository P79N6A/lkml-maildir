Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs for i386 2.5.44
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/28/23

Doesn't apply to -mm5 because someone did wierd things with the CPU
placement in driverfs, which clashes with this patch which moves it to
kernel/cpu.c...
Usage:
1) Apply patch, and boot resulting kernel.
2) echo 0 > /devices/root/sys/cpu0/online
3) echo 1 > /devices/root/sys/cpu0/online
The CPU actually spins with interrupts off, doing cpu_relax() and
polling a variable.  It's basically useful for testing the unplug
infrastructure and benchmarking.

Cheers!
