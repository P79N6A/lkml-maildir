Hi Russell,
   I received a system with one of these misidentified UARTs we were
discussing.  The proposed addition to your solution works almost as
advertised.  The only trick is that size_fifo() doesn't like coming in
with 0xBF in the LCR.  I added a simple save/clear/restore and all seems
well.  This probably needs to be checked since I have a very limited
assortment of UARTs to test.  The complete patch is attached below.  I'd
be more than happy to run any additional test cases on this system.
Please let me know if this looks reasonable.  Thanks,
	Alex
