We can do that. Worst case, someone needs to teach me enough sed to grok 
the 'bk export -tpatch' output, find the line matching
'^# This patch contains the following deltas:$' and spew output from that 
till the first line matching '^#$'. Ideally, there'll be an easier 
way of getting the info from bitkeeper though.
Oh, and would anyone mind if, after feeding the mail through diffstat and 
seeing zero lines of change, I aborted sending the mail?
Further criticism of the scripts will only be accepted in diff -u form 
unless you have an excuse at least as good as having been told personally 
by Larry that you're not allowed to use BitKeeper.
