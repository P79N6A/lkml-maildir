Random incidental cleanups.

Not tested. AFAICT it's returning random garbage somewhere near the
beginning of the kernel stack now but haven't checked the answers
generated at runtime to see if they look valid. This at least vaguely
resembles the intent of the code, but it might actually want
(task)->thread.esp0 or other such nonsense and so on now that I think
about it some more.
At the very least it looks plausible and doesn't perform accesses that
aren't actually on the stack as they're supposed to be when you shrink
the stack to 4KB. AIUI those kinds of out-of-bounds accesses to
potentially freed memory are oopsable with some debugging patches like
manfred's that unmaps freed pages.
