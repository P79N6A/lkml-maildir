Hi to all,
I hope I can contribute somehow to your effort with the following: 
I got this error message after having succesfully patched up to 2.2.7
All worked fine up to 2.2.5. (with the same .config of course)
(The only problem being my serial port 16550A mistaken for 16750
 but that was solved by commenting out detection of the latter)
(I am not on this list so if you answer CC me please)
drivers/char/char.a(msp3400.o): In function `msp3400c_init':
msp3400.o(.text+0x1f22): undefined reference to `register_sound_mixer'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
