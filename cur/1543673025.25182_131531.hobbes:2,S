I'm not sure that I follow that, but
    a) kernel.bkbits.net is fully backed up nightly so we wouldn't lose it
       there
    b) the CVS tree is generated on my desktop so we have a mirror of it
       there
    c) HPA mirrors the CVS tree to kernel.org so we have a third copy there
    d) Regenerating the the CVS tree from scratch will generate the same
       revs.
In other words, I think you're safe.  Famous last words, we'll now discover
that our friends in .cz have written the world's first BK virus and it 
corrupts the CVS tree.  Or something.  Regardless, we've taken steps to
make sure the CVS data is safe and restorable.
