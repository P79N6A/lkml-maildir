We (OSDL + others) are working on a continuous build/test system, using the Mozilla tinderbox.
Should be available RSN. Tinderbox supports multiple clients, and we'll
have a client package available for download. 
Marco, if you could supply time on a small client box, and a desired .config,
we can add you as a Tinderbox client,
 then you have a place to point people when the size increases. 
Either way, please send me your desired .config - i can and should 
build a size test into the tinderclient code.
