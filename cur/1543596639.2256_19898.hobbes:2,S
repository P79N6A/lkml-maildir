The user-mode port of 2.4.6 is available.
Many bugs have been fixed, including a number of hangs and crashes.
The network helper is more helpful, especially for ethertap.
hostfs now supports device nodes
64-bit IO is now supported by the ubd driver and hostfs
There is now a management console, which is a low-level interface into the 
kernel - it allows the machine to be forcibly halted and allows disks to be 
added to and removed from a running system, see 
http://user-mode-linux.sourcefo
rge.net/mconsole.html for the details.
If you're not installing the RPM, you should update the userspace tools from 
CVS, especially uml_net (tools/uml_net/) and uml_mconsole (tools/mconsole).
The project's home page is 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
