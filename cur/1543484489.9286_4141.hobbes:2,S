Alan, I respectfully disagree (partly).  I don't think it's at all
extreme to assume that people don't have source to everything on their
system.  I also don't think it's extreme to expect commercial
operations to iterate through the release-engineering process at the
whim of the linux kernel developers.
I think we can both agree that it is certainly trivial to break module
compatibility.  But I think it's also trivial, in _general_ to
maintain module compatibility in _most_ cases.  I'm not saying that
certain changes, like the f00f or teardrop fixes, shouldn't have gone
in.  On the contrary, I agree that those are reasonable changes to
have made, even in a stable release.  But you have to admit that
breaking module compatibility for 'cache speed improvements' is _not_
reasonable, right?  So the question here is: where is the line of what
is reasonable and what is not?
I'm not trying to define that line here.  I'd like to trust the kernel
developers as a group to be reasonable and generally do the right
thing.  I'm just trying to remind people of this issue, to point out
that there needs to be a conscious decision on everybody's part to
maintain module compatibility as much as possible.  Really, all this
means is that we have to be careful what patches go into a stable
release, and if it is not absolutely necessary for the patch to go in,
it should go into the development tree instead.
Besides, Alan, it's not just IBM here -- they just happen to be the
first (transitive property through me).  I know of at least a
half-dozen other hardware vendors who support linux through binary
kernel modules.  I'm probably just the most vocal of the group ;)
FWIW, I don't work for IBM, and I never have.  I created Linux-AFS as
a summer job, and I have maintained it ever since on my own time, as
an individual.  So, for the last four long, hard years I've been
trying to perform a _FREE_ service to the Linux community, in
particular everyone in the world who uses IBM's software.  Also, in
case you didn't know, neither IBM nor I made a single penny off of my
work.
The reason why I didn't write 'Arla' was that the RPC subsystem that
AFS uses, Rx, was not publically available in 1994.  Also, it was
faster to start with the existing implementation, and we needed a
solution as soon as possible.  I applaud the Arla team, but they had a
lot more to work from than I had.
