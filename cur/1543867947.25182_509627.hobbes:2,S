BTW, most often it will be a specific user application.  The initial
intended use case was a Java Virtual Machine, that will set the
Tainted flag as a hint to support personnel that Java program it was
running was doing something really evil and non-portable (direct
access to physical memory) which unfortunately the RTSJ compliance
test requires us to support .  Thank you very much, Sun....
