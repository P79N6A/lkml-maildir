It looks to me like this will catch
foo = (char *) kmalloc(512);
but not
for = (char* )kmalloc(512);
I haven't tried it but how about something like:
if($rawline =~/\(.*\)\s*k[czm]alloc/){
which if I got it right should match the typecast with any combination of spacing.

Could the warning be more descriptive?  This describes what, but it should also describe 
why; after all if somebody made this error they may not know they why.
