A serious question about your proposal then:
The .config file doesn't excusively contain information regarding
what hardware to support.  It also carries a lot of information about
the functionality and the optimzations the user wishes to incorporate
in his kernel.  How would localconfig deal with that?

BTW: Considering that you are not out of your mind (most of the
time), I admire your courage in bringing up this subject.  ;-)
