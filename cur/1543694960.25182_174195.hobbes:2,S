Bullshit.  "myrng 36 | foo" works just fine.

/dev/random and /dev/urandom are in the kernel because they are
clients of the kernel's entropy collection system, period.  There is
no other justification for their inclusion in the kernel, and using
them as motivation for sticking a pure PRNG in the kernel is daft at
best.
