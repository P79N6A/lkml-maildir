Playing with my desktop machine (which is newer and completely different 
from the servers) I've found that I run out of entropy -REALLY FAST-, 
even this one is supposed to have those hardware random stuff generators.
Is this a normal behaviour?, or, I think i've readed this somewhere, 
it's encouraged to use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random?
Salu2.
