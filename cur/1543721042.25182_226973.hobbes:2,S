| But the error you report:
Yeah _thats_ the confusing thing. The lines 100% okay, I checked that
twice, with grep and with opening the file. After I patched 2.6.6 source
with the 2.6.7-rc3 and the -mm1 patch I checked that first because I had
problems with that at office. I was surprised to see it fixed, so I made
an cp .config and make oldconfig and make bzIamge modules, but I got the
same error. So there must be something else wrong
lg, clemens
I'll be happy to help as much as I can.
