I have done some more tests today and got to the conclusion that the
kbd delay for this kbd varies from 210 to 250 ms (when set to 250ms).
I also noticed that I double some keys some time, even with my 200ms
fix.  Well, IMHO this is due to the fact that I am too accustomed with
_normal_ 250ms kbd delays - that I sometimes rest my fingers on a key
for a time close to 250ms - therefore getting another interrupt.
I see you changed the delay from 200 ms to 100 ms.  Well, I was just
about to propose to change the delay, too, but to 250ms rather than to 
100 ms :-)
For arrow keys: they are sending two MAKEs and the corresponding two
BREAKs, but these are all different - this patch does not interfere.
This patch might break smth only if there is an imaginable
scancode-sequence in which two consecutive occurences have the same
scancode and are closer than 250ms.  I cannot think of such a case,
but I can only think in terms of PC hardware, I don't know about
others...
So the patch might look like:
