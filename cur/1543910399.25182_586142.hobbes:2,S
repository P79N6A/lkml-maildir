I would like to thank the people who responded to this posting for  
their help.  It helped keep me from wasting additional time trying to  
use SOCK_PACKET over PPP just because the DHCP code in Red Hat used  
it for ethernet.  (The dhclient code did it to ensure that the  
ethernet/IP/UDP headers were to their satisfaction, and to avoid some  
bugs in older versions of the Linux kernel).
I've tested through a serial/PPP connection without issues.
This is obviously not a normal configuration, having to run a DHCP  
client through PPP, but the IP addresses are assigned via a DHCP  
server, but he router we connect to via PPP won't retrieve addresses  
from the DHCP server for us.
Thanks,
Kevin
