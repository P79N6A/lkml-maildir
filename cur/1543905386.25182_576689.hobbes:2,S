Considering that your last merge was two years ago something goes wrong - 
and I suspect something goes wrong at 5.
If you download the latest -rc kernel at step 1 there should usually be 
no problem to let your patches Andrew add them to -mm and him forwarding 
them to Linus at the next merge window instead of running into point 5.
If there are conflicts with some bigger cross-architecture changes they 
should have been mentioned at 3.
I'll look at why it goes wrong when you submit your patches the
next time.
