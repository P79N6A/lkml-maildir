Certain known bugs are being reported over and over. Here are the
workarounds.
- Blank screen after decompressing kernel?
  Make sure your .config has
  CONFIG_INPUT=y, CONFIG_VT=y, CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y and CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
  A lot of people have discovered that taking their .config from 2.4 and
  running make oldconfig to pick up new options leads to problems, notably
  with CONFIG_VT not being set.
