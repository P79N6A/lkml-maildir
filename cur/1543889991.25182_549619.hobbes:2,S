You REALLY want to tell me, a developer and maintainer of several
big projects, how debugging is done, being a non-developer and non-hacker?
I can't believe what I am reading here.

Please quote me where I called someone dumb.
Ah, yes. I am inhuman and whatever. We know that already.

Ah, no? I think you didn't completely understand the mail.
Steve reported a bug in b44 2.6.22. Please note that 2.6.22 does NOT include
ssb. But I'm sure you'll find a way to make me responsible for
this bug, anyway.
b44 is buggy and this is NOT caused by ssb. Re-read steve's mail.

Oh, poor poor guy.
I lack knowledge about b44? Oh, I suppose that was a typo and you
meant yourself.

Andrew, I see that you are in a bad situation now.
I respect every decision you make. But please still
consider that b44 works perfectly well for me. I tested it
today on _all_ kernels that did not work for Uwe in this thread.
On my device (BCM4401-B0) it works on all of these kernels.
I'd suggest we leave the code in the -mm tree and wait for
someone else to show up with a bugreport.
It's simply impossible to debug this problem with the help of Uwe.

Uwe, I just added you to my killfile.
Don't bother sending mail to me any longer. It will not arrive.
I'm not interested in your stupid "bugreports" anymore, as they are
useless and consist only of personal insults and
personal miscreditations.
Welcome to the killfile of yet another kernel developer.
