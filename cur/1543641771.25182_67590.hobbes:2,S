   Or did the __FUNCTION__ extension from gcc change? Someone please
   explain.....
CPP pasting __FUNCTION__ is now deprecated because for c++ you
cannot do it at compile time.   At least that is how I understand
the problem.
The long and short of it is that __FUNCTION__ cpp string pasting
is now illegal.
