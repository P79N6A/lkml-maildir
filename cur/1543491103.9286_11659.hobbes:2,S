  Also, how do I specify which scsi ids become which disks?
  My boot disk is now ID #6 on the first scsi bus (its /dev/sda),
  I understand if I add a disk at ID #4, it will become /dev/sda.
  How do I modify this behavior (id #6 should stay /dev/sda).
check out richard gooch's devfs, which is a virtual /dev (virtual the
way /proc is), and names scsi disks according to their physical
location, rather than the the order they were located by the kernel
at boot
so the scsi device on id4 always has the same /dev name, irregardless
of what other devices you may or may not have attached. very useful.
