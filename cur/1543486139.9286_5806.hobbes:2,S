Hello,
Sorry for bother this list with a sound card problem but I have been
trying getting help anywhere and I got no success in solving my problem. 
My problem is the same as this guy wroted below, except that my sound card
is a Sb 32 PnP. 
After message, there's the output of cat /proc/pci. Well, I heard
something about VIA chipset and sound cards conflicts. I dont know if this
can be my case.
Oh, I have a Pentium 133 MHz, kernel 2.2.1. I use isapnp to initialize my
sound card. My motherboard is VXPRO. 
P.S.: I tried to put an old Sb16 non-PnP with same configuration (IRQ 5,
DMA 1 and 5, 220, 330, 388) and it worked really fine.
