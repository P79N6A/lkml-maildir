Here is a snippet from my trace log (slightly reformatted):
61899.88 0.14 schedule_timeout pid(132)
61900.01 1.75 schedule pid(132)
61901.76 0.49 do_IRQ pid(132)
61902.25 2.84 do_8259A_IRQ pid(132)
61905.09 0.47 handle_IRQ_event pid(132)
61905.56 4.78 rtc_interrupt pid(132)
61910.34 0.82 __wake_up pid(132)
61911.16 0.49 wake_up_process pid(132)
61911.65 0.35 reschedule_idle pid(132)
61912.00 0.64 mod_timer pid(132)
61912.64 0.73 enable_8259A_irq pid(132)
61913.37 0.14 do_IRQ pid(132)
61913.51 0.66 do_IRQ pid(132->309)
61914.17 2.65 __switch_to pid(309)
The "wake_up_process" puts pid(188) in the run-queue and the
"reschedule_idle" sets pid(132)->need_resched = 1.
However, pid(309) is switched in and does not have need_resched = 1.
I am not running SMP only UP; a snippet from reschedule_idle
follows:
---------------
#else /* UP */
        int this_cpu = smp_processor_id();
        struct task_struct *tsk;
        tsk = current;
        if (preemption_goodness(tsk, p, this_cpu) > 0)
                tsk->need_resched = 1;
#endif
}
----------------
Is my theory valid?
