Hi,
When building Linux-2.5.40, I noted that usb-uhci is renamed to (or maybe a
complete reimplementation) uhci-hcd. How can I set up /etc/modules.conf so
that depending on the kernel that I am running either usb-uhci (2.4.x) or
uhci-hcd (2.5.x) is chosen for the usb-controller ? Is there some simple
alias trick that I am missing ? Is it possible for usb-uhci to be built
with linux-2.5.x ? I didn't see any option when doing a build from scratch
(make mrproper menuconfig).
Please CC me on any replies as I am not on this list.
-kitty.
