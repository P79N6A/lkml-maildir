Hi Nick.

I can't find it at the moment, but I remember reading somewhere that
the BogoMIPS values are NOT comparable between different processor
families, and the P2 is a different family to the P-MMX.
As a datapoint for anybody wishing to make comparisons, my system has
an AMD K6-2/350 which shows 699.60 BogoMIPS on both 2.0.36 and 2.2.5
kernels. I believe that's the correct sort of figure for the processor
in question...
Best wishes from Riley.
