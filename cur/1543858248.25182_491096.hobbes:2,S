Yesterday I was in an audio seminar from Meyer Sound and the AES, and
discovered an audio analizer that uses Linux OS, and I mean that it
uses the fftw open source libraries. In the details of the product,
not appear any word about gpl and linux.
Please, investigate this case:

In the case, that I viewed the system was installed in the hard disk
of a laptop.
