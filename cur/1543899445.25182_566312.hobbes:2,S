Interestingly, I also noticed the possibility of O(1) task pickup when
playing with v18, but did not detect any noticeable improvement with it.
Of course, it depends on the workload and I probably didn't perform the
most relevant tests.
V19 works very well here on 2.6.20.14. I could start 32k busy loops at
nice +19 (I exhausted the 32k pids limit), and could still perform normal
operations. I noticed that 'vmstat' scans all the pid entries under /proc,
which takes ages to collect data before displaying a line. Obviously, the
system sometimes shows some short latencies, but not much more than what
you get from and SSH through a remote DSL connection.
Here's a vmstat 1 output :

Amusingly, I started mpg123 during this test and it skipped quite a bit.
After setting all tasks to SCHED_IDLE, it did not skip anymore. All this
seems to behave like one could expect.
I also started 30k processes distributed in 130 groups of 234 chained by pipes
in which one byte is passed. I get an average of 8000 in the run queue. The
context switch rate is very low and sometimes even null in this test, maybe
some of them are starving, I really do not know :

With fewer of them, I can achieve very high context switch rates, well above
what I got with v18 (around 515k) :
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id

(this is still on my dual athlon 1.5 GHz).
In my tree, I have replaced the rbtree with the ebtree we talked about,
but it did not bring any performance boost because, eventhough insert()
and delete() are faster, the scheduler is already quite good at avoiding
them as much as possible, mostly relying on rb_next() which has the same
cost in both trees. All in all, the only variations I noticed were caused
by cacheline alignment when I tried to reorder fields in the eb_node. So
I will stop my experimentations here since I don't see any more room for
improvement.

Hmmm that must be why I do not have /proc/sched_debug anymore ;-)

Done !
