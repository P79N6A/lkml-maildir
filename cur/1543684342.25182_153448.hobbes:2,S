The only place where a kernel driver may veto is when doing things
like firmware flashing.
If you want to veto suspend when burning a CD, it's userland policy. We
still need, I beleive, to define/write a proper userland-side API for
all these with the daemon that goes with it. That will be next step once
we have the kernel side working properly ;)
