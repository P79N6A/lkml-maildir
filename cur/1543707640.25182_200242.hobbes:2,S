Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem to work if you
don't have /dev/null before it gets mounted.
I got
Creating initial udev device nodes:
/etc/rc.d/start_udev: line 90: cannot redirect standard input from /dev/null: No such file or directory.
and it didn't boot.
My first rc.S lines have:
mount -vn -t proc proc /proc # Needed for LABEL= in /etc/fstab
mount -vn -t sysfs sysfs /sys
/etc/rc.d/start_udev
