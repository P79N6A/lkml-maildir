I understand the flexibility that this provides, unfortunantly (IMHO) 
default udev rules (or at least what many distros are shipping by default) 
changes from this simple naming scheme in a way that hides the fact from 
the user. This means that many users will not even realize the change in 
policy until the hardware changes and things don't act the way they were 
expected to. In my case it was removing 3 quad cards from a machine and 
finding that there was no eth0 on the box, instead there was a eth12, this 
is fairly benign. what would have caused me significant problems would 
have been having a card fail in a production box, have it replaced and 
then found that the interfaces were now eth4-eth22 instead of eth0-eth18. 
having the interfaces named differently on different boxes with identical 
hardware based on the history of what has been plugged into the boxes in 
the past is not what sysadmins expect.
