Strictly speaking, you are probably right.  According to this:
http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=canonize
sense #2 would qualify "canonize".  I took the position that the only
person who could "canonize" anything is an elderly Polish fellow living
in Rome. But I've been wrong before.
The tortured variant "canonicalize" has seen enough usage to warrant
this related entry here:

As far as "no such words" go, a descriptive grammar is generally more
useful for human languages than a prescriptive grammar.  Healthy human
languages allow for growth.  See Tao Te Ching 76. (late night rambling)
