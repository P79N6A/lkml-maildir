Hi,
On my Sony Vaio laptop, some device is named "VIA 82C686A/B". I think
that this is my southbridge chip. This causes problems because the
name has a slash inside of it. I get the following error from a find
command:
find: /driverfs/bus/pci/drivers/VIA 82C686A/B: No such file or directory
How should this be resolved?
-Nathan
