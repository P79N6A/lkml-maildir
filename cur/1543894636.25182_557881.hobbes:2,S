I just talked to Ulrich Weigand, who explained to me that
__attribute__((packed)) should not be specified on a typedef that is
not also a struct/union/enum definition, because it can not change the
type anyway.
Also, the attribute((aligned(x))) works differently in a typedef than
in a field or variable declaration:
In your struct foo, __attribute__((aligned(4))) does not have any
effect because the attribute on a field declaration will only increase
the alignment if you specify a larger value than the default alignment
for the member type.
In struct bar, you have two members that both have type with a default
alignment of 4, because the typedef overwrote the default alignment
for the compat_u64 type.
