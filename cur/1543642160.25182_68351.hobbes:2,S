Ah, of course.  Thanks.
We'll still have a significant volume of pre-constructed objects
in the partially-full slabs: it seems that these things are fairly
prone to internal fragmentation, which works to our advantage in
this case.
So yes, perhaps we need to hang onto some preconstructed pages
for these slabs, if the internal fragmentation of the existing
part-filled slabs is low.
