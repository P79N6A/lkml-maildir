Considered doing that with buffer_heads a few years ago.  It's impossible
unless you have a global lock, which bh's don't have.  dentries _do_ have a
global lock, and we'd be tied to having it for ever more.
The shrinking code would have be able to deal with a dentry which is going
through destruction by other call paths, so dcache_lock coverage would have
to be extended considerably - it would have to cover the kmem_cache_free(),
for example.   Or we put some i_am_alive flag into the dentry.

Yes, some help would be needed in the slab code.
There's only one list_head in struct page and slab is already using it.
