I was screaming out loud because I did not see the patch coming. It
simply materialized in Linus' tree. Exactly because PM is hard, I'd
expect "here's rewrite of driver model, please test it on your
hardware" mail on lkml before it is merged.
Anyway, ad uhci: it seemed to work well in -test3. What's current
status of pm_send_all() interface? I think pm_send_all() was
responsible for UHCI working...
