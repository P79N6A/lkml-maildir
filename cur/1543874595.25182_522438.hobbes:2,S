Hi Andrew,
	This is a re-send of a series of patches concerning futexes (here
after is a short description).
	I have reworked the patches to take into account the last changes
about futex, and this series should apply cleanly on -mm tree (the changes
mostly affect patch 2 "futex_wait uses hrtimer")
	I also took into account the remark of Peter Zijlstra in patch 3 
concerning futex_requeue_pi.
	Could you consider (again) them for inclusion in -mm tree ?
	All of them have already been discussed in January and have already 
been included in -rt for a while. I think that we agreed to potentially 
include them in the -mm tree.
	And, again, Ulrich is specially interested by sys_futex64.
There are:
    * futex uses prio list : allows RT-threads to be woken in priority order
instead of FIFO order.
    * futex_wait uses hrtimer : allows the use of finer timer resolution.
    * futex_requeue_pi functionality : allows use of requeue optimization for
PI-mutexes/PI-futexes.
    * futex64 syscall : allows use of 64-bit futexes instead of 32-bit. 
Thanks,
