Hi, 
 I have installed 2.4.7 version of the kernel in my machine.
I am facing a problem with telnet where all connections are refused.
 When I grep for telnetd there is no telnetd  running.
If I try to start it the error reported is ,
"telnetd:getpeername:socket operation on non-socket"
I checked for the inetd.conf file it is not present in the /etc directory.
 I want to know does this xinetd.conf file helps or,
what else could I do to start telnetd.
I have done a "Everything" (All packages) installation of RH7.2 but no inetd.conf
Thanks ,
Rohit
