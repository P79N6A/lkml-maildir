If there is no maintainer and there is demand for the driver then I
guess the end users need to remember its a development model and not a
charity. The problem should then be self correcting if the docs/driver
are open

No. If the code is open source the user can get it fixed, if it is
closed source then they are screwed because support is by vendor dictat.
If Nvidia drop TNT2 you can't pay a local consultant to fix it.
