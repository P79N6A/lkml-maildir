Yes!  I want to confirm that it DOES 'just work' with this one
little thingy I missed:
I needed to add TWO boot flags because of the way I have my
kernel configured:  'nodevfs' AND 'devfs=nomount'.
Without the 'devfs=nomount' flag the kernel was starting devfsd
anyway, which keeps udev from working, apparently.
So, Greg, please be nice to Martin, who is working hard to
get gentoo people out of your mailbox.
Thanks to both of you, and Happy New Year!
