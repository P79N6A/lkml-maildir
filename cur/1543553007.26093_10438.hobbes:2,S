Ok, I reported it several times, but it gets ignored. I have a Realtek
8029 (ne2k-pci), and with both drivers ne and ne2k-pci I can easily get
it stuck by doing a ping -f to a host in the local net, and sometimes it
happens doing copies to/from nfs shared resources.
rmmod & insmod don't cure the problem, it seems that no interrupts are
delivered from the card, and there are no log messages, so a reboot is
needed to restore net access.
System is dual 2x200mmx 96Mb ide discs no interrupts shared, and as far
as I can remember all kernel from 2.2.x, 2.3.x up to 2.4.0-testx exhibit
this problem.
