So pass relative events as is and do conversion of absolute to relatives. 
That's what I gonna do about my track stick as well.
Remember that mousedev provides _emulation_ of [Ex]PS/2 mouse protocol for
almost any device, it does not do any advanced tricks it's here to use with 
old software that does not have advanced drivers yet, you are not "loosing"
your absolute mode packets, you hav /dev/input/eventX to access them.

Right, and if device says that it can generate relative packets mousedev 
should not get in its way and do its own absolute->relative conversion.
