Doesn't this just allow smbfs to list the file? If you tried to read all
of it you'd only get the first 2G of it (or is it 4 ...), repeated over
and over.
2.5 has proper support for large files on smbfs, for 2.4 there is a patch
here:
	
http://www.hojdpunkten.ac.se/054/samba/index.html
(if you can reach that site, the admins have been very "creative" lately ...)
If anything is going into 2.4 I'd prefer if that was it. Maybe for 2.4.20,
I have had some positive reports on that. Note that you need to patch
samba or else the server won't know that the client supports large files.
