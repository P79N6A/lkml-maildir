Ok. I'm not counting device suspend/resume time, but if you do, the percentage 
will vary according to the image size (since the device suspend/resume time 
should be independant of image size).

Yes, 14,000 lines for that alone would be a bit too much :)

You misunderstand me. Let me reprhase. What additional dependencies do you 
have in userspace to support this? libabc, v >= x.y.z etc.

Am going, as I do with all responses. Please just remember that taking them 
into account doesn't equate to slavishly doing everything suggested.
