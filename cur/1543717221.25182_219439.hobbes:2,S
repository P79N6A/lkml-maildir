> How about dynamically allocating up to a certain limit.
Given that disk space is essentially "free", how does that
differ from simply allocating swap files up to the desired
limit size?
And having a bigger swap space wouldn't help your thrashing
problem.  You're not thrashing (unusable system, mucho disk
activity) for lack of swap space.  You're thrashing because
you are trying to use the swap space you already have for
active pages.
