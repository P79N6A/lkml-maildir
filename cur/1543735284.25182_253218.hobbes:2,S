Yeah, I think overly patterned matched on this one.  I just
grabbed the code from spinlock.c and do what I normally do to
make it lockmetered, but in this case since its a _raw_ routine, I
should have left it alone.  It just needs to be duplicated in
lockmeter.c, not lockmeter'd.
So that middle line there should be:
	_raw_read_lock(lock);
instead.  I'll get this straightend out with Andrew shortly.
