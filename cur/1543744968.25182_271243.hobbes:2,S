In that case a boot param solve the problem, it says you could
desactivate the resource in the bios/acpi for the mouse.
So even if a mouse is plug, the other driver shouldn't receive others 
interrupts (I don't know exactly what happen if for example irq12 is 
used for pci and mouse in acpi config and if there are other protection 
again that case...)
