Hi Greg,
looking through the pl2303 driver, it seems you know about
the internals.
So I'm contacting you to ask if you got specification for this device.
I have got a pl2305 (usb to parport) device and it seems there's no
driver for it. On the Prolific page there is a datasheet download,
but it seems to be incomplete.
It seems that I could get basic functionality to work with it, but
it seems to be missing a lot.
Any suggestion on where to get proper specs for this device?
Or do you even know where a driver is hidden? :)
