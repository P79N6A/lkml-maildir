I picked up a bug in ialloc.c back in February, for which I submitted a
poorly constructed patch (for which I was privately and properly flamed;
as I recall my subsequent attempts to post an improved version failed
for various reasons which may or may not include ORBS).  Anyway, the
basic idea is clear:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=95162877201890&w=2
I'll make a proper patch out of this if you like.  This *could* cause
the effect we're seeing here.
