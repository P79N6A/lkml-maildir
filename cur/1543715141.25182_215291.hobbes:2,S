I've applied this patch to my 2.6.6-rc1-bk4 kernel, and have not noticed a
reoccurance of the error since then.  I had a mini "test-suite" (basically
copied 48Mb of files to the device, "sync"ed, then deleted the files and
then "sync"ed again), which I've run 6 times without a flaw - previously the
error messages were happening on a frequent basis.
Therefore, I'm fairly confident that the patch has solved my issue.
Thanks,
