RH5.2 w/2.2.1, aiming at any random host that's unreachable:
	[1053] [12:51:43] beaver:~> telnet news.redhat.com nntp
	Trying 199.183.24.231...
	[ minutes pass ]
	[ drumming fingers on desk ]
	[ finally hit ^C ]
	[1054] [12:58:54] beaver:~> 
I first noticed this because Gnus inside XEmacs was trying to make
essentially this same connection, hanging XEmacs entirely as a result.
It seems to be generally the case for me, that attempts to contact
unavailable hosts w/TCP just don't ever give up and return ETIMEDOUT.
Is my experience unusual?  Or is something seriously wrong?
