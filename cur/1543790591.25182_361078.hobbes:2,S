Subject: autofs timeout and large map

I think I may have discovered a bug.  But perhaps I overlooked
something -- looking for advice.
I have generated a DIRECT map file and defined it in /etc/auto.master.
 My direct mappings look like this (located in /etc/auto.virtual):
   /virtual/USERNAME \
      /public --bind 127.0.0.1:/usr/local/files/public \
      /private --bind 127.0.0.1:/usr/local/files/USERNAME
My /etc/auto.virtual file has 1345 entries very similar to the example
provided  (not wrapped like the example above).  Everything works like
expected for the first mount.  When the mount timeout expires,  the
mount will not auto remount.  When I try to `ls`, it gives the error:
   "No such file or directory"
When --ghost is enabled most directories look like this when autofs
first starts:
   drwxrwxr-x    2 virtual  virtual      4096 Oct 28 14:45 private
However after the timeout they look like this:
   dr-xr-xr-x    2 root root      0 Oct 28 14:45 private
Once I restart autofs it mounts again fine the first time.  For now I
have set my timeout to 24 hours which functions as a work-around but
clutters up my mounted filesystems.
My system is in production and I can't recreate the problem right now
lest I interrupt users.  I have done my best to recreate the actual
directory listings and error messages that I saw but they may not 100%
accurate as they are from memory.
Thanks for any advice,
Dannie
