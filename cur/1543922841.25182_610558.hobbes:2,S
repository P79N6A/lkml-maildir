I see. My device has two buttons.
However even in this case, if you never eject the device, then switch
off (sleep), change the device into the slot and then power on (wake
up), with my patch everything continues to work as before.
The differences come up only if you eject the device before power off.

Do you mean to switch off the socket from userland? It could be a
solution but in this case the device is powered on each time even if
for a short delay...
Maybe we can add an entry into sysfs? Or just a module parameter? So
developers can choose their preferred behaviour. :)
Thanks for your time,
Rodolfo
