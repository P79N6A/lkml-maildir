I have tested kernel 2.6.24-rc7-git4 with the build in rtl8187 module
and I have the same problem.
I can't ping the AP if the rate is set to auto or to something higher
than 11M. I have to set it to something less than 11M to be able to ping
the AP.
iwconfig shows a successful connection in both cases.
I am using Ubuntu 7.10 with vanilla kernel 2.6.24-rc7-git4 on AMD64
system with wpa_supplicant v0.5.8
