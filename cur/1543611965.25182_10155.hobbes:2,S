One of the things that I _think_ is happening is that lots of other
scripts/ files are being redone, and thus removing them from the list,
so in effect we're trading out one or two for just Python.

kbuild != CML2.  It all boils down to the current 'language' having no
real definitive spec, and having 3+ incompatible parsers.  We could
either try and tweak the language slightly (and probably make it even
harder on external parsers) or throw it out and try again.  ESR wrote
CML2 with a Python interpreter, so it uses Python.  The spec for CML2 is
out there, and there's even a CML2-in-C project.  If you don't want to
use Python, go help (I believe Greg Banks is who ESR mentioned is in
charge of it) that project out and then convince Linus to include it.

To carry this analogy out a bit more, the details on how to make a pen
exist, so if you don't like ESRs pen, go make your own.  That's why a
lot of people use Linux too.

The right tools for the right job.  C is good for the kernel.  Python is
good at manipulating strings.
