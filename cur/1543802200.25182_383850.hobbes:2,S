Odd, there should be more state between the 'Bad page'
and the backtrace.
    printk(KERN_EMERG "Bad page state in process '%s'\n"
		"page:%p flags:0x%0*lx mapping:%p mapcount:%d count:%d\n"
		"Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed\n"
Did you aggressively trim that, or did it for some
reason not get printed ?
