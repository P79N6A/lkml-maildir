By the way, I think the only relevant VM patches that went in between
2.6.8 and 2.6.9-rc2 are the following:
<nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
	[PATCH] vm: writeout watermark tuning
<nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
	[PATCH] vm: alloc_pages watermark fixes
<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] alloc_pages priority tuning
The first one shouldn't do much, and the last two should definitely
be improving things rather than anything else, because they cause
kswapd to properly start freeing in the background rather than force
the app to do the memory freeing itself.
This did expose a couple of bugs in kswapd, which were since fixed,
but are not in the 2.6.9-rc1-bk4 kernel.
So please, do the sysrq+m traces with a 2.6.10-rc3 kernel. Thanks.
