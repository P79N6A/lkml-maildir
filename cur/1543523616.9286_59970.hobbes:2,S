I do not know if your problem is the same, but I experience
difficulties with stale data staying in memory.
Consider the following script:
genromfs -a 512 -f flash.root.image -d proto
mount -t romfs -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 flash.root.image /mnt
silo -C /mnt/etc/silo.conf -J flash.total -i /mnt/boot/ieee32 \
 -b /mnt/boot/second.b
umount /mnt
It works only once. On the second time silo gets stale data.
My workaround is to add "cat /wad/mp3/*.mp3 > /dev/null"
right before the mount.
I talked to Alan and he says that somebody needs to do
ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF), presumably losetup. I have not tested
his suggestion yet.
