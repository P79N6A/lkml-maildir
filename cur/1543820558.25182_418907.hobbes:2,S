It looks to me that there is really no need to construct a linked list for
"unseen" likely/unlikely usage.  The information is already in the struct
"likeliness".  do_check_likely always increment one of the counter, so if
both count values are zero, you know it is "unseen" and can be skipped while
printing the profile.  So you can get rid of all that code by beefing up
seq_next().
