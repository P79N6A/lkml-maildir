C-states are something else entirely, frequency scaling and C-states are 
essentially independent. You can be in lower frequency and C1, C2, etc. 
and it will still use less power.

That's the easiest way, and that's what Fedora does for example (just 
compile all the drivers into the kernel). acpi-cpufreq should be the one 
for all modern boards, however.

The kernel will only use C2 and C3 if the motherboard exports support 
for it through ACPI. Most desktop boards don't, this is normally only 
found on laptops.
