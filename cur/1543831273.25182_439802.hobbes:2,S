I looked at it again, and it looks like gcc depends on the TLS ABI in 
order to pick the value of the cookie.  That makes it a potentially lot 
more cantankerous option; I would like to be able to support stack-smash 
checking in klibc, but if it means implementing TLS on all 
architectures, then that would really defeat the purpose (and we should 
add -fno-stack-protector to KLIBCREQFLAGS.)
Arjan: I see a few stack-protector-related have your name on it, do you 
have any details on implementation constraints for this across 
architectures?
