 *
 * user-triggered tracing.
 *
 * The -rt kernel has a built-in kernel tracer, which will trace
 * all kernel function calls (and a couple of special events as well),
 * by using a build-time gcc feature that instruments all kernel
 * functions.
 * 
 * The tracer is highly automated for a number of latency tracing purposes,
 * but it can also be switched into 'user-triggered' mode, which is a
 * half-automatic tracing mode where userspace apps start and stop the
 * tracer. This file shows a dumb example how to turn user-triggered
 * tracing on, and how to start/stop tracing. Note that if you do
 * multiple start/stop sequences, the kernel will do a maximum search
 * over their latencies, and will keep the trace of the largest latency
 * in /proc/latency_trace. The maximums are also reported to the kernel
 * log. (but can also be read from /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency)
 *
 * For the tracer to be activated, turn on CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING and
 * CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE in the .config, rebuild the kernel and boot
 * into it. Note that the tracer can have significant runtime overhead,
 * so you dont want to use it for performance testing :)
