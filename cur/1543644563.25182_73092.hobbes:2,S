I can understand that. However from a user point of view statistics are very 
usefull information, but not specifically the per-processor statistics.
I assume you mean to leave out the per-process statistics? Or do you mean to 
kmalloc the per-processor statistics when needed - that is: only when 
processes are running or maybe when the user has chosen to turn then on (some 
sysctl maybe)?
