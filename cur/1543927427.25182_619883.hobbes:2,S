The on_each_cpu is only used in the smp case.

flush_cpu_slab only flushes the local cpu slab. keventd threads are pinned 
to each processor so it should be safe.

If you have a fast cmpxchg_local then you can use that to implement fast 
cpu ops.

If we fail then we have done nothing....

Right.

No. c is invariant in respect to cpus.

C is not pointing to a specific cpu. It can only be used in CPU_xx ops to
address the currrent cpu.

__slab_free is always successful and will never cause a repeat of the 
loop.
