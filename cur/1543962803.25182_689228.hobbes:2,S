Hello thanks for the response, I'll have a look into that. The problem
I'm confronted with right now is the module is not going to
install due to it being a non-GPL module. After doing some reading I
was unawre that the kernel was going GPL-only in 2008, so with that in
mind I need to comply with the regulations. So the question I have now
is: Is there a module that is GPL approved that will give me 3D for
the macbook pro. And also recover from suspend?
regards;
