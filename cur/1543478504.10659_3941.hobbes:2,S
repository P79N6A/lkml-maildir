I'm getting oopses with 2.2.0pre7ac5. I tried to feed them to ksymoops,
as instructed by Documentation/oops-tracing.txt, but found I didn't
have bfd.h. I found out where to get bfd.h from ... but then I got
called away.
If this is a known problem, or my fault, feel free to send me an e-mail
and save me a bit of time. Thanks!
Edmund
(Yes, I think this particular oops came from an unmodified
2.2.0pre7ac5, but I was cooking dinner at the same time as applying
patches and compiling ...)
