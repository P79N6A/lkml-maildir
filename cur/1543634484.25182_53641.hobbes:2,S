There are other device classes beyond disks we need to do similar things
with that we ought to figure out at the same time. Examples off the top of
my head: disk (disk? cdaudio? dvd? cdrw?), sound (wave table? 3d?), v4l
(tuner? radio? mpeg?), net (wireless?).
One possibility is an "interfaces" file that lists the types of interfaces
that a device supports, possibly along with major:minor for that
interface. Then you can do find /devices -name interfaces | xargs grep
disk to locate your disks..
Another general question is how to fit "virtual" devices that aren't
associated with a bus into this scheme. For instance, PPP, VPNs, loopback
block devices, ramdisks, iSCSI, NBD. While you might argue that most of
these aren't really devices, iSCSI is every bit as "real" as a "local" FC
disk. And then you get into logical devices ala LVM and RAID..
