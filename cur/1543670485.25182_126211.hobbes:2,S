Ok.

http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/irqbalance/.
  We want to pull the

Ok, i booted with noriqbalance, removed nmi_watchdog=1 and ran irqbalance 0.06.
Now after few minutes of activity :
# cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1

and about 30 seconds later ( mail checking )

Is this what you are looking for ? and are the values changes meaningful ?
