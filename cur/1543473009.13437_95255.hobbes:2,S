Yes.  And Red Hat puts a fair amount of money back into Linux, paying Alan 
and others to develop it and develop for it (see, for example, 
http://www.labs.redhat.com
) --- how many more people would do Linux stuff if 
the need for a paying job didn't take away too much of their time?  That's 
my main problem at this point --- so it's not as if they're taking the money 
and running.
