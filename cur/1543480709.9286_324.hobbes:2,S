The fact of cross platform support is indeed not confusing.  
What I wnated to say is, if I go to the average guy and tell him,
 he will just not understand.  If I tell him, 'Linux runs on 
your PC and your friends Mac,' then he will understand. If I 
tell him 'Linux runs on PC, PowerMac, UltraSparc, Alpha, ARM, 
...' then he will just stop to listen anymore (or read an 
article).
When I meat my friends who do 'suit jobs' like marketing and try 
to tell them, they will not listen after the first word they do 
not grasp.  The press release has to be as easy to understand as 
possible (That does not count the use of buzzwords --- but that 
is an entirely other story with those businessmen).
regards,
Robert
