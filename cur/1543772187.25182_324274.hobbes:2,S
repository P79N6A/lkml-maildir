I'll look this up but it sounds very weird and I don't see how this
would happen with this change.

Yeah but for capabilities to be useful it needs to be recursive too, ie.
Alice runs Bob that in turn runs Joe. Joe should now have the
capabilities that Alice had if Alice had set PCRTL_ACROSS_EXECVE and Bob
did not drop the PRCTL flag nor zeroed the inheritable mask.

That would require Alice to already have the capabilities. No extra
capabilities are gained by exec'ing, it's only about inheriting the
existing ones.
