yes, we are not yet strict enough in the 'wakeup message' passing. I
thought about setting cpu_curr in reschedule_idle() already, [being able
to do such 'deferred' things was the point in cpu_curr] but i just
chickened out for now. I'll send a patch for this (and other things like
the SCHED_YIELD stuff) to people to test this out.

yes, 'high frequency rescheduling' still might fool the current scheduler.

well spotted. This is rather easy to fix with a recalculation counter,
since the recalculation code is outline already. Or, there was code posted
yesterday that sets per-process recalculation timestamps as they leave and
enter the runqueue. While it certainly increases add/del_runqueue costs,
it doesnt have all these nasty side-effects.

yes this is historical code, the outer loop is not needed anymore.
