I am working on an updated patch to 2.5.70 to incorporate the comments from you and Jeff Garzik. Regarding the variable renaming of irq, I am open to any suggestions. Please make a recommendation and I will incorporate it into the next update.  Regarding platform_legacy_irq, I have not seen an edge-triggered interrupt failure caused by platform_legacy_irq.

Actually we can simply use;
for (i = 0; i < (NR_VECTORS - FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR); i++) {
	vector = ...
	if (i >= NR_IRQS)
		break;
	...
	set_intr_gate(vector, interrupt[i]);
}

I agree.

Good question, i wouldn't think so, that would collapse that section into 
two lines.

Yes some of them are a bit easy to botch up later on.. like the following 
excerpt.
