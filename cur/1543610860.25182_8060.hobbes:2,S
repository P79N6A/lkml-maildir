The ability to possibly dramatically improve performance by allowing 
more than one or two tracks to be write cached at once.
Yes, in theory, the system should be able to elevator all seeks, but
it may not know that track 400 has really been remapped to 200, the
drive does.
With write-caching on, the system doesn't know where the head is, 
the drive does.
And, it's nearly free (an extra meg of space)

You simply pick another track for the journal, the same as you would
if an ordinary track goes bad.
(it's tested on boot)
The waste of disk space is utterly trivial.
A meg in drives where the entry level is 40G?
