I've hit the problem, found this thread, found the proposed patch and
tried it. Presumably others did the same. It's not easy to report a
hang which leaves no message in the logs and happens at random,
infrequent times. It takes time to gather enough information to make a
useful report. And it takes time to make sure that the patch actually
fixed the problem, too.
(Satyam's estimation that everybody would hit the bug within an hour
doesn't match my experience, I had "only" 2 freezes in 60 hours or so.)

The fix appears to be in the tree already, so you needn't worry.
