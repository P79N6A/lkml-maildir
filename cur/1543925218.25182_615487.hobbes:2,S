No, it wasn't, I diffed it against -rc1. I tested the Kconfig changes
with "make ARCH=x86_64 menuconfig" and "make ARCH=i386 menuconfig". As
far as I understand, the new x86 arch depends on being called as
ARCH=i386 or ARCH=x86_64. I may have misunderstood how the x86
architecture works but hoped Rafael would know more and tell me if I was
wrong.
