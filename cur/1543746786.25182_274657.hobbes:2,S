Yep, very interested.  So, "serving IMAP from Maildirs" - from
the filesystems perspective, can you describe that in detail for
me?  I would guess that means a shallow directory tree, with quite
large directories (how large?) and many (how many?) small files?
(how small on average?)  How frequently are files added/removed?
Is this easily reproducible for you?  If so, can you send me
enough details that I can try to reproduce it locally?
thanks.
