This is targeted at the bottom of the range that Linux supports, ie
less than 32MB. I originally tested it with _2MB_.
This allocator's performance is linear in the number of
smaller-than-a-page memory fragments (page-sized fragments get
coalesced and handed back to the buddy allocator). When you've only
got 4MB, scanning through all those fragments doesn't take long. When
you've got 400MB, and a lot of fragmentation, it can be very slow
indeed. SLAB, on the other hand, is nearly O(1).
