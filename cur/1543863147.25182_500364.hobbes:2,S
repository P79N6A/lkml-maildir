this is a ... funny way of achieving this
if an application for some reason wants some fixed address for a piece
of memory there are other ways to do that.... (but to some degree all
apps that can't take randomization broken; for example a glibc upgrade
on a system will also move the address space around by virtue of being
bigger or smaller etc etc)

got a URL to this? If this is exploiting the fact that the vdso is at a
fixed spot... it's no longer the case since quite a while.
