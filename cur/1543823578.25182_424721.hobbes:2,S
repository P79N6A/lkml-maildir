(Hmm.  The intent is more clear, ie reserve the top for low latency
tasks,... but that sounds a bit like xmms protection.) 
The main problem I see with this ceiling, solely from the interactivity
viewpoint, is that interactive tasks which have started burning cpu
and/or freshly forked interactive tasks land in the same spot.  Thud.c
demonstrates this problem quite well.  You don't want a few copies of
thud in the same queue with your interactive task, much less above it if
it's used enough cpu to drop a notch or two.  Much pain ensues.
