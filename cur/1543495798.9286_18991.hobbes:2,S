Looks like a change somewhere in the mailing list handling triggered a
spam killer. My kernel mail is now arriving with a X-UIDL: header. This
has caused all arriving linux-kernel mail to be tossed into the
(recoverable) spam bucket. SMTP mail should not have this header. Is one
of the list exploders collecting mail via POP3?
