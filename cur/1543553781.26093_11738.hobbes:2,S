	The program does not work. A program works if it does what it's supposed to
do. If you want to argue that this program is supposed to print "ffffff"
then explain to me why the 'malloc' contains a zero in parenthesis.
	The program can't possibly work because it invokes undefined behavior. It
is impossible to determine what a program that invokes undefined behavior is
'supposed to do'.
