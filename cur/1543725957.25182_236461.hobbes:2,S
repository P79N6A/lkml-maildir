Agreed, this was discussed earlier and shouldn't be too hard to work into
the current MSI code. Something akin to arrays of msi_desc indexed by
irq handling node depending on the source irq/bus information.

We can do this right now using the topology information, it's been done
before on NUMAQ.

Ok, some of those really are vectors, the thing is, for irqs > 15 (non
legacy) we pass the real vector around. This is done by setting
pci_dev->irq the vector assigned to that irq line. It can get quite
confusing in places so variable naming is indeed important. But in
general, on i386, all irqs with CONFIG_PCI_MSI are vectors.
