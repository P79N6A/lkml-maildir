Hi Mike,
IMO d->d_inode is not expected to be NULL at this point. The only
place it can become NULL is in d_delete(d) call, but as the dentry ref.
count will be atleast 2, even this will not make d_inode NULL and it should
only unhash the dentry. Probably it will become more clear if you post
the oops message.
Mean while, I think kobject_del should not remove corresponding sysfs directory
until all the other references to kobject has gone. There can be references
taken in sysfs_open_file() from user space. The following patch moves the  
sysfs_remove_dir() call, to kobject_cleanup() and I think it may solve your 
problem also. It will be nice if you can test it.
Pat, what do you think about the below patch?
Thanks
Maneesh
o kobject_del should not remove the corresponding sysfs directory untill all
  other references to kobject are gone for example references taken from 
  userspace programs doing sysfs_open_file(). Moving sysfs_remove_dir to 
  kobject_cleanup.
