Gamin is a API/ABI stable replacement for FAM. Just dropping in gamin
instead of fam should just work with all current software. Inotify does
not have the umount blocking problem. In fact it lets FAM/Gamin no that
a particular directory has been unmounted and is no longer available.
This will let konquerer/nautilus provide more user friendly clues to
users.
