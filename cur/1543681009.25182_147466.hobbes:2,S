It is not neither better nor worse. For sure it is more close to what
existing apps do, and it is easier to understand.

Even if it is true that you can drop an extra read(), having the RDHUP
event will cost exactly zero extra CPU cycles inside the kernel, and one
changed line of code (plus arch definitions in asm/poll.h). To me, it
looks acceptable. Let's see what DaveM think about it.
