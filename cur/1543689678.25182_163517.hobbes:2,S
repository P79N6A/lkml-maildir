Up through 2.05, ACPI crashed the kernel during boot(2.4 and 2.6) -
I posted here about that...  I'm going to try this weekend with
the just flashed 2.06 - even though the changelog doesn't indicate
anything changed wrt ACPI.
The problem was, iirc, was scanning one of the tables - I can't find
the message now :(
APM works on 2.4, but not 2.6
