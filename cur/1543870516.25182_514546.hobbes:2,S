About memory-hot-unplug, I'm now writing a new patch-set for memory-unplug for
showing my overview and roadmap. I'm now debugging it. I think I will be able to
post them as RFC in a week.
At least, ZONE_MOVABLE(or something partitioning memory) is necessary for
memory-hot-unplug like DIMM-poweroff. (I'm now using my own ZONE_MOVABLE patch, but
It is O.K. to migrate to Mel's one if it's ready to be merged.)

Hmm...software-zone seems attractive.
I remember someone posted pesuedo-zone(pzone) patch in past.
