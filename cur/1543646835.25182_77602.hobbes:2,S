That depends how specialized the hardware actually is. I think I've see
six different non free implementations of 68360 sync serial code around
all proprietary for example.
Also my original comments were much more aimed at the core stuff. People
who made existing and especially core stuff smaller could send the stuff
out. Several of us want to compile a CONFIG_TINY option, and suprisingly
enough small is good on high end boxes. My L1 cache is 8 times faster
than my L2 cache is 7 times faster than my memory. Or to put it another
way, going to main memory costs me maybe 100 instructions.
My Athlon thinks small is good too!
