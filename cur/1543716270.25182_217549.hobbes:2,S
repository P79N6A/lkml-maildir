I do not think the allegations are unsubstantiated or unfair; on the
contrary, people have identified with specificity what is offensive
and probably illegal.  Might I remind you of 17 USC 1201(b)(1):
    No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide,
    or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device,
    component, or part thereof, that -
(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
    protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively
    protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work
    or a portion thereof;
(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other
    than to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure
    that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this
    title in a work or a portion thereof; or
(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that
    person with that person's knowledge for use in circumventing
    protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively
    protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work
    or a portion thereof.
Issuing the taint warning when a derivative work is created is a right
of the copyright owner(s); you have explained the embedded \0 as a
"mere" technical measure designed to circumvent the taint warning.  In
my reading, that qualifies it as a violation of the paragraph above.
Part or all of 12 USC 1202 may also apply for similar reasons.
The DMCA may be unpopular, but it is still law.
