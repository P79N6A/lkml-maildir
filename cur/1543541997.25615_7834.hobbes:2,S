So, do you think the input layer is a good solution generally?
Should PC keyboards and mice go through it, for example?
Or is it unnecessary extra complication?
There is a push on to make ADB keyboards and mice go through the input
layer in the PPC port, but no-one has explained to me what we would
gain from that.
