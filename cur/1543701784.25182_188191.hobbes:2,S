If you use this tree, please consider dropping me a note or whatever;
I don't like to work in a vacuum...
The way I've built this, in case anybody's curious:
- undo all the changes in 2.6.0-mm2 but not in 2.6.1-rc1-mm1.
- merge with 2.6.1-rc1, resolved nine conflicts.
- Apply all patches in 2.6.1-rc1-mm2 but not in 2.6.0-mm2.
  Some didn't apply fully, for whatever reason.
- Generate a diff between 2.6.1-rc1 and top-of-tree.
  Use interdiff -p1 to compare that to Andrew's official patch.
  (There were none, which was somewhat surprising.)
Oh yes, I've stopped prefixing the patch tags with mm[12]; that would get
too confusing in the long run.
