That's very strange.  It would be helpful if you could gather:
  1. strace of the server, both working and broken
  2. a "tcpdump -nvv" of its udp traffic (ideally captured from a seperate
     server, but from the server would probably be OK too)
Most of the discussion of this change was on the netdev mailing list, it
would probably be best to send this information there.
