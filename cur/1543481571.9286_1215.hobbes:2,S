Don't know if this counts... depends on how many people out there are
using 3c905B Cyclone cards...
The 3c509 update that went in in 2.2.0-pre6 is giving me trouble.
Specifically, it seems to be causing NFS (and any other high-bandwidth
app, like f.e. scp) to suck eggs.
Running "strace cat big-file-on-irix6.5-nfs-server > /dev/null" shows
bursts of 19 successful 4096-byte reads, between which the process sleeps
for 1-8 seconds in a read call.  That 19 is _very_ consistent.
Running ifconfig shows the interface reporting errors at a rate of roughly
one per second when the network is under load.  After a few minutes:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:10:4B:0D:F8:E5  
          inet addr:128.197.14.46  Bcast:128.197.14.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:6380 errors:193 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:194
          TX packets:1716 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0 
          Interrupt:17 Base address:0xe400 
Compare this with stressing it for <30secs under pre5:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:10:4B:0D:F8:E5  
          inet addr:128.197.14.46  Bcast:128.197.14.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:16902 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:5667 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:2
          Collisions:14 
          Interrupt:17 Base address:0xe400

These problems are consistent across pre6-7-8-9.
In case it matters, the system is a dual-PII and I'm on a 100Mb switch.
Sorry this took a few days to report - the problem only became apparent
when I started doing high-bandwidth stuff over NFS, and I have been too
busy teaching and doing linux propoganda[1] to properly isolate the
problem until today.
