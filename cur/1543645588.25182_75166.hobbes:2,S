I can look after that for you.  But I'd prefer that you just add the
extra gfp_flags argument to get_vm_area() and update the 16 callers.
You cannot call get_vm_area() from interrupt context at present;
it does write_lock(&vmlist_lock) unsafely.
It would be a bit sad to make vmlist_lock interrupt-safe for this.  Is
there no alternative?
(And what the hell is arch/alpha/mm/init.c:callback_init() doing rewriting
vmlist?  Somebody shoot that code)
