I could do that. Usually the actual mm changes have been
a pretty small set of this. Often only 1 or 2 patches.

This is specifically for review and inclusion in main line.

Well, if any non-mmu architecture people sent me patches that
made sense for me to push upstream I would include them here.
But that doesn't happen very often. They generally do it
themselves.
Historically the first -uc patches had m68knommu, h8300 and v850
as well as the non-mmu changes in it.

The problem is on systems that have RAM mapped at high physical
addresses. TASK_SIZE may well be a numerically smaller number
than the address range that RAM sits in. So this test fails when
it shouldn't.
