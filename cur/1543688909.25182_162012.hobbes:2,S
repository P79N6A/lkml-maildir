You might want to check the FAQs for info on "SCSI disconnect" support. 
Most modern SCSI tape drives support this, but without any configuration 
details on the tape drive or the host adapter, it's hard to say whether 
it will work for you.
Chances are that more people will have answers on one of the 
SCSI-specific lists.
