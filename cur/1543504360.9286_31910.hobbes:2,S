Don't you think that this should be the purpose of the CLONE_PID flag ?
With this flag, all system calls returning the current pid would return
the pid of the last clone() call without this flag set, except getpid()
(in order to get a standard way to get the actual kernel pid of a
CLONE_PID thread, and because this could be hidden by the libpthread).
