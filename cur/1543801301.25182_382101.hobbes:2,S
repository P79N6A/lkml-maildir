Yes. And it's nice even when unconditional branches are effectively free, 
because it can avoid an unnecessary cache miss just to fetch the 
unnecessary branch (which very much _can_ happen, since the failure 
function will sleep).
Of course, the thing to look out for is to never get the call-return stack 
messed up, but this kind of regular tail-call doesn't have that issue.
