Well, what can I do with that number? Your patches must provide some sort 
of benefit when we have that number. I'm currently trying to find out, 
what happens after we have this number, so I would be really grateful, if 
you would answer my questions:
How are these disks registered and how will the dev_t number look like?
How will the user know about these numbers?
Who creates these device entries (user or daemon)?
SCSI has multiple majors, disks 0-15 are at major 8, disks 16-31 are at
65, ...., disks 112-127 are at major 71. Will this stay the same? Where
are the disk 128-xxx?
Can I have now more than 15 partitions?
bye, Roman
