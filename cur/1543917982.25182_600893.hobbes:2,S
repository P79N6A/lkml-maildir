Subject: [PATCH 3/3] UML - Definitively kill subprocesses on panic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Lepton Wu <ytht.net@gmail.com>
  In a stock 2.6.22.6 kernel, poweroff a user mode linux guest
(2.6.22.6 running in skas0 mode) will halt the host linux. I
think the reason is the kernel thread abort because of a bug.
Then the sys_reboot in process of user mode linux guest is
not trapped by the user mode linux kernel and is executed by host.
  I think it is better to make sure all of our children process
to quit when user mode linux kernel abort.
[ jdike - the kernel process needs to ignore SIGTERM, plus the
  waitpid/kill loop is needed to make sure that all of our children
  are dead before the kernel exits ]
