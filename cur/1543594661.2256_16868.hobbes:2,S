Use spinlocks instead of global cli. Global cli can take milliseconds.

Reread it. It says 'after operation with ss' - that is after
"mov xxxx,%ss" or "pop %ss", as it is expected that next instruction 
will be "movl yyyy,%esp". 
Before "lss ...." (it is lss in intel mnemonic...) was invented, you 
could not switch your stack safely without this feature, as NMI could 
arrive in the middle of your stack switch without blocking all interrupts 
after "mov xxxx,%ss". 
BTW, if you chain "mov %eax,%ss" back to back, they are executed
in pairs - irq can arrive after even mov, but cannot after odd (at
least on PII and PIII). But it is a bit off topic for L-K (except that 
we can try other clones, maybe someone got it wrong?)
