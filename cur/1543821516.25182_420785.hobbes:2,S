Jon stop being so dramatic, this is just like letting userspace map
the BARs, without ownership through sysfs, which is a good thing, you
can still map /dev/mem, look we have lots of ways to shoot ourselves
in the foot, if we *want* to.

Again we can already bypass device drivers.... so don't worry so much....
This attribute allows us to enable devices that X otherwise would hand
enable, that's all, it doesn't allow a user with vi to do it ....

Again we have lots of ways for this to happen...
Now X is stupid don't get me wrong and sorry Bjorn it might still
enable/disable devices it doesn't use (unless configured with some
arcania in xorg.conf), but this at least is step 1, this should allow
me to remove all the PCI BAR modfiying code from the Linux code paths,
and to be honest that is a very good start, we still need some sort of
VGA arbitration (which is why X actually messes with cards it doesn't
know about, as it has to make sure everyone isn't decoding the VGA
IOs...)
