Yes.

I may miss something, but I don't think there is a need for that.
Currently, futex_requeue is (only) used in pthread_cond_broadcast to requeue 
some threads from an internal futex (futex1) to another futex (futex2, which is 
the futex behind the cond_mutex)
futex1 does not need to be a PI-futex, I think.
