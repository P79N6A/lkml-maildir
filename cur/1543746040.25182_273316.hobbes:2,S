Just made some test-runs with RT-V0.7.30-2, with my jackd-R + 8*fluidsynth
benchmark on my laptop (P4/UP), and the results don't seem to be eligible
to the hall of fame, at least when compared with RT-0.7.7 as the ones I
last posted here a few weeks ago.
I hate to say this, but the XRUN rate has increased since RT-0.7.7, and
the maximum scheduling delay reported by jackd has also degraded to 1000
usecs (was around 600 usecs).
Please note that this is not unique to latest RT-V0.7.30-2, but also
applies to each one of the previous iterations I've been testing, only not
reported until now. Again, all test conditions were kept the same
(hardware, jackd, alsa), only the kernel has changed (obviously).
OTOH, there's another thing: I don't seem to be able to build an initrd
image under the latest RT kernels. Something related to the loopback
device. When trying to run mkinitrd it stalls, somewhere under this
process:
  mount -t ext2 /root/tmp/initrd.img /root/tmp/initrd.mnt -o loop
This happens on my laptop (P4/UP, Mandrake 10.1c) but not on my desktop
(P4/SMT, SUSE 9.2pro). Speaking of which, the lockups experienced while
unloading the ALSA modules seems to be over, at least as far as I could
try with RT-V0.7.29-4 (probably not enough yet).
Bye now.
