Hello Pierre,
this should go to 2.6.21, I have hold this for some
months and I have discussed it in the thread
"Re: CRC Errors with SD cards in 4bits mode (on i.MXl)"
You have been CCed. This is not solution for seen data CRC
problem, but solves problems with recognition of cards
which has been timing sensitive sometimes.
I have sent it into Russell's patch queue with my others
MX1 fixes I have intended to be included in 2.6.21.
It was probably mistake for this one, because it should
go through your tree. If you send it to mainline
yourself, I would discard patch from patch daemon.
We have spoken about MX1 SDHC maintainership.
I am attaching my subscription.
I am not sure about mailing list field there.
Do you suggest this one, ALKML or other?
Best wishes
              Pavel Pisa

bugs and coordination of the fighting against problems
of this hardware beast.
