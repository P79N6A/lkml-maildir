No, you're right, we can just look up the cpu once. Which makes Andrew's 
argument that "probe_kernel_address()" isn't in any hot path even more 
true.

Why? That would fall out of the 
	if (lock->owner != thread)
		break;
part. We don't actually care that it only happens once: this all has 
_known_ races, and the "cpu_relax()" is a barrier.
And notice how the _caller_ handles the "owner == NULL" case by not even 
calling this, and looping over just the state in the lock itself. That was 
in the earlier emails. So this approach is actually pretty different from 
the case that depended on the whole spinlock thing.
