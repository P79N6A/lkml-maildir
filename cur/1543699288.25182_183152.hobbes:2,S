Are you calling a user-configured (not user-patched) kernel "customized" or
not?
_The_ top reason (at least when reading Al's posts :-) is probably that the
source is cross-checked by many eyes. If you create a infinite number of
patched kernel-versions it is obvious you will loose this primary advantage.
The more versions the fewer cross-checking.
IOW a "customized" but instable OS values exactly zero.

"Serious" is a subjective argument, therefore different people see different
issues as serious. In my opinion a kernel.org kernel should cover most if not
all possible stable customizations, see it as a pool.
So my primary question for inclusion would not be "what is it worth?" but "does
it do any harm?". I am not god, therefore I do not and can not judge 
"worthness". Can you?
