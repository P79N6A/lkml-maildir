I have a silly question.  I just upgraded my RH system to 6.0.  Of
course, I'd already been well beyond 2.2.5 by then, so I kept my current
kernel.  Now, with 2.2.7 and 2.2.8, when I boot, I get a message
repeated several times to the effect that /boot/System.map doesn't match
the kernel version.  Is that bad, and is there a way to fix it?
