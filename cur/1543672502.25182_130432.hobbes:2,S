Yes, the KJ list has already seen this patch and commented on some version
of it.
Folks, IMO for KJ work to be successful (merged) and rewarding, and for it
to continue, we need:
- TODO list updated with accurate descriptions of problems and expected
  changes to fix them;
- a plan of attack for getting them merged;
We shouldn't just expect (for example) Gabriel's patch to be merged
on its own.
Even if Gabriel's patch is perfect, I don't expect that Linus will merge it,
esp. not now, but not even earlier in 2.5 days.  For one thing, it's
176 KB, so it needs to be broken down by subsystem/driver/filesystem/etc.
Then it needs some exposure, like living in -ac or -mm or -pick1,
or at least some testing (everyday usage) by a few people, with reports
from them.
And I don't really want to review a 176 KB patch (although I did already
look over most of it a few days ago).  Do people want to take portions
of it for review and then see about Alan merging it, e.g.?
