Ok, reverting the same 4 patches as suggested to Rafael J. Wysocki
restores the correct behaviour:
pm-add-state-field-to-pm_message_t-to-hold-actual.patch
pm-respect-the-actual-device-power-states-in-sysfs.patch
pm-minor-updates-to-core-suspend-resume-functions.patch
pm-make-pci_choose_state-use-the-real-device.patch
Are they indipendent? Would you want me to track the exact one
introducing the bug?
