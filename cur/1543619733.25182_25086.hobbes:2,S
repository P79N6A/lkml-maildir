The machine is reporting that the cache is enabled.  Even if this was
true, I have trouble believing that turning on the cache would result in a
50,000% increase in speed (4 bogomips compared to 500).
I have a feeling that I'm going to have to chalk this one up to hardware
failure.  Another kind soul suggested it could be ECC memory reporting a
continual string of 1 bit failures.
