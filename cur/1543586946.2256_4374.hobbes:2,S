patching kernel 2.4.3 in /usr/src/linux
cd /usr/src
bunzip2 -c ~/kpatch/patch-2.4.4-pre1.bz2 | patch -p0 -E
as I have done hundreds of times.
tons of failed hunks and previously applied patches.
I can patch my backup of 2.4.0 -> 2.4.1 -> 2.4.2 -> 2.4.3 with no
problem.
Please cc me as I can only read the archives.
