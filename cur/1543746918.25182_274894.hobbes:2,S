Speaking of more explicit, there are various asm-ARCH header
files that do or do not hide (via __KERNEL__) interfaces
such as:	get_unaligned()
and the atomic operations.
So are these Linux kernel exported APIs, or do they belong
in some library?
We'll need to decide on a consistent remedy for these,
and such changes could be made at any time IMO (i.e., soon).
