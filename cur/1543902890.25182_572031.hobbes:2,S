If the WARN_ON doesn't trigger, I cannot see how my patch would affect
your system.
 -	IF we enter the if() branch in poll_napi, then the following
	must hold:
	 -	an interrupt from the e1000 arrived
	 -	e1000_intr disables interrupts, increments irq_sem
		(which is now 1) and schedules rx_action
 -	Now, inside poll_napi, the following happens:
	 -	poll_napi is called, finds the device is marked for
		polling, invokes dev->poll
	 -	dev->poll calls netif_rx_complete (which does *not*
		remove the device from the poll list), and re-enables
		interrupts. irq_sem is now 0.
 -	Finally, the rx_action softirq is run, which calls dev->poll
	again, which ends up invoking netif_rx_complete once more,
	and tries to re-enable interrupts. The latter doesn't do
	anything except decrementing irq_sem once more, which now
	goes negative.
	Which would trigger the WARN_ON.
Now, as you say the WARN_ON is never triggered, it follows that
we never end up in the if() branch of poll_napi. But that is
where the only substantial modification of my patch is.
Here's a somewhat drastic modification that should not change any
timing, but just verifies whether my patch is to blame at all. Can
you give it a try?
Thanks,
Olaf
