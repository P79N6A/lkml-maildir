My enthusiasm for making even the slightest change (ud2 Ap) to the
various disassemblers has waned over the weekend.  Particularly a
change that would require objdump to know whether and what version
of kernel it was dealing with.  And it seems to be an issue which
worries only me.
So I retract my earlier patch, and won't attempt to persuade Marcelo
to include it (or the one below) in 2.4.19: it was good for minimizing
change to the disassemblers, but no good for avoiding change to them.
Personally, I'll use some patch like the one below: waste another
byte to encapsulate the file pointer and line number in an ljmp.
