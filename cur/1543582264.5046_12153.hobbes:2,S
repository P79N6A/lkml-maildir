Are you sure about that ?
Try this:
a.h:
#define hello printf("%d at %s\n",__LINE__,__FILE__)
a.c:
#include <stdio.h>
#include "a.h"
int main()
{
    hello;
    hello;
    return 0;
}
werewolf:~/ko> gcc a.c -o a
werewolf:~/ko> a
6 at a.c
7 at a.c
(line changes, and name is .c)
because __FILE__ and __LINE__ are expanded with respect to the current
SOURCE file (see info cpp), not header file.
As I said before, my choose would be the __func__ + __LINE__ predefined macros.
I would prefer to see 'bug in my_buggy_device_init(), line 42'. And you can
even drop the __LINE__ part.
