You are twisting words.  I may have said that replication provides a
point-in-time copy of a volume, which is exactly what it does, no more,
no less.

A big buffer cache does not provide a guarantee that the dirty cache
data saved to disk when line power is lost.  If you would like to
add that feature to the Linux buffer cache, then please do it, or make
whichever other contribution you wish to make.  If you just want to
explain to me one more time that Linux, batteries, whatever, cannot
be relied on, then please do not include me in the CC list.
