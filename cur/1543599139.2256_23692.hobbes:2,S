absolutely right, but I think that when it was
designed
(sun? cisco?), it was primarily intended as many hosts
to one (server, router or switch). A file server, a
router or even a firewall can easily balance their
load
when they are connected to several tens of
workstations. If your concern is really for peer to
peer, then Andy's method is better as long as other
hashing methods have not been implemented in the
bonding code.

it may be one day, but at the moment, it's designed to
be compatible with other equipments which use it too.
