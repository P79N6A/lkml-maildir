Thanks for asking these precise questions.  After double-checking
everything I found a typo in my configuration that changes things a bit.
I repeated some tests and the correct answers are now:
* 2.6.10 vanilla		works
* 2.6.10-ac8			works
* 2.6.10-ac11			does not work
* 2.6.11 vanilla		does not work
* 2.6.11 w/o promise.patch	does not work
* 2.6.11 + 2.6.10 libata	works!
This looks much more consistent to me but brings the case back to
libata.
