I also noticed many times that gcc's optimization of "if (complex condition)"
is rather poor and it's often better to put it in a variable before. I even
remember that if you use an intermediate variable, it can often generate a
CMOV instruction on processors which support it, while it produces cond tests
and jumps without the variable. Generally speaking, if you want fast code,
you have to write it as a long sequence of small instructions, just as if
you were writing assembly. As you said, shocking but true.
BTW, cheers for your optimizations !

Willy
