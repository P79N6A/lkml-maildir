Hmm... Well, I haven't succeeded in hanging 2.2.x this way... So the 
hardware, (while likely flakey) works...
I'll try out another amd system of similar vintage (whose mb make I know! 
;-), and see if I can't find anything more helpful/generic... (as well as 
give speicifc mb info for this system, since it seems to be hw specific) I 
was going to put 2.4 on it anyways, eventually... In the meantime, well, who 
uses floppies, anyways? :-)
I really wish I knew enough about the kernel/fd and my c were good enough I 
could do something more constructive... I feel mildly guilty promising to do 
my best to expose someone else's bug... :-)
Best wishes,
C. D. Thompson-Walsh
