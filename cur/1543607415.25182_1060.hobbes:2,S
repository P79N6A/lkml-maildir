Subject: old bug in sym53c8xx still lurks in 2.2.20pre

Gerard Roudier posted at the beginning of an April a fix to a queue
handling in that driver which seems to be forgotten.  I was looking
through 2.2.20pre and found that the bug is still there.
There are two things about the bug - it may actually hit (some got it
while running cdparanoia) and if you look closer at the original code
you will see that it is quite suspicious. :-)
Here it is again the fix as posted by Gerard re-diffed against
2.2.19something sources.  It still applies cleanly to 2.2.20pre11.

Hm, I should possibly check the latest 2.4s as well.
