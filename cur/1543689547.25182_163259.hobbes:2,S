If i didn't know better I would say you haven't even tried linux. Joe 
User doesn't have to recompile anything. If the distribution he is using 
is any good (and most are) there is no need to recompile anything, it's 
already there as a module.

Most kernel developers don't get paid for what they do, they do it for 
fun and prestige. Reaching "the masses" isn't necessary the goal.
