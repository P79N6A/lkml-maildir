fortuneately I got a newer bios version which now supports my 40GB disk.

WARNING: this doesn't work for all bios versions !!!
for my old DFI bios version, it was _not_ possible to start the system
even if I've specified <32GB disk size as user settings in the bios setup.
a recent article of german magazine c't tells the same:  using bios user setting
below 32GB as workaround to start/boot with 40GB disks only works for some bios versions, 
not for all main boards (as my DFI board has prooven:(
