Ok you do have a point there. The GPT users win of course, since it
uses LBA, not cyls, so the number of lost bytes is generally below
a cyl.
On the other hand, the H and S of CHS could be lowered and S increased,
e.g. divide H by 2, divide S by 2, multiply S by 4. This gives a finer
bytes/cylinder granularity.

Well it was designed for a different system initially with
a different style of booting.
