I think 80 is good.  What the specific number is does not matter much, we all have 
screens wider than 80 characters.  The point is just to have a number that prevents 
really long lines and prevents people from indenting too many levels past our minds 
ability to keep up.  We've already all been coding to 80, and it happens to be a nice 
round number we can all remember and love.  The only reason I see to select 79 is 
that prime numbers are generally cooler than other numbers.
