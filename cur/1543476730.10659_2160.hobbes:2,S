I can confirm its the case for the EMU10K. I have been told they will
not be releasing info except under NDA for binary only drivers (ie if you
made the mistake of buying one you can buy the commercial OSS product for
it one day). 
Creative have since claimed its because they are under NDA from the makers
of the EMU10K. And another poster has pointed out the people they are 
"under NDA from" they own. Yeah right guys. Someone has been taking lessons
from ATI.
Creative have also refused to release info on their DVD board, although in
this case it does appear that they are genuinely trapped themselves by third
party NDA's (From CCube).

Full duplex yes, wavetable I don't have any experience on. USB sound has
a published standardised API too which will be a godsend to everyone (including
vendors who don't want to reveal their internals) but USB sound for Linux is
a fair way off right now
