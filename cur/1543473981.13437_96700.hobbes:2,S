Hello....
where say you need glibc????

Current Minimal Requirements
****************************
   Upgrade to at *least* these software revisions before thinking you've
encountered a bug!  If you're unsure what version you're currently
running, the suggested command should tell you.
- Kernel modules         2.1.121                 ; insmod -V
- Gnu C                  2.7.2.3                 ; gcc --version
- Binutils               2.8.1.0.23              ; ld -v
- Linux libc5 C Library  5.4.46                  ; ls -l /lib/libc.so.*
- Dynamic Linker (ld.so) 1.9.9                   ; ldd --version or ldd -v
-cut here-
so???
please, check your system, you have a linker problem, not a libc problem,
did you patch yout kernel in ther right way?
try something like this....
zcat patch-2.2.0.preX | patch -p0
in the upper level directory of you linux kernel source....
i only found one reference to glibc in the doc..

Please make sure you don't install ld.so-2.x unless you're running
glibc2 / libc6.
-cut here-
like i said... a linker problem....
you don't need glibc to compile the kernel... if you like it great... but
not necesary... just if you like the Unix /dev/pts support (very very
util)...
however the libc-6.1 can do the task (i believe it >;-)
I'am compiling it in my slackware box whitout problems...
problems???.. go back to the stable kernels  :)   ...
by.....
ahhhh, Happy new year for all the Linux kernel hackers...
