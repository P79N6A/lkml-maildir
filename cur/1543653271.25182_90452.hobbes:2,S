As long as people most people make use of 'obj', this
will be a good thing.
I would be tempted to go the read(), read64() route on this. It makes
everything a mess, but it probably means a more efficient
implementation.

If you can guarantee that epoll will always be compatible with poll() in
terms of objects that can be watched, and events that can be watched, I
would lean towards your preference. If this guarantee cannot be made, I
would lean toward Ulrich's preference.
