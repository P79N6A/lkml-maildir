We in fact tried to do this and for good reason. Our nameserver sofware gets
great benefit when two processes listen to the same socket on an SMP system.
In some cases, this means 70% more packets/second, which is close to the
theoretical maximum beneft.
We would heavily prefer to have two *threads* listening to the same socket
instead of to processes. The two processes do not share caching information
now because that expects to live in the same memory.
Right now, we can't do that because of very weird locking behaviour, which
is documented here: 
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Linux.html
 and leads to
250.000 context switches/second and dysmal peformance.
I expect NPTL to fix this situation and I would just love to be able to call
select() or poll() or recvfrom() on the same fd(s) from different threads.
