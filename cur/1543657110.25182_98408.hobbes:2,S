Only in cpufreq_set(). If that is called with cpu==CPUFREQ_ALL_CPUS, this
value can't be passed to cpufreq_set_policy any more. So the
cpufreq_set_policy call needs to be iterated over all cpus. The reason for
this is that on some architectures, not all CPUs support the same frequency
ranges.
In all other instances, CPUFREQ_ALL_CPUS is removed by that patch you're
commenting on; will re-send it soon for 2.5.53.
