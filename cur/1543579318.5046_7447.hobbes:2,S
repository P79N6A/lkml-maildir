It was my intention to post IIRC numbers for small thread counts today.
However, the benchmark (not the system) seems to hang on occasion.  This
occurs on both the unmodified 2.4.0 kernel and the one which contains
my multi-queue patch.  Therefore, I'm pretty sure it is not something
I did. :)
Anyone else see anything like this before?  I'll look into the reason
for the hang, but it will delay my posting of these numbers.
