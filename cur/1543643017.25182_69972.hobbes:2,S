More to the point, a quick scan of LKML will show that there are fixes for
ext3 and reisser on a regular basis, so one must assume that they don't
always work as they should either. XFS is in a number of distributions,
and is stable for users.

Does that mean he should only dislike it a little because it's small? At
this stage I would hope he will at least tell you why it wasn't accepted,
since XFS is a desirable feature for many people (as evidence vendors
providing it).
I'd like XFS, I think it's a good feature politically, hopefully it will
not just drop just as it's becoming stable for non-critical production
use.
