Well, maybe not exactly garbage but just no useful IDs.

Writing EEPROM is not a problem and can be done safely from user space
(mmap /dev/mem). Doing it in the kernel seems like an overkill,
especially if you do the operation once in few years it's much easier
to just download a (statically linked?) binary than messing with
the kernel.
It doesn't even interfere with the "main" driver and can be done while
the device is operating (given that previous EEPROM made sense,
otherwise the driver would not load).

That isn't possible in this case.
The EEPROM has to be written somehow anyway.

Right. I.e., "enable" interface with, possibly, locking mechanism,
instead of some per-class "driver".
