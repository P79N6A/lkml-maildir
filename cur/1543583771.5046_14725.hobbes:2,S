Hi,
	As far as I understand, in 2.2.x networking code the protocol
header and data used to reside in a contiguous region in memory(pointed
to by the head, data, tail, end of sk_buff struct), 
ie skb->data is the starting point and skb->tail is the ending point. 
		        |		|
		        |		|
	skb->data --	|--------------	|
		     	|		|
			|		|
			|		|
			|		|
			|		|
	skb->tail --    |---------------|
			|		|
	And the device drivers used to transfer from skb->data to
skb->tail(==skb->len).
	My question is: Is the state of the art same in 2.4.0, ie. is
protocol header and data still has to reside contiguously? Or header and
data may be non-contiguous and the driver does scatter/gather.
	I am starting off in 2.4.0 , plz. help.
