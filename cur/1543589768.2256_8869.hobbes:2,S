Subject: [PATCH] Bug in kernel/fork.c in 2.4.4 kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In working on thread core dumps I've stumbled across a minor bug in the
generic `fork' code.  The problem code is in routine `copy_mm' in
`kernel/fork.c':
	/* Copy the current MM stuff.. */
        memcpy(mm, oldmm, sizeof(*mm));
	  .
	  .
	  .
        if (retval)
                goto free_pt;
        /*
         * child gets a private LDT (if there was an LDT in the parent)
         */
        copy_segments(tsk, mm);
	  .
	  .
	  .
free_pt:
	mmput(mm);
The new `mm' doesn't get it's own private version of it's `context'
field until after the call to `copy_segments'.  At the `goto' the pointer
`mm' points to a copy of the old `mm_struct', including a copy of the
`context' field.  `mmput' will call `release_segments' which will free
the memory pointed to by the `context' field.  Later, when `oldmm' is
freed, the kernel will try to free the same memory twice - very bad.
Admittedly, this will only occur on an obscure error condition but
it should be fixed.  The attached patch fixes the problem by zeroing
out the `context' field immediately after the `mm' structure is
copied.
