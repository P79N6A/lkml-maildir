I do have 3 root busses, that's not a problem. But their resources
are all childs of the global iomem_resources which sorta represents
the system memory bus. (I do eventually declare additional resources
as child of this one, not behind any pci host bridge, like some
memory controller registers).

Well... at one point, I had more than that :( I added some code to
coalesce the ranges provided by the firmware and figured out it
mostly turned into 1 big range of 256 or 512Mb, one small in the
0xfx000000 region, and one IO. So that should fit. But nothing prevents
the firmware from setting things up differently.
But yes, at least on pmac, I think we now don't have more than 3 in
real life, though I can't speak for IBM high end stations.
We have a routine that takes whatever ranges are provided by openfirmware
and then populates the host bridge resources. This routine can fill up
to 4 slots and doesn't force any ordering on the way those are filled.
This may have to be changed, though currently, I think the case of
pci_read_bridge_bases() with a transparent bridge was the only common
routine we used that relied on this parent resource ordering assumption,
and this will be going away with your proposed patch.

They should probably then, but I haven't quite looked at the cardbus
code yet. I still think the resource management should be generic
enough not to rely on ordering & number of resources, as the actual
informations we want out of the parent resources are already encoded
in the flags (that is knowing if we deal with the parent IO window,
MEM window, or MEM+prefetch window). We have generic routines
working only on flags for finding parents when populating the
tree already.
But that isn't an urgent issue nor difficult to work around if
needed, so let's put that on hold until I can prove we really need
all of those ;)

Yah, that would make it.
Thanks for your enlightenment
Ben.
