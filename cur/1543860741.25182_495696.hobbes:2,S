True, but at the very least you have to prevent multiple cpus
from enterring OFW.  In fact this is very important.
OFW is not multi-threaded therefore you can't let multiple CPUs call
into OFW at one time.  You must use some kind of locking mechanism,
and that locking mechanism is not simple because it has to not just
stop the other cpus, it has to be able to stop the other cpus yet
still allow them to receive SMP cross-calls from the firmware if the
OFW call is 'stop' or similar.

The largest amount of memory I've ever seen consumed on sparc64
was 76K and this is 1) 64-bit and 2) an ENORMOUS machine with
lots of cpus and devices.  And I know because sparc64 prints
a kernel message at boot which states how much memory was
consumed by the in-kernel device tree copy.
That ENORMOUS machine also had a lot of ram.
76K, that's just over 8 FREAKIN PAGES.  It's nothing!
I think all this worry is overblown, terribly so in fact.
Please let's get over this memory consumption non-issue and move
on to more productive talk.
