They haven't *been* in any DJ tree.

Why the fuck should I go around finding and testing peoples trees when I
haven't submitted the stuff to them?  *YOU* shouldn't go around randomly
pulling stuff from maintainers trees without first asking them why the
change hasn't been submitted.
I'm not talking about general maintainence of the cyber2000fb driver here,
or general "keep it working" type changes.  I'm talking about a blatent
"take the version from the rmk patch and submit it to Linus without telling
the maintainer of the code you're buggering with" attitude here.
