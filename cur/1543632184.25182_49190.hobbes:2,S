hi list,
can someone explain the notes in tqueue.h?
it states:
 * - Bottom halfs are called in the reverse order that they were linked into
 *   the list.
but in queue_task it does a list_add_tail, which doesn't really explain the
above. also __run_task_queue does essentially a list_for_each, and no
list_for_each_prev.
so i cannot see any reasons why the tasks in the list shouldn't work like a
fifo.
can someone give me a hint what's wrong with my thinking? :)
thanks,
	tm
