Subject: 2.2.12 Kernel Oops in parport_pc with plip and alsa

I've been grappling with a 2.2.12 kernel oops that looks like this:
>>EIP: 25242322 Before first symbol
Trace: d00540ff <parport_pc_release_resources+13/40>
Trace: c011178f <update_process_times+5b/64>
Trace: c0110892 <wake_up_process+3a/44>
Trace: c010abfd <handle_IRQ_event+35/60>
Trace: c010a94e <do_8259A_IRQ+6e/90>
Trace: c010ad10 <do_IRQ+24/40>
Trace: c010a988 <common_interrupt+18/20>
Trace: c0108549 <cpu_idle+59/68>
The only device using the parallel port is plip. Plip works great normally
though (well it's slow but seems to be working properly) the oops only happens
when I play sounds in Alsa. But there doesn't appear to be an IRQ conflict or
I/O port conflict according to /proc/*.
I was wondering about this excerpt from 2.2.13, it doesn't seem to be
described in Alan Cox's pre13 announcements, nor can I find any mention of a
bug this would fix anywhere in the mail archives. Is it relevant to my problem
perhaps? Does anyone have a reference to where this patch came from and what
purpose it serves?
