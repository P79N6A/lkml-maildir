I think we've covered this one before.
This symbol only exists as an undefined reference at the moment, and
therefore can never be 'y'.  As such, there is little point in providing
help for it.
Even the master ARM tree doesn't contain its definition yet, so please,
stop bringing it up.
The reason you have it is that stuff has come via a different route which
relies on it - via the MTD CVS tree.
The symbol is therefore currently irrelevent, and can be placed on your
"ignore" list.
