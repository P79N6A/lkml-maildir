It wouldn't be a big problem to keep it that way on the well designed
hardware. The badly designed stuff (here Im thinking the NCR5380 I debugged
today since its fresh in my mind) I'd probably want 2 locks, one for queue
locking, one for request management.

I think you miss the point. If I have to program the system as 64
independant stacks from the app level I'm going to go slowly mad
