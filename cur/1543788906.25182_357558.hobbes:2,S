My current theory is that there is something wrong with the firmware
or hardware in your drive, and different I/O patterns have different
probabilities of triggering this problem.
Maybe you could use Jens' IO tracing patch to identify the sequence of
commands that make the drive fail. See subject "[PATCH] Block device
io tracing" posted by Jens earlier today.
If the problem is always caused by some well defined sequence of
commands, it might be possible to implement a workaround in the
pktcdvd driver.

It seems like my ISPs mail server doesn't want to talk to your mail
server. I have no idea why. I did get mails from you earlier.
