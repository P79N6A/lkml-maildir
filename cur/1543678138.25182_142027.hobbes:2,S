Yes, I use DEVFS and this was my first thought too. But even if I
unmount /dev before pivoting it's busy. (btw. it worked that way up to
2.4.20)

After booting up completely I have the devfs at /dev where it should be
and the old root at /mnt. But it's still not umount-able. No other
mounts below it and no open files.
>We use initrd + devfs for ages now (we even use romfs for initrd like
you do), and it works fine with 2.4.21 too.
I just tried with 2.4.21-ac1 and it words perfectly. But I also want
grsecurity- and crypto-patch - so I can't use ac1... :-(
