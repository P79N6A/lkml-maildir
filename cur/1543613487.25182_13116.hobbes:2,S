Hiya.
We've been having problems on a couple of machines here (with somewhat
different hardware configurations, although they've both got IDE CD writers and
multiple IDE hard disks) with cdrecord failing on later 2.4-series kernels.
Both are running 2.4.16, although we've seen the same problems on other recent
kernels.
The error typically looks like this, although we've had variations on it in the
past:
cdrecord: Input/output error. write_g1: scsi sendcmd: no error
CDB:  2A 00 00 02 77 24 00 00 1F 00
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 03 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 0C 09 00 00
Sense Key: 0x3 Medium Error, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0x0C Qual 0x09 (write error - loss of streaming) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid) 
cmd finished after 5.551s timeout 40s
On one machine, I was able to fix this by altering the plug-and-play IRQ
allocation rules in the BIOS settings; it now appears to work reliably, whereas
previously CD writing failed approximately half the time. IRQ 5 was originally
shared with bttv, btaudio and eth0 when writes were failing; it's now only used
by the IDE controller (and bttv, btaudio and eth0 are using IRQ 9).

On the other, cdrecord worked reliably on 2.4.7; an upgrade to 2.4.10 caused CD
writing to fail as described above; upgrading to 2.4.16 appeared to cure it
again until we added a new hard disk, hdd. (I suspect there might have been two
different problems here...)

We shuffled hard disks around again (removing hdh and putting hdd in its
place), and it appears to work with this config:

Further information available on request; while we've fixed the problem for
now, it would certainly be nice to know why it's doing it...
Thanks very much,
