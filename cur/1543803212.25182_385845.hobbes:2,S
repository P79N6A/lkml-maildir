Variables whose size varies according to Kconfig are surprisingly expensive
with respect to maintenence cost and runtime stability risk.  The main
offended is sector_t.
I am forever fixing people's code which does
	printk("%ld", some_sector_t);
With CONFIG_LBD=n that's fine.  With CONFIG_LBD=y it generates a warning.
The consequences of that warning are:
a) It'll probably print a garbage number
b) If the printk did
	printk("%d %s", some_sector_t, some_string);
   then printk might well oops the kernel, because `some_string' will be
   passed in either the wrong register or in the wrong stack slot.
   And because printks are almost always in rare error paths, such an
   oops will probably sail through everyone's kernel testing and will only
   hit users when rare things like I/O errors or disk corruption occur.
The best fix for the printk(sector_t) problem is
	printk("%llu", (unsigned long long)some_sector_t);
All other solutions have subtle problems.
So now we're proposing to repeat the sector_t problem with a bunch of new
fields.  Fortunately we're less likely to be putting these particular
fields into printk statements but I note that CIFS (at least) has a couple
such statements and with your patch they're now generating warnings (and
potential runtime bugs).
On the other hand, for a fairly fat .config which has 17 filesystems in
.vmlinux:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4633032 1011304  248288 5892624  59ea10 vmlinux		CONFIG_LSF=y
4633680 1011304  248288 5893272  59ec98 vmlinux		CONFIG_LSF=n
It's probably less 0.5 kbytes for usual embedded .config.
I just don't think the benefit of CONFIG_LSF outweighs its costs.
