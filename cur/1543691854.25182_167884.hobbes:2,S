Even x86 pays at least a one cycle penalty for every misaligned access.
In general, open source code has no excuse for using misaligned fields.
It's (mostly) avoidable.  TCP/IP headers are the historical exception.
One could make the same arguement that a modern NIC should not require
16 byte alignment for DMA. It's a tradeoff one way or the other.
Just a matter of perspective.
