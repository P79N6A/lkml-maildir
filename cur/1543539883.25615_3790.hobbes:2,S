A properly designed protocol would have had support for this sort of
extension to existing facilities, without inventing whole new dialects.
In this case, probably the lock & unlock commands for removable media -
just add a "password" field - **and include this in the standard so no
other vendor uses the same field for something else, or vice versa**.
If I wanted to add a new listing mode to `ls' for some reason, should I
add a new switch to ls's vocabulary, or invent `newls'?
Alternatively, if I really needed a new command for my new feature - drill
holes in disk, say - I get it included in the next revision of the
standard. That way, all you ever need is the latest ATA-* driver.
In short, don't embrace and extend the standard with proprietary things.
If you need a new feature in the standard, put it in the fscking standard
- don't write your own!
James.
