I have tried several things to try and make my computer shut down properly
when halting the system. I'm trying to apply a patch, but it doesn't seem
to be working. This is the error I get:
<p><tt>tching file `linux/arch/i386/kernel/apm.c'</tt>

<p>Can someone tell me how I can apply this patch successfully?</html>
