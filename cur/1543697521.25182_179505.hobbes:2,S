Hello all,
I just found out that either I did not understand what the "keepsettings" flag
in hdparm is meant to be, or it does not work as expected. Situation is as
follows:
Trying to record DVDs with a SONY DRU-500A connected to
00:0f.1 IDE interface: ServerWorks CSB5 IDE Controller (rev 93)
I do "hdparm -k1 -d1 /dev/hdc" and see:
/dev/hdc:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 setting keep_settings to 1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
Then I try recording, but something bad happens:
Nov 23 16:36:50 box kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid
5977459, scsi3, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 UNKNOWN(0x54) 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Nov 23 16:36:50 box kernel: hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Nov 23 16:36:50 box kernel: hdc: ATAPI reset complete
And after that:
# hdparm /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 BLKRAGET failed: Invalid argument
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
DMA is off. Is this expected? Recording btw _continues_, only without DMA. This
happens during high load situations...
Regards,
Stephan
