As far as I know none of the significant contributors on either fbdev
or DRM are being paid to work on the project.

I'd like to take this further and move the stuff in drivers/video to
drivers/video/fb and then
move drm from drivers/char/drm to drivers/video/drm. I'd also like to
consolidate drm and fbdev Kconfig menus.

If you removed the EXPORT_SYMBOLs and compiled everything in, won't
the compiler just eliminate the dead code for you?
PCI Express is a big reason for the new core/personality split. There
are Nforce4 motherboards now with 16 16x sockets. That means you can
plug 16 different video cards in if you want. The days of a single AGP
slot are over. If someone will send me one (with the four Opteron
chips) I'll write drivers for it.

This not binding to the PCI device has to be fixed. DRM can not
support hotplug or suspend/resume without a device to bind to.

I have already coded most of this up and it works for me.
Unfortunately I derived it from the DRM codebase instead of the fbdev
one. fbdev has changed too much in the last six months to allow a
simple merge. Now I'm regenerating patches against fbdev using my
prior code.
A smaller step is to just treat radeonfb as the base module. This will
eat up extra memory for x86 users and they will complain, but we can
split it into three pieces later.
I think good first step would simply be to get DRM and fbdev both into
drivers/video and get the DRM h files into include/linux.

My head hurts thinking about how much editing this would involve.
