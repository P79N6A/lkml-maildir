Check the code, there's a conditional former in the file and S3 will
correctly fail. I don't feel like flipping bits from here
(arch-dep-code) in generic code.

Good idea. So acpi_system_save_state can no longer be called with S5,
right? That allows quite a lot of cleanup.
Hmm, how do you propose error handling when SUSPEND_DISABLE fails?
Call SUSPEND_ENABLE or not? Once that is decided  panic can go. But I
still think that just should not happen.
