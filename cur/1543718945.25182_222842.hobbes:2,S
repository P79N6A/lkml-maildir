I did some testing a year or two back with the normal zone wound down to a
few hundred megs - filesytem benchmarks were *severely* impacted by the
increased turnover rate of fs metadata pagecache and VFS caches.  I forget
the details, but it was "wow".

I'm suspecting we'll end up needing mempools (or something) of 1- and
2-order pages to support large-frame networking.  I'm surprised there isn't
more pressure to do something about this.  Maybe people are increasing
min_free_kbytes.
