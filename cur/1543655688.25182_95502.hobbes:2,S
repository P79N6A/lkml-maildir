Subject: [PATCH] mmap.c - do_mmap_pgoff() small correction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

    Hi Linus :)
    This is a correction for a patch I sent you that you included in
the 2.5.x tree. The patch I sent you fixed a corner case for the
mmap() syscall, where the requested size was too big (namely, bigger
than SIZE_MAX-PAGE_SIZE). Unfortunately, the patch did a wrong
assumption that is not true in some archs where TASK_SIZE is the full
address space available, as sparc64. So, the patch didn't fix
anything on those archs :((
    David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com> pointed this and made this new
patch that fixes the spot. Now it should work in all archs.
    If you have any doubt, just tell.
    Raúl
