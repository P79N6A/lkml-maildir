Worse yet, assuming you work for a sufficiently large company,
your license is void if or as soon as anybody works in that
company's name on something BKS (or any legal successor of
them *) considers as competition.
(* I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not sure if GPLing BK in the last
   moment before, say, bankruptcy, would really work.)
