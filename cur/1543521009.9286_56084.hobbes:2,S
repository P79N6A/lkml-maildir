I don't want to start any C-war.
I use C from 1982 and it's my favourite programming language.
As You can see I've used a question mark to hilight the question nature of my
statement.
What I meant was :
Why split a sigle, atomic, register clobber free and less expensive instruction
like "incl xx" with a - load , incr , store sequence.
The only reason I can see is the absence of the "incl" instruction on some
processor.
Cheers,
