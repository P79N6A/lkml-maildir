Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.19pre hfmodem/refclock.c asm statement error
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

drivers/char/hfmodem/refclock.c fails to compile with "gcc version 2.95.2
20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)", but compiles normally with "gcc version
2.7.2.3". GNU assembler 2.9.5 was used in both cases. Here is the error
message:
refclock.c: In function `hfmodem_refclock_current':
refclock.c:136: Invalid `asm' statement:
refclock.c:136: fixed or forbidden register 0 (ax) was spilled for class AREG.
Here is the offending line:
__asm__("mull %2" : "=d" (tmp2), "=a" (tmp4) : "m" (scale_rdtsc), "1" (tmp0) : "ax");
It appears that above code declares register eax as output and globbered
register simultaneously. My gcc docs say: "You may not write a clobber
description in a way that overlaps with an input or output operand." Below
is a patch against 2.2.19pre16 to fix this. Please consider applying.
