This should be:
     offset = (unsigned long long) p->index << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
BTW, you can use FUSE + LUFIS for running LUFS filesystems with the
FUSE kernel module. Or even better: you can write your filesystem
natively with FUSE ;)
You can download LUFIS from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf,
 FUSE
is already in debian testing.
Cheers,
Miklos
