On attempting to boot this kernel, I get the following just before init:
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:05
2.5.67 base works fine. I discovered that reverting the following 
patches allows me to boot. I can increase the granularity of my search 
if nothing comes immediately to mind:
aggregated-disk-stats.patch
dynamic-hd_struct-allocation-fixes.patch
dynamic-hd_struct-allocation.patch
I reverted the aggregated-xx patch because it depends on the dynamic 
hd_struct work in a single line;
+               struct hd_struct *hd = gp->part[n];
Therefore it may not be this patch that is the source of the problem, 
but I backed it out anyway.
Cheers,
Alistair Strachan.
