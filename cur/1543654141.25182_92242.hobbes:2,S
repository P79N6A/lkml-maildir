Yes, but I hadn't paid much attention to modules before, so I only
understood about half of what you said, sorry. It was interesting
to learn that there were actually so many problems, though :-)

Hmm, if "expose interface" == "publish symbol", why can't you simply

interface" == "register something somewhere", then this has to be
undone anyway. Or am I overlooking something here ?
