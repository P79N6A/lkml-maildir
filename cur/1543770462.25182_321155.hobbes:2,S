Forget host based queueing, it's worthless. The device needs knowledge
of the pending commands to eliminate rotational delay, which is
basically the real win of command queueing.

SATA is still pretty fast without NCQ, it just makes some operations a
lot faster. But of course if you want the best, you would opt for some
setup that allows NCQ. To my knowledge, ahci compliance doesn't
guarantee NCQ support (the adapter flags it in its host capability
flags), so I don't know if the newer VIA will get you NCQ support.
People have lived happily without NCQ support in SATA for years, I'm
sure you could too :-)
