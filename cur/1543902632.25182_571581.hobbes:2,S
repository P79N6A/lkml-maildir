I've just tested it with 2.6.22
(e1c1e98d2a3f57b22a0d4136c8160e54404aa437 commit) and did not found any
problems - after qute big files were transferred there is no observed 
previously skb leak, no crashes (quite a few debug options are turned on 
in config) and files are correct on both peers, so it works good.
