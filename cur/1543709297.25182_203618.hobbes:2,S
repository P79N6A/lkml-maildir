Recoverability matters to me. The driver could be 10 megabyte and
*I* would not care. XFS seems to stand no matter how rudely the OS
is knocked down.
After a few hundred crashes (laptop, kids, drained batteries) I'd expect 
something bad to happen, but no. XFS returns my data quickly and happily
everytime (as opposed to most of the time). Maybe the're a bit of luck.
Salute to XFS!
