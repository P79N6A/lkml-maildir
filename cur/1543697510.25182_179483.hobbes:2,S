Hi Vladimir,
I must've messed something up when testing the updates of ctime during a
rename on ext2, because when looking at the ext2 code the ctime of a
renamed file doesn't normally get updated.  Maybe I simply forgot to
test it on ext2 and only tested out tmpfs.  Oops. :)  Sorry for the
confusion.  Based on my findings below, ext2's (or minix or ufs for that
matter) behavior seems also inconsistent with some of the other FSes I
mentioned below (ext2/minix/ufs also seem to share a lot of code in
their rename functions).
When glancing through the 2.6.0-test9 source code, I verified that ext3
updates the ctime (fs/ext3/namei.c:2244, with the comment, "Like most
other Unix systems, set the ctime for inodes on a rename."), JFS updates
ctime (fs/jfs/namei.c:1231), xfs updates it (xfs/xfs_rename.c:480), etc.
I believe all these updates are made for both directories and
non-directories, so it appears that your patch which updates only a
directory's ctime needs to cover non-directories as well (at least if
you're trying to be consistent across other Linux filesystems like
ext3/jfs/xfs).
