OK, thanks for that. It would be quite helpful if you edit
kernel/sched.c and turn the line #undef SCHED_DOMAIN_DEBUG into
#define SCHED_DOMAIN_DEBUG, then compile a kernel with debugging
info enabled.
Boot again, and capture another screenshot of the oops. This will
hopefully include the SCHED_DOMAIN_DEBUG output.
Also run
	addr2line -e /path/to/vmlinux EIP
vmlinux is the file generated in the root directory of the source
tree after compilation. EIP is the EIP value printed by the Oops.
Thanks.
