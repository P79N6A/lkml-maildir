[2/9] netconsole: Remove bogus check
The (!np.dev) check in write_msg() is bogus (always false), because:
np.dev is set by netpoll_setup(), which is called by the target init
code in init_netconsole() _before_ register_console() => write_msg() cannot
be triggered unless netpoll_setup() returns with success. And that will not
happen if netpoll_setup() failed to set np.dev. Also np.dev cannot go from
under us while netconsole is loaded. This is because netpoll_setup() grabs
a reference for us on that dev. So let's remove the pointless check.
