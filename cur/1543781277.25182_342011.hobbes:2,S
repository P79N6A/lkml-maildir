Hello list,
I have multiple network cards (eth0-4) with all the same IP address 
(192.168.20.1) and mask (/16) assigned. I have observed upon pinging a 
yet-unknown address, e.g. .20.4, that the ARP-who-has queries are only sent 
out on eth0. I am pretty sure this is standard Linux behavior, so does anyone 
know how I can tune the kernel or its subsystems to send the ARP on all 
interfaces that match the route?
