That's what AF_UNIX does.
But with other protocols, we can't jiggle the loopback
MTU just because higher allocs no longer are easily
obtainable.
Really, the networking should not try to grab anything
more than SKB_MAX_ORDER unless the device's MTU is
larger than PAGE_SIZE << SKB_MAX_ORDER, which loopback's
"16K - fudge" is not.
