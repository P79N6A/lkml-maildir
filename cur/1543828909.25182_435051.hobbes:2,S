To be honest I am still very confused about this one as well. It isn't
just occurring with the CDR-6S48 either, a few other reports look as if
they are the same kind of problem.
I didn't spot anything in the ATAPI spec but I need to go back over it
in case I missed something here. Similarly I can find nothing in the VIA
docs to explain the occurence.
I don't see anything fundamentally wrong with the patch, I'd just like
to understand better the real reasons behind it.
