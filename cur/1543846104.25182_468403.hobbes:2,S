so after getting several disagreements on this, you are going ahead
with it.  I'm disappointed, but I agree that you have a right to
do so.  (IOW, I wouldn't be disappointed if some other patches
were merged even though someone disapproved of them :)
And the memory savings are not a big deal.  You even mentioned that
you had it confused with /proc/kallsyms.
