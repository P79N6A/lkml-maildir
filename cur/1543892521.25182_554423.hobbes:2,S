Yup, I agree that we will always need to work around BIOS bugs.
But smsc-ircc2 contains a *lot* of preconfigure stuff.  I'm
skeptical that all of it is really to work around BIOS bugs.
I think it's more likely that Linux just isn't using the PNP
info correctly or drivers for other southbridge devices are
getting in the way.
