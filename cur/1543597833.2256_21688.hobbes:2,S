Alan's kernel has some additions which are not in Linus'
tree, Linus has a few things not in Alan's tree.
I'm currently trying to merge some of the more obviously
right things from -linus to -ac.
In my opinion, use-once is something of which all the
consequences are not quite clear yet, so I don't think
I'll be porting that over.
I will be looking at changes to reduce the impact of
streaming IO further, but don't expect anything to be
merged before its impact is well understood and tested.
regards,
Rik
