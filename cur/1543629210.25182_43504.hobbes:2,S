You don't need any additional common code abstraction to make virtual
address 3G+256G to point to physical address 1G as in my example above,
after that you're free to put the physical ram between 1G and 1G+256M
into the zone normal of node 1 and the stuff should keep working but
with zone-normal spread in more than one node.  You just have full
control on virt_to_page, pci_map_single, __va.  Actually it may be as
well cleaner to just let the arch define page_address() when
discontigmem is enabled (instead of hacking on top of __va), that's a
few liner. (the only true limit you have is on the phys ram above 4G,
that cannot definitely go into zone-normal regardless if it belongs to a
direct mapping or not because of pci32 API)
