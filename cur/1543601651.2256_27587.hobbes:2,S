did it happen as frequently/easily as before or did you need to stress
it much harder? And I'm also curious what happens if we simply lower the
watemark (possibly it was too high). Anyways the other patch is a good
idea to apply anyways.
So can now try the below new one?

the fact is, kswapd is the only entity meant to shrink the caches for
the atomic pages, it exactly knows what are the zones that needs to be
balanced and we have a min-min/2 of pages of GAP that must be refilled
in time. It just seems kswapd doesn't cope with the frequency of the
allocations sometime, this may be ok but maybe we must find a way to
more aggressively free memory for the atomic allocations or it could
simply mean that the watermark GAP was too small as Marcelo just
suggested previously.
Can you also resolve "c012e052" so we know who's allocating those pages
just in case?
