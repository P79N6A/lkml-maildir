Used to be that the code did this:
	if (u.u_euid == 0)
		return(SUCCESS)
	if (do the real checks)
	...
which is the simplest logic. It's optimized for root,
not the regular user and makes doing things like audit more
difficult. With this code the mode bits could contain the first
chapter of Revelations and the kernel would never even bother
to look.
We live now, of course, in a more enlightened age.
