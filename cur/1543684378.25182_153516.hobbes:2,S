The lock contention is unrelated apart from the mangling of pgd_ctor().
The node locality is only important on systems with exaggerated NUMA
characteristics, such as the kind Martin and I bench on.

I don't believe it would be valuable to push it on the grounds of
performance, as the performance characteristics of modern midrange i386
systems don't have such high remote access penalties.
The complaint was targetted more at errors in some new incoming patch
