Adding a tid field is relatively easy.  Fixing the race condition
between setting it in the new thread and using it in the creating
thread is harder, but not impossible.  But, even setting it in the new
thread would create an incompatible interface.  With hundreds of JACK
client applications, binary compatibility is a serious consideration.
Due to the absurd difficulty of successfully creating a realtime
thread under the various incompatible Linux kernels and pthread
libraries, we export jack_create_thread() to applications.  That way,
they can take advantage of our latest fix for the latest NPTL botch
(0.60 was particularly bad).
So, the new thread's start_routine is not necessarily ours.  I suppose
we could provide an internal function to intialize the thread and then
call the requester's start_routine.  But, this is getting to be a
significant time sink.
Eventually, I can probably cobble something together that will
establish whether your current 2.6.10 SCHED_OTHER works with nice -20.
Is that all we're trying to accomplish?  I do think it can be made to
work (on some kernel versions, given appropriate privileges, with
kernel thread priorities adjusted properly, etc.).
But, that does not meet any of my needs.
