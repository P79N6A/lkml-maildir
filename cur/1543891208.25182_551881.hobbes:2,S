Indeed. Acked-by: implies authority, and only very few people should be 
able to do it. Namely, the only person who can ACK a patch is a person who 
could also NACK a patch and expect it to actually be dropped. If I think a 
patch is bad, I can say so, but as I have no authority, my statement would 
be taken on merit alone, whereas Linus or Andrew or such could just NACK 
it and move on without having to spew a blurb every time.
