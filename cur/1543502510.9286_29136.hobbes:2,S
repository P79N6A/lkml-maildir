Use inline asm. In Intel, you put the high long-word into edx, the low
long-word into eax, and "div" either by an immediate or something in, say
the ecx register. The result is a long-word in eax, with the remainder
in edx.
This results in an unsigned integer divide, which is what the __udivxxx
means.
