I plan to write a small kernel compile HOWTO. There I will cover
both usage scenarios.
It is supposed to obsolete commands.txt as of today.
makefiles.txt will cover only how to write Makefiles and what they
can be used to do. I kept chapter two because it was a good
definition of the target group.
But I agree with you that the information you requests are missing.
Btw. my patch to build the kernel in a separate directory is
not yet ready for inclusion. oprofile and xfs causes me trouble,
they refuse to do things in the normal way.
Also the lack of consistency when including files annoy me.
I hope to get some feedback from Kai on this soon.

[Above is a left-over from the old document, will be updated].
Rules.make vanished when Kai did the spilt into scripts/Makefile.build,
scripts/Makefile.lib, scripts/Makefile.clean etc.
It started with me submitting a patch that made "make clean" descend
down in all directories. That was way too slow, and Kai made the split
speeding up "make clean" a lot.
The concept is that make is called with:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=path/to/makefile
Then Makefile.build includes $(obj)/Makefile.
Therefore the individual Makefiles no longer need to include any
file, and Rules.make became obsolete.
IIRC this concept was originally described some time ago at
kbuild-devel.

I have a pending patch introducing head-y for all architectures.
If it is rejected I will update the text.

Abbrevation came form the wrong language ;-)

I have KBUILD_VERBOSE=0 in my .bashrc, but I see your point.

Helps a lot, thanks indeed!
All corrections applied.
