I don't think you are understanding the proposal
2.6.11.y will be released as 2.6.12 is being developed.
once 2.6.12 is released (or shortly after that if 2.6.12 ends up being a 
_real_ mess) 2.6.11.y will not get any additional releases (2.6.12.y will 
get released instead)
as a result there will be no backports at all. if you want a feature 
that's introduced in 2.6.12 then you wait until you get a 2.6.12.y release 
that's good enough for you.
also I think the expectation is that there aren't going to be more then 
2-3 2.6.x.y releases so your comment of people waiting until y>5 won't 
apply
