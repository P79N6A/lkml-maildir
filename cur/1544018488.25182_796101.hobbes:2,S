Ah. CONFIG_X86_RDC321X is indeed the issue.
>From arch/x86/include/asm/timex.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_ELAN
#  define PIT_TICK_RATE 1189200 /* AMD Elan has different frequency! */
#elif defined(CONFIG_X86_RDC321X)
#  define PIT_TICK_RATE 1041667 /* Underlying HZ for R8610 */
#else
#  define PIT_TICK_RATE 1193182 /* Underlying HZ */
#endif
This gives the kernel an incorrect slower frequency for the PIT hardware
on your system and is why the TSC calibration is off and why the ACPI PM
gets thrown out.
I'd think this would ideally be more of a subarch in the config
selection like the AMD Elan is, so folks know it really is not just a
extra-support feature and in fact limits what hardware you can use the
resulting kernel on.
Florian, any thoughts on this? Would a patch like the following
(untested) be ok by you?
thanks
