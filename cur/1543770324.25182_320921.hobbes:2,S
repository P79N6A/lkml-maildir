At first, no. It's a complicated problem and kernel preemptibility is
only a part of it. It's a critical part of it since it's got to
eventually feed to a scheduler of some sort. Feeding large temporal
chunks, high latency, to a scheduler defeats how priority in the system
is expressed in relation to other threads in the system.

Yeah, but really this is can only seriously be taken if you have numbers
showing that there's more contention on these paths. Until that happens
the actual scenario is unknown. But I strongly suspect that it doesn't
really make a difference mainly because of all of the SMP work that's
been done to Linux over the years. It's fundamentally about a contention
problem.

Adaptiving spinning is a difficult thing to do since you have to snoop
for the active "current" on other processors to determine if you have to
sleep or not. FreeBSD 5.x uses this stuff and the locking code is very
complicated. In the future, it maybe desirable to incorporate parts of
this functionality into another RT mutex implementation. The current one
is overloaded enough with functionality as is .

That's reversed. Interrupt threads are an isolated change itself and can
be submitted upstream if so desired with no associated lock changes.
But that paragraph above is rather vague, so I can only guess at what you're
talking about. There are ways of doing context stealing with irq-threads to
minimize overhead and the FreeBSD folks have partially implemented this from
my memory.
