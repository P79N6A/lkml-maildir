Every now and then there is some attempt to find One solution to bind
them all: x86, SoC, ACPI ... you name it.
Unfortunately, while it's true that there are significant similarities,
there are also notable differencies; as far as i know the USB subsystem
is the one that gets closer to what we have in the embedded arena, since
it can have complex cases of parent-child powering and wakeup.

What you are saying can be summarised as making the driver model more
expressive.

That is not part of the fw: the fw simply expresses parent-child clock
distribution and keeps usecounts so that unused clocks are automatically
gated.
The actual clock tree description is platform/arch/board specific and
doesn't affect the framework. You can just roll your own version for x86
by providing a description of the methods used to switch on/off every
individual clock on your board.
So what you are asking for is that somebody writes an x86 version of the
clock fw.
As for latencies, well, only few clocks really have significant impact.
Most notably the main system oscillator. Everything else has 0 latency
since it ends up in opening/closing a clock gate.
Powering device on/off will certainly introduce more latency, but either
the powering is supported by the hw, to make it quick or it has to go
through most, if not all of he usual initialisation sequence; in that
case it probably makes sense to avoid controlling it from kernelspace,
since it will be slow and won't require dedcisions made with us
precision.

I want to avoid redesigning the wheel: the current version is not round
yet, but re-starting from a triangle every time is far less appealing.

Unless some new hw/technology shows up, I'm afraid the available set of
ideas is very limited :-)

I don't think you have got it right: the only info being passed is the
standard cpufreq list of frequencies; everything else is part of the
cpufreq driver.

It's just a  notification. The drivers are supposed to know how to deal
with it.
In OMAP2 the major concern is that the external memory cannot be
accessed since it is on a bus that is being re-clocked:
- the dma controllers must be paused
- the other cores (dsp) must not access sdram
- the onenand driver needs to adjust its timing parameters

It always looks great at this level of abstraction, but then usually
what is discovered later is that _a lot_ of extra complexity is
introduced, in order to cover every case on every platform that is
intended to be supported.

if you check cpufreq, you will find out that it already covers the
multiple cores case (but nothing prevents from using the same logic on
something that is not really a cpu) and also has some simple concept of
latency for frequency transition, concept that could be enhanced to
handle latencies that are depending on the current operating point and
target operating point.

cpufreq could be renamed to anything that makes sense, but i see _no_
massive broadening of functionality.

No, that doesn't make sense, as general approach.
You want to manage from kernel only those parts of the system where the
latency is so low that userspace wouldn't be able to keep up.
Your examples (wireless, disk drive) can be easily controlled from
userspace, with a timeout.
In both cases there are significant delays (change of rotation speed /
sync with the access point).
All this is hand waiving unless it is backed up by numbers.
Real cases are required in order to establish a list of priorities for
latency/power consumption.
Afterward, a valid solution that can address such cases can be sketched.
