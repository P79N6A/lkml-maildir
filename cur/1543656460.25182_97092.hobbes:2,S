I have started working on a similar patch for 2.5. Other thing in my todo list is to
split this patch up into chunks.
Other comments inlined below.

I am not really sure about the local APIC versions in summit. What I remember seeing on
lkml was summit has older IOAPIC version. Can someone clarify this?

oops.. I somehow missed these 'if' coding style stuff. changing it immediately.

I will also eliminate CONFIG_X86_APIC_CLUSTER and use CONFIG_X86_CLUSTERED_APIC directly.

Yes, right now CONFIGURED_PLATFORM_NUMA implies clustered_apic_mode, and one of the 
checks in the above 'if' is redundant. Will do a search and replace of NUMA by NUMAQ.
