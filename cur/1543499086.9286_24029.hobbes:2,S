Yes. This is one of the most annoying things in this debate, and seems
very hypocritical. If people want to use the purist argument against
devfs, then they should be consistent. Get rid of procfs (at least,
all the non-process stuff), autofs and knfsd.
Look to devfs as a way of cleaning up procfs instead. Move all the
non-process stuff into devfs. That way we can get back to a procfs the
way it was intended.
