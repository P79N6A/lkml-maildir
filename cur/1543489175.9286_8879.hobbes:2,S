Erm, yes, I did know that.

Yes it is, assuming the CPU can be switched from BE to LE mode. Which
it can. As Linus said, we could use BE and swap bytes for the x86
compatibility mode. But that's ugly.

Those issues are already dealt with, since the BE ports (Sparc, MIPS)
have to talk to PCI devices which are generally LE. Some devices
(framebuffers) map their memory twice: once for LE and again for
BE. But you can't rely on that.
Anyway, the point is that you can switch the CPU behaviour in
software, and you then have to deal with the implications of that. For
example, if you had the kernel LE but allowed user space to switch to
BE, you would have to swap bytes when transferring between kernel and
user spaces. Ugly in the extreme.
