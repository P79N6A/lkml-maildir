I don't disagree that it should be settable.  However, retries occur for
other reasons than failures inside the device.  The most standard ones
are unit attentions generated because of other activity (target reset
etc).  The key to the problem is retrying only operations that are
genuinely retryable, which the mid-layer doesn't do such a good job on.

For the MD case, this is what REQ_FAILFAST is for.
