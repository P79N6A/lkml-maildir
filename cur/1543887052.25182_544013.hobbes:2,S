Sure they do. We've always had interdependencies and freezer-related 
problems. That's why PF_NOFREEZE exists in the first place.
Claiming this is somehow CPU hotplug-related is disingenious, since the 
freezer hasn't even been used for that historically, yet clearly we *do* 
have the NOFREEZE stuff.
Those kernel threads tend to exists for a reason.
