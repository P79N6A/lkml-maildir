Following is the scenario:
Kernel is going to prefault the huge page for user virtual address V.  
Let us say the pointer pte points to the page table entry (for x86 it is
PDE/PMD) which maps the hugepage.  
At this point *pte == 0.  CPU also has this entry cached in its TLB.
Meaning, unless this entry is purged or displaced, for virtual address V
CPU will generate the page fault (as the P bit is not set and assuming
this fault has the highest precedence).
Kernel updates the *pte so that it now maps the hugepage at virtual
address V to physical address P.  
Later when the user process make a reference to V, because of stale TLB
entry, the processor gets PAGE_FAULT.

With pte entry, I mean the entry that is mapping the hugepage (leaf
level entry).  This entry could be sitting in PDE/PMD for x86 or VHPT
for IA-64. This entry is referring to what the processor uses for
translation to get to huge page.

IA-64, for example, directly maps the last level of page table.
Processor directly uses this table to find the translations.  So, there
is no pmd here.
But it is entirely possible on x86 arch as well that any level of PDE
(PMD), PTE could be getting prefetched.  That is why architecture
requires invalidate/purge operations whenever any of this entry changes.

On x86 it surely is.  For 64-bit there is 100G or more of mmaps...
And then you will have to do this purge for all the processes that are trying
to mmap hugepages.

The prefetching problem is handled OK for regular pages because we can
handle page faults corresponding to those pages.  That is currently not
true for hugepages.  Currently the kernel assumes that PAGE_FAULT
happening against a hugetlb page is caused by truncate and returns
SIGBUS.
