I have never been a big fan of ACPI, having seen too many broken ACPI
tables.  But if that is what you want ...
Bjorn, could you apply my previous patch anyway, boot your problem
system with kdb_skip_keyboard, drop into KDB and
'md4c1 acpi_kbd_controller_present'.  That will quickly confirm if acpi
is detecting the absence of the keyboard on your system.
