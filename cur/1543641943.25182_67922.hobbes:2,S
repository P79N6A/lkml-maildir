what CPU usage does it have? 70% CPU usage is not interactive.
well, even 70% CPU usage can be interactive if you lower its priority to
-20. But with the default nice value a task will lose its interactivity
much quicker.
also, could you increase HZ to 1000 (in asm/param.h, full recompile of the
kernel is needed), does it make a difference?
