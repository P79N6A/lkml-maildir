kbuild is optimised for kernel usage.
And within the kernel only xfs and oprofile (+a few others)
have files spread over more than one directory like in your
example. This is not considered good practice and therefore
kbuild does not document this usage - neither encourage it.
Also kbuild does not support building .a file in the way you
want it to do.
You can do the following:
obj-$(CONFIG_foo) += main/main_code.o
obj-$(CONFIG_foo) += lib1/part1/file_1_1_1.c
obj-$(CONFIG_foo) += lib1/part2/file1_2_1.o
etc.

Please point out in what section you miss information and I will try to
update it.
I for one consider the kbuild syntax well documented, but I may be a bit
biased in this respect.
