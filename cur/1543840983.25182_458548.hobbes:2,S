And which can still be enabled - I think fastcall is for this, and it
is still useful.
However more useful is to move many wrappers where this is possible
to headers (for instance the ones calling just
CHOOSE_MODE($me_tt,$me_skas) - moving them to headers is always
possible and saves a call).

For my knowledge, the only user is the non-UML Linux kernel, which
doesn't use libc :-).
And if you want to mix regparm and not regparm calls, you end up
marking it at a prototype level (i.e. with the old approach); GCC
could be smarter and allow specifying it at a per-header or per
header-folder level, but I do not think it does.

Fine... it is actually a good idea for some points (we currently
refrain from using certain things, such as futexes, because our
tricks could conflict with glibc tricks which we don't know - with
klibc it would be different).
We'll see.
