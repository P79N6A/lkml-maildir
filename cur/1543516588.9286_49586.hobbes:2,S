Ted, I get the same buffer overrun on two modern systems: a brand-new
Dell I3700 laptop, and a SCSI-only P2B-S motherboard.  Furthermore, the
problem will occur when there is relatively little disk activity.  On
the other hand, the error is much more frequent when there's significant
CPU load.
What about Brian's note about the overruns not occurring when he's
running a 2.3 kernel?  Is there any significant difference between the
2.2 and 2.3 serial drivers that would account for this?

Not really an option.  We're trying to make a piece of software that can 
be used on J. Random User's PC.
