(Could you resend the IBAC patch to the disec list as well?)
Is IBAC basically a 'demo' lsm?  It only hooks bprm_security, so you
can't execute anything with a bad hash, right?  So really if you were to
also hook mmap, this would completely do away with the need for digsig?
IBAC is automatically able to use any integrity measurement modules you
write, whether they use gpg like digsig does right now, or use the tpm?
It also shows how simple it would be to hook selinux, though I guess
there are several ways we might want to hook selinux - 1. to check only
security.selinux xattrs, 2. to check integrity of entry point types, 3.
to check integrity of any files labeled by the integrity measurement
module as needing to be checked.
Is there any way for the LSM itself to direct which data and metadata
will be measured?  It looks like this is done by separately configuring
the integrity measurement module - which seems fine to me.
