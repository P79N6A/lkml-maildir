Just to notify anybody interested that I have started working on fixing
UMSDOS support for 2.6 kernels (as there still seems to be some people
wanting it). 
Patch that enables UMSDOS to compile and insmod is available at 
http://linux.voyager.hr/umsdos/
It still doesn't work (triggers kernel BUG() after few write ops), 
but I'll post another announcements when I get it in working condition.
