Well, all of that are changes in the right direction, but I'm not sure if it's
the right time to do that just now.  For example, suspend_64.c in your patch
is missing the comments on __save/restore_processor_state() already queued
up for 2.6.25 by Ingo.
Any chance to base the patch on top of the mm branch of
/pub/scm / linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git ?
Thanks,
