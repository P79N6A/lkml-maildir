as far as i know the normal acpi and apm idle calls will only save
marginaly power without the disconnect function. but if the function does
make problems your on the better way without it ... sadly there is no way
to "tweak" things right for boards wich hafe this problems , cause you
have only a switch (register in the northbridge) which you could trigger
... and if it does not worl allright with it, so only way is to not use
the function ... this is one of the reasons, way there is an flag you have
to set on the boot-prompt ... it is more easy to test and to deactivate if
it doesn't work
