Doesn't this rely on the non-standard GNUism that you can
perform pointer-arithmetic on a void-pointer? Which is illegal,
immoral, and fattening. I'd much rather see char-pointers so
it's valid to perform the offset math. That way, in the future,
a new tool that follows (ANSI, IEEE, POSIX) rules doesn't barf.
I suggest a new pointer type like (BASE *) or (BAR *) that
hides the (unsigned char *) necessary to not barf, plus
minimize side-effects.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
