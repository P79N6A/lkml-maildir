I always went by:
 VIRT = RES + SWAPPED OUT
$ ps aufwwx | grep mingetty
#user pid %cpu %mem   vsz  rsz
root 2490  0.0  0.2  1548  552 tty1     Ss+  Oct25   0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty1
$ swapoff -a ## for fun
$ ps aufwwx | grep mingetty
root 2490  0.0  0.2  1548  632 tty1     Ss+  Oct25   0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty1
So to say, VIRT = RES + SHR + SWAPPED OUT, probably.

Have <= 128 MB RAM? Have a heavy busy system (even with >= 128)?

Ph... you're missing upx -9 on supervise ;)

Remember that glibc might be shared amongst processes, so *each* process will
have the 1 mb listed, though swap might stay at 0 if there is nothing else
which causes swapping.
