What kind of comment do you want ?
What are the requirements to go in 2.6.24 instead of 2.6.25 ?
Is a bug correction enough ? :-P
This patch correct a bad behavior of x86_emulate_insn() in case of error with a 
REP prefix.
This patch is needed because, without it, when REP prefix is used with an 
instruction failing for some reasons (like IO or page fault) we don't restore 
all modified registers (like RSI and RDI), but only ECX and EIP, so when we 
re-enter in x86_emulate_insn() we modify again an already modified value. 
Moreover, this patch manages correctly the case where the instruction fails in 
writeback().
