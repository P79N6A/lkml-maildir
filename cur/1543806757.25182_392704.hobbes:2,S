Completely incompatible? For years, cdrecord works with it and it only
prints an utterly silly warning and also has a trivial bug in the scanning
code, causing it to stop too early.

If this is reason, I will send you a patch fixing the trivial bugs and
annoyances, sparing you the work.
				Have a nice fortnight
