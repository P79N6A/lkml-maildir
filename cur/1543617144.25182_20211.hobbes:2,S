$ apt-cache search kernel-image | grep 2.4.17
kernel-image-2.4.17-386 - Linux kernel image for version 2.4.17 on 386.

Aunt Tillie's distro autodetects her processor type and installs the
appropriate image. Aunt Tillie's distro provides precompiled,
preconfigured, modular kernels which require no configuration. Aunt
Tillie clicks on the "check for software updates" icon on her desktop
and her distro installs security fixes, new software, and a new kernel.
Aunt Tillie doesn't even have to _know_ she needs a better VM.
