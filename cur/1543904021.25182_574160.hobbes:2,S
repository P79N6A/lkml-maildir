The SuSE boot sequence is rather long. Which part (and which version) are we talking about?
As Andi said, putting a 'set -x' into /init script generated by /sbin/mkinitrd
is one thing. You can also boot with 'linuxrc=trace' to generate a huge
amount of udev and /init debug.
Booting with 'confirm' will allow you to step each runlevel script, see
/etc/init.d/boot, look for DO_CONFIRM=.
My Email provider kicked me off of lkml, so I dont have the rest of this
thread at hand.
