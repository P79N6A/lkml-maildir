There is a problem with the hfs filesystem in the stable tree. Mounting
an hfs disk with the apfd option causes problems. You should be able to
use the unbin command that comes with netatalk to extract a macbinary
file but it seg faults. Also sharing these disks with netatalk and
accessing them from a macintosh causes the session to close. This has
been tested with MacOS 7.5.3, 7.6.1, 8.6.
While keeping the same netatalk version (netatalk-1.4b2+asun2.1.3) I
tried the following kernels. All of the kernels were compiled with gcc
2.7.2.3.
Kernel Version		hfs -o afpd works
2.1.132				YES
2.2.8				YES
2.2.9				NO
2.2.10				NO
2.2.11				NO
2.2.12				NO
2.2.13				NO
Thanks,
Ricardo Muggli
