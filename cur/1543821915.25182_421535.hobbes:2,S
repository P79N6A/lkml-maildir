Hello John,
The COMMAND_LINE_SIZE should be fixed 256 bytes for boot
protocol < 2.02.
For boot protocol >= 2.02 it can be null terminated 256 and up.
From LILO code I can see that COMMAND_LINE_SIZE is defined
in lilo.h, so I don't understand how a change in the
COMMAND_LINE_SIZE of the kernel affect LILO.
What we want to achieve is a kernel capable of accepting
command line size greater than 256 bytes... It is OK if LILO
will still pass 256 byte buffer as it already does.
Can you think of a reason why LILO will not work if we do
that? (lilo.h keeps #define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE 256).
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
