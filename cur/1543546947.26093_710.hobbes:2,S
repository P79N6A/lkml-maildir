	From a Rational intranet page:
Question: Are we planning a release of Purify for Linux?
Answer: Rational has announced intent to support Linux on IA64. This
release is at least a year out and we have not committed or announced
any schedules at this time. Please let us know what customers are
interested in Purify, Quantify or PureCoverage for Linux, and what
version of Linux (vendor & platform, e.g. RedHat SPARC or SUSE x86)
they are interested in us supporting so we can add them to our
database.
