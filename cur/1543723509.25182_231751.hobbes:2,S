Hello,
We did some additional tests, and just learned that the underlying raid
itsself is not cached by the linux kernel:
bear:~/readcachetest# ./readcache /dev/cciss/c0d0p2 1000
frist run needed 16.006950 seconds, this is 62.472863 MBytes/Sec
second run needed 15.919336 seconds, this is 62.816690 MBytes/Sec
third run needed 15.830325 seconds, this is 63.169897 MBytes/Sec
So we now think it's some problem of the cciss driver, and not of lvm.
weird...
Markus
