Note that you really should look at what DRI did with the 3dfx driver,
that does all of this =and= tries to keep much of the context locking in
user space (so that only on clashes does it go to the kernel to fix things
up).
The kernel side is in the standard 2.3.x kernel these days, the X server
side is in the unofficial 3dfx X server.
