Subject: [2.6] Missing _raw_write_trylock for PPC/SMP

The PPC/32 architecture is missing the SMP definition of the 
_raw_write_trylock
function.  I'm not strong enough on PowerPC assembly but it would be 
nice if
someone could write up an implementation for 
linux/include/asm-ppc/spinlock.h
Cheers,
