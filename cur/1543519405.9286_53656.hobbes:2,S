} Has anyone thought of adding a feature of disabling the infamous
} Intel Pentium III processor serial number, which any application

} the PSN can be disabled (part 3.3, disabling PSN) with a single
} CPUID call, until next reboot. This could be configured with
} /proc/sys/kernel entry, writing 1 would disable the PSN. Any
} subsequent calls would be ignored.
