Hi,
sorry for the delay - I've been busy last week and couldn't get to your
problem. So, I couldn't reproduce the bug here with a Phenom II and your
kernel config. However, we have a working theory, so can you please send
me the output of
xxd /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/APIC
Also, can you boot a 64-bit, HZ1000 kernel on your machine?
