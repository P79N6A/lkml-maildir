No. This actually reverts to someof the original behaviour, because REALLY
previously we had exactly the old behaviour for the so-called fast
interrupts. 
In between we had the "no priorities" version,

Actually, I think it's more that they _think_ they consider the OS in
their designs.
A lot of operating systems are designed around priority levels because
that is how a lot of early hardware worked.. And because a lot of OS's
have that notion, the hardware tends to be designed for it. A bad circle.
