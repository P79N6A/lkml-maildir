Make sure you do not use either matroxfb or XFree's driver... Same chip
ID, but different ramdac :-(

For some strange reason X thinks that you have 24MB of memory on the G450.
You can either create 32MB write-combining region at 0xd4000000, or
teach X that your device occupies 32MB and not 24 (you should do it anyway,
region size can be only power of two)...
