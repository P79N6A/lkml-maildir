Oh, I see, I misunderstood the purpose of the tag - I assumed it would
mark an __init function that is known to only be referenced from init-only
code paths inside non-init functions (i.e. I didn't pay attention that the
resulting section's name is .text.init.refok, not .init.text.refok).
I have to admit I have some difficulty understanding when the tags
are going to be useful the way they are implemented right now.

I don't think so - it is my understanding that this is the body of a thread
that never dies.
