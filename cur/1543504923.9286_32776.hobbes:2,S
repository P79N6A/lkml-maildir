I don't know why the ISDN people just do not ever GET IT.
I refuse to get huge patches every time two weeks before a feature freeze.
How hard is that to understand?
I will continue to ignore the ISDN CVS tree. If the ISDN people cannot get
their act together and actually start sending their fixes to the standard
kernel in a timely manner, I cannot be bothered with it. This has
continued for something like five years now, and every time I explain it
to people my explanation gets lost or ignored.

It's not about sending "a patch".
It's about being a responsible programmer, and making sure I get MORE than
just a patch every f*cing time I anounce a code freeze. I should have been
getting patches for the last half year, and I have gotten ZERO. And I'm
irritated at the ISDN peopl, because this is not the first time. In fact,
I have never EVER gotten a single responsible ISDN developer that stands
up and says "ok, I'll be the maintainer of this, and I'll make sure it
gets fed to Linus in a timely manner".
You still wonder why ISDN is not there? Do you still wonder why I'm fed up
with ISDN people who think they they can just force-feed me one huge patch
and completely avoid any QA in the meantime?
WHY, oh why, is the ONLY time I ever hear from ISDN people when I have
publically announced a code-freeze? Explain that,
		Linus
