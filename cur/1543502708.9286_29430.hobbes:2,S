True... when I said "avoids" above, I didn't mean that this should be
postponed indefinitely: just that I'd like for there to be continuity
in the kernel interfaces rather than major reorganizations that break
existing code.  And so the changes can be done piecewise.

There is already some such code in the PCI drivers that have been
adapted to handle CardBus devices.  I wrote the API with some
attention to what might be useful for a more general device manager,
but it should be given more thought.

For PCMCIA/CardBus devices, the issue is moot: I provide configuration
tools that manipulate devices based on what or where they are, rather
than their device names / minor numbers.  So a config script describes
how to configure "the ethernet card in socket 0", or "the ethernet
card with hw address xx:yy:zz:aa:bb:cc" or "the IDE drive with serial
number 1234567".
