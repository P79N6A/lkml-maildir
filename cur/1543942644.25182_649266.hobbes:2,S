> ooh, a fellow t61p owner.  How's suspend and resume working?
I spent days getting it to work. I'm not an expert and don't know if made
any poor decisions, I tested suspend to ram in a bunch of configurations and
finally got it to work consistently. I think I have to restart the network
after resume, but I'm okay with that. Some things that may be of interest:
2.6.18-53.1.4.e15.centos.plus with native nvidia drivers
in /etc/grub.conf:
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-53.1.4.el5.centos.plus ro agp=off
root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet
in /ext/X11/xorg.conf:

    Driver         "nvidia"
