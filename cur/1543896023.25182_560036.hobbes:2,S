Even in our last version I didn't understand clearly why you had
pointers from the bottom layers to the topmost layer. Could you please
explain under what circumstances there needs to be a bottom to top
traversal ?

The second list headed at mnt->mnt_union was added precisely  to get
rid of all the union_mounts under a vfsmount at umount time. So umount
is the time to destroy the union stack.

The idea was to start simple, get some feedback and concensus and add
features after that. Some of the feedback I got from our last two
posts was that the code was too complex and big to review and we had
so many patches. So this time I have started with the bare minimum so
that it becomes easier for the reviewers. I plan to add copyup and
whiteout only when there is an agreement that this approach of
unioning is acceptable.
And about readdir, I digressed from your approach a bit and made
readdir cache persistant across readdir()/getdents() calls. Also, made
readdir on union mounted directories filesystem independent unlike our
earlier approach. But again this breaks lseek as I have noted, which
needs to be fixed.
Regards,
Bharata.
