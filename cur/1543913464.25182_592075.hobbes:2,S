License is only a promise not to sue. Only original author is permitted to
sue in BSD/GPL case. David seems right here.
If Linus releases GPL/BSD program, you choose GPL and distribute it to
me, and I put it into proprietary evil app, I am _ok_.
You can't sue me, because you are not copyright holder.
Linus can't sue me, because he BSD licensed it.
=> I'm fine. Yep, copyright law is strange, and you may be right
outside U.S.
