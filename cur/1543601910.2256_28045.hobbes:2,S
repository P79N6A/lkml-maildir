Immediately after a crash, the fs will be OK.  But during the
subsequent background raid reconstruction, it can get out of sync
again.  This can result in silent data loss in some cases, but it is
also likely to trigger some internal ext3 debugging which detects
out-of-order data writes, resulting in a kernel panic.
Cheers,
