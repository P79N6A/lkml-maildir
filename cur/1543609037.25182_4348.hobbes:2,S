You must have forgotten about 2.5 which should serve as a transitional 
period just fine. By the time 2.6.0 is about to be released I'll be damned 
if init scripts and the rest proc related hadn't made their transition.
What was said there about making a transition for the better and M$ dlls 
aswell as ELF binary format and libc4, I'd say ditch it even if we planned
to jump from 2.4 directly to 2.6.
