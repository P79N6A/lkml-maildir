[Please include me (turbo@nocrew.org) in any public replies]
I just bought  a new SCSI card (AHA-2940U2W) to drive  my two, new U2W
SCSI disks that I bought over a couple of months. Previously I had the
system on a  6.4Gb Narrow SCSI. Togheter with a  Narrow CD-ROM, it was
driven by a AHA-2940 card. With  that setup I NEVER had a SCSI related
problem, but now, with the  new card/disks, I get SCSI hangs, constant
SCSI resets etc...
I  have tried  a number  of different  kernels (2.3.5-acX,  2.3.23 and
latest with the 2.2.14-pre9) and they all act the same.
I tried the stuff in the drivers/scsi/README.aic7xxx, but when booting
with  a rescue disk  with the  2.2.14-pre9 kernel,  I don't  get those
reset loops that I was expecting (read hoping :) for.
I have  tried every different  SCSI-BIOS option, disk  jumper settings
etc, but to no avail.
What happens is  that if I boot with a  properly shutdown system (ie,
FS is clean), I get this:
-----
Partition check:
 sda: sda1 sda2 < sda5 sda6 >
 sdb: sdb1 sdb2 sdb3 < sdb5 sdb6 sdb7 sdb8 sdb9 sdb10 >
 hdc: hdc1
<-- here I get about 10 sec delay -->
SCSI : aborting command due to timeout : pid 60, scsi1, channel 0, id 0,
lun 0 Read (6) 00 00 41 02 00
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
-----
I _ALWAYS_ get the timeout, and  the numbers are always the same (what
are they  by the  way?). It  usually comes online,  but after  a while
(different timespan each time) it starts reseting the bus (looping).
If on the other hand I have  been forced to cycle the power, it passes
the hdc disk, then starts 'the SCSI reset loop', never comming online.
I've tried with  only the U2W card, with one disk  (which now have the
system on  it), the disk plugged  in into different  connectors on the
cable,  using  the  external  LVD/SE  terminator  (at  the  very  last
connector of course :) or  having the disk terminated (jumper setting,
naturaly without the external terminator :).
I can not  totaly rule out that it's the cables  fault, but it's brand
new  (came with  the previous  U2W card,  a Tekram,  which  I replaced
because I thought that was the problem. I got the same thing with that
card to).
To be able to give as much info as possible, I booted with the verbose
and  panic_on_abort kernel  parameters, and  have enclosed  the output
from that below.
This is my configuration:
	scsi0:	AHA-2940
		ID0:	Quantum Fireball SE6.4S	(Narrow disk, 6.4Gb)
		ID1:	Toshiba XM-5701TA	(CD-ROM)
	scsi1:	AHA-2940U2W
		ID0:	IBM DNES-309170D	(Ultra2 LVD/SE disk, 9Gb)
		ID1:	IBM DDRS-39130D		(Ultra2 LVD/SE disk, 9Gb)
	ide1:	Quantum Fireball EX10.2A	(EIDE disk, 10Gb, /dev/hdc)
		OTI-SCYLLA			(ATAPI-CDROM, /dev/hdd)
	Booting from scsi0/0, with root on scsi1/0.
The reason  for having the primary  IDE channel disabled  (in BIOS) is
the boot priority problem, and the info  on that is to be moved to the
DDRS disk, totaly removing all IDE disks.
As  stated  above,  I  have  tried  to  disconnect  EVERYTHING  (other
expansion  cards,  IDE units  etc)  but the  U2W  card,  and the  DNES
disk.  The reason  for two  cards  (the U2W  card also  have a  Narrow
channel), is  that I suspected (read  wanted to rule out)  that it had
problems  on using  both  the  Ultra2 LVD/SE  channel  AND the  Narrow
channel at the same time. Doesn't  seem to be that problem, so I guess
I don't need the Narrow card. No loss, could be sold :)
This is  the output when  booting with the verbose  and panic_on_abort
kernel options:
