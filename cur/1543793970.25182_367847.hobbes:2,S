That would be wierd, just drop the sysctl stuff.

True.

If you want to write one, sure :)
But you can just probably use a udev rule to initialize your things
properly, that's what all of the distros are now using.

sysfs and the driver model are woefully underdocumented.  Right now, I'd
recommend the Linux Device Drivers, third edition, free online if you
don't want to buy it, for anyone doing any driver core stuff.  It has a
whole chapter that is the most up-to-date and the best description I've
seen so far.
But even then, it is out of date, due to api changes, sorry.
