 From looking at your status file, I can't tell if you've implemented  
the PowerMac IDE support yet (Based on your email's mention of x86- 
only, I'm guessing not).  If/when you do get that support done, I'd  
be more than happy to test it for you on my PPC boxen.  Overall this  
work looks very nice, thanks!

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
