/proc/kcore is an ELF format file (try using objdump(1) to read
headers from it).
The data within the file may be sparse (especially on discontig
and NUMA systems).  So the size just represents the end of
the highest addressed memory section.  E.g. on my desktop:
$ ls -l /proc/kcore
-r--------  1 root root 4611686019496083456 Oct 25 09:52 /proc/kcore
