Hi all,
i have a WDT-3 PCI watchdog card. It has also a serial port interface. All work fine with serial but on PCI i can't found the driver. 
If i do lspci i can't found nothing about WDT so i ask: If thereisn't the driver for a PCI card i can't have information from lspci?
Thank and sorry for my english :-)
