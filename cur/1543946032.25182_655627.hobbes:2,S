This means it generates faster code with a current gcc for your platform.
But a future gcc might e.g. replace the whole loop with a division
(gcc SVN head (that will soon become gcc 4.3) already does 
transformations like replacing loops with divisions [1]).
And your __builtin_expect() then might have unwanted effects on gcc.
Or the kernel code changes much but the likely/unlikely stays unchanged
although it becomes wrong.
If it is a real hotpath in the kernel where you have _measurable_ 
performance advantages from using likely/unlikely it's usage might be 
justified, but otherwise it shouldn't be used.

[1] e.g. the while() loop in timespec_add_ns() in include/linux/time.h
    gets replaced by a division and a modulo (whether this 
    transformation is correct in this specific case is a different
    question, but that's the level of code transformation gcc already 
    does today)
