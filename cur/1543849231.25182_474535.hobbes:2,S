Fedora Core 6 is already shipping with the output of 'make
headers_install'. This means that in general, if userspace is
misbehaving and it's something we ship in Fedora Core, Extras or Livna,
we're going to have fixed it up already. So Fedora CVS is a good place
to look, although such fixes all should have been pushed upstream rather
than just languishing in our packages.
