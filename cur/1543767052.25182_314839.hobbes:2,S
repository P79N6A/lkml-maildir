Maybe you should mail current maintainer before spreading FUD?
No functionality was removed AFAIK, see the patches.  I spend quite 
a bit of time making sure that nothing breaks up (I missed one special
case but somebody already posted patch to LKML fixing it).
These patches were posted at least two times to both linux-ide and
linux-kernel, they were in -mm for ages - were you hiding under the
rock?

This was discussed few times already.
Alan, seriously, what is your problem?
