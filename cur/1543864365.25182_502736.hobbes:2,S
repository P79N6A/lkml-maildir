Pavel, the submitted patch was not meant for production use: it still suffers
of the time-warp problem. To fix it I need to know when the system goes to
sleep/resumes. In SIN I've solved via the platform driver, introducing
suspend() resume() callbacks. What do you think about?
   The /proc/bus/input/devices has an extensible structure. You can just
   add an "A:" line (for Activity) instead of adding a new proc file.
I know, but IMO there is too much stuff to parse in there. Activity counters
are frequently accessed by daemons, and four or five concurrent daemons are the
norm in a typical X11 linux box...
   Anyway, I believe this should be also available through sysfs, if not
   only there.
Pavel gives me clearance for only bits of code, so I've recycled something
already done. No problem for me to switch /sys.
   Also, the activity counters should IMO coincide with the event times
   passed through /dev/input/event, and should not be jiffies based.
   Ideally, both should be based on clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC).
In evdev.c do_gettimeofday() is used. Anyway I just need of a monotonic
counter, so get_jiffies_64() wouldn't be better? It isn't affected by wrapping
issues and it is probably faster than do_gtod().
Best,
