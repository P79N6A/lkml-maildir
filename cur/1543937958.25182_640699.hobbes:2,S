Subject: [PATCH] Remove information leak in Linux CIFS client

Fix information leak in CIFS client lookup
Putting arbitary file names on lookup failures into the system log is not
a good idea, because usually everybody can read dmesg and that is thus
an information leak if a directory was read protected.
Also changed the error printout for this case to a signed number, because
it is normally negative and that makes it easier to read.
I'm not sure the message is all that useful anyways. Perhaps it 
should be just removed completely? Or at least rate limited because
it allows to spam the kernel log nicely.
