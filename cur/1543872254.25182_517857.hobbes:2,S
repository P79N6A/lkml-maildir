This was taken into consideration, and I did reply that my concern for
doing that could cause stale data in the skb if the queue mapping
changed.  If a qdisc was implemented that could change the band to queue
mapping without having to reload the qdisc, the result could have skb's
heading for the wrong queues until the old data was drained from the
bands.  An example:
->enqueue() - maps queue, commits to skb, adds to band
netif_stop_queue(dev) - event is triggered that could cause a qdisc to
remap bands to queues, drain hardware queues
netif_wake_queue(dev) - reconfiguration is complete, resume transmission
->dequeue() - grab an skb enqueued prior to reconfiguration, read queue
from skb, hard_start_xmit() to the wrong queue
