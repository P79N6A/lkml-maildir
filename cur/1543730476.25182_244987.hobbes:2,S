It's networking trying to allocate eight physically-contiguous pages with
GFP_ATOMIC.  Can you say "snowball's chance in hell"?
Probably we should kill off those noisy printk's, or make them dependent on
some debugging option.  But we keep on finding quite serious cases, such as
this one.
Sure, networking will recover from memory allocation failures - presumably
by dropping a packet.  But if it's doing frequent atomic 3-order allocations
then it will end up dropping a *lot* of packets, and performance will suffer.
