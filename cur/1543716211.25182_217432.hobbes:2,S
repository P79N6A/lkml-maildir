You would probably be better off trying a simpler change
first actually:
in mm/vmscan.c, shrink_list(), change:
if (res == WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE) {
	ClearPageReclaim(page);
	goto activate_locked;
}
to
if (res == WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE) {
	ClearPageReclaim(page);
	goto keep_locked;
}
I think it is not the correct solution, but should narrow
down your problem. Let us know how it goes.
