Sorry, I had forgot these two ones from previous series. I've found a bug in
startup code (related to new code in 2.6.17) and here's the fix - it is not a
"just fix this", there's a tiny bit of reorganization but not much (splitting
functions and changing their return conventions).
From stg series:
+ uml-not_dead_yet-remove-existing-dir   | uml: fix not_dead_yet when
	directory is in bad state
+ uml-rename-improve-actually_do_remove  | uml: rename and improve
	actually_do_remove()

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
