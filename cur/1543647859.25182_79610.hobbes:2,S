       This is the fourth and last time I submit this patch to Marcelo.
   This little tiny bug is fixed in all trees except the official one. I
   think this patch is trivial enough to be accepted, but...
Patches tend to get accepted when you attach an analysis
of the bug you are fixing.
I cannot even figure out what the failure case is that you are
fixing which actually occurs.
I bet if you explain this, Marcelo will take your fix.
