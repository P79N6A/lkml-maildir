My configuration manager supports this already... It has to... certain
configuration protocols (PCI, PnP, PnP-BIOS) specify what I/O and memory
ranges are possible for a device.

I've got support for this too...

And this as well...

So, if you don't mind me asking, do you have any particular reasons for not
wanting to use my configuration manager? Or is there anything I can do to
improve it that would make it acceptable?
