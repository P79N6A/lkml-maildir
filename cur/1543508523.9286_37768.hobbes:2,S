Ive had a few problems with the hpt366, it wasnt performing as expected
so i fried its BIOS as punishment !  (but thats another story)
Anyway, i have a quantum KA, i was getting into the 17MB/s with after 
playing with config, so 16MB/s seems reasonable. I think youl find that
ATA 33 / ATA 66 doesnt make much difference.
You should expect your 5400 drive to be a fair bit slower than yout 7200,
my 5400 gets 13MB/s
So your results look ok to me, what were you expecting ?
