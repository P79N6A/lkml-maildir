Indeed, there's still a lot of optimization to be done.  I've recently made
some improvements recently which will reduce the memory use (and speed
things up) for a few of the worst-performing commands.  No improvement to
the initial record, but on the plus side, that's only done once.  But I was
able to cut down the memory used checking out a kernel repository to 500m.
(Which, sadly enough, is a major improvement.)
You would do much better if you recorded the initial state one directory at
a time, since it's the size of the largest changeset that determines the
memory use on checkout, but that's ugly.

Indeed, I do believe that darcs has a way to go before it'll perform
acceptably on the kernel.  On the other hand, tar seems to perform
unacceptably slow on the kernel, so I'm not sure how slow is too slow.
Definitely input from interested kernel developers on which commands are
too slow would be welcome.
