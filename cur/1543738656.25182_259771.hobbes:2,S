Well, the tasks can escape out of the domain iff you have the 
SD_LOAD_BALANCE flag set on that domain.  If SD_LOAD_BALANCE isn't set,
then when the scheduler tick goes off, and the code looks at the domain,
it will see the lack of the flag and will not attempt to balance the
domain, correct?  This is what we currently do with the 'isolated'
domains, right?
You're right that you can get some of the more obscure semantics of the
various flavors of cpusets by leveraging sched_domains AND
cpus_allowed.  I don't have any desire to remove that ability, just keep
it as the exception.
