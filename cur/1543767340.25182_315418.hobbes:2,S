Actually you can look at this either way.  Consider, you ask someone to test mm and
they have not built a kernel before.  So they have to:
download a base kernel, untar it.
download a RCx patch and apply it
download the mm patch and apply it
take their current /proc/config.gz and place it in the current dir as .config
make oldconfig
make and install the kernel
using cogito in a few weeks this will translate to
install a distro package for cogito, which will probably give you the option of downloading the kernel.
export an RCx directory treedownload the mm patch and apply it
take their current /proc/config.gz and place it in the current dir as .config
make oldconfig
make and install the kernel
Which is a simpler process...   Its just different.   
BTW the most complex process, from a unexperienced user POV, is probably the 
make oldconfig as most distros automate the build and install.
There is no point in going any further with this.  We will have to see what 
happens on the SCM front.  What would be interesting is if the quilt scripts
were integrated into the SCM.  Then Andrew would just have to publish a
commit id (or quilt id?).
