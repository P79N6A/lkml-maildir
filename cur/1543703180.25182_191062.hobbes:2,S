I guess the problem is that, by default, Mandrake creates an extended partition 
when installed, where all the other partitions go.
Whenever I install Mandrake, I'm always careful to switch to "Expert" mode and 
configure the partitions to be primary by hand to avoid this kind of problems.
If you are a corageous hacker, you can always:
  - boot from a CD distribution (knoppix, etc.)
  - run fdisk on your hard drive
  - take note on the cylinders being used by the partitions,
  - delete the partitions on the extended partition, and the extended partition 
itself
  - create the partitions again as primary using the *exact* same cylinders
  - write the partition to disk
  - reboot
Probably you'll have to adjust fstab to use the new partitions, but at least 2.4 
and 2.6 should both agree that you have an hda :)
I don't know if you'll need to run lilo again before rebooting, but I would do 
that just to be on the safe side. To do that:
  - mount /dev/hda somewhere (/mnt/disk or something)
  - # cd /mnt/disk
  - edit etc/lilo.conf to always use /dev/hda
  - # chroot . lilo
I hope this helps,
