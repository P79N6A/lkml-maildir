I have a full strace at

That's because nobody else was there overnight, to prompt the NT box to drop
your connection.  At least, that's my hunch.

You can see this directly from the strace I posted.  The faulty debug output
goes to fd 1, which is variously opened and closed as the program runs
(since smbmount initially closed it).  Finally, this results in an uncaught
SIGPIPE.
This is due to a simple typo or thinko in the preprocessor directives.  See
my other message.  When corrected, smbmount works works with the default
#define's.
(BTW, in one case there is an EPIPE on a write to this fd, without a
SIGPIPE.  Is that ok?)
