I've come to the conclusion that pissing about with modelines with the
framebuffer drivers are a pain in the butt (trying to get framebuffer to
display a 1280x1024 graphic console perfectly is not fun when the display
is all arsed up and you end up using the monitor's buttons to adjust it)
I'm sure there are a lot of monitors out there that supports the DDC (Data
Display Channel) protocol. With this in mind, an extension to the generic
framebuffer driver to support DDC might be a nice thing to have, and it
would obviate the need to adjust the display manually. 
XFree86 3.3.3.1 seems to get it right - it supports DDC. 
Are there any current plans to introduce DDC to the framebuffer drivers?
If not, I'd like to try and implement it [I have the XFree86 sources so
not a problem].
Cheers, 
Alex
