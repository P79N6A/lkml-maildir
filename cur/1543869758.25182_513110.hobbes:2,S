This should cause *no* blink. It is setting brightness to zero anyway, which
is all ibm-acpi cares about (without a patch I will be sending in soon).
And ibm-acpi doesn't issue hardware calls that would not change the
brightness value.
If a brightness value query is causing blinks on your thinkpad, something is
very weird.
Maybe something else is also getting these events and processing them?
