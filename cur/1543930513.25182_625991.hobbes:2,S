Semaphores can be used to signal completion of a job, but aren't the
optimal way to do so. According to LDD3 semaphores are optimized for
the 'available' case and performance suffers when using them as
completion. 
It is also clearer to use each synchronization mechanism according to
its purpose, i.e. semaphores for protection of critical sections and
completions for signalling that a job is done.
