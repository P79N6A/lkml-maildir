Hrm... I see. Well, I was using it from the driver because I have a
driver that needs to wait in it's probe() routing for another driver to
show up for another device (they are linked in some ways, but that is
not expressed via bus bindings).
I suppose I'll just have probe() fire off a kthread instead.
Cheers,
Ben.
