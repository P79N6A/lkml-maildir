we moved away from using a timer and using a workqueue now. It wrote the
patch to use a workqueue and tested that it works. Starting with 2.6.19
we the usage of a workqueue is default. Can you verify that non of the
kernels 2.6.19-2.6.23 are working. We might have missed a change inside
the USB subsystem within the 2.6.24 timeframe.
