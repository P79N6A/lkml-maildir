I confirm this! The important thing is the MTU. Even with MTU set to 527
(or whatever) the systems fails to forward... but not completely... I mean
that with MTU 527 the masquaraded hosts manage to see outside to the www
but only some hosts, some still not work, for example www.uu.net works but
www.hotmail.com doesn't. etc...
And, YES, changing the PPP MTU to 1500 fixes this misbehaviour... I noticed 
this problem since 2.0.32 (before that I don't know).
