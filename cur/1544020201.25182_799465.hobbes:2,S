I know, it's weird ... it's like the compiler is copying to the lvalue
but then discarding the result somehow ... with the direct assignment,
we end up with nothing in cpu_possible_bits, then the smp alternatives
switch to UP and all hell breaks loose when multiple CPUs are brought
up.
I think the problem is that cpu_possible_mask isn't an alias for
cpu_possible_bits, so when I update the former directly it breaks the
correspondence set up in kernel/cpu.c ... your declaration of it as
*const looks to be causing the compiler to do this.
Thus, I think direct assignment to cpu_possible_map (and hence
cpu_possible_mask) should be forbidden.

That's OK ... Voyager is one of those platforms that tends to come off
worst on updates, so I'm used to sweeping up around it.
