Subject: Problem getting LinkSys Combo PCMCIA EthernetCard to work on 2.2.x

Subject pretty much says it all.  I have a laptop (an AMS Tech
TravelPro 2500) with a 10mb/s LinkSys Combo PCMCIA EthernetCard which
I used with no trouble at all with all versions of Linux 2.0.  As soon
as I started with 2.2 (and pcmcia-3.0.9) the card just stopped
working.  The card comes up and appears to work fine (two high beeps
and the eth0 device gets configured properly) but no packets get in or
out.
The following lines appear in my syslog which might give a clue (this
was immediately after trying to do a ping):
eth0: NE2000 Compatible: io 0x300, irq 10, hw_addr 00:E0:98:05:BF:0B
eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3, ISR=0x17, t=830.
eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3, ISR=0x17, t=2500.
(Nothing else is trying to use irq 10, btw; I checked.)
Any ideas?  This happens with all post-2.0 versions of Linux up to
2.2.11 and 2.3.9, and up to pcmcia-3.0.14.  The very same hardware
worked like a charm with RedHat 5.1 (which was kernel 2.0.34 and
pcmcia-3.0.0) and it also works great with NetBSD 1.4.  Only post-2.0
linux is giving me pain.
