Hi Andrew,
Testing with all delay-accounting patches as been in your 2.6.27-mm3
tree as of 6/26 afternoon (ie, including the send-tgid-once, and
avoid-sending-without-listeners patches), i do not see measurable
performance difference with and without tgid processing when the
exit rate was controlled to around 1000 exit/sec.
As a result i am OK to not include a design of a system-wise
init-time configuration option (for per-thread group data processing)
in the taskstats interface.
The ENOBUFS i experienced in my testing would start to happen
when exit rate at around 14000 exits/sec. While our fields confirmed
that a 1000 threads exit/sec was a real, i have no reason to be
concerned of 14000 exits/sec rate. ;)
Regards,
 - jay
