Alan,
I agree with your basic sentiment, but the issue here is that supporting
TOE requires changes that are very intimate to the kernel. This is not
like developing I2O which is an edge driver layer, but a core portion
of the kernel.  Some support from the community is going to be needed. 
Currently, any time someone mentions the idea of discussing a TOE 
interface, it's shot down as being evil and bad. 
/me thinks that the HW vendors that really want TOE support need
 to fund some Linux networking folks to go look at the problem
 in detail.
