I'm seeing a similar effect myself. When I use all my available sdsl
bandwidth (say doing a bulk data transfer), DNS lookups will often
time out. This is with the default buffer settings/2.4.4. 
I'm curious about this effect so I've been trying to find information
on this and while I can find lots of information on the Ethernet
capture effect there doesn't seem to be anything on the TCP capture
effect. Could someone point me at an explanation of this effect?
Thanks
