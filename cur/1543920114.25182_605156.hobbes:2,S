I know.

I gave it about half an hour, then it locked solid and stopped writing to the 
disk at all.  (I gave it another 5 minutes at that point, then held down the 
power button.)
Lost about 50 open konqueror tabs...

2 gigs, same as ram.

Two words: "Software suspend".  I've actually been thinking of increasing it 
on the next install...

I tend to lower "swappiness" and when that happens all sorts of stuff goes 
weird.  Software suspend used to say says it can't free enough memory if I 
put swappiness at 0 (dunno if it still does).  This time the OOM killer never 
triggered before hard deadlock.  (I think I had it around 20 or 40 or some 
such.)

*shrug* It might.  I was a letting it run hoping it would complete itself when 
it locked solid.  (The keyboard LEDs weren't flashing, so I don't _think_ it 
paniced.  I was in X so I wouldn't have seen a message...)
(To be honest, I can never remember how to trigger sysrq on a laptop keyboard.  
Presumably X won't intercept it the way it does alt-f1 and ctrl-alt-del...)
