  Hmm, I mostly submit patches by hand but I'll try to not forget generate
patches with git-diff --stat ;).

  We can definitely split out ext3 and JBD changes (although ext3 would not
compile after JBD changes). I'll have a look at what Mingming suggests -
whether we could make both modes coexist reasonably easily. In that case also
patches could change smaller chunks.
