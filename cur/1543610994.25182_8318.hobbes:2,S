Add the following line to "/etc/modules.config":
	alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1
and then:
	# /sbin/depmod -ae
You need this because your module is named "emu10k1" but the sound system is
looking for a module named "sound-slot-0" (this is a computed module name, not
an actual name).

You don't need to mess with that.  Just:
	# echo 5 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
anytime you want.  Of course, since Step-1 above fixed your original problem,
you won't need to do this at all ;-)
