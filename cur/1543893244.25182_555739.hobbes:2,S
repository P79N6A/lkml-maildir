Hi,
Doesn't this move printk-debug control from local source files
(i.e., targeted, specific ones) to a more global control (DEBUG)?
If so, I don't see that as a generally good thing.
If not, please correct me and tell me how this is useful to just
one instance of using pr_debug() in say, ncpfs, without pr_debug()
being enabled throughout the entire kernel tree.
Thanks.
