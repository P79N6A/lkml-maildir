Hi Jeff,
Don't see a fix for this issue in your tree, although i think someone
else may have already reported this.   Just thought better safe than
sorry and report perhaps again that rc4 can't boot here because the
sata drives can not be found.  Reverting commit 464cf177 fixes the
problem.
As an aside, booting the patch-reverted rc4 does not resolve the other
issue I just reported to the list[1] (sorry for not cc'ing you).
Cheers.
Sean
