Tried now.

Here the load never goes over 25. There are always 35mbyte of swap used
with 128Mbyte of ram (I am using egcs-1.1.1 btw). So I guess that the
problem of pre9 you are reporting is the VM and nothing related to the
scheduler (maybe not?). 
I am writing this with the machine under load and here inside pine ;) it's
responsive as when it was idle.

Here with a double-PII 450Mhz but with 1 sloww IDE hd (6mbyte sec
reported by hdparm -t /dev/hda, seek time is far worse ;). Everything is
in the same phys HD and there's only two partitions one for the swap and
one for ext2 (rootfs).

I suggest you to try out my:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.0-pre9_arca-2.gz
It's against 2.2.0-pre9 and has also my latest VM in it.

I am not sure to have understood well but if the page is been throw out
from the swap cache it means that the page is gone and so it will be
difficult to mark the page PG_recently_swapped_in ;). But we could use the
same logic with a bit in the swap entry to handle that (we have 6 custom
bit to use and only one is used right now, and it's SHM_SWP_TYPE).
But I don't think it's the right approch. The swap_cache should just be
able to throw out only the right pages. See below ...

Eric, it's important infact. I am handling aging in the swap cache here.
That's an _important_ point for performances. I don't remeber if I pointed
out this before.
