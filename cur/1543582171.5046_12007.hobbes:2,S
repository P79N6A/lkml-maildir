Hello,
I have problems using my scanner (HP C6270A connected to ncr53c810a)
with xsane.
I always get the error message:
error during read: Error during device I/O
Feb 15 23:57:27 localhost kernel: Attached scsi generic sg2 at scsi0,
channel 0, id 4, lun 0, type 3

Feb 15 23:58:04 localhost kernel: ncr53c810a-0: restart (scsi reset).
With kernel 2.2.x I have no problems accessing the scanner with xsane.
Any idea?
