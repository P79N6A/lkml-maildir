I take it that this is after a normal shutdown where you are sure that
the filesystem was unmounted cleanly?  It looks like a case where these
files are deleted, but held open by a process.
Could you please try the following:
- "telinit 1" to change into single user mode
- make sure all of the above processes are stopped (check via ps, and
  "/etc/rc.d/init.d/foo stop" for each one
- "lsof | grep /var" to see if any files are still open on /var
- umount /var
- e2fsck -f /dev/hdX
Cheers, Andreas
