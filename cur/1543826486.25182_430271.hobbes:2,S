It might be good to define CONFIG_IS_TICK_BASED for the other ARM arches
so they continue to build after your changes. Otherwise it looks good to
me.
Another aside: CONFIG_IS_TICK_BASED also goes away w/ the Cx series. So
there you will want to conditionally enable GENERIC_TIME if you have a
clocksources defined and just wrap the old get/set_timeofday() w/ ifndef
CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME until all the sub-arches have been converted. Don't
worry too much, I'll lend a hand here when the time comes to update -rt,
so it shouldn't be much of an issue.
thanks
