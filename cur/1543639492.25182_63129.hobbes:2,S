That's a big fat bug.   And it wouldn't be astonishing if my
shiny new readahead does the same thing - I haven't analysed/tested
this scenario.  Shall though.
Knowing zero about NFS, this:
        if (!PageError(page) && NFS_SERVER(inode)->rsize >= PAGE_CACHE_SIZE) {
                error = nfs_readpage_async(file, inode, page);
                goto out;
        }
        error = nfs_readpage_sync(file, inode, page);
would seem to indicate that it's important to have 4k or 8k rsize and
wsize.

In 2.4, /proc/sys/vm/[min|max]_readahead should affect NFS, I think.
In 2.5, no knobs yet.  NFS is using the default_backing_dev_info's
readahead setting, which isn't tunable.  It needs to create its
own backing_dev_info (probably per mount?), make each inode's
inode.i_data.backing_dev_info point at that backing_dev_info
structure and export it to userspace in some manner.  Guess I
should have told Trond that ;)

Well it's oopsing in the code which tries to work out the
device geometry:
generic_unplug_device (data=0x0) at /usr/src/25/include/asm/spinlock.h:117
117     {
(gdb) bt
#0  generic_unplug_device (data=0x0) at /usr/src/25/include/asm/spinlock.h:117

So if you use something with known geometry, like /dev/fd0h1440, it works!
