That's basically a "plug in implementation here".  Nobody's yet done
that on a platform that _uses_ the VBUS power.

Where the transceiver would then delegate to something else,
like the tps65010 driver.

... which has most certainly been on platforms which are hooked
up to draw power from VBUS.

I don't folow what you're saying.  The control flow *MUST* be that
the USB stack provides the only indication of how much power may
be drawn through the VBUS supply.  Nothing else in the system has
the knowledge of what's legal, and when.
If you want to talk about a "supplier", the way to put it might
then be that the USB stack is saying "here's N mA power for you";
it's supplying the power, not the other way around.
There's no "ask" involved, since the host controls "N".  So the
host supplies, the USB gadget stack interprets that, and some
power component must obeys.  That includes rules like reducing
VBUS draw to ~500 uA when the host suspends the USB link.
