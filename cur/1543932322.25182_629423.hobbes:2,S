The mattr infrastructure appears to do a decent job of handling the
reserved page mapping case.  It essentially reinvents struct
vm_area_struct, and so I expect we can do things a little more easily
if we use the existing vm_area_struct with it's vm_page_prot member
for our checks, all rooted at a dummy reserved page inode.  That way
we don't need to do anything special on unmap.
For normal pages we always have them in the kernel mapping and
we use them there.  change_page_attr also comes in from the AGP
drivers and changes the caching attributes on a few of those.  So when
mapping a normal page we need to require it to be write-back or
whatever change_page_attr has set it to.  I expect 2 bits 
of page->flags with the proper default can handle that.
change_page_attr needs to check non kernel mappings of a page 
and either fix them or fail.
If we perform the checks I have described for normal pages
in /dev/mem (in remap_pfn_pages?) that should be our
most difficult case handled.

Well we do want to early map the ``isa'' region.

/dev/mem is particular weird because it doesn't own the page, and thus
will always be the second user if we are talking about pages in ram.

Yes but not the way you describe below.

Part of the usefulness of /dev/mem is that it can do silly things like
map pages someone else in the kernel is using.  /dev/mem by it's very
nature does not own ram pages so we need to handle that differently.

I think some bits in page->flags should do the trick.  The semantics
of change_page_attr are interesting in this case.
