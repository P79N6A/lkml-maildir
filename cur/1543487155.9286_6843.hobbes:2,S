I have an HP Colo 4/8 IDE tape drive. My experience has ranged from poor
to mediocre, depending on kernel release, phase of moon, etc. I'm usually
able to write a tape immediately after a clean boot, but I've had a fair
number of failed backups as well as lockups, hard crashes, etc. 2.2.1
seems worse than 2.2.0pre7, based on one datapoint.
Unfortunately, I don't really have the time or skills to help debug, nor
the available cash to purchase a different drive, so I'm living with it. 
In addition to the ide-tape driver, you can use IDE-SCSI emulation and the
SCSI tape driver.
