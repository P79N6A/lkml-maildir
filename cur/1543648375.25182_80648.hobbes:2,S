Not exactly.  I'm saying that the context in which /dev/epoll is used
(at least originally), is non-blocking socket IO.  Anybody who has
worked with that API can tell you there are subtleties, and that if
they're ignored, will certainly lead to pitfalls.  These are not the
fault of the /dev/epoll interface.

I think we're talking across purposes. 
I know this is the AIO list, but I think epoll has value independent
of AIO.  They're complementary, not mutually exclusive.

I agree if you are talking about AIO as a whole.  But epoll is more
limited in its scope, it really relates only to poll()/select not the
whole IO api.
