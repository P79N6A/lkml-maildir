nilfs will remain under development for a couple of months and we'll
take a look at a 2.6.20 merge.  Can you please find time to take a
closer look during this cycle?

Well yes.  Each new filesystem (complex or not) is an additional
boatanchor on development of core kernel: block, vfs, MM, etc.  So each
filesystem should be justified on the basis that it adds sufficient
benefit to justify that cost.  (And I got mau-muaed for pointing this
out in the omfs context, I might add).
Will nilfs bring enough value to justify it's cost?  Hard call.  What
do you think?
(otoh, we could probably randomly delete ten old filesystems and
practically nobody would notice)
