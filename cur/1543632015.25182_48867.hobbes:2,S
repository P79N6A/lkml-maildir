    Hi Abraham :)

    I think that, today at least, the nvram device is almost useless,
since only a few bytes are common to all BIOS vendors. The best
solution I can think about is just the same you propose: two devices,
one for the processor builtin RTC (the TSC counter?) and another for
the usual RTC on the motherboard.
    The only ugly thing I see is the NVRam driver, which I consider
useless these days.
