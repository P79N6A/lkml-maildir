From my experience with CT stuff, the kernel support will need to be
non-existant. I've been playing with some voice-ip cards recently and they're
somewhat worrying - they don't have device drivers for the systems they
currently support (winXX). The userspace application manipulates them by
talking directly to a memory address (yeah, well dodgy), and as far as the OS
is concerned the cards don't even exist.
 Mind you, i suppose it makes it easier in porting the software to linux et al.
At least, it would be if the manufacturers would actually give me the spec on
anything (they won't even tell me what encoding they're using for the chirpy
"Welcome to this machine" etc samples which i'm trying to replace with ones in
English ;-)
