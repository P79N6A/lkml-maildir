That's not what I said. I think we do agree. I'll rephrase.
The code currently in arch/i386 and arch/x86_64 support a chipset that
is compliant with the part of the spec that requires non-postable
config writes.
Other chipsets can implement postable config space. To be compliant
with the ECN, the architecture must define a method to guarantee
the posted writes have reached the target device. I think the
ECN we've been talking about assumes that method will be implemented
in firmware somehow and NOT as a direct access method in the OS.

That means someone has to introduce a new method to access
mmconfig if they implement postable writes.
