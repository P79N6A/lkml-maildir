Modulo Len's "please remove non-existent S2 state", ACK.
We still have a general issue that most platforms implement
at most one of the sleep states the hardware allows (plus,
sometimes, hibernation).
A key differentiator of those different sleep states is usually
that they have characteristics which allow various devices to
work, or not.  Like, oh, USB controllers which need a 48 MHz
oscillator to process wakeup events ... but the deepest sleep
states must disable that oscillator.
So it's a Good Thing that this patch (and #2) expose that more
complete model of system sleep states to drivers running on x86.
