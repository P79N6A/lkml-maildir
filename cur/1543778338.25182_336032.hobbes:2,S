On a HT system, why does ACPI recognize CPU0 and CPU1, refer to them as 
such in dmesg, and then call them CPU1 and CPU2 in /proc/acpi/processor?
In uni kernels the single processor is CPU0.
This is a 2.6.10 kernel, the machine has been up since then. I have 
other 2.6 machines and other SMP and/or HT machines, but all of the HT 
machines running 2.6 are behind a hard firewall except one.
It's running the ASUS P4P800 board which is why I looked, BIOS 1086.
