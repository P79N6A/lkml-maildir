yeah: this is a build-time warning and it needs a newer/smarter gcc to 
notice that provably redundant piece of code. It's a harmless thing - 
but nevertheless Mike's fix is a nice little micro-optimization as well: 
it always bothered me a bit that at 140 priority levels we were _just_ 
past the 128 bits boundary by 12 bits. Now on 64-bit boxes it's just two 
64-bit words to cover all 100 priority levels of RT tasks.

nice - and you arent even using any OpenGL games ;)
The 0-100 rating is really useful to me so that i can see the impact of 
regressions (if any) and it's also one single number representing the 
subjective impression - that way it's easier to keep tab of things.
btw., do you still renice kmail slightly, or does it now work out of box 
with default nice 0?
