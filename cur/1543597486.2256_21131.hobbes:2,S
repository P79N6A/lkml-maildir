Actually I have something like this pretty much working.  Unfortunately 
I was working on a project full time during the 4.1.0 release.  With the 
addition of this code, the old modules will coexist with newer modules.  
Basically the newer modules will have their version numbers appended to 
their names, this way a user can build all the drm modules, and things 
will just work.  Hopefully we can get a 4.1.1 release out soon which 
will do this.  This will make the 4.0 -> 4.1 have to be a compile time 
decision, but 4.1 -> 4.1.1 and higher will just coexist with each 
other.  I'm currently working out integrating this into the kernel 
build, and I should hopefully have a patch for Linus and Alan soon.
