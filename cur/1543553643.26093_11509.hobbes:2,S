Actually, OpenBSD already has this (in the kernel !) After a kernel crash
ones, I got in the kerneldebugger. I didn't really know how to use it, but
I could play hangman. I just downloaded the source 
(pub/OpenBSD/2.7/srcsys.tar.gz) to be sure, here is a short excerpt from
sys/ddb/db_hangman.c:
---
static __inline char *
db_randomsym(lenp)
        size_t  *lenp;
{
        register char   *p, *q;
                /* choose random symtab */
        register db_symtab_t    stab = db_istab(db_random(db_nsymtabs));
                /* choose random symbol from the table */
        q = db_qualify(X_db_isym(stab,
db_random(X_db_nsyms(stab))),stab->name);
                /* don't show symtab name if there are less than 3 of 'em
*/
        if (db_nsymtabs < 3)
                while(*q++ != ':');
                /* strlen(q) && ignoring underscores and colons */
        for ((*lenp) = 0, p = q; *p; p++)
                if (ISALPHA(*p))
                        (*lenp)++;
        return q;
}
static char hangpic[]=
        "\n88888 \r\n"
          "9 7 6 \r\n"
          "97  5 \r\n"
          "9  423\r\n"
          "9   2 \r\n"
          "9  1 0\r\n"
          "9\r\n"
          "9  ";
static char substchar[]="\\/|\\/O|/-|";

and an other part:
---
void
db_hangman(addr, haddr, count, modif)
        db_expr_t addr;
        int     haddr;
        db_expr_t count;
        char    *modif;
{
        if (modif[0] == 's' && '0' <= modif[1] && modif[1] <= '9')
                skill = modif[1] - '0';
        else
                skill = 5;
        while (db_hangon());
}
