Ah!  You're correct about there being more lines.  Apparently it was
off the screen when I was doing the cut and paste.  Sorry about
that...
Here are the lines immediately preceeded the ones I posted earlier:
Jan 26 09:30:00 avo kernel: free_one_pmd: bad directory entry c7bfe000
Jan 26 09:30:00 avo kernel: kmem_free: Bad obj addr (objp=cbd54880, name=mm_stru
ct)
Jan 26 09:30:00 avo kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 
virtual address 00000000
