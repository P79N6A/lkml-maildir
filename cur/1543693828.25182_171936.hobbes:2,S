With due respect, what 2.7 really needs is a
consistent well architected _single component model.
Why it should be spawned from kernel development -
because coming up with a consistent one from higher
layers has shown to be difficult/futile/impossible. 
Many of the feature ideas listed are great but it's
rather back to architecture at this stage.
A consistent component model is needed on which people
can extend and Linux will lap the other OSs, otherwise
it will be rather difficult to
compete on the application side in the end (argument
will be: Linux is is difficult to program and has
flagrant duplication). There are many good component
models out there but the parallel re-implementation of
everything somewhat lacks cast.
So here is the feature request:
* a unified well architected core component model
which is extensible
