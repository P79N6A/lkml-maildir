Hi Ingo,
I got your scheduler rewrite going on ppc64. Here are some initial
LMbench results with sched-O1-2.4.17-B4.patch. Bear in mind the two
machines are different chips (one is Power3 and the other is RS64), so
some differences will result:
2 way (POWER3) summary:
signal handling down a bit (GOOD)
fork down a lot (very GOOD)
exec, sh down (GOOD)
context switches all down (GOOD)
communication latencies: Pipe, AF, TCP slightly up (BAD)
pipe bandwidth up (GOOD)
4 way (RS64) summary:
stat up a bit (BAD)
fork down a lot (very GOOD)
exec, sh down (GOOD)
context switches same or down (GOOD)
communication latencies: Pipe, AF, TCP slightly up (BAD)
pipe bandwidth up (GOOD)
So far things look good. Next up I'll look at how it scales on the 12
way.
Anton
