I don't know if it's the motherboard, but I've got a KT7A-RAID, and I
haven't been able to run any 2.4.x that I've tried.  I was worried,
because this board also has new RAM, but 2.2.x doesn't have any
problems at all.
I've tried:
2.4.2
2.4.3
2.4.3-ac9
2.4.3-ac11
Someone else mentioned stability problems with nVida and AGP, which
I'm also using.  It's true that I've only experienced lockups under X.
Things I haven't tried, but should (and will, once finals are over):
2.4.x, unoptimised
2.4.x, optimised, disable AGP
I'm running Debian unstable (but it's not unstable with 2.2.x :)
