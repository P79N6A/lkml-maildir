You miss my point I think.  Using ioctls *requires* a thread per-vcpu in 
userspace.  This is unnecessary since you could simply provide a 
char-device based read/write interface.  You could then multiplex events 
and poll.
If for nothing else, you have to be able to run timers in userspace and 
interrupt the kernel execution (to signal DMA completion for instance).  
Even in the UP case, this gets ugly quickly.
read/write is really just a much cleaner interface for anything that has 
blocking semantics.
