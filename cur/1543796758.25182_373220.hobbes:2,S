Why do people bring up the "derivative works" issue all the time.  Are
they so blind to the very simple "linking" issue that all kernel modules
do when they are loaded into the kernel?
That's the much simpler reason for why numerous IP lawyers of big
companies that do Linux work feel that closed source Linux kernel
modules are not legal.
