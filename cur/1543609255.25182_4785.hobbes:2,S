Why does my 40 Megabyte per second IDE drive, transfer files at best at 1-2
Megabytes per second? Can anyone prove that this must be the case? What is
the most efficient way to convince anyone who reads this that it can't be
proven because a counter example exists?
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in
response to this posting.
This is my first attempt at being part of the process. Please give me some
time to adjust.
