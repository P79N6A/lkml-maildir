Yes. It should probably either list the filesystems that use it or say
that it is limited to some filesystems. Suggested change below, or is that
still to fuzzy?
Some filesystems, like ncpfs and hopefully soon smbfs but also vfat,
really need 2 values since they may be mapping from one codepage to
another. Even if utf8 is defined as the right one for the linux side,
most fonts I have are iso8859-X ... and most people that I have gotten
emails from on this subject are mapping cp<->iso or cp<->cp.
It's currently done the same as it is in 2.2. But this would be more
complete:
CONFIG_NLS_REMOTE_DEFAULT
  - the charset/codepage from the source (disk, remote server)
CONFIG_NLS_LOCAL_DEFAULT
  - the "iocharset", for presenting the characters on the linux side.
    vfat uses CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT as "iocharset" (and so does joliet in
    2.2, looks like that was missed from the 2.4 conversion). vfat 
    requires a mount option to set the codepage it should use to access
    the disk.
    (why have a default at all if it's just for one of the values?)
Does anyone here have a reason why it is not 2 default values?
(Good time to ask, everyone is at OLS ... :)
One reason might be that nothing says that you are using the same remote
for your ncpfs mounts as you do for your vfat. But it's just a default
value ...
