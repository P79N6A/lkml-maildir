We may want to compare your original timings to what ide-timing.[ch]

As you can guess, I have mostly VIA machines around here. One SiS, too,
but that's an embedded board.

And the SIDETIM register is just a kyooot idea. :)

Dmaproc? Well that's a do-everything-possible-with-default-fallbacks
function. Quite an interesting approach, though I'd be much happier
without it.
Btw, do you know that the chipset and drives are tuned twice each boot?
First they're configured to PIO and half a second later to DMA (or PIO)
again ...
