The Cisco routers we deployed 3.5 years ago were already configured with MD5
enabled on BGP, this was on IOS 12.0 at this time. And I guess that Cisco
still has a good share amongst the BGP setups.

MD5 is not that much expensive. I even wonder if all those new routers
with VPN hardware acceleration, MD5 could not be computed in hardware
at nearly no cost.

This will not work in an eBGP multi-hop setup. However, you can often
still discard packets with a TTL < 252 or something like that, which
might imply a packet from outside the provider's area.
But the real problem is that the provider should do the anti-spoofing
himself and not accept BGP packets from the wrong NIC ! And it's relatively
easy to show them where they're bad.
