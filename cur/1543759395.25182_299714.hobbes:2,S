Different people want different things with our 2.6.x.y.
I would hope that criteria include (i) patch is obvious,
and (ii) patch fixes an embarrassing flaw.
I see no reason to include random small improvements.
(Always some of these small improvements will be a mistake,
so, in .y, when something is not really broken, don't fix it.
Maybe people were actually seeing stack overflows here?)
