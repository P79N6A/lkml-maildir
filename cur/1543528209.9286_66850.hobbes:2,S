Can't help with the command line limit, but there is A Better Way:
For the example given:
	grep hello * 
becomes:
        find . -type f -exec grep hello '{}' ';'
I assume the sort * is to merge the data:
find . -type f -print | while read v; do ; cat $v; done | sort
Where there is a shell, there is a way...
