It does work and I am using it.
It only works one time, though. Ftrace kills itself before dumping its buffer.
The trace is collected in a separate buffer. trace_hw_branch_oops() reads that buffer and adds the trace to the ftrace buffer, so ftrace can then dump it.

Sounds reasonable. I'll change it.
