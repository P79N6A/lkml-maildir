The SH kgdb work is a combination of effort by Henry Bell and Jeremy Siegel,
(ST and MV both had their own versions, Jeremy did the sync work between
the two) neither of which have touched it since mid 2.4 or so when it was
first merged into the LinuxSH tree.
Getting the SH kgdb stuff updated is on my TODO list, I'd definitely be
interested in getting this stuff in sync with Amit's work as well. Any
pointers?
