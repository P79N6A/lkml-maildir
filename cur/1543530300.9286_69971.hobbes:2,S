   pci_set_master forces a 64 latency on low latency setting devices.Some
	   boards require all cards have latency <= 32
pci_set_master should have a per-architecture implementation to
do deal with issues, such as this one.
For example, I may know that if I set the latency timer on a PCI
devices higher than X there is a bug which can be triggered to
lockup the PCI host bridge, and crap like this.
It really should not be generic.
Martin, want to cook up a patch for this?
