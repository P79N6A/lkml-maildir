Glen Turner,
I have read your posts to lkml containing your serial console flow control
patches firstly for 2.4.x and then for 2.6.x kernels.
Rationale:
 "[PATCH] 0/3 Fix serial console flow control"
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.1/1790.html
2.4 patches:
 "[PATCH] 1/3 Fix serial console flow control, serial.c"
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.1/1791.html
 "[PATCH] 2/3 Fix serial console flow control, serialP.h"
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.1/1792.html
 "[PATCH] 3/3 Fix serial console flow control, serial-console.txt"
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.1/1793.html
2.6 patch:
 "[PATCH] Fix CTS/RTS flow control in serial console"
    
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0310.2/1080.html
I have not been able to find any feedback on those patches in the lkml
archives. Also I can find no evidence that the patch made it into the
2.6.8.1 kernel. This is a shame as I found your rationale very
persuasive.
Do you maintain an up-to-date version of this patch?
Did you get any feedback for this patch, positive or negative?
Do you need people (i.e. me) to test this patch?
Thanks
Alex Owen
