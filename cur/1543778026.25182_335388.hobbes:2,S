hm.  What context switch rate is that thing doing?
Is the benchmark actually doing floating point stuff?
We do have the `used_math' optimisation in there which attempts to avoid
doing the FP save/restore if the app isn't actually using math.  But
<ancient recollections> there's code in glibc startup which always does a
bit of float, so that optimisation is always defeated.  There was some
discussion about periodically setting tasks back into !used_math state to
try to restore the optimisation for tasks which only do a little bit of FP,
but nothing actually got done.

Depends on the benefit/ugly ratio ;)
