BTW, though I repeat that this wasn't what I was suggesting, it can
be easily argued that community separation already exists. The fact
of the matter is that few mainstream developers have been "asking"
for RT. And at this point, some seem genuinely worried about its
possible integration.
So one can keep ignoring the reality of the existing clash here,
but it may just be that backing off a little and thinking about it
in less absolute integration terms would help.
