Seems that the linux-kernel list has the same result ;(

OK so we have one solid regression there.  Are the other problems also new
since 2.6.11?
Could you please retest 2.6.13-rc6 when it's out and if problems remain,
raise a bugzilla.kernel.org entry so we can keep track of the problem? 
Thanks.
(I'm trying to get all unattended and older-than-a-few-days bug reports
pushed over to bugzilla so they don't get lost).

Three months does sound optimistic.  Dominik, wouldn't a year be better?
