Same problem here...
My Router is based on Debian Etch with
Linux router 2.6.18-6-686 #1 SMP Fri Dec 12 16:48:28 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
and even if I install 2.6.26 it is the same effect.
I am using a cell-phone "Nokia 6120 classic" and my german GSM  Provider
is O2/Telefonica.  I get without any problems  550 kByte/Sec,  but  then
from one second to another 2-5 kByte/Sec.
I have to use
1)  poff o2
2)  wait for termination
3)  disconnect the Nokia
4)  nodprobe -r cdc_acm
5)  reconenct the Nokia
6)  pon o2
and now it work again...  But sometimes, my Nokia (Symbian S60) crashs.
Normaly I can use "cdc_ether" plus "rndis_host" but any kernel modules I
have tried are crashing.  (Bugreport alredy to the Debian BTS)
Since the "cdc_ether" and the "rndis_host" is loaded automaticaly  if  I
connect my Nokia I had to remove the two modules plus usbnet physicaly.
