It should actually be fast enough. I suspect something else, maybe some
slow devices. What's /proc/interrupts look like?

exit_notify() isn't a huge surprise unless you're not doing things with
lots of processes. Actually, it probably is a surprise, since it should
only hurt when you're doing forkbombs and/or threadbombs.
The kmap_atomic() stuff is too consistent. Maybe you're taking an
interrupt during the copy operation.
fget() is mind-bogglingly O(1) and very short. Only plausible guess is
we're seeing interrupts taken there because it's so frequently called.

Not surprised either. There's probably enough time spent with interrupts
off the local_irq_save() hurt, and it didn't make your schedule() things
go away, so my wild guesswork thus far is it made things worse with no
tangible benefit, so best to drop that local_irq_save() change.
