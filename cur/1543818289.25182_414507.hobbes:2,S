/ UNIX
 Symbol: UNIX [=y]
 Prompt: Unix domain sockets
   Defined at net/unix/Kconfig:5
   Depends on: NET
   Location:
     -> Networking
       -> Networking support (NET [=y])
         -> Networking options
 Symbol: UNIXWARE_DISKSLICES ...
  ...
What would be more useful:
 UNIX
   Unix domain sockets
   Networking > Networking Support > Networking options
 UNIXWARE_DISKSLICES
   Unixware slices support
   File systems > Advanced ...
I.e. strip the Defined and Depends lines and crunch the Location lines inasfar
as that the full width of the window is used (break at col 70).
 DEEP_FS
   Just a symbol
   File systems > Advanced filesystems > Very advanced filesystems >\n
   Extremely advanced filesystems > Deep filesystem

At the moment, entering e.g. UNIX in both the / and \ menus return the very 
same output. Bug?
The \ should include everything what the original / had, plus the symbol
description ("Say Y here if ....").
