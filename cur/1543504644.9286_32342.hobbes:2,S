We should rather make it dynamic - some drivers already do that.
Of course, that means disposing the table from Space.c.
OTOH most drivers use separate (kmalloced) stats memory - I think the best
we can do to prevent wasting &fragmenting RAM is to allocate it in one chunk:
struct netdevice {
	struct device netdev;		/* Must be first item */
	struct net_device_stats stats;
	char name[IFNAMSIZ];
};
register_network_device_with_stats_and_possibly_other_things (char *name):
{
  struct netdevice *dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct netdevice), GFP_KERNEL);
  if (dev==NULL)
	return NULL;
  memset(dev, 0, sizeof(struct netdevice));
  dev->netdev.name=dev->name;
  if (dev_alloc_name(&hdlc->netdev, name))
	{
	kfree(dev);
	return NULL;
	}
  
  if (register_netdevice(&dev->netdev)!=0)
    {
    kfree(dev);
    return NULL;
    }
  return dev;
}  
Or should we just merge all fields (device, stats, name) into one struct?
