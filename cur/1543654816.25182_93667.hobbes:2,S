It is trivial to make (2) available as a module but it has been debated
that having configuration information available as module does not make
the job of keeping a reliable source of kernel configuration any easier
than just keeping a copy of config file in, say, /lib/modules directory.
If you can ensure you always have the right module file available for
the running kernel, you can also ensure you always have the right config
file available for the kernel.
