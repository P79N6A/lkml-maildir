Thanks, I have overlooked this third bug. An incremental patch on top of 
my previous kernel_lock_bug.diff is attached. (I have also uploaded the 
patches to <
http://acl.bestbits.at/pre/v2.5/>
 in the meantime).

The important point for me now is to get the iops xattr-flags and 
xattr-flags-policy patches into 2.5 so that the API won't change during 
2.6. The xattr-trusted patch only affects file systems locally, so it's 
far less critical.
The kernel side of trusted EAs is completely implemented with the 
patches I sent. In the future there will very likely be modules 
actually making use of the XATTR_KERNEL_CONTEXT flag, but Trusted EAs 
are quite useful from user space alone.
Cheers,
Andreas.
