You are wrong. I fixed the _cause_. My fix was a compile time thing so to
make it working everywhere you should add a kernel option to set the new
value or the old value. We all want it autotuning of course so it was a 
missing feature but the fix was correct.
To fix the _same_ cause in a dynamic way I should have changed my focus on
a differen work, in a differen tree-branch and doing a controversial patch
and so I choosed the compile time way since I only wanted to fix the
problem on the class of machine I use (>=32mbyte of ram).
I am very happy to get the dynamic fix too of course and that's why I
CC'ed to Chuck as I was almost sure he worked on something like that.
Now it cames out that the icache is static for everybody out there (unless
Chuck did that), so I can do the icache dynamic thing of course, but in
the meantime I'll __need__ to use the compile time fix to have a chance to
test my code.

Without enlarging the hash the find_inode would be at the first hit with
an huge value. Right now instead everything goes fine very fast and when
the system will need memory the icache/dcache are shrunk automagically.
BTW, but I have not yet asked myself what the weird
"spurious_interrupt_bug" at the top of the profiling is 8).
