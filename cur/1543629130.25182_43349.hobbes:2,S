Well, our ia64 platform is at least, but I think there are others.

AFAIK, some MIPS platforms (both NUMA and non-NUMA) have memory
layouts like this too.  I've never done hardware design before, so I'm
not sure if there's a good reason for such layouts.  Ralf or Daniel
might be able to shed some more light on that...
