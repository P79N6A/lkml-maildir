I actually suggest you literally delay your push-out.
I don't generally delay things by a lot, but I tend to try to at least do 
a compile in between pushing out - and even if I've pulled something in 
between the thing that broke, I'll just "git reset --hard" to a working 
state if something broke, and just re-pull instead of even trying to 
rebase or anything like that.
(IOW, I often find it much easier to just start over and re-do than 
actually doing a rebase).
I don't do it all the time, by any means, but there's really no huge 
reason to push out all the time. And that's doubly true for subsystem 
maintainers. Quite often, the right thing to do is to only push out when 
you are ready to do the "please pull" message.

It would also be really cool if Claudia Schiffer had decided that hiding 
under my desk is a good idea. 
IOW, you really haven't though that through. That is how TLA and darcs 
worked, and it's a total disaster.
Trust me, you don't know how good you have it.
