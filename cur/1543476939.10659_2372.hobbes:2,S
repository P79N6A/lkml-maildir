I thoroughly disagree that either the STL (esp. the algorithms part)
or exceptions inevitably leads to unreadable code.
Exceptions may be a really useful way to (e.g.) return -ENOENT from
three or four levels deep in filesystem code -- without testing for
error conditions at each call level.  But you have to go whole-hog;
a hybrid part-exception- part-error-return system would simply add
complexity.
And STL iterators and algorithms *could* be useful for some kernel
structures.  You'd have to experiment to know for sure.

Ditto.  The C++ Perl implementation I mentioned in a previous message
undoes the threading experiment contained in Perl 5.005.
