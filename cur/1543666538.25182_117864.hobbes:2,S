Personally, I prefer:
/usr/local/-architecture-/include/sys-include/asm-architecture
/usr/local/-architecture-/include/sys-include/linux
If you install a lot of cross compilers, you might find that that
layout is the most logical.

Not sure if RedHat does this or not, but something that I would always
recommend is avoided, is assuming that /usr/src/linux is a symbolic
link to the current kernel source code.
