The problems are often error paths.
I might be running in some unusual error paths in CIFS, and the same 
might be true for you in the SMB and NFS cases.
The SMB file system in the kernel is unfrtunately unmaintained, but NFS 
is well maintained. Have you sent a bug report for your NFS problems 
similar to my bug report for my CIFS problems?
