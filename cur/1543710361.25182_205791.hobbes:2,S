Just to throw a little more gas on this particular fire (or maybe
some water, depending on your point of view), when I worked for a while
at the Evil Empire, the "const == variable" comparison was mandatory in
the group I worked in. Odd to look at initially, I'll admit, but it 
still caught
several potential bugs. One other thing that was mandatory was to
set to NULL any pointer to memory area that was freed immediately after
freeing it. Again, a good idea, although not a coding style issue.
