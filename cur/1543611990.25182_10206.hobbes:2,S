    Yes, sorry, just a mental shortcircuit ;))

    Yes, I know and I think that is a good thing to have a good
configuration language, and it means having a good specification and
a good parser. Just I don't think that 6Mb-Python is a good way to
write a good parser. Well, I'm sure that I cannot do better (right
now), so I don't want to flame anyone with this, just want to show my
opinion (shared by many, although) and show the negative points of
having Python as a dependence.
>The spec for CML2 is out there, and there's even a CML2-in-C project.
    How advanced? Where is the spec, please?
>that project out and then convince Linus to include it.
    Hard job... Convincing Linus, I mean ;)))

    Well, IMHO Python is good only in being big and doing things
slow, but... why the parser cannot be built over flex/bison?. That
way it can be 'pregenerated' and people won't need additional tools
to build the kernel.
