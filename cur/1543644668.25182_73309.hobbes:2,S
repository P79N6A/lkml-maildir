I am experiencing kernel errors when accessing disks attached to the
PDC20276. Executing command 'badblocks -svw /dev/hde' starts fine:
sv-sap001:/home/andree# badblocks -svw /dev/hde
Checking for bad blocks in read-write mode
From block 0 to 39082680
Writing pattern 0xaaaaaaaa:   1266090/ 39082680
After a while I start getting messages like the stuff below on the
console (this manually copied from the console).
This happens on both drives and on both channels. Cables were replaced,
so were the harddisks. I returned the machine to my dealer who tested
things under WinXP and says that everything works fine. I have tried
this with 2.4.19 and pretty much all 2.4.20preX and 2.4.20preX-acY
version over the past three weeks without success. When I switch off DMA
('hdparm -d0 /dev/hde') things are of course terribly slow but they work
fine.
I am trying hdaprm -d1 -X15 at the moment. It has been running for 40
hours now and gotten as far as 27047040/39082680. So far it looks like I
only get 'eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!' but no IDE errors.
Sometimes I am getting a kernel Aiiii followed by a kernel panic saying
something like 'Trying to kill interrupt handler'. I just haven't been
able to reproduce it for this mail. :-(
I am happy to do other testing if  someone tells me what to do. Just
bear in mind that though being an experienced Linux administrator I am
nothing close to a kernel developer. ;-)
Best regards
Andree
