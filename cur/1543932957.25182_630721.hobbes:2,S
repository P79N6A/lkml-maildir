Hi Jan,
I like and support your idea!

Yes, but why export variables? Wouldn't it be better to export 
an API? 
That simplifies the callers (they all pass "current" as task 
and "task_notifier_list" as arguments).
It also prevents exposing internal variables (notifier lists 
ARE internal variables) to modules.
What do you think?
