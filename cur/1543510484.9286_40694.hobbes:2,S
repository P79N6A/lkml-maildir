Hello,
This msg is to thank especially the ones who answered to my request
(namely Adam Sulmicki, Steve Dodd, Mark Hahn and Simon Richter), but
not only them. I thank all of you who are here making this list the best
resource of kernel info there is, and more than that, a Linux _community_.
I needed help, and I got it.
Sometimes (I said _sometimes_) OFFTOPIC msgs deserve some attention. And
I'm not saying that because I was the one on need for help, but because it
was a very, _very_ important issue to me (and somehow kernel-related).
Those answers I received are what differentiate a mailing list from a
community, IMHO.
Thanks again, Linux Kernel COMMUNITY !!!
Regards,
Ivan
