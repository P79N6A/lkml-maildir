Yes, but the current code uses 1193180.  Wonder why that is...

If we are following the standard and trying to set up a timer, the 1 second time 
MUST be >= 1 second.  Thus the values for 300 and above in this table don't fly. 
  If we are trying to keep system time, well we do just fine at that by using 
the actual value of the jiffie (NOT 1/HZ) when we update time (one of the 
reasons for going to nanoseconds in xtime).  The observable thing the user sees 
is best seen by setting up an itimer to repeat every second.  Then you will see 
the drift AND it will be against the system clock which itself is quite accurate 
(the 50-100ppm you mention), even without ntp.  And the error really is in the 
range of 848ppm for HZ=1000 BECAUSE we need to follow the standard.  You can 
easily see this with the current 2.6 kernel.  We even have a bug report on it:
