Note that this system does not allow an admin to have some power that
just works with every unmarked executable. It isn't even a config option.
Such a feature would allow a more secure but still UNIX-like behavior.

Just how configurable? You would need to have:
1. some bits that are 0
2. some bits that are 1
3. some bits that are 1 for root and 0 for others
Ugh. You still don't kill the special treatment for root. This won't do.

Please explain how to do this:
1. there exists a program called a.out that everyone can run
2. there are two admins, avatar and super
3. there a capability called CAP_X
4. avatar can run everything with CAP_X
5. super only gets CAP_X when running a.out
Now add:
6. there is a restricted user that must _never_ get CAP_X
   (the normal users get CAP_X via fP, but this user can't do that)
Add this too:
7. there is a buggy executable called b.out that must never get CAP_X
   (avatar wants to run this executable)

This is very bad. When 'chown bin myfile' always failed in the past,
every single privileged operation failed. With the new system, you
can have partial failures. This can really make a mess with programs
that expect to perform multiple operations.
