"Other commands" don't have to transfer up to 256 sectors before interrupting.

Yeah, but that's not what our software timeout is for.
The timeout is for the next interrupt, which will only 
be given (for DMA) once the drive completes *all* transfers.

I don't think so, even for modern drives.
Figure 8-10 seconds max for spin-up,
plus 6-9 seconds to do a sector re-assignment
or retries on a bad block (a measured *real-life* value).
That adds up to 14-19 seconds, so 20 seconds is probably good.
Still, this does need to be adjustable for faster (CF) devices,
and slower (optical/tape) devices, rather than just a single
set of fixed timeout values.
