	Hello Alexey , Having done a little playing around with the
	'ip' tool .  I have a suggestion for a new feature .  If it
	doesn't already exist .
	For:   ip route
	flush -	Flushes all routes , except the interface defined routes .
		will remove all routes to interfaces that have not been
		installed by ifconfig .
	Reasoning :
	f.e.:	given :
	ifconfig eth0   10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
	ifconfig eth1   10.0.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
	Now we add thru a route daemon gated/in.route/... a whole
	series of routes .  At present I have no easy way to get back 
	to a clean state without 'reboot' .  Is there some feature
	already in place within 'ip' or 'route' that will allow me to
	reasonably easily clean my route stack back to just the
	interface routes ?  Also can 'ip' be used under 2.0.x series ?
 				Tia, JimL
