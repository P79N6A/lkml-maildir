Subject: PATCH: BeOS FS support for 2.2.16
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I took some time to update the code I found at
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA008030/bfs/.
This patche applies to a clean 2.2.16 kernel tree and adds support for
bos (name changed
to prevent conflict with bfs in 2.4).  I hope to mod it for use in 2.4
as time permits.
It provides for read-only, however it will allow you to mount read
write.  Not certain that it
won't do something nasty, so mount with -o ro.
Basically, I fixed one typo and updated the nls stuff for long filename
support.
TTYS
