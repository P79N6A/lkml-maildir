This logic is just plain totally completely rediculous.  So each
hard disk produced would cost $0.06 *CENTS* more if they included
a jumper?  OH NO!  That would cost them 45 BILLION dollars a year
to include? 
Know what I say about that?  *bullshit*  - not to you, but to the
idea that it costs money.
Push the $0.06 cents per drive on to the consumer.  Shit, crank
it up to $1.00.  I'll pay an extra dollar on my $200 hard disk to
get the jumper.  *ANYONE* would gladly pay the 6 cents, that is
for sure.  So, instead of spending 45 billion dollars on jumpers,
they could easily double that, and MAKE 45billion dollars.  Bring
that up to a dollar, and they could retire early.
