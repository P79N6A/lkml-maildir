Thanks.  For now just disable usbfs2, or make it a module and don't load
it.  It is _very_ raw and as you see, doesn't work properly.  And, in
working on it some more, usbfs2 is not even going to be a file system,
but instead just rely on device nodes, like usbfs does today.  That will
allow us to proper set ACLs and not force distros to have to mount
yet-another-filesytem.
thanks,
greg k-h
