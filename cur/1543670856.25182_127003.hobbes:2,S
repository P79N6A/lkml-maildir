I've been using the matroxfb drivers at
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/
for the last 3 months with good luck. (G400, single monitor, 
using text console and X).
Linux rushmore 2.5.68-mm1 #1 Sun Apr 20 19:45:04 EDT 2003 i686 unknown
Besides the other 2.5.x changes for video/console
documented by davej at 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt
matroxfb wants "matroxfb" in the boot string, rather than "matrox".
My current append directive for lilo includes:
video=matroxfb:vesa:depth:32,fh:115,fv:92,xres:1920,yres:1440,left:392,right:124
But don't use that string, as most monitors cannot handle it.  It happens to be
for a ViewSonic PF815.  (other than "fb" in "matroxfb", the same string 
is what I was using with 2.4.x).
Perhaps it's easier for Petr to maintain matroxfb outside Linus' tree
at the moment.  I'm glad he keeps putting his patches up.
