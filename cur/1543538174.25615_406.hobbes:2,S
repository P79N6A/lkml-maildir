With the stock kernel and the non-user pointer rule, the only way to
cause this is to put a printk in either printk itself, or the console
print function.  In this case, no amount of changes to the locking will
fix this.  In fact, trying to fix it makes it far worse.

With what I've said above, the kernel developer would have to be very
dumb to put a printk in those places.  It's almost on the level of doing:
void a(void)
{
	b();
}
void b(void)
{
	a();
}

The rules:
1. Don't pass user addresses to printk
2. Don't call printk from the low-level console print routes
If this rules are followed, you will not get burned.
