Maybe, but it seems like a bad idea to me.  It's longer, it's less
obvious what's happening, and it precludes the sorts of optimization
that we do on ppc64 where a cpu that is waiting for a lock can tell
give its time slice to the cpu that is holding the lock (on systems
where the hypervisor time-slices multiple virtual cpus on one physical
cpu).
What's wrong with just doing spin_lock/spin_unlock?
Paul.
