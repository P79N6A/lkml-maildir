AFAIK, per Posix df(1) always reports sizes in 1k blocks.  I have
fileutils 4.0 (RH6.0) and df output looks fine for both 1k and 4k
filesystems on my machine:
[root@abbadon ncftp]# df
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1                49552     45018      1975  96% /
/dev/sda6              1287988    683343    538086  56% /home
/dev/sda5              1684125    842829    754257  53% /usr
/dev/sda7               578873    155799    393174  28% /usr/local
/dev/sda3               396549     22355    353714   6% /var
/dev/hda1              7780252   6568796    809836  89% /usr/local/workspace
/dev/hda2              8558308   3136540   4979984  39% /usr/local/workspace2
The last two are 4k, the rest 1k.
