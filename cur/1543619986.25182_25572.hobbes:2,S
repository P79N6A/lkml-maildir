That is not guaranteed to be correct though.  Why not allow the
builder of the kernel to choose an option to keep it in the
kernel unswappable memory, or to place it in the lib/modules
directory?  That should allow the builder to choose tho option that
is best for them, with no adverse impacts on those who choose
a different option...
