In XFS, one of the shrinkers cwthat gets registered calls causes all
the xfsbufd's in the system to run and write back delayed write
metadata - this can't be freed up until it is clean, and this is the
only hook we have that can be used to trigger writeback on memory
pressure. We need this because we can potentially have hundreds of
megabytes of dirty metadata per XFS filesystem.
IOW, the way the VM expects the shrinkers to work can be far, far
away from what subsystems need the shrinker callbacks for....
Cheers,
Dave.
