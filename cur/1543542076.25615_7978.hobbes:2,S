Hi.
In the test7-pre7 driver move-around drivers/char/stallion.c (a serial
driver) was moved to drivers/media/video. This confuses the makefile
in drivers/char somewhat -> link error. I guess that stallion.c needs
to be moved back into drivers/char. Otherwise the config.in and
makefile in drivers/char and drivers/media/video needs attention.
I would post a patch but it is ~290K so I decided not to :) The
mv is trivial. Or the patch can de downloaded from 
www.jaquet.dk/kernel/patches/stallion.c.patch.gz
