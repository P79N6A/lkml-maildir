Reverting
sched-x86-sched_clock-to-use-tsc-on-config_hpet-or-config_numa-systems.patch
fixed both the printk timestamps and the slow suspend. And it also fixed
a **major** interactivity problem (running kernel compiles made X almost
unusably slow) which I discovered since sending the previous e-mail. So,
something about this patch is seriously evil.
