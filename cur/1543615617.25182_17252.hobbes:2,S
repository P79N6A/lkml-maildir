I don't think the implication was that sizeof(foo) is better style because
more people like it.  The implication is that consistency is, in general,
good programming style and it's easier to arrive at consistency by adhering
to the majority style than by adhering to the minority style.
Of course, there are other variables that may in any particular case have
more weight than the consistency or minimal effort considerations.
And I don't see what any of this has to do with whether an option should be
removed from Lindent.  Lindent should be a tool, which means it helps a
user do whatever he wants to do.  Whether he should want to do "sizeof
(foo)" is a separate issue.
