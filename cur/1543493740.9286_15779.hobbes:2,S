  SMP is supported on EV6, at least it seems to run with 2 CPUs on the dual 
  boxes I have access to. I think what you're looking at is interupt
  handling (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong).
the above source file seems to infer that interrupts are always
delivered to cpu#0. perhaps this is just for initialisation purposes,
i don't know.
