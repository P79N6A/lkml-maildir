Oops, I hadn't noticed that :)
Perhaps one of the cpu specific options in the config? 
Sadly I can't remember what options there are, and the last 2.6 kernel
compile I did was with 2.6.3 or 4 so there may be new options, but I
can't think of anything that could conceivably cause weirdness in the
clock speed detection...
