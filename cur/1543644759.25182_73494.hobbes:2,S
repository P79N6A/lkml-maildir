Subject: tons of "Warning - running *really* short on DMA buffers" messages - 2.4.19, aic7xxx

Is there anything that can be done about these? Running 2.4.19 on a
piii-800, 512MB, scsi hardware raid.
Seeing tons of these messages (flooding syslogs) whenever I do much I/O
to the drives.
Is there any vm tuning that can be done?
