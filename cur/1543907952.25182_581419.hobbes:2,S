So only use <h1> to <h6>, <p>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <ul>, <ol> and <li>.
Perhaps maybe <p class="block"> with .block{text-align:justify;}
because that looks nice in general.

Accessibility, well, just run w3m instead of less, and you've got it.
Or `w3m -dump xxx.html | less` if you really need it paged.
Translation, no I do not think that is a big issue. But people should
perhaps be kept on the utf-8 toe since html can specify the encoding.

- two lines between block elements, e.g.
  <h1></h1>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ol></ol>\n\n..
- tabs used, <ol>\t<li>long long text\n\t\twrapped line</li>\n</ol>
There is not much to it I think. Use of WYSIWYG editors should be prohibited,
since some reformat the code in terms of line length, "aol-ize" it
(<ol> to <OL>) or replace tags by some synonym.
