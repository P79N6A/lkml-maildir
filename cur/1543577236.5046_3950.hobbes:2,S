You probably had a inode namespace collision. unfsd encodes the dev_t in the 
upper in ext2 unused bits of the inode to be able to export multiple file systems in 
a single export (knfsd dropped that broken feature) That sometimes fails, yielding
duplicate inode numbers. When the collision happens for objects with different
types (e.g. directory and file) then the client detects it immediately when 
the other object is still in its inode cache and marks the inode bad, giving
these EIOs. Newer unfsd has various tuning options to avoid these collisions,
but it does not always work. It depends on the actual device numbers and inode
used so could suddenly appear on a system update.

It is impractical in knfsd for NFS for most other network file systems (especially
those that have "artificial" inode numbers like smbfs). knfsd over FAT or amiga ffs
is probably a problem too. 
Your problem case really sounds like you just need a proxy.
