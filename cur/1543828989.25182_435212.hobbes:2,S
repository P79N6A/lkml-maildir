Hello There,
   I am trying to load Montavista linux to intel
ixp425. The board comes with redboot on it.
The redboot itself shows the following error before
its prompt comes up.
[error] ixEthMiiPhyScan : unexpected Mii PHY ID
03026071
Anyway, I am able to load zImage and ramdisk to
0x01600000 and 0x00800000 respectively. But when I
give "go 0x01600000", kernel starts
"Uncompressing....". But, in the middle one message
comes like "Unable to handle kernel paging request at 
virtual address 40afb000 mm = c01e1380 pgd =
c0004000".
Has anyone encountered the same problem?
Please help me.
Thanks 
Dennis
