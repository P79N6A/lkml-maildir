Yep.  That's the idea! :)

Well, that's about how far the idea was supposed to go. ;)  I think named 
hierarchical sched_domains would offer the same functionality (at least for CPU 
partitioning) as CPUSETs.  I'm not sure who didn't think it was fancy enough, 
but if you or anyone else can describe CPUSETs configurations that couldn't be 
represented by sched_domains trees, I'd be very curious to hear about them.
