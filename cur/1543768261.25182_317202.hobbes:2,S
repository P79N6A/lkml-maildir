The application doesn't have to get it "right" however you define that, 
but unless you expect to extend the API to add a 
signal(STARTMORETHREADS) it makes sense for the application to have some 
idea what the hardware config is, because the kernel doesn't know what 
the application is going to do (future) vs. what it already did (past).
Running a number of threads somewhat close to the number of CPUs, or 
sockets, or something else the application can know is far better than 
starting 64 threads in case this is a big NUMA machine, or running 
single thread while seven of eight CPUs do nothing.
By looking at Ncpu and ldavg a smart application can avoid being really 
wrong, which gives the kernel a better chance of improving throughput.

If the application can choose a sane number of threads, that makes the 
problem of memory management and CPU scheduling easier. Just because the 
application can't do a perfect job doesn't mean that it should do 
without information needed to do something reasonable.
Perfect is the enemy of better.
