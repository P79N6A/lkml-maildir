Oprofile cannot be improved to provide stopwatch timing.
It is impossible because oprofile is sampling, not direct measurement.
Perfmon2, or anything which requires a system call to read a meter
[counter] of nanoseconds [per-thread virtualized cycle counter]
often adds unreasonably high overhead: hundreds of cycles or more,
instead of tens or less.  CPU manufacturers are making life
difficult for users of perfctr, by muddying the meaning of
their user-readable cycle counters (see x86 RDTSC) or by omitting
user-readable cycle counters entirely (whether in the name of lower cost,
reducing "side channel" system information leaks, or otherwise.)
