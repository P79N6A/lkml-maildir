It probably happened when users where simultaneously logging in (many 
kdeinit processes created at that time).

Yeah, ok.
In the meantime couple of these found their way to logs during the night:
3ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at search_by_key+0xe3/0xf70 and ending at do_IRQ+0xec/0x130
And this still seems to be very long and real:
50ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at snd_pcm_action_lock_irq+0x1b/0x1d0 [snd_pcm] and ending at 
snd_pcm_action_lock_irq+0x65/0x1d0 [snd_pcm]
Trace has this:
[<f9239b09>] snd_pcm_playback_ioctl1+0x49/0x2f0 [snd_pcm]
So maybe this too is ioctl related (non-educated guess)?
