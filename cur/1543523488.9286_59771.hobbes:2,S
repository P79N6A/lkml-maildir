Sorry to followup my own post, but just in time I got the following in
my mail this morning:
/etc/cron.daily/standard:
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/Printstr.h: Input/output error
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/Printstr.h: Input/output error
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/Printstr.h: Input/output error
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/XKBfile.h: Input/output error
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/XKBfile.h: Input/output error
find: /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/XKBfile.h: Input/output error
I haven't fixed it yet, so if there's any more info I can get from the
system before I fix it, please let me know.
