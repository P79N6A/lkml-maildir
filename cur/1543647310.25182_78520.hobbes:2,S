# [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug bug fix
# 
# Found the bug.  The following patch fixes the hot plug
# driver so that it has a fallback when there are no unused
# IRQs on a system.  At some point intialization got re-
# ordered and this was broken.
# 
# I found another bug that was preventing the existing scheme from
# working.  It looks like the function "pcibios_set_irq_routing" is
# returning 1 for success, but the hot plug driver was interpreting it as
# failure.
