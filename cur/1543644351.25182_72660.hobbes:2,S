so why not keep the core parts as separate patches as well? If it does
nothing then i dont see why it should get into the kernel proper.

(i think you have not read what i have written. I use tracing pretty
frequently, and no, i dont need tracing in the kernel, during development
i can apply patches to kernel trees just fine.)
