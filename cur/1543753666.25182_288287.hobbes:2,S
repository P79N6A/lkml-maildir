over on #ardour last week, we saw appalling performance from
reiserfs. a 120GB filesystem with 11GB of space failed to be able to
deliver enough read/write speed to keep up with a 16 track
session. When the filesystem was cleared to provide 36GB of space,
things improved. The actual recording takes place using writes of
256kB, and no more than a few hundred MB was being written during the
failed tests.
everything i read about reiser suggests it is unsuitable for audio
work: it is optimized around the common case of filesystems with many
small files. the filesystems where we record audio is typically filled
with a relatively small number of very, very large files.
