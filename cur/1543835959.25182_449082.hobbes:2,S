I'm curious if there's a reason we're still carrying "lib/errno.c". 
The string "errno" is used pretty heavily but from a grep glance it seems 
any users define it locally (and indeed, the concurrency issues with a global 
'errno' symbol mean it would be worthless except during boot, or maybe 
under BKL).
Thanks,
Chase
