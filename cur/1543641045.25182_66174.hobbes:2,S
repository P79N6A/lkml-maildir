I posted a similar message last week. No response, but that was on
Gcc3.2, but when I tried out on gcc2.95.3, it failed too.
Symptons:
	create 28MB ramdisk, fill up to 18MB, system boots ok.
	create 28MB ramdisk, fill up to 24MB, system can't boot, fail at
	RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0 ... then stuck!
What's the next step to debug this?
Thanks,
Jeff
