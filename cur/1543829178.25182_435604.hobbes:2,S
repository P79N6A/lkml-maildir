The fact that is used to work in some vendor kernel is irrelevant.  And
2.4 hardly indicates anyway.

You see how amazingly popular the board was.  On April 2 just after
2.6.16 was out I announced my intension to remove the board in
  
http://www.linux-mips.org/cgi-bin/mesg.cgi?a=linux-mips&i=20060402194822.GA26358
%40linux-mips.org
Nobody raised hand to take care of the maintenance of any of these boards,
thus 
http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/ITE-8172G
 also marks the board as
to be deleted.

There is more that just that wrong with the board support.  And if the
fact that it is was broken does not even result bug reports this is
another indicator the board a board should go.
The usual reminder: patches to fix the issues will be accepted.
