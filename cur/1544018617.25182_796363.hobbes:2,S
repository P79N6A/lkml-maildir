SLUB can directly free an object to any slab page. "Queuing" on free via
the per cpu slab is only possible if the object came from that per cpu
slab. This is typically only the case for objects that were recently
allocated.
There is no switching of queues because they do not exist in that form in
SLUB. We always determine the page address and put the object into the
freelist of that page. Also results in nice parallelism since the lock is
not even cpu specific.

Yes you can loose track of caching hot objects. That is one of the
concerns with the SLUB approach. On the other hand: Caching architectures
get more and more complex these days (especially in a NUMA system). The
SLAB approach is essentially trying to guess which objects are cache hot
and queue them. Sometimes the queueing is advantageous (may be a reason
that SLAB is better than SLUB in some cases). In other cases SLAB keeps
objects on queues but the object have become sale (context switch, slab
unused for awhile). Then its no advantage anymore.

F.e. On free you need to determine the node to find the right queue in
SLAB. SLUB does not need to do that. It simply determines the page address
and does not care about the node when freeing the object. It is irrelevant
on which node the object sits.
Also on alloc: The per cpu slab can be from a foreign node. NUMA locality
does only matter if the caller wants memory from a particular node. So
cpus that have no local memory can still use the per cpu slabs to have
fast allocations etc etc.

But they require more metadata handling because they need to manage lists
of order-0 pages. metadata handling is reduced by orders of magnitude in
SLUB.
