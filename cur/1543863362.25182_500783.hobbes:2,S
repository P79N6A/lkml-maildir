This means page cache = unmapped file backed page right? Otherwise this 
would not work. I always thought that the page cache were all file backed 
pages both mapped and unmapped.
With the proposed schemd you would have to move pages between lists if 
they are mapped and unmapped by a process. Terminating a process could 
lead to lots of pages moving to the unnmapped list.
