That's what I suspected based on reports from several JACK users (JACK
used to use rdtsc directly, it now uses clock_gettime).
Hmm, it looks like the kernel uses the TSC left and right, even if
clock=pmtmr is used.  There's even an rdtscll in pmtimer_mark_offset().
Wow, what a mess.  Thanks, AMD...
