Moreover, Andrew should probably just drop this driver from -mm for now.

I'm working on "e1000e" right now...

yes, these are some of the kinks I still need to address. Allthough minor, it's 
going to take me some time to get it to the first step before I want to submit 
it (patience :))

I'll submit it with only ich9 id's at first, but it will be able to drive (sysfs 
bind) to some other devices too. This allows me to keep an eye out on the future 
structure that I want to give it without removing too much code that I might 
then later have to add back.
