I'm fine with a delay, but the __delay(1) is simply not "correct". It 
doesn't do anything.
"udelay()" waits for a certain time. Use that.

No it does not.
You may think it does, but it does nothing of the sort.
Use "udelay()" or somethign that actually takes a *time*.
Just __delay() is nothing but a loop, and calling it with an argument of 1 
is stupid and buggy. 
The only *possibly* valid use of "__delay()" implies using a counter that 
is based on the "loops_per_sec" thing, which depends on what the delay  
function actually is.
For example, the delay function may well turn out to be this:
        __asm__ __volatile__(
                "\tjmp 1f\n"
                ".align 16\n"
                "1:\tjmp 2f\n"
                ".align 16\n"
                "2:\tdecl %0\n\tjns 2b"
                :"=&a" (d0)
                :"0" (loops));
Notice? "Your code, it does nothing!"
When I said that the code was buggy, I meant it.
It has nothing to do with spinlocks. And "__delay(1)" is *always* a bug.
You migth want to replace it with
	smp_rmb();
	udelay(1);
instead, at which point it *does* something: it has that read barrier 
(which is not actually needed on x86, but whatever), and it has a delay 
that is *meaningful*.
A plain "__delay(1)" is neither.
So let me repeat my statement: "What a piece of crap".
