Apply the kernel debugger patch and recompile, making sure you select
the NMI oopser option if you are running uniprocessor.  Instead of a
freeze you should get an NMI oops after 5 seconds and drop into kdb,
you need a text console or a serial console to talk to kdb.  Start with
a backtrace command (bt) to see where the problem is, it is probably
spinning on a lock.
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/ix86/kdb-v1.5-2.4.0-test9-pre9.gz
fits kernels >= 2.4.0-test9-pre9 && < 2.4.0-test10-pre4, including
2.4.0-test9.
