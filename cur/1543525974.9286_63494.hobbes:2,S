This is the PCI interrupt that gets allocated for the controller itself.
That interrupt also gets used for all true cardbus cards.
The allocation logic is probably slightly off, though. The code tries to
avoid allocating an interrupt that is not used for anything else, but the
code in question is new and might have problems. This particular irq
selection is handled by the generic PCI interrupt code, see
pcibios_lookup_irq() in arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c..

A 16-bit PCMCIA card gets an ISA interrupt, and here the logic is
completely different - it's not the same irq pin as the PCI interrupt, and
we just search for a completely unused irq that matches the irq list that
we know the controller can generate.

The only real reason is that pci_socket.c can handle any kind of PCI
PCCARD controller, while yenta.c just implements one specific class of
controllers (namely the true cardbus ones). Right now any non-cardbus
controller (whether it is PCI or ISA) just falls back on the i82365 code.
In the future, there might be non-cardbus PCI PCCARD controllers. Although
the way things are looking, that kind of hardware is getting pretty
scarce..
