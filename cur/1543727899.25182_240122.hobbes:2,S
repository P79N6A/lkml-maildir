I believe your complaint was for 2.4, since it doesn't support SG_IO for
atapi devices. For 2.6 you are just wasting cycles using ide-scsi on
ATAPI burners.

If they all use the interface. Like with all interfaces, it takes time
before it's being used kernel-wide.

I have lots of discussions on linux-kernel, and not all of them (very
few, in fact) end up in flames. You seem to end up in flames with
basically everyone. At least on linux-kernel, I believe my track record
is far better than yours. Your mails are often infuriating.
Since you do not listen to anything I say anyways and keep reiterating
the same comments again and again like a duracell bunny, it's hard to
have a technical discussion with you.
End of discussion from me. Before you claim I'm going away because I
have no arguments (that's rich, coming from you), I'm closing this
thread from my end since you bring nothing to the table except flame
bait and repeated empty arguments.
