Of course these sorts of applications don't know what they'll be doing in
the future.  Often the location of the next update is driven by something
which came across the network.

There's no need to do that.   Look:
msync(MS_ASYNC): propagate pte dirty flags into pagecache
LINUX_FADV_ASYNC_WRITE: start writeback on all pages in region which are
dirty and which aren't presently under writeback.
LINUX_FADV_WRITE_WAIT: wait on writeback of all pages in range.
I think that covers all conceivable scenarios.  One thing per operation,
leave the decisions and tuning up to the application.  And it gives us two
operations which are also useful in association with regular write().
