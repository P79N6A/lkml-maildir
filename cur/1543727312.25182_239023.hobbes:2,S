Just curious, do you know if other cases/optimizations where the
callee clobbers arguments on stack ?

OK, is there is consensus on this ? 
We'd have to make the code check for stack boundary etc and probably 
compare and copy back only if there has been a change.

Right, so making the copy dependent on !CONFIG_REGPARM wouldn't
make sense would it ?
