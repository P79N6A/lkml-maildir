    having a hard time giving a sympathetic ear to anyone try to
    change the well established, and consistent (barring the storage
    venduhs), standard.
And disks by the GB where GB == 1000^3 so I don't see any problem in
moving from KB to KiB and friends ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE STANDARDIZED
BEYOND THE KERNEL and nothing will change this.
