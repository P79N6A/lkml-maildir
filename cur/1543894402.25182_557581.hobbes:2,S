Logical fallacy. The two statements are semantically equivalent, and the draw 
and allure of "Open Source" is that the software continually gets better at 
doing its job, grows more features, etc... *ALL* because the modifications 
*DO* get "given back".
Because it is *VERY* hard to keep a modification *PRIVATE* and avoid 
the "distribution" clauses of the GPL the belief that it "doesn't require 
giving changes back" is technically and literally true, but is false in 
practice.
