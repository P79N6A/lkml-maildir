Well, I'm not, but ...
AFAIK, the main issue is: If I write some data to the start of block N, I
get a bit pattern. If I write the same data *anywhere* else (the middle of
block N, the start of block M != N, a different on-disk bit pattern must
result.
If there are identical bit patterns, then the system is vulnerable.
Obviously, this vulnerability doesn't depend on whether you're using
cryptoloop or dm-crypt.
