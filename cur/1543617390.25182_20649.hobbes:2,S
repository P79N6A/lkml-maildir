Hi.
I just tried the sched-O1-2.4.17-I0.patch and interactive performance
is unbelieveable bad!
- When I start compiling (not niced) s.th. the X server never starts!
I have to kill it remotely and do a chvt ...
- So I stopped(!!) the compilation to start XFree. During a CPU
intensive application I can drag the windows with < 1 frame per
second! I never dragged a window arround in such a low speed! (again
nothing reniced - just one gcc running ...)
