Since about 2.5.32 that API has been
     void *usb_buffer_alloc(usb_device *, size, mem_flags, dma_addr_t *)
Sure -- when dma_alloc() is available, we should be able to make it
inline completely.  Done correctly it should be an object code shrink.

With 'dma_device' being pretty much the 'whatsit' I mentioned:  some state
(from platforms that need it, like u64 dma_mask and maybe a list of pci
pools to use with dma_malloc), plus methods basically like James' signatures
from 'struct bus_dma_ops'.
Yes, that'd be something that might be the platform implementation (often
pci, if it doesn't vanish like on x86), something customized (choose dma
paths on the fly) or just BUG() out.

I can agree to that in scenarios like relying on DMA ops with hardware
known not to support them.  If it ever happens, there's deep confusion.
But not in the case of generic dma "map this buffer" operations failing
because of issues like temporary resource starvation; or almost any
other temporary allocation failure that appears after the system booted.

Actually it isn't necessarily ... some host controllers talk I/O space
using FIFOs for commands and data, rather than memory mapping registers,
shared memory request schedules, and DMAing to/from the kernel buffers.
Linux would want a small tweak to support those controllers; maybe it'd
be as simple as testing whethere there's a dma_whatsit object pointer.
The usb_buffer_*map*() calls could now be inlined, but I thought I'd rather
only leave one copy of all the "don't go through null pointer" checking.
If we ever reduce such checking in USB, those routines would all be
good candidates for turning into inlined calls to dma_*() calls.
