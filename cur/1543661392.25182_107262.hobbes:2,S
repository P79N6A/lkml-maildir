Why would it use the maximum socket for a connection with low to
no acks, ie low to no throughput?  Seems like the connection would
have to scale up to full speed/sliding-window, which would require the DoS guy
to have large receive bandwidth, and also enough precision to stop acking
as soon as the window gets big (but before the object download has
completed.)  This does not seem like a great DoS to me.
On my system, the default memory seems to be about 80k (docs say it
is based on how much memory I have (128MB)).  How big can N get?
If N is 10k I can be DOS'd for only 800k?
