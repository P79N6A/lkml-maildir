I am not sure if I see the behavior of the kernel mentioned above, but
it seems that once the swap partition is used,
it may not be released forever : kernel 2.4.x.
Background:
I experienced a very strange X server crash (when a certain page
is access via netscape, and a string is searched successively,
on the second or the third search, the X server crash.)
I downloaded the Xfree 86 source file to re-create the problem and
see where the segmentation error of X server occurs by having a server
with debug symbols in it, and finally
traced it to an incorrect pointer value used in the backing store bitblt
routine.
However, I can't see the pointer value is an incorrect one at all.
(Maybe I am not familar enough with mmap and unmap calls invoked
by malloc() and free().)
Also, I was a little surprised to see a bug of this nature to remain
in X server at this stage.
Anyway, suspecting some sort of VM problem on the kernel side,
I wrote the attached program and run it to see
the behavior of the system when swap partition was first used.
(The situation where X server crashes is when the system is
just about to use Swap in my current config: 256 MB memory
and 80MB swap).
After running the few invocation of the attached program with
varying arguments, I noticed that once the swap is used (I view it
usinx xosview from X or cat /proc/meminfo ).
the used swap does not seem to get released!?
I thought it was suspicious, but didn't speak up since if this were
a bug, this would  indeed be a showstopper for many commercial
application.
Someone must have realized this and fixed it already, so I thought.
From the current discussion, I notice that this may be indeed
an unwanted behavior.
If this is a bug of 2.4.x VM, then I think some installations
would appreciate it very much.
