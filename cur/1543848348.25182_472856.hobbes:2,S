Which kernel version did you say you were running.
This appears to be a case of calling put_files_struct without changing
the pointer in the task_struct.  So we are reading a stale pointer
in get_files_struct.
It looks like the patch below added fixed a bug that has the same symptoms
as what you are describing.  So I suspect this is fixed in linus's tree
already.
