Subject: [PATCH 1/2] firewire: fw-sbp2: fix refcounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/354

Since patch "fw-sbp2: use an own workqueue (fix system responsiveness)"
increased parallelism between fw-sbp2 and fw-core, it was possible that
fw-sbp2 didn't release the SCSI device when the FireWire device was
disconnected.
This happened if sbp2_update() ran during sbp2_login(), because a bus
reset occurred during sbp2_login().  The sbp2_login() work would [try
to] reschedule itself because it failed due to the bus reset, and it
would _not_ drop its reference on the target.  However, sbp2_update()
would schedule sbp2_login() too before sbp2_login() rescheduled itself
and hence sbp2_update() would take an additional reference.  And then
we would have one reference too many.
The fix is to _always_ drop the reference when leaving the sbp2_login()
work.  If the sbp2_login() work reschedules itself, it takes a
reference, but only if it wasn't already rescheduled by sbp2_update().
Ditto in the sbp2_reconnect() work.
The resulting code is actually simpler than before:  We _always_ take
a reference when successfully scheduling work.  And we _always_ drop
a reference when leaving a workqueue job.  No exceptions.
