With the remark that (at least) the PIT is accessed at a time that 
microseconds and hence udelay are still a total fiction, this looks obvious 
otherwise.
Now with respect to the original pre port 80 "jmp $+2" I/O delay (which the 
Pentium obsoleted) I suppose it'll probably be okay even without fixing that 
specifically but do note such -- it's a vital part of the problem.
