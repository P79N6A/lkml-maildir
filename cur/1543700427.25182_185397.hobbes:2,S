Well, since you're using raid1, you should be able to pass a root=/dev/hda1 (or
whatever your / is located) using the same kernel and at least boot using this
kernel. Then maybe you can use dmesg etc.. to see what the driver is actually
doing. From your original post, it looks like you're using Lilo, so you'll need
to boot using the old kernel first and change the lilo entry.
