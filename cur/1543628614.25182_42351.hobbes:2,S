That's very nice for a system where cost is no object, but ATAPI/IDE is
where the bulk of Linux system are running. Putting the CD on another
cable is realistic (the system I hung does that) but putting the CD on IDE
and the disk on SCSI is not cost effective compared to fixing the hang in
software.

It would also be nice if the other IDE channels were given to "somebody
who could use it," but that would appear in some cases not to happen.

  As above, another type of bus is not cost effective, another IDE cable
doesn't solve the problem, no matter what theory says.
