User error.
You cannot write working SIGFPE handlers without understanding the
underlying FP instruction set and its exception model, and being
prepared to write CPU- and OS-specific code.
In particular, on modern x86, an SSE2 FP instruction that raises
an exception will be set to restart in the resumption state.
It's up to your handler to either bypass the restart (longjmp),
or to update the resumption state so that it can be resumed without
triggering an infinite loop. Your handler can do this by masking
exceptions, changing the operands of the failed FP instruction,
or by changing the PC so that the failed instruction is skipped
(your handler may want to emulate the instruction in this case).
This is not a kernel problem.
