Subject: [ PATCH 0/6 ] UML - Finish host file I/O fix, page fault speedup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/12/194

These are 2.6.22 material.
The first three finish getting rid of the bogus host file I/O code.
It turns out that all callers of the old code could have just used the
new code.  I don't know why I was unable to log in when I earlier just
did the quick and simple conversion.
Patch 4 removes some debugging code accidentally included in the
rewrite of the page table walking code.
Patch 5 is a bit of deadlock avoidance.
Patch 6 redoes the host side of page fault handling, with a noticable
performance improvement on a kernel build.
