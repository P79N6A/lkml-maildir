The more you try to "de-claw" these sleep exploits the less effective you make 
your precious interactive estimator. Feel free to keep adding endless tweaks 
to undo the other tweaks in order to try and achieve what SD has by design. 
You'll end up with an incresingly complex state machine design of 
interactivity tweaks and interactivity throttlers all fighting each other to 
the point where the intearactivity estimator doesn't do anything. What's the 
point in that? Eventually you'll have an estimator throttled to the point it 
does nothing and you end up with something far less interactive than SD which 
is as interactive as fairness allows, unlike mainline.
