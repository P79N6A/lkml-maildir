I noticed this remark in the ip-route cref document:
equalize
-- allow packet by packet randomization on multipath routes. Without this
modifier route will be frozen to one selected nexthop, so that load
splitting will occur only on per-flow base. equalize works only if the
kernel is patched. 
Is it still true that a patch is needed or has this now been integrated
into the kernel?
