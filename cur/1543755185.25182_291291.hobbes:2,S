So, I did more tests. As I wrote previously, it's normal that radeonfb
as a module doesn't work when offb is in the kernel, we don't quite have
an infrastructure to deal with driver "replacement" yet.
It seems -mm2 definitely has some problems regarding loading of modules,
it pretty much fails loading all of them for me with some
kobject_register errors, I haven't really found out what was up, but
then, I didn't have much time neither.
radeonfb built-in operations seem to be ok on my PowerBook3,5 (ATI M9
based), I'll try on a PowerBook5,4 (same as yours) tomorrow hopefully.
Does the machine hang with the screen completely cleared ? Do you see
the penguin logo ? Did you try just using pmac_defconfig ?
Ben.
