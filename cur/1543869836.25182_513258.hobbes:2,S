    [PATCH] irq: Remove set_native_irq_info
    This patch replaces all instances of "set_native_irq_info(irq, mask)"
    with "irq_desc[irq].affinity = mask".  The latter form is clearer
    uses fewer abstractions, and makes access to this field uniform
    accross different architectures.
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c: In function `setup_IO_APIC_irqs':
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:1357: error: structure has no member named `affinity'
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c: In function `io_apic_set_pci_routing':
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:2878: error: structure has no member named `affinity'
The original version was an empty function if !CONFIG_SMP, struct irq_desc only has 'affinity' on SMP.
