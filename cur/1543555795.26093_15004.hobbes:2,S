Now if there would be simple _unified_ system for switching debug code
on/off, it would be a real win. That  recompilation-capable enduser would
not need much knowledge to go "General Setup" or newly created
"Optimization" section and switch debugging off/on for _all_ network
drivers or ide drivers for example.

Yess
Lets say LDBG_* namespace, 
macros being in general form:
 LDBG_OPERATION(OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL,SUBSYSTEM,MODULE,ACTION, operation params..)
OPERATIONS would be first likely:
	ASSERT_PRINT, PRINT, ASSERT_PANIC
OPTIMIZATION_LEVELs would be first:
	DEVELOP, ALPHA, BETA, TEST, RELEASE, PRODUCTION, FINETUNED, EMBEDDED 
SUBSYSTEMS:
	memory, fs, network, drivers(network, fs,...), 
	divided to about 20 sections or so.
MODULE: would be current module
ACTION: division inside module :
	DATA_UP, DATA_DOWN, INIT, CLEANUP, CONFIGURE, ToUserpace,FromUserSpace
	... etc. about 15-25 divisions.
LDBG_DECLARE_DEBUG_VAR(OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL, SUBSYSTEM, MODULE)
woudl declare a global unsigned int subsystem_module_debug = 0 and
also sysctl interface to change it.
the var would have ACTION bitfields, so user can control debug output
runtime for the module.
