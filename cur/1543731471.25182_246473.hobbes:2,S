Hate to say it, but apparently symlinking out of metas oopses, but that
should be trivial to fix?

Not to be disrespectful, but Hans has sometimes taken personal shots on the
lists and that's not a productive approach. Not that he'd be the only one
around to do so.
Seems to me, as Christoph said, that some other Namesys guy than Hans should
participate in the Al/Linus branch of the thread with ideas.
Certainly the VFS may have to be extended right about now, so someone who
knows the exact details of Reiser4 should offer ideas and I'm not so sure
it's Hans. Looks like he had the ideas but not the implementation.
There's also the risk that Reiser4's implementation's don't really bend
into even a modified/extended VFS because of the plugins?
That's definitely something that has to be approached properly...
