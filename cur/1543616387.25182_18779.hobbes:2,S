Hi!
Is there $subject inside eg version 2.4.17 of Linux kernel? I've been told
that this chip was used on boards named 'wd7xxx' inside kernel config.
However after eyeballing the source (drivers/scsi/wd7000.c) it seems that
it's for ISA cards but my card is PCI one:
01:09.0 SCSI storage controller: Western Digital 33C296A
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 66 (1250ns min, 1500ns max), cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 11
        Region 0: I/O ports at 1000 [size=256]
        Region 1: Memory at 40200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
Is there any hope to use this scsi adaptor with Linux?
Thanx in advance.
