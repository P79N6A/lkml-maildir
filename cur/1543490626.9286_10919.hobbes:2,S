Why SRAM? The nice thing about SRAM is its low latencies. If you're
slurping a whole track off a disk, latencies shouldn't be an issue;
you might need lots of bandwidth, but you can get high bandwidth from
DRAM.
Besides, 100 megabytes of SRAM is 100*(8 bits in a byte)*(6
transistors for an SRAM cell) = 2.4 billion transistors! Ignoring
issues of cost, where exactly do they put all those chips? I don't
know much about the semiconductor state-of-the-art, but I do know that
at current levels of integration it would be a squeeze to fit that lot
on the back of a disk.

Static RAM? As in the stuff that L2 caches are made out of? As in the
stuff that currently costs several times as DRAM for the same
capacity?
If static RAM can be manufactured economically in disk-sized lumps,
then WTF is the point of putting it at the other side of a PCI bus (or
any other IO bus for that matter) from the processor. I'd have N
gigabytes of the stuff as my main memory, thank you very much (having
it battery-backed-up would be the icing on the cake).
