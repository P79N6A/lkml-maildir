I am posting this mail here because I have tried posting on many news
groups, but no one seems to know how.  Also, I did read documentation but
could not figure out how to do this in Linux 2.4 kernel

Subject: 3 NIC cards problem
Hi,
I have a system with 3 NIC cards, each on a seperate subnet, with IP
addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1.
I have a program listening for socket connections on 192.168.1.1, port 80.
What I want to do is have incomming connection requets for IP 192.168.2.1
and 192.168.3.1 on port 80 also be handled by my server running on
192.168.1.1:80
How do I do this in Linux?
Thanks
Lee
