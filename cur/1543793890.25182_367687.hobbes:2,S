That is true, but only if we print the virtualized pid.  Before we go
and actually implement the pid virtualization, we probably need a
thorough audit of this kind of stuff to see what we really want.
There will always be a "real pid" (the real thing in tsk->__pid) backing
whatever is virtualized and presented to getpid().  I would imagine that
this is the same that needs to go into dmesg.
