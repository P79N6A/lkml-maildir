Perhaps I should have been more detailed.  At the top of /var/log/dmesg, you
have the memory map returned by e820.  Something like the following, which I
pulled from and old post:
e820: 0009f800 @ 00000000 (usable)
e820: 00000800 @ 0009f800 (reserved)
e820: 00010000 @ 000f0000 (reserved)
e820: 03f00000 @ 00100000 (usable)
e820: 00010000 @ fec00000 (reserved)
e820: 00010000 @ fee00000 (reserved)
e820: 00080000 @ fff80000 (reserved)
e820: 00000000 @ 00000000 (usable)
If you said "mem=0x9f800@0 mem=0x3f00000@0x100000", you would have the same
areas of usable RAM.  If you want to exclude some area, just break up what
ever region it is in, and report the parts on either side as separate
regions.

How well can I specify which area to exclude? Only one defective
segment comes up when I do a RAM test (by using TuffTest Pro).
