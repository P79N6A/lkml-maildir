You better.  VMA space exhaustion is one of the reasons for introducing
remap_file_pages().  It's an oracle-killer.  Like everything else ;)

Nope, we're slack.

OK, that's not so bad.  So if you don't use the feature the overhead is 4
bytes/vma.
If you _do_ use the feature, what is the overhead?  12 bytes for each and
every vma?  Or just for the vma's which have a non-default policy?
Your patch takes the CONFIG_NUMA vma from 64 bytes to 68.  It would be nice
to pull those 4 bytes back somehow.
