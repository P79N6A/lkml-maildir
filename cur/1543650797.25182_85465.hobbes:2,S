Okay... Have ~/bin/phonebook and I'd like it to be rw- to me, r-- to
jarka and mj, and --- to everyone else. How do I do that without ACLs?
Adding a group is root-only operation.
This seems like a pretty common situation to me, and current solutions
are not nice. [I guess ~/bin/ with --x and
~/bin/my-secret-password-only-jarka-and-mj-knows/phonebook would solve
the problem, but...!]
