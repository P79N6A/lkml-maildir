Sorry to bother you with a stupid question, but I don't know enough to
understand this.
I moved a machine which has a 3c905 connected to a linksys autosense
10/100 hub.  I set no options on the 3c905 module.
I get millions of dreaded:

Nov 28 08:58:15 adglinux1 kernel: eth0: Transmit error, Tx status register 82.
Nov 28 08:58:15 adglinux1 kernel: Probably a duplex mismatch.  See Documentation/networking/vortex.txt
Nov 28 08:58:15 adglinux1 kernel:   Flags; bus-master 1, dirty 77261(13) current 77263(15)
What exactly does this mean?  How do I fix it?  I have looked at
Documentation/networking/vortex.txt, but I don't know what this
HDX/FDX means exactly, and how works with a hub or switch.  Would my
problem be fixed by replacing the hub with a "switch"?
