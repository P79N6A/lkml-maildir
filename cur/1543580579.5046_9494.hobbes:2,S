The case for files and has already been justified.   
The performance gain of reading pages that are contiguous on disk has
been justified. 
The only problem thing that has not been shown is that swap pages that
are used together are located near each other in swap.
As for design choices simplicity, maintainability and
comprehensiblility, tend to be more important than absolute
performance.  This lets bugs be fixed, and the big changes that tend
to be the biggest wins happen.

I won't argue that.  My gut just says we should work to improve the
disk addresses, so it isn't luck. ;)  And only if we fail in that
hack up the efficient simple policy, that we have for reading disk
data in.
Of course since I'm not actually writing the code at the moment
this is all hot air :)
