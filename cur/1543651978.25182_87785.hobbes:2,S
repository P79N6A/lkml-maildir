NMIs cannot be masked, they are by definition non-maskable :-).  You can 
get an NMI while executing an NMI.
NMIs are edge-triggered going into the processor.  For external 
level-generating inputs, this is fine, because if two NMIs are occuring, 
you would handle the first, clear it, and there's some code that will 
turn off and back on the external NMI, if it is still asserted (by 
another input) you would get another NMI.  From what I can tell (by 
inference, not by direct documentation) at least the IO APIC version is 
pulsed, because there is no code to turn it off.  If a pulsed and 
another NMI occur at the same time, it is possible to miss one.  It may 
be that this is not important.  If so, it's easy to change it to only 
handle the first one (since the handlers are supposed to return a value 
saying if they handle the NMI or not).  I'm not sure about this, maybe 
someone who is more familiar with the hardware could comment?

An NMI-based timer?  I can see the use if you REALLY need accurate 
intervals, but you can't do much in an NMI, no spinlocks, even.
