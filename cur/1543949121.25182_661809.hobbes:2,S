Those machines can netboot, or boot from USB. Might be easier for you.
For that sort of test, usually, I just netboot a zImage with built-in
initrd, using an initrd with all the tools I need on it.
(A way to build that sort of initrd or initramfs is OpenWRT though I use
a home made one).
You can netboot any newworld mac with that OF command:
boot enet:tftp_server_ip,filename
(you need to make sure you have a DHCP around to give it an address).
However, make _SURE_ you use the file arch/powerpc/boot/zImage.pmac (and
not any other zImage).
To build one with an initrd included, put the initrd in
arch/powerpc/boot as "ramdisk.image.gz" and do make zImage.initrd.
That should result in a file name zImage.initrd.pmac that you can
netboot.
Cheers,
Ben.
