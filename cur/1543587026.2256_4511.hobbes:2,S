Subject: Oops on shutdown with 2.4.3

Hello...
I received the following Oops several times since upgrading to 2.4.3. The 
Oops always occurs on shutdown, after the machine was under some meory 
pressure (128 Megs RAM, 256 Megs Swap, 131MB File mmapped for linear reading, 
another 100MB in khexedit, and some 30-40MB of data in memory in a file 
conversion utility.) While working the machine bahves as expected (runs 
smooth, swapping on changing apps and so on), but when shutting down the Oops 
occurs.
Unfortunately a debian upgrade removed the -x switch from my klogd, so all I 
have is the decoded Oops out of klogd. I am now "waiting" for the Oops to 
happen again, so I can run it through ksymoops, but AFAICT the output of 
klogd looks OK.
The machine is an Athlon 600 on an Asus K7M Board. If needed I can provide 
more info. I would be willing to try out patches and/or help debugging as far 
as I can (not a kernel hacker...).
