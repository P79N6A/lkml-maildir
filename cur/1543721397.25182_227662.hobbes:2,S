LVM2/device-mapper diagnostics
==============================
If you use the 'lvs' reporting tool, we'll get fuller information more 
concisely, so we can check for any anomalies. 
[Unlikely to be any based on what you've posted so far, but worth
eliminating the possibility.]
Run:
  vgs -v
  lvs -v
  pvs -v
Can you confirm that you're not running *any* LVM or device-mapper
commands during your backup sequence?
Confirm the versions by running:
  lvm version
  dmsetup targets
And dump the static device-mapper state, by running:
  dmsetup -v table
  dmsetup status
[I'll get that fixed to provide a column-based output too.]
And finally mount sysfs and run
  ls -ld .../block/dm-*
[This lot ought to get scripted.]
