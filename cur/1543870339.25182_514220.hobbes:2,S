Kevent sent additional 525 pages ((311792800-309760000)/3872) - that is why 
number for kevent is higher - it uses edge-triggered handler (which you 
asked to remove from epoll), which can produce false-positives, for 
absolute result in that case ret_data must be checked where poll flags 
were stored (before). 'ab' does not count additional data as new requests 
and does not count them in 'requests per second'.
Even if it could do so, additional 500 requests can not provide 35%
higher rate.
For example, lighttpd results are the same for kevent and epoll and
'Total transferred' and 'HTML transferred' numbers change between runs both 
for epoll and kevent.
