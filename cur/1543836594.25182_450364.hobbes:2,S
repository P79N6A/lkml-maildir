For privileged domains that have hardware privileges and need to send 
IPIs or something it might make sense.  Othewsie, there is no issue.

Yes, I hope not too.

Yes, this is all just a crazy idea, not an actual proposal.

Hmm, a quantum bus would only allow one reader of each quantum bit.  So 
you couldn't broadcast without daisy chaining everything.  Could be an 
issue.

It doesn't stop Linux from using the provided primitives in any way is 
sees fit.  So it doesn't top evolution in that sense.  What it does stop 
is having the Linux hypervisor interface grow antlers and have new 
hooves grafted onto it.  What it sorely needed in the interface is a way 
to probe and detect optional features that allow it to grow independent 
of one particular hypervisor vendor.
