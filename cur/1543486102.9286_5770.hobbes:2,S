Arrrgh!!!! Ignoring DSPs, 1970's hardware, and other junk...
char          8
short        16
int          32 (goodbye Windows 3.1, we won't miss you)
long         same as a pointer, except 32 for broken Win64
long long    64 (not 128, even on the Alpha)
Pointers are 32 bits on normal hardare and 64 bits on good hardware.
Pointers (and long) are the size of int nativly handled by your CPU.
Plain int is smaller than the native size on a 64-bit CPU.
If you have any of these:
   8-bit Apple ][
  16-bit 80286
  18-bit PDP-7
  30-bit IBM mainframe
  36-bit Honeywell mainframe
  60-bit Cray
Just drag-and-drop it into the nearest landfill. You might need
a backhoe and dumptruck for some of them, but just think of the
space (rent?) and electricity that you will save.
(you might want to strip them for copper, gold, and steel first)
