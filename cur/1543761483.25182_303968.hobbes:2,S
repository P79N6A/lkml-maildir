SUSPEND_PD_PAGES is not necessary in swsusp any more. :-)  We can just
drop it, together with the pagedir_order variable, which is not used.  I'll
send a patch later today.
BTW, I'm going to post some clean ups for swsusp.c, but I'd like the last
changes to settle down in mainline before, if you don't mind.
Greets,
Rafael
