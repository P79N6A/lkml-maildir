Hi,
Got a little problem with ACPI on a Thinkpad X31. I am running kernel
2.6.5 on it, and am experimenting with suspending it (to state S3).
It suspends alright, but switches on the backlight. That is not quite so
useful. Is there anything I can do to switch that backlight of through
ACPI?
The sleep script switches off the displays in X (works, tried and
tested) but once ACPI drops into sleep state, the backlight comes back
on. :-/
I am game for testing patches etc.
