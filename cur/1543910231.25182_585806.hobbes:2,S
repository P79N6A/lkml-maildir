http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-07/msg01758.html
is a follow-up in the thread on the gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org mailing list,
which began with:
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-07/msg01677.html
that was posted by Jan Kubicka, as he quotes in that initial posting,
after I had submitted:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/23/252
which was a (wrong) patch to "rectify" what I thought was the "bogus"
"+m" constraint, as per the quoted extract from gcc docs (that was
given in that (wrong) patch's changelog).
That's when _I_ came to know how GCC interprets "+m", but probably
this has been explained on those lists multiple times. Who cares,
anyway?

True.
