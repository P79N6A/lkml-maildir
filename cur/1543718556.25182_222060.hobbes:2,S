Hello,
around last september there was a discussion about the linux kernel
recognizing "supperfloppys" as disks with bogus partition tables.
Linux Torvalds wrote at one point in the discussion:

The discussion seemed to fade out with no visible result, and for example my
USB stick "ID 0d7d:1420 Apacer" with a floppy as second partition gets
recognized as:
SCSI device sdc: 2880 512-byte hdwr sectors (1 MB)
sdc: Write Protect is off
 sdc: sdc1 sdc2 sdc3 sdc4
Find appended a patch that does the 0x00/0x80 "boot flag" checks. Please
discuss and consider for inclusion into the kernel.
Thanks
PS: CC me for faster reaction, as I only follow the mailing list via the
MARC mailing list archive.
