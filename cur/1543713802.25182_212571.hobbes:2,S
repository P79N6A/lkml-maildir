Yep, you're right. I just regurgitated the same code. I'll pull my head out and try again :(

I appreciate the credit but I don't see that it addressed my original 
objection -- the starvation issue.
Do you cap the number of per-array requests a "1024 / n_arrays", or 
something like that?  You mentioned that the hardware has a maximum of 
1024 outstanding commands, for all devices.  The two typical solutions 
are a round-robin queue (see carmel.c) or limiting each array such that 
if all arrays are full of commands, the total outstanding never exceeds 
1024.
This patch may be OK for -mm, I would rather not see it go upstream -- 
it seems to me you are choosing to decrease stability to obtain a 
performance increase.  I think you can increase performance without 
decreasing stability.
