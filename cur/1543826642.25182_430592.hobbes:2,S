This means the design was incorrect for CPU hotplug (which needs
to work anyways). suspend is just the most popular user of CPU
hotplug.

Make it work properly for CPU hotplug for individual CPU and then in suspend
you take care of "global" state and the last CPU.

You need to disable the nmi watchdog on CPU hotunplug too,
it's no good to keep the NMI running.
