Subject: [RFC] patch for invalid packet time from ULOG target of iptables
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/24/50

I've just started playing with the ULOG target in
iptables, and I've noticed that the 'timestamp_sec'
member of the ulog_packet_msg_t struct paseed to
the user is always 0 for locally generated packets.
I was thinking of patching the ipt_ulog_target
function in net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ULOG.c to
check if timestamp_sec is 0 and if so, set it
to the current time by adding code to test
'timestamp_sec' after it's been set. E.g;
    pm->timestamp_sec = (*pskb)->stamp.tv_sec;
    pm->timestamp_usec = (*pskb)->stamp.tv_usec;
+   if ( pm->timestamp_sec == 0 ) {
+      pm->timestamp_sec = currrent time;
+   }
Any comments?
