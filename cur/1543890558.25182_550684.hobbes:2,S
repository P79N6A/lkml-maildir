Of course. FYI, XFS only issues barriers on *async* writes.
But barrier semantics - as far as they've been described by everyone
but you indicate that the barrier write is guaranteed to be on stable
storage when it returns.

XFS relies on the block being stable before any other write
goes to disk. That is the semantic that the barrier I/Os currently
have. How that is implemented in the device is irrelevant to me,
but if I issue a barrier I/O, I do not expect *any* I/O to be
reordered around it.

Yes, and that is provided to XFS by the fact that barrier I/Os are
full barriers....
Cheers,
Dave.
