Hi Nagar,
Thanks for your response and time.
Yes a good question.
(a) The short tasks to measure the response time itself after applying the 
division of load and before.
(b) The long tasks means HPC tasks to measure the load signal after 
applying the division of load and before.
I have run it for 600s, 1000s, and 1500s.
The both these tests were successful.
What I want to document is some standard tests just like using lmbench and 
re-aim-7.
I will go through your web site as well
Thanks
