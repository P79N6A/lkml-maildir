Hi,
I'm wondering what the plans are for more accurate and more useful performance 
metrics in upcoming kernels.
CPU Utilization by process is apparently a known-inaccuracy.
There are no disk I/O metrics per process.
CPU Queue Length doesn't appear to be available?
Etc.
Linux clearly falls behind the competition in this area. It makes it rather 
tough to do system performance analysis on a Linux box!  :-)
Is there a plan to deal with these issues?  ETA's?
Cordially,
Scott
