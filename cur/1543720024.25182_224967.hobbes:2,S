True.

I'm not suggesting a new LSM module.  I'm suggesting modifying the existing 
LSM code to handle this cleanly.  We already have a function 
(security_bprm_secureexec) that does something like this, and, in fact, 
it's probably the right thing to test here.
I'm currently compiling a new patch (modified from my last caps cleanup) 
that makes a new bitfield for this stuff.  I don't know if it's worth 
applying, but I'll send it off to Andrew once I convince myself it works.
