Can you try the patch below (made against 2.2.2-pre2)?  The key is to
recognise that when we wake up bdflush, we need to take into account how
many dirty buffers there are; but when we decide whether or not to wait
for the bdflush pass to complete, it is BUF_LOCKED, not BUF_DIRTY,
buffers which are important.  If we don't wait for bdflush once
BUF_LOCKED grows too high, then we will simply continue to create more
locked IO buffers until the request queues are completely saturated.
For low memory configurations, triggering the flush purely on the
percentage of dirty buffers makes no sense at all, so the patch also
starts a wakeup when the total locked+dirty memory exceeds a certain
threshold (currently 15% of memory).  
The patch also includes the previously posted code to allow both sync
and bdflush to refile unlocked buffers on the locked list back onto the
clean list, to tidy up after async IO.
Only with all three of these items in place can I sustain decent
performance on a 16MB box while doing a background heavy
file/block-device write, as well as on a large 64MB configuration.
