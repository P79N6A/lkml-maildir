I was starting down this track in my tree, but I'm glad you beat me to it ;). 
Your initial limit (10) seems low if you consider binds as mounts.  I
can easily see a user using more than 10 binds in an environment.  As
Ram mentioned earlier - we are going to run into problems with the
shared-subtree stuff if propagations into private namespaces count as
a new mount.  We need to think through how we are going to deal with
this.

I think the FS_SAFE stuff needs to be part of this patch.  Folks made
a pretty good argument that mounting corrupted images with certain
file systems could be a really bad thing.  I'm not sure on the whole
sysfs configurable approach -- it seems like more advanced policies
would be best handled in user-space.
My  major complaint is that I really think having user mounts without
requiring them to be in a user's private namespace creates quite a
mess.  It potentially pollutes the system's namespace and opens up the
possibility of all sorts of synthetic file system "traps".  I'd rather
see the private namespace stuff enforced before enabling user-mounts.
