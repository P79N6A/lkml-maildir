Somebody also needs to think about setuid root programs doing:
if (!vfork()) {setreuid(Someone_Else,Someone_Else); /* Stuff */; execve(...);}
While Someone_Else is busy sending SIGSTOPs to all their processes.
I know setuid programs _ought_ to be aware of security issues and
presumably not use vfork() here.
Is this change going to affect any of the existing ones?
