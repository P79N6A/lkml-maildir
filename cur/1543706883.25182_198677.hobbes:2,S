Yes, that's it.

Well ... people did ask, even in the old api.  The excuse always was
that the cache coherency aspect deals exclusively with the CPU cache. 
Now you're adding an API specifically to deal with possible bus caches,
I just wanted it to be crystal clear that you can't use the bus cache
API for flushing posted writes.
