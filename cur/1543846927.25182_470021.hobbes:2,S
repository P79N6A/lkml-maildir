That's part of the reason for the changes that I made to the clocksource
API . It makes it so instrumentation, with other things, can generically
read a low level cycle clock. Like on PPC you would read the
decrementer, and on x86 you would read the TSC . However, the
application has no idea what it's reading.
I submitted one version to LKML already, but I'm planning to submit
another version shortly.
