If you're reading more than the size of your on-drive buffer then you'll be limited by the speed at
which the information can be grabbed off the drive--in your case, 38.1MB/s, which is quite good.
ATA33/66/100/133 only makes a significant difference in speed when you're reading from the on-drive
cache.
