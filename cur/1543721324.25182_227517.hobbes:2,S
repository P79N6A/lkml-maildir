Dean is correct and incorrect ;-)
If you are using schedule_work() or schedule_task(), blocking for 
extended periods of time would be very undesirable.  We see this on 
occasion in 2.6 uniprocessor, where a long-running keventd task may 
block a console or tty update.
In 2.6, the solution is easy... create your own private workqueue.  No 
such solution in 2.4 (though I would argue that workqueues would help 
drivers, if accepted into 2.4 at this late stage).
