this reminds me of another related matter that is not fixed yet, which bug
caused XFree86 to crash if it was linked against the new libpthreads - in
vm86 mode we did not save/restore %gs [and %fs] properly, which breaks
new-style threading. The attached patch is against the 2.4 backport of the
threading stuff, i'll do a 2.5 patch after christmas eve :-)
