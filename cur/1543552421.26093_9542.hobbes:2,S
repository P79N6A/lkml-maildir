Hi,
sorry for posting something offtopic - but this might be for interrest to
everyone who would like to try a Linux Kernel 2.4.0 - based system.
A new development release of the ROCK Linux Distribution came out 
yesterday. ROCK Linux 1.3.11 is based on the Linux Kernel 2.4.0-test9,
GNU Libc 2.1.3, GCC 2.95.2 and Binutils 2.10.0.26.
That means that every singe package has been built with this software
components, on a system running this software components. We had some
minor problems with the new kernel header files, but no real troubles.
Here is the full announcement for those of you who are interested:
ANNOUNCE: ROCK Linux 1.3.11                                     [ 2000-10-23 ]
The ROCK Linux Developers are pleased to announce version 1.3.11 of the
ROCK Linux Distribution - a Linux Distribution for Admins, Hackers, Geeks
and skilled unix users.
ROCK Linux 1.3.11 is a development release and not intended for production
environments. It's based on the Linux Kernel 2.4.0-test9, GNU Libc 2.1.3,
GCC 2.95.2 and Binutils 2.10.0.26. The 1.3.11 release supports Intel
IA-32, Alpha AXP and PowerPC Systems. ROCK Linux uses DevFS, XFree 4.0.1,
GNOME 1.2, Message Passing for Beowulf Clusters and other bleeding edge
technology.
ROCK Linux is based on a simple build system using shell scripts which
allow you to re-build the entire distribution using full optimization for
your CPU or some special adaptions for your needs.  It also makes porting
ROCK Linux to new architectures a simple task.

The ROCK Linux Sources are available for download on the ROCK Linux
Homepage. The package sources used by ROCK Linux will show up on the ROCK
Linux mirrors withing the next couple of days.
A lot of fun and happy hacking,
 - Clifford Wolf (Project Leader)
