You should add p->get_info only _after_ all hwifs of a host are probed,
just like non-modular code does it.  Otherwise you are opening new races.

Same problem as above.
ide_setup_pci_device()+ide_setup_pci_devices() are correct places
to add registering of /proc/ide/<chipset> and /proc/ide/<hwif>.
Even better - you may fix every PCI driver to add these entries
itself and remove these silly ide_pci_host_proc_t-s :-).
