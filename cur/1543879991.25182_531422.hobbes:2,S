Subject: [PATCH 000 of 2] knfsd: Close oopsable race in nfsd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following two patches fix a bug introduced in 
   7b2b1fee30df7e2165525cd03f7d1d01a3a56794
and hence is in 2.6.19 and later.
The first patch is a minimal fix which is suitable for all kernels 
since 2.6.19-pre1.  The second adds some consequent cleaning up
and is probably best left for 2.6.22-rc (and so it not being cc:ed 
to stable@kernel.org).
Thanks,
NeilBrown
