Yes it will be for compatibility reasons : we for sure will not fix all
users of "%s" quickly, so we will have to do our best not to break them.
If it was easy to find them all, we could replace "%s" with "%S" everywhere
and make "%S" the escaped one.
But well, I believe that you convinced me that escaping the "%s" and providing
a new "%S" for secure or special usages might be the way to go.
I will propose a patch soon.
