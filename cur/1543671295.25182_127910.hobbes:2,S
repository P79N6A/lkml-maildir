Yes, Ick.  You might see some kind of Linux-Trusted-Quake club rise up, with 
the specific goal of running cheatless deathmatches, but we are getting very 
far from reality here.
To get cheatless online gaming, you would have to necessarily give up a lot 
of flexibility.  I imagine the likelihood of people running completely 
separate DRM Linux boxes, just to participate in DRM-controlled online games, 
is not high.  Only when if you are faced with absolute necessity of running 
DRM, are you actually going to do it by choice.  There's going to be a whole 
pile of new ways for computers to fail to work too, because of this.  Then 
there's the certainty that there will be exploits - the whole concept is 
inherently fragile, there are just too many parts involved.  From a security 
point of view, we would end up worse off than without it, given a newfound 
false sense of security.
So, just call all of the above a valiant effort on my part to find something 
good about this.  Hopefully, after a few years of silliness and much wasted 
effort, it will all fade away like copy-protected floppy disks.
Regards,
Daniel
