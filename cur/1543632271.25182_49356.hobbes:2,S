I haven't seen complaints about the size of the patch, there are plenty of
patches of similar size.  I've only seen the request to break it up, and
as I showed, it's not that hard, so...
Though I can certainly see why somebody who is weary from a long trip
could react badly to the suggestion that they should go take a further
hike around the block.

The way I see it, all that's required with respect to the db is to give
it its own patch.  Out of regard to Larry, who contributed it, even make
it a BitKeeper patch ;-)
