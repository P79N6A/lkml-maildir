Endre,
Could you tell me the version of e1000 and the PRO/1000 model you were
testing?  This is the first report I've heard of e1000 not working with
vlans.  If the card is in a running system, the information from lspci would
be great.  If not, the 9 digit part number on the card will work (on the
white sticker with a barcode, has a hyphen after the first 3 digits
xxxxxx-xxx).
thanks
	Chris
