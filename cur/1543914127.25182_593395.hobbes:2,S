Yes. I think we differ on our interpretations of "okay". In my interpretation,
it is not OK to use this patch as a way to solve VM or FS or IO scalability
issues, especially not while the alternative approaches that do _not_ have
these problems have not been adequately compared or argued against.

So even after all this time you do not understand what the fundamental
problem is with anti-frag and yet you are happy to waste both our time
in endless flamewars telling me how wrong I am about it.
Forgive me if I'm starting to be rude, Christoph. This is really irritating.
