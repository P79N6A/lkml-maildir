Looks a lot more correct :)
Probably want to eventually convert the code path to be similar to
sys_poll(), though? Maybe with a helper to do the converting? I think
the epoll code can probable use msecs_to_jiffies() + 1 as well, no? I
will wait for your patch to go in and send a patch for these ideas
later.
Thanks,
Nish
