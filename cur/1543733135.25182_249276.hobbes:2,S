This question came to my mind when I was thinking about journal_start in
ext3_prepare_write and copy_from_user issue...
Did you follow that discussion?
In the considered scenario not only the application is not
guaranteed anything till msync(), but all other programs doing regular read()
may also be fooled about the file content, and this idea surprised me.
On the other hand, after a write() other programs also see the new content
without a guarantee that this content corresponds with what is on the disk...

Should the space be allocated on close()?
Who will get the signal if nobody accesses the file anymore?
I'm also thinking about various shell scripts with redirects to files...
