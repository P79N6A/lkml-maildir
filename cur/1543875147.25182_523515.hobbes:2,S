FYI, there are similiar reports on the net, going as far back as May 2006:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.device-mapper.dm-crypt/1636
 
is the oldest one I could find.
Bugzilla entry: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7388
I, too, ran into the bug and failed to reproduce it. However, it might 
be worth knowing that the system went to 100% iowait afterwards.
