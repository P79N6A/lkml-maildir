Thanks for looking at it so quickly.  I want ext3+htree to stabilise as
quickly as possible, and since I had a nice reproducible bug, I may as
well make the most of it.

Yes, I would have guessed that it was related to a tree split.  The
interesting thing to me is that it happened twice in this particular
run, and yet it must be a fairly uncommon occurrence overall (otherwise
it would have been reported before).  I wonder if it really is a rare
event, or it has just gone unnoticed?

Update it in what way?  In principle a rename is an atomic operation, so
other things shouldn't be able to observe the directory in an
intermediate state.
