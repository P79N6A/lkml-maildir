Here is a patch for unlock_buffer in
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/locks.h
extern inline void unlock_buffer(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
        clear_bit(BH_Lock, &bh->b_state);
+     refile_buffer(bh);
        wake_up(&bh->b_wait);
}
Without this patch, bdflush() calls flush_dirty_buffers() which calls
ll_rw_block() for each dirty
buffer.  ll_rw_block() calls make_request() which moves the buffer from
the BUF_DIRTY to
the BUF_LOCKED list for the duration of the IO operation.  When the
IO operation completes,
end_buffer_io_sync() calls unlock_buffer() to clear the BH_Lock state
but never moves the
buffer back to the BUF_CLEAN list.  Next time the buffer is used it's
assumed to be on the
BUF_CLEAN list but it is still in the BUF_LOCKED list.  For starters the
nr_buffers_type[BUF_LOCK]
count never get decremented and the buf lists can probably get
corrupted.
