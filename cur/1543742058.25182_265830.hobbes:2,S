OK. Here are my early consolidated results. Feel free to comment.
                                    2.6.9     RT-U3   RT-V0.4.3
                                  --------- --------- ---------
  XRUN Rate . . . . . . . . . . .     424         8         4    /hour
  Delay Rate (>spare time)  . . .     496         0         0    /hour
  Delay Rate (>1000 usecs)  . . .     940         8         4    /hour
  Maximum Delay . . . . . . . . .    6904       921       721    usecs
  Maximum Process Cycle . . . . .    1449      1469      1590    usecs
  Average DSP CPU Load  . . . . .      38        39        40    %
  Average Context-Switch Rate . .    7480      8929      9726    /sec
Note: all tests were carried out running jackd -v -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100
-p128 -n2 -S -P, loaded with 9 (nine) fluidsynth instances, on a
P4@2.533Ghz laptop, against the onboard sound device (snd-ali5451).
On the RT kernels only, the following optimizations were issued:
   chrt --pid --fifo 90 2                (pidof "ksoftirqd/0" = 2)
   chrt --pid --fifo 60 `pidof "IRQ 5"`  (snd-ali5451)
Take care.
