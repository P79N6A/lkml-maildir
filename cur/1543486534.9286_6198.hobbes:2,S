Yes.  (I think it was) Matti Aarnio who has preliminary patches for
bits of 64bit file support on 32bit machines.  They're mostly VFS-level
at the moment, though, and don't provide anything usable yet.  Don't
expect to be able to use large files under 32bit Linux for a while yet,
but it will happen.

It's already there (and working very nicely) for Alpha and Sparc64.
Of course, by the time you need to process >2Gb of data, traditional i386
won't really cut it anyway.  (Do SGI have plans to release the VW without
all the expensive graphical stuff?  Quite a few people could benefit from
the extra memory/bus bandwidth without having to pay for all the 3D/video
stuff.)
