Finding them is no problem. We have NR_CPUS arrays for this (or other
per CPU mechanisms).
The problem is initializing them correct. There are currently two ways to do 
this: 
- (easier one, used by most subsystems) at startup set up state for 
all possible CPUs.
- (complex one) register a CPU notifier and watch for CPU_UP/DOWN
Because of the first way the per cpu data is currently preallocated for
all hotplug CPUs. You cannot copy the state later because it might be 
undefined then.
To make dynamic changes of possible map work would require to convert all 
users to the second more complex way. Probably a lot of work.

ACPI/mptables has the concept of "disabled" CPUs.  I just bent that a bit
and use it as the number of possible CPUs.
