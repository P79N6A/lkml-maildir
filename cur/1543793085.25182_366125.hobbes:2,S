Hi Andrew,
I would like to find out, what your plans and/or concerns
to push
	reiser4-truncate_inode_pages_range.patch
from your -mm tree to mainline ? I need this for
my madvise(REMOVE) work. And also, I see that 
madvise(REMOVE) is not in -mm2 also. Do you still
have concerns with it ?
Thanks,
Badari
