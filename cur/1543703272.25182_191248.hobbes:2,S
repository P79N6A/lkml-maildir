What if a blocked RT task was woken up by an irq that interrupted
RCU callback processing ? All of a sudden you now have a RT task
in the queue. Isn't this possible ?

OK, but I am not sure how to do this for non-module code.

That is another way to look at it :)

Well there seems to be a difference in opinion about whether the
krcuds should be pervasive or not. Some think they should be,
some thinks they should not be when we aren't aiming for low
latency (say CONFIG_PREEMPT=n).
