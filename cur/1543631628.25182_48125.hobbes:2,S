	Web servers tend to look for all kinds of things that don't exist. For 
example, if you hit "
http://www.mydomain.com/foo"
 is there a file called 
"foo" in the root document directory? Or is "foo" a directory with an 
"index.html" file in it?
	And what if index files can be "index.html", "index.htm", or "index.cgi"? A 
single URL hit can easily involve looking for five files that don't exist 
before you find the one that does.
	Of course, some web servers have their own internal URL->file mapping 
caches. The ideal solution would be to get rid of the negative dentries we 
aren't using (much? recently?) when we want to get some more free memory.
