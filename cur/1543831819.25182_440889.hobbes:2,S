There are versions in both VMS and the ISO filesystem. I have a sneaking 
suspicion that those of us who ever use them are few and far between. 
The other issue is that unless the field is time, programs like make 
can't really use it, at least without becoming Linux specific.
I'm not sure exactly how a "version" value would be used other than 
detecting the fact that the file had been changed in some way. Feel free 
to show me, I seem to come up empty on using this value.
