This is an update of my tree against 2.6.14-git3:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/temp/total-2.6.14-git3-r0.patch.gz
I realise a number of the tosa and ipaq drivers are no longer in sync
with the recent changes in mainline but the other drivers all should be
and cxx00 and c7x0 should work.
This has some interesting alpha code from various places including ALSA
SoC code from Liam Girdwood (I've added a wm8750 codec driver to this
which sort of works on cxx00) and framebuffer console rotation from
Antonino Daplas.
A suitable defconfig is:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/temp/total-2.6.14-git3-r0-defconfig-cxx00
This adds compiles console rotation support into the kernel and enables
it on the commandline. Let Antonino know how much nicer the device is
with this :) 
Cheers,
Richard
