Thanks for finally posting your code.
At the core it's some really nice code dealing with host-based SAS
implementations.  What's not nice is that it's not intgerating with the
SAS transport class I posted, it's duplicating things like LUN disocvery
from the SCSI core code, and adding it's own sysfs representation that's
very different from the way the SCSI core and transport classes do it.
Are you willing to work with us to intgerate it with the infrastructure
we have?
