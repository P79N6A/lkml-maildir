I generated a table of results from the latest glitch1 script, using an 
HTML postprocessor I not *quite* ready to foist on the word. In any case 
it has some numbers for frames per second, fairness of the processor 
time allocated to the compute bound processes which generate a lot of 
other screen activity for X, and my subjective comments on how smooth it 
looked and felt.
The chart is at 
http://www.tmr.com/~davidsen/sched_smooth_01.html
 for 
your viewing pleasure. The only "tuned" result was with sd, since what I 
observed was so bad using the default settings. If any scheduler 
developers would like me to try other tunings or new versions let me know.
