I realize Linus doesn't like ide-scsi, but while it exists I need it to work 
:-)
In 2.5.44 ide-scsi doesn't work with my OnStream DI-30 IDE Tape Drive.
Works fine with 2.4.18 on the same hardware. It's not an osst (the driver
for these devices, which I maintain) problem, the error comes from the
scsi host (ide-scsi).
When I try it, I get the following errors:
Nov  5 17:54:58 fallguy kernel: osst :I: Tape driver with OnStream support 
version 0.9.10

Note the "hdc:" and the "ide-scsi:" lines.
Does anyone know what ide-scsi's status is, and what might have gone wrong for 
me?
Thanks, Willem Riede.
