I just received the following upon mounting a CDRW disk in my
HP-7200i attached to /dev/hdc using scsi emulation (/dev/sr0)
under 2.0.36.
2 root@red:/burner# scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid

I've been receiving many such errors as of late on this drive as
well as other cdrom drives in my system.  The mobo has a VIA MVP3
chipset.  NO DMA/UDMA is being used on this system at all.
The above cd was mounted, and then a "find . -name "ls-*"" was
done to locate all ls-lR files.  at the same time, I used
midnight commander to completely copy the contents of the CD to
my hard drive for modification prior to reburning a new image.
Neither program completed.  ls died giving the above error.
Shortly after, midnight commander gave a red error window
showing:  cannot read source file, input/output error(5).
I just told midnight to "retry" here is my syslog entries for the
entire event:

Any thoughts as to what could cause this?  Faulty driver?  Faulty
motherboard?  Chipset?  Dirty drive?  Any ideas or
fixes/suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thankx
