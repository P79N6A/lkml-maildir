	Hi;
	This is not technically true; once the pktcdvd mapping is made,
the device can be accessed like a r/w block device. For example, after
I associate the dvd with the pktcdvd device, I then can associate it
with a cryptographic loop device, and mke2fs on that, then mount it
and use it like any other filesystem. Something like:
pktsetup dvd /dev/dvd
losetup -e serpent-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/pktcdvd/dvd
mke2fs -m0 /dev/loop0
mount -o noatime,rw /dev/loop0 /mntpoint
	I realize you are differentiating between burning an iso
type image from what cdrwtool does, but I thought I would mention
my usage;) Obviously this would not be compatible with anything
else, which is intentional.
	What is the difference between using cdrwtool on the cd/vd-rw
to form an initial image, and just doing a mkudffs on a pktcdvd
associated device?
