Robert, you should try out rs-throttle-rcu.patch. The idea is that
we don't run too many callbacks in a single rcu. In my setup,
at 100kpps, I see as many as 30000 rcu callbacks in a single
tasklet handler. That is likely hurting even the softirq-only
RCU grace periods. Setting rcupdate.maxbatch=4 will do only 4 per
tasklet thus providing more quiescent points to the system.
Thanks
