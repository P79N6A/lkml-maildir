Hi all,
I have other infos about 3c59x problem.
With kernel 2.0.36 it works very well, my ifconfig doesn't hang and 
doesn't die. With 2.2.0 pre7 it still doesn't work.
I also noticed if I run Xwrapper after ifconfig, Xwrapper hangs and the 
process is marked as D like ifconfig process, then I must reboot the 
system to startup Xwindows.
I think there is a problem either in 3com driver and in net support in 
kernel.
The driver version in 2.0.36 is 0.99E
thanks in advance,
Fausto
