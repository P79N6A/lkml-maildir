I patched your ATA config into my config, built it  and tested it 
with the attached script. More usage info inside script.
$ tstinter start   # creates 2 400MB files
No problems seen, sorry this did not help.
You have no problems with recent 2.4 kernels?
Could you do also lspci -vvxxx using 2.4.22 and see if there is a 
difference?, also stress it with the script if you can.
