Perfect, thanks.
Next.. who knows something about debugging MSI across PCI bridges ?
I've got a 64-bit box here, PCIe near the core, but with full PCI-X
slots on the far side of two bridges.
The kernel happily allows my driver to setup MSI, but the interrupts
never arrive.  So something somewhere in between is either
(1) not set up or quirked quite right, or
(2) one of the bridges won't pass MSI and we don't detect that.
I'll poke more at it later and post some info, if somebody out there
knows enough about this kind of thing to provide some basic hints.
Cheers!
