1. The case that a vma is shared is not likely.
2. Typo fix in mmap.c
3. This may be a bit controversial but it does not seem to
   make sense to use the update_mmu_cache macro when we reuse
   the page. We are only fiddling around with the protections,
   the dirty and accessed bits.
   With the call to update_mmu_cache the way of using the macros
   would be different from mprotect() and page_mkclean(). I'd
   rather have everything work the same way. If this breaks on some
   arches then also mprotect and page_mkclean() are broken.
   The use of mprotect() is rare, we may have breakage in some
   arches that we just have not seen yet.
