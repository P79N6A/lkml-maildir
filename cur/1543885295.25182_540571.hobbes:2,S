Sorry, should have expressed myself more clearly, /dev/rd/0 is the
devfs-style name of the first ram disk device (don't like those devfs
names myself, but since I'm rather new in this group I couldn't convice
my boss to switch to short names yet ;) ). However, its only the
devfs-style of udev and not devfs itself.

Yes, many zeros. Binary files, hexdump and diff are here:

No, no observable corruption.

Need to test this thouroughly, but will do it tomorrow, its too late
here for this kind of tests.

As you can see from my previous reply ;) tested with at least two
different controllers - intel and nvidia (will reboot on the 4th system on Monday to
figure out its hardware, once the corruption happened, the system tend to
stop working).

I also still have problems to believe its a generic problem...
Thanks for your help,
