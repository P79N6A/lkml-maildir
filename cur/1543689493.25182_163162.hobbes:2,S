I've said I want the patch reverted. I still want that, because you
changed way too quickly with too little testing. That does not mean
I'm not going to accept your patches in future. (In fact, my plan is
to  get -test3 version of swsusp back for -test5, then fix up driver
model/swsusp until we have -test3 functionality back, then start
taking your patches). 
Of course, that is going to be easier with your cooperation.
