  I usually export a CD by mounting and exporting that, actually. If you
have the space for the ISO I would think that just copying it from CD to a
hierarchy would take no more space (although if you want to have the ISO
image handy for burning that would take more space).
  Can you export the directory with the ISO image and do a loopback mount
on the client end? haven't tried that, and I'm working on a laptop at the
end of a slow modem this morning, so I'm not able to try it here.
  Oops, I'm wrong, I could ssh into a machine with an NFS directory
containing ISO images, and I did nicely mount one and look at the
contents.
  So to answer your questions, I have no idea why it doesn't work, but you
can get around it if the NFS client is a Linux machine.
  While we're mentioning loopback problems, mounting a CD with loopack and
offset:
  mount -o ro,loop,offset=7480 /dev/cdrom /mnt
used to work and doesn't. I get these CDs all the time with a chunk of
binary data of variable length and an ISO image. Used to work, and I can
mount them on 2.0 and 2.2 systems still. I posted that one before and got
no feedback other than one private E-mail saying that the format was dumb
and I should change it. Since it works for the client and is written by
hardware, LOL.
