I just ran some numbers.  At large packet sizes, it doesn't matter what
options we use, because we spend all of our time in __iowrite_copy32,
which uses the string copy instructions.
For small packets, my quick tests indicate that -Os gives about 5%
*better* performance than -O3 (using gcc 4 on FC4).  This is in line
with what people have been finding in the kernel in general recently.
So if I change that CFLAGS line from -O3 to -Os, are we in OK
shape?  :-)

Good point.  The idstr stuff is for our out-of-tree drivers.
