Huh? My mgetty/sendfax setup did something interesting lately.
I had not finished installing it, and I got a fax. It recieved it into
/tmp, tried moving it to /var/spool/fax/incoming, failed, and left the
tempfile in /tmp. It then mailed me about the recieved fax in /tmp. 
This is EXACTLY the intelligent behaviour that an application writer
can chose for when checking for error codes. Especially "don't unlink
your tempfiles" is easy if you get errors on conversion or copying....
