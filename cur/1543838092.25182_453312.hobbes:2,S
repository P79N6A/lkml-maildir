Indeed.  The rest of the corner cases like netfilter, layered protocol and
so on need to be handled, however they do not need to be handled right now
in order to make remote storage on a lan work properly.  The sane thing for
the immediate future is to flag each socket as safe for remote block IO or
not, then gradually widen the scope of what is safe.  We need to set up an
opt in strategy for network block IO that views such network subsystems as
ipfilter as not safe by default, until somebody puts in the work to make
them safe.
But really, if you expect to run reliable block IO to Zanzibar over an ssh
tunnel through a firewall, then you might also consider taking up bungie
jumping with the cord tied to your neck.

Daniel
