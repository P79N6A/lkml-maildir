Hello
I keep getting these errors when I do "df". It is a IDE disk of 5gb's, and
splitted into two parts. One 2gb /home and one 3gb /export. It's the /export
that gives this error.
Aug  1 14:40:47 astral kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Aug  1 14:40:47 astral kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued!
Aug  1 14:40:47 astral kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
Aug  1 14:40:47 astral kernel: nfs_statfs: statfs error = 111
Can someone tell me what it means and if it is dangerous?
/Jens
