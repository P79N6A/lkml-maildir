Hi Peter,
I just started to try out your SPA scheduler patch and found that it is
noticeably sluggish when resizing a mozilla window on the desktop. I
have a profile of 2.6.7-rc3-spa and 2.6.7-rc2-mm2 and put them up at:
http://zeke.yi.org/linux/spa/
 . There is also vmstat output there but it
doesn't look too helpful to me.
The test was basic and went like this:
x86, K7, UP, gnome desktop with mozilla (with a bunch of tabs) and a few
rxvts. cmdline= elevator=cfq profile=1
readprofile -r
grab a corner of my mozilla window and continually move it around for
several seconds
readprofile -v -m /boot/System.map-2.6.7-rc3|sort -rn +2|head -n30
do the same while dumping vmstat 1 to a file.
The kernel with your patch had a much harder time keeping up with the
window resizing. Moving the entire window did not seem too bad or not
too noticeable. I tried a similar test while running a kernel compile
(make -j3) and it made the window resizing _really_ slow to respond.
Regards,
Shane
