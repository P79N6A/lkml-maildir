It's not broken; just experimental.  I think CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is
accurately describes the status of fs/ext4 as we plan it.  Patches
will be reviewed and tested via quilt series and/or git trees before
they get pushed to fs/ext4, so the expectation isn't that data will be
lost; only that if you want to downgrade to an earlier kernel, and
explicitly enable the latest bleeding edge feature, you might have to
do some work first.  (Which might be dump/reformat/restore, or it
might be "tune2fs -O ^new_feature /dev/sdXX; e2fsck /dev/sdXX" with a
development snapshot of e2fsprogs.)
