Several mistakes: there is no "the real NIC". There may be multiple NICs
(actually quite common nowadays on desktop motherboards, and on laptops
with both wired and wireless interfaces). And one NIC may have several
IP addresses, not just one.

No. Hostname does not have to resolve to _anything_. The hostname is
just a string that identifies the machine for _humans_. It is nothing
more, nothing less. It follows that a hostname should be just as unique
as it's human users are concerned, it has no relation to subnets or
FQDN or any other network term.

You can always configure a dummy interface.
