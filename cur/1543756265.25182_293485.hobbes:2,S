One good thing about the emulator is it is very portable. There is
virtually no stdlib dependency. We can freely move it between user
and kernel space. When integrating the emulator into LinuxBIOS,
we first tried to use it as an user space program and then "port" it
into "kernel" space. The porting was done in a few days and the most
of the time was spent fixing LinuxBIOS itself than doing any "porting".
Actually, the same emulator source were used in both user and kernel
space as a kind of regression test.
