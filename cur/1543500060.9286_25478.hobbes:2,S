Sure sounds that way.  Note that you don't really want truncate()/write()
to be strictly serialized, you just want to serialize things that will
change the length of the file (i.e. truncate and append)  So does the
locking on the inode save us here?
If not, there will be a need for a new lock protecting the length of
the file.  This might also make the simultaneous-writers case that
people were talking about work out better.
