Not really, unfortunately. The CPU certainly runs slower, but the
difference in power consumption between the fastest and slowest speeds
seems to be quite small. The kernel was configured to use APM idle
calls, but no ACPI stuff. I measured the time it took for the battery
to go from 100% to 90% while reading the lkml mailing list with gnus,
so the machine was mostly idle during the test.
How much power savings can be expected in this situation? Is SpeedStep
likely to give more power savings?
