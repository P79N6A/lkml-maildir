I usually test with "apm -s" ... since I've yet to come up with
an ACPI configuration that works properly.  IRQ misconfiguration
for USB is still a blocking issue for many people (not just me).
Going through ACPI would certainly explain some breakage; it's
been sufficiently troublesome with USB that it's not gotten much
testing at all.  I happened to notice this morning that ACPI's
USB IRQ problems are one of the longest-standing open 2.6 bugs:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10
 ... and it's now been
migrated into the 2.4.22-pre series (sigh).
Could you try reproducing this failure using just APM?  I could
believe there's a generic PM issue (I've been expecting 2.6-test
to eventually start shaking PM out); but given the amount of
trouble ACPI has caused, we should first rule that factor out.

I do.  Sharing is irrelevant.  If it's been cleaned up, then
the IRQ should no longer be bound to that device.

I'll have to check that out, but I noticed that one of my
usual development machines (on which suspend/resume can
actually be made to work) is now unusable due to some PCI
initialization issue with Cardbus.

I'll likely submit that to Greg in the next few days, cc you.
