top(1) shows no tasks on sparc64. Large negative inode numbers appear
to be showing up for /proc/stat and other /proc/ special files on
64-bit irrespective of endianness, and all processes appear to have the
same inode number once again irrespective of endianness. It's unclear
why top(1) enumerates tasks on x86-64 and does not do so on sparc64,
unless 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 shows some behavior procps-3.2.3 is sensitive to
that 3.2.1 is not, or some numbers are overflowing on 32-bit apps but
not 64-bit ones (top(1) is 64-bit on x86-64 but 32-bit on sparc64)
that userspace barfs on and not the kernel (no error returns from
syscalls are visible in strace). ls and cat appear to work where top(1)
does not.
