I blame kernel-doc.  It should have a slot for documenting the return value,
but it doesn't, so nobody documents return values.
It should have a slot for documenting caller-provided locking requirements
too.  And for permissible calling-contexts.  They're all part of the
caller-provided environment, and these two tend to be a heck of a lot more
subtle than the function's formal arguments.
