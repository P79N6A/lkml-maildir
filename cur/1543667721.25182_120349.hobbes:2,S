They should be all in the patch-2.5.66-bk1 file on kernel.org right now.

I have a port of this driver in my kernel tree, if you really want to
use it right now.  But I'd recommend waiting on converting the chip
drivers until we get the sysfs interface conversion done, otherwise we
will have to go back and modify all files again :)
See my other post about the eeprom.c driver for more info on the sysfs
changes needed for i2c chip drivers, it isn't as simple.
But if you really want to do it, great.  Send it on to lkml, and
probably the sensors list.  You can cc me if you want to.
thanks,
