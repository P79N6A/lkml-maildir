hello again,
made an interesting discovery. i'm willing to bet that pppd is still
unstable as hell, *but*, i've been able to work around the problems with
ifconfig locking up the box or causing oopses by using the iproute
utils. good incentive to work exclusively with those tools, at least for
now ;).
again, please CC: me.
eric
