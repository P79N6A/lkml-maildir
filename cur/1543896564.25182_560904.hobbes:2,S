And then, I did that a number of times in the other recent long
thread, whenever I made statements that could be construed as FSF's
opinion.  Now, this time I missed it, added the clarification just in
case, and you pick on me.  Puhlease!

How does that make me an FSF Board Member, as you claimed at first?
Yes, I'm a co-founder of an independent organization that, for sharing
the same goals as other FSFs, was welcomed into the global network of
FSFes.
That we have the same goals does not imply I'm in any way associated
with the FSF.  Your faulty assumption and your attempts to paper over
your mistake won't make it true.

Indeed, compiler engineers are often the bearers of company's voices.
Not!

Understood.  Thanks for doing that so nicely.
I'm glad it's clear now.
