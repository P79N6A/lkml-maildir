If I correctly remember the days when I used NeXTSTEP, there were two boot 
modes.  In graphics mode, there was a status bar.  In verbose (text) mode, 
all the messages appeared.  As the boot started, there was a prompt in 
which you could specify single-user mode, verbose mode, etc.  With no 
specification, after a few seconds it would go ahead and boot.  Also, the 
mode (graphics vs text) could be set via the Preferences capability.
As a software developer, most of the time I didn't want/need the messages 
so I'd let it run in graphics mode.  Of course when the boot had a problem, 
I'd reboot and run it verbose (text) mode.
