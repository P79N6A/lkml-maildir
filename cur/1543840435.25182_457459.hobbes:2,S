One day when I feel in the right mode I will try to cook up something
so you can get a menu where you can change the individual items referend for
a symbol.
This should allow you to say N to all selected symbols except the symbols
that is selected where you have to take one step deeper in the hirachy.
But there are more exiting project ahead than just this one so...
