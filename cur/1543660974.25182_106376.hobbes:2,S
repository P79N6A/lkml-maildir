To the farthest of my knowledge, the LPP is just an add-on to the fbdev's
(fake, ahem) capability of showing a picture at startup. But if you say it
worked for you, I'd be eager to trying out your patch. Only question: what
are you referring to with "-4"? Release 4 of your distro's 2.4.18 kernel?
2.4.18-pre4?
