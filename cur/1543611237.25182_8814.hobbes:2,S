I'll need to go back and review the changes to the char and block 
devices.  I believe that a big chunk of the drivers that we changed were 
misc drivers, so I might still be in luck.
Does everyone agree that we need to get the BKL out of common areas like 
this?  For starters, what about adding a pair of spinlocks for block 
devices and character devices to take the place of the BKL in 
serializing opens?  Or, should we make it the driver's responsibility 
completely?
