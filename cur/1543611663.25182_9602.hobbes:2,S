Beware of scripts that claim to fix the /etc/hosts file. (Mandrake 8.1 cups 
script[confirmed], among other possibilites. one ugly sol'n is to make 
/etc/hosts immutable [chattr +i /etc/hosts]. Risky, and needs to be root to 
do it. But immutable stops even root from modifying the file. Of course, do 
this after fixing it. Also, try fixing it so it is a real domain name. like 
astinusgod.pt [or whatever u hope to have as your domain name someday])
I used to have this problem too w/ Mandrake.
