No one is asking you to 'care' about our problems running a notebook with a 
closed source driver under ndiswrapper.  We aren't asking you to debug 
problems with them either.  All we're asking is for you to not go out of your 
way to break existing working machines, and make it difficult to run Linux on 
them.  You are talking about knowingly removing an option that allows many 
machines to currently run without problems, some of them for reasons other 
than closed source code.
If you want 4k stacks to be the default, I have no problem with that.  If you 
want to rip out the provision for 8k stacks to be selectable at build time, 
that is a different issue entirely.
