None of the new chips (r300, any nvidia, matrox, etc) has opensource 3D
drivers. 
If you want good 3D support (OpenGL) you need to use binary drivers :(
DRI (opensource) opengl-drivers have support for only ati r200 and older
cards.. so nothing new. And DRI drivers don't support the advanced features
of these cards.. so no shaders etc :(
OpenGL support in DRI drivers feels also more buggy than Nvidia/ATI binary
drivers :(
So the situation is not good..
