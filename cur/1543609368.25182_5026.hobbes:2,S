You've got the same problem I have. There is something weird with the way 
some laptops (and LCD based desktops) handle this display, and the only way 
I've gotten around it is to use the VesaFB driver (which is heaps slower 
than the accelerated driver), and then either use the FB driver for X 
(which is buggy IMHO, crashes if it gets too much to do buffered up), or 
disable the mode changes and use the SiS accelerated X driver.
Alan has new drivers in his ac tree. but I've tried them, and no luck. Give 
them a shot and see how you go. You might be lucky.
Out of interest, what model/manufacturer is the notebook? The machines I'm 
having problems with are Clevo LP200S's, which is an upright LCD machine, 
with the h/drive and power supply down in the stand/foot.
Once we get everything working with Linux, they'll suit the application we 
have for them rather nicely. *sigh*
Q: Slightly related, have you gotten the sound to work? Driver loads, I get 
"Unknown Codec" and an empty codec value. Reloading the driver makes no 
difference (even numerous times). Wondering if your system is the same...
