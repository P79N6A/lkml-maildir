Thanks.

SuSE is being annoying in a way Red Hat wasn't.  The box has a 2.4.6
kernel on it, I'll probably upgrade that before pursuing this much further
(which I won't be in a position to do until I physically get back to
Austin...)  Since I've been playing with Linux From Scratch recently, I 
ight throw the system I've put together on there so I at least know what
the heck it's all doing. :)
What kind of packets are keepalive packets, by the way?  (I don't think
the firewall rules are filtering them out, but I can't be sure.)
