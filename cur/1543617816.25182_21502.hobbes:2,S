Macros to use kdev_t also changed.

|
|   #define MINOR(dev)  ((unsigned int) ((dev) & MINORMASK))
|
|   Then usage of the MINOR() macro remains unchanged.
Nope, use major() and minor() instead [although I prefer
the kmajor() and kminor() patch].
See 
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/linux-port-25x.html,
item 7, bullet 3, which points to an email from one Linus Torvalds
about the kdev_t change.
