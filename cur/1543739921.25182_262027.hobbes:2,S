Greetings,
Not myself but someone else had this issue while compiling on an amd64 
system.

I checked the 2.6.9 tree and the file does appear to be missing.  Thanks 
ahead of time for any assistance in the matter.  Feel free to rough me 
up a bit if I'm sending out a duplicate issue, but I didn't quite see 
anything of this sort while searching throught the rather lengthy 30,000 
or so archived messages I have :).
