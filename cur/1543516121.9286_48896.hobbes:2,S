But wrong.  The ITT XTRA MS-DOS 2.11 Reference had a chapter on Xenix 
compatibility which explained this stuff in detail; I've never seen it in 
other DOS manuals.
CP/M, and therefore DOS 1.x, used / to signal parameters --- and the CLI 
knew about this, such that "FOO/X" would be parsed as a command "FOO" with 
an argument "/X".  To maintain compatibility with DOS 1.x while providing an 
upgrade path to Xenix compatibility, the SWITCHAR could be set via a DOS 
call or CONFIG.SYS; if set to anything but "/", "Xenix-like" command parsing 
was used and DOS commands could be invoked with switches preceded by the 
specified SWITCHAR; 3rd party DOS programs were supposed to use another DOS 
call to get the SWITCHAR and use it appropriately.  ("Xenix-like command 
parsing" meaning that "FOO-X" was not treated as command "FOO" with switch 
"-X" if the SWITCHAR was "-".)  There was also AVAILDEV which, if set to NO, 
disabled "bare" device references such as "CON", and you had to use 
"\DEV\CON" or "/DEV/CON" instead; all the standard DOS 2.11 programs used 
the \DEV prefix internally so they would work with AVAILDEV=NO, and again 
3rd party programs were supposed to query AVAILDEV and behave appropriately.
That chapter also stated that DOS 3.x would default to a SWITCHAR of "-" and 
would add limited multitasking features, and that DOS would gradually be 
migrated to full Xenix compatibility, followed by its being fully replaced 
by Xenix (!).  I sometimes wonder what the computing world would be like if 
Microsoft had actually done this....

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
