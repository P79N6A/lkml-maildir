I would include support for new chipsets in with bugfixes.

If nobody tests 2.5.x on a specific piece of hardware, 2.6.0 will be
released without being tested on that piece of hardware.
Incrementing the version number from 2.5.$bignum to 2.6.0 does _not_
magically fix all the bugs in it.

Production systems should be backed up.  No question about that.
Unless the system has to run 24/7, which a desktop machine usually
doesn't have to, I don't see why testing 2.5 on it isn't a
possibility.
