Gods, no.  I believe it is always a bug for drivers to call yield()
in 2.6.  What is probably meant here is cond_resched().  I'd support
deleting the EXPORT_SYMBOL(yield) line and fixing the breakage afterwards
as it causes lots of very subtle breakage ("Under certain circumstances,
Linux just stops doing anything for 5 seconds").
