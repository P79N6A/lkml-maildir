Huang - what has become of this patchset?
We (SGI) have designs on a big honkin NUMA box using x86_64 arch, and
we are runnning up against the arbitrary limits on the memory map size
due to the ancient 4k zero page size limit (hence H. Peter Anvin added
to the CC list, since he knows a bazillion times more about any such
limits than I do.).  The limits on 128 or so local chunks of memory
imposed by the kernel code that invokes Int 15 E820h are too small for
us.
Since we are already accustomed to dealing with EFI on our IA64
Itanium boxes, I'm figuring that it will be easier in the short run,
and better in the long run, to just use EFI on these upcoming big
x86_64 NUMA boxes.
But we'd need to get this patch, or something equivalent, into the
Linux kernel in the next 2.6.* cycle or so, for this to work for us.
Also, is there a current version of this patch set available, against
either 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 or Ingo's recent x86 git tree?  I should try it
out.
