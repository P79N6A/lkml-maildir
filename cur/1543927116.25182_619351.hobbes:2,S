James preference seem to go for a revert of the patch that removed the
kmalloc of the buffer instead. Sounds definitely like an easier plan
for .24 (and maybe even backport to stable).
I'll produce a patch for that later today or tomorrow.
Do you still think we should introduce this __dma_cacheline_aligned ? Do
you see other cases of drivers where it would be useful ? It tend to
agree with your earlier statement that drivers doing that are broken and
should be using a separate allocator for DMA'ble objects (in fact, on
non-cache coherent archs, kmalloc is just fine).
Cheers,
Ben.
