AT LAST I HAVE SOME DATA!!!
The problem is that ALL SYSTEM CALLS to open "/dev/tty" are blocking!! even
with O_NDELAY set and even from completely disjoint sessions.  I discovered
this via issuing "strace sh".  That's why the new xterm windows froze.
The original process doing the open("/dev/ttyS1", O_RDWR) is listed in the
ps aux listing as status S+.
Hope this helps.... karl m
