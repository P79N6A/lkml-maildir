True, and that's roughly what I do now (except just with elevated priority as 
opposed to a realtime scheduler policy).  However, it's more friendly to the 
system if the realtime priority is limited to just the thread that needs it, 
and that's why the application itself needs to provide the hint.
Zinf already does try to provide such a hint by setting a higher priority for 
its sound servicing thread.  Unfortunately, this is ignored unless zinf is 
running as root.  Given the number of bugs in Zinf, I am uncomfortable 
running the whole application as root.  It's altogether more conservative to 
limit the risk to a single, simple thread that can be easily audited.

I agree it's the more important problem, but there are also more people 
already working on it, whereas over here in the audio corner, there are just 
Davide and me (sorry if I left anyone out, please feel free to flame me so I 
know who you are).

I never tried audio until 2.5.73.  With Con's patches, life has been pretty 
good for me from then on, from the non-starvation point of view.

In case anybody wants to hearken back to the good old days of 2.4, forget it. 
It is only good for sound if you are lucky enough to have a configuration it 
likes.  My unlucky wife on the other hand, who gets by with a 233 MHz K6 
(because she can) is running 2.4 and says sound skips whenever she does 
anything with the machine other that just letting it sit and play.  Now that 
I think of it, this will be an ideal machine for testing audio robustness, 
and scheduler robustness in general.
