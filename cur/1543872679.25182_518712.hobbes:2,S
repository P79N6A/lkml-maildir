Hmmmm....

IRQ 16 is IO-APIC-fasteoi for libata, and is not shared... but all the
others libata IRQ are IO-APIC-edge.

Tried that.. Disk is identified as ATA-7: Mastor 6Y080L0, YAR41BW0, max
UDMA/13
and then timeout again...
Tried then with acpi=off, same result (identify is OK, but then timeout),
and irqpoll and then it was OK !!!!
Let's then go back to my DVD-RW and test irqpoll...
and ... Yes.... Got it !
It is identified, it can be mounted, and read as /dev/sr1 !
/proc/interrupts show a count of 0 for IRQ 16, so yes, it goes somewhere
else...
Doing some diffs on copy of /proc/interrupts while accessing the DVD
gives two possibilities : IRQ14 or IRQ18, but both are also counting
when not accessing the DVD...
Question : does running with irqpoll affects performance ?
