No, it is obsolete because we have more than one driver for this 
hardware, and the people responsible for network drivers in the kernel 
decided some time ago that sk98lin is the one that is obsolete.

A better written driver might still lack some workarounds for broken 
hardware or similar problems. Or simply contain some bugs like all 
software does.
The important word is not "reliability", it's "maintainability".
And that's something that pays off in the long term.

It was clear that sk98lin would go in the long term, and the only thing 
that could be discussed is the when and how of removal.
When you talk about "new information", why did this information not 
surface until after the sk98lin driver was removed?
Is there really a problem with "the timing of removal" or would we have 
faced exactly the same problems if the removal was timed a year later?
And this is really the essence when I'm saying "removing code improves 
the kernel": The goal is to get people to report if the new drivers 
aren't usefully stable for them, not to use sk98lin instead without 
sending a bug report.
Having different drivers with different sets of bugs and features is 
not a situation that should be retained for a longer time.
The underlying question is:
Is there anything better than a quick removal of the obsolete driver to 
get people to both test and report bugs with the new driver?
Keeping obsolete drivers longer only for running into exactly the same 
problem later isn't an improvement.
