Yes.  Maybe crashme as well; has anyone run it on
recent kernels?
Speaking of crashme, is there a filesystem version of it?
It would go something like this:
  for (;;)
    p = random filesystem operation (read,write,seek,mkdir,etc)
    perform p on the real victim filesystem
    perform p on an internal model of VFS semantics
    compare; if different, complain
The file contents could be deterministically-random
junk so that the internal model needs only metadata state.
Run several concurrently to test a local filesystem,
or perhaps bang on an NFS server from many directions.
