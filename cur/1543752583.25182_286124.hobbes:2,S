I believe so.  You may also need to cast them as volatile to prevent the 
compiler from reordering--can someone with more gcc knowledge than I 
state definitively whether or not it is smart enough to not reorder 
barriers?

As above.
You may also need a read barrier to ensure that they are not 
speculatively loaded in the wrong order--could someone more knowledgable 
than I comment on that?

I believe the spinlock implies it.

Not stupid.  Concurrency is hard.
