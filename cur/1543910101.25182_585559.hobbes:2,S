I wonder if this'll generate smaller and better code than _both_ the
other atomic_read_volatile() variants. Would need to build allyesconfig
on lots of diff arch's etc to test the theory though.

True ...

Code that looks like:
	while (!atomic_read(&v)) {
		...
		cpu_relax_no_barrier();
		forget(v.counter);
		        ^^^^^^^^
	}
would be uglier. Also think about code such as:
	a = atomic_read();
	if (!a)
		do_something();
	forget();
	a = atomic_read();
	... /* some code that depends on value of a, obviously */
	forget();
	a = atomic_read();
	...
So much explicit sprinkling of "forget()" looks ugly.
	atomic_read_volatile()
on the other hand, looks neater. The "_volatile()" suffix makes it also
no less explicit than an explicit barrier-like macro that this primitive
is something "special", for code clarity purposes.

forget(x) is just a stupid-placeholder-for-a-better-name. order(x) sounds
good but we could leave quibbling about function or macro names for later,
this thread is noisy as it is :-)
