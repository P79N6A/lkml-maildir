I had not *explictly* disabled it, since as the doc suggests :
        vt.default_utf8=
                        [VT]
                        Format=<0|1>
                        Set system-wide default UTF-8 mode for all tty's.
                        Default is 1, i.e. UTF-8 mode is enabled for all
                        newly opened terminals.
And I know that I can fix the behaviour by explicitly setting it to zero.
Also, the fact that "od" shows me multi-byte characters on the input
indicates to me that everything is set to UTF-8. So unless I'm missing
something, my console is set by default to UTF-8 (I test this on 2.6.25).
