Hello,
I got the same here. My computer (UP pentium 100 with 32 meg ram) froze this
morning, i was not doing stresstesting at all, the machine was verry lightly or not
loaded.
The kernel i used before was test8-riel2-blk3, which never had such lockups. (so
the bug has creeped in verry recently i guess)
Greets,
Frank Dekervel
