hello,
	as I mentioned yesterday here is draft 4 of the
press release.  As I said, this is the last version I
will be doing. It's not that it can't be improved further,
(we all know it can), but I'm a little out of my depth
now, so maybe someone who's not as techie (or geeky)
could enhance it further.
cheers

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
LINUX KERNEL 2.2
Santa Clara CA, January XX, 1999
Today the Linux software development team, led by Linus Torvalds, released a
major new version of the the Linux operating system. This update brings
advanced 
scalability, broad support for newer hardware, and a large collection of 
low-level features.
Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and WAN support, which gives Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
  usage limits, accounting, and virtual private networks. Strong
  256-bit encryption is available as an add-on component.
* With Y2K compliance, and new Euro support, Linux 2.2.0 is ready
  for the next millenium.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, complete with data
  replication for performance, mobility, and reliability.
* Video capture support, TV tuner support, enhanced audio support,
  and other multimedia enhancements.
* Support for a large variety of parallel port devices including
  disk drives, tape drives, and other easy-to-use external devices.
* The already legendary linux performance is significantly enhanced.
  High end SMP scaling gives good performance on 12 processor 
  machines. Linux 2.2 supports up to 64 processor systems.
* Compatibility support for reading BSD and NT filesystems. Easy 
  access to documents stored on NTFS-format disks will facilitate 
  the upgrade from legacy NT systems to Linux.
Advanced technical users are already using this update, available
from the Internet. Linux vendors will begin shipping fully integrated 
systems using the new kernel in March.  Business users will be 
able to obtain the update on CD-ROM distributions.
Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware 
or give new life to older 386 and 486 based computers. Several other 
processors, including the 64-bit Alpha and UltraSPARC are also 
supported. Support is widely available via both traditional contracts 
and cost-effective Internet groups. Linux is provided under an 
unlimited-use license that lets users make in-house customizations 
to the system itself. Initial estimates suggest that Linux has up to
20 million users worldwide.
According to Cohen and Valloppillil of Microsoft, Linux "poses a direct,
short-term revenue and platform threat to Microsoft, particularly in
server space. Additionally, the intrinsic parallelism and free idea
exchange [of Linux] has benefits that are not replicable with our
current licensing model." They also note that "Linux has been deployed
in mission critical, commercial environments with an excellent pool of
public testimonials."
Valloppillil has been impressed with the quality of Linux, and the open
source model it was developed under, stating "Linux represents a 
best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission critical applications, 
and - due to it's open source code - has a long term credibility which 
exceeds many other competitive OS's."
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara CA, USA. He and others created Linux as an alternative to
proprietry operating systems after becoming disillusioned with the
poor quality of commercial alternatives.
