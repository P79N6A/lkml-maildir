This should be "if (timeout_msecs)", a negative timeout means
"wait indefinitely", so we should restart as well.

and, in that case, we should use "(u64)timeout_jiffies >> 32".
Small nit: sys_poll() and do_restart_poll() are not "symmetrical", the latter
doesn't check *timeout at all. Either way is correct, restart with zero timeout
means "try again once but doesn't wait".
There is a subtle (but harmless) difference though. Suppose that *timeout == 0
(either because timeout_msecs == 0 or because timeout expiried) and we have a
"false" signal_pending(). In that case sys_poll() returns EINTR, but do_restart_poll()
returns 0.
I was a bit surprized that sys_poll() return EINTR even if timeout expired, but
preserved this behaviour in do_poll-return-eintr-when-signalled.patch.
Perhaps it is better to just remove "if (timeout_msecs > 0)" check from sys_poll().
Then we can modify do_poll() to return EINTR only when !*timeout, to eliminate
unneeded (but correct) restart.
What do you think?
Oleg.
