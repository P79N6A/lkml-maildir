Well, ok, but the alternatives are ACPI, which has always been spotty,
and two competing power management schemes from Patrick and Pavel,
neither of which seem to actually work yet.  Wouldn't it be nice to
have at least one working method of putting a laptop to sleep?
Once I get some free time (maybe next week, who knows) I'll try
backing out bits of the -test8 patch to see what broke.  In the
meantime, -test7 works great.
