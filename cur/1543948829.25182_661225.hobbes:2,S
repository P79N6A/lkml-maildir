Sentiment granted, but I'm not sure it can be an issue.  It *could* be
in issue if we moved to a more flexible access control here here any
netns could access the .netns/N directories for all it's child
namespaces.
But it can't, and /proc/net is set by the kernel.  So the <id> can't be
an issue for any checkpoint/restart except htat of the whole system, and
of course on whole-system resume we have no <id> collision worries.
So userspace can't do anything with <id>, so there is no reason to worry
about it becoming another namespace?
Right?
