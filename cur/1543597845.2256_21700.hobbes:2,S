FWIW (qualitative data point), my EPoX system with the VIA chipset seems to run a
few *hours* without an oops when I boot a PIII kernel and run it with X, but a few
*days* on the same kernel when I don't start X.
Sometimes it barfs early even without X, but there seems to be a significant
difference in the expected uptime between using X and not using X.
