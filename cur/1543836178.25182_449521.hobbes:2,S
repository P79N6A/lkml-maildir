Killing it might be the right thing to do, but someone should double
check against omap 1510 errata ... on first principles that should be
either a workaround for a very old erratum, or else a bug that's been
sitting around for a long time.  (Possibly making one of your other
points!)  The earliest versions of that driver were pretty crappy,
and I could imagine that mechanism was left unchanged since, unlike
a lot of stuf you didn't see, this wasn't actively buggy.

The relation is that they'd both be per-board mechanisms that
belong better with platform data.  (Unless of course setting that
one address is not really needed.)

Well for the record that's not been reported as a problem ... that is,
nobody's reported a board where that matters.  We'd have to see if the
driver is even usable without that, since the I2C stack overall seemed
to require probing to work.
(There's a separate issue about how the I2C stack doesn't just have a
mechanism to just declare "this board has these chips, these addresses",
so I2C drivers have needless reliance on probing...)

The spec does say it's tested for zero after decrementing the count,
so a value of zero gives a 65536 byte transfer.

Good.  Komal, please update the comment accordingly ... it'd be
handy if kerneldoc or Documentation/i2c/* said that adap->retries
is optional, and said what it's supposed to do.

My main concern was that the process had stalled, for an essential
driver.  It's not stalled any more, assuming Komal makes time to
address those comments!
