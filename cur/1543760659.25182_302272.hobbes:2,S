Of course I am not an expert here, but I want to rule out some trivial 
userspace things first.
Some time ago Greg KH said that even when the modprobe command returns, there 
is no guarantee that the module finished hardware detection. By rebuilding 
ata_piix as a non-module, you changed the timeline.
Could you please, for debugging, recompile ata_piix as a module again, but add 
a "sleep 5" before the mkrootdev command? If that works, a bug (race) is 
officially in userspace.
Sorry if all of the above is in fact just meaningless noise.
