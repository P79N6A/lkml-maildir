I am suffering complete freezes on my system with a Promise TX2
controller tring to talk to a ST3160023AS drive. It works fine for
hours or days at a time, but will occasionally log an error of "ata1:
command timeout", then freeze within a minute, such that alt-SysRq-b
doesn't work.
This seems to happen more often when the drive is in heavy use. I
do not know a way to trigger it specifically.
Kernel: 2.6.10-rc2, unpatched
Hardware:
Athlon 950
Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. PDC20375 (SATA150 TX2plus) (rev 2)
ST3160023AS
Hauppauge WinTV performing constant video capture (don't know if PCI saturation could contribute to this problem)
Last log entries (logged via netconsole):
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program, like XFree86, might be trying access hardware directly.
scsi: unknown opcode 0x04
scsi: unknown opcode 0x2a
scsi: unknown opcode 0x35
scsi: unknown opcode 0x5b
scsi: unknown opcode 0x1e
ata1: command timeout
I hope this is enough information to be useful. Thanks to Jeff Garzik
for all his work on SATA...
