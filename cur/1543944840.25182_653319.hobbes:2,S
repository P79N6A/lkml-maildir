This is what I was using purely for test builds ... most x86 hardware
actually has no GPIOs, and I sure don't have any of the "unusual" x86
platforms here, so I'd not want to see this version merge.  Someone
more clued in on how x86 handles what ARM does with e.g. <asm/arch/...>
should make a better patch.
(And my vote is to **NOT** use the "-I..." magic that PowerPC uses,
that's just confusing as all get-out.  And not needed.)

That could be added eventually ... if the platform has GPIO support
it could include the <asm/gpio.h> else it could define all the calls
as error-returning inlines.

========= CUT HERE
DEBUG ONLY -- make X86_PC use gpiolib.
It's not clear to me how the various x86-ish platforms should
be made to work here, since there seems to be no convention
that each platform type has its own <asm/arch/...> subdir.
