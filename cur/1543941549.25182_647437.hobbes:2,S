i dont get it - please give me specific technological reasons why on my 
PC /dev/rtc couldnt be mapped to /dev/rtc0 - without requiring any 
user-space changes. The APIs seem mostly covered, or at least mappable. 
Why should the transition to a new driver require user-level changes? 
(beyond the obvious extensions, but those should show up as extensions.) 
In fact i detest the old RTC code with a vengence, so dont understand 
this as some invitation to flame or something - i simply want YOUR new 
code to be utilized more! I just dont see the specific technological 
reasons of why there is no .config switch to switch the legacy /dev/rtc 
over to the new RTC driver and be done with it. I'd enable it in a 
heartbeat and would encourage distros to do so. Are there missing APIs? 
Is the ioctl API totally different? It's impossible to wrap it? I'm not 
really interested in "this isnt a PC" arguments. The incompatibility is 
such an obvious migration barrier to me - do you really not see it?
