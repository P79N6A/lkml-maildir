another thing is that you could also simply override the mmap symbol from
glibc do transparently use hugetlb pages.
Another problem with this interface is that hugetlb_zero_setup bypassed
directory based permissions, aka it's has the same design bug as the
broken sysv shm extension for hugetlb pages and thus needs privilegues
or one of the horrible hacks discussed on lkml the last days.
