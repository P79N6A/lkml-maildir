The difference is the Ethernet CRC goes at the end of the frame
(designed for insertion by hardware), but the TCP/UDP data checksums go
_before_ the data.
So hardware has to buffer an entire frame before it can insert the
TCP/UDP checksum.  As most (if not all) network drivers do load the
entire frame onto the card before beginning transmission, this is a
possibility.
