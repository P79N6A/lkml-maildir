That's right.  I thought you guys had something that would handle that
early on, but looking at how the trick works in the vmlinux.lds.S ia64
uses that isn't the case.
I guess we really can't do per-cpu accesses early on.
This is extremely fragile, we should find some way to formalize this
to make accidental early per-cpu references trap at build time or
similar.
