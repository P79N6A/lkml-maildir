Hello,
we just implemented the Intel PIIX DMA Bus Master capable IDE Controller
in FAUmachine. This improved the IO access to virtual IDE Devices using
DMA as transport mechanism a lot.
But with the current simulation it is only possible to access 4 devices
via DMA.
Because of that I am looking for a good documented PCI IDE Controller
Card to provide DMA access to more than 4 devices with public available
documentation. Any pointers?
Please CC me because I am currently not subscribed to linux-kernel.
	Thomas
