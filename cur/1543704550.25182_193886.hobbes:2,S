I've finally found the problem. It was a *hardware* problem.
The problem occured only with DMA activated for harddisks and the
Knoppix kernel doesn't do this by default.
(It was a bit strange, because it happend only when writing to disk
while having high network traffic, even after switching NIC and IDE
controler.)
I've exchanged the mainboard and now everything is working perfectly.
Sorry for wasting your time, folks.
