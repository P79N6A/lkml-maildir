The switch to using the swsusp lowlevel code was a bit bumpy, and I do admit 
that I broke swsusp from time to time, but these are the exceptions (as you 
say), and the general design is such that they should be coexist. I'll freely 
admit that I don't regularly test swsusp, but I'm also not reguarly changing 
things that should break it.

Did you report them to the list? I try to be responsive (although, again, I 
don't always succeed to the extent that I'd like.

Yeah, being much simpler does have its advantages, and Rafael has done a good 
job with the uswsusp code. Hopefully I'll get to test it properly soon.
