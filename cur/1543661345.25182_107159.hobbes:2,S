If it's an Intel CPU (not pentium 4) this should be OK
For Athlon, use INST_RETIRED

Run a few kernel compiles and stress it a bit. Run "op_time" to check
you get output...

I haven't seen where you added these checks. They did not exist before:
oprofile took responsibility for the NMI/perfctr handling off the NMI
watchdog entirely, then handed it back when oprofile finished.
Basically you have to ensure that only the right pm callback is called,
not both.
