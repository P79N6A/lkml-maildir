I'm working on this right now.  My plan is as follows:
- Use a C parser which takes .c or .i files and searches for the format 
parameter to every printk call.
- Provide that information to both a preprocessor and the printk function.
- Pipe every .c or .i file through an intermediate preprocessor before 
or after going to cpp but before the compiler.
- Do automatic string replacement.
Right now, I'm hovering somewhere around 40% compression on the text. 
 When I have better results, I will write up a full report and post it 
on lkml.
And, BTW, I will ONLY be supporting English.  As far as I am concerned, 
the internationalization is an concluded issue.  There's no benefit to 
it, and Linus won't accept it into mainline anyhow.
