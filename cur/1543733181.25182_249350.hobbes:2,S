Hey, please refute my "you need 20% free" to get even to order-3 for most
cases first.
It's probably acceptable to have a _very_ backgrounded job that does
freeing if order-3 isn't available, but it had better be pretty
slow-moving, I suspect. On the order of "It's probably ok to try to aim
for up to 25% free 'overnight' if the machine is idle" but it's almost
certainly not ok to aggressively push things out to that degree..
