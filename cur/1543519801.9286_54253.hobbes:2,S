It was NOT ability to do "rmdir ." for sure :-)

Hmm. Inconsistency started from linux kernel 2.2 :-) With linux kernel 2.0
"rmdir" and "rm -rf" were consistent: both were unable to remove `.' or `..'
In case of "rmdir" it was limitation of kernel while "rm -rf" had special
check (there was no need for special check in rmdir since rmdir will not do
anything destructive before trying to remove `.' or `..'). In linux kernel 2.2
you can remove `.' and/or `..' (you can remove `..' only when `..' is empty,
of course; this mean that `.' must be already removed :-) and now "rmdir" and
"rm -rf" behaviour are inconsistent. Since Linus said that it's Ok to rmdir(".")
now it's task for FSF to make "rmdir" and "rm -rf" consistent again (by removing
check from "rm -rf" or by adding it to "rmdir").
