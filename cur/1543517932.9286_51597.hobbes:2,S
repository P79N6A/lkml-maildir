     I am sure that's not the issue.  The reason I say this is that SunOS 4.1.4
will run for months without a crash on the same hardware.
     My main shell server here is a SunOS 4.1.4 machine on the same hardware
except that it's also got a FDDI card in the box generating additional heat and
if I don't have to boot it for some other reason it will generally go about six
weeks between crashes. 
     For what it may or may not be worth, I don't have drives in this box so
there isn't that source of heat, just the CPU's, memory, etc.
