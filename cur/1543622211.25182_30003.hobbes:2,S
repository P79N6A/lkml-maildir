As I was plumbing in a sink ;-) the thought also occurred that you could 
have allocate
and free counters per cpu. The fix up code could do leveling between 
them. Are you
sure you only want to look at the actual value infrequently though? 
Every time you
put a page into delalloc state you need to do something similar to 
balance_dirty(),
if you only poll the value periodically then it could get way out of 
balance before
you noticed. It is very easy to dirty memory this way, cat /dev/zero > 
xxxx runs
very quickly.
I would almost say you need to get a 'reservation' of a delalloc page 
before you
grab the memory. There are extra memory costs associated with getting the
page out of this state, and if you do not hold threads back from 
dirtying pages
you can end up in a situation where you cannot clean up again.
