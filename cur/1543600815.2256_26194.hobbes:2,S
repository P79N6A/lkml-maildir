Since upgrading to 2.4.10-pre7, accessing my Win2000 ntfs partition (mounted
read-only) causes a lockup.  There are no oops messages on the console or in the
logs; if I'm in text mode when it happens the system still responds to <alt-f1>
etc. and to <alt-sysrq> but not to anything else.  If I'm in X nether the mouse
nor the keyboard respond.  This is on a ThinkPad 600X with a kernel compiled
with egcs-2.91.66.  The last kernel that worked correctly for me was
2.4.10-pre4.  I skipped -pre5; -pre6 (with Anton's one-line patch applied to
allow compiling with egcs-2.91.66) gives the same lockup as -pre7.
