That is usually a mistake. People get the more subtle issues
like long long handling wrong, and then it is impossible to fix it 
anymore in a compat layer (examples are ipsec and iptables, which
cannot be emulated on x86-64 because of that) 
So please never pass any structures with read/write/netlink.
Thank you.
