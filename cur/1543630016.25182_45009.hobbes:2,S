Ok, I'm assuming that there are no boxes with no ISA slots but VLB slots.
I guess that's safe. If someone really has a weird box were that is not true
I guess they'll have to live with defining CONFIG_ISA. 
In theory one could introduce an CONFIG_VLB, but I don't think it is 
worth it.

Ok thanks, will change it.
