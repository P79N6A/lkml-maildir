Hi gentlemen!
I did already post this but the things have not changed. Does somebody care
to eliminate these bootup messages?
=== Cut ===
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
change_root: old root has d_count=5
Trying to unmount old root ... <3>error -16
Change root to /initrd: error -2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 60k freed
=== Cut ===
This is from 2.2.1-ac5. The plain vanilla 2.2.1 behaves in exactly the same
manner...
