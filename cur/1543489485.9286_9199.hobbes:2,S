Every time I play an mp3 off an ntfs partition, I get lots and lots of 
messages similar to these:
Mar 10 09:00:22 blowfish kernel: bmap of 6bb,block bf is a9e2e 
Mar 10 09:00:22 blowfish kernel: super 400 
This seems to be coming from ntfs_bmap() in fs/ntfs/fs.c.  Anyone know 
what's going on here?
