It does not. That's the whole point: the (functionally redundant) =0 wastes
another sizeof(int) bytes in the kernel image.

If you want to document your code like this, put it in a comment. That's what
they are there for. Or, if coding a function which explicitly relies on a
variable being 0, have that function set the variable to zero.

Which is silly. The variable is explicitly defined to be zero anyway, whether
you put this in your code or not.

Just put:
static int a; /* must be set to zero in foobar() */

Unfortunately, this handy documentation shortcut of yours bloats the kernel
unnecessarily.

It does NOT generate the same code - that's the point. It generates smaller but
functionally equivalent code. The first version zeroes a TWICE, in effect; this
is completely unnecessary, and just bloats the kernel.

Oh no! You mean you might actually have to look at the code you're changing?!
This is hardly a valid reason for bloating the kernel! If you put the "this
variable must be zero when foo() is called" in a comment, rather than as a C
statement, it is equally clear to you - but avoids bloating the kernel.

So put that comment in a real comment, rather than a redundant statement!
