Right now I'm compiling for the -rt kernel without my updates, to see if
it is reproducible there.  It is reproducible with my customizations.  One
thing that my kernel does is take the CPU from all other processes
(including tasklet threads) for long periods of time.  I'll see if I can
trigger this with the hackbench of highest priority on -rt, which does the
same thing.
