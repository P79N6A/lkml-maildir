I now removed several things from my test6 kernel:
- CardBus/PCMCIA support
- Networking support
- Mouse support
- Sound support
- Parallel port support
- USB
- AGP
- Framebuffer support and all other graphics support except 
  vga console
- IDE CDROM and floppy disk Support
- ISA bus support
- P'n'P support
and maybe some more things I forgot now
However, no change (except I get lots of errors from services while 
booting) - it freezes after the hard disk is shut down.
Any other ideas?
Michael
