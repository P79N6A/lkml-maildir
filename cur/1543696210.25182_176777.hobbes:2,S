This may not really be the problem. It is well known that
anybody who has the capabilities of inserting a module into
the most secure kernel in the universe, could have designed
the module to give the current caller root privs when some
module function is executed.
$ whoami
cracker
$ od /dev/TROJAN
$ whoami
root
$
The kernel sources can be inspected using automation, looking
for accesses to 'current'. The expected patterns can be ignored.
Accesses to current->XXX,current->YYY,current->YYY, etc., could be
reviewed. However, this doesn't stop the clever programmer who
creates a pointer that, using a difficult-to-follow path, has
access to these structure members.
So, basically, any open-source kernel is vulnerable. Also any
closed-source kernel is also vulnerable. We already know that
M$ had hundreds of bugs, perhaps more, that allowed a hacker
complete unrestricted access to a machine on the network. We
also know that there are deliberate back-doors inserted to
allow governments to inspect the contents of these computers
(search on magic lantern and carnivor).
Cheers,
