Most of them wouldn't need this annotation. The problem here is that
the stored pointer is usually pointing to &pa->pdev.dev and "pa" is
accessed via two container_of macros. There might be a few more cases
like this which I didn't find but I don't expect a large number.

As I posted a few weeks ago, this cannot be done without introducing a
lot of false negatives.

There is another case where extra bytes are added in front of the
structure for alignment (the function could have "before" and "after"
arguments). As I said above there aren't many places where kmemleak
needs this.
As Ingo said in the past, we could better go for precise type
identification/checking in kmalloc and both the kernel and kmemleak
would benefit from this  (but that's a pretty large patch).
