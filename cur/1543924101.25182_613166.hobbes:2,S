We had a (different) bug report involving exactly this external driver 
at some older post 2.6.23 kernel where it turned out it was a problem in 
this driver - and this one also looks really like a problem in their 
driver.
Generally, problems with external drivers should be reported to the 
vendors of these drivers and not here (unless it's clear it's a bug in 
the kernel and not in the driver).
