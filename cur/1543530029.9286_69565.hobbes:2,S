Well, THAT is probably years into the future.
That said, I'd prefer to get rid of the module version entirely, and
possibly embed it as an ELF section name or similar, and not in the
current format. Which would solve the problem entirely. But in the
meantime, even just the simple "get rid of the current silly magic build
flags" would be a big step in the right direction.
