Hi,
 From what I understand from Linus's mail to lkml, there is a difference 
between JFS and XFS:
JFS doesn't require any modifications to existing code, its only an 
addition.
XFS on the contrary is far more intrusive.
So it seems that even if JFS is less complete than XFS (no ACL, quotas 
for instance), and even if it is less robust (I don't know if it is, I 
only used so far XFS and ext3 -with success), its inclusion in current 
kernel is a lot easier and I don't see any (technical) reason for not 
including it.
I don't think ext3 will have difficulties to be included in the kernel 
because a) the guys working on it are lk veterans and b) Redhat (VA 
also) is already including it in its kernels (rawhide AND 7.1 update).
So I only hope that the smart guys at SGI find a way to prepare the 
patches the way Linus loves because now the file 
"patch-2.4.5-xfs-1.0.1-core" (which contains the modifs to the kernel 
and not the new files) is about 174090 bytes which is a lot.

Hello,
Question.
Are there plans to include JFS and XFS in the kernel?
Both those projects have been declared stable by their development
teams, and I'm guessing they can now be included as experimental, just
as reiser has been.
Just curious,
