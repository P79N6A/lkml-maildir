Ah, Zwane was involved - say no more ;)

iirc, find_first_bit(..., N) _must_ return N on nothing-found.  It'd be
untidy to return some randomly-larger number.
I wonder which was the culpable architecture?  Oh, i386.
Note how the i386 implementation's documentation carefully avoids describing
the return value.  I don't think _any_ of our find_foo_bit()
implementations have return-value docs, and here we see the result.
Sigh.  What crap.  I guess we leave it as-is.
