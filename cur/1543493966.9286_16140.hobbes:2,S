Can I just get some clarification here. pthread_cond_signal is
defined as waking *one* thread, thus:
       pthread_cond_signal restarts one of the threads  that  are
       waiting on the condition variable cond.  If no threads are
       waiting on cond, nothing happens. If several  threads  are
       waiting  on  cond, exactly one is restarted, but it is not
       specified which.
Are you saying that the kernel will in fact wake up *all* the threads
(either just internally, or in actuality)?
