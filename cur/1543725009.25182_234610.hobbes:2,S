Would that be a suitable solution to store callout binaries for daemons like
multipathd that need to work in case of system-disk outage (/bin & swap on SAN
for example) ?
If so, is it possible and/or correct for the daemon to do a private ramfs mount
for this purpose ?
And while I'm at throwing all the questions I have on my mind :
* how can I disable on-demand loading for the daemon ?
* does mlockall() provides all the necessary garanties ?
* what explains the "offset-by-4" between VSZ and RSS I see when running
mlockall'ed daemon ?
Thanks for the educational work :)

cvaroqui
