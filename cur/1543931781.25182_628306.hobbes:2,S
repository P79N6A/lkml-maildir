I am not inclined to apply this one.  This practice, applied over time, 
will tend to accumulate weird 'default' and 'select' statements.
So I think the breakage that occurs is mitigated by two factors:
1) kernel hackers that do their own configs are expected to be able to 
figure this stuff.
2) kernel builders (read: distros, mainly) are expected to have put 
thought into the Kconfig selection and driver migration strategies.
PCI IDs move across drivers from time, and we don't want to apply these 
sorts changes:  Viewed in the long term, the suggested patch is merely a 
temporary change to allow kernel experts to more easily deal with the 
PCI ID migration across drivers.
I would prefer simply to communicate to kernel experts and builders 
about a Kconfig issue that could potentially their booting/networking... 
  because this patch is only needed if the kernel experts do not already 
know about a necessary config update.
