Excellent, then I am totally missing something!
Then truncate would have to be implemented, for the very limited case of
using 'cp'.  ;-)
The mount option ('undeltrunc?') would have to be implemented.  However,
I just looked at the strace of vi for fun, and then remembered that it
uses a temporary file which is unlinked after the save.  Considering the
amount of truncates and unlinks that could potentially happen on a
system, .undelete would undoubtedly fill up quickly.  Filtering files
going into .undelete could be an option, but this would be kludgey to
put into the kernel, even for a daemon.
What is your opinion of having a mount option of 'undel' and a mount
option of 'undeltrunc'?  The defaults for mount would be to not do
either.  This way you could do something like:
mount -o undel /		# saves unlink, not truncated
mount /var			# does not save truncated or unlink
mount -o undel,undeltrunc /home	# saves unlink and truncated
A cron job or user daemon (or filter of some sort) could monitor those
directories that were mounted with undel.
