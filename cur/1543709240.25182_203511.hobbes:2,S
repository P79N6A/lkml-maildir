Could you maybe go back to the initial report, which is that after 
poll() gets wrong status? It's nice to argue about where the process 
waits, but the issue is if it gets the same status with 2.4 and 2.6, and 
if not which one should be fixed.
Richard: can you show this with a small demo program? I assume you 
didn't find this just by reading code ;-)
