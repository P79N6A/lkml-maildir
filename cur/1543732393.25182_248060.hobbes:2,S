No I'm removing the need for ioctls to go through the compat layer.
No compat layer, no problem.
I see the compat layer as a hack to support legacy devices without touching
all of their code.
I dont see why a new driver would use the compat hacks instead of simply
building a 32/64 bit compatible interface, and legacy drivers have the
uniqueness for commands solved one way or another.
So the only interesting problem left is for new char devices.
