I don't see much value in this proposal - it would only cause confusion 
for users.
Except for some obscure cases, every application compiled with any libc6 
version is expected to work with even the most recent libc6.
OTOH, libc4/libc5 <-> libc6 is a natural border since support for older 
libc's anyways requires extra support by the distribution.
