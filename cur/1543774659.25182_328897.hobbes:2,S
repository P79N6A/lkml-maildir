I dunno.  I'll often build a tarball of "-mm plus local patches" known to
be working at the moment, precisely so I can just untar that as a known good
base for the next kernel-hackfest, rather than untar Linus's tree, apply all
of the -mm patch, then all my local patches again...
And even if I'm not *that* ambitious, I'll at least tar up a clean -mm tree
to use as a base. :)
And even if I didn't do that, you *do* have to do something when the disk
gets backed up.  You *do* intend for sensible things to happen then, right? ;)
