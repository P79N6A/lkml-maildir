No, it seems unlikely that anyone would build with CONFIG_NUMA and
CONFIG_TINY both enabled.  But it is possible and reasonable to build with
CONFIG_NUMA=y and CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n, which is the case I was trying to speak
to.  If NUMA is on and HOTPLUG is off, then we're wasting kernel text
(granted, it's a very small amount of space) for the register_node() &
unregister_node() functions that we *know* will never be called after
initial bootup.  That's why I suggested marking both of those functions as
__devinit.  But it doesn't make a huge difference either way.
