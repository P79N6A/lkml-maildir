The fix matches the rest of libata on this and fixes a bug that wants
fixing urgently for 2.6.20.
If you want to put your bmdma address at zero then libata-sff won't help
you at the moment, and assumes zero is a safe "not in use" value because
the PCI layer also takes a similar view in places.
libata-sff and thus ata_bmdma_post_internal_cmd() aren't used by non PCI
devices so the bmdma test is ok providing it stays within libata-sff. I
don't think its a problem, although clearly its an assumption that the
core code rather than the SFF code cannot make.
drivers/ide uses roughly the same assumptions without problem.
