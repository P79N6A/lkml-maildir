Many platforms, sparc64 included, do not have an ISA IO space nor do
they provide VGA accesses at all.
If things such as XFree86 are coded for such platforms to not require
VGA accesses (the 'ati' driver is already like this when certain
build time defines are set), this could become a non-issue in this
case.

There is no 'fake' ISA bus number you need.  There is a 'real' one,
the one on which the PCI-->ISA bridge lives, why not use that one
:-)
Then you could find such an ISA bridge, open that PCI device, then
finally perform the PCI_IOCTL_GETIOBASE thingy on it, but I don't like
this get-iobase idea at all, see my next email in this thread for why.
