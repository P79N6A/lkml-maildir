Btw, in case you wonder why I care about names and organization, it's 
because with the names and organization comes assumptions and 
expectations.
One prime example of this is cdrecord, and the incredible braindamage that
the name "SCSI" foisted upon it. Why? Because everybody (ie schily)  
_knows_ that SCSI is addressed by bus/id/lun, and thinks that anything
else is wrong. So you have total idiocies like the "cdrecord -scanbus"  
crap for finding your device, and totally useless naming that makes no 
sense in any sane environment.
Calling something SCSI when it isn't brings on these kinds of bad things: 
people make assuptions that aren't sensible or desireable.
Names have power. There's baggage and assumptions in a name. In the case
of SCSI, there is a _lot_ of baggage.
