Do you have a quick test to demonstrate this ? That would be useful.

Dcache-RCU hasn't changed the dentry freeing to slab much, it is still
LRU. Given a CPU, dentries are still returned to the slab
in dcache LRU order.
I have always wondered about how useful the global dcache LRU 
mechanism is. This adds another reason for us to go experiment
with it.
