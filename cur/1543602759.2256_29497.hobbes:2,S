I also have this problem as mentioned before.
The problem cropped up between 2.4.10-pre5 and 2.4.10-pre6, 
I did some checking. pre5 is fine, pre6 is broken.
From what I saw, my guess is that
genhd.c and the gendisk rewrites might be related.
Unfortunately have no time to look at it until mid-October-
any help appreciated. 
cheers
