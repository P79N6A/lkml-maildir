VIA C3 has the full set of i686 required instructions. The whole story
is a lot more complex
gcc i686 mode outputs cmov instruction sequences without checking cmov
is present at runtime. So gcc "i686" is actually "i686 and a bit". It
actually doesn't really make sense to do a true i686 mode without cmov
either.
Red Hat's rpm knows about this so I'm suprised the Mandrake one gets it
wrong and installs arch=686 packages without checking for cmov.
