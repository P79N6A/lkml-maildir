I've never noticed any errors before, but that could just be a result of me 
never actually bothering to look.

Hmmm....
I'm grasping at straws here.
Let's do some poking into your kernel config.  What do you have set under 
"Processor type and features"?  
I experienced a similar situation once in the past, but that was a result of 
drives losing DMA and doing simultaneous activity on eight drives and four 
controllers.  Moving to the pata_pdc2027x driver seems to have cleared it 
right up.
Sorry I can't provide a quick cure-all!
