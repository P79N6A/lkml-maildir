You patch (now in -mm as use-vm_read-write-exec-to-set-vm_page_prot.patch)
looks good to me, thank you.  But could I persuade you to make it even
better, by instead using the vm_get_page_prot() function Dave Airlie
added some while back?
I did some work on that back in 2.6.18 days, but never got around to
sending it off.  It may be all wrong, or missing pieces, by now; but
appended below in case it helps.  If you don't mind, please update
it and send in the result as yours.  If you do mind, please say so
and I'll do it myself - but we can see it's taken me an age, and
it'd also be very rude for me to stomp on your good work.
Thanks,
Hugh
