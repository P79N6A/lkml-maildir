I saw a comment late last week that someone was seeing cerberus crash
instantaneously with 2.5 on UP machines, so I decided to try to
reproduce this problem.  I got the latest version of ceerbuerus and put
it on a single processor pIII-866 256MB ram, linux-2.5.59 kernel. 
Newburn has been running for just under 5 days now without so much as a
hiccup.
1. Has anyone had first hand experience with this instability?
2. If so, were you just running the default newburn, or something else? 
Please let me know if you did something different that caused it to
crash.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
