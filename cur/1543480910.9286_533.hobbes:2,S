	Hello, I've been using pre-6 for the past few days great, and
grabbed the pre-7 and pre-8 patches today, installed the patches,
recompiled and rebooted to find that the kernel now has a certain dislike
for my internal atapi iomega zip drive. Here is the section of dmesg:
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe800-0xe807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe808-0xe80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: Maxtor 91000D8, ATA DISK drive
hdb: SANYO CRD-168P, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: Maxtor 87000D8, ATA DISK drive
hdd: IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: Maxtor 91000D8, 9543MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=1216/255/63, (U)DMA
hdc: Maxtor 87000D8, 6679MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=14475/15/63, (U)DMA
hdb: ATAPI 8X CDROM drive, 256kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
hdd: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdd: packet command error: error=0x50
ATAPI device hdd:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Invalid field in command packet -- (asc=0x24, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Mode Sense" packet command was:
  "5a 00 2a 00 00 00 00 00 18 00 00 00 "
hdd: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdd: packet command error: error=0x50
ATAPI device hdd:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Invalid field in command packet -- (asc=0x24, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Mode Sense" packet command was:
  "5a 00 2a 00 00 00 00 00 18 00 00 00 "
	It worked fine with pre-6, I can undo the pre-8 patch and see if
pre-7 works, unfortunately, I have homework I should be doing
first. It looks likes theres been weird stuff happening with cdrom's maybe
this might help.
Computer:
ASUS p55t2p4 motherboard, Intel p200mmx no overclocking
I don't think other stuff is related, however, I am happy to provide any
information or do any testing required. 
	Thanks, 
Martin
