Because the write buffer as documented is not allowed to show changes to
the other cpus not in processor order. It can only delay the writes
undefinitely but that make no difference at all for SMP.
If the write buffer would be allowed to cache writes and then to show the
changes to the other CPUS in its preferred order (as on Alpha for example)
then I would consider it of course.
