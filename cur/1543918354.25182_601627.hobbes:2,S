Yes, top typically show 99.3% idle .

Well, there are some kernel threads in the D state. I've seen 
md1_raid1, kjournald and pdflush in the D state. I had a very hard
time trying the catch it to the "foo" file, but take a look at this:

 =======================
Both md2_raid1 and pdflush is in the D state at the same time. I've
also seen md1_raid1 and kjournald in the D state at the same time when
running this: ps aux | awk '// { if ($8 ~ "^D") print $0 }' . Most of
the time, no processes are in the D state, and then two at the same
time...
