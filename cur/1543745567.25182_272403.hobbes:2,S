I got this from the Linux man page for sendto():
 If  sendto  is  used on a connection-mode (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET)
 socket, the parameters to and tolen are ignored (and the error  EISCONN
 may  be  returned when they are not NULL and 0), and the error ENOTCONN
 is returned when the socket was not actually connected.
And Posix 1003.1 offers the following error code for sendto():
  The sendto() function shall fail if:
  ...
  [ENOTCONN]
    The socket is connection-mode but is not connected.
(I'm not saying you're wrong).

sendto() with a NULL address will still work fine.
