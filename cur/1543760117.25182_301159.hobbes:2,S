This is a terrible hardware flaw if it can't be controlled.
Isnt't there a unique sequence we can determine when the horizontal
wheel is tilted?. When I turn off cruise control, all my buttons work
flawlessly, but not getting the autorepeat data. This autorepeat data
occurs between button press and button release and could be easily
forged.

We should manipulate this data when it arrives in the kernel, in my
opinion. It's a faulty device and we should present it to userspace as
working.

Yeah, very, considering the capabilities of this device.

Not an option

I've killed the autoscroll by turning cruise control off; buttons work
then without auto repeat. I'm not sure what you mean here.

I hope this is not the final solution. I should be possible to disable
the data stream intervention if userspace wants to handle this, though.
