That depends what you mean by "must not". If it's your missile guidance
system, aircraft autopilot or life support system, the system must not run
out of memory in the first place. If the system breaks down badly, killing
init and thus panicking (hence rebooting, if the system is set up that
way) seems the best approach.

If SuSE's install program needs more than a quarter Gb of RAM, you need a
better distro.

A computation your system was incapable of performing. OK, it's a shame it
took you a week to find this out, but the computation had to die: if the
only process running cannot run, it has to die!

What on earth did you expect to happen when the process exceeded the
machine's capabilities? Using more than all the resources fails. There
isn't an alternative.
