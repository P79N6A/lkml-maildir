Or just configure it differently.  I use kmail sometimes (either that
or pine) and with a little config tweaking (and a few rules of thumb
about use) it can actually be made to behave resonably fine.
Here are a few tips;
  - Don't cut'n'paste stuff into kmail
  - Go to Settings --> Configure KMail, select Composer, remove the
checkmark from "Word wrap at column ...".
  - Go to Settings --> Configure KMail, select Composer, go to the
Charset tab, make the list read us-ascii, iso-8859-1   - just listing
those two (in that order) seems to generate working mails.
  - Go to Settings --> Configure KMail, select Accounts, go to the
Sending tab, make "Message property" be "Allow 8-bit".
When writing a new message, check the Options menu, make sure Wordwrap
is not enabled and that Encoding is us-ascii or iso-8859-1 (or
possibly something else) - the auto-detect option seems to sometimes
get things wrong.
When inserting a patch or similar into a mail, use Message-->"Insert File"

'pine' actually seems to work pretty damn well once you disable the
flowed-text "feature".

Yeah, email is old, and there are too many ways to do things, too many
conflicting RFC's, compeeting commercial implementations etc etc etc -
the whole thing could do with a from-scratch re-implementation (as if
that's going to happen)...
