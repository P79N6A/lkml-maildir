Agreed.

Agreed.  mm->count might as well remain atomic because that will help
when we come to apply finer grained locking to the mm, but as far as I
am concerned we may as well drop pretty much all of the mmget/mmput
stuff.  The only race I can still see is the possibility of sys_wait*
removing the task struct while we run on SMP.

Yep, fine, as long as we keep the tasklist_lock right until the end of
our use of the task struct.

No, because we already have a sufficient spinlock to protect us.
