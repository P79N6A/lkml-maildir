Hmm, I'm wondering if these are a false positive. Being a fully
preemptible kernel, we could be preempted between taking now and getting
prev, so the prev could be updated to a time after now and show a warp.
William and Rui, could you try this patch and see if you still get the
warnings.  Although I doubt this is really the problem, since I can't
see how it would cause clusters of these messages.
