I'm not really intimately familiar with the ACPI spec, but IIRC those AML
methods executed by pm_ops->prepare and pm_ops->finish are mandatory for
suspending ACPI enabled machines. So using "platform" as a default seems
reasonable (assuming that on non-ACPI machines, pm_ops->{prepare,finish} will
be a noop anyway)
