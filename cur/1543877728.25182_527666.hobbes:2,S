Thanks.

I think you should only use the new behavior for madvise MADV_FREE, not for
MADV_DONTNEED.  The current MADV_DONTNEED behavior (which conflicts with
POSIX POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED, but that doesn't matter since what glibc
maps posix_madvise POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED in madvise call if anything doesn't
have to be MADV_DONTNEED, but can be anything else) is apparently documented
in Linux man pages:
       MADV_DONTNEED
              Do not expect access in the near future.  (For the time being, the application is finished with  the
              given  range, so the kernel can free resources associated with it.)  Subsequent accesses of pages in
              this range will succeed, but will result either in re-loading of the memory contents from the under-
              lying mapped file (see mmap()) or zero-fill-on-demand pages for mappings without an underlying file.
so it wouldn't surprise me if something relied on zero filling.
So IMHO madv_free in details should be only set if MADV_FREE.
Also, I think MADV_FREE shouldn't do anything at all (i.e. don't call
zap_page_range, but don't fail either) for shared or file backed vmas,
only for private anon memory it should do something.  After all, it
is just an optimization and it makes sense only for private anon mappings.
