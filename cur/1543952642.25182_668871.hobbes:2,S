It may be intended for debuging purposes, but it does get used in
production HPC environments (a lot!). I guess I've never seen this
lockup before because SGI customers don't use ext3, but they have
complained about the system "stopping" while drop_caches is executed.
This locking ..... strategy would explain it, though.
I'll try the patch, but I can't guarantee anything - I only saw this
lockup once in about 18 hours when dropping caches every 2 seconds.
Cheers,
Dave.
