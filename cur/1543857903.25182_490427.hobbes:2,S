Comments:
* [oh, everybody will hate me for saying this, but...]  to me, "kevent" 
implies an internal kernel subsystem.  I would rather call it "uevent" 
or anything else lacking a 'k' prefix.
* I like the absolute timespec (and use of timespec itself)
* more on naming:  I think kevent_open would be more natural than 
kevent_init, since it opens a file descriptor.
* why is KEVENT_MAX not equal to KEVENT_POSIX_TIMER?  (perhaps answer 
this question in a comment, if it is not a mistake)
* Kill all the CONFIG_KEVENT_xxx sub-options, or hide them under 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED.  Application developers should NOT be left wondering 
whether or support for KEVENT_INODE was compiled into the kernel.
