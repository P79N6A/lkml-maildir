well, this is obviously the wrong solution.  If both boards are PCI boards,
they can easily share the IRQ between them. 
If one of the boards is an ISA device, configure your BIOS correctly 
(i.e. telling it that IRQ11 is used by a non-pnp legacy ISA device).

You can't just change the IRQ in pci config space.  You will not change the
real IRQ mapping but just somthing the BIOS wrote there during initialization.
