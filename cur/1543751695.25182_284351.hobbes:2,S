[PATCH] USB: gadget kconfig doc updates
This updates the "USB Gadget" Kconfig support:
    -	Highlighting the the two Documentation/usb files have
	information about how to interoperate with MS-Windows
	using RNDIS or CDC-ACM;
    -	Flagging CDC ACM and CDC Ethernet support in the config
    	menu descriptions;
    -	Providing a bit more description about what a "gadget driver"
	does, for the benefit of folk coming to this part of Linux
	with background in similar proprietary driver stacks.
    -	Pointing to the Linux-USB website for this API, and the
	kerneldoc.
In short:  make important driver framework information more accessible.

+	  A Linux "Gadget Driver" talks to the USB Peripheral Controller
+	  driver through the abstract "gadget" API.  Some other operating

+	  are a subset (implementing a USB device class specification).
+	  A gadget driver implements one or more USB functions using
+	  the peripheral hardware.
+
+	  Gadget drivers are hardware-neutral, or "platform independent",
+	  except that they sometimes must understand quirks or limitations
+	  of the particular controllers they work with.  For example, when
+	  a controller doesn't support alternate configurations or provide
+	  enough of the right types of endpoints, the gadget driver might
+	  not be able work with that controller, or might need to implement
+	  a less common variant of a device class protocol.
