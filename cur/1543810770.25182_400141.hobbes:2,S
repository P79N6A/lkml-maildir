The sys_mmap2() ABI is that the page shift is always fixed to whatever 
page size is reasonable for the architecture, typically 2^12.  The syscall 
should never be exposed as mmap2(), only as the large file size version 
of mmap() (aka mmap64()).  The other consideration is that it should not 
be implemented in 64 bit ABIs, as those machines should be using a 64 bit 
native mmap().  Does that clear things up a bit?  Cheers,
