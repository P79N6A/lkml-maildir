The proper trick for this is:
1. place you "for each page" code in a #define like so:
#define FOR_EACH_PAGE_INNER do{ ... code ... }while(0);
2. create your function in a separate .h file without the double-include guard
3. inside this code, exchange the indirect function call with your define name:
(*fn)(args); --> FOR_EACH_PAGE_INNER
4. document how the macro will receive certain variables from it's
outer scope, and should leave the "function result" in another one.
this in effect creates a different copy of the page walker for each
function, and inlines your code in it.. just like it would do with a
C++ template.
A place where you can see this technique working is the software
triangle filler from MESA.
The doubt is... is this acceptable regarding linux-kernel coding-style?
