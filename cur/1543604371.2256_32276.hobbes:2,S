   tcp.c:855: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
   the following patch, changes min() to min_t() to make size_t explicit.
Applied, but with a cleanup, please never do this:
   -		min(
   +		min_t (
"min_t" is not a C operator, therefore no reason to put a space
between "min_t" and the openning parenthesis.  If you look around,
this is the general coding style rule the Linux code follows:
	if ()  /* <--- space here */
	while () /* <--- and here */
	foo_function() /* <--- but not here */
For example.
Franks a lot,
