No worse than Raúl writing his in Spanish would be.   Welsh
may be a niche but it is a valid niche.  I understand that
the worlds longest running television serial drama (here in
the US we call them soap operas) is in Welsh.  Of course if
it is Welse means i can't read it :( Maybe this will provide
the impetus for babelfish to support Welsh.  I expect Alan
writing his diary in Welsh is good practice so, Good Alan,
good, good :)
