I have a CentOS 4.4 system with 2.6.9-42 kernel. I will update the kernel to the new one.

You have a broken source tree then.  Where did your kernel source come
from then?  I'm not able to find any version of asm-i386/bitops.h
where clear_bit() doesn't have LOCK_PREFIX in any of the trees I
happen to have lying around  (which includes some very old trees like 2.4.21)
