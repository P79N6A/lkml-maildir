  Are you afraid to learn something new? ;) Just joking. But really,
  it doesn't have to be very difficult. The extra streams etc would
  just be saved as files. If tar is patched then it would be no
  problem and no extra stuff but perhaps a switch --save-metas.

  Actually MacOS and Windows support multiple streams, only Linux
  doesn't. But of course there are BSD's etc too. I'd say to leave
  them behind.
  The file streams would make my day a lot easier. The idea to
  split up contents of OO.org files into streams is bad. But that
  doesn't make the file streams bad. I see many uses that would make
  my every day life easier.
  It isn't about cross plat form compatibility, but to add features
  that are useful and meta-data and file streams are.
  Also. No one forces you to use either meta-data or streams, just as
  no one forces you to use ACLs or other things.

  I do not think the Samba would really require the streams support
  but it would certainly make life easier for Samba. Not to mention
  that these files would also be natively viewed on the Linux host.

  I would agree with tunnel vision. The kernel should provide the
  tools and options. Users and developers can then invent new things
  to use them. :)
