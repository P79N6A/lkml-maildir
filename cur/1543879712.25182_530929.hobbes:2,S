Bill, you come from a BSD background and you are still relatively new to 
Linux development, so i dont at all fault you for misunderstanding this 
situation, and fortunately i have a really easy resolution for your 
worries: i did exactly that! :)
i wrote the first line of code of the CFS patch this week, 8am Wednesday 
morning, and released it to lkml 62 hours later, 22pm on Friday. (I've 
listed the file timestamps of my backup patches further below, for all 
the fine details.)
I prefer such early releases to lkml _alot_ more than any private review 
process. I released the CFS code about 6 hours after i thought "okay, 
this looks pretty good" and i spent those final 6 hours on testing it 
(making sure it doesnt blow up on your box, etc.), in the final 2 hours 
i showed it to two folks i could reach on IRC (Arjan and Thomas) and on 
various finishing touches. It doesnt get much faster than that and i 
definitely didnt want to sit on it even one day longer because i very 
much thought that Con and others should definitely see this work!
And i very much credited (and still credit) Con for the whole fairness 
angle:
||  i'd like to give credit to Con Kolivas for the general approach here:
||  he has proven via RSDL/SD that 'fair scheduling' is possible and that
||  it results in better desktop scheduling. Kudos Con!
the 'design consultation' phase you are talking about is _NOW_! :)
I got the v1 code out to Con, to Mike and to many others ASAP. That's 
how you are able to comment on this thread and be part of the 
development process to begin with, in a 'private consultation' setup 
you'd not have had any opportunity to see _any_ of this.
In the BSD space there seem to be more 'political' mechanisms for 
development, but Linux is truly about doing things out in the open, and 
doing it immediately.
Okay? ;-)
Here's the timestamps of all my backups of the patch, from its humble 4K 
beginnings to the 100K first-cut v1 result:
