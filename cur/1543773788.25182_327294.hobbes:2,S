And which ones that __WORK__?  We have a few customers out there from
both distros and all the crash dump methods that I've seen fail either
ALWAYS or ALMOST ALWAYS on customer sites.  And yes, we hear about them

us and our customers.
Kexec/kdump has a chance of working reliably.  The others are complete
crap.
