Alexander,
If I was talking on the level of disassembling anything that calls
request_module() then, of course, I *knew* what exactly happens if
CONFIG_KMOD is undefined.

No, it is not OK. Because, as I said in the message, gcc will *not*
optimize away the bogus sprintf(name...) calculation which I considered
unacceptable. If we are willing to make a function call to sprintf() and
actually do some work in it we should be more than willing to make a
function call to an almost empty request_module() (when CONFIG_KMOD is
undefined). See my point?

I thought va_start/va_end magic handles that automatically, i.e. if
sprintf(buf, "%s", "hello") does the same as sprintf(buf, "hello") then
our new request_module() should work fine as well.
Thanks,
Tigran.
