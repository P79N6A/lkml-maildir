I'm seeing similar things occasionally with 2.6.9+kgdb+suspend2+Win4Lin
on ht/preempt/regparm/4gb highmem. I've come to the conclusion it's
probably not directly suspend (I can do 100 cycles on the trot), but
haven't been able to reliably reproduce it. The corruption is always in
fs related data, but apart from that seems random. Seeing the mention of
being unable to allocate a page at the bottom of David's email makes me
wonder if the difficulties with memory freeing are triggering some code
that's not properly handling failed page allocations.
Regards,
Nigel
