Got this (perhaps from updatedb?) on my SMP box running 2.3.25. 
Have never seen this before except once (with 2.3.24 with the inode
__iget(old/inode) fix that went into 2.3.25 applied).
EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,2)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 536602

EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,2)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 536604
...dev 3,2 is /dev/hda2 which is mounted on /d1 on my system.  I use this
partition for source compilation only.

...Actually, I never actually compiled anything in that directory -- I
simply untarred, cp -a'd "linux" to "linux-pre2", mv'd "linux" to
"linux-pre1", applied pre-patch-2.3.26-1 to "linux-pre1", applied
pre-patch-2.3.26-2 to "linux-pre2" and diff -urN'd them to see the
changes.  I read the output then went on and did other unrelated stuff. 
No errors occurred until this morning, when I was reading linux-kernel in
mutt (locally).  I believe it could have been updatedb running, though.
The last time this happened, I also saw three errors like above, and it
was also related somehow to a copy of the kernel tree on my system.  As I
mentioned before, there has never been any sort of similar corruption
on kernels before 2.3.24 (2.3.18acsomething seemed fine, but maybe I didn't trigger
it) -- 2.2 kernels have been fine on this machine.
This box has 128 MB ECC-SDRAM (ECC enabled), and it had a few other
things running at the time (netscape, 20 or so rxvts, mpg123, etc.).

Woops, I didn't install hdparm yet. :)
