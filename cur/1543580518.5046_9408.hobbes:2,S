Hmmm, arguably reading pages we do not want is a mistake. I should think that
if a big performance win is required to justify a design choice, it should
be especially required to show such a win for doing something that on its
face is wrong.
I am skeptical of the argument that we can win by replacing "the least
desirable" pages with pages were even less desireable and that we have
no recent indication of any need for. It seems possible under heavy swap
to discard quite a portion of the useful pages in favor of junk that just
happenned to have a lucky disk address.
