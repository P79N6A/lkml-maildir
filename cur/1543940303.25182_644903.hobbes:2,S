I don't think it needs a CONFIG. The code should handle this case 
by itself in any case. I'm not entirely sure it does currently, but if it 
doesn't it will likely not be very difficult to fix.
Or are you worried about code size? ACPI is around ~270k on x86-64, 
which while certainly not small should not be a problem on x86 NUMA
systems.
