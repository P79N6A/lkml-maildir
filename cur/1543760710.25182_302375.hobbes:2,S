Hi,
With the 2.6 Linux kernel, I want to find, from the physical page
frame, the virtual address of the page loaded in the frame and the
process id of the process owning it.
I know that 2.6 kernel implements rmap where the page points to a pte
chain. But how to I get to the pid and virtual address from pte entry?
I have tried to become a member of this list. But don't have a confirmation yet.
So, please cc the replies to me.
thanks,
Allison
