Ah!  Thanks for that ... viaarena.com should be definitive
(since it's an official site), and might solve the whole "my
motherboard has a VT836[1234567890xdeadbeef]" game for those
K?133 chipsets.

The patch should apply to all KL133 chipsets; from what you've
said, that appears to be the VT8361 and VT8364.
The KM133 (VT8365) is a less clear.  From what I understand, it
has an integrated video card (ProSavage), but it also has an AGP
slot so that you can use your own video card if you like.  We
_may_ want to clear bit 5 if we're not using the integrated
ProSavage.  The only way to confirm this is to find somebody who
has a KM133 who is using an external video card, and see what the
Windows VIA drivers do.  Any volunteers?
In general though, I think we should apply the same behaviour to
the KM133 that we're using for the KL133 -- leave bit 5 alone,
and don't clear it.  All the VT836?s seem to have issues with
touching bit 5, anyway, with or without the integrated ProSavage.

The northbridge chipsets are already correctly detected (revision
IDs 0x81/0x84).  I'm taking a guess that the VT8365 is revision
ID 0x84, and either the VT8361 or VT8364 is revision ID 0x81, but
I don't know which one.  I'm not sure if finding out what's what
is that important (other than being a pedant with the macro
names), since we haven't hit anybody yet who has a KL133 with a
northbridge that is not a revision of 0x81.
In a nutshell, it's just the macro names and comments which need
to be clarified.  (Not that they're any less important.)  Thanks
for pointing out the disparity :).
