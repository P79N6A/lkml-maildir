Using 2.4.18-rc2 with an Intel RAID SRCU-1 controller (I2O) my processes lock after writing X data to the array. Not every process locks, but I can consistently reproduce the problem with dd. The kernel continues running just fine. I have tried SMP and non, the result is the same. 
If anyone has any experience or can offer suggestions, please CC me.
Thanks.
