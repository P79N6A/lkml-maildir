Any numbers about the expected "large side"? 
We would need <30 microseconds irq latency,
and <<1 milliseconds rt application latency.

The hardware is invariable. It is an embedded system with no PCI slots.
And it seems to be possible with UHCI, 
because vxWorks allows USB stick transfers in operation without
missing latency requirements.
I do not require rt on the USB, it may block its own irq as long as
it likes, but it should not affect other irqs.
