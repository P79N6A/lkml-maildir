from mm/mlock.c:do_mlock() in 2.6.8:
	if (on && !capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK))
		return -EPERM;
i.e. only root or capabilities can make mlock() usable.

Lee, Jack and I have been very willing to discuss the issue. Christoph
isn't willing to discuss it, he's just told us "its the wrong design,
and I'm not telling you why or what's better". If there is a better
design that will end up in the mainstream kernel, we'd love to see it
implemented, and will likely be involved in doing it, because its
really important to us.
