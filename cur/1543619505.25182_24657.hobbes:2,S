Actually, it does make sense - It still doesn't prevent someone from
announcing a higher level person for a subsystem, or even a person at
the same level.
Announcements shouldn't be rigid, it's up to who the lieutenants will
accept patches from. They can still accept them from outside the announced
lists, though that may increase the amount of effort.
