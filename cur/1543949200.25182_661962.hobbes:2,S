After seeing commit d48567dd43868b3d2e1fcc33ee76dc2d38a1ddeb that 
schedules ide-tape for removal I'm wondering whether any cleanups of 
this driver make any sense at all:
What:   ide-tape driver
When:   July 2008
Files:  drivers/ide/ide-tape.c
Why:    This driver might not have any users anymore and maintaining it for no
        reason is an effort no one wants to make.
Who:    Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz <bzolnier@gmail.com>, Borislav Petkov
        <petkovbb@googlemail.com>
Your patches will go in 2.6.26 and the driver will be removed
in 2.6.27 ...
