... you forgot that if we find a nice way to use the CryptoAPI, we can
remove the old md4/md5 code: that makes 631 lines of code go away!

I agree that it could have been a bit more readable.
It is trivial to wrap the code that deals with the CryptoAPI into nice
"helper" functions. For example the cifs_do_hash() function does exactly
that. Putting scatterlist setup into one function will probably help a
lot on code readability and code size.

True, I agree that it's perhaps a bit overkill. Anyway, this is just a
project for me to learn more about the kernel; it's not like I have a
burning desire to convert CIFS to use the CryptoAPI ;-)
