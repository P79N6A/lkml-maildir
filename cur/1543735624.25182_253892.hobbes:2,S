My apologies if something like this is already in the source. Just
throwing out an idea to the wolves. ;)
From /proc/self/mounts I take it that that's meant to be a list of 
mountpoints the requesting process sees. So... why not have instances
of mountlists. The default is what the kernel starts with and each
process inherits. The chroot creates a 2nd instance so that any
processes spawned from that one see the mountlist from that instance.
Each process would, obviously, inherit the mountlist instance from
its parent. 
The hassle happens when you want to deal with the process that began
an instance dieing without taking its children out with it. One way
to deal with it would be to introduce a counter, but that would 
require locking to keep it serialised.
