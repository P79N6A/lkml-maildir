I'm running fc6 but with kernel 2.6.21 from kernel.org - compiled with 
the .config file from fc6.
My system is a asus laptop with an ich7 chipset which has both sata and 
pata controllers. My
laptop only brings out the pata controller interface and both my hd and 
od are on the second
channel of the pata.
So can I configure out the old ide and just have ata_piix automatically 
control them both in
2.6.21?
Thanks,
Steve
