Yep. The meye driver uses 256 PAGE_SIZE buffers. The kernel virtual
pointers to these buffers are stored in mchip_ptable[]. The
"toc" containing the dma pointers to these buffers must be given
to the device as a table having 256 entries, each being 32 bits in length.
In the code I used the last entry of mchip_ptable to store the toc,
but I could as well construct a different data structure.
Anyway, the device expects a dma_addr to be 32 bits in length, so this
will not work anyway with HIGHMEM32 (moreover, this is a driver for the
motion eye camera which is found only in C1 Vaio Sony laptops, which
motherboard is limited to 384 MB...).
I can see only two solutions:
	*) put the toc in a different, dma_addr_t[] structure, so the
	   driver will compile even with HIGHMEM32 (but won't work...)
	*) exclude meye from kernel config when HIGHMEM32 is set.
Which one do you prefer ?
Stelian.
