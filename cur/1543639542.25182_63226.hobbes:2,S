IBM has a fantastic clause in their open source license.  The license grants
you various rights to use, etc., and then goes on to say something in 
the termination section (I think) along the lines of 
	In the event that You or your affiliates instigate patent, trademark,
	and/or any other intellectual property suits, this license terminates
	as of the filing date of said suit[s].
You get the idea.  It's basically "screw me, OK, then screw you too" language.
