You can leave IDE_BUSY there, that's ok. It's not invalid for IDE_BUSY
to be set while IDE_DMA gets cleared. That's expected.

Same case as the one I described in the email following this, will only
happen for TCQ with release interrupt enabled. Otherwise it's illegal to
release the bus from the tcq interrupt handler. Since I removed all
traces of that long ago, you can safely kill the
	} else if (startstop == ide_released)
		queue_commands(drive);
part of it.
The rest looks sane. If handler returns it's no longer busy
(ide_stopped), we clear IDE_BUSY (IDE_DMA damn well better be cleared at
this point as well!!) and let do_request() start a new request (heck or
the same, we don't know and don't care).
