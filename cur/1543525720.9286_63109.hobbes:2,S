Hi,
 I am a newbie as far as kernel development is concerned. I was not able
to find a solution to my problem from any of the archives (earlier
postings included), hence this posting. Please bear with me for my
slightly detailed posting.
I am working with 2.0.36 and tried to add a system call. The following
were the steps I took:
(1) Added .long SYMBOL_NAME(sys_newcall)   /* 190 */ 
	  .space (NR_syscalls-190)*4 
   to arch/i386/kernel/entry.S for entry in the system_call_table
  
(2) Added #define __NR_newcall 190 
    to include/asm-i386/unistd.h
(3) Added code 
    asmlinkage int sys_newcall(char * name, int no)
    { 
	/* code, just return a constant */
    } 
    to fs/open.c
(4) added declaration for sys_newcall to include/linux/fs.h
(/usr/include/linux /usr/include/asm /usr/include/scsi all point to the
respective directories in  /usr/src/linux/include/)
the code compiled fine and booted without problems. after login 
I am unable to compile even a simple program (even one that does not use
the new system call). it just says "aborted".
Even things like man do not work either.
Could anyone please help me out ?? Am I missing out any important criteria
or step ??
Thanks a lot in advance for any help
regards
badri
