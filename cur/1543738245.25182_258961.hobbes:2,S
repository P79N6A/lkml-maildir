No, I was talking about the non-exclusive part of cpusets that wouldn't
fit inside another mechanism. The basic partitioning I have no problem
with, and that seemed to cover most of the requirements, AFAICS.
As I've said before, the exclusive stuff makes sense, and is useful to
a wider audience, I think. Having non-exclusive stuff whilst still 
requiring physical partioning is what I think is obscure, won't work
well (cpus_allowed is problematic) and could be done in userspace anyway.
