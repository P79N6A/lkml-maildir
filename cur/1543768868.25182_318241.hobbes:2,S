Digging harder into my memory, I think the primary reason why lock_cpu_hotplug
was added in sched_setaffinity was this: some code wants to temporarily
override a (user-space) task's cpu mask. Before stop_machine came along, module
code was doing that (again if my memory serves me right). With stop_machine,
temporary changing of user-space (rmmod's) cpus_allowed is not reqd.
However I still see other code (like acpi_processor_set_performance) which
does something like this:
        saved_mask = current->cpus_allowed;
        set_cpus_allowed(current, new_mask);
        /* Do something ..Could block */
        set_cpus_allowed(current, saved_mask);
How do you ensure that saved_mask has not changed since the time
we took a snapshot of it (bcoz of sched_setaffinity having
changed it)? lock_cpu_hotplug could serialize such pieces of code

Essentialy, if I remember correct, sched_migrate_task was also doing
something like acpi_processor_set_performance to migrate a task to a new cpu. 
Thats why we discussed that sched_migrate_task should take lock_cpu_hotplug.  
But I don't think it ever went in. There were concerns of cache-line bounces 
on NUMA m/c bcoz of lock_cpu_hotplug in a frequently executed code like 
sched_migrate_task. Moreover sched_migrate_task no longer behaves like 
acpi_processor_set_performance when it wants to migrate a user-space task to a 
different CPU. It now seems to take the help of migration thread (which is 
much neater compared to what was there earlier i guess).

I recommend that we keep the lock_cpu_hotplug in sched_affinity
unless we figure out a different way of solving the race I highlighted above
or we ban code like that in acpi_processor_set_performance :)
