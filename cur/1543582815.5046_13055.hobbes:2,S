The answer is 'yes', it's been in since at least the beginning of 2.2:
http://innominate.org/cgi-bin/lksr/linux/fs/namei.c?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=v2.2
Search for '.'.
By the way, out whole linux cvsweb tree is here:
	
http://lksr.org/
 
will all versions of linux back to linux-0.97.pl5, with a makefile that
starts out with:
	#
	# Makefile for linux.
	# If you don't have '-mstring-insns' in your gcc (and nobody but me has
:-)
	# remove them from the CFLAGS defines.
	#
Getting back on topic, this makes the idea of getting rid of the actual
on-disk "." and ".." entries a little less scary, though I am keeping in
mind the fact that having those entries on disk could in some extreme
circumstance help fsck recover a a corrupted directory tree little
better and more automatically.
I resolve not to take a position on this subject, and I will carry
forward both a 'squeaky clean' backward-compatible version that sets an
INCOMPAT flag, and a 'slightly tarnished' but very clever version that
is both forward and backward-compatible, along the lines suggested by
Ted.  Both flavors have the desireable property that old versions of
fsck with no knowledge of the new index structure can remove the indices
automatically, with fsck -y.
