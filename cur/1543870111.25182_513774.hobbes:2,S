And my parallel port Iomega ZIP drive, it seems. I actually checked 
earlier and although it doesn't use DMA (it says it's using "EPP 
32-bit") it does use bidrectional communication; it's an sd device.
I admit most of those will be confined to history as well with respect 
to actual use (they existed with 100MB, 250 and 750MB disks, although 
the 750 one probably not as parallel) but they looked cool, so people 
haven't just thrown them away yet :)
