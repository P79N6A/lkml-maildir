Hi!
[1.] When certain programs run 2.2.10 freezes (hard lockup)
[2.] I have experienced lockups (twice) when running cdparanoia, bladeenc, X11
and xmms (and a wav player in the second lockup). At both lockups I was in X.
Symptoms: Ctr-Alt-Del and ping from some other networked machine fails.
IMHO the problem could be caused from interactions of IDE-CD and SB16 drivers.
cdparanoia was reniced in both cases (to -15 or something like that).

Kernel and modules were compiled with -O3
I'm running a FB device with Permedia2 experimental code.
(IMHO it is not to be blamed for freez as it happend in X in both cases).

I believe I'm able to reproduce the bug but I'd rather not do it as I fear for
my data (I already had quite some problems during the two lockups I
encountered).
