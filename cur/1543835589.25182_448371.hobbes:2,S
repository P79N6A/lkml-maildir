Maybe, but some really odd things were happening in /sys with the
patch. I could still follow the bogus symlinks. More than that
/sys/class/mem/mem$ cd ../../class
and
/sys/class/mem/mem$ cd ../..
_both_ ended up with a $PWD of /sys/class.
With the patch reverted, udev now works correctly (thanks, Laurent), and
/sys/class/mem/mem$ cd ../../class
fails with the expected error.
