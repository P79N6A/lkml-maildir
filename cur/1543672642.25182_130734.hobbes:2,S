Neither would I - yet. And the single functions are just part of the
problem, the lowest hanging fruits maybe. In the next step, we have to
find cases like the below and fix them. 4608 bytes should still be ok,
especially since the interrupt stuff is still on the per-process
stack. 
The real bitch is that those cases depend on your .config and your
hardware, so finding them will take quite some time and cannot be done
by a couple of developers alone. Damn!
