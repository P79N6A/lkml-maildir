Subject: given a struct sock, how to find pid of process that owns it?

I'm working on a small app similar to netstat that only cares about unix 
sockets.
I can easily walk /proc/net/unix, but to find the owner of the socket I 
need to scan /proc, which gets expensive.
Accordingly, I'd like to extend /proc/net/unix to also dump out the pid 
of the process that owns the socket.  The only thing is, I can't seem to 
figure out how to find the pid of the socket owner given a pointer to 
the socket struct.
Any tips?  Is it even there?
Thanks,
Chris
