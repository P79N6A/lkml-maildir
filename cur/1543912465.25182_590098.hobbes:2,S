objcopy -j .text input.o output.o
objcopy -O binary output.o output2.o
Then you can objdump -S output.o and count. output2.o has the ELF header
stripped, so provides the raw size, but at the cost of not being able to run
objdump. If you know that every instruction is fixed size, then of course
output2.o is easy.
