You could try bumping the limit for the warning in
arch/powerpc/kernel/irq.c
	if (unlikely(sp < (sizeof(struct thread_info) + 2048)))
Change it to 4096.
Unfortunately if the long call chain is in an interrupt disabled area
you will not get warned.

You can do it sometime before the hang to see if you are getting close
to overflowing the stack.
