Suspend is also broken on my HP nx6325 (hangs hard in the last phase of
suspend) and git-cpufreq.patch is responsible for that (as shown by bisection).
Reverting git-cpufreq.patch makes suspend work again, although it still is a
bit flaky (it takes well more than 5 seconds to suspend and the sound adapter
doesn't work right after the resume, but it starts to work again about 10s
later).
