   How about being able to set the link at boot time too - this is for those
   sites that have multiple kernels installed (for instance: old reliable,
   current reliable, and test). Then each kernel could use different modules
   selected at boot time.
If you know you can always find the the module files (or the header
files, now) by doing a /lib/modules/`uname -r`, why do you need to set a
link at boot time?  It makes things a little faster, and perhaps a
little easier for some build scripts, but does it enough to make a
difference?  insmod already knows how to deal with this, and it doesn't
seem to be any kind of major burden.
