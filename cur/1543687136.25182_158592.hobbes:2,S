Ok, I took it out for a quick spin...
Test-starve.c starvation is back (curable via other means), but irman2 is 
utterly harmless.  Responsiveness under load is very nice until I get to 
the "very hefty" end of the spectrum (expected).  Throughput is down a bit 
at make -j30, and there are many cc1's running at very high priority once 
swap becomes moderately busy.  OTOH, concurrency for the make -jN in 
general appears to be up a bit.  X is pretty choppy when moving windows 
around, but that _appears_ to be the newer/tamer backboost bleeding a 
kdeinit thread a bit too dry.  (I think it'll be easy to correct, will let 
you know if what I have in mind to test that theory works out).  Ending on 
a decidedly positive note, I can no longer reproduce priority inversion 
troubles with xmms's gl thread, nor with blender.
(/me wonders what the reports from wine/game folks will be like)
