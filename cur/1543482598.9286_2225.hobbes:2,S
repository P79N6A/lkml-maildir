Well, that's not quite the way I interpret it: the process simply won't
run AT ALL again until all jobs in the run-queue have finished their
time-slices (unless my brain's going).
And, certainly the one I fixed last month (in
tty_ioctl.c/tty_wait_until_sent()) was a REAL problem.  It was causing
tcsh on loaded SMP machines to go to the back of the queue for CPU time
basically every time you pressed "enter".  This means 200ms delay *
(loadavg/Ncpus) each time.
(It does depend though on why you were scheduling in the first place.)
When I first saw the problem in tty_ioctl.c, Linus said that because the
driver was setting TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE it will not get the CPU back
anyway (until the wait queue responds in that particular case).  In the
cases I have just changed, the driver won't get the CPU back until the
timeout expires in schedule_timeout().  Once the timeout expires, why on
earth would we want the driver to be low-priority?  I'm not saying
that's impossible, just that I don't see a reason - do feel encouraged
to put me straight ;-)
I have to admit though that I don't even use any of the drivers I have
patched so I can't say I've had a problem with them (!).
