Well... Configured to run XF86_SVGA with "noaccel" option last night
(XF86_S3V does support noaccel AFICT).  Dead by morning. :-(  I'll
attach the oops report in case it tells you anything.  I even verified
that the server reported the "noaccel" option when it fired up.

Didn't get to try this last night, unfortunately.  My plans got
interrupted, but I'll do it tonight.  I'll also try upgrading to the
absolute latest & greatest XFree86 servers.
Just thought of something that I *think* is unrelated.  With latest
kernels, I can't get my BusLogic FlashPoint LT to talk to my SCSI ZIP
drive.  Systems hangs hard when I try, sometimes during the probe.
For now, I just replaced it with a BT-946C, which seems to work just
fine.  These symptoms are the same with my old MB and my new MB.
Unless you think its related, I'll wait to solve this X hang thing
before I talk to Leonard about this FlashPoint problem.
That's all I know for now.  Thanks.
