TSO on the r8169 is the magic switch but the regression makes imvho more
sense from a VM pov:
- the corrupted file has the same size as the expected file
- the corrupted file exhibits holes which come as a multiple of 4096 bytes
  (8*4k, 2 places, there may be more)
- the r8169 driver does not know what a page is
- the 8169 hardware has a small 8192 bytes Tx buffer
It would be nice if someone could do a sendfile + vsftp test with TSO on a
different hardware. While I could not reproduce the corruption when simply
downloading a file that I had copied on the server with scp, it triggered
almost immediately after I copied it locally and tried to download the copy.
