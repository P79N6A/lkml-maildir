To answer my own question. Now that I traced the codepaths of
compat_ioctl, I see that this particular problem has been worked
around by calling do_screeninfo_to_user() which resided in
fs/compat_ioctl.c (as of 2.6.14) and now moved to
drivers/video/fbmem.c where it actually belongs.
The problem in my case was my incorrect implementation of compat_ioctl
method in my driver that called filp->f_op->ioctl() for that matter.
Stupid me.
Just in case someone ever needs this.
