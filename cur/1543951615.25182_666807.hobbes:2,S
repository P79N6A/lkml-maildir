Agree. Ignoring all the DMA errors in kdump kernel does not sound very
good.
On a side note, typically how much time does it take to for DMA operations
to finish. Can we wait for a random amount of time in second kernel,
hoping all the DMA operations are complete, and then setup a new table?
This can be atleast a stop gap solution till we come up with a good
solution?
Thanks
