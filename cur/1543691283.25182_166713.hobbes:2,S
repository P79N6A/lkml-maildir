   It depends on definition of software. It is so hard to draw parallel 
especially when what looks like controller runs some flavour of Linux 
from some embedded flash ;-)

arrive completely. Sometimes low latencies (even on narrow bandwidth 
links) are _that_ important...

    There should be some SCO's source code in Linux -
