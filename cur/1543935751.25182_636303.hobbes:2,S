Hi,
In windows one can configure at what point the uart will trigger an
interrupt. E.g. 1, 4, 8 or 14 bytes received. Setserial doesn't let you
and I saw in the sources of the serial driver no hint that it is
supported in linux at all. Also in MAINTAINERS I saw that sreial is
orphaned. Can someone tell how I can proceed with this? Is it at all
possible to do this setting?
