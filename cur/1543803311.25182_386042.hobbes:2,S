I am attempting to setup a firewall for an NFS v3 server.  I need to know where
the lockd ports will be.  I have added an append line to my lilo.conf
that looks like
this, and it was working in the 2.4 kernels:
append="lockd.nlm_udpport=32768 lockd.nlm_tcpport=32768"
I am using kernel 2.6.15 from ftp.kernel.org and I am trying to learn
what to do.
But the file fs/lockd/svc.c seems to want this without the 'lock.' in front.
But the file Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt suggests
lockd.udpport and lockd.tcpport (no "nlm_").
1.  Why do the files in the kernel disagree with each other?
2.  What do I really need on my append="" line, or is there some other
     way to set this now?
3.  Should I hardcode the ports in the kernel source code and recompile?
Thank you,
JGH
