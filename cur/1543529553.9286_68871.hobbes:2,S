No, you don't get it. Just to run "ls" from emacs you will need many
extra megabytes of swap space. Unlike UNIX and BSD users, Linux users
have long taken advantage of the ability to operate without very much
swap space at all. Some people don't even have swap space.

No, that isn't right. Processes (files) that don't grab any more
memory (disk space) don't get killed (deleted).
Current policy is like this:
   You have a file with holes or other compression. When you try to
   write to this, the file gets removed.
Rik's OOM patch:
   You have a file with holes or other compression. When you try to
   write to this, the kernel searches for junk files. It finds core
   files, /tmp files, emacs backup files, *.o files...
(hmmm, I think something bad does happen when you mmap a sparse
file and write to it while the disk is full... should fix that too,
but unlike OOM this ought to be 90% userspace)

You sit at a serial console 24x7 waiting for an OOM condition?
For most people, servers (including X) just die randomly and there
is no way out besides a reboot.
