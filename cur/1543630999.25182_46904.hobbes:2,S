The tasklet code also needs fixing. It is a miracle that the kernel
booted when I tested that code. Here is a fixed diff.
I am curious about performance of smptimers. It seems that
webserver benchmark performance worsens with smptimers (Ingo version)
contrary to our expectations. Do you see this ? If so, could this
happen because -
1) Bouncing around of global_bh_lock cacheline by more cpus compared
to earlier timer implemenation ?
2) All per-cpu timers invoked from timer_bh running in one cpu ?
Do you see any other side-effects of smptimers ?
Also, did my PPC changes for smptimers work or you had to fix it ?
Thanks
