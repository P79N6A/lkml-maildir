If anyone's interested, I have a patch for the DAC960 driver
that makes it compile and (I THINK) work with the 2.4.20aa1
patch.
You can find it in my public archive in

It's had minimal testing.  Mark Wong at OSDL is using this patch
run some database workloads.  That should be a reasonable sanity
test for this patch.
