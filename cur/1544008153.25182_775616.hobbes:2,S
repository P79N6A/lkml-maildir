This is a rework of the previously posted set of patches.
Patch 1 is the user level patch to add the SPU events to the user
OProfile tool.  
Patch 2 is a kernel patch to do code clean up and restructuring to make
it easier to add the new SPU event profiling support.  This patch makes
no functional changes.
Patch 3 is a kernel patch to add the SPU event profiling support.
