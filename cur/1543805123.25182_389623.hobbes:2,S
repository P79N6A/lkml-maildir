Well, I am not sure why the smp_call_function_single() is not already
implemented for i386. I can see that the underlying function send_IPI_mask()
is there. It also looks like flush_tlb_others() is also selecting CPUs a subset
of CPUs. I am not a big enough expert on x86 to understand if there are gotchas
to watch for. Yet it would surprise me if this is radically different than on
x86_64 (em64t) which already has the call. Maybe someone can clarify this?

This is not so pretty, I agree. I rewrote the loop differently now.
