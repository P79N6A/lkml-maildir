Great, thanks.  That tells us all sorts of stuff about your setup.
For linux-scsi reference, Chase's /proc/slabinfo says:
scsi_cmd_cache    1547440 1547440    384   10    1 : tunables   54   27    8 : 
slabdata 154744 154744      0

It's compile-time configurable with CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT and boot-time
configurable with log_buf_len=n.
