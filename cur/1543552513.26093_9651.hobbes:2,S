Hi,
Sorry for my stupid question, but I haven't got idea what the problem can be,
and maybe you can help me. See the following fragment of C code:
videobuffer=mmap(0,MAX_VIDEO_PACKET_SIZE,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED,-1,0);
if (videobuffer==(void*)-1) {
	perror("mmap()");
	exit(1);
}
This will return with Invalid argument.
The nice this is that this code runs happyly with 2.4.x-pre kernels but not
with my 2.2.17 or 2.2.18pre15.
Maybe because of not page aligned size, so I modify my code:
I defined MAX_VIDEO_PACKET_SIZE to 4096 for testing (on PC page size is
4096 bytes, and getpagesize() returns with this as well, I checked).
The result is the same ! I don't understand what the problem can be ...
I tried with opening /dev/zero with O_RDWR mode than mapping that, but that
gave me the same result ;-(
I'm totally confused.
Can someone help, please ?
