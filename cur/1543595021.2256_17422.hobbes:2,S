    Initial draft of a helper which uses generic elements present in several

    I have included a sample implementation in the epic100 driver, to
    illustrate how these helpers may be used.  This should make it easier to
    implement support across 10/100 hardware which uses primarily an MII
    phy.
    Comments appreciated.
Can someone explain to me why we have ethtool and mii-tool? Can we
not extend ethtool for the mii-tool stuff, even if only at userland?
