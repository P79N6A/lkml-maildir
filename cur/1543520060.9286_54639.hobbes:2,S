Yes, but you will typically also need a memory barrier instruction,
won't you? I have seen figures (from a DEC/Compaq guy) for the cost of
an uncontended mutex lock+unlock over the Alpha generations, and it
looked to have stayed pretty constant relative to the typical IPC for
the processors. I suppose that as ll/sc has got cheaper, the memory
barriers have got more expensive.
