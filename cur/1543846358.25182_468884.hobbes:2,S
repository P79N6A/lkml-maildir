Matthias,
Thanks, I tried your config file on 2.6.18 and it works!
The first time I tried my command line was:
Command line: root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash initcall_debug 
console=ttyS0,115200n8 loglevel=7 video=nvidiafb:nomtrr
and it came up but no keyboard or mouse, I changed it too:
Command line: root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash
You mentioned you "saw some hangs", I assume with the current 
configuration your having no problems with stability?
Thanks again,
Wink
