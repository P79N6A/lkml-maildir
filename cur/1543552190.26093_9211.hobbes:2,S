I'm happy with that - still produces the required effect and removes bloat 
from kernel space. Also means it should be easy to revert to default behavior.
My original idea was basically a wrapper much like the way chroot works. 
Being able to lock things in some state that was more appropriate for the 
program in question. I know that when I set up named/bind on a 2.2 system I 
set up with a chroot environment, every time an interface changed state, we 
had to restart named so that it could re-bind to the addresses. Being able 
to lock the state of those addresses in some way would be brilliant, wether 
it's the default or not.
