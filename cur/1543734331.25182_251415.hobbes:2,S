BTW, it's not always O(30th of seconds): if we have to reprogram the PLLs
(someone else may have changed the hardware state, let's play safe), it can
take much longer.
People already complained about long switching times between different VCs
using the same video mode, due to reprogramming the PLL from scratch, just to
be safe no one else did something to the hardware state we don't know about.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
