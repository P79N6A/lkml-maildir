Now of course, after Ctrl-C'ing the growisofs session, a new
 attempt yielded this
[root@donkey tmpburn]# growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=myfile.iso
WARNING: /dev/hdc already carries isofs!

Then, ejecting the disc and trying again, it went through.

Only thing I note is that after reloading, the WARNING about
 disc already carrying isofs disappeared.
I guess my next move will be borrowing a Windows CD and
 installing it on my former RedHat 9 partition, then trying
 to burn DVDs from there...
