Ok, the problem is that because the ioctls are no longer i386-centric,
the layout of the tables has changed.
What used to be scancode e05e is now scancode 15e, basically all
scancodes beginning with e0 are now offset by just 100 hex.
getkeycodes/setkeycodes translates e05e to de, while the table needs 15e.

Ignore getkeycodes output, except for the 0x58-0x7f the output is not
correct anymore. (e000-e07f lines show entries for scancodes 0x80-0xff,
as they always did, though).

Use setkeycodes 15e 89

No, keycodes without e0 should be fine.
