Hi,
after using some services (like ssh) over a line which has intermittent
blackouts (dies off for a couple of seconds, sometimes a minute, then
recovers) with an overall outage of 30% (ping -c 450), I find I'd like
to tune the retransmission parameters so as to shorten the
retransmission interval. (using 2.2.10 there, 2.2.13 here)  
Regretfully, they (the corresponding sysctl) seem to not be documented
that good, if at all.
Any pointers appreciated.
