Also, the changesets at bk://typhoon.bkbits.net/autoget-2.5 add
functionality to kbuild to checkout needed files automatically, as the
build progresses -- no more 'bk get' needed...
I haven't kept it up to date, but I doubt it'd need many changes to work
with a recent kernel. It's currently BK/SCCS specific, but I do not
think it would be hard to make it work with other version control
systems, as long as make supports them.
Since you do so much in kbuild, I'd love some comments on it, if you
have time.
