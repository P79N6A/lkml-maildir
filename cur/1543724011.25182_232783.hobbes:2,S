The suspect patch would be bootsplash.

It's extremely unlikely that the system would actually feel faster with 
preemption on in -ck so I suspect a touch of placebo effect.

Possibly the updated bootsplash patch might help. Another user had 
instability which was tracked down to bootsplash. The staircase scheduler is 
virtually unchanged so if it is responsible (which I'd like to think isn't 
the case) then the problem will not go away.
Suggestions (in order of likelihood):
-Update to -ck5
-Disable bootsplash
-Reverse patch bootsplash
-Don't enable any funky config options like regparm, 4k stacks or different 
Hz
-Start backing out patches one by one from the last to the first till it 
goes away.
Keep us informed if you find the culprit please.
