Subject: [W1] ds1wm: testers please, msleep not udelay

I'm working on some patches to the one wire system I just need to
split them into small logical patches.  I don't have the hardware to
test this ds1wm change.  I wouldn't expect the delay here to be
critical, and on a handheld platform, I wouldn't think busywaiting for
such a long time to be a good idea.  I also wouldn't expect putting
off reading the battery status a timer tick to matter much, so why not
sleep?
So, if someone would try out the patch and report back or tell me why
it's wrong I would appreciate it.  If it looks good I'll submit the
patch with the rest of the one wire changes I'm working on.
