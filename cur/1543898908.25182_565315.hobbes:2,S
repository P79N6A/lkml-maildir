The "freezer ordering effects" only affect uninterruptible tasks.

The powermac need not be a good example due to the different code ordering
(it's run on one CPU only, which makes the probability of triggering a race
be quite low).

Well, obviously FUSE and the freezer don't play well together, but that's FUSE
who's late in the game (the freezer was here before). ;-)
If you give me some time, I'll see what can be done.
