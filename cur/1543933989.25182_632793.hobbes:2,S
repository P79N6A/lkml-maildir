Well, not exactly.  The support for different boot and image kernels has
only been merged recently, but we can use the current git to restore
2.6.24-rc6-mm1, for example.
The trick is to pass a little additional information in the image header
that can be used by the boot kernel to locate the entry point to the image
kernel and the image kernel's page tables.
