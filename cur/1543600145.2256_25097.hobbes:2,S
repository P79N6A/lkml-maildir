If I remember correctly, no such configuration was needed if the
CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY compilation flag was enabled. As I understand from
a cursory examination of the 2.2 source, Whenever packets were received and
were not meant for the local address, a check would be made if they meant for
one of the transparent-proxied connections (i.e., connections whose local
endpoint isn't local).
This is the kind of thing I need in Linux 2.4 too.
I'm still puzzled by the fact that this support simply disappeared between
2.2 and 2.4, and nobody seems to know why (or people who know why don't
reply).

Remember that the reverse proxy machine, the one faking connections with an
adjacent server (as if they are coming from the actual clients) also serves
as the the gateway for that server and needs to forward packets for it.
So I can't redirect *all* packets to local sockets, yet I also can't pick
specific IP addresses to redirect (unless I write some sort of hack to
modify the iptables tables dynamically as new non-local bind()s happen).
Not to mention that the standard redirect, which also rewrites the destination
address on the packet (if I remember correctly), isn't quite what I need when
I already have a socket bound to a non-local address.

You're right. But I started at the easier end :)
