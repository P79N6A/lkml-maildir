So this is in the way of removing the freezer ... but as we are not 
relying on doing any io other than suspend device operation, save state 
to ram, then later put device in low power mode for s3 and/or s4, and 
finally restore and resume to running.

So its not a flag in make_request, fine.

Can they allocate the memory in advance?  (Call them when we know we 
want to suspend, they make the allocations they will need; we later 
call them again to release the allocations).
If you need timers, you probably want some scheduling?

can you elabrate?   Note I was not asking resume-from-low power vs 
init-from-por.  We still get that distinction.
How do these drivers work today when we kexec?
The reason I'm asking is its hard to tell the first kernel what 
happened.  We can say "we powered off, and we were restarted", but it 
becomes much harder when each device may or may not have a driver in 
the save kernel if we have to differentate for each device if it was 
initialized and later quiesced by the jump kernel during save or never 
touched.  And we need to tell the resume from hybernate code "i touched 
it" "no i didn't" and "we resumed from s4" "no it was from s5".
This is why I've been proposing that we don't create the suspend image 
with devices in the low power state, but only in a quiesced state 
similar to the initial state.
I'm proposing a sequence like:
(1) start allocating pinned memory to reduce saved image size
(2) allocate and map blocks to save maximum image (we know how much ram 
is not in 1, so the max size)
(3) tell drivers we are going to suspend.   userspace is still running, 
swaping still active, etc.  now is the time to allocate memory to save 
device state.
(4) do what we want to slow down userspace making requests (ie run 
freezer today)
(5) call drivers while still scheduling with interrupts "save 
oppertunitiy".  From this point, any new request should be queued or 
the process put on a wait queue.
(6) suspend timers, turn off interrupts
(7) call drivers with interrupts off (final save)
(8) jump to other kernel to save the image
(9) call drivers to transition to low power
(10) finish operations to platform suspend on hybernate
(11) call drivers to resume, telling them if from suspend-to-ram or 
suspend-to-disk, possibly in two stages (interrupts off no scheduling 
and interrupts on scheduling allowed)
(12) unfreeze processes, kill the the thread holding the extra memroy 
used to reserve
So I'm asking what needs to happen in 9.  If we have to turn interrupts 
on and schedule, that's ok.  If the low power state is the initial 
state then fine.
Note that in 11, we could further differentate "from image restore in 
S4" and "from image restore in S5", and "from failed image save", but 
what needs to happen differently?
I'm guessing that the work that will take some time is seperating the 
go to low power from quiesce operations for snapshot, as it sounds like 
this is done with one driver call today?  Making this separation will 
give us our driver audit :-), but only if we decide on the requiements 
before the start.
