IIUC, not. But I'll check this in practice.

I've given an example why is this OK.
Shortly, because we need to reserve space only for the EOB marker of the 
*last* block (1 byte) and for the adler32 (4 bytes).
Look closer to the algorithm. It consists of 2 parts.
1. We reserve 12 bytes And compress as much as possible to the output 
buffer with Z_SYNC_FLUSH. Zlib produces:
| stream header | Block 1 (<header, 64 K, EOB>) |  -> more
| Block 2 (<header, 64 K, EOB>) | ... etc ... |    -> more
| Block N (<header, 64 K, EOB>) |                  -> more
| Last block (<header, 25K
Here zlib stops on, say 25 KiB because there is no more room for output.
2. We call zlib_deflate() with Z_FINISH and provide additional 12 bytes. 
  After zlib_deflate() has finished, the output stream is:
| stream header | Block 1 (<header, 64 K, EOB>) |  -> more
| Block 2 (<header, 64 K, EOB>) | ... etc ... |    -> more
| Block N (<header, 64 K, EOB>) |                  -> more
| Last block (<header, 25K, EOB>) | adler32 |
And all is OK.

Agreed :-)
