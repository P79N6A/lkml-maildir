Hi!
After several tests with lots of different kernels, and thanks to the help
of Hubert Mantel from SuSE, the following conclusion has been reached:
Emu10k1 SPDIF passthru with the kernel OSS driver works only if the kernel
option CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is set. If one of the other two related options
(CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G) is used instead, the sound card is
unable to "pass" AC3 streams "through" the SPDIF output; only PCM and
multi-channel sound gets to the amp/speakers.
Emu10k1 SPDIF passthru is especially important for users who play DVDs on
their Linux boxes with digital sound from a SBLive 5.1 card.
This bug is present since kernel 2.4.13 (kernel 2.4.12 and earlier
versions don't suffer from it), and it's still present in the lastest
kernel (2.4.18-rc4).
I did all the tests using both the OSS emu10k1 driver that comes with each
kernel, and the latest driver from Creative website (v0.18). The results
were always the same. So this bug does not depend on the driver version,
it depends solely on the kernel version. I guess this is a kernel issue
then. Something that changed on kernel 2.4.13 must be the cause of this
problem.
I hope I was able to make myself clear enough. :)
Regards,
Zé
