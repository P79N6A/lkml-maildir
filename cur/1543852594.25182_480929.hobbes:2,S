I have had "Invalid memory segment 0x4000000 - 0x4997fff" problem with
'-l' option _always_. Since my priority was on '-p' i did not spent time
on debugging this problem yet...
Maybe this "crashkerenl=X@Y" was the cause of my problem? Some platform
can not specify a location to load so that it is legal to only specify
"crashkernel=X" now. Is it possible '-l' code path still expect to
see Y?
Thanks,
