Subject: Athlon Gigabyte GA-7IX mainboard is unstable with 3Com ethernet-cards, partially solved

We use an AMD Athlon K7 processor with a Gigabyte GA-7IX mainboard.
During transferring about 100 MB over the network by NFS the system
locked totally (you could not ping it, the keyboard LEDs did not react,
you could not switch virtual consoles).
This was the case for both 3Com 3c900 Boomerang and 3Com 3c905C
Tornado ethernet cards using the 3c59x driver. We tried the kernels
2.2.12, 2.2.13 and 2.3.31 without success.
An SMC Ultra ISA ethernet card worked stable.
We thought the reason for the instability could be the bus-master DMA
feature of the network cards. So we patched the 3c59x driver (the
patch is appended at the bottom).
This patch disabled the bus-master DMA. The 3c900 Boomerang works
stable with it, the 3c905C Tornado does not work at all with the
patch.
The 3c90x driver provided by 3Com
(
http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/linuxdownload.htm
) shows
the same symptoms.
All 3Com-cards work stable on other mainboards.
