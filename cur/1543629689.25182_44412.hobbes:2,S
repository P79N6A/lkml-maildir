Hi,
I suggest trying 2.4.19-pre8 first. This has the fix for the deadlock that I'm
aware of in it. If that still doesn't work, then try and send me as much
information as the system will let you extract. What I'm most interested
in is:
 o State of the sockets (netstat -t on both client and server)
 o Values of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_[rw]mem and tcp_mem
 o Does the nbd client get stuck in the D state before or after any other
   processes doing I/O through nbd? This is useful as it tells me whether
   the problem is on a transmit or receive.
 o Was your system low on memory at the time ?
 o Were you trying to use nbd as a swap device ?
Steve.
