I have no clue in this area either, unfortunately.

You mean the bonding driver ? Older versions did not support ethtool ioctl(),
but only MII calls. I don't remember at what version it changed, but I suspect
from what you're saying that your driver might work if you disable ethtool.
Take a look at the bonding driver, there's a place where it first tries if
ethtool is supported on the driver, and if not it uses MII. I think that
commenting out one "if" statement would be close to enough.

There's always hope, you have all the code :-)
