Hi Stephen,
please add:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git  next
This contains a subset of the patches in the ext4 patch set which we
are explicitly planning on pushing to Linus at the next merge window.
It actually probably wouldn't hurt to pull the entire quilt series
into linux-next, since we don't export any interfaces that are used by
other linux trees, and that would give us better heads up for
conflicts in patches still in development conflicting with upcoming
core changes.  But it conflicts with the initial premise of
linux-next, so that's why I set up the next branch of the above git
tree.
Regards,
