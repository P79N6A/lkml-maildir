You don't need to reinstall when the disk is not cleanly unmounted, any more
than you reinstall a windows machine because it might have an error on the disk.
Fsck is run automatically on unclean boots to check the file system over and
fix any clear problems (its the Linux equivalent of chkdsk). For some cases
where there might be data loss it won't do the fix but will instead drop you
into a single user shell where you can run fsck by hand and say yes/no to
the things it is doing.
