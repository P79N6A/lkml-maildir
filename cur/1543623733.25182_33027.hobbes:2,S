Bloody hell...  14 is EFAULT.  And that - from sys_mount() called by
task that has KERNEL_DS as addr_limit.  What options do you pass to kernel
and what filesystems are compiled in?  Actually, adding printk("%s\n", p);
in the same place might give some hints...
Basically, sys_mount() is called in conditions when -EFAULT should not
be generated at all - it is handled on a pretty low level and AFAICS
that area hadn't been changed between -pre2 and -pre3.  Weird...
