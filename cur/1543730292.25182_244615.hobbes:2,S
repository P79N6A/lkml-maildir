I applied this to 2.6.8.1 and most of -mm4's patches - it applied
cleanly and compiled fine.
I use devicemapper to stripe two 80gb sata drives on intel sata
controller, using initramfs.
Now when I boot, I see something like:
---
BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 2 devices found
Freeing unused kernel memory: 264k freed
inotify device opened
dm ioctl error or such
---
Which then results in a panic as the dm volumes cannot be setup
and no / found by kernel.  So basically it seems like inotify
mess with dm in some way or other - any quick ideas what it
could be?
I do not have serial console, so if you need a more complete log,
just let me know from where abouts I should start, and if any
debugging should be turned on, etc.
Thanks,
