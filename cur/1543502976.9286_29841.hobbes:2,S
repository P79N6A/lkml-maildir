Hello from Xi Graphics..
I just read this letter (I was off the list when it came out, Jul 5th)..

A nice little abstraction is merely to consider the AGP-GART "aperture" to be
a type of graphics-buffer memory "device."  It just happens to be filled 
with pages taken from main memory.  The AGP bridge allows retrieval of the 
data at the AGP card's leisure.

We're using the GART now and have been for about 10 months or so for our 
in-developement 3D server.
Essentially that GART allows a big swath of "CPU/AGP shared-memory" to be 
created (for use by AGP cards) from a normal list of free physical memory 
pages.  It's like the AGP bridge is a "virtual process" with its own 
virtual-page table... sharing a segment of memory that it owns.
This has obvious advantages when getting long lengths of physical 
memory is difficult.  3D already requires vast amounts of storage to flow 
into the engine.  Main memory also is a very fast destination for the CPU to 
write to and yet remain asynchronous with the AGP 3D card.  Exploiting main 
memory as a huge/fast funnel for CPU output, is the idea.
We're preparing to release a simple driver-patch/module built to be used
in our new X server, for R&D.  We've been using a small, straightforward one 
for our development work, and we haven't seen any real discussion of direct 
AGP-bridge support.
We are prepared to support later kernel versions (for our EV2+ 3D X server) 
with some simple binary modules sent along with the server... but would much 
prefer that the AGP/GART be supported in a standard kernel.

-From what Herr Thomas (Thomas Roell) says, this is not true... it just has 
to be memory reached within the GART table "window".

I've no clue how it occurs there.  It might be interesting to know how they
deal with the security/stability issues.  Client-side rendering is the big 
New Thing (scales with SMP) and so much CPU is needed along with the 3D 
rendering.. it has to be done outside of a central server context, even with 
a multithreaded one.  
Is it that this doesn't present new problems, that aren't already dealt with 
elsewhere on NT?  (i.e. failing processes botch the graphics engine or mess 
up the card or main X server)
> So I was just looking for people who may have already touched on it.
It's such a narrow focus, mostly for 3d graphics cards.  Not many folks will
mention it as a priority.  Still, we must use the hardware to its utmost.

Exactement.  The CPU can handle the not-so-trivial task of assembling
the proper set of textures and command buffers for execution.

When it's replaced, we'll see.  It doesn't really matter because 3D still 
requires alot of accesses local to the card's side (in the framebuffer, 
depth buffer etc..), so the AGP bus isn't the slowest part of the process.

I may not be the best one to know, but I feel that any means of 3D that 
takes over the CPU entirely will not be the best way to effectively keep the 
screen updated.  SMP can do alot, but the tasks that are specific to the 3D 
space of calculations are very specialized and relate to a user-viewed 
output device, merely attempting to get the highest constant frame rate.  
At times, the frames should even remain separated by a realtime delay.
I would guess these tasks are not easily mixable with a sensible list of 
user tasks and constantly pre-emptive multitasking.
