generic_batch_write works with the page cache, another batch_write 
implementation may not.
Except the cached_page and pagevec which are generic_batch_write 
context, the batch_write switch leaves file stuff _before_ the switch 
and using of the page cache _after_ the switch.  It gives much 
flexibility to a file system to choose between simple page cache 
buffered write, batch version of page cache write or even not a 
page-oriented write method like reiser4 write method for packed (tails 
only) files.  address space op which does not use the page cache looks 
better as a file op.
