I'll have to dig out the specs for this chipset to double check a
reconfigure is enough (or even needed).  Does this patch definitly make
a difference to you on resume ?

That wouldn't be using AGP anyway. The only difference this could make
would be if you were using 3D applications.

If bridge->driver _isn't_ ati_generic_bridge, I don't think we can
ever get here, so you can probably just make this unconditional.
