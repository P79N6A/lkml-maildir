Hi Peter,
   sorry for the delay, here's my report. I got the qemu linux image from the
   qemu website and did the following:
[boris@gollum:10:34:25:qemu:9553)->  qemu -kernel /boot/2.6.22-4fd06960f120e02e9abc802a09f9511c400042a5-12 -append "root=/dev/hda" linux-0.2.img
and the kernel did boot just fine so the problem should be pertaining only to the
case when we boot on the bare hardware...
