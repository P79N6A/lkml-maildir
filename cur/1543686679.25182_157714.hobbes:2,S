In this case you're throttling the cpu frequency. This affects the
frequency the TSC updates, which makes it very hard to use the TSC as a
timesource (the cpu_freq notifier tries to compensate by changing the
tsc multiplier but my systems don't have cpu_freq drivers, so I've not
seen it work).

If you're losing interrupts and the lost-tick detection code is not
compensating, shifting back to HZ=100 just tries to minimize the
problem.

Do these problems still show when you're not using the amd76x_pm?

Well, depending on how ntp is compiled, it could use stime, rather then
settimeofday. This causes ntp to set the time on average .5 seconds off
the desired time. Since .5 is outside the .128 sec slew boundary, ntp 
will do another step adjustment which has the same poor accuracy. This
results in ntp just hopping back and forth around the desired time.
