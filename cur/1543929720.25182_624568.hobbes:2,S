Yes, but as driver_private is not known by any driver, I don't think
this patch will work at all.

What are you trying to do here?  The driver core already sets up this
symlink for you automatically, why are you createing yet-another-link
with a different name?  This should just be removed entirely, it's not
needed at all.
So, to fix the build properly, just delete the sysfs_create_link() call
entirely.
