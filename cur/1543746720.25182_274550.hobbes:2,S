2 is simple: LRU doesn't change because everything that would change it
is frozen, and the memory pool hooks ensure that scanning of the list
doesn't happen while suspending either.
I don't see the point to saving LRU pages separately when you're still
eating all the memory you can. You'll have the same number of pages to
save, just fewer to copy (and copying takes far less time than saving).

Pavel's going to think you are trying to turn swsusp into suspend2!!
