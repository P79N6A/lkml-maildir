It's task_truct colouring not stack, to colour the stack you've to go in
arch/??/kernel/process.c and jitter the stack pointer.
The task_struct colouring is done at task_struct creation time :
+struct task_struct *alloc_task_struct(void)
+{
+       unsigned long tskb = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL, 1), tsk;
+       tsk = tskb | ((tskb >> 13) & 0x00000060) | SMP_CACHE_BYTES;
+       *(unsigned long *) tskb = tsk;
+       return (struct task_struct *) tsk;
+}
