Releasing "early and often" was never an excuse to release buggy code.
It is (to me, at least) about adding functionalities one at a time,
rather than waiting to be full-featured before releasing first.
As for the "later", there are areas where it is known not to work, e.g.
documentation - or more generally, everything which is optional from a
functional point of view. I do expect functional bugs to be fixed
later when they bite the users, but I am more skeptical about cleanups
and documentation.
