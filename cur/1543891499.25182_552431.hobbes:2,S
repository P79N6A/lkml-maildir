Sorry, FYI, I made the same mistake as when I reported the wol problem - I was
booting 2.6.21.1.
I am having problems with 2.6.22-rc3 but when it does suspend/resume I can
confirm that the problem is still there (of course).
However your comments still stand.
One unpleasant side effect is that I get
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
...
and
hdb: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
hdb: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
...
when the system comes back (induced from smartd I guess) until I do a:
 smartctl -son
