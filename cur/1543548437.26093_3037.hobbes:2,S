Life really sucks.  It's like losing a superblock, sort of.  We can 
reconstruct them but almost never do because people typically have 
more than once copy of a repository sitting around.  So you can copy
it back, do a "bk -r check -a" (the moral equiv of an fsck, no we don't
really have an fsck -y yet), and fix up the errors.  The revision control
files and the ChangeSet files point at each other and need to be in sync.
That's how we get all the performance, by the way, all we need to compare
is a tiny subset of the ChangeSet files (32KB out of 5MB in one tree, that's
pretty typical).  And we could compare a lot less, it just hasn't been
worth it to do so, we gzip that 32K down to less than 6K so...)
