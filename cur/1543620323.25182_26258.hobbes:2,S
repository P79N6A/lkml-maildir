Yes. The problem is that Linux/Alan/Marcelo or who ever maintains proper
kernel trees aren't interested - the /usr/src/linux/patches stuff is only on
the way for them. (Although they could easily rm -rf /usr/src/linux/patches
before making a release if they please.)
This idea is mostly applicable to external patches not ment for inclusion
(yet).
Maybe if there was a well-defined framework, we could persuade some of the
most influential patch maintainers (Rik van Riel, Robert Love, Andre Hedrick
etc..) use it. Then maybe, big maybe, it might catch fire.
