Subject: Why INSTALL_PATH is not /boot by default?

This line, in the main Makefile, is commented:
export  INSTALL_PATH=/boot
Why? It seems pointless, since almost everything has been for ages requiring 
this settings, and distros' versions of installkernel have been taking an 
empty INSTALL_PATH as meaning /boot for ages (for instance Mandrake). It's 
maybe even mandated by the FHS (dunno).
Is there any reason I'm missing?
