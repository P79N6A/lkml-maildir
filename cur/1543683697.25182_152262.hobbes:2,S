Hi,
I'm trying to get rivafb working with a GeForce 4 MX 440 and
2.6.0-test2. The penguin logo and the cursor are displayed correctly,
but the rest of the screen is garbage (I assume I can find a more
verbose graphical description for the garbage if it is helpful :)).
The original problem was encountered on a UP kernel running ACPI, local
APIC and MTRR support, but removing these features didn't help.
This is what rivafb has to say:
rivafb: nVidia device/chipset 10DE0171
rivafb: Detected CRTC controller 0 being used
rivafb: PCI nVidia NV20 framebuffer ver 0.9.5b (nVidiaGeForce4-M, 64MB @ 0xD0000000)
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30
with MTRR enabled, it's:
rivafb: nVidia device/chipset 10DE0171
rivafb: Detected CRTC controller 0 being used
rivafb: RIVA MTRR set to ON
rivafb: PCI nVidia NV20 framebuffer ver 0.9.5b (nVidiaGeForce4-M, 64MB @ 0xD0000000)
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30
but gives the same result. Is this supposed to work? 
ciao,
