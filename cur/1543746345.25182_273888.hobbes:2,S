If 'a' could be signed on some architectures and unsigned on others, 
then I agree that "a < 0" is not silly.  But if it's always going to be 
unsigned, then I can't see how it's not silly.

Wouldn't something like "sizeof(pid_t) > 2" be a better test?  It 
certainly would be a lot easier to understand than comparing with 0xffff.
