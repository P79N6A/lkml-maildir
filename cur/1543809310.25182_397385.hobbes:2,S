Subject: [RFC] sys_setrlimit() in 2.6.16
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A test suite uncovered a possible bug in setrlimit(2), in 2.6.16-rc3.
A code that does
        mylimits.rlim_cur = 0;
        setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU, &mylimits);
does not set a cpu time limit.
No signal is sent to this code when its "limit" of 0 seconds expires.
Whereas, under the 2.6.5 kernel (SuSE SLESS9) a signal was sent.
I don't see any obvious difference in sys_setrlimit() or
set_process_cpu_timer() between 2.6.5 and 2.6.16.
Is this a correction, or a bug?
Is a cpu time limit of 0 supposed to limit a task to 0 seconds, or
leave it unlimited?
