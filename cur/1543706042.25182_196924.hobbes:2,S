It would be better to lose the sysctl and do it all dynamically.
Options are:
a) realloc the bitmap when it fills up
   Simple, a bit crufty, doesn't release memory.
b) lib/radix-tree.c
   Each entry in the radix tree can be a bitmap (radix-tree.c should
   have been defined to store unsigned longs, not void*'s.  Oh well), so
   you get good space utilisation, but finding a new entry will take ten or
   so lines of code.
c) lib/idr.c
   Worst space utilisation, but simplest code.
I'd go with c), personally.
