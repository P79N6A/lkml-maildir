Miscommunication and lack of clarity.  CPU reads and writes _are_ 
guaranteed to be atomic.  What is not guaranteed is that the compiler 
will generate a single read or write instruction corresponding to a 
particular expression in C.
Consider a routine like the following:
	static task_struct *the_task;
	void store_task(void)
	{
		the_task = current;
	}
Is it possible to say whether readers examining "the_task" are 
guaranteed to see a coherent value?
