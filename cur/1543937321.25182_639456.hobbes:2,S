I got more interesting result :)
MAP_POPULATE is harmful result at large copy.
1G copy
                             elapse(sec)
--------------------------------------------
mmap                          71.54
mmap + madvice                69.63
mmap + populate              100.87
mmap + populate + madvice    101.16
more detail:
time command output of mmap copy
	0.50user 3.59system 1:11.54elapsed 5%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k

input blocks increase about x2.
in fact, mmap(MAP_POPULATE) read disk to memory and drop it just after,
thus read again. 
of cource, when copy file size is enough small, MAP_POPULATE is effective.
100M copy
                             elapse(sec)
--------------------------------------------
mmap                          7.38
mmap + madvice                7.29
mmap + populate               7.13
mmap + populate + madvice     6.65
