Subject: I can kill 2.2.1 stone dead with my zip drive

I can kill 2.2.1ac5 stone dead by building parport as a module (so
plug-n-pray autoprobe also has to be a module), and the ppa zip driver
as a module.  I simply tar a lot of stuff to the zip drive and when it
gets full, I get a kernel panic "unable to sync" and the machine locks
hard.  In one evening I got three of these.  Two of them the machine
was stone dead.  On one occasion I was able to change vterms, so I did
"alt-sysrq S" It synced the first three drives and then died trying to
sync the zip drive.  When I fsck the offending disk, it has loads of
errors.  If it makes any difference, its a ext2 zip disk with a single
partition and SMP kernel.
I'm sorry I can't spare the time to do a full test against vanilla
2.2.1,  and debug it further etc, but I'm currently in the midst of
"OMIGOD we're way behind our shipping date with no stable product in
sight" headless chicken pre-release madness.
Perhaps some other folks with zip drives on non-critical boxes would
like to try this.  In particular, I guess it would be good to try this
on:
1)UP
2)vanilla 2.2.1
3)non-ext2 zip disk
Please sync up your disks first.
