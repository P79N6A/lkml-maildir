Could you please send a patch that doesnt change the code, only adds a 
'boot APIC version' kind of variable as an apic_version __read_mostly 
variable and does a WARN_ONCE() if that mismatches? We can then stick that 
into -tip and see whether it triggers.
The max array size is ~128K, right? So if the WARN_ONCE() does not 
trigger, we can just drop the array and use the central apic_version 
variable ...
And even if it _does_ trigger, the version incompatibilities between APIC 
protocols are very rare. They only happen across wildly different CPU 
architectures like when going from very old external apics to integrated 
apics, or going from apics to x-apics. We wont see any mixing across those 
boundaries.
