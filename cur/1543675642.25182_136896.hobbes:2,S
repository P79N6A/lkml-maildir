A fully-functioning ide-scsi is extremely important. The application 
cdrecord and its derivatives require a SCSI interface to work. I don't 
know of any other CD-R/RW recording application in common use on Linux. 
Many distributions add ide-scsi boot parameters when they discover an 
IDE CD-R drive. Even though the newest development versions of cdrecord 
along with the newest versions of kernel 2.5 do not require ide-scsi, 
the installed base is enormous. This will represent a significant 
barrier to widespread adoption of 2.6 if currently installed versions of 
cdrecord with currently configured boot parameters must be updated.
