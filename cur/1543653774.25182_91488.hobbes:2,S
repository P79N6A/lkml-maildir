dear list,
i have an A7M266-D board with two AMD Athlon MP 2000+ on it.
Unfortunately I am unable to compile the correct driver for the AM7441 
IDE Controller (using 2.4.19)
I always get this under SuSE :
AMD7441: detected chipset, but driver not compiled in!
When using a precompiled SUSE or RedHat Kernel it gets recognized.
SuSE Linux 2.4.18-64GB-SMP output :
AMD_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
AMD_IDE: chipset revision 4
AMD_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
AMD_IDE: AMD-768 Opus (rev 04) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
RedHat 2.4.18-14smp output :
AMD7441: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
AMD7441: chipset revision 4
AMD7441: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
AMD7441: disabling single-word DMA support (revision < C4)
     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
What am I doing wrong ? and why RedHat and SuSE Kernel have no Problem 
with this Chipset ?
best regards,
Jan
