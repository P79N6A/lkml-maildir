And it looks like it wants to be able to sleep.
I lied about ->releasepage being nonblocking.  try_to_free_buffers()
is nonblocking, and for a while, ->releasepage had to be nonblocking.
But we can relax that now.  I'll put the gfp_flags back into
page reclaim's call to try_to_release_page().  That might help XFS
to play nice with the VM.
