Any time your trying to make a caller "happy" by adjusting
a return value forcefully, it's a hack.
And I stated this in another reply about this issue.
Please do not fix the problem this way.
The correct way to fix this is, if we did process a full
"weight" or work, we should not netif_rx_complete() and
we should not re-enable chip interrupts.
Instead we should return the true "work_done" value and
allow the caller to thus poll us one more time.
