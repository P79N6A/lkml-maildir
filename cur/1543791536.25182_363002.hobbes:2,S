Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Core Features Fixed
- Per drive tuning
- Filter quirk lists
- Single channel support
And To Add
- Specify PCI bus speed
- HPA
- IRQ mask
- PIO only LBA48
- Serialize
- CRC downspeed
- Mixed legacy/native mode (most work done)
Drivers so far written for the libata parallel work I'm doing
ALI
Driver written with equivalent support to the drivers/ide one. Needs
core changes for LBA48 PIO only
AMD
Driver written, given basic testing and equivalent to current
drivers/ide
CS5520
Driver written, some debug work to do. Works unlike the drivers/ide one
CS5530
Works single channel needs core changes for dual
CS5535
Written but untested
HPT34X
Driver written, functionality same as drivers/ide. Needs more testing.
HPT36x
Support done for chips up to 302. No 372N/302N or PLL support yet
IT821x
Written but needs further driver and core work yet
RZ1000
Written, simulation tested
SC1200
Written, needs core changes for dual channel
Serverworks
Written, equivalent functionality to drivers/ide plus some bugs fixed
SIL680
Written, tested, running. 
Triflex
Written tested, running
VIA
Written, tested on some controllers. Does not yet support the 6410 (TODO
item) and very early VIA (needs core changes)
'Generic'
Written, tested, needs polishing and some core changes ideally for irq
mask and for simplex
ISA Legacy
Work in progress
---------------
Unsupported Hardware
ACPI
TODO item - it's possible to drive unknown motherboard chipsets through
ACPI. Not supported by drivers/ide either
AEC62xx
ATIIXP
CMD64x
CY82C693
IT8172
NS87415
OPTI621
PDC202xx
SGI IOC4
SIS5513
SL82C105
SLC90E66
TRM290
PCMCIA (needs hotplug merge first)
