It is easier to apply 2.6.20.2 on top of 2.6.20+RSDL. The .2 patch
is a one-liner that you can easily fix by hand, and I'm not even
certain that it is still required :
--- ./kernel/sched.c.orig	2007-03-10 13:03:51 +0100
+++ ./kernel/sched.c	2007-03-10 13:08:02 +0100

 		next = list_entry(queue->next, struct task_struct, run_list);
 	}
 
-	if (dependent_sleeper(cpu, rq, next))
+	if (rq->nr_running == 1 && dependent_sleeper(cpu, rq, next))
 		next = rq->idle;
 switch_tasks:
 	if (next == rq->idle)
BTW, Con, I think that you should base your work on 2.6.20.[23] and not
2.6.20 next time, due to this conflict. It will get wider adoption.

Willy
