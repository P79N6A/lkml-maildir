I would expect any distribution should work on these (as long as the
kernel they use isn't too old.).  Of course if it is a Mac, you need a
distribution that supports their firmware (which is of course not a PC
bios).  As long as you can boot it, any i386 or amd64 kernel with smp
enabled should use all the processors present (well amd64 on the
core2duo and on the p4 if it is em64t enabled).
I believe the closest optimization for a Core2 is probably the Pentium M
(certainly not the P4/netburst).  Not entirely sure though.
