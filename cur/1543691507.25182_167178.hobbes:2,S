Hello,
Just in case you have a similar problem.
The possible reason is that the on-board Inter 1000 chip of Dell PowerEdge
1600SC is Intel 82540EM, which is running PCI 32/33 or PCI 32/66.

Hello,
I am sending UDP data from one PC to another PC directly through a cross
cable. The NIC of sender is Intel® PRO/1000 MT Server Adapter, and the NIC
of receiver is on-board Intel PRO/1000 (Dell PowerEdge 1600SC).
After tuning the kernel and driver parameters, the sender can send data at
1Gbps. But the receiver can only receive data at 620Mbps. (see the following
ifconfig messages, 30 seconds test)

***************************************************
My questions is why so many packets are "errors, dropped, overruns". I have
adjusted the "TxDescriptors, RxDescriptors, RxIntDelay,
RxAbsIntDelay, TxIntDelay, TxAbsIntDelay" for different values, but always
got similar result.
Maybe here is not the right email list to send, but I am really frustrated
with this problems, and hope to get some suggestions from the experts
here.Any suggestion is really appreciated!
