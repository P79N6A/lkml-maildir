Because a tweak is different from an IV. There can be an arbitrary
number of tweaks. For instance, EME takes 1 tweak per 512 bytes. If you
have a 4k page to encrypt, you have to process 8 tweaks of whatever
size. 
 Therefore, you need 3 scatterlists: src, dst and the running along
tweak.
However, I don't want to limit the discussion to the specific needs of
LRW or EME. I wanted to write something nice and generic for other
people to use, thus scatterwalk_walk. 
There must be a solution to get an arbitrary number of kmappings in
softirq problem. If it's possible for 2 pages, I can't see a reason why
this ain't possible for more. The use of scratch buffers and constant
switching of kmap_atomic mapping is just ridiculously stupid.

That's only partially correct. The tweak value _is_ the location on
disk. The value which is XORed twice is computed from the tweak and the
secondary key. In LRW, you need a tweak value per block. So, if you
encode 256 blocks, you need 256 tweaks. That's what the additional
scatterlist is for.

Frankly, I don't see a point escalating this discussion. It must be
possible to process more than 2 mappings in softirq context. If not, I
feel emotionally offended.
