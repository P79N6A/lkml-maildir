Thanks. In the dump we can see that connections reusing ports
always have their first SYN dropped and retransmissted three
seconds later. I'm not sure whats causing this yet, do you have
any firewall rules that affect loopback traffic?
This filter (wireshark) shows one example of the problem in case
someone else wants to have a look:
(tcp.dstport == 1017 || tcp.srcport == 1017) && (tcp.flags == 0x02)
