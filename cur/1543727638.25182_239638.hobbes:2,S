Yes, it's wrong in current Linux 2.6. It currently defines inline to
inline __attribute__((always_inline))

Exactly.
Originally it was used this way, but then the inlining algorithms got
completely broken to not explode compile times on broken C++ template
horrors, and in order to still compile the kernel most uses of extern
inline were converted to static inline.
Drawback is that you suddenly got a lot of binary bloat
(e.g. at some point gcc decided to not inline anymore 
the constant evaluation code in copy_{to,from}_user,
which caused incredibly code bloat).
That is when the #define inline __attribute__((always_inline)) was
added.

That was the original intention I think, but Linux always has used
it for the first interpretation.
It's pretty obsolete now, modern gcc has __attribute__((always_inline)),
which is a better way to do this. You get a compiler error when 
the function cannot inlined. It also has a __attribute__((noinline))
for the opposite case.
Hope this helps,
