If it's run fron an initrd, it'll fall back automatically.  Also you can set
the name of the resume partition in the header file swsusp.h and
you'll be able to use the tools without any command line
parameters (useful if you want to start resume from an initrd).
Besides, an -mm kernel is needed for this to work (preferrably
2.6.16-rc1-mm5, for now), and the CVS changes on a daily basis.
