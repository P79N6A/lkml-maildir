I think you're confused.  If you read 
http://gcc.cygnus.com/,
``In April 1999, the egcs steering committee was appointed by the FSF as
the official GNU maintainer for GCC.''
and reading further down, you will notice:
September 3, 1999 
	Long time GCC contributors Mark Mitchell and Richard Kenner
	have been given global write permissions. They are authorized
	to install and approve patches to any part of the compiler.
	Richard Kenner will initially be working on merging in the
	remaining changes from the old GCC 2 sources.
If my memory serves me, egcs is based on a gcc 2 snapshot from about
9 months ago.
The observations are correct though, the generated code is superior and
it has a different set of bugs.
