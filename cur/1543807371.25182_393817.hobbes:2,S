I think this boundary is blurred by the fact that several partition  
tables allow mostly-arbitrary partition type strings.  It would be  
convenient to not have to worry about the prefix in that case.  You  
would need just the partition type in the parent device anyways, so  
why munge it into the partition label too?

Nonono, not _just_ partition-type based autodetect, but a more  
complicated solution done _completely_ in userspace.  Essentially, by  
exporting this data you would merely be providing _extra_ pieces of  
data that could be verified on boot.  If I know that my boot RAID  
volumes for my desktop always have a partition table type string of  
"Linux_RAID_<unique-id>", then I can _also_ verify that in my  
initramdisk.  This isn't as useful on x86, but that's no reason to  
prevent it from being used on archs that do allow 31+ character  
strings for partition types.

This is one way of doing that on a systems with mac partition  
tables.  The autoprobing is mostly useless on x86 hardware due to the  
limited range of partition types, but that's x86's problem.
