As I posted here last week, it's trivial to put the IDE drives into
standby mode just before powerdown instead. It has the same effect
and it would take just a few lines of code.
The Debian /sbin/halt does this now just before it asks the kernel
to poweroff, and it fixes this problem just fine. It would be better
if the kernel did it though.
Mike.
