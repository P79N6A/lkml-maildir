VAX: There are folks working on this. VAX is very CISC but of course the
gnu compilers at least used to work very well on it.

The AS/400 is more like a toaster than a computer. They take an interesting
approach of implementing a protected machine via software 'trust'. The
compiler generates apps that are written in an interpreted layer and have
been validated to some extent. The code is then executed JIT style with
trust checks in the code. The real hardware is much akin to an MMUless 386.
You'd almost want to bootstrap the system with a JVM on the hardware and 
use the gcc compile into java byte code target to build your system.
