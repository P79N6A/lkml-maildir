By the way, since this is of general interest...
I asked the POSIX people if there was anything in the Austin (Unix 2002)
draft that would prohibit this behaviour.  The response was more or less
of the form "we are not really sure if it's within the spec, but it is
perfectly reasonable."  The (only) issue seems to be whether or not the
requirement to deliver ENOTDIR in cases like this is absolute or if this
is a permissible extension.  The way I interpret what I got back was
pretty much "go for it and don't worry about it."
