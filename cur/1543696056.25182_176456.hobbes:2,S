Question: is it normal for ipv6 module to have many refs while there is few 
ipv6 connections ?
My system is up for 3 days now. I have been using ACPI sleep and _ifconfig to 
alter the ip address_. 
lsmod gives:
	ipv6                  235904  34
and lsof -i6 only shows two ports listening on ipv6.
Even when I close all tcp (including v4) sockets, ipv6 still has around 10 
refs in lsmod.
Ten days ago (with -test7) I used to have a broken script for sshd that tried 
to bind to ipv6 every 20 mins. The result was that the count for ipv6.ko 
would reach as high as 900 w/o any bound sockets.
Does that constitute a leak? 
In other news, I haven't managed to trace the bug behind 'lockd', but I guess 
it's time I ask about it. After about 4 days uptime [1], both in -test7 and 
-test9, lockd BUGs at 'module.h, 296' . After that, nfs becomes unusable[2] 
and I have to reboot the kernel. The BUG is hit while I try to mount a nfs 
partition, which is being served by another 2.6 machine [3].
I can only report that this has happened. It may be related to the ipv6 leak, 
I guess..
[1] Every day, I switch from my home net to my work's net and back. I use 
ifconfig new_ip for that.
[2] lockd freezes, the 'mount' process gets <defunct> and nfs cannot be 
unloaded.
[3] At work, I mount nfs partitions to a *nix environment. I have not yet seen 
lockd freeze there.
