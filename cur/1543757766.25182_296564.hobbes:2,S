That matches my experience, at least as far as the "no problem" part, I 
never tried without -pad because it just seemed as if cdrecord would 
have a better idea of what the drive wanted than I do.
I have burned tarballs, as well as cpio (I like the checking with -Hcrc 
and not overwriting newer versions of a file), and more recently I have 
been burning encrypted filesystem images onto DVDs directly, and that 
works as well.
