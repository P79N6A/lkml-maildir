Links on kernels should lead to full kernels, not patches. Oh, you can't
imagine how many people download the patches and then ask around what
went wrong. I know, rtfm, but that's not the point when everything can
be better with a slight change.
Rsync is no longer supported, why is it still there?
The rest is great:>
