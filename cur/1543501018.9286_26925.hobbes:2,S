This sounds interesting.. So only an VFS implementaton of
webdav is missing..  Well, maybe when I have time again I will
start one..
The only thing I don't like in podfuk is the fact that I don't like
the syntax.. I would better like something where I can e.g. say
usermount -T davfs 
http://foo.bar/
 /mnt/foo
And the underlying user FS would then load the given library (davfs)
and implement the filesystem operations through a standardized interface
with that library..
Anyway, that's maybe not the topic of this list...
Well, thanks for your answers,
Christian
