Does not seem easy to reproduce, it looks like some resource pools are
kept pre-allocated after a first run, because if I kill scheddos during
the ramp up then start it again, it can go further. The problem happens
when the parent is forking. Also, I modified scheddos to close(0,1,2)
and to perform the forks itself and it does not cause any problem, even
with 4000 processes running. So I really suspect that the problem I
encountered above was tty-related.
BTW, I've tried your fork patch. It definitely helps forking because it
takes below one second to create 4000 processes, then the load slowly
increases. As you said, the children have to earn their share, and I
find that it makes it easier to conserve control of the whole system's
stability.
