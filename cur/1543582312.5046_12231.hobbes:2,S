We're using nr_async_pages to calculate the number of pages which should
be flushed, but nr_async_pages counts on flight swap _readaheads_ (each
swapin increases nr_async_pages by (1 << page_cluster)) and writes, not
only writes.
That makes the "pageout free shortage and sleep" kswapd behaviour you
wanted a bit messy.
