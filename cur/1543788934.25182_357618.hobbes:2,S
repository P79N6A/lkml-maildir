Maybe, but either we make it ready for future needs now, or we only
support current needs and allow a clear upgrade path.
Ignoring fields which might later have a meaning is bad because it
means that user-space code which works now much break later for no
good reason.  
My basic position wrt this is that if the fields are there, they
should be checked.

Uhmmmm.... that code fragment isn't in the patch you sent.  I got:

I guess if you merged these two, you might get something usable..

Ok, I guess I presented by difficulty with this rather badly.  The
order does seem arbitrary and non-obvious, but you are right that
other things are no-obvious too...
The point I should have made was that it is non-extensible. 
Suppose NFSv4.4 is defined to work over SCTP to even DCCP (which might
be ideal for NFS), how would we specify those?

Yes... but I'm not sure of the rest of the rules about defaults...
- should you need to explicitly remove the defaults if you don't want
  them?
- should there be an easy way to revert-to-defaults?  Maybe when the
  last nfsd dies, all setting are forgotten (just like currently all
  exports are removed).

I don't see why it would break backwards compat.  Isn't that exactly
what the nfssvc syscall does?  You give it a port number, and it
starts the number of threads with two sockets, a udp bound to ADDR_ANY
and the given port, and a TCP bound the same way?  What is what I
meant to say above.

I think the principle of "do as much as possible in user-space" is a
good one. 
   socket / bind / pmap_register 
can all be done in user-space, so maybe they should be.
You could possible even argue that 
   listen / accept
the be done in user-space, and so should be, but I'm not sure I want
to push it that far.
The nice thing about just passing down a filedescriptor for a socket
is that it allows for any future additions of protocols.
I don't see how permissions could be a problem, but then I know very
little about selinux, so maybe there is something.  Is there something
specific you foresee, or is it just general concern?
