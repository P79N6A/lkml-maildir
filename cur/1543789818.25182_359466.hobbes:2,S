I've been asked to look at kexec for ppc on 2.6.10.  The syscall appears 
to be present, but there seem to be additional patches for 2.6.10-mm at:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
Are these patches needed?
I haven't been able to find any current official documentation, although 
I found some old stuff from 2.5 and a writeup at:
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-kexec.html?ca=dgr-lnxw04RebootFast
Is there any official HOWTO on this?  Any issues I should look at in 
particular?
Thanks for any pointers,
Chris
