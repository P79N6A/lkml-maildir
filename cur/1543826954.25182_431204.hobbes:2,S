You are both saying the same thing so far.

That's not what Richard is saying.
He replied to your assertion where you said: "if the kernel doesn't have 
that driver configured, that's another reason not to bother registering 
its device" to which he disagreed, and I disagree too.

No one disagreed with that AFAICS.

But you originally talked about _driver_ configuration dictating if a 
_device_ should be registered or not.
The _device_ should indeed be registered based on _hardware_ config, not 
_driver_ config.
