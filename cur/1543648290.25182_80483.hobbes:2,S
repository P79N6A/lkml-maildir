Linux, please domn't apply these ACL patches until the inode method mess is
sorted out.
Ted, please either go _always_ through the {get,set}_posix_acl methods
or never.  Currently XFS doesn't know and doesn't want to know
about the so called "egenric ACL representation" used by ext2/ext3.  With
theses methods we'd have to add it to XFS which is fine for me as long as
it the representation generally used for working with ACLs.  That would mean
we'd have to add new syscall or at least VFS-level hooks to the xattr code.
Or just declare the xattr representation the default one, remove
the get_posix_acl/set_posix_acl code from this code and fix up the nfsd
patch (that doesn't seem to be submitted yet) up to us the xattr
representation.
