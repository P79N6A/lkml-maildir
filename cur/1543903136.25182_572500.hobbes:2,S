Didn't we talk about the wording and the logic some time ago?  Your
option looks like a magic switch that suddenly improves kernel
stability, hence everyone will switch it on.
How about this:
config BUILD_FOR_RELEASE
	bool "Build for release"
	help
	  If the kernel is configured as a release build, various checks
	  that are only of interest to kernel development will be
	  omitted.
	  If unsure, say Y.
Or this:
config BUILD_FOR_TESTING
	bool "Build for testing"
	help
	  If the kernel is configured as a test build, various checks
	  useful for testing of pre-releases will be activated.
	  If unsure, say N.
