Well a while back, I hacked in the pci id for my Xpress 200M (5955),
which is basically an RV370 with no dedicated vram.  I did the same
thing and claimed an RV350, which is the closest model.  This allowed
the radeon module to load.  When I startx'ed and DRI was allowed to
load on it, it locked up.  So I never sent in the patch.  I believe
the person who sent this one in originally seemed to indicate that it
worked, and I believed it if he had an X300 and my problem was having
the IGP version.  But now having this reported, I'm pretty sure it is
the same problem.  RV370 doesn't seem to work as an RV350.
