Please apply the attached patch.
We've created a new e-mail address which is currently an open 
mailing-list anybody can subscribe to.
It's currently watched by the main developers. If spam takes over the 
list, we might change it to "moderated" or even route it to one single 
person.
Sorry for the inconvenience, I hope this is a solution we can all live with.
CU
Michael.
