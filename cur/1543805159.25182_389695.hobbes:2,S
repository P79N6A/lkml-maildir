I'm still unsure about this.  It builds now, which is an improvement, but
doesn't seem to work for me.
Displaying it remotely just doesn't work for me.  I get "uml-x11-fb:
can't open X11 window" in the kernel log.
Locally, it creates a window, and boots, but there's no output in the
window, and there's no sign of a getty on the main console when I log
in through another console.
