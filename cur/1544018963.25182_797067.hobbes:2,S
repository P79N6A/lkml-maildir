Well, other than the *conceptual* ugliness of this (which
we seem to be stuck with, courtesy the board designer) ...
I have two patch format issues:
 - Always put a line of whitespace after variable
   declarations.
 - Include text like the above as part of the patch,
   even if you're stuck with a mailer that mangles
   non-attached text.
You're using Evolution, which is mentioned in the
Documentation/email-clients.txt file as having a
way (albeit awkward) to send normal patch email.
Given those changes:
