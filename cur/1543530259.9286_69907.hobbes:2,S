No. Not a "user-buffer". It may be possible to memory-map something that's
DMA..able to user space, but even that's not guaranteed. To have something
DMA..able in the ix86 machines, it needs to be:
(1)	Physical, below 16 Megabytes
(2)	DATA alignment must be such that a 64k block is not crossed
	during a DMA transfer. The ix86 machines use a page register
	to access 64k pages.
(3)	You need access to the DMA controller which the kernel isn't
	going to give you, without a fight iopl(3), etc., from user-
	space.
If you need DMA, make a module to access the device. This leads to
the question of; "Why do you need DMA?"

DMA has nothing at all to do with this. DMA transfers data between
physical areas, memory-to-ports, ports-to-memory, or (one channel)
memory-to-memory. They are not "connected-to" some common buffer.
If you have N devices that are memory-mapped to the same physical
address, they will interfere. If you have N devices that can copy
their data from a port to a shared buffer then, in principle, you
can use these devices together if you can synchronize the copying
operation. You can copy to/from ports without ever using DMA.
This means that you can copy directly to/from any user buffer
you want. You don't need to even know its physical address.
