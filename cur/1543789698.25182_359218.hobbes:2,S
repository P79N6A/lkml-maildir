The whole post fit on one screen and he was not continuing the 
conversation, he was commenting on your post as a whole. I think you're 
being a bit pedantic here.
I don't think his reply failed your criteria, it wasn't overlong, it 
didn't break a flowing discussion, and no backward reading was required.

Q:  Why is top-posting evil?
A1: Because top-posters tend to leave the entirety of the email to which
     they are replying intact, so the email gets too long.
A2: Because we prefer to use bottom-posting, and it is *extremely* hard to
     maintain a coherently flowing email conversation when some of the
     participants are bottom-posting and some are top-posting.
A3: backwards read don't humans because
