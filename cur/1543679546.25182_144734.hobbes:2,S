Agreed. Change the name too, since you're changing the calling convention.

Actually, why not just make the irq thing more explicit, and use the "__" 
naming convention for the "internal use" version), ie more along the lines 
of
	raise_softirq(int nr): completely general
	raise_softirq_irqoff(int nr): interrupts off
	__raise_softirq_irqoff(int nr): interrupts off, don't wake
instead..
