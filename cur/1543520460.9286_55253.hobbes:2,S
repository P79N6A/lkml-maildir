Hello, all...
A couple of days ago, I posted a question about some NFS client problems I'm
experiencing, and just noticed a logged message on the Solaris box that
is probably related:
Dec 26 15:14:04 aragorn unix: NOTICE: nfs_server: bad sendreply
Apparently, a lot of these are being logged.  Like I said, I'm not an
NFS internals expert, but hopefully somebody out there can help shed some
light on this.
Thanks again
-Nick
