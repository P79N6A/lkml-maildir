Which of course doesn't answer my question, but I guess it is only natural 
that you want to keep your options open.
Let me just point out that you have given out much more information about 
bitkeeper in your mails in lkml than any info one would hope to get by
using bitkeeper (except maybe by dissasembling it). I was familiar with all 
the bitkeeper concepts many months before I downloaded it (it's all on the 
website) and you have been arguing (successfully) for many of the design 
decisions you guys made (weave vs diff, distributed vs centralized etc).
So if I (or anybody else) were to start work on a competing project, I 
wouldn't even /feel/ I'm abusing your contribution to the community and 
since I've stopped using bitkeeper I'm quite certain I wouldn't be 
violating your licence.
Thanks for taking the time to aswer though.
