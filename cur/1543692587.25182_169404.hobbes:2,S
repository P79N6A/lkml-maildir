I think it's totally unreasonable to expect the glibc folks
to suck in every single new weird API that ends up in the kernel.
Part of this is our job.
But until we have that bit solved, it's irresonsible of us to tell
users to go scream at the glibc people.  Rather, we should fix the
(really, honestly, incredibly minor) things that prevent these kernel
header files from working for users.
