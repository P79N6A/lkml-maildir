Ingo,
Your arguments are personal, not technical.   Which billiob dollar
company did you support with 70 million customers exactly?  Not having
this out in the field makes folks jobs 100 times harder and more costly
for companies to support.  When and if you ever run your own business,
you'll understand these things.
