Nope, the /proc/123/threads/246/stat approach is required.
Without this, procps is forced to read _all_ tasks to
group threads together. This is slow, prone to race conditions,
more vulnerable to kernel bugs, and a memory hog.
FYI, thread grouping is required even if whole-process
information is available. Many "ps" output formats need
grouping, and it is desirable for many more.
I might as well mention that whole-process information
includes the four fault counters and some indication
that wchan data is multi-valued (a '*' must be displayed
in that case). There may be more I haven't spotted yet.
Note that the recent /proc/*/wchan addition was botched.
Caching is prevented due to race conditions. This could
be fixed by changing the file format to contain:
    number, function name
with optional:
    function address, file name, module name
(next time, discuss such changes with an experienced
procps developer first)
