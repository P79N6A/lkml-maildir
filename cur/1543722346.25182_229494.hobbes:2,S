This looks good, a definite improvement over what's currently in the
kernel.  I do have one question about the whole msi.c file (and this
applies to the code that's already in the tree, too).  Why is config
space being accessed via calls like
	dev->bus->ops->read(dev->bus, dev->devfn, ... )
instead of just calling
        pci_read_config_word(dev, ... )
The only difference seems to be that MSI is bypassing the locking in
access.c.  Is there some reason for this?
Thanks,
  Roland
