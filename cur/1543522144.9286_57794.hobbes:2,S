The driver uses a timer to recover from hung transceivers. The timer noticed
that the card has new packets pending, but that the interrupt is not (yet)
called. How many of these messages do you receive, and how many interrupt
arrive? (cat /proc/interrupts). It's possible that they are caused by the
latency between "hardware triggers the interrupt" and "driver has
acknowledged the interrupt"

rtl8129() is running on both cpus: [i guess because]
* one cpu because the hardware interrupt arrived
* one cpu because the timer called the function.
I guess that "dev->interrupt" enforces the synchronization, but I don't
understand why "dev->interrupt" is reset to 0:
