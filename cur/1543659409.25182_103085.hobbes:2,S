I can see that you would have to carry that information forward to the
"inode" if you used the data area address, for stat that's probaby not an
issue, for open after you open the file you don't really need access
checking and the times on a CD don't change.
What's the case where you are starting with an inode and trying to get to
a filename without having gone through a dir entry to the inode? No one is
running things like dump/restore on iso9660 I hope!
