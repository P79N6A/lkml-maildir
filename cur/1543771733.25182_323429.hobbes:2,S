On all the UARTs I've seen, it works with FCR=0.  Hence my suspicion
of your device.
The problem is that most architectures supply SERIAL_PORT_DFNS,
which are compiled-in mappings of /dev/ttyS device names to
specific devices, so 8250.c knows about and uses those devices
before they're properly identified and initialized.
If you can remove your SERIAL_PORT_DFNS (and discover the devices
at boot-time via a mechanism like ACPI or PCI enumeration), then
8250.c won't start using the port until it's correctly initialized.
That means the serial console won't start working until later, of
course.  If you need a serial console early, I think you should use
something like 8250_early.c.  That uses "console=uart,io,0x3f8", so
you don't have to have compiled-in knowledge of the device names.
It currently initializes the UART with FCR=0 also, but it would
be reasonable to add a "no-init" option to just use the device in
the state firmware left it in.
