I took a look at fs/buffer.c in 2.0.36 and compared it with 2.2.1.
What I found was
1. We do a lock_kernel() on each sys_fsync().
   So all other processes using this lock_have to wait... Why?
2. Plus we ensure we get the semaphore
	/* We need to protect against concurrent writers.. */
	down(&inode->i_sem);
So I have problems to get it. Since we called lock_kernel() we are the ony
on in this pice of code. 
So AFAIK wheter the kernel lock is unneccessary or the semaphore or both?
Could someone give me comments on this?
