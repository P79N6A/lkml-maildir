Ahh. And maybe this only happens for the "switch()" statement, which would 
explain why gcc-2.95 doesn't have problem with a lot of other 64-bit uses 
in the kernel.
A simple fix might be to just cast it down to a long, since the high bits
seem to be unused. I assume that would fix it. Alternatively, what about
making the "switch()" just be a series of if-statements?
