No go. I still get that device not responding (error=-84).
If I understand your patch, disabling hotplug and loading
usb-storage manually shoud work. It isn't. Actually
I believe that it never got to call hotplug.
usbview does not see the device.
I forgot to say. On one of those computers where I do the testing
I have a USB mouse - which is working just fine.
