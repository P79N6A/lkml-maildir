Ah yes, I see. We both wrote a man page, and each contained
stuff not in the other, and I asked you to merge them, but
then nothing happened anymore. Maybe I should merge them
myself.
[In case you do the merging: please distinguish clearly
between what is prescribed by POSIX (or SUSv2, or Austin draft 7)
and what is implemented by (g)libc or the Linux kernel.
I see that your version has prototypes like
	caddr_t mmap(caddr_t  addr, ...
but this caddr_t is typically from BSD, and is void * these days.]
