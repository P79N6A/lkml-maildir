You know all the stuff that's marked __user?  It's all kernel ABI.  Having it 
defined in two places invites version skew, and the kernel needs it too 
because the kernel is parsing the stuff sent in by userspace and filling it 
out to send back to userspace.
Lots of syscalls and ioctls and such pass a structure back and forth from 
userspace to the kernel and back, right?  Doing a stat() fills out a 
structure, doing an losetup fills out a structure, and so on.
Userspace needs to know what's in this structure.  It may be wrapped in a libc 
function that fills out a different structure from the kernel structure, but 
the data that goes back and forth between the program and the kernel has to 
be defined in a header somewhere so the libc knows what the kernel's sending 
and the kernel knows what the libc is sending.  (And for those functions with 
no libc wrapper, the user program needs to know the structure directly, 
somehow.)
Having a data-marshalling ABI structure defined in two places invites version 
skew.  Userspace needs access to this (at least to build a libc), and the 
kernel needs access to this, because it's a _communication_mechanism_.  You 
can't have a communication mechanism that's only defined at one end.

The #define is, indeed, smelly.
