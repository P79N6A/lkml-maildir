Newbie me, I was slow to imagine that depmod -V could be helpfully
reporting two independent series of version numbers, the older prefaced
with "depmod version ", the newer prefaced with "module-init-tools ".
I wrongly thought that 2.4.22 was 0.9.9 or better, even when I saw the
modprobe complaint:
QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
Therefore I propose the following patch.

+Also upgrade your module-init-tools if your depmod -V gives you a
+"depmod version" rather than a "module-init-tools" version.
