You are not the first to ask for this - suprise.
Alexey point out a good solution but I have added to my tod list
to do something a bit more intelligent when ARCH changes.
The patches I have seen so far has been lacking fundamental functionality
and on top of this I hope to find a nice way to preserve CROSSCOMPILE
since that often change too.
