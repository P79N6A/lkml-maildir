Image processing people use tiling. Try loading a giant image into
the gimp and into a non smart application like xpaint. The difference is
huge just by careful implementation of the algorithms

Yes but you don't do it that way, you do stripes of parallel fft
computations. We can all write dumb programs that don't behave well with the
VM layer.
