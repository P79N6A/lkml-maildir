Replying to Daniel Phillips:

0.

#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	int i, j, k = atoi(argv[1]);
	char t[128];
	for (i = 0; i < k; i++) {

		if (-1 == (j = creat(t, S_IRWXU))) {
			perror("Create file");
			printf("no: %d\n", i);
			return;
		}
		close(j);
	}

this will be the next series of tests :)

Yes, increasing journal to fit the whole directory in it (as Andreas
Dilger said) improved results by 1/4. But. Initially my test was
1000000 files. /dev/sda4 in my tests 1882844. And I am quickly hitting
inode limit on -t news ext3 filesystem so I need to artificially
increase it at mke2fs time, but I decided to not do so (yet).

I just trying to write a caching proxy-like application and not
reinvent the wheel (aka design my own filesystem and store it in a big
file just because some filesystem is so slow on large
directories/cannot make more than N empty objects etc).
