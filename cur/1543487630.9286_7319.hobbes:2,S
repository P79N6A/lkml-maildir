I have two questions regarding memory managment:
1. I would like to map a buffer from user address space to kernel address
   space, so that a user application can write data to this buffer
   and the kernel than can read this data WITHOUT having to copy
   it from user to kernel space (and vice versa)
2. I would like to lock these buffers (pages) in memory, so that they
   can't get swapped.
I would be glad if anybody could provide infos or pointers to such,
how solve these problems.
Thanks a lot,
  Olaf
