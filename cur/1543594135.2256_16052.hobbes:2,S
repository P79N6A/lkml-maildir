Well, at least I know that this is expected with the VM, although I do still
think this is bad behavior.  If my disk is idle why would I wait until I have
greater than 100MB of data to write before I finally start actually moving some
data to disk?

And this is definately a noticeable fix, thanks for your continued work.  I know
it's hard to get everything balanced out right, and I only wrote this email to
describe some behavior I was seeing and make sure it was expected in the current
VM.  You've let me know that it is, and it's really minor compared to problems
some of the earlier kernels had.
Later,
Tom
