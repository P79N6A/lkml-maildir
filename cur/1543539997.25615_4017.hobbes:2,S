Just compiled test5-pre6...it seems okay, except that some
modules dont seem to be decrementing the usage count on
unload.  Witness:
pppdroot@darkstar:~# lsmod    
Module                  Size  Used by
ppp_async               6316   1  (autoclean)
esp                    19184   1  (autoclean)
ppp_generic            12928   7  (autoclean) [ppp_async]
slhc                    4608   1  (autoclean) [ppp_generic]
soundcore               3812   6  (autoclean)
...soundcore and ppp_generic being the ones getting stuck
here.   These are the only two i've found (and I've modprobed/
rmmod'ed most of 'em).    The drivers still work okay.
test5-pre4 was my previous kernel, and this didnt happen
with that one.
