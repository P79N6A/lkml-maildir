it doesn't enough ;(
you still do a major suggestion to keep the code in a repo outside the
kernel. For a single driver really that's at best "optional" and
shouldn't be the prime recommendation. 
"If your driver is affected, you are expected to pick up these changes
and merge them with your primary code (e.g. if you have a CVS repo for
maintaining your code)."
that sentence is just really the one that I hate. It's bogus. It still
calls the private CVS copy "primary".
If you do the right thing (and store deltas against mainline and not
full code except for scratch stuff) then this is no question of "merging
back from mainline" at all.
