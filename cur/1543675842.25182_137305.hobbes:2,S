I'd say that i386 is the only one needing direct auditing, the others
can differ if they discover it's problematic. But I think your stress
testing should be enough; if there's a problem it should come up rather
quickly, as context switching is very fundamental and the only thing
that could violate the assumptions given to the compiler, and when
broken it's very obvious _something_ is broken.
As I had heard it, this broke rather blatantly. If it's passing tests
then the issues I had heard of are not happening.
