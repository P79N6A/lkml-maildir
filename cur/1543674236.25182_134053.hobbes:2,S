You just found a rather subtle bug which was fixed around 2 or 3 years
ago. :-)

get_undo_access is a declaration of intention to modify the buffer. 
When that happens, it calls do_get_write_access() with the force_copy
flag set.  That means that it _always_ creates a new frozen_data copy of
the buffer the first time we get undo access to a bitmap buffer within
any given transaction.  That basically means that for bitmaps,
frozen_data always holds the version of the buffer as of the end of the
previously completed transaction.

Ah, but the *immediately* following lines are:
			if (jh->b_frozen_data) {
				jh->b_committed_data = jh->b_frozen_data;
				jh->b_frozen_data = NULL;
			}
so the frozen data that was preserved at get_undo_access() time has now
committed to disk and gets rotated into the b_committed_data version. 
This is exactly how we get the new version of the committed data when
the old transaction commits.
Cheers,
 Stephen
