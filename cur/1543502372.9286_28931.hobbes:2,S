Well, it may not *exactly* be the API, but it is certainly how redraw events
are handled.
Defering and delaying event redraws during a window move or resize is super
useful in making the BeOS *much* more snappy/responsive than X/GNOME/KDE.
I was hoping that my modifications to Enlightenment would help with releasing
X locks, but it's looking like I'll have to actually dig into the X libraries
themselves. We'll see...

Yeah, I agree. the GTK folks are doing something like that, but I'm not
sure how variuos X internals are going to deal with its' event queue on top
of another event queue architecture.
We'll see...
Thanks.
