Hi,
I wrote this script a while back.  It creates 20 files, 0 through 19,
and then shuffles them around, deletes and recreates them as fast as 
possible.
It's a good way to test for race conditions.  I always run with 
preempt turned on so that makes my system more sensitive to race 
conditions.  Neither JFS or Reiserfs survived a whole night of testing 
on my system.  It's a pretty grueling test...
