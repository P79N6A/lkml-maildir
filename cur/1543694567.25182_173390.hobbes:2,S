| -------------------------------
| 
| With -test8, the only difference is that the update_process_times line
| is missing from the middle, and
| mark_offset_tsc+0x38d/0x550
| is visible at the top instead.
| 
| Could this be the sign of malfunctioning hardware?

Can you supply any more of the oops message?  It's missing a good bit
before the call trace that you listed.
Maybe check the kernel message file for the rest of it?
Thanks,
