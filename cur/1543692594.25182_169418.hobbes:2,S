You continue to verify that you don't understand how kernel <-> user level
interfaces are used by user level programs. 
The Linux kernel constantly adds new interfaces or changes old ones.
A user program that is going to use these interfaces _needs_ to include
up-to-date kernel include interface definitions.
If the kernel is not integral part of the whole system (which is definitely true
for a Linux based system) user level programs _need_ to include the kernel 
include files from the same snapshot as the kernel.
The basic concept of hiding kernel (only) data structures from user level 
programs is to put them between #ifdef __KERNEL__ #endif.
It is definitely typically not done by editing kernel level files later and by 
creating a different set (and thus potentially out of sync) of include files.
If you don't understand this bacic concept, then it makes not sense to continue
this discussion :-(

Did you ever do a 'du' on /usr/include/sys and compare with 'du' on
/usr/src/linux? It seems that not :-(
A kernel source that uses internal include files that deviate (how ever) 
from the ones that are present in /usr/include/sys/ needs to include include
files that are consistent for user level use. The _way_ how you do this does 
not matter!
If you decide to have a different set of hand edited files, create them
but _always_ include them with the Linux kernel sources....
However, it is easily to understand that it makes more sense to just keep
the internal include files from the Linux kernel constsistent.
The current include files inside the Linux kernel definitely are not
consistent.

Well, this has been discussed several times and it would make sense if you
try to e.g. search the Linux kernel mailing lists or the cdrecording mailing 
lists.....
Search for failing cdrecord compilations and runs that are caused from Linux
kernel changes ....
I don't like that an important discussion about Linux include files to be
converted into rants....so let us stay with the topic.
I also told you that the addition of a single feature to an interface
does not make sense as long as user level programs cannot use them. If you like
to use them you need up to date include files for the kernel interfaces.
...please don't try to tell me that Linux never adds new features that
result at least in extended interfaces...
