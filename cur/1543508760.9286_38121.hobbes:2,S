Thanks for the reply... I used to have this contoller/cabling setup
working on a UP system (none of the cabling came with the controller...
it's Belkin stuff I think... or Cables To Go):
SuperMicro P6BSA
Celeron 266 @ 400MHz
IBM UDMA33 7200rpm HD
Toshiba SCSI 32x CD
Microtek E3 SCSI Scanner
3Com 3c905B PCI Ethernet
Genuine DEC 21140 PCI Ethernet
Currently I have:
Tyan 1696DLUA w/ on-board Adaptec 7895 (IDE and USB disabled)
Dual Celeron 366's
Seagate 4gig SCSI Wide (on Adaptec)
IBM UltraStar 9ES 4gig SCSI UW (on Adaptec)
AIWA NS8 SCSI Tape Drive (on Adaptec)
Yamaha 2260 CDRW (on BT-958)
Toshiba 32x CD (on BT-958)
Microtek E3 SCSI Scanner (on BT-958 external)
Genuine DEC 21140 PCI Ethernet
Tonight I'm going to swap hardware and reinstall RedHat 6.0... ABIT BP6
Dual Celeron Motherboard, AMI MegaRAID 428 SCSI controller, Intel EEPro
10/100 Management PCI ethernet. I figure I'll try this with the BusLogic
and SCSI scanner... if it works stable I'll let you know. If you have
any ideas on things to check let me know... otherwise I'll setup my
Microtek E3 Plus Parallel Port scanner which is about half the speed but
is solid as a rock (it's support by ppSCSI).
I'm not the only one who has had this problem... there isn't a person on
the SANE list with a stable SMP machine and a BusLogic controller. So
the problem is at least with several common scanners.
