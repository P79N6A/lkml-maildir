This suggestion only applies if the customer's box is the RedHat one,
and you are using MS's telnet.
When I have a telnet session going from Win95 to RedHat 5.2, and I run
the 'top' command,  I only get the first 5 lines, and the header line
for the processes. No processes actually show up. If I use netterm
(trial download available at www.netterm.com) to telnet, I can see
processes within top. Maybe this is a similar thing?
