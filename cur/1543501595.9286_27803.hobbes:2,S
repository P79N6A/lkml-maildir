No. There are just specific version of init scripts :-)

It IS true under glibc2. glibc2 just do not use /usr/include/linux at all ...

But it will work IMO :-)) If user can compile special version of kernel not
shipped on CD he probably can compile your sources as well and if not he is
running version shipped on CD...

Yes, it's exactly "Linux way" to deal with such problems... But it does not
solve problem as well: how to update driver without updating of the whole
kernel ? I'm just can not see any proper way to solve this problem :-/
