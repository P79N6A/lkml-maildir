Subject: Re: Silent freezes with kernels through 2.2.9.  No Oops. - Same here

Hi Mark,
We also experience silent freezes problems here on SMP. 2.2.7 has no
problems (or at least much less), and 2.2.8 and 2.2.9 crash regularly
(often after a few minutes) while running bonnie filesystem tests (bonnie
-s 2000) and/or while doing parallel kernel compiles. For now, we've
rolled back to 2.2.7.
Our freezes don't show the eth0 message though. Our configuration is a
dual system (2x450Mhz) with 4 UDMA disks on Promise/33 controllers in
software raid0, 128MB DIMM, dec21143 (tulip) 10/100MB nic, i740 8MB/AGP
video. Software configuration is a pristine RedHat 6.0 'install
everything'.
The freezes are complete; no more num/capslock, no more magic sysrq, no
more ping responses, no more screen updates. We've tried running without
update/bdflush, which changed the frequency of the crashes, but the
freezes still remain.
Maybe, did you try Dimitris' patch of May 14? It fixes 2 races in the
scheduler, so it could be the one (I'll try as soon as I have access to
the machine again).
Cya, 
Jelle.
