Has a "good " version of 2.4.18 ( with the fix below added ) been put on
the kernel.org site? if not when can we expect it?
from kernel.org changelog :
Update: The SET_PERSONALITY fix in rc4 has _not_
been included in the final 2.4.18 by mistake.
Thanks guys
Madhav
PS : Is this the last of the 2.4 series?
