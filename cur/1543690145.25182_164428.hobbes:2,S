One of OSDL's reasons for existance is to arrange for Linux developers
to have access to larger hardware configurations.  I'm sure you could
get a project machine here at OSDL to do testing of I/O scheduler
modifications, or other testing on a larger machine.  Several other
kernel developers have project machines here at OSDL.
Look at the web page
	
http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/be_an_associate.html
Fill out the web page form to get a login.  send email to Cliffw@osdl.org
and me, and we'll see that it gets handled quickly.
You'd be able to ssh into a front-end machine here at OSDL. It would
give you serial console access to a test machine.  You'd also be able
to power on/power off and reset the test machine, and ssh into the
test machine from that front-end.
