Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: Make NR_IRQS configurable in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently on a SMP system we can theoretically support
NR_CPUS*224 irqs.  Unfortunately our data structures
don't cope will with that many irqs, nor does hardware
typically provide that many irq sources.
With the number of cores starting to follow Moore's Law,
and the apicid limits being raised beyond an 8bit
number trying to track our current maximum with our
current data structures would be fatal and wasteful.
So this patch decouples the number of irqs we support
from the number of cpus.  We can revisit this decision
once someone reworks the current data structures.
This version has my stupid typos fix and the true maximum
exposed to make it clear that I have a low default.  The
worst that I can see happening is there won't be any
per_cpu space left for modules if someone sets this
too high, but the system should still boot.
For non-SMP systems the default is set to 224 IRQs.
