So if someone you trusted actually started batching up small fixes and 
sending you things like
"37 random documentation updates - no code changed", "11 patches to fix
kmalloc checks", "maintainers updates to 6 network drivers"
that would work sanely ? I think that would actually fix a lot of the stuff 
getting lost right now. Its mostly small stuff, often from new people, or from
folks who met a bug, fixed it and have a totally seperate and rather more 
important (to them) project and deadline to meet that is going walkies.
It also increases bandwidth for sorting out the big stuff.
The other related question is device driver implementation stuff (not interfaces
and abstractions). You don't seem to check that much anyway, or have any taste
in device drivers 8) so should that be part of the small fixing job ?
