I'm working on this with the new libata drivers. The list of what is
broken in the old driver for 372N/302N is rather large as they are
actually very different to the other chips.
I've got the correct timing tables and PLL tune information for the 302N
now which appears to be very similar if not identical for these needs so
if someone wants to hack the old drivers/ide/pci driver a bit I can
provide reasonably accurate chip id and chip pll base information to
enable a fix.
PS: Anyone got a 371N (specifically 371N) can send me the pci id and
rev.
