Hi Greg, Wendy, all,
Our serial port monitoring tools need to know these things, and to
find them out *without* opening up the serial port to do an ioctl().
For example, lets say a customer has a modem connected to a serial port.
If you were to open up the port with an "stty -a" to get the current 
settings and signals, you would unintentionally raise RTS and DTR.
Now the modem sees DTR raised, and might react to it by mistake.
Usually raising and dropping RTS/DTR quickly on a modem won't hurt
anything,
but its not particularly a "good" when the modem is not expecting it.
This is why we export the various signals/stats/signals to sysfs (used
to be proc),
so our management tools can get the information about the serial port
without being
intrusive by opening up the port.
