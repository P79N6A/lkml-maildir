    Not at all. I can boot using isolinux (or syslinux), for example.
The failure happens in all machines I've tested, but depending on the
machine, the particular fail is one or another: some of them
generate 'invalid compressed format', others just hang, etc...
    But booting the same kernel using isolinux works :( That is, it
is not a mkisofs issue, nor a cdrecord issue, etc...
    Thanks for your answer, Denis :)
