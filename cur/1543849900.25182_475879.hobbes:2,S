May be. I just kept it because already data segment had 'E' permissions.
Ian, any reason why did you keep 'E' on data segment? If it is not
intentional, I will get rid of it.
>(Btw., why does 'note' need 'R'?)
I went through the comments Ian had put in his patch. There also he 
mentions that people objected to 'R' permissions for note segment as
it is read only by boot loader. He kept it because i386 had the similar
thing. 
Ian, again if there is no specific reason to keep 'R' for note, I will
get rid of it.

I think plain "init" also does not reflect the correct name as this section
is also mapping .data.init_task, .data.page_aligned and .data_nosave, which
will probably never get freed. It maps smp alternatives sections which will
not be freed if CPU_HOTPLUG is enabled. It also maps .bss, which will never
get freed.
I think, the sections which are not being freed, should be moved up and
made part of 'data' segment. Then create a segment 'init' for all the init
text/data and finally create another segment say 'bss' to map bss at the
end. How does this sound?
Thanks
Vivek
