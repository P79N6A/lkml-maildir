I'd actually claim the current mechanism is the sickest.  It relies on
magic hard-coded paths (/dev/console, also /sbin/init, though you can
override that), and we end up in a terrible state halfway between user-
and kernelspace until we execute /sbin/init.
I think it might actually be worth it to think about an approach where
the boot loader sets up part of init (which mounts the root fs, opens
/dev/console, and execs /sbin/init, in the normal case), and we can move
more stuff out of the kernel proper.  No more special initrd handling,
fewer hard-coded paths, less non-pageable memory.
