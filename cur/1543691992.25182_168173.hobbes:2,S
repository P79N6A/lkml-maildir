That means that hotplug/automount will have to re-parse the partition
table itself to mount only the real partitions. So the job is done
twice, in-kernel and in userspace.
Have no doubts that *real* users (like the police force mentionned by
Andries) will let their system automount their USB disks, they'll never
figure out which devices look bogus (dev/sd what ?!?) and which one to
mount.
If the partition discovery and validity check is done in userspace, why
still do it in-kernel ?
