yep, this is a frequent problem at the level of the kernel. We fixed such
a (longtime) performance bug just a couple of weeks ago in the TCP-accept
logic. We are using FIFO in most places where multiple contexts are
waiting. But is 'shared everything multithreading' the natural solution
for this? Nope, that statement is misleading. 'Multi-contexting' is the
solution. Those contexts can be 'shared-everything threads' or 'isolated
processes' as well.
