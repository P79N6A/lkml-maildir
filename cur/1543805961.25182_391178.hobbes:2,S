I don't know if there is a problem, but it goes against the concept of 
"one-off" fixes that aren't maintained (aka the purpose of the -stable 
team). This slope eventually leads us to backporting -stable fixes from 
other -stable releases etc etc. 
If there's one thing I've learned from watching guys like Alan Cox 
maintain stable releases, it's that they're profoundly good at saying 
"no". I'm not saying that's warranted here, I'm just trying to encourage 
the dialog (I suspect that I've missed part of the conversation as I am 
not currently subscribed to LKML).
