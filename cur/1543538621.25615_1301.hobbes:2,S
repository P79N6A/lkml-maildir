Unfortunately it is an issue already today.
Several people complained to me about problems with a larger
than 1 TB RAID, where signedness problems start occurring.
And if 1 TB is used today then 2 TB is very close nearby.
Probably start will have to become a long long, and we need
an audit of the kernel source to see where things will fail.
If it turns out that the change is too complicated we can
get temporary relief by using a larger unit, like 4K blocks
instead of 512-byte sectors.
