	Somehow, working for 2/3, or even 75% of cases is less than encouraging 
to me.
	Especially if I must not only set up boxes that I may not touch 
physically for days, weeks, etc. Or I suggest which kernel for other 
people to use, due to security fixes (which, iirc, not all 2.4 fixes have 
been forward ported yet), features, etc.
	2.6 is... getting there. and I DO much appreciate the work of the 
developers. But with devfs deprecated, udev still coming into its own 
(Nice work GregKG btw); with the myriad of (user visible) input layer 
changes; the change in focus on initrds (it used to be a nice thing that 
only serious people use. Now, although still optional, it is now becoming 
much more important). Or mebbe consider that the last time I tried to 
install the new modutils (I'm blaming my distro vendor for this), it 
broke my 2.4 modutils, requiring me to boot with init=/bin/sh and fix it 
up.
Sure. little things, but altogether, they add up to a lot more work to 
learn.
