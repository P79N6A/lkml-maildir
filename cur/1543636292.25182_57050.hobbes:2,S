Will look into this soon.

And probably into this, if it turns out that we're wasting
too much memory in no longer used pte_chains in real workloads,
which will probably happen ;)

Rmap for 2.4 also has some code which could be used for this.

Benchmarky loads without a working set probably aren't all that
suitable for evaluating page replacement. VM (and general caching)
works _because_ of the working set property.
Does anybody know of a working set simulator we could use to test
things like this ?

That's the "minimal" part of "minimal rmap" ;))
Ed Tomlinson has some code for 11), which should be mergeable
soon.  In combination with changed page replacement priorities
we'll be able to make sure updatedb won't evict everything.
The importance of rmap here is making sure we're _able_ to do
this kind of tuning instead of tweaking the same magic knobs
we've (unsuccessfully) tweaked in the last 8 years.

Rik
