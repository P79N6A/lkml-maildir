As a general rule I agree with that.  However, the openib svn tree
we're talking about is not some project that is off in space never
merging with the kernel; as Christoph said, it's really just a staging
area for stuff that isn't ready for upstream yet.n
Perhaps it would be more politically correct to use git to develop
kernel code, but in the end that's really just a technical difference
that shouldn't matter.

OK, that's great.  But now I don't understand your original point.
You say there are people putting pressure on distros to ship what's in
openib svn rather than the upstream kernel, but if the distros are
going to ignore them, what does it matter?
And this thread started with me trying to help the IBM people make
progress towards merging a big chunk of that svn tree upstream.  That
should make you happy, right?
