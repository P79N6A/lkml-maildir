Those device ids are already in my tree, as it was my understanding that
you would not be sending me patches for them :)
I'll split this patch up into something that updates the device ids and
then does all of the other changes.  The device ids can go into 2.6.24
(and -stable if I miss the merge window), but the other changes should
wait until 2.6.25.
Any objection to this?
