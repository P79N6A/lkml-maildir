Hello!
I recently upgraded my kernel to 2.6.21 (.1 and .2 with identical
results) and my second IDE controller, a HPT366 on a PCI card,
doesn't get enabled any more. The latest previous kernel I used was
2.6.19.7, where the HPT366 worked.
Here's the HPT366 part of the 2.6.21.2 dmesg:
HPT366: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:02:0a.0
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:0a.0[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
HPT366: chipset revision 1
HPT366: using 33 MHz PCI clock
HPT366: 100% native mode on irq 18
HPT366: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:0a.1[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
HPT366: using 33 MHz PCI clock
HPT366: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
There is a flash disk connected to the primary channel (master)
which also shows up in the controller's BIOS screen, so I don't
think it's true that both ports are disabled.
Under 2.6.17.9 the "neither IDE port enabled" message doesn't
happen and hde gets detected.
Please CC me on replies.
