Any reclaim must involve the driver.  That doesn't mean that it must involve
the application.  That said this isn't trivial to implement.

InfiniBand provides support for deregistering memory that might be
referenced at some future time by an RDMA operation.  The only side effect
this has is that the QP on both sides of the connection transition to an
error state.
Upon abnormal termination, all registrations must be undone and the memory
unpinned.  This must be synchronized with the hardware so that there are no
races.  The IB deregistration semantics provide such synchronization.  I'd
venture that any HW design that does not do this is broken.
Requiring the memory to never be freed upon abnormal termination equates to
a serious memory leak, in that physical memory is leaked, not virtual.
