If we run it down to that, can I bounce it back at AMD as defective?  
Or can it be coded around?  If its bugging my Athlon 2800XP, then I'd 
have to assume (dmesg says its stepping 00 FWIW) that I'm far from 
alone.  AMD is peddling these just like Orville R. sells popcorn.  
And, from previous experience with this particular vendor, if I give 
convincing proof the chip really is from a defective run, I'd suspect 
a replacement would be in a fedex bag & headed my way before the day 
is out.  But I'd need proof of the problem.
