That makes a lot of sense to me :> 
It also happens with suspend to disk now that Pavel and I have added
sysdev support to our implementations.
I was doing some looking in this area last week, but ran out of time. I
was seeing the clock being out - sometimes - by 1 hour+.
That section of code could also be improved by reusing the value of the
first call to get_cmos_time(). The way that function works, two
consecutive calls will cause a one second delay for the second call. A
__get_cmos_time function that doesn't wait for the start of a second was
suggested for where we only care about consistency and not about getting
the start of the second. I'll send a patch shortly.

I think that was Pavel's idea; something about getting process times
right. Speaking for myself, I might be being short sighted, but I just
want to save the user having to run /sbin/hwclock --hctosys afterwards.
