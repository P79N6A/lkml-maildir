Linus,
I've updated NTFS to work with the current linus-2.5 BK tree containing
Al's cleanups. I also added to Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt how to
use the MD driver to make ntfs stripe and volume sets work under Linux.
It would be great if you would do a bk pull from the ntfs tng bkbits
repository:
        bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5
If you would prefer a bitkeeper patch inline with an email, please let
me know and I will generate one and email it to you ASAP...
Best regards,
        Anton
ps. For all non-bitkeeper users, I will make normal diff -urNp patches
available once 2.5.11 is released on ftp.??.kernel.org. For now, you
can browse the code on-line:
