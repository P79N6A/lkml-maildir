Subject: [PATCH] PCI: disable MSI by default on systems with Serverworks HT1000 chips
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/7/95

I've been seeing lots of messages like these:
eth0: No interrupt was generated using MSI, switching to INTx mode.
Please report this failure to the PCI maintainer and include system
chipset information.
On several systems that use the following Severworks HT1000 (also
sometimes labeled as a Broadcom chipset as well) bridge chips.  It
doesn't appear MSI works well (if at all) on these systems.
