I am trying to use lcrash to debug a panic
I have the System.map of the original kernel (without modules loaded),
Kerntypes file and the dump file
    <4>Modules linked in: ip_conntrack_dos
    <4>CPU:    0
    <4>EIP:    0060:[<f8bb245b>]    Tainted: P      VLI
    <4>EFLAGS: 00010246   (2.6.12)
    <4>EIP is at init_conntrack_syn+0x193/0x214 [ip_conntrack_dos]
    <4>eax: dd0f34b3   ebx: f48de908   ecx: f48de900   edx: 00000000
    <4>esi: f4c65bc8   edi: f48de900   ebp: 00100100   esp: c040dae0
    <4>ds: 007b   es: 007b   ss: 0068
If i Use the original System.map, it doesnt find the symbol for the
init_conntrack_syn
( EIP is pointing there)
However, kallsyms has an entry for that
f8b752c8 t init_conntrack_syn
If kallsyms has all the symbols, I am wondering why does it have lesser lines ?
wc -l
12343 kallsyms
32127 System.map
Will it work if I cat System.map and kallsyms together and do a sort and uniq
so that i get the union of both ?
