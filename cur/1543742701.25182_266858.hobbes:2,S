Hm, I've got a (very simple) line determining utility,
http://linux01.org:2222/f/UHXT/bin/sourcefuncsize
maybe someone can pipe it together with ls -l or whatever.

At least they know one thing: that thou should not stuff everything into one
.so but multiple ones (if it's a lot). That /may/ reduce the size-in-memory,
because not all .so's need to be loaded. OTOH, most apps load /all/ anyway.
Heh, there we go.

I sense Java and C# being the best example.

FBUI does not have 3d acceleration?

I doubt even the -O2-only-people use gprof/gcov frequently. :(
