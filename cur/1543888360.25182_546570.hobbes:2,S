Yes it is a workaround for critical ACPI bugs like that or similar:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/22336
It's also convenient to e.g. lower passive trip point to avoid fan
noise.
Some people are used to it, I already wanted to write a little userspace
prog to use them as it is really easy to fake cooling_mode (trip points
are modified by BIOS) and eliminate fan noise and other things by e.g.
reducing passsive or whatever trip point.
This is at least a major sysfs interface change, has this been discussed
somewhere before or declared deprecated?
It's there for a long time, why is this "a dangerous and mis-leading
hack." now?
I'd suggest to revert this and I can come with something like "only
allow lower values
than BIOS provides" patch if the current implementation is considered
dangerous.
