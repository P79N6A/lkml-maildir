First of all, about your previous e-mail: you're correct, the members
not explicitly initialized behave like when  a _static_ object is not
explicitly initialized (ie., zero'ing it), instead of behaving like an
_automatic_ object not being explicitly initialized (which was the
kind of behavior I was expecting). This is part of the C99
specification, indeed.
See section 6.7.8, constraints no. 10 and 19, for more info.

Nicely pointed out, I hadn't thought about this possible maintenance
issue. Looks like a nice place for a memset() to reside.
