Right. We're always testing the TIF_NEED_RESCHED field after the
switch.

No, I meant the cacheline holding the field of course. I guess I
could have looked for a field further down, but even so, ->timestamp
might be 96 bytes into the structure on a 64-bit arch, which may or
may not be the first cacheline... but you get the idea.

Yeah, then a specific field _within_ next->mm or thread_info may
want to be fetched. In short, I don't see any argument why we
shouldn't call the function prefetch_task().
Secondly, I don't really like your prefetch(kernel_stack()) function
because it doesn't really give architectures enough control over
exactly what cachelines they get in memory.
prefetching and memory access patterns of all this stuff are fairly
architecture specific. I see nothing wrong with having a prefetch_task()
call. (Although I agree things like thread_info->flags and next->mm can
be done in generic code).
