Hooks for _strong_ encryption are, weak crypto (as rot13 _very_ clearly
is) is exportable (see your netscape browser). The other question is
whether the prohibition of crypto in e.g. France and Russia
covers/covered rot13. I think not. Rot13 is nothing that can be
considered _encryption_ anymore...?
