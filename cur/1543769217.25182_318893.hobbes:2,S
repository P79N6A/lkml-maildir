The public announcement, with venue and travel details will be tomorrow.  This 
is a technical workshop that will take place on June 20 and 21st in Walldorf 
Germany, near Heidelberg and south of Frankfurt.   The goal is to either 
validate, reject, modify, or combine the kernel interfaces that Red Hat has 
proposed, and that other groups may propose in the next few weeks.  We will 
only be looking at code that actually exists.
For those who cannot physically attend, we will do our utmost to provide a 
two-way audio connection, hopefully without toll charges.
This Second Annual Cluster Summit (sorry if it sounds presumptuous) is 
sponsored by Red Hat, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu-Siemens, Dell, and Oracle.  My 
apologies in advance for leaving only four weeks leadtime for the public 
announcement.
Regards,
Daniel
