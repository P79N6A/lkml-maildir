But you talk about the current implementation, don't you?
Is there something to prevent an implementation of rwlocks in the
kernel, where a wrlock will lock (postponed) further rdlock requests?
I mean: the wrlocker prevents newly rdlocks to succeed and waits for the
current rdlockers to release the lock an then gets the lock..
