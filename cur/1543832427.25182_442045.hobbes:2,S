If there's a runnable task on the system, the run queue should never empty 
except inside schedule(). The scheduler should then swap expired and active.
First question - what kernel are you running? Is it stock?
Second question - what's the application? Are you sure your threads just 
aren't falling into interruptible sleep due to an app bug of some sort? Are 
you observing misbehavior in the application (long pauses) or just in the 
reporting?
Thanks,
Chase
