I have known a lot of incredibly creative people who have never shared 
their ideas with anyone because they feared others would steal their 
ideas and not give credit where it's due.  Maybe you think they're crazy 
for thinking that way, but evidence abounds that that sort of thing 
happens all the time.  It's very sad that so many brilliant ideas have 
never been shared with the world.  What do the "information wants to be 
free" people have to say to those people who know they're going to be 
ripped off if they open their mouths?
