Umm.  Sure.  Mount writes /etc/mtab.  To write /etc/mtab with the correct
root /dev/<foo> name, mount calls getfsfile("/").

I mean, abuseing stat by making foolish assumptions about what a dev_t contains.
In your stat code (and my evil stat example) you have violated the interface,
since you check if ((device >> 8 & 0xff) == 0) for example.  And when kdev_t
becomes a struct (which I dearly hope it does)...  boom.

Presumably, glibc uses stat hack, i.e. major=stat.st_dev>>8,
minor=stat.st_dev&0xff. I suppose if there is one piece of code where
cheating and knowing about kernel internals is acceptable, the C library
is probably it. When kdev_t becomes a struct, I can imagine some libc
hacking will be needed anyways.

hmm, could work.  Do you know where root=<foo> gets set?  That could
certainly do the job, if root=<foo>is actually set...

True, /dev/nfs might be better in that case.

My desire was to eliminate the need for /etc/mtab. I have a read-only
root filesystem on my current project, and needing a separate mtab file
when an _almost_ identical and always correct /proc/mounts file exists
led me to try and make the kernel do the Right Thing(tm).
I now have this implemented using /proc/mounts (and no
/etc/mtab), except I special case the device name, where I test
if (strcmp(deviceName, "/dev/root")==0) { 
    deviceName=(getfsfile("/"))->fs_spec); 
}
Works for now (without needing the kernel patch I sent). Of course it
would be better if I didn't need to special case /dev/root. Presumably
when the kernel starts using a struct for kdev_t, /proc/mounts can then
do the right thing.
