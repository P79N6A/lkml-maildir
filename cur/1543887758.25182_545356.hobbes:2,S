Ah, but this is something different. Both lock/unlock are full barriers,
but they protect only one direction. A memory op must not leak out of the
critical section, but it may leak in.
	A = B;		// 1
	lock();		// 2
	C = D;		// 3
this can be re-ordered to
	lock();		// 2
	C = D;		// 3
	A = B;		// 1
but 2 and 3 must not be re-ordered.
To be sure, I contacted Paul E. McKenney privately, and his reply is

Yes, but in fact I think wake_up() needs a full mb() semantics (which we
don't have _in theory_), because try_to_wake_up() first checks task->state
and does nothing if it is TASK_RUNNING.
That is why I think that smp_mb__before_spinlock() may be useful not only
for workqueue.c
