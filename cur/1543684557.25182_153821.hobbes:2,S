Greetings;
As suggested earlier, I've made the scsi support a module so
that the rest of the system can boot, and the errant scsi 
driver then modprobed in.
During the compile, these warnings are issued:
--
  CC [M]  drivers/i2c/i2c-sensor.o
drivers/i2c/i2c-sensor.c: In function `i2c_detect':
drivers/i2c/i2c-sensor.c:54: warning: `check_region' is deprecated (declared at include/linux/ioport.h:117)
--
  CC [M]  drivers/scsi/advansys.o
drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function `advansys_detect':
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:4622: warning: `check_region' is deprecated (declared at include/linux/ioport.h:117)
drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function `AscSearchIOPortAddr11':

sensors doesn't work but I can live with that for a bit.
This mobo has never run at less than 168F on the cpu,
and I have thermaltake's best on it.  The cpu runs 100%
doing setiathome full time.
However, after the bootup, an attempt to 'modprobe advansys'
will first do a bus reset, then find the tape drive as usual,
and then hang the process while attempting another bus reset.
Occasionally, not everytime, it will output a message about
a bad pointer.
And the scsi stuff I can't do without.  I have sent a msg
to what used to be advansys, but have not rx'd a reply as
its the weekend for 9-5 types.
This driver has been best described as bulletproof up till
now.
How should I proceed?
