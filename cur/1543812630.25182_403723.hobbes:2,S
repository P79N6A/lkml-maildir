It was *much* better than rc4 but it did have an error.
I *think* the problem I'm seeing is likely to be similar to the one I 
orginally reported (on 2.6.15 IIRC)
Same sporadic warning/error which didn't usually trigger the 
raid-boot-the-disk behaviour that the FUA code seemed to.

Yes. I thought the/a opcode-verbose patch was in  there but I  guess not.
I don't have remote console access to the machine so wouldn't be able to 
carry out reliable kernel tests - sorry.
Of course I'll do this as soon as I return.
