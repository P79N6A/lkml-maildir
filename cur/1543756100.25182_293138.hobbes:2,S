Sounds like dyn-tick did not get enabled then, maybe you don't have
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER, or don't have ACPI PM timer on your board?
After modifying I8042_POLL_PERIOD and leaving out CONFIG_NETFILTER
I'm getting roughly 6HZ timer rate when idle :)
$ dmesg | grep -i "time\|tick\|apic"
ACPI: PM-Timer IO Port: 0x1008
Kernel command line: root=/dev/nfs ip=dhcp ro console=ttyS0,115200
lapic init=/bin/minit
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling.
Found and enabled local APIC!
mapped APIC to ffffd000 (fee00000)

Sounds like your system is not running with the dyn-tick... I'll try
to fix that TSC bug.
