We do hard things every day, don't we?

Thinks about it creatively.
How many domains need to be able to send mail?  I suspect a tiny
fraction.
Having a domain that can be a web address and a destination for mail
is (I suspect) the greatest demand.  Having a domain that can send
mail it less important to many, but important enough to some that they
will pay.
Yes, it is hard, but if everyone says "that cannot work" we will never
move forward.  SPF may not be a big step forward, but I believe it is
a step forward (and at least it is a step!)
