yielding SERVFAIL for query:
  dig any 212.78.72.67.spews.relays.osirusoft.com. 
That in itself should not be any difficulty, but MANY
filter codes in different MTAs appear to treat that as
if there is genuine registered rejection!
I have seen this at sendmails (up to and including lattest),
and at Postfix!   But also at several systems not willing
to tell what they are running do exhibit this very same
misbehaviour.
Lots of bounces will result in lots of people getting
unsubscribed..
