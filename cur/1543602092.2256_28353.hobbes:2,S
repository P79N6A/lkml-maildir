Hi all,
	right a question on the fly regarding the meaning of this message.
I've an old Sparc Station 2 with a broken EPROM but Solaris simply
report
a warning and then boot perfectly. I was tring to install Linux today
and 
I got this message.. is there any way to force linux to boot???
Changing the EPROM is not a solution at all.
TIA
Fabio
