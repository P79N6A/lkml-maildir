Hi Andi,
Here is what I think would be a counter example :
If, at the same time, we have, on x86_64 :
parent process executing :
sys_ptrace()
  (lock_kernel())
  (ptrace_get_task_struct(pid))
  arch_ptrace()
    ptrace_detach()
      ptrace_disable(child);
        clear_singlestep(child);
          clear_tsk_thread_flag(child, TIF_SINGLESTEP);
          (which clears the TIF_SINGLESTEP  flag atomically from a 
different process)
  (put_task_struct(child))
  (unlock_kernel())
And at the same time, in the child process :
sys_execve()
  do_execve()
    search_binary_handler()
      load_elf_binary()
        flush_old_exec()
          flush_thread()
            doing a non-atomic thread flag update
Is there any protection mechanism that would protect from this race 
condition
that I have missed ?
