Hi!
Can someone explain me, why we have different define's for WRLCK and
RDLCK within alpha kernel headers:
Alpha system:
asm/fcntl.h:#define F_RDLCK             1
asm-generic/fcntl.h:#ifndef F_RDLCK
asm-generic/fcntl.h:#define F_RDLCK             0
bits/fcntl.h:#define F_RDLCK            1       /* Read lock.  */
Intel system:
asm-generic/fcntl.h:#ifndef F_RDLCK
asm-generic/fcntl.h:#define F_RDLCK             0
bits/fcntl.h:#define F_RDLCK            0       /* Read lock.  */
I would say F_RDLCK should better be 0 as in i386, but I also guess that
changing this would break many things, wouldn't it?
I don't want to tell you my (long) story, how I found that and why I was
searching for it :-(
(Jay, you know what I'm talkin' about, don't you?)
Well, maybe my kernel headers are just packaged up like crap!?
Best,
 Oliver
