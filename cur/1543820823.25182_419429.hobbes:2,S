Where do you see goto-heavy code in kernel?

"or better" part is pure BS, because there is no magic C++ compiler
can possibly do which is not implementable in C.
"as efficient", hmmm, let me see... gcc 3.4.3, presumably an contemporary
C++ compiler, i.e. which is "rather good".
Random example. gcc-3.4.3/include/g++-v3/bitset:
  template<size_t _Nw>
    struct _Base_bitset
    {
      typedef unsigned long _WordT;
      /// 0 is the least significant word.
      _WordT            _M_w[_Nw];
      _Base_bitset() { _M_do_reset(); }
...
      void
      _M_do_set()
      {
        for (size_t __i = 0; __i < _Nw; __i++)
          _M_w[__i] = ~static_cast<_WordT>(0);
      }
      void
      _M_do_reset() { memset(_M_w, 0, _Nw * sizeof(_WordT)); }
...
A global or static variable of _Base_bitset or derived type
would need an init function?! Why not just preset sequence of
zeroes in data section?
[this disproves that C++ is very efficient]
Why _M_do_set() doesn't use memset()?
Why _M_do_reset() is not inlined?
[this disproves that today's C++ libs are well-written]?

But kernel folks tend to *want to know* everything, including
names of the fields.

Because we do not like init functions which can be eliminated.
That's bloat.
