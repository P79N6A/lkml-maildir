Huh. Patch is trivial. Really trivial. Just one problem: I do not think it'll
be applied. Since it's TWO patches: one for kernel and one for GRUB.
For kernel you need this trivial patch:

Who's the bright idea was to extend maximum kernel beyond 1MB and STILL write
only two bytes of sys_size in boot sector anyway ? And why it was done via
buf in first place ?
But even then GRUB will not use full size of this field so you need equially
trivial patch for GRUB:

It's safe to do: even if build.c writing two bytes there in this place in
first sector int variable is places so it'll be four bytes long zero initially.
