	No ! Please don't do that, it will only bring madness.
	Example :
	Lucent/Agere Orinoco wireless card :
		manfid 0x0156,0x0002
		possible drivers : wlan_cs ; orinoco_cs
	Intersil PrismII and clones (Linksys, ...) :
		manfid 0x0156,0x0002
		possible drivers : prism2_cs ; hostap_cs
	Please explain me in details how your stuff will cope with the
above, and how to make sure the right driver is loaded in every case
and how user can control this.
	If your scheme can't cope with the simple real life example
above (I've got those cards on my desk, and those drivers on my disk),
then it's no good to me.
	Good luck...
	Jean
