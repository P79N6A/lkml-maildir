Is this a Red Hat machine?
If so, look in /etc/rc.sysinit.  That's where Red Hat mounts usbdevfs.
For a Debian box, it's done in /etc/hotplug/usb.rc.  I don't know where
the other distros do this, but it's probably one of the above two
places.
Don't worry, the usbdevfs name will stick around and work through 2.6,
I'm just trying to warn people that it will go away in 2.7.
Also, more recent 2.4 kernels support the usbfs name, if you want to
change the rc.sysinit file and not worry about it anymore.
Hope this helps,
