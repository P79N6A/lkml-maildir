I don't see the bug - there is an explicit "if(!prom) return -ENOMEM;" after
the allocation.  It looks fine to me.

Ah, good catch.  It'd be almost impossible to actually trigger this since
you'd need multiple cards of different types (all of which are rare) and
end up with really bad allocation luck, but it is technically a bug.
Really line 1829 should be "if(!zatm_dev) return devs;"

Yep, all three of the catches in lec.c are real bugs - great work as always.
