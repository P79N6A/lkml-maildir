What is the actual benefit here expressed in real numbers?
For the __init/__exit notation that is yet only partially correct
we often see corner cases where one ask if it is really worth it.
Adding the discard functionality for strings seems like a logical extension
but there is a benefit/pain ratio to consider.
So real numbers please.
A few general notes to the patch.
1) We want to consolidate this in include/asm-generic/vmlinux*
somehow and this should be doen as a separate step.
2) If we introduce discardable strings then we shall in parallel
add build time checks so we catch strings marked as discardable
which is used outside a discardable compatible function.
