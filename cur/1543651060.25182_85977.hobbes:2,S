Like Al mentioned... any merge of ext[23]meta would be inside ext[23].o, 
so it would be a first class object and not some random module sticking 
its fingers in there.  I looked at the locking issue too (though 
admittedly not in-depth for filesystem resize), and it's not different 
at all from existing locking, both in 2.4.x and 2.5.x.  It's 
intentionally pretty darn compatible with existing locking :)
I'll post a patch in the next couple weeks...
