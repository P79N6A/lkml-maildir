Well, modular it still /pretended/ to work. That is, it could (most of 
the time) mount CD-ROMs but yes, most any actual activity made it blow up...

Verified to do useful things here as well. I Have a CDU33A connected 
through a MediaVision PAS16 soundcard:
Pro Audio Spectrum driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
<Pro AudioSpectrum 16D rev 127> at 0x388 irq 10 dma 5
Leaving handle_sony_cd_attention at 1004
Sony I/F CDROM : SONY     CD-ROM CDU33A    Rev 1.0c
   Capabilities: tray, audio, eject, LED, elec. Vol, sep. Vol, double speed
Entering sony_get_toc
[ a great many leaving/entering and other debug printks ]
and I could actually mount CD-ROMs and copy stuff from them. One thing, 
a full 'dd' does not work:
root@5vd5:~# dd if=/dev/sonycd of=test.iso
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
root@5vd5:~# ls -l test.iso
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 0 2004-11-07 20:41 test.iso
no oopses, nor specific complaints in dmesg.
Good job though, as far as I'm concerned. Once you have a final version, 
you may want to submit this directly to Linus or maybe to Al Viro. He 
sometimes looks at these drivers. I added him to the CC...
