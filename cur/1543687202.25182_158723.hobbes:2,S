Your reasoning is backwards.
For the user the only thing that matters is that the keyboard works.
Which codes certain chips send to each other is completely irrelevant.
Everybody uses translated Set 2. It works.
Anything else gives obscure problems.
If we exchange ugly code that fails for one in a million users
for nice code that fails for one in tenthousand users,
that is no progress.

If the keyboard is in Set 3, then these keys may not give any scancode at all.
In order for the non-standard keys to work we need Set 2.
My laptop has function buttons that bring me to a setup menu where
I can set various timeouts related to power saving. These built-in
menus react to translated scancode Set 2 only. There is no way to get
out if one first chooses Set 3.
Etc. Set 3 is a pain. Nobody wants it, except the people who have read
the spec only and say - look, neat, a single code for a single keystroke.
Reality is very different.

Also disabling translation causes all kinds of obscure troubles.
It is extremely unwise to go for obscure modes that were supported by
most keyboards ten years ago, and may or may not have any support today.
