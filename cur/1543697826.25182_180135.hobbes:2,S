I have tried to compile the 2.4.23-pre9 and 2.4.23-rc4 both will not
boot this laptop.
Laptop details
intel 2.5 celeron
256 MB RAM
852GME Chipset
Slackware (if this really matters)
What I have done.
Compiled kernel 2.4.23-pre9, from fresh source. 
First try:
Intel P4 support, defaults for mostly everything, ACPI,  APM, FB,
ide-scsi, 8139too, and ICH sound.
2nd
Everything above but changed CPU to P3.
No boot (also tried with the acpi=off option in lilo.)
3rd.
rm kernel source, fresh source with 2.4.23-rc4 patch.  P4, ACPI, APM,
FB, ide-scsi, ich sound.
Same problem.
4th
Same as above but removed FB support.
No boot again.
5th
p3, no acpi, apm, no FB, ide-scsi.
Same problem.
As you can see I can't figure this out for the life of me.  I am trying
2.4.23-pre4 with out SMP.  Maybe that will work.
TIA
Dan.
