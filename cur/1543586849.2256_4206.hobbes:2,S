As long as you don't change the way the API is presented you need only to
run 'make bzImage' (or whatever you used before) from the root of a
preconfigued tree.
If you modify some functions or structures you may need to run 'make
mrproper' (cleans out all versioning info and configuration) and then run
your usual 'make ____'.
