OK.  My question was intended more to say "why /dev ?".
I don't mind cpusets using its own mini-fs.

OK, no problem.

I guess it's too late to care about FHS?
Apparently FHS needs to be updated to know about /sys and other
virtual filesystems (other than /proc, which it knows about).
However, using /dev for a virtual fs location makes no sense
to me.  /dev is defined as a place for device (or "special")
files.  Nothing about virtual filesystems (unless we want to
call virtual filesystems "special files," but I think that
"special" in this sense has its own special meaning).
Anyway, we seem to be in a mode of less general review until
after the fact (the merge) instead of when it should happen
(except for Andrew) and more adding features.
And Yes, I'm in that boat too.  I try, but there aren't
enough hours in a day (and I don't want more hours/day).
Thanks for the explanation & history.
