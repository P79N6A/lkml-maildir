One other reason:
     int fd = open("foo", O_RDWR);
     fchmod(fd, 0);
     close(fd);
Ooops!  Now how do I reset the mode of "foo"?  (Except as root...)
Same issue with stat(): just because you can't open a file doesn't mean
you should be prohibited from stat()'ing it.
Originally, Unix didn't have fchmod(), fstat(), fchown(), and so on.
When they were introduced, some old-timers protested that they encouraged
sloppy programming ("If you can't remember what you called it when you
open it, you don't deserve to be able to chmod() it").  But the f*() calls
are useful in avoiding security races, reducing path-mangling overhead,
and handling the more exotic ways of passing descriptors around.
In brief, we need 'em both.
