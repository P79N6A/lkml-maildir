I think I know what the problem is. The PCI access routines to access pci express
registers (ie reg > 256), only work if using MMCONFIG access. For some reason
your configuration doesn't want to use/allow that.
When it happened before, I ended up just not using the pci_read_config_XXX
routines and using the device map.  I'll revert the patch that started using
pci_find_ext_capabablity.
