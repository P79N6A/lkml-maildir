Myself, I don't think I have the time or capability to help much if the
corruption involves a complicated set of userspace software, especially
if you don't have a point where a regression was introduced.
I was thinking like a 100 line C program that I can reproduce here ;)
If you can even describe the steps it does: (eg. mmap file A, write(2) to
it, truncate it, ...., should contain 1s but it contains 0s!), then we
might have some suggestions to try.
One obvious thing is change filesystems or filesystem block sizes, try
ext2 or even tmpfs. Another is to try using write(2) instead of mmap to
write data.
