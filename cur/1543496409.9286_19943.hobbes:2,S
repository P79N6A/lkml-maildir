This is why libgpm exists.

No, it should be in a library, and you should link against it. Distros
can then create dependencies as necessary.
Alternatively, static link against libgpm.
The kernel provides access to the hardware. Stuff which can be done in
user space without lossage is obviously not a kernel problem.

Or in a library.
The kernel provides access to the hardware. Libraries provide the good
clean interface which "hides" the differences in hardware.
What next. X should be in the kernel because not everybody has X? libc
should be in the kernel just in case libc isn't installed?
