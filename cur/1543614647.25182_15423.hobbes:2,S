Except that, at the kernel summit this year, Linus *did* give the nod to a 
patchbot, in principle.  I could have sworn.
It seems clear that the challenge is to come up with something that really is 
so lightweight and useful that Linus will use it.  That's the 'Linus test'.  
If somebody hands him a piece of crap to use then why would we expect him to 
deviate from his normal behaviour ;-)
