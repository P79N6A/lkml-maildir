Sigh. Well, that makes two *strong* votes against it.
Nevertheless, it's been a nice experience to work on that code.
Rich: Your CPUs are great ;-)
Andi: Can you explain to me, why you think that the module would not
work on SMP ? I don't know if this is still on topic: should we discuss
this off-list ? Vielleicht auf Deutsch *G ?
