FUSE version 2.2 is out there:
  
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121684&package_id=132802&release_id=301878
This can be used standalone or with recent -mm kernels (with the
exception of -rc2-mm2).
Most notable changes since 2.1:
  - Added file handle parameter to open/read/write/release.  This
    should make life easier for filesystems wanting to implement
    stateful I/O.
  - Added compatibility to the 2.1 and to some extent to the 1.X API
  - Re-added ability to interrupt operations.  This time more
    carefully than in 1.X.
Regressions:
  - Removed shared-writable mmap support, which could deadlock the
    linux memory subsystem.  This should not affect most people, but
    if some application breaks for you, I'd like to hear about it.
  - Made the readpages() operation synchronous, again for deadlock
    considerations.  This can degrade performance, especially for high
    latency filesystems, since previously parallel read-ahead is now
    serialized.
In the long run I hope to solve both problems, but neither is trivial.
Ideas are welcome, as well as bugreports of course.
Thanks,
Miklos
