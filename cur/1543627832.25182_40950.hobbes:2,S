well, looks like it's really latest nvidia driver issue. i found out that
few people from polish linux newsgroup also encountered this problem 
(different systems, same nv 1.0.2880). i booted up with native X driver,
as Alan Cox recommended and everything worked fine for couple of hours. 
then i downgraded them drivers to 2313 and again - no probs, at least 
until now ;).
thank you for your help,
artb.
