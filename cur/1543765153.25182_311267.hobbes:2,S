Hi ;) I have found cool site. There are many games for PC. It's all downloadable. Purchase and instantly download. I have
already downloaded 15 games.
It's more convient, then to buy in a shop - You save a lot money! All games are new, for example
Half-Life 2
Alexander
Codename: Panzers
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
The Sims 2and more
Doom3
This is cool! That URL www.shopgamers.biz/gate.php?sid=cWoZdeuD&pj=544
