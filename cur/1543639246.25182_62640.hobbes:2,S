Yes, exactly. If you really believe that ide# (or even hd#) numbering 
should change according to the BIOS boot order, then there is certainly 
nothing we can agree on. And if I boot from floppy or SCSI, should IDE
code skip ide0/hda at all?
Maybe you did not notice that Linux can boot of /dev/hde, it does not 
have to boot from /dev/hda. Just tell to LILO where /dev/hde lives (and 
there are patches for EDD support, but adding two lines into /etc/lilo.conf 
is easier than patching support for EDD structure, which is broken in 50% 
of BIOSes I know anyway).
