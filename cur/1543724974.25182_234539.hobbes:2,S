[PATCH] I2C: remove Documentation for i2c-pport

> No we should not.

-Primitive parallel port is driver for i2c bus, which exploits 
-features of modern bidirectional parallel ports. 
-
-Bidirectional ports have particular bits connected in following way:
-   
-                        |
-            /-----|     R
-         --o|     |-----|
-      read  \-----|     /------- Out pin
-                      |/
-                   - -|\
-                write   V
-                        |

-It means when output is set to 1 we can read the port. Therefore 
-we can use 2 pins of parallel port as SDA and SCL for i2c bus. It 
-is not necessary to add any external - additional parts, we can 
-read and write the same port simultaneously.
-	I only use register base+2 so it is possible to use all 
-8 data bits of parallel port for other applications (I have 
-connected EEPROM and LCD display). I do not use bit Enable Bi-directional
- Port. The only disadvantage is we can only support 5V chips.
-
-Layout:
-
-Cannon 25 pin
-
-SDA - connect to pin 14 (Auto Linefeed)
-SCL - connect to pin 16 (Initialize Printer)
-GND - connect to pin 18-25
-+5V - use external supply (I use 5V from 3.5" floppy connector)
-      
-no pullups  requied
-
-Module parameters:
-
-base = 0xXXX
-XXX - 278 or 378
-
-That's all.
