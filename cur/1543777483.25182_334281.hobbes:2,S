And who says that couldn't change?
In my oppinion it would be nice if Linus/Andrew had some basic
regression tests they could run on kernels before releasing them.
There are plenty of "Linux test" projects out there that could be
borrowed from to create some sort of regression test harness for them
to run prior to release.   It would be super nice if they had a suite
of tests to run and could then drop a mail on lkml saying 2.6.x is
almost ready to go, but it currently fails regression tests #x, #y &
#z, we need to get those fixed first before we can release this - and
then every time a bug was found that could resonably be tested for in
the future it would be added to the regression test suite...  That
would lead to more consistent quality I believe.
