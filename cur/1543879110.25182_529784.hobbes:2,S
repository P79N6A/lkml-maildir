I don't think so. But this might:
menu "foobar"
 config FOOBAR
   bool "foobar"
   default y
 config HW_RANDOM
   depends on FOOBAR
   default FOOBAR
endmenu

I think you mean "exhibits"?

You are replacing the depends with an if block, which seems to add 
complexity, as we now have two constructs, if and depends.
IMHO, leave the depends as is, for simplicity and correctness and 
maintainability.
So if we have something like this:
menu "foobar"
 config FOOBAR
   bool "foobar"
   default y
 config FOOBAR_SUB1
   tristate "FOOBAR SUB1"
   depends on FOOBAR
   default m
 config FOOBAR_SUB2
   bool "FOOBAR SUB2"
   depends on FOOBAR
   default y
endmenu
Change it to something like this:
menuconfig FOOBAR
   tristate "foobar"
   default y
 config FOOBAR_SUB1
   tristate "FOOBAR SUB1"
   depends on FOOBAR
   default FOOBAR
 config FOOBAR_SUB2
   bool "FOOBAR SUB2"
   depends on FOOBAR
   default FOOBAR
without any if blocks, and maybe even in its own Kconfig.
Thanks!
