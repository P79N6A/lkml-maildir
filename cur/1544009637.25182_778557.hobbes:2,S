Sincerely, this is just blatantly copied over from the equivalent ext2
function.

As above, just copied over, I tried to keep the code as similar as
possible so to make it clear that it's a copy-paste.

Okay, I think I was able to reproduce this both in "production" (as in,
making use of this in my real system) and on my testing virtual machine.
I'll get it fixed.

Yes I noticed, my reason to change the comment was that the code
actually only tests fh_to_dentry (while the comment on ext2 structure
says that get_parent is the only needed one).
