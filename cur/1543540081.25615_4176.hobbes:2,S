I don't think we want to do this!  IMO, HZ should not get exported to
user space *AT ALL*.  Instead, for the few interfaces that need it,
we'll export a "user space HZ" (USER_HZ) which is fixed.  No need for
a kernel hack.  When we support nonstandard values for HZ, we need to
fix the few interfaces that actually export jiffies values to convert
from "user jiffies" to real jiffies.
