Hello all,
In linux/Documentation/networking/policy-routing.txt theres an
"Important Note" from AK about a compiletime-switch which should do
exactly what I need... unfortunately this note seems to be outdated, at
least I couldn't find it in route.c
So what's the current status, are locally originated packets
policy-routed or aren't they, and if they aren't is there a way to
change this behaviour?
TIA
Florian Heinz
