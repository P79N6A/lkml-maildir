But that won't work because the compiler can still cache &per_cpu__x.
I guess I have to do this:
#define __get_cpu_var(var, cpu)					\
	(*(__typeof__(&per_cpu__##var))({			\
		void *__ptr;					\
		asm("addi %0,13,per_cpu__"#var"@tprel"		\
		    : "=r" (__ptr));				\
		__ptr;						\
	}))
That means we lose the possible optimization of combining the addi
into a following load or store.  Bah.  However, I guess it's still
better than what we do at the moment.
Paul.
