Hello!
I would like to know a few things about making the ipv4 code modular. I've been
working on a school assignment that requires implementing tunneling, but first
ipv4 must be modularized... it needs to be done using kernel 2.4.20
I see Eric Schenk tried to do it on an earlier kernel version (
http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/mail-archive/LinuxNetdev/1997-03/0218.html
), a few years ago. What should I consider for a start, and how hard can it be
in the end?
I've experienced a lot of undefined symbol references which are linked to core
kernel files!, isn't there a way to access these symbols from the module into
the kernel while executing?
Thanks in advance
Alexander Chacon
