Okay, I was missing that, thanks
So, i suspended to disk the first time and it seemed to suspend
properly, then I hit the power button on the thinkpad and it took me to
the thinkpad screen, back to grub, and booted the OS from the beginning.
 Did I resume the wrong way?
So, after it rebooted, i tried to suspend it to disk again:
x60s gnychis # echo platform > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state
bash: echo: write error: No such device
So now it won't even suspend to disk.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
George
