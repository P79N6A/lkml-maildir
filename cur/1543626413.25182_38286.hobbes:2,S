Vaguely. And calling them "celts" is the historical community equivalent of
saying "emacs is the one true editor".
The origin is all a bit of mystery but it appears to be From c16 French and
was adopted over time in the UK and then copied by the US. Lots of parts of
the world have different dates (Spain, Mexico its Dec 28th) - historically
Rome celebrated a similar event very late March (Hilaria) and the end of
Holi in India is also the end of March.
Bizarrely enough all this came up in the localisation of at least one Gnome
program
