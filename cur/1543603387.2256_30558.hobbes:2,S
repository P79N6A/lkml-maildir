ok. i was also mislead by a quick hack in the source code :)

i think something like: 'offloading hardirq work into softirqs' covers the
concept better, right?

i like this approach very much, and indeed this is not polling in any way.
i'm worried by the dev->quota variable a bit. As visible now in the
2.4.10-poll.pat and tulip-NAPI-010910.tar.gz code, it keeps calling the
->poll() function until dev->quota is gone. I think it should only keep
calling the function until the rx ring is fully processed - and it should
re-enable the receiver afterwards, when exiting net_rx_action.
