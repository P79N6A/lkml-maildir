I general it means that it has a 64 bit address space. You can always do
non-32 bit operations on a 32 bit platform: load a single byte is one of
them (of course given that the CPU can do it).

The length of the data bus is independent of the CPU. For instance: the
80386SX processor was a 32 bit processor with a 16 bit databus so it could
be used with the cheaper 80286 compatible support chips. This was of
course slower because a single 32 bit load or store had to be divided into
two 16 bit load/stores.

The OS doesn't prevent you to do it. Unless... the OS only saves 32 of the
64 bits in a register during a context switch. No problem when you run
a single process using 64 bit registers, but as soon as you use two, they
will most likely be messed up.

As long as you use only one of those programs.
Which CPU/OS combination do you have in mind?
