It pulls a non-local cacheline into the local thread, that's extremely
expensive on SMP.
If everyone starts grabbing this thing during recvmsg() it's going to
become a really hot lock and kill performance, even if it's a read
side lock being taken.
That's why I said we need to investigate solutions involving
u->readlock, that already has to be taken and is local to the socket.
