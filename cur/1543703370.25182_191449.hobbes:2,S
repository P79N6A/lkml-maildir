        Hi Marcelo,
	Two IrDA patch that I want to submit for 2.4.25.
	It is basically the backport of two drivers from the 2.6.X
kernel that are very popular amongst IrDA users. I reverted back the
alloc_irdadev patch in the VIA driver so it matches other 2.4.X
drivers.
	Those patches have been tested in 2.6.X and 2.4.24, and only
impact the driver themselves, so are safe.
	Thanks in advance.
	Jean
