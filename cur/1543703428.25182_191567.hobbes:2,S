Yes, the structure info for each physical disk allows for two (and
only 2) paths to be represented.  But it's pretty limited, describing
only SCSI-like paths with bus/id/lun only described in the current
draft.  At the same time, there's a per-physical-disk GUID, such
that if you find the same disk by multiple paths you can tell.
There's room for enhancment/feedback in this space for certain.  
Thanks,
Matt
