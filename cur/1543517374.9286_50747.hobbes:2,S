VESA-2 compilant BIOSes introduced protected mode interface for video
functions except (afaik) mode switching but it's needed only once.
And if linear frame buffer is supported by your card, you have got the same
memory mapped video ram area like with non-vesa frame buffer, isn't it ? 
I don't understand the differnece between vesa and non-vesa frame buffer and
why do you lock interruppts ?
