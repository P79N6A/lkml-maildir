I repeat myself, fighting is apparently so pleasant that you are stuck on
fighting over dead-end technology:
  I seriously suggest that for the primary (subject given) topic
  you are SERIOUSLY OFF TARGET.  Look around, counting hits on
  some fw rules is waste of time!  (And mightly inaccurate!)
  You absolutely don't want to do any sort of counting aggeration policy
  control within kernel ( = FW rules ).   You want to collect accounting
  per flow, and send those data records to offline analysis.
  No more fighting of when to clear counters, and when not.
  Having used (with own custom analyzers) cisco netflow, I can say
  that any sort of "count hits on access-list elements" things are
  from stone-age:

  Yet another nice thing to cook up -- if I had time ...
