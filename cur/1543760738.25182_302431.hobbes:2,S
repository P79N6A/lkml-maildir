somewhat; it would even make sense to consider dual licensing that thing
(like most other not-originally-gpl code in the kernel) to clarify the
legal status for real. Otherwise if you merge it with GPL it sort of
becomes GPL only.. (due to the freedom of MIT and the viral nature of
GPL) and I suspect the intention of the author was to keep allowing MIT
use...
