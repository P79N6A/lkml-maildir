Can you stop this tirade, e.g. conspiracy theory,
in regards to LSI/MPT and the transport layer?
That is not the case.   There will be other sas 
solutions that implement discovery, and 
sas/sata translation in firmware, higher level
event handling.

Have you forgotten about CSMI/SDI?  It was
nearly a year ago I got blasted when I posted
a sas driver with all those IOCTLs.  CSMI/SDI
is more than a "nice to have" feature.
Its taken quite a bit of time(and greif)
to re-design the driver so it will work with
the transport layers in the way people on this
forum wanted it. Trust me, its been painful.

I just don't have time to engage you.
I've got work to do, customer requests, issues,
etc.
