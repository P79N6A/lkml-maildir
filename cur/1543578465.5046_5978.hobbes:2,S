It took a little while for the following to dawn on me: it's not hard to
make the dnotify scheme work recursively and you don't have to keep 3000
directories open.  To modify a file you must have opened all the
directories in its path.  We need a new event: 
        DN_OPEN       A file in the directory was opened
You open the top level directory and register for events.  When somebody
opens a subdirectory of the top level directory, you receive
notification and register for events on the subdirectory, and so on,
down to the file that is actually modified.
