That test was already there. I don't know under what circumstances (if
any) it is correct. So I left it in, and added the test which worked under
both the 1542CF and 1542CP controllers I had.

Unfortunately I cannot tell you the exact controller revision as things
have been moved around since then.  I got annoyed at the unwanted 255x63
geometry and swapped controllers with test kernels until I was satisfied
that my fix was correct.

Yes. The disk is probably a Seagate ST34572N (~4 gigs).

No.

If you like I can pull out a few controllers and test again. I should
have a few spare (soon afterward I "discovered" that the AIC7xxx controller
performance leaves the 1542 series for dead).
Nick.
