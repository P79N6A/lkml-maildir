there's no get_request_wait_wakeup in blkdev_release_request. I put the
construct in both places though (i've the clear_queue_full explicit as
q->full = 0).
And I don't think any of your barriers is needed at all, I mean, we only
need to be careful to clear it right, we don't need to be careful to set
or read it right when it transits from 0 to 1. And the above seems
enough to me to get right the clearing.

__get_request makes perfect sense of course and it's needed, this is not
the issue, my point about the waited check is that the last writer has
to get the wakeup (and the wakeup has nothing to do with the waited
check since waited == 0), and after the wakeup it will get the request
and it won't re-run the loop, so I don't see why waited is needed.
Furthmore even if for whatever reason it doesn't get the request, it
will re-set full to 1 and it'll be still the first to get the wakeup,
and it will definitely get another wakeup if none request was available.
