I am using kernel 2.3.36, and I am no longer able to build bash. I get
the following error when trying to build bash 2.03. I previously built
this sucessfully (though I cannot remember which kernel I was then
using) last October. I have not updated either the compiler (gcc
2.95.2) nor glibc (2.1.2) since last trying to build bash. I am using
a Pentium.
rm -f shell.o
gcc  -DPROGRAM='"bash"' -DCONF_HOSTTYPE='"i586"' -DCONF_OSTYPE='"linux-gnu"' -DCONF_MACHTYPE='"i586-pc-linux-gnu"' -DCONF_VENDOR='"pc"' -DSHELL -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64  -I.  -I. -I./lib -I/usr/local/include -g -O2 -c shell.c
In file included from shell.h:26,
                 from shell.c:53:
general.h:189: parse error before `string_to_rlimtype'
general.h:189: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
general.h:190: parse error before `int'
make: *** [shell.o] Error 1
I had the same problem (on a new system) running 2.3.35, so I suspect
that maybe a kernel change has caused the problem.
Has anyone else either seen this problem or been able to build bash
2.03 with the latest 2.3.x kernels?
