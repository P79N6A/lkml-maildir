I won't be able to test and report until tomorrow afternoon (CET),
please be patient.

this is another shot of the same oops caught some days ago
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/dsc03133.jpg
unfortunately it happened while running X so that's all I currently
have... and I can't remember now about the BUG.
oh, and BTW I have / and /usr on reiserfs while /home is xfs and I can
easily reproduce the oops by starting X (with a simple user so fiddling
in /home) and then installing and removing software in /usr.
thanks.
