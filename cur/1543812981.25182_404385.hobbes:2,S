Nope. If you have a cache coherent architecture like x86, ALSA mmaps 
directly the DMA buffer to application and even pointers to this buffer 
are mmaped, thus there is no content switch when apps are doing r/w and 
there is "zero data copy". The only contents switch is when apps call
poll(), but you should do it, otherwise you'll eat all cpu time.

Using /proc? Where? I've not noticed it :-)
