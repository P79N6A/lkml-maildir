To enable secure direct rendering on current hardware (ie without secure 
command submission mechanisms), you need command valididation somewhere.  This 
could be a layer on top of the minimal dma engine Linus describes.

You mean like the programmable fragment and vertex hardware that has been in 
use for a couple of years now?
