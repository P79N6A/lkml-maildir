I haven't yet seen a good explanation of what this is or does,
but I suspect it may be useful for the "top" program or for a
debugger. In either case, I am a highly interested party.
I maintain top as part of the procps package. People pay me to
hack on debuggers.
Mind pointing me to some documentation and an explanation of why
the feature was added? Is there a man page? (there should be)
Perhaps there is no need to support 32-bit apps using this on
64-bit systems. Obviously the 32-on-64 nonsense must include
full debugger support (else you can't work on it very well),
and I suppose there is a desire to support various proprietary
bits of junk like the Flash player, but... there is a place to
just draw the line.
