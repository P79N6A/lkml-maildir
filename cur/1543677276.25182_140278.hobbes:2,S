Does Linux support the Xeon (p4) processor and its capabilities?
The company I work for recently ported its application to Linux and one 
of our current HP clients asked this and I figure it would be just a 
recompile the kernel as a P4, but not sure if this would do it.
I'm not asking if Linux can RUN the Xeon processor.
I'm asking if Linux processor takes any advantage of the Hyper-Threading 
built into this processor?
below is a link to more info on this.
