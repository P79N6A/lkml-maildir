Also, I think Larry would find it difficult to 'slowly' break SCCS
compatibility. It either works, or it doesn't.
As somebody in a similar field, I find it odd that Larry bothered to
keep SCCS compatibility in the first place. If anything, it holds him
back for only questionable gain. It would not be unreasonable for
Larry to license an extractor utility under looser restrictions than
BK.
