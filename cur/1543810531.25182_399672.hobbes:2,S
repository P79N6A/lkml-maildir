Okey dokey, bisecting with mrproper took little longer than expected but
I found the bad changeset:
033b96fd30db52a710d97b06f87d16fc59fee0f1 is first bad commit

    [PATCH] remove mount/umount uevents from superblock handling
    The names of these events have been confusing from the beginning
    on, as they have been more like claim/release events. We needed these
    events for noticing HAL if storage devices have been mounted.
    Thanks to Al, we have the proper solution now and can poll()
    /proc/mounts instead to get notfied about mount tree changes.

Reverting the above from yesterday's git head fixes the problem for me
and I get my Ipod icon in Gnome again. I am running udev 079, dbus 060,
hal 0.5.5.1, and gnome-volume-manager 1.5.4 on Gentoo/x86. The patch
should probably be reverted for 2.6.16 because it breaks userspace.
