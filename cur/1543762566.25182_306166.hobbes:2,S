I was able to reproduce this on ext3.  Seven instances of the above leaked
10-15MB over 10 hours.  All of it permanently stuck on the LRU.
I'll continue to poke at it - see what kernel it started with, which
filesystems it affects, whether it happens on UP&&!PREEMPT, etc.  Not a
quick process.
Given that you also saw it on reiserfs, it might be a bug in the core
mmap/truncate/unmap handling.  We'll see.

I haven't noticed anything like that.
