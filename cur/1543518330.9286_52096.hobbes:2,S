Yes, I saw this patch later. Linux-kernel arrived out-of-order here yesterday.

Of course you have key down and key up at the keycode level.
value < 128 is key down, value+128 is key up.

You misunderstand my argument. It is not that I expressed concern
about the key-up event. Just the opposite - I was happy to notice
that the key up event has occurred already after 100ms, so your
repetition test has already changed last_keycode after 100 ms,
so a longer period is only required for people who are both very
slow typists and have a broken Toshiba keyboard.
On the other hand 250ms is definitely too long - all keyboards I have
here start repeating somewhat earlier than that.

It kills the key repeat on my keyboard.

I don't understand your argument.
Your constraints are the following:
1. You want a time period that is as long as possible, in order to catch
as many glitches as possible.
2. The time period must not be longer than the ordinary key repeat delay.
3. The time period need not be longer than the time until the next key-up
in normal typing. For me that is much less than 100 ms, but other people
may have different opinions.
Now fast key repeat is important - especially for backspace and arrow keys -
it would be a bad idea to kill a little bit of the Linux pleasure just
because of some obscure Toshiba bug. So 250 ms is definitely too long.
