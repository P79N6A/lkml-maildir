This is just normal. Either the CD-Rs are burned in TAO mode or your
writer has problems with DAO (mine has the same problems). See
README.verify. Every such disc has two unreadable "run-out" sectors. If
this happens with -dao, try -raw96r.

BTW: Can you successsfully burn CD-Rs with > 2.5.45? If so, could you
send me your .config please?
