Not quite.  There were two non-driver suggestions that the man did 
make:  remove 386/486 support and remove floating-point emulation 
support.  Both are bad for the embedded-systems space, because the 486 is 
still used there widely.
Are all the bus support code exclusively in drivers, or is there something 
compiled into the nucleus for start-up?
I didn't see your "don't feed the troll" sign before...
