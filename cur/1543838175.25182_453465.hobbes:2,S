Yes, it can cause lots of trouble when you try to compile external
modules on a different system with different compiler than on the
system where the kernel was compiled.
e.g. you upgrade a distribution kernel but now you can compile
modules for it because the new rpm was compiled with a newer 
compiler.
Happens to me regularly.
