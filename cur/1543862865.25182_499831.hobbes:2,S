The problem there is that we do a GFP_ATOMIC allocation (no allocation 
context) that may fail when the first page is dirtied. We must therefore 
be able to subsequently allocate the nodemask_t in set_page_dirty(). 
Otherwise the first failure will mean that there will never be a dirty 
map for the inode/mapping.
