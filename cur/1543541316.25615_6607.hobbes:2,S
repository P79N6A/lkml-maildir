Shrug.  Each FS has features the others don't, and it doesn't make much 
sense to limit our options because some day soon someone else might be 
kind enough to make their well known FS stable in linux, and get it 
accepted into the kernel.  Both XFS and JFS have good teams of 
developers, and the end result is that all the linux filesystems are 
going to benefit from the competition.
