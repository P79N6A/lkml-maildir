Not so unusual. It's Itanium2 SMP machine (4cpus to 32cpus).
The problem have occured at first after I run a very large multi-threaded
program for days.
To investigate the problem, I made a small program which allocate
memory and then create some threads to access the shared space in parallel.
It makes shared pages swapped in and out with very high frequency.
Running it with small free memory situation, the program could cause
the oops in a few minutes on 4cpu machine.

main(int argc, char** argv)

        void *v;
        pthread_t tid[NPROC];
        ptr=malloc(SIZE);
        memset(ptr, 0, SIZE);
        for(i=0; i<NPROC; i++){
                pthread_create((pthread_t *)&tid[i],
                                (pthread_attr_t *)NULL,
                                loop,
                                (void *)NULL);
        }
        for(i=0; i<NPROC; i++)
                pthread_join(tid[i], (void**)NULL);
        return 0;
}

I hope the patch will be taken in next 2.4 release.
Best regards.
