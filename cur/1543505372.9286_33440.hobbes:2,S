Consider yourself lucky. I've lost both keyboard and mouse,
sometimes on the same occasion - so that only a hard reset
with associated fsck marathon would fix the situation.
Might have something to do with edge/level triggered ints
though, because my mainboard/kernel combo don't always seem
to agree on the actual configuration.
Then again, my mainboard is just weird :)
