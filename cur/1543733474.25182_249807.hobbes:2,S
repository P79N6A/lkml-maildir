Does that mean that you're ok with the first three patches?

ok.

How about the loop in 3/4?

Makes sense, as long as any disk filesystem can decide to add a
one-liner like
	.copy = generic_file_copy;
to their operations and explicitly allow this.  Cowlinks remain my pet
project, even if I get distracted by Real Work sometimes.  Without
some form of in-kernel copy, they'd be dead in the water.
