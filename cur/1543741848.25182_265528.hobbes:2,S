DMA is restored, and the resulting is way slower than what PIO would
explain anyway. I get less than 100Kb/sec !
(I wrote the IDE suspend/resume code and the driver for this chipset, so
I'm fairly sure that side is ok, it didn't change for a while, but I'll
double check in case Bart latest updates broke something).

Tried all of that.
