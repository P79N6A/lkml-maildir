First of all, if you want to do normal printing, you shouldn't switch on
LP console. From there on, all kernel debug output (as seen in
/var/log/kern.log and outputted with "dmesg") would be sent to the
printer, what isn't exactly what you want to have.

Another gotcha may be that your printer doesn't easily accept commands.
Many printers don't do that nowadays. Some are dumb GDI-Printerts
(Windows-only, that is...), some nees specific wake-up sequences.
