It's more complicated than that, I'd say. If the job of the elevator was
purely to sort request based on sector criteria, then I'd agree that
noop was the best way to go. But the elevator also abritrates access to
the disk for processes. Even if you don't pay a seek penalty, you still
would rather like to get your sync reads in without having to wait for
that huge writer that just queued hundreds of megabytes of io in front
of you (and will have done so behind your read, making you wait again
for a subsequent read).
My plan in this area is to add a simple storage profile and attach it to
the queue. Just start simple, allow a device driver to inform the block
layer that this device has no seek penalty. Then the io scheduler can
make more informed decisions on what to do - eg for ssd, sector
proximity may not have much meaning, so we should not take that into
account.
