And what if the condition have changed after we have checked it in 
wait_event() but
before calling __wait_event() and before putting the process into the wait 
queue ?
The process could not be woken up "in advance" , right ?
#define wait_event(wq, condition)        \
do {                                                   \
        if (condition)                                \
                break;                                 \
   /* and here we have condition changed  ???? */
        __wait_event(wq, condition);        \
} while (0)
