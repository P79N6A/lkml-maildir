Hi,
Imagine you are doing this:
1. Load a kernel module (any will do)
2. Generate kernel map (ksymoops -s map < /dev/null)
3. Note a few interesting data structures in the map and write
   a trivial C program to dump them by reading off /dev/kmem. It
   obviously works for addresses both in the statically linked and
   modules (which are vmalloc()'d).
4. Now try to do the same in gdb (2.3.26-pre2 or later with ELF 
/proc/kcore) and observe that it will fail for module addresses:
(gdb) p *(struct file_system_type *)0xc01db9cc
$5 = {name = 0xc01ba940 "devpts", fs_flags = 0, read_super = 0xc014f768 
<devpts_read_super>, 
  next = 0xc4815b6c}
(gdb) p *(struct file_system_type *)0xc4815b6c
Cannot access memory at address 0xc4815b6c.
Why does it fail? Because we prevent it ourselves in 
fs/proc/kcore.c:read_kcore():
    size = ((size_t)high_memory - PAGE_OFFSET) + PAGE_SIZE;
    if (buflen==0 || *fpos>=size)
            return 0;
Now let us look at /dev/kmem read() method (read_kmem() in 
drivers/char/mem.c) and see that it is using vread() in general
and does something else if (p<(unsigned long)high_memory).
So, what is your advice on how to proceed in allowing /proc/kcore
to access module's address space? use vread()? (tried - didn't work).
make read_kmem() not static? not nice (but it doesn't work either).
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Tigran.
