Actually, I don't think I am missing the point. Usually if you want to do
sound stuff with Linux, you'd better include <linux/soundcard.h> or
whatever. The problem is that it is not portable. I want portability - so
any one can port it to *BSD (for example) and expect a similiar interface.
And besides, I think the libc folks won't accept changes like that anyway
- they are far more concerned with portability of the libc functionality
across different ports - and most of these probably won't have sound
hardware installed. 
The only real way to guarantee this is to have an universal user-space
interface that abstracts the sound hardware in such a way that one would
expect to play a Micro$hit .WAV file on Solaris or whatever. Then people
can use the facilities provided simply by doing #include
<multimedia/sound.h> or whatever and they can be sure it will abstract
<linux/soundcard.h>. 
Maybe.. I don't know.. it's getting off-topic anyway.
Cheers,
Alex
