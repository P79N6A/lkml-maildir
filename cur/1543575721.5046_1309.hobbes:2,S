IKD is a debugging toolkit.  The trap I have set up freezes the kernel
trace buffer at SIGSEGV time.  From there you have to read it backward
looking for problems. (which isn't particularly easy).  I was thinking
you wanted to roll your shirt sleeves up and maybe this would help ;-)  
If you want it, and do a trace, I'b be very interested in the last
couple of schedules to compare to my traces.  It's not something you
can just run and report though.
