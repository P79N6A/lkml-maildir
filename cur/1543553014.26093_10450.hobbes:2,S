There is a deficiency in modversions which has been there since the
start.  Symbol versions assume that the kernel header files and the
module version file are in sync but this has never been guaranteed.  I
have seen people compile (outside the kernel) with headers from kernel
2.2.x and modversions from kernel 2.3.x, the checksums "match" the 2.3
kernel so the module loaded but they used the wrong headers, splat!
As part of the 2.5 kbuild redesign, symbol versions will be completely
redone.  One of the things on my todo list is to detect this mismatch.
There are some problems in doing that which I may or may not be able to
overcome, but if the field names are different between C and C++ then I
can never detect this mismatch correctly.
Please do not use different structure field names in kernel and modules.
