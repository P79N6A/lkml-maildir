Does reverting Willy's borken patch fix it? That patch was clearly never
actually tested before Linus applied it.
I can see 2 problems in the NFS code alone:
  1) Replacing a test for whether or not O_APPEND and O_DIRECT are
*both* set with one that checks whether either is set.
  2) Adding a wonderful check in nfs_open() that causes it to return
immediately if this new nfs_check_flags() returns 0 (i.e. OK).
GRRRR
