I'm using an Abit KT7 board (KT133) and my new 1GHz T'bird (running 50-60°C
in a warm room) is giving me no trouble.  This is with the board and RAM
pushed as fast as it will go without actually overclocking anything...  and
yes, I do have Athlon/K7 optimisations turned on in my kernel (2.4.3).
Out of interest, what FSB are you using for your machine?  I understand the
difference between the KT133 and the KT133A is that the latter supports a
266MHz FSB for the Athlon rather than 200MHz.  Since your CPU is running
cool, I doubt you've managed to accidentally o/c it, but nevertheless this
is a possibility...
The 266MHz FSB does require considerably higher standards in board
construction though, so it could be that IWILL have managed to do a shoddy
job on that end.
