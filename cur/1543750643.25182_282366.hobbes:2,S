I don't like this one, it's much less obvious than 1/2. After your
obviously right 1/2 we're already guaranteed at least a percentage of
the ram will not be dirty. Is the below really needed even after 1/2 +
Andrew's fix? Are you sure this isn't a workaround for the lack of
Andrew's fix.
This 2/2 is absolutely generic, not related to highmem, and I'm at least
not having problem with Andrew's patch applied.
The conditional to out_of_memory especially looks not good, and I'm
scared it could generate livelocks.
I'm going to apply both your 1/2 and I already applied Andrew's
total_scanned, but from my part I'm not applying this 2/2. I believe to
be already safe with total_scanned + 1/2.
