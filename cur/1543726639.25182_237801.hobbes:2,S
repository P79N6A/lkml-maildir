Well, the user unmount of mount.cifs user mounts works on Suse
Workstation with their default umount (the minor change I made was to
/sbin/mount.cifs to add the "user=" that Randy suggested to
mount.cifs.c), even though not on my Fedora install, might be something
slightly different about the Fedora umount or some obscure user error.
