But it would do, what we expect. VLAN on a e.g. unpatched tulip driver is somewhat unpredictable.
You can hope any application is using small packets, but if not things get worse.

This sounds very "experimental". What about the non-VLAN packets on eth0, when you set the MTU
1504?
I like the NETIF_F_VLAN_CHALLENGED capability in the driver itself, which is then tested by the net subsystem on
creation of a VLAN. No more tweaks and fiddling around with MTU and framesizes.
