Sure, but this looks like independent task from the case I have with
ES7000. We don't have ACPI add/eject methods in AML to bring up new
processors so far (also thinking of implementing them). The IA64 code
also disregards the disabled processors, but ES7000 hot plug mechanism
only supports and relies on this deterministic method of topologically
pre-allocating APIC IDs by the platform.
Thanks,
