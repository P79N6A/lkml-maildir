Subject: [patch] bootmem bitmap always considered dma memory

Currently when we go to free the bootmem bitmap we don't check if it's
really allocated in dma memory. This bug will almost sure trigger on NUMA
architectures where the bitmaps of secondary nodes will be allocated at
offsets probably over 16g.
Patch against 2.3.31:
