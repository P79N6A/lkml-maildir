I did not see degraded performance but tested it anyway with my shm
stress tests.
2.3.99-pre3 is the first release which handles 11.5GB shared mem
trashing on my 8GB machine without choking.
But adding your patch leads again to random process killed and other
oom situations when it has to go into swap.
