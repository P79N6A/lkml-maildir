I've been running a UP machine with 2.0.36, then 2.0.38 without any
problems, as a workstation at home. Now that I have an SMP machine,
I moved it as a file server, DNS, etc... (but not a firewall, I have
an old 486 for that).
Well, since 3 weeks, I've been having messages looking like the
following (I've added "uname -a" output):

The machine stays up, but I'm uncomfortable with this.
Since the machine is a server, it must remain up and running 24/7,
as well as reliable in its behaviour...
My questions are simple:
1) Is this problem known?
2) Should I downgrade to 2.0.36?
3) Should I upgrade to 2.2.13?
My SMP machine runs 2.2.13 but experiences "network lockup"
(i.e. it looses its connection on the LAN, but stays otherwise up),
but it could be an SMP-only problem.
Thank you for your advice, and, if possible, for pointers to
more information about this behaviour.
