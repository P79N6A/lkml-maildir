So why it is oopses then?
Also, we don't want this data to arrive late or whatever.
fast_copy_page must copy page (make it so that memcpy()==0).
If it does not, it is too much "optimized".

A better way to do it is to bencmark several routines at
startup time and pick the best one. It is done now
for RAID xor'ing routine.
