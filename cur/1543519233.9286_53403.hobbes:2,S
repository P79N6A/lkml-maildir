Hi,
had a lockup in 2.2.14pre13 this morning, on a hardware-wise very
stable machine. Sys-Rq still worked and after reboot I found this in
the logs:
Dec 15 09:10:44 oberon kernel: hdd: buffer list corrupted
Nothing else.
Can somebody please enlighten me what it really means and what may
have caused it? hdd holds a partition that was mounted but unused at
the time and it holds a swap partition (striped, same pri as hdb). The
system started swapping and then froze.
Ask me if you need more info. (Mind, I am on lk-digest).
