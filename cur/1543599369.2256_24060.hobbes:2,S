I used the inb() function.

My card is at 1000h, that's something i know for sure, because I can
probe the EISA ID at 0x1000+0xc80.

I guess you mean X0000h-X0FFF; X1000-X1FFF; ...

Tnx for the tip!  I will check it out!
I also found this URL: 
http://uw7doc.sco.com/cgi-bin/man/man?eisa
+D4
It comes from UnixWare 7 documentation and there they have the kind of
translation that I want to do (that is: translate INT 15h call "Read
Function" (AH=D8h, AL=01h)) to linux.  As i understood there isn't
such thing available for linux?  Meaning I'll have to try and
implement that stuff myself?  But then the problem remains: how do i
get to the data that is in the 320 byte buffer returned from an INT
15h call "Read Function" (AH=D8h, AL=01h)
