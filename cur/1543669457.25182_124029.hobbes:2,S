No. VAX/VMS is dead. It got killed by things like that. Canned
strings that required valuable resources. You don't need any
of that. You need to use the kernel logging facility for the
three or four messages that a properly running system will
issue in its lifetime (like the file-system getting full).
There are too many damn strings in the kernel already. Making
them somehow legitimate is the wrong approach. If there are
so many error messages that we need a translation service, then
there are too many error messages, either because there are too
many errors, or because of the propensity of 'coders' (as opposed
to software engineers) to "print" every *%&$#@&#%_ thing that they
don't understand. Don't get me started, but when was it decided
that you should "print" everything that went okay? I saw during
the past month that somebody wanted to increase the size of
the kernel message ring buffer because they were losing
"important" data. They should fix the errors first before
making new errors. Then, you don't even need printk(). If
they are printing "good" stuff from the kernel, then the
kernel message facility is being abused.
