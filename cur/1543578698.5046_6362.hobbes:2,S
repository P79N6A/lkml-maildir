IDE is not my favourite example of a "known stable driver". Also, in many
cases IDE is for historical reasons connected to an EDGE io-apic pin (ie
it's still considered an ISA interrupt). Which probably wouldn't show this
problem anyway.
Also, IDE doesn't generate all that many interrupts. You can make a
network driver do a _lot_ more interrupts than just about any disk driver
by simply sending/receiving a lot of packets. With disks it is very hard
to get the same kind of irq load - Linux will merge the requests and do at
least 1kB worth of transfer per interrupt etc. On a ne2k 100Mbps PCI card,
you can probably _easily_ generate a much higher stream of interrupts.
