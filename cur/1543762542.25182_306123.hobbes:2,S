If I am allowed a wild guess here... Isn't by any chance i2c-1 one the
the 3 i2c adapters exported by the nvidiafb driver, which we know isn't
playing nicely with the i2c core? To me, it is simply a different
expression of the same bug Miles hit some days ago when loading the
i2c-dev or eeprom modules [1].
Miles, do you have the same problem with i2c-0 and i2c-2, or only i2c-1?
Can you please confirm that with CONFIG_FB_NVIDIA_I2C unset, the oops
vanishes?
