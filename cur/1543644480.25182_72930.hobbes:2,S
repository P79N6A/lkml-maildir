Ext3 CVS, but I'll also make a clean, broken-down patchset for
2.4.19 bk. 
In fact, the only reason it's not in ext3 cvs already is because it's
such a pain keeping discrete broken-down patches separate using a form
of SCM like bk or cvs; having decent scripts to track multiple patches
in a working source tree just works a lot better for one developer
when it comes to merging stuff upstream.
Cheers,
 Stephen
