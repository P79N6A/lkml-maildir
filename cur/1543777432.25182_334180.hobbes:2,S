Yes, no module currently uses it, but now that "pci_driver" is
supported, any PCI bridge driver could potentially be made into a
module.  In theory, this could even include the PCI<->PCI bridge driver.
I also wanted to export this as a module so that it would be easier to
add new drivers for more unusual bridge hardware.  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()
would be fine.
Thanks,
Adam
