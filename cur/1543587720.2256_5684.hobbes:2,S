isn't this a solution in search of a problem?
does it make sense to redesign parts of the kernel for the sole
purpose of making a completely unrealistic benchmark run faster?
(the chat "benchmark" is a simple pingpong load-generator; it is
not in the same category as, say, specweb, since it does not do *any*
realistic (nonlocal) IO.  the numbers "chat" returns are interesting,
but not indicative of any problem; perhaps even less than lmbench
components.)
