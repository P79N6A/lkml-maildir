Hello all,
	I have had this problem with both 2.3.18 and 2.3.19.  My computer has two IDE drives, a CD-ROM and
an ATAPI Zip drive at hdd.  When the boot gets to the "Partition check:" it goes through hda, hdb,
skips hdc (the CD-ROM) and then tries to do hdd.  On my 2.2 kernels, it gets a lost interrupt, and
continues loading.  On the 2.3 kernel, it gets the "lost interrupt" and then OOPS with an "Unable to
derefernce kernel NULL pointer."  If I have a zip disk in the drive, the load continues without the
"lost interrupt" and boots just fine.
	I haven't written down the OOPS, but if anyone wants (you can email me directly), I will boot into
2.3 again and write it down and forward it to the list.
	Good luck.
-Jeremy
