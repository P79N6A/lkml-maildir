FWIW, some of the old cobalt boxes had the old south bridge revision
with a WDT.  It managed to do resets/wdt off gpio pin 5 though, and
there is a patch in Alan's 2.6.10-ac tree that handles it.
Whether or not it will work with your vaio?  Probably not, though I
guess it wouldn't hurt to try (modprobe alim7101_wdt use_gpio=1).
