Afternnon all,
I have installed the 2.2.0-pre9 kernel on a AMD K6 PR166MMX system.
Compiled with 586 as the CPU and with PPP built in istead of a module,
using a 3c509-TP eth0 card piping to a Windows 98 machine using a
KNE-20T eth0 card running WinRoute Pro 3.0 and acting as the gateway
for the linux machine to the net. (NO comments about making linux the
gateway cause it's better ect.ect. , not an option in this situation.)
The problem is this. I am getting tcp line stalls where, for example,
I try to irc out of the linux box to say irc.chat.org. Worked just
fine with no problems before switching from 2.0.36-3 (RH 5.2 kernel
version) to 2.2.0-pre9.
One message being returned is Connection reset due to invalid system
call. NOthing else has changed inthe set up of the box, nor the irc
client or any other aspects of the box actually. Now, like every 2 or
3 connections I get this error, and the remainder of the time it is S
L O W in actually setting up and connecting for anythign from HTTP to
mail to FTP to irc. I have checked the pppd version and am up to date
as required for the 2.2.0 kernel. 
Another problem is that now for some reason every 5 or 6 reboots, my
eth0 goes into promiscuous mode. Once again the card is a 3Com
3c509-TP ISA 10/Mbt card.
It finds the card right but when the system tries to set it up I start
to get SIO_* errors. the gist of which, the card fails to be set up at
all and I am forced to reboot if I want to use the card. Actualyl I
have to totally power off and back on. No, the card is not in PnP
mode. The driver for the card is a module.
These errors never occured before and did not appear until I went to
2.2.0-pre9. Leads me to believe it's something with the kernel source.
Anyone have any clues or need more info, feel free to email me.
Flamers, I am already one step ahead of ya, this IS a kernel related
question specifically a development one. So save yer breath.
Thank you. :-))
