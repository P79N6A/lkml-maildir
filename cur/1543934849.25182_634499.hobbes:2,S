What David's patch does in fs/binfmt_elf.c is to make code conditional - 
exactly the code Andi removes as scheduled in 2.6.25. You should be able 
to simply drop the fs/binfmt_elf.c parts from
aout-suppress-aout-library-support-if-config_arch_supports_aout.patch.

BTW: There are also patch conflicts with git-x86, but since they are not 
     from David you have yet to ask us to look at them.  ;-)
