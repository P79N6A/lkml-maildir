I have the following setup on my PIV computer, shuttle motherboard,
2.6.0-test9 kernel:
eth1 is a RTL-8029 and connects me to the outside world
eth0 is a RT8139 and is where I plug my laptop.
Using ipchains, I masqerade the laptop, so that it can also access the
outside world.
The problem is that my computer locks up when I try to do a big backup
with rsync over ssh from the laptop to a computer in the outside world.
No mouse, no keyboard, nothing in the logs.
I couldn't reproduce it with some scp from the laptop to a computer over
the outside world. I don't know what is so special with rsync.
I couldn't reproduce it with a rsync from the laptop to my computer. That
is why I think it is ipchains related.
Everything is working fine with kernels -test1 and -test4. The lockup is
already present in -test8 and, I think, -test7 (need to check that).
Once I constated the problem with a complete boot (X11, kde, many
services), I have reproduced them in booting in single user mode, with no
more operations than ifup'ing eth0, eth1, loading ipchains and setting
the one single rule (masqerading) I need.
ONCE, I got some kernel trace spit out on the console before the computer
locked. Unfortunately, I only got the 24 last lines. I tried to obtain
another trace in a 80x60 vga mode, but failed. Here is the trace, hand
