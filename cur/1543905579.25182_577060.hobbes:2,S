Hmm. What is "this"? The revert? 
That said, I do wonder whether virtualization still has problems with 
CONFIG_RODATA, though. We limit the RODATA memory ranges based on KPROBES 
and HOTPLUG_CPU, but not based on VIRTUALIZATION.
I'd expect any virtualization fixups to hit the same problems that the SMP 
alternatives hit. No?
