Con, thank you for your time and results.
I have to confirm you that large file writes with a swappy kernel 
seems to waste time swapping data, I see it with the resp tool too.
May be we can say that a good value for a desktop enviroment is in the
40-50 range while for a server is 70-80, this because with the osdb bench
tool I get the best results with 80.
Ciao,
        Paolo
