Ok, since no one screamed too badly about this one, and it does fix this
issue, I'm sending it out for reals.
I think Bob's patch which addresses duplicate clocksources should go in,
but this one is a little more forceful in keeping the wrong hpet
clocksource from possibly being selected. 
Andrew, would you mind picking this up?
thanks

The ia64 hpet clocksource was implemented in generic code, and is not
yet ready to replace the i386 and x86_64 implementations. This results
in multiple hpet clocksources being registered, and if the ia64 one is
chosen on x86_64 some users have experienced hangs.
This patch only allows the generic implementation to be used on ia64,
until the duplicate i386 and x86_64 versions can be merged in and
tested.
