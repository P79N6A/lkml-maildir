I have two issues with this argument (not that I'm trying to say it
couldn't make a difference in your case).
Firstly, swap prefetch actually doesn't handle the midnight updatedb pageout
problem nicely. It doesn't do any prefetching when the pagecache/vfs cache
fills memory (which is what would have to happen for updatedb to push stuff
into swap).
Secondly, with or without swap prefetch, I think we can do a better job of
handling these use-once patterns to begin with.
