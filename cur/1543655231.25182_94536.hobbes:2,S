Yes, we've discussed that too...but not come to a conclusion.  The problem is 
really that if you call dma_alloc and pass in the DMA_CONFORMANCE_NON_CONSISTEN
T flag, what you're saying is "This driver implements all the correct cache 
flushes and can cope with inconsistent memory.  Please give me the type of 
memory that's most efficient for the platform I'm running on.".  The driver 
isn't asking give me a specific type of memory, it's telling the platform what 
it's capabilities are.
Any thoughts on naming would be most welcome.
