May I propose to keep this change in -mm?
This issue has already been discussed on the linux-pm list and the people
there seem to agree thet the way to go is to convert all PCI drivers to the
model in which they drop their IRQs on suspend and request them back on
resume (ref. 
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2005-May/000955.html
).
There are some drivers that already do it (eg the USB drivers), but there are
many drivers that don't and in fact the recent problems have been related to
them.  If the change stays in -mm we will be able to convert the drivers
gradually and they will hopefully get some testing.  When it's done, it
will be safe to push the change along with the converted drivers to
mainline.
Greets,
Rafael
