I agree, having them is far better then the standard u+g+w that's been 
around for ages.  I think it gives the "finer" grain of control over your 
system that a lot of users may desire.  Not to mention the fact that ACL's 
are well supported by the recently merged XFS.  If I'm not mistaken, AFS 
uses them as well.  I *really* don't see the overhead cost here in terms of 
compiled kernel size when they are turned off.  As for the size of the 
source tarball, who cares?  People should quit whining about the size of 
the sources and get over it!  Storage is cheap and broadband is in 
widespread use.
Cheers,
Nicholas
