This can't fix the glibc emulation problem.  As the kernel
this patch would apply to doesn't need emulation.
The basic goal of allowing the current process to access it's
own proc directories is reasonable.
I don't like the implementation. It is not obvious that this case
applies just to the current process.
I admit that any permission checking in /proc that happens at
open time instead of at access time is buggy but that is
the best we have right now.
Anything more requires a very close review.
