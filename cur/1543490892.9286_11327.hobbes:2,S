Hi Allen.
These messages seem to be coincident with my logging in from my laptop,
then starting a remote X session.  My home directory is mounted over NFS
in such a situation.  Now that I think of it, ~/.Xauthority is always
being griped about in the logs.  I assume it's being re-written or renamed
underneath one or more processes which are holding it open?
Here's the log clientside:

Hope this sheds some light on things.
