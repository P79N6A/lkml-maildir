That's the conclusion I came to. I've rewritten the patch to use port.type
instead of iotype since one of the fix is SoC and not UART specific. I guess
I could use both iotype and type with a test on each for the appropriate
bug, what do you recommend?

Unfortunately it's not a constant offset from the UART in the SoC register
space. I've used Alan suggestion and added a classic, on some other OSes %-|,
void "user" pointer.
I'll repost as soon I complete testing and try the new timer patch.
