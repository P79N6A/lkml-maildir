   ok, maybe it sounded to harsh. What I really meant was that when I
   was doing my research on the atheros chipset I revealed some
   differences between what is actually in HAL and what is in openbsd
   driver. It could have been due to the update schedule of madwifi. It
   is always easier to be up to date with the vendor supported driver
   than with reverse engineered one. Anyways what I saw was that some
   parts were missing in openbsd. I don't know how much in overall.
