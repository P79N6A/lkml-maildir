How about bfd is a bloated monstrosity.  Right now libobj is
just over 10k; you'll be looking at a _minimum_ of 150k to
pull in only the linking code from libbfd.a.
How about bfd is an unmaintainable nightmare?  If you've not
spent the last couple of years working on bfd, save your
sanity and don't start.
It would take only a day or three to fix up libobj to cross
compile.  If you don't want to do it, let someone else.
