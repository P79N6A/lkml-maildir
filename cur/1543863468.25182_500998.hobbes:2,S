Earlier I was going through the stable paches which apply for these
kernel version:
http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_19
http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_18
http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16
I have to dig deep into the patch & kernel version to understand what
are the features/implementations or fixes (patch).  Problem here is 2
ways:-
1) Identifying which is a better kernel (features) for
Desktop/Embedded/Server (I know, info mentioned in Changelog. But
still...)
2) Easily knowing which stable patch applies for which arch or sub
system (better way)
Proposal: Can maintainers implement this for better understanding of
the Linux community (picking the best kernel or patch for the
requirement) by adding a column on www.kernel.org home page?
Examples:
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:  	2.6.19.2
*networking subsystem*	2007-01-10 19:11 UTC 	F 	V 	VI 	C 	Changelog
The latest prepatch for the stable Linux kernel tree is:  	2.6.20-rc5
*x86 32/64*	2007-01-12 19:29 UTC 	B 	V 	VI 	C 	Changelog
