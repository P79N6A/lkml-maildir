Also, with copy-on-write and mremap after fork, doing an
object based rmap scheme for anonymous pages is just complex,
almost certainly far too complex to be worth it, since it just
has too many issues.  Just read the patches by bcrl and davem,
things get hairy fast.
The pte chain rmap scheme is clean, but suffers from too much
overhead for file mappings.
As shown by Dave's patch, a hybrid system really is simple and
clean, and it removes most of the pte chain overhead while still
keeping the code nice and efficient.
I think this hybrid system is the way to go, possibly with a few
more tweaks left and right...
regards,
Rik
