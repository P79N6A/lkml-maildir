I'd agrue the exact opposite.  If you're starting from scratch (new
patchset, etc, where you might do something like mv mm/slab.c.old
mm/slab.c) use 'distclean' or 'mrproper'.  If you just want to do a
'make clean' because you can't be sure you trust the build system to get
things right, you don't want the version being reset.
