Yes. That is one of the main problems I have when trying to get some exotic
module loaded. For most of the time, I know the parameters by now - but
sometimes (e.g. NCR400a SCSI, which I never got to run properly) I had to
wade through the source - a real PITback.
I'd volunteer to help create (and maintain) a place (text file, most
probably) where developers put their README files for modules _including_
detailed parameter description and so on in a standard format (probably
something like the CREDITS file).
If there is any reason why we should be doing something else instead,
please let me know - I'd surely like to hear your better ideas.
But I think the current situation (README's scattered through the source
tree) is inacceptable for many people. Having to actually compile your own
kernel is a seldom task with todays' distros, so browsing the source itself
does not even occur to many people when looking for driver information.
