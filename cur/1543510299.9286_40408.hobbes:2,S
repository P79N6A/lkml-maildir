Subject: Can't play audio CDs in 2.3.1x (NOT the check_media_type thing)

With check_media_type=1, and cdplay opening in blocking mode, the open
fails with incorect media type, as expected.
If check_media_type=0, or cdplay opens in non-blocking mode (or both),
cdplay fails with the message CDROMPLAYMSF: Success.  cdp, under the same
circumstances, fails with CDROMPLAYMSF: No such file or directory.
Both the errors seem rather confusing.
Any ideas?
