Hi,

There is a format called CD Extra aka CD Plus aka Enhanced CD,
where the audio tracks are in the first session and additional
multimedia bits are placed in the second session.
This format is mountable under Linux (showing the data portion, of course)...

Yep, only the first session is readable in HiFi cd players.
