Sorry. I don't have any free machine to do this kind of tests. :(

It looks like between .20 and .23, included.
Test was done by Randy Hron <rwhron@earthlink.net> over a OSDL server:
4x700 mhz Pentium III Xeons with 1MB cache 3.75 GB RAM
DAC960 Fiber channel to SCSI disks in RAID5 configuration
more details at 
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/bigbox.html
what is very strange is that in two different tests and kernels
(2.4.23-pre4 and2.4.23-rc1) 'Maximum Latency' is very high with
256 threads.
