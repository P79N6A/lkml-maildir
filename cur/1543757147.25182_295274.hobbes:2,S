No, such a flag wouldn't make sense as it's not really a ROM shadow. In
fact, the driver is just part of the main open firmware, there are no
tables we can get to like x86 etc... however, we can access properties
in the open firmware device-tree that have been set by the OF driver. So
it's a completely different mecanism. A ROM shadow bit wouldn't make
sense.
