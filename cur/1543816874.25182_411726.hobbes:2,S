Simply the initial lock chain is L1->L2->L3->L4, which is no deadlock.
Now in the course of your lock dropping L2 gets removed while you are at
L3 and L5 gets added on top of L4. You follow the chain blindly and
detect a dealock vs. L5, but its not longer valid. The L2 cleanup is
blocked by yourself. There is no way to prevent this with your method.
Your method is tempting, but I do not see how it works out right now.
