Works fine.  However now that Redhat Rawhide contains gcc version 4.1.0 20051207 
(Red Hat 4.1.0-0.6) I'm seeing quite a few compile warnings, one in particular 
appearing in hundreds of lines:
In file included from include/asm/mpspec.h:5,
                  from include/asm/smp.h:18,
                  from include/linux/smp.h:22,
                  from include/linux/sched.h:26,
                  from include/linux/module.h:10,
                  from drivers/net/sky2.c:39:
include/asm/mpspec_def.h:78: warning: 'packed' attribute ignored for field of 
type 'unsigned char[5u]'
There is a patch in the Fedora Core Kernel RPM that 'fixes' this for the FC kernels:
http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/devel/kernel/linux-2.6-gcc41.patch
http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/devel/kernel/linux-2.6-gcc41.patch?rev=1.3&view=markup
Perhaps part or all of it could go into -mm for further testing?  Is this a gcc 
glitch or something that ought to be fixed in the kernel?  (davej?)
