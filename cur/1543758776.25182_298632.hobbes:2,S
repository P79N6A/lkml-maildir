The winchips had a funky feature where you could mark system ram
writes as out-of-order. This led to something like a 25% speedup iirc
on benchmarks that did lots of memory copying. lmbench showed
significant wins iirc, but any results I had saved are long since
wiped out in hard disk failures/cruft removal over the years.

Looks ok on a quick eyeball.
