I think its perfectly doable to set the maximum retries per
device. Have a look at the current ide_error() and the error: handler
in the relevant ide drivers (notably ide-cd).

A lot of the time you have to go through the controller reset. However 
cutting the retries down and having good readahead management on the
I/O thread ought to still cope with that.
As to drives I'm using a mix of drives. Old 1x and 2x speed DVD drives
are very cheap so its a good way to get multiple regions cheaply, and
saves breaking the DMCA in the US 8)
