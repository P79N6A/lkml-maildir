"Foolish enough"? Multiple users told you that they consider that use

If it is okay during runtime, it should be okay while suspended. Don't
expect users to know about power on USB buses. You may call any system
that does not support standby power on USB broken if you wish...

"Does not such any worse than non-usb" does not cut it here. USB disks
are too easy to unplug/replug.
Anyway, your mail came without a patch, again. That's useless; if you
implement layer above floppies/usb sticks that can recognize same
disk, maybe we can talk about that.
