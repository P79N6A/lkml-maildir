This message prompted me to do some checking in re context switches myself, 
and I've come to the conclusion that there could be a bug in vmstat itself.
Run singly the context switching is reasonable even for a -19 niceness of x, 
its only showing about 200 or so on the first loop of vmstat.  But throw in 
the -n 1 arguments and it goes crazy on the second and subsequent loops.

Now, I have NDI which set of figures is the true set, but please note that in 
all 3 cases the reported values for cs didn't scale up and down all that much 
if separated out into 1st pass, and subsequent passes.
And, even with X nice=10, the system is still fairly smooth and usable.
This is with 2.6.21-rc7-CFS-v5 I built late last evening.  At Xnice=10 I just 
played a game of patience to watch the card animations and they were 
absolutely acceptably smooth. (and I won it in about 112 moves :)
From this users viewpoint, it (cfs-v5) works, and works very well indeed, and 
it deserves a place as one of 3 selectable options in mainline.  The other 2 
being the existing mainline way, & Con K's sd-0.45 or later.  Both of these 
seem to be very large enhancements to the user experience over current 
mainline, which I'd discuss in terms borrowed from Joanne Dow.  Comparatively 
speaking, mainline has a very high vacuum.
