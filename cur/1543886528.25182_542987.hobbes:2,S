Any progress on that?  I looked again, and yes most commands
are identical.
 - That driver relies on an AT91-only SPI stack that's not
   going upstream, instead of drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c;
 - Driver can't even be selected on kernel.org kernel (!!);
 - The m25p80 driver will need at most minor tweaks to
   handle those AT26 (and AT25) series chips;
So 340ea370c2ce89d1c15fbf785460f2f74314ce58 should be reverted.
