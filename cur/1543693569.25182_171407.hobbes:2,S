I'm trying to build a driver external to the kernel. I'm running 2.6.0-test6
kernel.
It appears to me (I'm probably wrong) that there is a kernel include file issue.
gcc -c rtom.c -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -DDEBUG -DDEBUG_LEVEL=6
-I/lib/modules/2.6.0-test6/build/include -I../include/linux/sys
-I../include/linux -I../include -O -o rtom

./include/asm-i386/mach-numaq/mach_mpspec.h
./include/asm-i386/mach-bigsmp/mach_mpspec.h
In the 'include/asm/mpspec.h' file:
#ifndef __ASM_MPSPEC_H
#define __ASM_MPSPEC_H
#include <linux/cpumask.h>
#include <asm/mpspec_def.h>    
#include <mach_mpspec.h>   <-----------------------------------------------
extern int mp_bus_id_to_type [MAX_MP_BUSSES];
It seems like something is amiss here. Isn't the include statment incorrect
above?
Thanks
Mark
