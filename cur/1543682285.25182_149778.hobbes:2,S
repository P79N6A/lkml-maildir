You do this in two steps: first construct an sgml document, then invoke
docbook2man.
So, first you have to figure out what the proper docbook markup is
for such material. According to me it is <docinfo>...</docinfo>,
to be placed inside <refentry> before <refmeta>.
So you do that - example script fragments appended below.
Next, the docbook2man stage. My presently installed docbook2man says
# IGNORE.
sgml('<DOCINFO>', sub { push_output('nul'); });
sgml('</DOCINFO>', sub { pop_output(); });
That is, it does not produce any output for a docinfo section.
I consider that a bug in docbook2man - it should output nroff comments.
Probably this bug will be fixed sooner or later.
(I'll cc Steve Cheng who is listed as maintainer.)
In the meantime I do not worry too much about this missing copyright.
By the way, you start copying at <legalnotice>, but I consider that
the least interesting part. The fact that these docs were written
by Alan Cox is much more interesting. In other words, it might be
a good idea to enlarge this <docinfo> section a bit.

In split-man:
  elsif($mode == 2){
    if(/<refmeta>/){
      $refdata = "$refdata\n<docinfo>\n$front\n$blurb\n</docinfo>\n"
    }
    $refdata = "$refdata$_";
  }
Here $front is the original one - do not delete <legalnotice>.
And $blurb is your text:
  <authorblurb><para>
    If you have comments on the formatting of this manpage, then please contact
    Michael Still (mikal\@stillhq.com).
  </para></authorblurb>
