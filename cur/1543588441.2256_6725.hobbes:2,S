Subject: 2.4.3-ac10/ac11 crash at boot in PDC20265 check

It looks like the check for the PDC20265 added in ac10 causes some
problems. I have an MSI K7T Turbo R which has a Promise FastTrak built in -
when I try to boot ac10 or ac11 on it I get an Oops just after the "ide:
Found promise 20265 in RAID mode." message. I diffed ide-pci.c between ac5
(which worked) and ac10 (which fails) and found that the only change was
the check for the PDC20265 - I commented this out and the kernel boots fine
now.
On another topic, does anyone know how to disable the onboard FastTrak? I
don't use it, and it makes my boot time longer...
Thanks,
