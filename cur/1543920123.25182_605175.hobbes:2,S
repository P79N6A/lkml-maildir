I think it happened for reads too.  It is a little counter intuitive
because in theory the CPU doesn't need to write back non dirty lines,
but in the one case which took so long to debug exactly this happened
somehow.
At it is undefined for reads and writes in the architecture so 
better be safe than sorry.
And x86 CPUs are out of order and do speculative executation
and that can lead to arbitary memory accesses even if the code
never touches an particular address.
Newer Intel CPUs have something called self-snoop which was supposed
to handle this; but in some situations it doesn't seem to catch it
either.

AGP doesn't allocate highmem pages.  Not sure about the DRM code.
