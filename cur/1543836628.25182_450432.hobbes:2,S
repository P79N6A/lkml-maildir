So when we write to sysfs to set the governor, we end up in store_scaling_governor()
which takes the hotplug lock, and then calls off into the governor to let it
do its thing. Part of ondemand's "thing" is to create a workqueue.
unfortunatly, __create_workqueue also takes the hotplug lock.
Creating a variant of __create_workqueue that doesn't take the lock
seems really nasty.
We could remove the locking from store_scaling_governor() and make the governors
themselves have to do the locking, but I'm not sure that's entirely safe.
We could do something really disgusting like ...
	unlock_cpu_hotplug()
	...
	create_workqueue()
	...
	lock_cpu_hotplug()
in ondemand, which opens up a tiny race window, but as ugly as it is,
looks to be the best solution of the bunch right now.
Comments?
The really sad part is this is completely unrelated to the original bug reported
in this thread, which shows just how widespread this braindamage is.
Michal's traces really don't really scream anything obvious to me.
(Though given it took me 4 hours to decode my own traces above, this is no
real sign of how big a problem this might be).
Michal, could you apply this diff.. 
http://lkml.org/lkml/diff/2006/8/4/381/1
(change the '120' to '60' first), and send me the debug spew that you get ?
You'll have to wait until a minute of uptime has passed. Oh, and edit
include/linux/jiffies.h to change INITIAL_JIFFIES to '0'.
