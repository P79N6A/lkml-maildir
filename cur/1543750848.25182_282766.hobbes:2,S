Yup.  There's a lot of cruft in that driver.  I really don't like the
look of fd_mcs_intr() -- trying to deduce whether or not there's a data phase
out based on the command byte?  urgh.
There's a somehat better-maintained driver -- fdomain.c.  It'd be great
if someone could make fdomain.c support the MCA cards -- and even the PCMCIA
cards without having the separate fdomain_stub.c.  I'd be happy to make
suggestions to anyone who has an fdomain card and wants to take on the
responsibility of maintaining the driver.
If anyone's really keen, there's an ISA card on eBay for $2 ...

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
