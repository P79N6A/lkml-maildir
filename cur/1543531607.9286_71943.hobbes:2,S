If I promise to say one thing in a civilised way and then shut up, is
that OK? :-) I don't want to see nanae flamewars here any more than anyone
else does..
My two problems with ORBS are (i) the multi-level relay listing, and (ii) the
relay testing. The latter is irrelevant to your use of it, so let's skip that.
(i) may be a problem, though -- for example, Demon's mail servers do end up in
ORBS every now then, and I think most people would admit that they're not
normally technically clueless. I imagine some of their users might have useful
mail for you (bug reports, etc.).. Would the benefits of using something like
the MAPS RSS (which doesn't list multi-level relays) perhaps outweigh the costs
(some relays not being spotted)?
