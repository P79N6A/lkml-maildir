I thought everything got addressed, apart from
 - please split all the generic stackable filesystem passthorugh routines
   into a separated stackfs layer, in a few files in fs/stackfs/ that
   you depend on.  They'll get _GPL exported to all possible stackable
   filesystem.  They'll need their own store underlying object helpers,
   but that can be made to work by embedding the generic stackfs data
   as first thing in the ecryptfs object.
which seemed rather a lot to ask.
