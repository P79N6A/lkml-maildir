I actually neither needs to, nor does. For ptrace the definition is:
    If the tracee has different privilegies, than the tracer, than it
    can't be traced.
For this definition, the check is not a hack. It's the only way to go.
Now this definition is really what is needed for the filesystem case
too, so I think it's not a hack either.
