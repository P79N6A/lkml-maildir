I use this tool: 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/laptop_mode/tools/
that automagically fires up whenever needed
$ cat /etc/laptop-mode/batt-start/brightness 
#!/bin/sh
echo -n CHOOSE_A_LOW_VALUE > /sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness
and
$ cat /etc/laptop-mode/batt-stop/brightness 
#!/bin/sh
let val="`</proc/acpi/sony/brightness_default` - 1"
echo -n "$val" > /sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness
But I seldom use my laptop in battery mode.

I think the new gnome-power-manager does it, but I'm not sure since I use Xfce.
