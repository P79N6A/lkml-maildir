Ok. I found the first unrelated problem:
both pipe_read and pipe_write use
	PIPE_WAITING_{READERS,WRITERS}(*inode)--;
without any locking. This is not SMP safe, but you wrote that it also
happens on UP.
if PIPE_WAITING_WRITERS gets stuck at one, then pipe_read(,32k) will not
return until 32k bytes are  written.
I'll try to concentrate on an UP problem, but so far without success.
