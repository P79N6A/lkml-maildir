Most Linux filesystems can't be used properly with flash devices because
of unability to handle write errors caused by flash wearing out. FS
should mark the block as bad and relocate the data. Some devices report
"read correctly, but had ECC" and when such happens data should also be
relocated to not worn-out place and block marked as bad.
