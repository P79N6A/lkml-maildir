Oops.. I forgot to add the To: header (it was only sent to lkml).

Sure thing, the change will be needed.  But the thing is - with the
cast in place, compiler will be completely silent, while w/o the cast
it will produce a warning (or at least it's able to).
Generally, casts are bad, that's the point.  Especially redundrand
ones like here.
As a side note, I dislike when people remove casts from functions
returning void*.  For example,
  struct somestruct *foo;
  foo = (struct somestruct *)kmalloc(sizeof(struct somestruct));
With the cast in place, the compiler will warn if somestruct will
be changed to something else, but without the cast, the compiler
will happily accept the (now wrong) line.

Yes, that's what i was referring to when said "let the compiler
do some work for us".
