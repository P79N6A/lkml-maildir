Sorry for not responding sooner.  The mail got lost and I only just noticed it.

You had suggested
	while (card not ready)
		status |= send_status();

Multiblock writes are terminated with a stop command when an error occurs,
and there is a loop waiting on the status whether an error occurs or not.
