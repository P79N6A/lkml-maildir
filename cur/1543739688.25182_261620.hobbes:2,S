Can not disagree here, except that %ecx is the only parameter.
eax/edx are just saved in the stack, and then restored (see comments
before the assembly in semaphore.c).

This is an assumption. AFAIK, according to C standard, formal parameters
are
COPIED from actual parameters. Formal parameters can not be used outside
the function, and as far as they are not constant ones, C compiler
is free to mofidy them after their last use, and use the memory for
other purposes.

Well, build the kernel with DEBUG_KERNEL disabled with gcc 3.2 for
instance,
objdump it and check __up() code. You'll be surprised. And this is NOT
gcc issue.

Sorry, there was a typo as specified above. Of cause, you still need
push/pop eax & edx, that was ommited for brevity, cause it is not really
relevant.

I meant as indicated above.
