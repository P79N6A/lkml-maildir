Sorry I meet another problem. After the system was completely setupped,
the gdb interface will be covered with that system interaction interface.
So, I can't stop the system's running and add some new break point etc.
But I can do those operations in remote kgdb debugging.
Any method to fix this problem?
Thanks.
