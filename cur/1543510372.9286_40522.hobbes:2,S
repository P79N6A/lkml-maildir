Let's be really malicious. Since open files don't go away
when their unlinked, I can prevent someone from getting access
to their disk quotas by opening their files before they unlink them,
thus preventing the blocks from being freed. No matter that they
tried to prevent me from doing this by setting permission bits.
No, a file with mode 000 (---------- for you young'uns) ought not
be openable by unprivileged users, period.
