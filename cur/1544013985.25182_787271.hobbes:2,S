    net: Fix for initial link state in 2.6.28
It causes us to now call the linkwatch even trigger code inside of
software interrupt context, but that is illegal because that code path
takes the dev_base_lock rwlock as a writer.
I'm going to revert, and Michael will need to find a way to fix the
initial link state issue without adding locking problems :-)
