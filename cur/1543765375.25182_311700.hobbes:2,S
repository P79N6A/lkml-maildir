Subject: weird X problem - priority inversion?

I am having a problem with the RT preempt kernels where xscreensaver
will cause the X server to consume excessive CPU, starving other
processes.  This should not happen as xscreensaver runs at the highest
nice value.  It seems that there's some kind of priority inversion
happening between the high prio X server and low prio xscreensaver.
This seems like an X problem to me, but could the kernel be involved?
