Not sure what to say to that ... the API is practical, flags
seem to make sense for that call (the flags give the slightly
different "set" semantics, but it is still "set"), IMO they
don't make sense for others.

No.  Many existing versions of Unix support extended attributes
in some form or another, but there is no common API/standard -
each implementation differs, sometimes radically, to the others.

Please read the archives first - discussion started well over a
year ago now on an API for Linux, and there have been heaps and
heaps of ideas, proposals, prototypes, etc, floated.
The lack of progress on getting something in the kernel is
hurting several projects (even having syscalls reserved would
be a _huge_ help to us).  We have distributors telling us they
would include XFS in their kernels if there was some progress
on this particular issue.

Mmm.. I seriously doubt there could ever be any standards in this
area - I would be satisfied with a good implementation on Linux,
which allows filesystems from different operating systems to use
it while preserving any existing on-disk formats they may have.

Start with the mail we sent to Linus, LKML, fs-devel, etc about a
month ago - it had pointers to the original discussion from this
time last year (and in that discussion, Andreas provided pointers
to documentation for several other implementations, incl. BSD,
IRIX, Tru64, & others).  It also has pointers to several projects
relying on the existing, diverging Linux implementations.
It should probably be pointed out again that many of the folk
working on filesystems which support extended attributes have
given their collective thumbs up to the latest round of patches.
In particular, the projects which have already implemented EAs
(XFS, ext2/ext3) and services above EAs, are confident that
these patches will work for them and that we'll be able to get
our userspace code working together for the first time.
cheers.
