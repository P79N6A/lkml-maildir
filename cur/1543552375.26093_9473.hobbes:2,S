Maybe the A20 stuff that was added in test9.
In 2.2 we do this..
        in      al,#0x92        ! read "System Control Port A" 
        or      al,#0x02        ! Set "Alternate Gate A20" - Bit
        out     #0x92,al        ! write "System Control Port A"
and in 2.4 this...
        movb    $02, %al            # "fast A20" version 
        outb    %al, $0x92          # some chips have only this
So now we clobber all the bits instead of just the one bit that
we need to change.  Try changing this code to use the 2.2 method.
regards,
davej.
