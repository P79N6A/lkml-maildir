    Yes, I know the difference, I'm afraid I didn't ask my question
correctly O:). What I meant is that, since I don't know if my CPU has
latency problems when switching from "slow" freq to "fast" freq, if I
can use "ondemand" safely or if I must use "conservative" due to latency
problems with my CPU.
    Thanks for your answer :)
