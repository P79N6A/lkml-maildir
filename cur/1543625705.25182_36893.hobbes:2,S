I don't think the patch should be that generic; we're into dragon
territory here already.  We should follow VIA's fix by default
(clear bits 5, 6, 7), and clear bit 7 only if a VT8365 is
detected.
Even then, I personally want to do some checking to see that the
VT8365 is the real culprit, before firing off a patch which could
affect all other VIA users.  I don't want hate mail coming into
my inbox 8).
