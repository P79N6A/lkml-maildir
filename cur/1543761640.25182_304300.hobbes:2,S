I think you mean login shells, the login process is just the thing asking
for the password agter the (m)ingetty got the username. These processes
are usurally created with the '-' sign in argv[0][0], but the users may
replace that string at will. I think it's still OK to depend on that if
you want a semi-secure system.

This feature seems to be frequently requested. I don't remember the 
outcome, though.
From a quick view, it seems the symlinks in /proc are empty for kernel 
threads and non-empty for user processes. Since you're messing with the 
proc entries, this could be a cheap way to find the kernel threads.
Another possibility is by looking at the blocked signals, signal 9 may not 
be blocked by mortals.
For the system daemons, you could additionally check for the absence of a 
controlling tty, but that's still no safe distinction from a process run 
by nohup. Checking for sid=pid will filter additional processes, but it 
the shell in midnight commander and screen are still false positives.
Checking for */sbin*/ in $PID/command will fail as soon as the daemon 
overwrites argv[0].
I don't think there is a relaible way to tell the system service daemons
from screen except for the name, and you'll want to detect screen-alike
programs, too.
