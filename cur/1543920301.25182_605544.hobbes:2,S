I was just trying to use the strangeness in a large distributor's first 
attempt at this functionality as an evidence that it's apparently not trivial 
to get even the common cases right under the new model, while the common 
cases used to be trivial to get right under the old model.  (Or at least it 
seemed so to me.)
I think I've exhausted this line of argument, though, and will stop now.
