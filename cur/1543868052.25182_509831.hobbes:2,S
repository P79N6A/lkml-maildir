Well forcing load/store serialize on the CPU doesn't help, disalbing
memory bypass doesn't help.  Enabling the X86_OOSTORE does help.  What a
stupid CPU design.
So far nothing has managed to fix the __memcpy_toio in the jsm driver
getting data out of order when sending on an exar pci uart chip.  Only
calling memcpy with one byte at a time seems to work there.  Works fine
on every other cpu of course.  What else am I going to discover is wrong
with this CPU.
