The code looks fine to me from a first look, but the the name is just dumb.
Given that all your internal identifiers are trace_* or TRACE_ go all
the way and make it CONFIG_TRACE and lib/trace.c aswell.
Long term we probably want more complex tracing based on lttng, but I'm
a big fan of starting out simple and doing incremental changes.
So my 1c for merging this in 2.6.23 with the exports ripped out until
we actually grow modular users (which will probably come with the blktrace
markers conversion later on)

static inline struct trace_info *trace_setup(const char *root,

It's gstc.c now and should be trace.c, nevermind that filename doesn't
really belong here anyway :)

Using sched_clock is quite dangerous.  And just adding a wrapper to get
it exported is not nice either :)
