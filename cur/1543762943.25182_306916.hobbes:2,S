It seems to me that people wanting this level of assurance should do
their own FIPS (or whatever) tests.
Interrupts are not totally unpredictable, either, yet noone runs FIPS
tests on them. I'd say that hardware generator is still better than
interrupt timing. If someone really wants casino-level of randomness,
they should do it all in userspace, probably off interrupt entropy
sources, and do their own FIPS testing.

Well, you are still using hardware RNG, but failed one. I do not see
how you can break law with that... given that hardware RNG had proper
certification in the first place.
