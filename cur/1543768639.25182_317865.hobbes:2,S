ok, I will move assignment.

The reason is that reiser4 implements its own sync_inodes method of
struct super_operations. reiser4_sync_inodes first calls
generic_sync_sb_inodes and then calls reiser4' function to flush atoms
to disk. If generic_sync_sb_inodes would exit with inode_lock locked,
reiser4_sync_inodes would have to unlock inode_lock after
generic_sync_sb_inodes and lock it before exit. inode_lock is static for
fs/inode.c, so, we asked whether it would be possible to have
spinlocking in generic_sync_sb_inodes.
