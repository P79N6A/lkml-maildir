Peter, 
In these patches, we provide memory control that includes
mapped pages and unmapped pages (as discussed in the BOF). All memory
is treated uniformly. We will not have separate page cache control,
what we can have is control for either mapped pages or control
for a combination of mapped and unmapped pages together.
