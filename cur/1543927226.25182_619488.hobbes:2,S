Well maybe in the future.
One of the issues that I ran into is that I had to place the cpu area
in between to make the offsets link right.
However, it would be best if the cpuarea came *after* the modules area. We 
only need linking that covers the per cpu area of processor 0.
So I think we have a 2GB area right?
1GB kernel
1GB - 1x per cpu area (128M?) modules?
cpu aree 0
---- 2GB limit
cpu area 1 
cpu area 2
....
For that we would need to move the kernel down a bit. Can we do that?
