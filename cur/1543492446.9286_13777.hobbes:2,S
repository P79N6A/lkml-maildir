Oops. Sorry, I've missed the beginning of that thread. BTW, there is a
*very* good reason to do so - we actually have a pretty evil race there.
Look: we are umounting the fs. Massive sync happens. Notice that buffers
remain on their corresponding lists. Normally they would be reshuffled by
sync_old_buffers (from bdflush). And here comes the race: suppose that
umount() and mount() happen before the bdflush wakeup. Furthermore,
suppose that ->put_super() calls set_blocksize() (eg. FAT or sysvfs). See
clean buffer on the dirty list. See it unhashed. See the same block reread
from disk after mount. See it dirtified. See bdflush waking up and moving
the old copy to the clean list. Using refile_buffer(). Which happens to
rehash the sucker. And place it before the new (modified) copy in the
hash chain. Have a nice nightmare ;-/
I've triggered that debugging the new FAT code ;-/ Well, to be accurate,
VFAT testsuite triggers that... 
Down, not across!
