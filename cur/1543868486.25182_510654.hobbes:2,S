There is no legal meaning to "combining" two works of authorship under
the Berne Convention or any national implementation thereof.  If you
"compile" or "collect" them, you're in one area of law, and if you
create a work that "adapts" or "recasts" (or more generally "derives
from") them, you're in another area of law.  A non-exclusive license
can authorize one of these categories of conduct and not the other, or
can slice and dice the scope of the license along almost any axis of
law or fact.  But what it can't do is use the phrase "derivative work"
passim -- a legal term of art invented by US judges and legislators to
corral a class of infringing works and treat them differently from
compilations -- and pretend that it also encompasses compilations
(copyrightable and otherwise; there is an originality threshold here
too) and use by reference.

If the amount of "adapting, translating, and recasting" done to the
pre-existing works crosses a minimum threshold of creative expression
(not "sweat of the brow", at least not under Feist), then you've
created a derivative work.  If the amount of "selecting and arranging"
done to create a compilation crosses a similar threshold of creative
expression, you've created a copyrightable compilation or collective
work.  If neither, then all you've done is copy and distribute.
That's how the law works.  IANAL, TINLA.

Perhaps pointless if you were the sole audience, since you seem
disinclined to evaluate the accuracy of your beliefs given novel
information backed by extensive citations to the primary literature.
Not pointless if it disabuses other people, with less deeply ingrained
errors of understanding, of the notion that they can trust certain
very heavily financially interested parties to tell them the truth
about what the law says.
