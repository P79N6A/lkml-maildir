           Summary: Volume not remembered.
    Kernel Version: 2.5.x
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: pat@suwalski.net
Distribution: Gentoo
Hardware Environment: ALSA, 82801AA AC'97 Audio
Software Environment: Gnome
Problem Description:
Not certain if this is kernel or ALSA specific. In 2.4.x OSS volume levels
were remembered for the various mixers. Now all of them always default to 0
at bootup. I never ran ALSA with the 2.4 series, but it would be nice to
remember volumes.
Should I be bugging the alsa-project people instead?
Steps to reproduce:
Set a volume level, reboot, level has been reset.
