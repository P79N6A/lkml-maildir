Your patch access the iocb after the __aio_put_req() call, that can make 
the iocb (and the reference to the ki_eventfd) to become invalid. It also 
has the spurious wakeup issue (not a biggie, but if it can be avoided).
There're two solutions AFAICS. The first solution/patch get a reference to 
the file*, and signal (if the event has really been dropped inside the 
ring) and release.
The second solution/patch simply moves the eventfd_signal() call before 
the __aio_put_req() call, but after the event has beed "ringed".
We should be clear to go with the shorter/nicer second solution. Those 
patches builds, but I'm not even signing them off till I tested them.
