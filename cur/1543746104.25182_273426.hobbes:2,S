There is no problem moving back to the atomic approach that is if it is
okay to also make anon_rss atomic. But its a pretty significant
performance hit (comparison with some old data from V4 of patch which
makes this data a bit suspect since the test environment is likely
slightly different. I should really test this again. Note that the old
performance test was only run 3 times instead of 10):

Lets go for the approach to move rss into the thread structure but
keep the rss in the mm structure as is (need to take page_table_lock
for update) to consolidate the values. This allows to keep most
of the code as is and the rss in the task struct is only used if
we are not holding page_table_lock.
Maybe we can then find some way to regularly update the rss in the mm
structure to avoid the loop over the tasklist in proc.
