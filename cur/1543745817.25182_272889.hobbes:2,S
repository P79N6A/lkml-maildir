Hmm... but other compares in sched.c are ok? ;-)
1211:   BUG_ON(p->state != TASK_RUNNING);
2550:   if (unlikely(current == rq->idle) && current->state != TASK_RUNNING) {
3609:   if (state == TASK_RUNNING)
3640:   if (state != TASK_RUNNING)
Well, it just looks more readable to me. But i don't have too strong
feelings about this. :-)
