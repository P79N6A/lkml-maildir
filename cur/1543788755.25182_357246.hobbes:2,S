Hi,
This patch is different from the previous one. This is for IPW2200. ;-)
It updates the information/README to match the Kconfig info of the IPW2200.
Please apply to have a better documented 2.6.14
I dunno if this is either handled by Netdev or LKML because is about
Documentation/
Thanks,
.Alejandro

+-----------------------------------------------
+
+As the firmware is licensed under a restricted use license, it can not be    
+included within the kernel sources.  To enable the IPW2200 you will need a    
+firmware image to load into the wireless NIC's processors.
+
+You can obtain these images from <
http://ipw2200.sf.net/firmware.php>.
+
+The firmware package should be extracted where your hotplug firmware agent      
+is looking:
+
+% grep FIRMWARE /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent
+
+The most common path is /lib/firmware but the firmware.agent will tell.
