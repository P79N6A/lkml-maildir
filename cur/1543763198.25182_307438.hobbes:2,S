I was just wondering if anyone has started working on a driver for the
marvell wifi chips.  I just bought a new Asus motherboard and it has
built in wifi.  I contacted Marvell and they claimed they could
provide databooks under NDA.  If no one else is working on it, I may
try my hand at it, although I must say I've never written a network
driver.  Is anyone else planning support/working on a driver/etc.?
Thanks,
Alex
