I get the feeling we are talking past each other.  From my point of
view, it is entirely too easy to forget to run update.  You then have
no safety net for disk operations.  Putting update into the kernel
guarantees you don't make this mistake.  The patch makes the kernel
_smaller_, frees a task slot, and is a wash performance-wise.  What's
not to like?
Have you ever booted with init=/bin/sh to run fsck by hand, rebooted
immediately after it got done, and discovered that NONE of fsck's
writes hit the disk?  I have.  (It was an old fsck, I think it calls
sync now.  Still.)

If bdflush wakes you up, it thinks there aren't too many dirty
buffers.  Of course, it's probably wrong.  Which is an argument for
doing it your way.
Here's an interesting statistic:  I had a different version of my
patch that wrote max(bdf_prm.b_un.ndirty, nr_buffers*bdf_prm.b_un.nfract/100)
buffers, instead of checking every ndirty buffers whether the dirty
list had dropped below the required fraction.  I expected this to be
equivalent except for code appearance.
In reality, doing it this way you gain 50-75K/sec on every bonnie
operation except block writes, which lose 500K/sec!  I am not certain
what's doing this, but I think the problem is that bonnie keeps
generating dirty buffers while bdflush is writing.  With the
every-ndirty check, bdflush will keep writing; otherwise it goes to
sleep again and has to be reawakened.

I'm using 2.3 only, now; I don't think Linus wants either of our
patches in 2.2 after the 2.2.8 fiasco.

I'm going to keep pulling chunks out of your code, not to be rude but
because I think your buffer patch is trying to do too many things at
once.  I don't want to try to sort out which part of it is responsible
for performance deltas in either direction.
If you issue a patch versus 2.3.x that just does flushtime and
tasks start I/O directly, I will work relative to that.
