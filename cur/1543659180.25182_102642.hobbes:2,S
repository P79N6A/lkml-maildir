OK, now imagine the dcache locking changing a little bit.
You need to update this piece of (duplicated) code in half
a dozen places in just this function and no doubt in dozens
of other places all over fs/*.c.
From a maintenance point of view, a goto to a single block
of error handling code is easier to maintain.

Rik
