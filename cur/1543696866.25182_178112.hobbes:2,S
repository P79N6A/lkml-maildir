Renicing X? Many distributions (eg Mandrake) start X by default at 
a nice of -10 to make it more responsive. This is a workaround 
for the old scheduler limitations and the new scheduler makes 
this unecessary, and may actually promote audio skipping with 
this kernel. Each distribution may do this at different places 
but commonly in the file /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers there will be 
a line that looks like this: 
:0 local /bin/nice -n -10 /usr/X11R6/bin/X -deferglyphs 16
 change it to: 
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -deferglyphs 16
 Gustavo Franco gave me this on how to do it on Debian: 
# dpkg-reconfigure xserver-common
Manage X server wrapper configuration file with debconf? yes
Select what type of user has permission to start the X server. 2
Enter the desired nice value for the X server to use. 0
To check "cat /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config".
