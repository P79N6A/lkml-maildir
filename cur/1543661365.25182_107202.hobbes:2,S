Is that true? I thought the kernel build system added it with the
-include argument to gcc? And so it works properly _only_ if you're
using the correct way of building out-of-tree modules, which as
discussed recently on this list is
	make -C $LINUXDIR SUBDIRS=`pwd`
where LINUXDIR defaults to /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build unless the user
specifies otherwise.
Some distributions ship a kernel-source package which is broken and does
not work like this. File that as a bug if you encounter it.
