Subject: Linux 2.3.39 has 32bit uid. What about 32bit pid?

Hi,
  I have one question regarding 32bit kernel uids and ncpfs - ncpfs
exports __kernel_uid_t to userspace in couple of ioctl structures.
There is no problem with adding new structures with 32bit __kernel_uid32_t,
but some (two) of these structures include also __kernel_pid_t.
So I'd like to ask, whether we are going to 32bit pid_t in 2.3.
  If we do so, I can update this field in my ncpfs ioctl()s just now and 
it will save me from supporting just one more ioctl() interface version -
- either good old uid_t/gid_t/pid_t/mode_t or new uid32/gid32/pid32/mode...
(we are not going to change mode_t, are we?)
                                    Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
