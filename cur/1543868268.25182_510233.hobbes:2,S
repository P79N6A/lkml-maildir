Let's see, you manage to call mmc_remove_host() when a detection is pending in
the workqueue? That could indeed generate new request (up until mmc_free_host()
is called), but as the card is removed the mmc layer shouldn't be able to detect
anything, hence mmc_block should never get involved.

This is fixed in -mm. Making sure that nothing gets scheduled is the driver's
responsibility. I've added checks to catch broken drivers though.
