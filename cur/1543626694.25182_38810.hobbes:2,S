All P4s have a local APIC, however your bios can play a part in making it 
unavailable (global enable flag in apic base MSR). Please send me your 
dmesg.

Have you tried the various reboot kernel parameters? You can try the 
following.
reboot=w - Sets warm reboot flag
reboot=c - Sets cold reboot flag
reboot=b - Reboot via jump to BIOS
and finally if you're really desperate ;)
reboot=h - do a hard reboot, i think this is does a triple fault
