Nope, the kernel is always locked into memory.  If you take a page fault
from the kernel world, you will crash and burn. The kernel is never
"swapped out".  So if you are in kernel mode, going into do_page_fault
in arch/i386/mm/fault.c there is no path to swap a page in.  Even the
vmalloc_fault only handles a page not in the page global descriptor of
the current task.  But if this page is not mapped somewhere in memory
(not swapped out), you will get a kernel oops.
Kernel memory may never be swapped out. What happens if an interrupt
tries to use such memory. How does it handle sleeping?
Just change copy_to_user into memcopy, and see how long your system
stays up and running.  Do it on a machine that you don't need to worry
about rogue applications.  It won't last very long.
