    I.e. MWDMA2 should be working due to the way the driver is written (it 
sets up PIO4 timings when auto-tuning DMA) but not the other modes since 
speedproc() method is brain-damaged in this part.

    Another buglet found by random glancing at this driver:
/**
  *      cmd648_dma_stop -       DMA stop callback
  *      @qc: Command in progress
  *
  *      DMA has completed.
  */
static void cmd648_bmdma_stop(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc)
{
         struct ata_port *ap = qc->ap;
         struct pci_dev *pdev = to_pci_dev(ap->host->dev);
         u8 dma_intr;
         int dma_reg = ap->port_no ? ARTTIM23_INTR_CH1 : CFR_INTR_CH0;
         int dma_mask = ap->port_no ? ARTTIM2 : CFR;
         ata_bmdma_stop(qc);
         pci_read_config_byte(pdev, dma_reg, &dma_intr);
         pci_write_config_byte(pdev, dma_reg, dma_intr | dma_mask);
}
    dma_reg and dma_mask initializers must have been swapped since ARTTIM2 and 
CFR are regster names.  So, the code reads/writes semi-random regs...

    Sent what I had on this machine.  Will looks for newer revision of 
PCJ0646U2 spec elsewhere...
