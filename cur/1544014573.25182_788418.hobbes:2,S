One big change to irq_desc and a few smaller maintenance type updates.
	cpumask: update irq_desc to use cpumask_var_t
	cpumask: Use topology_core_cpumask()/topology_thread_cpumask()
	cpumask: convert misc driver functions

Based on tip/cpus4096: v2.6.28-5703-g1d1a70e
(Ingo - I added a blank line before the From: part and that seems to
separate it from the Subject.  Hopefully your git-am will still
recognizes it - I did try a git-am here and it seemed to work ok.)
