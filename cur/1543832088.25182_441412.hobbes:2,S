I decided to be brave, and see if I could get libata instead of the old
ide driver working on my laptop, and I got (mostly) success:
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=y
(and turn off CONFIG_IDE - that bit me for a while ;)

There's only one minor detail - although the CD is (AFAIK) a UDMA/33 device,
the hard drive and the controller are both able to do UDMA/100.
Now admittedly, the ide driver wasn't able to figure that out *either*, so
in a /etc/rc script I had:   '/sbin/hdparm -X udma5'.  But alas, that doesn't
work:
# hdparm -X udma5 /dev/sda 
/dev/sda:
 setting xfermode to 69 (UltraDMA mode5)
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(setxfermode) failed: Input/output error
1) How do I do the equivalent for a libata device?  Googling seems to hint
that hdparm can do it with a mythical patch by Jeff Garzik..
2) Should the kernel be able to autodetect it, and if so, what can I do
to help the code figure it out?
