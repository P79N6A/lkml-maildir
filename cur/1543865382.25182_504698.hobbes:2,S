Looks ok to me.

swsusp is protected by some giant "doing suspend" mutex. Other users
may be buggy :-).

I'd suggest step 0, remove as many PF_NOFREEZE as possible... ok, you
seem to be doing that one.

That looks bogus. If it is short term, it can as well live _without_
PF_NOFREEZE. Noone should suspend system at that stage, right?

Freezing _can_ take seconds. We do sync in between freezing userspace
and kernel, for example. We avoid freezing in some difficult situations
by waiting for I/O to complete....

Should be fixed. Someone was probably lazy.

Someone was definitely lazy :-).
