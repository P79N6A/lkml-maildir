NO, NO.
I boot with 2.5, and I make some work, I edit dsome text file
with jed and so on,
then I do a normal reboot in 2.4.17, without any fsck,
there is log reply, it is a normal reboot.
Well, some files get corrupted.
Please, notice, I even had been so lucky to check one of them immediatelly
before the reboot (with cat), it was safe, and after it was corruted.
Please note, are corrupted just files that i wrote in 2.5.3/4.
I saw I am not the only one with this kind of corruption, I remember at
less one related mail.
I have no problem to check any patch.
