Keep in mind that All the World's Not a PC.  No doubt those options are
enabled on the majority of kernels, by number, but linux supports many,
many types of systems, and I'll bet on fair number of them, it doesn't
make much sense to enable psaux mouse support!
So ... instead of saying `default y' for these options, how about saying
`default IM_ON_A_PC' where IM_ON_A_PC is defined somehow.  How, I don't
know; it could be a separate config question in a very obvious place,
perhaps itself having `default X86'.
Perhaps this should really be two flags, one IM_ON_A_PC meaning `typical
i386 pc with legacy devices', and the other, more general, being
something like IM_ON_A_WORKSTATION.  Then wierd things like psaux would
say `default IM_ON_A_PC', but more general things like keyboards would
say `default IM_ON_A_WORKSTATION'.
[Yeah, those names are sucky, I know...]
Thanks,
