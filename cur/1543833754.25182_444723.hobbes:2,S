Who said suid root? What about suid realtime or suid audio?

My point is not that they can lock up the machine. My point is that you 
just can't add a rt task to a rt system! A rt-system consists of a fixed 
set of threads, which in worst case can meet it's deadlines. If you add 
just one task you might break the whole system. Only someone with overview 
of the whole system can add those tasks.
It is very simple if you have only a audio application or only a driver 
needing low latencies. What if you have both? You have to make sure that 
the higher priority one leaves enough cpu for the lower priority one. And 
it is not a question of using a low percentage of cpu. It is a question of 
how long the cpu is used in one go and how often it can happen within the 
critical timeframe of the lower priority application.
You can make a system which checks that but it is much harder to do than 
a moving average. The only thing which makes sense is (a) square filter(s)
with a width equal to the required latency of the lower priority task(s).
So the sys-admin should somehow be able to give the right either to 
specific (audio) applications with specific priorities or a developer whom 
he trusts (and it does not make sense to give it to both as they would 
then mess it up for each other!)
We have discussed that total lock-up can be prevented with a simple 
watchdog. That solution doesn't need anything added into the scheduler.
