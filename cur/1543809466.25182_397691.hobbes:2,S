I just downloaded 2.6.13-rc3 and built it.  That has:
/sys/block/{loop0,loop1,loop2,loop3,loop4,loop5,loop6,loop7}
And those are the names mdev would use.  Turning /dev/loop# into /dev/loop/# 
has to be some kind of udev filter in the config file.
There are no duplicate dev nodes in /sys right now.  Check for yourself.  Grab 
all the names mdev would use:
find /sys -name dev | sed -e 's@^/sys/.*/\(.*\)/dev@\1@'
And then pipe that to sort | uniq -d
No hits on my ubuntu "flatulent badger" system.  I'm not saying there won't be 
any, I haven't tried plugging in a few usb memory keys and such.  (But it 
shouldn't be an overwhelming problem.  We could keep just the first one, 
stick a #2 on the second one...  I'll worry about it when it crops up.)

Don't look at the output of udev.  Look at the contents of /sys.

The current way sys handles things like "loop0" is to call it "loop0" rather 
than having a "loop" subdirectory with "0" under it.  If they changed that:
A) I'd whimper on the list and make puppy eyes.
B) I could turn loop/0 back into "loop0" if I had to.  Not too hard to do 
mechanically...
