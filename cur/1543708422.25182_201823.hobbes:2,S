If we take the vendor persåective here. Then why should they make their
driver open source, when the middle layer is not part of the 
main stream kernel?
So short-term I beleive the
"no open source drivers => no interest in IBAL"
is a bit to fast a conclusion.
Let's anyway see what they have, and give them feedback.
Based on the comments I have seen so far there is
a good chance to see open source drivers before IBAL is
considered ready for main stream kernel.
