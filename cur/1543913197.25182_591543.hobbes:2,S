Hello all,
I am trying to add syscall in include/asm/unistd.h:
static inline _syscall0(int,my_sys_call);
But I am getting following errors :
  AS      arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.o
include/asm/unistd.h: Assembler messages:
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: bad instruction `static inline int
my_sys_call(void){register long __res_r0 __asm__("r0")'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: bad instruction `long __res'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: bad instruction `__asm__
__volatile__("swi\t""(0x900000+322)""":"=r"(__res_r0)::"memory")'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: bad instruction `do {if((unsigned
long)(__res)>=(unsigned long)(-129)){errno=-(__res)'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: junk at end of line, first
unrecognized character is `}'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: junk at end of line, first
unrecognized character is `}'
include/asm/unistd.h:622: Error: junk at end of line, first
unrecognized character is `}'
make[1]: *** [arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/arm/kernel] Error 2
This was working in older versions.
I am curious _syscall0 still exists or obsolete in 2.6 linux.
And I have noticed even if I commented _syscall0 macro, I do not get
any errors so no body is using it , then why _syscall0 is in kernel
header files and what is the substitute of _syscall0.
Thanks for help,
Jaswinder Singh.
