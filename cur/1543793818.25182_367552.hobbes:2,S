Hi,
   I downloaded and built 2.6.15-rc1 as a test assuming Ingo will
release -rt support for this one of these days. (No rush Ingo!) It
booted on my AMD64 machine and is running fine AFAICT.
   One thing I was expecting to see was agpgart support for the
NForce4 chipset. Is this something that's coming or am I missing where
the configuration is done?
   I have a PCI-Express based Radeon and would like to get better
performance. I'm presuming that agpgart support is part of that
solution? (As it was on earlier architectures?)
Thanks,
Mark
