Yet another approach is to encode the kernel compile number in the 
kernel name. This only requires a very, very minor patch. I have described
how you can do this some time ago; you can find it at

Once, I wanted to make a mini-HOWTO of this document, but it was deemed
that the subject was not interesting enough for that by the mini-HOWTO
maintainer. He was probably right.
Good luck,
