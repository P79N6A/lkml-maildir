Hello all,
I run constantly in a problem with knfsd (or related) that looks like this:
After several hours clients cannot mount via nfs any more, they get:
db:/usr/src/packages/SOURCES # mount /backup
mount: admin:/p2/backup/db failed, reason given by server: Permission denied
On the server I get:
Dec 17 14:09:54 admin rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted 
This issue can always be solved by simply restarting the kernel nfs server.
Does this sound familiar to anybody? I tend to believe this is yet another
issue with knfsd getting into troubles with failed allocs. I can test whatever,
if someone tells me how and what.
Regards,
Stephan
