Me neither.  And it's not like the netfilter tools have
any interesting library dependencies either, ldd on
iptables for example is merely:
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/ultra3/libdl.so.2 (0x7002c000)
        libnsl.so.1 => /lib/ultra3/libnsl.so.1 (0x70040000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/ultra3/libc.so.6 (0x70068000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x70000000)
And that's just libc.
If Andi would code on kernel bug fixes for these problems
as much as he complained about them, he wouldn't have anything
to complain about :-)
I would like to see a netfilter compat layer translater engine
of some sort, none the less.  With the right design it won't
be hard to implement things properly.
