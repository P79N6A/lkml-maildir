Switching on #defines is easy to clean up; actually getting at the
older systems sounds like a PITA... OTOH OEM ID's are sort of too
simple to screw up aside from independent #defines that should be
visible issues on all systems. I'm not deeply concerned about this,
it merely appeared to dovetail into his goal of dynamic detection
and configuration of the APIC destination model. As far as we're
concerned, compile-time vs. runtime setup is probably not important.
