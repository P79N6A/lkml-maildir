With config entries you mainly define menu prompts and defaults. 
Dependencies are now properties of these prompts and defaults. With "if" 
you can define dependencies which are only attached to these prompts or 
defaults. Dependencies defined with "depends on" are attached to all of 
them defined within this menu entry.
Internally this becomes a simple list:
config MCA
  +- prompt "MCA support"
  |    +- depends on !(X86_VISWS || X86_VOYAGER)
  +- default y
       +- depends on X86_VOYAGER
If you enable the debug option of xconfig, this list is displayed with the 
help text.
bye, Roman
