Thanks.
Somewhere around 2.6.16.12 a call to audit_syscall_exit was added to 
vm86.c:
 static void do_sys_vm86(struct kernel_vm86_struct *info, struct task_struct *tsk)
 {
        struct tss_struct *tss;
+       long eax;
 /*
  * make sure the vm86() system call doesn't try to do anything silly
  */

This appears to have caused intermittent data corruption of the 
results of the vm86() call that the X server uses to get EDID data 
from the monitor via the VESA BIOS.  After removing the 
audit_syscall_exit() call, the problems mentioned in these bugzillas 
disappear:
Fetch of EDID 128 byte buffer by X server through vm86 INT 10 call is flaky.

RHEL 5 fails to get EDID data from monitor and sets low resolution

If I'm reading correctly, it appears that the code above trashes the 
%fs and %gs registers, or otherwise doesn't leave them at zero before 
returning from the system call as the old code did.  Is this a correct 
analysis?  How should this be fixed?
Thanks.
