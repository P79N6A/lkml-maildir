If /arc is not on a different hd it is probably a good idea to make 
sure test.tar.gz is small enough to fit into memory and has been read
at least once to be cache hot (that was the case with my test tar). 
Otherwise you're testing how fast the hd can seek between the two places 
and how far XFS and ext2 are away, and both are not very interesting.
