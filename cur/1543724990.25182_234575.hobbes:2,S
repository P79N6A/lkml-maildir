There is no technical difficulty, however, do notice there are other forms
of placement-restricted pagecache, i.e. blockdev pagecache, ramdisks, etc.

Allocations can be requested to come from restricted physical areas.
In this kind of situation, the OOM comes from exhaustion of a physical
area smaller than all of RAM, i.e. ZONE_NORMAL or ZONE_DMA.
The OOM decision-making is noteworthy:
        do_retry = 0;
        if (!(gfp_mask & __GFP_NORETRY)) {
                if ((order <= 3) || (gfp_mask & __GFP_REPEAT))
                        do_retry = 1;
                if (gfp_mask & __GFP_NOFAIL)
                        do_retry = 1;
        }
        if (do_retry) {
                blk_congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/50);
                goto rebalance;
        }
At the rebalance label, failure will only be delivered when the
check if (current->flags & (PF_MEMALLOC|PF_MEMDIE)), otherwise,
__alloc_pages() retries indefinitely and ignores signals.
Furthermore, notice the OOM killer will trip if out_of_memory() is
called more than 10 times in one second, which is plausible for a
single process to do, as it only sleeps for HZ/50 jiffies. More
interestingly, out_of_memory() is never called unless __GFP_FS is set.

There is no technical (or even practical) obstacle to implementing
in-core page relocation, only a social one: kernel politics. I would not
be surprised if hotplug memory patches already had code usable for this.
