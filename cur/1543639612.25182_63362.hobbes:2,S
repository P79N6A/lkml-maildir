	You could also put them in a manual hold queue. Give a large number of 
people ability to approve posts from that queue so latency would be 
reasonable.
	The problem with confirmation is that a person might fire off a bug report 
where they happen to be, via something like
dmesg > foo
joe foo
cat foo + mail -s "Bug report blah blah" linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
	A confirmation sent to the source address of that might not be noticed until 
the next time they happen to log into that account on that machine.
	You could do both, I guess. A hold queue that can be manually processed with 
confirmation posting the message and removing it from the hold queue.
