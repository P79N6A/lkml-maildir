Where do you see I'm saying that they must be non-static?
I'm all for marking functions static. I just did it for aic7xxx.

We already do it, but we don't have enough developers to audit
every driver for every possible combination of config options.
As a result, there always be some amount of unused functions and data.
Using --gc-sections will discard that.

Borland's Turbo Pascal was doing it ten+ years ago.
I don't understand why you are opposed to toolchain helping

I won't force anyone to select CONFIG_DISCARD_UNUSED_SECTIONS.
