Please don't go with informal talks and discussions. Please demand the numbers
and make decisions, conclusions based on those numbers. AFAIK, we haven't
posted confusing numbers so far.

Numbers I posted in the previous e-mail is the only story we have so far.

Sorry, These systems are huge and limited. We are raising the priority
with the performance team to do the latest slub patch testing.

We are trying to get the latest data with 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 with and without
slub. Is this good enough?

Ok. Atleast till all the regressions addressed and all these patches well
tested, we shouldn't do away with slab from mainline anytime soon.
Other than us, who else are you banking on for analysing slub? Do
you have any numbers that you can share, which show where slub
is good or bad...
