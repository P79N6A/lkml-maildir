	Hi there,
I noticed that when i changed to binutils 2.10.91 (Debian,woody)
i start to see messages like:
"Warning: Ignoring changed section attributes for .modinfo"
Chasing down the problem appeared that section modinfo is
declared for the first time as ".section .modinfo" without any
attributes. This is done by the including of linux/module.h.
The next declaration is ".section .modinfo,"a",@progbits".
And assembler moans on that line number.
Changing the declaration in linux/module.h to ".modinfo,"a""
fixed the problem, but i noticed that the author said that
"we want .modinfo to not be allocated"
I wonder why?
I already tried to allocate it (.modinfo,"a" in module.h) and
it seems to work.
Any ideas?
	Petkan
