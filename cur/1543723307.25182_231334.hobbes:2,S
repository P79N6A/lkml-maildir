This is still bad, I would prefer your Logitech mouse be identified
as such every time. Could you please try changing #undef DEBUG to
#define DEBUG in drivers/input/serio/i8042.c nad sending me 2 dmesg
oputputs - one when the mouse identified as "Generic" and one where
it is identified as "Logitech" - maybe I will see somethng there.
You might need log_buf_size=131072 kernel option to capture entire
dmesg and use "dmesg -s 131072" to dump it.
You can send the logs directly to me to not litter the mailing list.
> But no more oops. :^)
This is good ;) Still it was somewhat a stop-gap measure - something
else is going on - it was not supposed to hit that place in the
code yet.
Thank you for testing my patch.
