thanks Jason. I've merged all 3 into the kgdb-light tree to ease 
testing.
I think we should also try to do some self-tests, so that when one boots 
a bzImage with the self-tests activated it can be said that all the 
basic functionality works. Simulated via some loopback method, from 
within the kernel - not via a real serial line - but it should have the 
capability to do real single-stepping and inject real hw breakpoints and 
test that they work. What do you think?
