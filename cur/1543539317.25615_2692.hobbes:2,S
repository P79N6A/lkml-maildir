Riley posted about it in the past, although I don't remember
seeing anything recently.  It was mentioned that it would not get
into 2.4.0 so I figured that any porting efforts would continue
in the background until 2.5.x was unleashed...  Perhaps he has in
fact put it on hold.  Riley?  If you're reading this, please
respond.

Tis all over my head, but I wish someone would do the work to get
e2compr in the kernel for once and for all.  It would be a
fantastic thing to have indeed, and would be another step in the
direction of assimilating cool features from other OS's.  ;o)
Riley, any porting going on to 2.3.x?  Please post the URL for
the patches as well as I seem to have lost it...
Thanks,
