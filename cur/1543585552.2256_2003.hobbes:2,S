I'd be happy to generate one if I could.  I've got the system map.
The defaults reported by ksymoops are all correct.  Don't know why it
didn't give me more info.  Normally, the info is reported by klogd
anyway, but not here.  I've sent you all I currently have.  If you can
suggest how I can get more, would be glad to do so.
Take care,

I thought I was running v3.  Can't seem to find anything now which
indicates the protocol version in use, but was under the impression
that v4 was only an option in 2.4.x, no?  
Also, the system is in general *very* stable.  It will take quite a
while for this to resurface, I'd guess.
Take care,
