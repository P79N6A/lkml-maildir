Let's talk about subliminal messages, then. :)
How sensible would it be to have a runtime or  compile time option for
choosing between zero padding and  random values padding?  I think the
variable length of the  padding could cause some performance problems,
but I'm no kernel hacker nor cryptography expert.

Great.
