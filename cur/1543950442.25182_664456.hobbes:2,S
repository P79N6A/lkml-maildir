Hi,
   My proto board does not have a mmc card detect line to the mmc controller.
   So, I have to insert the card before i insmod the mmc drivers.
   If i change a card i have to rmmod and insmod the driver.
   I would like to know is there anyway i can make mmc to free up all the
   resources for the removed card. entries and reinitialise the new
card inserted if any
   without rmmod or insmod.
   I thought of using mmc_remove_host and mmc_add_host in the driver
which could be triggered by
   an application through sysfs entry.
   Are the calls mmc_remove_host and mmc_add_host the correct call to
use in this case?
Regards,
shri
