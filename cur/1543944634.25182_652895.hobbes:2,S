hm. But the raw sched_clock() use was wrong. We could either go back to 
jiffies (which is certainly the simplest and was used before 
printk_clock() was introduced which incorrectly relied on sched_clock()) 
- but that loses precision and the same issue will re-visit us once we 
go totally tickless and start to map jiffies to GTOD ...
so .. how about the patch below? Note that we already had an "early 
bootup" special (the rq->idle check), it's now just made explicit via 
the scheduler_running flag.

do not call sched_clock() too early. Not only might rq->idle
not be set up - but pure per-cpu data might not be accessible
either.
