But that's because "__preempt_spin_lock" on ppc is in the wrong section, 
no?
Just change it from "__sched" to "__lockfunc", and move it to 
kernel/spinlock.c while you're at it, and everything works right. Do the 
same for __preempt_write_lock() too.
Oh, and you need to do the "is_sched_function()" change too that I 
outlined in the previous email.
All in all, about four lines of code changes (+ some movement to make it 
all saner)
