    I know, but I use a 2.4.x kernel (which I didn't mention in my
original message, sorry O:)), and udev needs a 2.6.x kernel, am I
wrong?

    I have a do-it-yourself Linux box, so setting up udev is not much
of a problem as long as the kernel supports it. If udev doesn't use
any kernel magic (that is, it only uses /sbin/hotplug), how the heck
does it know which /dev/sd? the *kernel* assigned to my recently
plugged USB device? How can it influenciate which device is assigned
*by the kernel*? I assume that it needs some magic from the kernel
and so it only works for 2.6.x :???? In fact, if it uses sysfs, it
still needs a 2.6.x for that, am I wrong?
    I'll take a look anyway, thanks a lot for your message and help :)
