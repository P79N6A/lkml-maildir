Well, the code we have now has worked for quite some years as-is.  This
code is not an algorithmic change.  I haven't seen any machines which
need outb(0xff, 0x64) -- I wonder if that has the same effect as our
io_delay() or if it is actually potent.  I shall look into it.

Are you talking about BP or DS?  As I said, the BP is well-known, and
the code accounts for it in the form of the INT10 macro.

Not with an %fs: prefix.  It would also allow the compiler to do a move
into a register "on its own", which would be disastrous, since it would
lack the prefix.  So "m" is correct.
