I guess this would make problems with the incremental patches.
I think putting an official patch for 2.4.20 closing the ptrace hole on
www.kernel.org should be no problem, and people compiling the kernel
themselves could easily use a correctly patched kernel. The main problem
(IMHO) is finding the correct patch. Even a link to the mail in the
archive might be sufficient.
(I hope this has not been suggested before, I was unsubsribed to lkml
for some days)
