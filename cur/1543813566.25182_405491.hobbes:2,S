On SMP systems, something based on the run queues' raw_weighted_load 
fields (comes with smpnice patch) might be more useful than nr_running() 
as it contains information about the priority of the running tasks. 
Perhaps (raw_weighted_load() > SCHED_LOAD_SCALE) or some variation, 
where raw_weighted_load() is the sum of that field for all CPUs) would 
suffice.  It would mean "there's more than the equivalent of one nice==0 
task running" and shouldn't be any more expensive than nr_running(). 
Dividing SCHED_LOAD_SCALE by some number would be an obvious variation 
to try as would taking into account this process's contribution to the 
weighted load.
Also if this was useful there's no real reason that raw_weighted_load 
couldn't be made available on non SMP systems as well as SMP ones.
