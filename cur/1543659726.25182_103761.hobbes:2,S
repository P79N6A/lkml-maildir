Looks almost ready.  Could you make up a 2.5 version first?  I don't
like to have new features in 2.4 before they go into 2.5.

Can you just make this a normal function then, with a more private name?

Thanks for documenting this and get_adapter_speed().

Ick, why?  Just for a debugging message?  That /proc file is on the
short list of things to delete :)

Where are you getting the PCI_SPEED_50MHz_PCIX value from?  I took these
values from the Hotplug PCI draft spec.  Has 02 been reserved for 50MHz
PCIX and the other values changed?
If it's not in the spec, I'd recommend adding it to the end of the list,
with a big comment about why it's different from the spec values.
thanks,
