yes I've a 150k compressed updated driver from Thomas Winischhofer in my
inbox for Marcelo that should fix those bugs (that would obsolete the
non complete 00_sis-fpu-bugs-1), I thought it was merged in mainline but
obviously not as 00_sis-fpu-bugs-1 wouldn't apply anymore. I guess
Marcelo rejected it because it was very big and it wasn't fix the strict
fpu bugs revealed by the -msoft-float, just guessing.

yes it's related, reverting it would hide the bug, the module would
load again but userspace could be corrupted at runtime.
