Thanks for the reply! I've got some weirdness though.  I thought I had tried
this about a week ago (setting can_queue to 0 in fdomain.h) but just to make
sure I tried again.  Now if I set can_queue to 0 the kernel doesn't even make
it through the boot sequence, it freezes just after detecting the SCSI
adapter, i.e. right after:
...
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
scsi0: <fdomain> No BIOS; using scsi id 7
scsi0: <fdomain> TMC-36C70 (PCI bus) chip at 0xec00 irq 11
scsi0 : Future Domain 16-bit SCSI Driver Version 5.50
scsi : 1 host
and I mean freeze, no scrollback even.  It should detect the drive at this
point but doesn't.
  I'm really clueless now.  I might try to play with some queue logging to
see if I can get it to tell me any more.
Thanks again for the reply,

Note: the irq above is different from my previous post because I hopped the
card to another slot to see if that would get it to boot, it didn't.
