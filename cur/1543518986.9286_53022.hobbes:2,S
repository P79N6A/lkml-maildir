Oh, my... Yes, I see what you are looking for, but... Without the
information about inode being modified - no. _If_ you are only after data
(not positional metadata) you can kinda-sorta kludge it up, but that will
take placing all bloody buffer_heads back into the cache and doing
pretty non-trivial synchronizations. For indirect blocks - forget it. For
references right in the inode - maybe, but little good it will do you,
considering the previous. For _anything_ in directories - hell, no. We are
holding to much state to allow anything like that.
	For somewhat better approach you might consider passing the
<address_space, logical address> instead of <physical address>. That
might be more or less bearable. Especially combined with something a-la
leases.

It's not a question ;-/
