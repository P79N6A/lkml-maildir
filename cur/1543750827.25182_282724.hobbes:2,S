Hi and thanks for the response.
Just one more question, what is the '64 cpus' that you are referring to? 
The ./arch/x86_64/Kconfig file states:
---
# actually 64 maximum, but you need to fix the APIC code first
# to use clustered mode or whatever your big iron needs
config NR_CPUS
        int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-8)"
        range 2 8
        depends on SMP
        default "8"
        help
          This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
          kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 32 and the
          minimum value which makes sense is 2.
          This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU requires
          memory in the static kernel configuration.
---
Can you clarify this as:
- the comments says 64 CPUs,
- the code says 8 CPUs, and
- the help text says 32 CPUs.
The company I work for is looking at IBM x445 servers which support up to
32 processors (although this is via NUMA-Q).  Are NUMA-Q boxes also
subject to the 8 CPU limit?
Thanks
