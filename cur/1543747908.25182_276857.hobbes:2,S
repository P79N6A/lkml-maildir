The current DRI drivers don't really deal much with PCI devices. A pure
PCI video card on 64bit boxes might be problematic although I'd question
the sanity of anyone doing this 8)

I'd assumed video card vendors were non-legacy but ok

Andrew certainly believes this is. Certainly in 2.4 it was not.

If the VM can take it and get it right I am all for a 512Mb or 1Gb DMA
region to fix the various devices that have 29-31bit DMA issues. If it
fixes Nvidia's needs to then fine.
