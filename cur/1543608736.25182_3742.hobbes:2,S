I too am confused.  More so, the difference between hard_get_current and
get_current is confusing.  I further question things because I suspect
there is a problem: hard_get_current is commented as "for within NMI,
do_page_fault, cpu_init" but all these functions call other functions
that may very well use get_current.  How is this going to work?
Further, the preemptible kernel patch oopses with this patch (IOW, don't
use 2.4.13-ac8 + preempt-kernel, unless you remove all these bits like I
did :>).  I think it may be because of:

this change but I am unsure.  Would Manfred or someone knowledgeable in
this mind letting me pick their brain?
