Hi Andrew,
I've been fighting a similar problem to this one on a SpecSFS setup
that Im running and it seems that this patch fixes it.  While I was
trying several other patches at the time (all of them not dcache
related) and its hard right now to measure the exact improvement
percentage,  I would guess that these patches provides at least a 
11% improvement on my 64GB machine.
BTW: I was using JFS on my setup.
Thanks
