snapshot/restart/migration worry me.  If they require complete
serialisation of complex kernel data structures then we have a problem,
because it means that any time anyone changes such a structure they need to
update (and test) the serialisation.
This may be a show-stopper, in which case maybe we only need to virtualise
pid #1.

ok.
Anyway.  Thanks, guys.  It sound like most of this work will be nicely
separable so we can think about each bit as it comes along.
