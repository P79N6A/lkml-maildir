The tradeoff when implemented correctly is that writes will tend to be
more spread out and reads should be better clustered together.

Certainly, keeping ours eyes open is a good a good thing.
But it has been apparent for a long time that by doing allocation as
we were doing it, that when it came to heavy swapping we were taking a
performance hit.  So I'm relieved that we are now being more aggressive.
From the sounds of it what we are currently doing actually sucks worse
for some heavy loads.  But it still feels like the right direction.
It's been my impression that work loads where we are actively swapping
are a lot different from work loads where we really don't swap.  To
the extent that it might make sense to make the actively swapping case
a config option to get our attention in the code.  It would be nice
to have a linux kernel for once that handles heavy swapping (below
the level of thrashing) gracefully. :)
