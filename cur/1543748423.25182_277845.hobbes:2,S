i think this could be the effect of the "CPU loop" being at a lower
priority (prio 30?) than all of the IRQ threads. The SMP scheduler is
now better at distributing high-prio RT tasks i.e. of IRQ threads, all
of which are higher prio than the CPU loop.
could you do one run with the CPU loop being prio 90, soundcard IRQ
being prio 91 and timer IRQ being prio 92 - so that we can see what the
RT kernel could be capable of, if the IRQ threads didnt interfere?
also, i'd like to take a look at latency traces, if you have them for
this run.
