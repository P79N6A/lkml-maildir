As I said earlier ide_mm_inb etc via the function pointers tf_inb/tf_outb
etc.
Given how small those functions are it might even be worth rolling them
into two different versions of the functions like ide_tf_read as surely
it costs more to call them (in size) than to inline the two for those
functions?
