No. Hint: What is PAGE_OFFSET?
Everything the CPU executes/reads/writes is translated from physical (bus)
addresses to virtual addresses.
What you may have heard or read is that the address-space that the
kernel uses for its code and resident data has fixed translation tables
which means one doesn't have to scan a bunch of tables to locate the
bus address, given the virtual address.
physical_address = virtual_address  - PAGE_OFFSET;
virtual_address  = physical_address + PAGE_OFFSET;
This is totally an artifact of how the page-tables are set up.
