Seems some inconsistency in the way how the irlan netdev is handled:
having NETIF_F_DYNALLOC set for a netdev which is not allocated as an
independent object doesn't seem to be a good idea to me ;-)
The patch below simply removes NETIF_F_DYNALLOC just before calling
unregister_netdev() und should fix the issue. It's untested however,
since I'm unable to reproduce the Oops on UP without preempt (but it
should be there as well, due to ipfrag_time for example). At least it
compiles and doesn't do any harm to me.
IMHO, retiring dynalloc is just some sort of band-aid because I do
believe, using it would be a good idea - but would need some more
changes for irlan.
Btw., I'm not sure about the status of irlan - I'm only using ppp over
ircomm or irnet.
