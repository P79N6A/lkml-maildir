Hi Michael
Is yours the 15" model or the 17"? Mine is 15" and the product id is  
0x0214.

I haven't looked at your changes completely yet but are you saying it  
works? Meaning mouse
moves properly?
Also I find it strange that your model requires 80 bytes ATP_DATASIZE  
- mine isn't happy
at all with anything less than 256. The less number of sensors you  
defined is again a puzzle.

If the format of the data is same (which looks like it is with your  
model) then yes, but in my case
the data arrives is 64 byte blocks - there are 4 of them in one  
transfer, each a reading on it's own.
Hmm. More confusion.
Thanks
Parag
