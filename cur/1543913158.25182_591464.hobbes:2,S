Davide,
As I think about this more, I see more problems with
your argument.  timerfd needs the ability to get and 
get-while-setting just as much as the earlier APIs.
Consider a library that creates a timerfd file descriptor that
is handed off to an application: that library may want
to modify the timer settings without having to create a
new file descriptor (the app mey not be able to be told about
the new fd).  Your argument just doesn't hold, AFAICS.
Cheers,
Michael
