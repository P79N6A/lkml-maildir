It ensures that the total number of anonymous and/or tmpfs (eg anon shared)
pages that are mappable will fit in swap (or in mode 2 swap + 0.5*ram). You
never get a SIGBUS. Writes to tmpfs for new blocks will fail if that would
place the system in a potential overcommit situation.

It isnt the alloc pages that is the problem.
You mmap - no pages are allocated. You use them , pages get allocated. If
you look at the actual maps you'll find a lot of people allocate an area
of address space but don't use it all. Without the address overcommit
management nothing guarantees that when you touch those pages you won't
fault. Furthermore unless you are very careful you may fault again on
the stack push for the SIGBUS and if that faults - SIGKILL->OOM time
