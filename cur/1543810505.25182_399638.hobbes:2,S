Hmm, atkbd only detects "repeated" keystrokes if it is working in
hard-repeat mode:
        value = atkbd->release ? 0 :
                                (1 + (!atkbd->softrepeat &&
test_bit(atkbd->keycode[code], atkbd->dev->key)));
Should we always recognize "repeats"? Then we woudl not need any
workarounds, be it kbdrate or sysfs.
