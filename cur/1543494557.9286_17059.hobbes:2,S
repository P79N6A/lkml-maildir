I bet this is a 2.0.x kernel. I have seen the same on 2.0.33 and 2.0.34.
2.0.34 "went crazy" after some days of uptime. Haven't tried newer
versions on the problematic machine (an amd 486 120).
But it seems to be harless - it's just the number. And it's not
realistic - it's much higher than the uptime.
This has not influenced anything afaics, last time the uptime got to 230
w/2.0.33, currently it's over 80 days.
