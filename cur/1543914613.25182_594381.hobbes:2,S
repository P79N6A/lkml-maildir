Well, user1's operations would fail if done from the client, which is
why I mentioned that they would have to be done on the server.
The second point is a good one, but POSIX says that it should be allowed
if the permissions allow for it. The whole situation is somewhat
contrived anyway, I can't think of a place where this is something
you'd really want to do, but I think we need to try to follow the spec
as best as possible...

Right. When I was first looking at this, I considered some similar
approaches, but hit roadblocks with all of them. The only real option
seems to be to leave this to the server, but that does assume that the
server handles this properly.
Servers that don't are broken, IMO. If Irix isn't clearing these bits
on a write then it might be good to see if they can fix that...
