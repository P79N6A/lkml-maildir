Agreed.

If you look more carefully at how the emergency mempools are used, I think
you'll better understand why I did this:
Look at patch 9/9, specficially the changes to kmem_getpages():
-	page = alloc_pages_node(nodeid, flags, cachep->gfporder);
+	/*
+	 * If this allocation request isn't backed by a memory pool, or if that
+	 * memory pool's gfporder is not the same as the cache's gfporder, fall
+	 * back to alloc_pages_node().
+	 */
+	if (!pool || cachep->gfporder != (int)pool->pool_data)
+		page = alloc_pages_node(nodeid, flags, cachep->gfporder);
+	else
+		page = mempool_alloc_node(pool, flags, nodeid);
Allocations backed by a mempool must always be allocated via
mempool_alloc() (or mempool_alloc_node() in this case).  What that means
is, without a mempool_alloc_node() function, NO mempool backed allocations
will be able to request a specific node, even when the system has PLENTY of
memory!  This, IMO, is unacceptable.  Adding more NUMA-awareness to the
mempool system allows us to keep the same slab behavior as before, as well
as leaving us free to ignore the node requests when memory is low.
