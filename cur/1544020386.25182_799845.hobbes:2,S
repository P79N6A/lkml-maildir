SCSI error handling happens in dedicated per-Scsi_Host threads.  These
look like candidates for some kind of thread pool implementation too
though (like Arjan's kernel/async.c), especially since a Scsi_Host
instance is sometimes actually a per-target instance.
But I thought primarily about scsi_add_device and scsi_remove_device and
friends.  Incidentally, device probing is exactly what Arjan's fastboot
facility is targeting.  (Sometimes device shutdown is slow too and wants
to be parallelized versus other bus event handling then.)
