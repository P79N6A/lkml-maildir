Depends on what's going on.  What if you have a two socket machine, and 
one CPU is in C3 when the latency setting occurs?  Shouldn't you wake it 
up and prevent it from going that deep again?  But you're right, you 
won't necessarily improve anything...

Right, that's the idea.  A printk may be overkill but some kind of 
notification might be nice, for similar reasons to the below.

Well, I was imagining a scenario where you didn't really want to disallow 
C3 for whatever reason (maybe some standard you're following requires 
it), so your minimum latency would be N usec.  You'd definitely want to 
know about any device that required < N usecs of latency (at boot or 
driver init time) so that you'd know you had a bad device or system.
