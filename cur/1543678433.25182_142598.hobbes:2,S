Team,
I got failure on compiling the kernel in one of SuperMicro signle CPU system.  It has a Linux 2.4.2 on it.  
The message is "Unknown Pseudo-op:  '.incbin'"
The file brings the trouble is arch/i386/kernel/vsyscall.S.
I think it must be a configuration problem but don't know which one is causing the trouble. I am using menuconfig to change the configuration.
Any suggestion?
Thanks!
Eddie
