Ok, I've thought some more but I still don't know ...

So, how *should* an isdn4linux driver handle a request to suspend?
Specifically, if there are active connections, should it try to
shut them down in an orderly fashion (which might imply some delays
waiting for the remote station to acknowledge, etc.)? Should it kill
them abruptly (as for a USB unplug event)? Or should it just refuse
to suspend while a connection is still active?
Thanks for any insights,
Tilman
