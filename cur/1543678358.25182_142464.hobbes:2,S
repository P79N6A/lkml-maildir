True, and then gdb works much better as well.  I was really thinking about 
production quality.  Well, I want to have it all, I wonder if the gcc crew 
could come up with a compile speed optimization switch, which produces sucky 
code but does it in record time.
There are many other ways of improving kernel build speed of course.  One of 
the best was to use Keith Owen's kbuild 2.5, which did an impressive job of 
speeding the build up, especially the incremental stuff that matters most to 
developers.  But alas, it died on the horns of politics.

If that's the case then it's a good sign I think.
