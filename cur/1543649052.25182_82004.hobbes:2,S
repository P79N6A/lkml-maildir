I got a patch for that which *almost* works. The disks spin down, but the
console is still there. But when I hit the power button I don't have to
hold it, the system goes down like a rock, so it's doing more than it did.
In uni mode it goes all the way down, and I'm not sure the patch is quite
right, I just haven't had time to fight with it. Every once in a while I
have to do some work to keep the lights on.
