The previous problem was just a display shift of 6 pixels, correct?  If
the display is now scrambled, then this is a new problem.

It's useless to unset CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE to 'n', he'll just end
up with a 640x400 stretched or windowed display.
Can he...
1. describe what 'scrambled' means?
2. Boot with video=intelfb:accel=0,<old options>?
3. post the output of 'fbset -i' and the latest dmesg?
4. change the color depth ('fbset -depth 16')?
5. If possible, run X using 'fbdev' as the driver at 16 bpp
   (I don't think 32 bpp works with X-fbdev)?
