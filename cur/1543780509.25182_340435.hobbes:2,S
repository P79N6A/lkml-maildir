That would be very helpful. That should cover the remaining (ab)users
of PageReserved.
It would probably be fastest to implement this with a page flag,
however if swsusp and ioremap are the only users then it shouldn't
be a problem to go through slower lookups (and this would remove the
need for the PageValidRAM flag that I had worried about earlier).
