	My linux-2.6.23/drivers/md/raid5.c contains your patch for a long time :
...
         spin_lock(&sh->lock);
         clear_bit(STRIPE_HANDLE, &sh->state);
         clear_bit(STRIPE_DELAYED, &sh->state);
         s.syncing = test_bit(STRIPE_SYNCING, &sh->state);
         s.expanding = test_bit(STRIPE_EXPAND_SOURCE, &sh->state);
         s.expanded = test_bit(STRIPE_EXPAND_READY, &sh->state);
         /* Now to look around and see what can be done */
         /* clean-up completed biofill operations */
         if (test_bit(STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL, &sh->ops.complete)) {
                 clear_bit(STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL, &sh->ops.pending);
                 clear_bit(STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL, &sh->ops.ack);
                 clear_bit(STRIPE_OP_BIOFILL, &sh->ops.complete);
         }
         rcu_read_lock();
         for (i=disks; i--; ) {
                 mdk_rdev_t *rdev;
                 struct r5dev *dev = &sh->dev[i];
...
but it doesn't fix this bug.
