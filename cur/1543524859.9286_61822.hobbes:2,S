I boot here from an Ultra-66 device. I am using 2 20 Gig IBM Drives on
an HPT-366 interface attached to an Abit Mboard. I know the docs for Andrea's
kernel patch say it will not boot but it does boot here just fine. I am 
using 2.2.14 with Mingo's raid patches and Jens Axboe's dvd+ide patch.
As I understand it the dvd+ide patch is a combination of Andre Hedrick's
UDMA patch and Jens dvd patch. I have been running it for approx a month 
I think. I put it up shortly 2.2.14 and the patches were available. I enabled
RAID 1 on the 2 disks yesterday. It has been up about 22 Hrs. and so far so
good. If you think it might be useful I can send you the kernal configuration.
Let me know.
Hope this helps.
