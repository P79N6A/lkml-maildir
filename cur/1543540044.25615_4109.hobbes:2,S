This is not very difficult and has been done already on other UNIXes,
at least on OSF and Solaris many years ago. The trick is to stash micro
or nanosecond fractions in the spare fields of the struct stat. Really,
second resolution is no good these days when small source files can be
compiled in a fraction of a second:
	iapetus ~ cat hello.c
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(void)
	{
		printf("Hello world!\n");
		return 0;
	}
	iapetus ~ time gcc -c hello.c
	0.04user 0.02system 0:00.04elapsed 127%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
	0inputs+0outputs (680major+200minor)pagefaults 0swaps
	iapetus ~ time gcc -c hello.c
	0.04user 0.01system 0:00.04elapsed 106%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
	0inputs+0outputs (680major+200minor)pagefaults 0swaps
Internal times on NFS already have microsecond resolution (struct timeval).
