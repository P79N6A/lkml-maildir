It reminds me of the old days using Xenix on '286, and the 5 different
memory models that you got with C on MSDOS:
	int	16 bits
	long	32 bits
There were compiler switches to control pointer size:
	code *	16 or 32 bits	)
	data *	16 or 32 bits	) gives 4 different combinations
				  The 5th was HUDGE, but can't recall what
				  was special about it.
You also needed 4 versions of libraries.
It all worked, but was vile, I hated it. It was done because that was
the only way of doing it on an 8086/80286 -- unless you were sensible
enough to move to a motorola 68k.
OK, so do this vile hack, I will hate it. If I really need to go > 2Gb I
will be sensible & move to an alpha (or something).
