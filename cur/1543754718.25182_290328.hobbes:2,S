Patch is alredy sent, but probably it will not apper in the nearest -mm
release.

Most of it's exports are preparation for EEPROM driver, which will
require
some changes in w1 core(it needs to export additional callbacks).
I'm currently review DS device set to find any dependency upon ds2490
chip - 
but it looks like there is no one, so it is alredy not core, but device
driver
itlself.
I'm not too religious about it's name...
