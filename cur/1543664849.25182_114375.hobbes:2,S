Would it be possible for you to test Arjan's irqbalance daemon?
We believe it is a superior solution to in-kernel irq balancing, but
also, can be safely used in addition to in-kernel irq balancing.
(we just have not run benchmarks to prove this yet :))

This userspace solution is shipping with current Red Hat, and is
portable to non-ia32 architectures.
