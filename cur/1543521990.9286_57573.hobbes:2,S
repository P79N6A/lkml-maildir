Hi guys,
Thanks to all who tried and sent me suggestions on the patch I sent ages
ago:
  
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/bcp-2.3.36-pre5.patch
which implements a simple BCP (boot command processor) that lets you dump
and tweak the boot command line and overcomes the <79 bytes limitation of
some patches versions of LILO distributed with some distributions (RedHat,
SuSE etc).
What I wanted to ask is - what features would you like me to add to it,
other than what has already been suggested, i.e.:
  a) dump/tweak other stuff, e.g. vga mode.
  b) load an alternative kernel image, possibly from a BFS filesystem,
     similar to the /stand slice handling done in UnixWare boot code.
Any other ideas?
Thanks,
