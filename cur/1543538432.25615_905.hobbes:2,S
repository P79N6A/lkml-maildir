Can't remember. - You could compare and find out... - I only use the 2.3/4 
kernel for development ATM. - Recently, I have only looked at the 2.2.x 
code once in order to backport my patches from 2.3/4 to 2.2...

We are all very well aware of the fact that NTFS is very broken concerning 
write support. But there are some known problems with the read support, 
too. - The probably worst I know of so far being that it eats buffers for 
breakfast until the box runs out of memory and processes start to fail 
(e.g. fork fails with out of memory error)...

Um. I don't think you can blame a file system for over-heating a hard 
disk... (I hope I am not missing a joke here!)
It just makes it get used a lot so maybe your disk is not sufficiently 
cooled? What disk is this? rpm? - I find my 7200rpm disk runs extremely hot 
(to say: well above what IBM says it is safe to run at!) even in windows if 
I disable the hd cooling unit stuck in front of it, so I wouldn't blame the 
linux ntfs driver for this effect.

That's some bookmarks you might find useful:
http://www.fsys.demon.nl/fsinfo.htm

The following books contain some information on NTFS but this is not their 
primary focus:
Windows NT/2000 Native API Reference
by Gary Nebbett
Macmillan Technical Publishing USA
ISBN 1-57870-199-6
Inside Windows NT Second Edition
by David A. Solomon
Microsoft Press
ISBN 1-57231-677-2
The macmillan book is quite a handy reference if you are doing NT/2000 
programming.
The microsoft book is not too deeply technically involved but it is a good 
overview of how NTFS works.
HTH,
