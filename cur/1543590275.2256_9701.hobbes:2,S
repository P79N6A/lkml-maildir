Is there a way in linux to montior file writes?
I have something that is writing to the disk every 5:th second (approx.)
And I don't know what it is.. In windows I had a small program called
FileMonitor that where quite good in this situation.
Is there such a program i linux? If not, is it because the kernel does not
provide this information. Maybe there is needed some new hooks to make it
possible?
