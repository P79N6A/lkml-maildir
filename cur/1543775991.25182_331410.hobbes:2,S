key for this one is to make sure we separate the cases carefully, and
not end up with one big bucket of "something broke" that has a gazilion

For the cases where a vm layout thing is suspected of causing the
breakage we also really need a /proc/<pid>/maps *at the time of the
breakage* realistically for doing any kind of diagnostics.
