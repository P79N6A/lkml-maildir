How? If it has just been loaded from disk, and it has got all the memory
it will need (not COW shared with other processes) then it will never
experience failed memory allocation. If it is taking too much VM, it may
be killed to free up resources, until we can use memory usage deltas to
select the process to kill. There is, however, NOTHING "overcommitted"
here.

Yes, I know there is SOME memory - but is it enough for ANY operation to
succeed?

Apache depends entirely on COW (overcommit) to fit in memory. Without it,
my 100 simultaneous HTTP sessions of a 20Mb daemon would take 2Gb of VM.
This is not practical. WITH COW overcommit, however, it's nearer 30Mb.
Besides, disabling COW overcommit does NOT avoid OOM situations - it
CAUSES them!
Yes, enabling /proc/sys/vm/overcommit can lead to strange failures in OOM
situations - so what? You would still have the problem, it just has
different symptoms.

Yes - because you are still running out of memory. However you used the
memory in the first place, you have now run out of it, and something has
to die to remedy that.

The problem is not overcommitted memory, but simply *USED* memory. Once
you have allocated all your memory to processes, subsequent memory
allocation attempts will fail. This causes processes to die.
As it happens, I do have this set to 0. However, out of memory conditions
can and will still occur, and processes will die as a result. This has
nothing to do with overcommit, COW or anything else - it's just run out of
this particular resource.
