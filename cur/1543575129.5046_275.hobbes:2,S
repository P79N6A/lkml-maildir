Please do. You might leave them commented out right now, but this is
actually how most of the pirq router entries have been created: by looking
at various pirq tables and matching them up with other (non-pirq)
documentation and testing. Th epirq "link" value is basically completely
NDA'd, and is per-chipset-specific. Nobody documents it except in their
bios writers guide, if even there.

Yes.

Not intended behaviour. The self case should be removed.

Ok, definitely needs some more work. Thanks for testing - I have no
hardware where this is needed.
