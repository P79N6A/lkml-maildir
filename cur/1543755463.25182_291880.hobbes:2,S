Well most likely not although I haven't been able to detect much
difference. But in your case you would probably be happy to live
with that if it meant better parallelising of an important
function... but we'll leave future discussion to another thread ;)

Oh yes, but suppose your page_cache_get is happening at the same time
as free_pages_check, after the page gets freed by the scanner? I can't
actually think of anything that would cause a real problem (ie. not a
debug check), off the top of my head. But can you say there _isn't_
anything?
Regardless, it seems pretty dirty to me. But could possibly be made
workable, of course.
