I will look at 2.2 to see how it can be done. This leaves us with the
question whether it should be done, or in other words, what does our gfl
(great fearless leader) want us to do.
Can I assume there is approval for the dotted notation ? If so what should
the module parameter be ? Only feature= (inconsistent) or driver.feature=
(clumsy) ?
IMHO there should be a callback to the pci layer which should allow me to
declare that I have enabled a resource.
