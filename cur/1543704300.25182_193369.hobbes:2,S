Subject: atkbd w 2.6.2rc1 : HowTo for extra (inet) keys ?

Hello again.
I just reverted my atkbd.c code to your version (Linus's tree) and 
unfortunately have 4 keys 'missing' from my HP Omnibook XE3GC extra "internet 
keys".
Question 1: Can I fix the table from userland, using some utility? That is, 
can I upload an updated table into the kernel, so that I don't have to 
reboot?
Q 2: Do you have any HowTo/QA for that?
Q 3: Will that work under X? (which AFAIK reads the 'raw' codes)
Q 4: It has been rather difficult for me to compute the scancodes needed for 
the table. Could you put the "formula" onto the HowTo?
Thanks.
FYI, the codes are:
"www": Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf3 on isa0060/serio0).
"Mail":  Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf4 on isa0060/serio0).
"Launch": Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf2 on isa0060/serio0).
"Help":  Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf1 on isa0060/serio0).
