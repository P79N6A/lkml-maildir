For the A8V series of boards, that will almost certainly be just fine, 
because as far as I know you can't populate them with more than 4G of 
memory anyway.
If someone has more than 4G of memory, it's likely they'll be willing to 
take the performance hit from the mod in exchange for being able to use 
more than 4G of memory.
Bottom line: do the patch.  It'll be worth using.
