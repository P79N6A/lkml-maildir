Subject: 2.6.16.20 fails to boot on SATA system but works on IDE

After failing to get 2.6.17-rc6 working on a HP dc7600U I went back
to 2.6.16.20. It also fails to find any volume group during boot.
I think this might be problem with SATA as I can boot the same build on
two other systems that have IDE disks.
I get success on VIA Epia M10000 and a P4 Shuttle systems that use
IDE disks but fail on the HP dc7600U that uses a SATA disk. All three
systems use LVM2.
The Fedora build of 2.6.16 works on all three systems.
I'm going to see if there are debug messages I can turn on it libata
and md that might give more information.
Any suggestions as to what I can do to track down this problem?
Barry
