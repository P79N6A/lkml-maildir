Yes, but its syncing is superfluous anyway, as mentioned in the other 
post.  *If* it is doing something for Jarod's setup, then only because 
of side effects like memory barrier properties.

I think so too.  GFP_DMA32 would be appropriate on machines with 
"software IOMMU" alias swiotlb.
Does GFP_DMA32 have adverse affects on machines with a real IOMMU?
