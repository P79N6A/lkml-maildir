While this is the kind of thing I like to hear, it wasn't really what I
was asking ;-)
There was a regression between a 2.6.3 mandrake kernel and 2.6.6, was
this regression just for reiserfs or was it for all filesystems?
If just reiserfs, it might be from the data=ordered and logging changes
that went into 2.6.6, so I'm quite interested in figuring things out.
