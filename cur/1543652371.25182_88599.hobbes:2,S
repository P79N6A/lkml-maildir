Subject: how to export a symbol so that I can use it in a module

Hi,
I've added a function "create_tcp_port_number" to net/core/utils.c
like this:
int create_tcp_port_number(void)
{
/* blah blah */
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(create_tcp_port_number);
in include/linux/net.h I added:
extern int create_tcp_port_number(void);
So, now in net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c I used this 'create_tcp_port_number'
function. I'm compiling the kernel with ipv6 as a module. And that's
where I get the problem. In the last stage, the makefile does a
depmod and then I get:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/net/ipv6/ipv6.o
depmod:         create_tcp_port_number
I'm really out of ideas what can be the cause of this. It must be
something trivial, but I cannot find the solution. Anyone who can
help me?
Thank you.
