Does anybody have suggestions for AMD K6-2-specific kernel
optimizations?
I wanted to play around with the new processor I have, but am not
familiar enough with its architecture (or rather, the differences
between a Pentium and a K6-2) to know exactly what sort of changes would
benefit K6-2 kernels the most.
Thanks,
	Jeff
