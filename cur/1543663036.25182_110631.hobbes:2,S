Hi all,
I tried the following:
[root@frodo linux-2.5.61]# make rpm
make: *** No rule to make target `clean', needed by `rpm'.  Stop.
Not because I really need an rpm kernel, just because I wanted
to try the process.
I looked at the Makefile but I can't understand why it doesn't 
work.
Do you have to fill a bug report to bugzilla.kernel.org ?
Ciao,
       Paolo
