ia64 requires more tweaks than just this to work.  This patch as it stands 
isn't expected to work for ia64.
Getting the register states for the note sections is more involved for ia64 
as well as the avoiding of patch collisions with  the diffs in 
/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ia64/v2.5/ 
I have an ia64 patch set thats partially tested for 2.4.17, that seems to 
work.  It didn't get posted as O(1) support became a bigger priority.
I'm hoping to start updating the ia64 patch to support 2.5x very soon.
