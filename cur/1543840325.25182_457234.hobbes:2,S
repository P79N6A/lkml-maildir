In ACPI terms, passive cooling is forced downthrottling of the CPU in 
order to reduce heat generation. This is normally done if the 
temperature is continuing to rise despite active cooling being enabled.
On some hardware you can set the values at which different types of 
cooling will be enabled in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/trip_points. Echo a 
colon separated list of values in there to rewrite them. Some BIOSes 
will change the trip points in response to various events, which will 
then overwrite your values.
