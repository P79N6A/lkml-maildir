Who said you have only one thread-monitor? Fork ten of them if you
care!
I did try it, and results are 10x slowdown for cat doing read from
cache, and only cpu being hogged but no slowdown for cat going from
disk. And if you take a look at janus, you'll see that by masking
which syscalls are interesting and which are not you can get overhead
down to lost_in_noise..10%.
