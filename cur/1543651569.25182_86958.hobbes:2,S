Since 2.5.45 I am not able to boot anymore. If I disable USB the oopses and
panics are gone. I've rebooted a few time but the result is not always the
same. Sometimes it panics in reap_timer_fnc with Aiee, killing interrupt
handler! Or it gives an OOPS at _devfs_search_dir. And I've also seen it
spit out many messages
 "uhci_transfer_result: called for for URB dfc80940 not in flight?"
My machine has a MSI K7T266 Pro motherboard with Athlon 1.3GHz. It has a
VIA chipset, 82C686b+VT8233. Harddisk: IBM Deskstar 60GXP, 40Gb.
I'm using CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD_ALT=y
