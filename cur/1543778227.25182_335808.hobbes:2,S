Looking at the gcc-produced code from youe test program I 
can see the floating point math beeing optimized away all
together as you are not using the result and the rest more
or less boils down to the call to time() and a few moves
and compares of the time values.
In other words it seems like you are testing the efficiency of
the time() function...
