It should just be the MAC address, that's why the kernel side
is coded the way it is.
Where does this sockaddr come from?
I don't see how it could work with the sockaddr there in
2.6.17, as 2.6.17 makes the same exact length check:
		if (ida[IFLA_ADDRESS - 1]->rta_len != RTA_LENGTH(dev->addr_len))
			goto out;
