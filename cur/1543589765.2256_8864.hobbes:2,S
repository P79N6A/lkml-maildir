That was partly meant to be a joke, but it was also meant to make you stop
and think about what you are doing. From what little context I read, you
seem to be looking for a high availability solution. Rebooting a system,
even if there is a hot backup, should only be used as a last resort.
Another problem is that reservations do *not* guarantee ownership over 
the long haul. There are too many mechanisms that break reservations to 
build a complete strategy on them. Unfortunately, this ground was covered
during the 'cluster wars' between IBM and DEC and the field is strewn
with patents, so finding an open source solution may be tough.

Load balancing clusters do need a good locking method, but so do failover
clusters. 
It's been 12 years since I did much with this, but I did do a fine tooth
analysis of parts of DECs clustering code looking for ways it could fail.
(The results were a few internal SPRs. I'm not at liberty to discuss the
details, even if I could remember them. However, I can say without giving
anything away that there were places where a hardware locking mechanism,
like reservation, would have simplified the code and improved performance.)
It was precisely the kinds of things associated with hardware failover
that lead DEC to do clusters in the first place. The load balancing stuff
was secondary, even if it did sell more systems in the long run. You may
be able to get through the patent minefield by retrofitting the load 
balancing lock mechanisms to failover.
It may be that you can make it work, but the tested solution requires
software to back up the hardware. Good Luck, you'll probably need a
lot of it. (no sarcasm intended.)
