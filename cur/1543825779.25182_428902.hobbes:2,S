> Description:
> 
> The sockfd_lookup_light() function does not set the return 
> error status on a particular failure mode when the passed-in 
> fd# is erroneous.
> 
> Environment:
> 
> 2.6.16 kernel with the -mm2 patch-set applied.  Linux 2.6.17 
> kernels are also affected.  Without the fix, a number of 
> tests in LTP fail!  Any program calling one of the syscalls 
> listed below with a bad fd# will not get an error return 
> indicating that the syscall failed.
> 
> Fix:
> 
> The attached patch correctly sets *err = -EBADF if the 
> attempt to map the fd# to a file pointer returns NULL.  The 
> following syscalls are
> affected-
> 
> bind()
> listen()
> accept()
> connect()
> getsockname()
> getpeername()
> setsockopt()
> setsockopt()
> shutdown()
> sendmsg()
