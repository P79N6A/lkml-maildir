     Branch mispredictions might cause spurious fetches. But the
unlikely() should take care of that for the (presumably common)
!__warned case.

And if that's the case they should probably be in amongst write-hot
variables so as to reduce cache-line ping-ponging. __read_mostly should
probably be called __read_hot_write_cold, see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/290
 .

The compiler doesn't, at least not GCC 4. I wouldn't expect it to
hoist loads out of non-loop blocks.

The compiler optimizes out __ret_warn_once; it didn't do that before.
The patch looks good to me, though I am still baffled as to why the
cache misses were occurring.
