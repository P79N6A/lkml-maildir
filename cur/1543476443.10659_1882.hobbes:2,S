I'm not exactly sure what "polling the printer" means, but I assume it
means it's trying to test communication with the printer.  The exact
kernel message is "lp0: using parport0 (polling)."  The code relevant to
that printk is in lp.c.  There are no print jobs in progress when I
reboot, and nothing at all is using the printer driver -- lpd is shutdown
alltogether, and nothing else is accessing it as far as I can tell.
