Hi there,
Since a few days I'm experiencing weird oopses on my iBook/G4 with 
ubuntu's 2.6.22-7-powerpc and also with a vanilla 2.6.22-rc7-git8.
Now for the "weird" part: The oops happens when doing "make install" for 
a piece of software (xine-ui media player) as *root*. No kidding, it 
does NOT happen when I compile the software and do "make install" as a 
normal user. This is 100% reproducible, here're some technical infos 
before I go on describing whe I did:

I've compiled this software earlier, numerous times, always doing 
"make" as a user and "sudo make install" afterwards to install to 
/opt/xine. So when I now tried "make install" as a user I had to chown 
/opt/xine to the user of course.
Even funnier: the dmesg output was captured when I was in 
runlevel 1 - here "make install" (as root) did produce an oops too, but 
the system did NOT panic. I typed "make install" a few times - always an 
oops, but no panic (in runlevel 1).
The netconsole.log captured the panics as well, but the output is kinda 
messy (as always), I'll try to reformat the logfile a bit...
When the Oopses started I checked memory (no memtest86 for ppc, but 
userspace memtest found nothing) and the harddisk (dd'ing from the whole 
disk) and fsck'ed the ext3 - not a single error. Also, all other 
applications are running fine (X11, music, video and stuff),
the system is stable as usual.
I even moved the old target-directory (make install...) out of the way 
and created a new one (new inode, new luck or so) - but to no avail. 
"fsck.ext3 -D" to reindex the directories, still the Oopses just won't 
go away. Searching the net for "Unrecoverable FP Unavailable Exception" 
did not return much :(
Any ideas which magic syscall could cause these oopses?
Thanks,
Christian.
