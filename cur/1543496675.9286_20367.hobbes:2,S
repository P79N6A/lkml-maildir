If your motherboard has a lm78 chip I've got some code that might help
you... (it should also work with lm75) 
It only shows the temperature and voltage, but showing fan speeds
should be easy to add.
The code is an attempt to write a kernel module and it creates a file
in /proc (/proc/lm78) that can be cat'ed
compile w. 
gcc -o procmbmon.o -O -Wall -c -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE procmbmon.c
(This is probably an example of how a module (or anything that runs in
the kernel) shouldn't look like... ;-) )

(If I had found my bookmark for the site where I found the spec I would
have posted that too.... hope you can figure it out from my code...)
