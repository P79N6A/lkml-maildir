I just made a new mount.
(
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/util/util-linux-2.9g.tar.gz
)
Changes: (1) locking redone, (2) "proto" and "vers" options in nfsmount,
 (3) filesystems mounted by some user (via the "user" keyword in fstab)
     can only be unmounted by the same user. The old behaviour that
     allows any user to unmount what you just mounted is still available
     under the "users" keyword
 (4) /etc/filesystems, if it exists, determines probing order, so that
     (a) you can specify that vfat must be tried before msdos, and
     (b) auto mounting can try filesystem types available as module
     but not currently in /proc/filesystems
 (5) other minor things
As usual, all this has had all of zero seconds testing.
