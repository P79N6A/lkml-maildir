OK, sorry; pardon me!  Then the right question to ask is more like
"So does this still happen in **2.6.14-rc2** ??".  2.6.13-rc is
marginally more recent than 2.4.20, but it still feels old. :)
My other point still stands though.  The IRQ for all HCDs _are_ freed
on suspend, and re-requested on resume ... so lack of such free/request
calls can't possibly be an issue.
The old rule of thumb with USB does still apply though:  be sure to
test with BIOS support for it disabled.
