Don't try it, the perversity of MIPS will break you :)
Just to clarify something that I saw getting lost in this discussion:
Oprofile doesn't need to become built as a 64-bit binary, just
configured to accept 64-bit kernels.  So this doesn't rule out using a
32-bit oprofile (i.e. not needing a 64-bit libc) on a 64-bit kernel. 
It just means that we need to specify it somehow.
John, speaking of MIPS perversity: MIPS64 kernels can come in ELF32
files.  So you may just want to make this a configure-time option.
