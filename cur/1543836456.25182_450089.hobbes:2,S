Yes.

Because

Kernel memory is in general not swappable.

Userspace will start to be swapped out to make room for kernel memory.
And if the swap is full, the OOM killer comes into action and will kill 
programs.
That's why it is so important to make sure that there are no memory leaks 
in kernelspace.
