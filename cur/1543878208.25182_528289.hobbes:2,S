Linux hangs when powernow-k8 attempts to change the clock speed. Happens
on 2.6.21-rc6, -rc5 and (at least) back to 2.6.18. The hang occurs before
loading X and so is in text mode. alt+sysrq+z/b/etc doesn't work, nor
does the NMI watchdog despite its being loaded ("Testing NMI watchdog ...
OK."). However, the hangcheck option *does* work (reboots it a few
seconds after it hangs). Another interesting point is that this
motherboard (asus M2V, via K8T890 based) worked until yesterday with a
different CPU. But since hangcheck works, the CPU must still be active.
I have been through the relevant BIOS settings, and googled extensively.
Any hints as to how to debug this further, or whether it is likely to be
worthwhile to do so?
