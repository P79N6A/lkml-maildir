It's pretty sad that we add this extra code into ext3_prepare_write() -
it's almost never actually executed.
I wonder how important this optimisation really is?  I bet no applications
are using posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_RANDOM) anyway.
It we really see that benefits are available from this approach we probably
need to bite the bullet and add file_operations.fadvise()
