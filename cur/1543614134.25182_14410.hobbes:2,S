The loop counter you're outputting is the 2nd byte of the loop counter,
which really isn't interesting; what probably makes more sense to output
is the value of %dx in your code.
I would like to suggest making the following changes and try them out:
a) Change A20_TEST_LOOPS to something like 32768 in the new kernel code.
b) Add a "call delay" between the movw and the cmpw in your old_loop
   and see if it suddenly breaks;
c) Check what your %dx value is (if it's nonzero, there might be an
   issue.)
d) Once again, please complain to your motherboard/BIOS vendor and tell
   them to implement int 15h, ax=2401h.
e) Add a strictly serializing instruction sequence, such as:
	pushw %dx
	smsw %dx
	lmsw %dx
	popw %dx		
   ... where the "call delay" call is in a20_test.
	-hpa
