Hi.
I can answer a couple of the questions:

It should contain the .S equivalent to the swsusp2.c file. It would be
best if swsusp2.c could simply be compiled, but it appears that it can't
at the moment on x86 (I need to learn x86 assembly so I can understand
why).

That idea is to have a section that doesn't get replaced when we copy
the original kernel back. Thus, small amounts of data that suspend uses
or stores can be given the __nosave attribute. An example is the cpu
frequency value, which should match the boot kernel, not the value at
suspend time.

Nigel
