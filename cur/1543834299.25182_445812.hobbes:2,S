I checked the FAQ but didn't see an answer to this.  Over the past few weeks I've submitted probably around 8 simple typo-fix patches all of which seemed to be approved by others on the list.  I've been following the GIT, but these patches haven't been merged yet.  I know people are busy with other things, probably more important, but I would like to know how long is "acceptable" to wait before I should re-submit a patch.  Obviously if enough time passes, patches start to break as source files change.  I don't mean to be a nuisance; I'm just trying to determine proper protocol.  That and the fact I can submit several more patches once I get some of these old ones out of my queue. :)
