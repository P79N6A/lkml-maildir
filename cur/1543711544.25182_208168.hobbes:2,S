In the 2.6 kernels internal timing and task statistics (for i386 
systems) are now kept in milliseconds where they were previously in 
1/100ths of a second.  By converting these statistics to 1/100ths of a 
second for export to user space an order of magnitude (i.e. a factor of 
10) loss of precision occurs.

PS I'd like to point out that there are changes in 2.6 kernels that have 
more serious consequences than this that have to be coped with when 
using 2.6 kernels on distributions such as RedHat 9 that were built 
around older kernels.
