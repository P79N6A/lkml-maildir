I think what makes this patch look superfluous is that Chris added a set
of wrappers for dnotify, too.
In the inotify patch, the fsnotify wrappers call directly into the
inotify and dnotify interfaces and they do consolidate code and clean
things up.  I added fsnotify at hch's request.
Now that audit is coming along, fsnotify makes even more sense.
I would like to share some more code at a lower level, though, as you
pointed out.
I planned to look at redoing dnotify entirely on top of inotify, once
inotify is in the kernel proper, for example.
