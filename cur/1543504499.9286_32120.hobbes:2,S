And there are many people who believe that a couple of percent slowdown
in the normal case to make this work better is worth it. Unfortunately, 
"this" changes and the percents add up. 
Some of this is pure cost shifting. I get this all the time for the RT
kernel -- "you must add feature X so we don't have to rewrite our code
that runs like the tranquilized fossil of a giant ground sloth 
on Chorus/Solaris/... ."  It's hard to strike the correct balance between
making the OS useful and subsidizing other peoples bad legacy software.
