No objections. Please generate against "devel" branch on my -git, since
I did a patch fixing most CodingStyle issues reported by checkpatch.pl.
Several files under /media still uses the old convention of having such
things at the end of the file.

I'm afraid that this wouldn't avoid this bug, however. 
The removal of the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL seemed to be the intention of
Brandon, since he renamed the function, removing the locks. I think he
didn't noticed that videobuf_dvb were using videobuf_read_start. The
patch I've just send fixes it properly.
Btw, Shane patch reveals a small trouble with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL: adding
the tag for a non-existing function didn't rise any error. IMO, it
should generate some compilation error, if you try to export a symbol
that doesn't exist at the file that is being compiled.
Cheers,
Mauro
