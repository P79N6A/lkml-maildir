Hi,
Under Linux 2.2.x I used to be able to use ipchains to send packet to a
netlink socket so that my userspace application could further analyze
the packet data.
Since kernel 2.4 and iptables, I have not enjoyed the same functionality,
has it been deprecated in favour of a better method, if so, what? I ask 
because I just spent my last few hours writing an iptables plugin, and 
netfilter target kernel module, in order to replace the old functionality 
exactly, to the end that my application works with zero modifications.
Have I missed something?
Kind regards
