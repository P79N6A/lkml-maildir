I have only a AGP 2 (geforce 4-mx) card, so I missed that(and with one I would 
only to be able to say 'it doesn't work' so thanks for your explanation). But 
without this changes I won't even able to use dga, because the first 
dga-enabled app completely locks up my box. 
And to have working AGP2 and non working APG3 looks a lot better for me than 
no AGP-support at all.  
2.5.* is able to 'mostly' boot on my mobo so I can't say anything about that..
Glück Auf,
Volker
