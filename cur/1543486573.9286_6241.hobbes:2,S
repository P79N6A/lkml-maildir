	thanks to all people that answered my questions....effectively
what i was missing is the Extended dumb serial support...i compiled a
kernel with this and the modem is working very well, seems i can switch
now to the 2.2.x series :) but i got a question now: in the pnp's driver
it says that it will be include in the kernel very soon, i downloaded to
try it with 2.0.35 and i saw many archives, and in the 2.2.x kernels in
the pnp directory there's just one, when will this driver be included in
the 2.2.x series ???? i haven't tried it yet but if it works why haven't
been include yet ???
	Thanks for your answers.....
	Greetings...
