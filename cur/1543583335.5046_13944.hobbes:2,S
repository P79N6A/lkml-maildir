Subject: Writing on raw device with software RAID 0 is slow

Hello,
Writing to an software RAID 0 containing 4 SCSI discs is very fast.
I get transfer rates of about 100 MBytes/s. The filesystem on the RAID
is ext2.
Writing to the same RAID directly (that means on the raw device without
a filesystem) works
but gives low transfer rates of about 31 MBytes/s.
Any explanation for that?
thanks and greetings,
Martin Rauh
