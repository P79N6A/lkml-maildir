No luck,
Funny thing is there is nothing in dmesg or even /var/log/messages for
a matter of fact, nor does it kick into sysrq console.
if i ping flood to a ip local on the network from the box giving the
problem, it does not hang.
if i copy something from the box giving the problem onto another pc,
BANG at around 30Mb (varying up to 60Mb) it bombs.
hang is such that nothing can be run, numlock. .. work fine. can't
execute any proggies or anything.
very weird.
I tried the patch to no avail, if i enable debugging the problem does
not occur (so it must be extreme load related).
as I said 2.4.x works fine with hyperthreading, 2.6.x bombs. seeing as
there isn't very much extreme driver change (and seeing as none should
be required) i suspect the problem is deeper.
