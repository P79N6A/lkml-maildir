I just got a Dane-Elec PhotoMate Combo SmartMedia/CompactFlash reader
manufactured by SCM Microsystems. It is a USB device with ID 04e6:0005.
The 
http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/
 list of supported devices
calls this thing unsupported, and mailhot@enst.fr writes:
"I want this to work ! I'll help testing."
I think the status can be changed to fully supported, at least
it works fine in my first tests.
Changes required:
(i) in sd.c there is a peculiar code fragment that assumes
that a removable disk is write protected in case the status is unknown;
reversing this default allows writing to the flash card.
                if (the_result) {
-                       printk("%s: test WP failed, assume Write Protected\n", nbuff);
-                       rscsi_disks[i].write_prot = 1;
+                       printk("%s: test WP failed, assume Write Enabled\n", nbuff);
                } else {
                        rscsi_disks[i].write_prot = ((buffer[2] & 0x80) != 0);
(ii) this card needs usb/storage/dpcm.c which is compiled when
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DPCM is set, but this variable is missing
from usb/Config.in. Add it.
(iii) add to unusual_devs.h:
diff -u --recursive --new-file ../linux-2.4.3/linux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h ./l\
inux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h

Maybe the device is slow, and I got read errors with a Compact Flash
card in the reader at boot time. A "blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdX" worked.
