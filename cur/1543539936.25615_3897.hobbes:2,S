It consists of all released kernels that are still available. This
means that it is complete since kernel 0.0.14 was released, but there
are quite a few missing kernels prior to that.

The online index is at...
	
http://www.memalpha.cx/Linux/Kernel
...but this only has links for kernels that are currently available
online, although it includes details of the kernels not currently
available online which I have obtained or been able to recreate.
Incidentally, following on from my recent protracted absence from the
surfboard, I've now brought this index up to date...
 > I think he offers it on CDR as well.
I do indeed offer it on CDR - it currently runs to four CD-R's for the
entire collection.

I have to admit that my collection hasn't been cvs'd but is available
as the raw tarballs.
