Heh, I should have CC'd you on this complaint ;-)
Yeah, this is a new warning and since we do a lot of these types of
indentation, and they are marked as "ERROR", I would like to see these go 
away. Perhaps they need to test for parenthesis, so:
 int func(foo		*bar)
gets caught.
[off topic, funny English grammar]
I noticed that you said:
   And it seems to warn about such statements since very recently
This sounds strange. I know in German (and I know you are not German, but 
it's what I have most experience with) the word "seit" gets translated 
into "since" for such statements as above. A lot of Germans that I know 
make this funny sounding phrase. I would have written it like:
   And, recently, it seems to warn about such statements.
Don't take this as a criticism. I'm the last person to criticize anyone's 
grammar. For being an English speaking native, my grammar sucks ;-)
And your statement may indeed be correct grammar. It just sounds a little
funny to me.
In a lot of cases, (for Germans) "seit" can correctly be translated into
"since" but there are times that it just sounds funny.
A common phrase from Germans are:
  I've been doing this since three years.
Just an observation, carry on ;-)
