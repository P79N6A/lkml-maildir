OIC.  Brrr.  That _definitely_ needs commenting - as has been demonstrated.
SLOB is using the theoretically one-shot initiator to do garbage collection.
The:
			if (size == PAGE_SIZE) /* trying to shrink arena? */
				return 0;
In slob_alloc() definitely looks very dodgy, now that I see it.  What happens
if some normal user asks to allocate exactly a page?  Oh... I suppose it never
gets into slob_alloc() to allocate the main piece of storage.
