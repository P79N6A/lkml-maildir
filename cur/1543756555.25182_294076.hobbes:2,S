Go for it, if it becomes a problem we'll rate limit it.  Our first
concern is that the BK users can get at the trees so if you are eating up
the bandwidth too much we'll slow down the web interface.

That's fine, they can do that.  Get the patches and figure out how to
put them back together.  These people do know how to use patch, right?
OK, then they are welcome to patch things in, when they don't work, find
a place they do work and create a branch, patch them, repeat.  Haven't
they ever dealt with a patch reject before?  It's not that hard.

I'm not denying anyone that.  The history consists of the diffs and the
checkin comments, you have that.

_They_ didn't produce the branching structure, BitKeeper did that.
Go look, there isn't a way to type a command which produces a branch in
BK.  So claiming that metadata is property of the developers is nonsense,
they didn't produce, it isn't physically possible for them to produce it.
That's part of BK's design and power.  100% of what any developer
produced is already available on the web, in the form that has been
used for more than 10 years as the preferred form, a unified diff.
And we added comments because those are useful and you typed them in.
You guys have been importing patches for more than a decade, since when
did that become a problem?

That's fine if they want to do that, they have the patches.  What they
don't get is the tree structure that BK has because that gives them the
ability to go back and forth and say "well, BK did it this way and it
worked, why doesn't it work in our system?".

Indeed.  I don't suppose there is any chance you could get people to go
play with the gcc tree?

I think you are fishing for BK internal information and I'm not going
to bite.  The bottom line is that we laid out some rules, the BK users
agreed to them, that's the deal.  If you don't like the deal then go
build an alternative.  You can use all the patches you want from BK but
you don't get to use BK's metadata.
