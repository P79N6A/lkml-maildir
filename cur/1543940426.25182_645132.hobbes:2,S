Yes, that's right.  The changes to make it work were a fair bit more 
complex than your's.

I solved that with some linker magic.  One of the things I did was get 
rid of tools/build and did everything in the linker.  And I worked out a 
trick where you can get the setup code to refer to vmlinux's symbols 
without actually linking it in (no, wait, was that to solve something 
else?).
In the xenbits repo, you can see a series of patches guarded with 
+pvboot, which was my patchset when I last worked on it. 
i386-cleanup-image-generation.patch is particularly interesting (though 
it could definitely do with being broken into smaller patches).  
(xen-paravirt-boot.patch was fun to get going too, though I don't think 
it will be useful overall.)
