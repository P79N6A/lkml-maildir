Subject: [BENCHMARK] Corrected gcc3.2 v gcc2.95.3 contest results

One of those 2.96 compilers snuck in (my poor use of autocomplete). I take back
all the previous data and submit accurate ones, and apologise profusely for
ruining the signal to noise ratio on this list
To rehash what the last results were _supposed_ to be and what these are. I have
identical config 2.5.38 kernels compiled with either gcc2.95.3 or gcc3.2. Then I
run these two kernels through a contest benchmark (
http://contest.kolivas.net
)
using ONLY gcc2.95.3 to run the benchmark.
Kernel                  Time            CPU
NoLoad:
2.5.38                  68.25           99%
2.5.38-gcc32            67.28           99%
Process Load:
2.5.38                  71.60           95%
2.5.38-gcc32            70.86           94%
IO Half Load:
2.5.38                  81.26           90%
2.5.38-gcc32            88.11           82%
IO Full Load:
2.5.38                  170.21          42%
2.5.38-gcc32            230.77          30%
Mem Load:
2.5.38                  104.22          70%
2.5.38-gcc32            104.97          70%
This time only the IO loads showed a statistically significant difference.
Terribly sorry about that previous mess
