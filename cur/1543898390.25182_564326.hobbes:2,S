Just to be more specific, my to-review inbox contains:
Alan: pata_sis FIFO whack, pata_dma option
Tejun: PMP patchbomb
Albert: irq_on/off restructure, irq-driven PIO to wq, minor PIO fixes
Kristen: ALPM
Mikael: sata_promise cleanup and hotplug
via akpm: HPA cleanup, cancel-rearming-wq cleanup
A few one-liner patches from Florian A, Boaz H, Christian L, Sonic Z, 
Jose A R.
NOTE to Kristen:  I am OK with your SATA async notification patches, as 
stated a while ago, but I think Andrew Morton had a better plan for 
merging that, so it's not in my queue.
Anything not on this list should be resent, I don't have it.
	Jeff
