I'm not even certain we need the read flush in the enable.
However having it in there makes the code easier to reason
about.  Which is a big plus.
Generally if the interrupt controller hardware is sane 
mask/unmask and enable/disable should be the same function.
If we need to work around something in the hardware enable/disable
should do that and mask/unmask should poke the hardware.
Since MSI is specified as properly handle pending interrupts
I would put the write flush in mask.  It makes the code easier
to understand and comprehend.
The practical question in my book is do we set the enable/disable
methods to the same functions as the mask/unmask methods or
do we let them default to the crazy delayed disable scenario.
Given that we do have a tiny race where we need to ensure the
MSI is disabled before we unregister it, we don't know of any
MSI implementation problems that will result in a screaming IRQ.
I would say set enable/disable to the mask/unmask methods.
This will fix the tiny freeing bug mentioned above, and not play
games with drivers that are using MSI irqs.
If at some point we need a lesser form someone can change the msi
enable/disable methods to something else.
