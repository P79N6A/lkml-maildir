OK, if that 91 is OK, then no problem, I was thinking the minimum would be 
around 1-2 KB (now that I think about it, not really sure why I assumed 
that).  I'm not mad enough to require/want shrinking from 90 to 45 
bytes :) especially since most useful programs have a little more meat to 
them than the 80 bytes worth of header :)
