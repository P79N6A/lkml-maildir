This code, either way, is all about trying to keep compatibility with
2.2.  You know some instances which are broken by the current code,
Alan knows some instances which would be broken by your code.

So fix your installer to work with either, isn't that what really
needs to be done?  However you play with 2.4's sysinfo, your current
2.2 installer will give wrong results on some RAM sizes, won't it?

I think this one is correct (and much clearer than what's currently
there).  But whether it should be applied is for Alan to decide...
