My controller is busmaster:
00:0b.0 SCSI storage controller: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c875
(rev 04)
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 80, IRQ 15
        I/O ports at d400
        Memory at dd800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        Memory at dd000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
But problems are still there...
