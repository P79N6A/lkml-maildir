But not all data. That's the point. The bk2cvs process is lossy...you 
can't gloss over that point.

No...I keep wanting free (speech) access to all (current and historical 
information) that is part of the kernel. You ignored the question of who 
owns the changesets. Or maybe, more appropriately, what license do the 
changesets have?

Is there some implication here that is a license violation for a bk 
(free license) user to make available full changesets for non-bk users 
to user for *any* purpose?
