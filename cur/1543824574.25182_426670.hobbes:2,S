I think this is the wrong approach.
Many of these should probably be converted to seq_file, but in the
particular case of environ, the right approach is to observe the fact
that reading environ is just like reading /proc/PID/mem, except:
 a. the access restrictions are less strict, and
 b. there is a range restriction, which needs to be enforced, and
 c. there is an offset.
Pretty much, take the guts from /proc/PID/mem and generalize it
slightly, and you have the code that can run either /proc/PID/mem or
/proc/PID/environ.
