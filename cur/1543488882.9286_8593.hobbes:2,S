Another report about matroxfb:
I use matroxfb (dual headed but only 1 monitor attached to a matrox
mystique 220 ... the second card is a mystique 170).
I use X86_FBDev.
I use an MSS sound card.
When starting X FBDev server _while_ sound card is playing sounds crash my
machine ... solid lockup ...
Sometimes the machine crash when exiting X FBDev too but here I can SAK
and then ... problems over problems ... one time I have seen SCSI timeouts
... another time I have seen GPF's another time I have seen _nothing_ ...
another more time I have seen nothing (screen blank) ...
I would really like to help debugging this crashes (I ever thought that X
FBDev+kernel fb is _much_ more kernel-friendly than the X SVGA ... leading
to less kernel problems [read crashes] due to the lack of direct-io).
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
