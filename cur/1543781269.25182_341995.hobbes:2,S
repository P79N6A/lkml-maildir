i'm still seeing weird crashes under SMP, which go away if i disable 
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS. (this after i fixed a couple of other SMP bugs 
in the HRT code) It happens sometime during the bootup, after enabling 
the network but before users can log in. There's no good debug info, 
just a hang that comes from all CPUs trying to get some debug info out 
but crashing deeply.
