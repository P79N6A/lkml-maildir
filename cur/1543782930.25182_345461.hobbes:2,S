Subject: [PATCH] cpm_uart: Fix baseaddress for SMC 1 and 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/30/16

Base addess register for SMC 1 and 2 are never initialized.
This means that they will not work unless a bootloader already
configured them.
The DPRAM already have space reserved, this patch just makes sure
the base addess register is updated correctly on initialization.
