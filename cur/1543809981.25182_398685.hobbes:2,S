Sorry, that my non-true statement was due to the less-than-perfect 
description of the patch. After patching, this produces a horizontal line:
echo -e '\x0eqqqq\x0f'
So please correct the description and the first (comment) hunk of the 
patch, so that it doesn't mention "smacs" and similar words with meaning 
that may vary, and so that it mentions the exact control codes.
