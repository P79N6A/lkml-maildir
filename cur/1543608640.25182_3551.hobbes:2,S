The following mistakes occur during a kernel installation:
kernel22 ##################################################
look like there was a problem, the default vmlinuz version is not
the same of the initrd
kernel22-secure ##################################################
look like there was a problem, the default vmlinuz version is not
the same of the initrd
What is the solution?
