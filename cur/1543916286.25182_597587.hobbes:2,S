This still frightens the hell out of me. Going through 15 states and
failing. Seems the CPU is holding off writes for a long long time. That
means we flipped the counter 4 times, and that still wasn't good enough?
Maybe I'll boot up my powerbook to see if it has the same issues.
Well, I'm still finishing up on moving into my new house, so I wont be
available this weekend.
Thanks,
