kbuild-2.5 - scsi stuff
This stuff has grown by running script_asm.pl. It's free for
debate whether it's useful.
You shouldn't need this patch to build with kbuild-2.5.
If you have these scsi controllers, it might be useful to have.
There seems no point in patching this into the kernel without
applying the rest of kbuild-2.5.
