Ultimately, that's Linus, often with some input from the rest of
the community.  Look, it's very simple.  Create patches, submit for
public review, update according to feedback, resubmit, etc.  The main
problem here is the patches above are invasive and considering where
we are in the 2.6 series (read: concerned utmost about stability) large
invasive patches aren't appropriate.  Further, there's an infrastructure
designed to support some of the features in the above patchsets, LSM.
And the idle complaints that it's inadequate without engaging in dialog
or supplying patches don't work very far towards a solution.
thanks,
