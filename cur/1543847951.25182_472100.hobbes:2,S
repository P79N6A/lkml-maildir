I'm more inclined to define RSS as "how much ram does my application
cause to be used".  To monitor process's working set size, We already
have /proc/<pid>/smaps.  Whether we can use working set size in an
intelligent way in mm is an interesting question. Though, so far such
accounting is not utilized at all.
