In theory; in practice we have no access to documentation.  See above...
That makes Transmeta part of the _old_ industry :)
I believe present Transmeta CPUs are quite specialised for x86
behaviour (memory model etc.) anyway.  When you're running on a CPU
like that, there's probably little to be gained from changing to a
different front-end instruction set.
Special tricks like non-cache-ping-ponging locks and faster interrupt
handling might improve performance, but probably require a change of
the hardware to implement.
