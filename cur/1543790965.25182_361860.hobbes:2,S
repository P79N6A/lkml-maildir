Well, the problem probably started before then.

Speaking as a programmer, that's not a lot to go off of to find the
bug. I think everyone would agree it's a bug, but we'll need more help
from you.

Does hdparm -i (or -I) show differences between the 2.4 kernels and
2.6? 2.6 has new IDE drivers, and so perhaps your system isn't using
the best driver any more.
You may also want to compare lspci -vv of your IDE controller and
sound card between 2.4 and 2.6, and see if there are any differences.
No guarantees, but this is where you'd start.

Try that. If nothing obvious appears in the examination, you may want
to try the 2.6.14-rt1 patchset from Ingo Molnar. It's designed to
reduce latency in the kernel, but also has a latency tracer that may
be particularly useful for your problem. (Assuming it's a latency
issue, and not a hardware misconfiguration due to 2.6 doing something
wrong.)
