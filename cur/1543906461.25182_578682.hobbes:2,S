Implementing policies on an object level introduces significant allocator 
overhead. Tried to do it in SLAB which created a mess.
Add a (slow) kmalloc_policy? Strict Object round robin for interleave 
right? It probably needs its own RR counter otherwise it disturbs the per 
task page RR.
For interleave kmalloc() does allocate the slabs round robin not the 
objects.
