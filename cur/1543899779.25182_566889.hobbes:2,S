I have to maintain it because I have to keep the slab APIs consistent 
(recently I added GFP_ZERO support and had to provide shims for slab 
defreag). It is not in a good state as described in the patch and has a 
history of not being maintained properly. Everyone that modifies the 
behavior of the slab allocator has to do something to avoid breaking SLOB. 
Its certainly fun to hack on but is that a criterion for keeping it in the 
tree?

Quickly? We have considered this for months now.
