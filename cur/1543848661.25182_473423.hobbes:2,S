With the original code, the number of callbacks you see for IDLE_START and
IDLE_STOP is not too obvious.
On an idle system Opteron 250 with HZ=250, one would expect to see for a 10s duration:
	- for CPU0      : IDLE_START = IDLE_STOP = about 5000 calls
	- for other CPUs: IDLE_START = IDLE_STOP = about 2500  calls
With the original code, you get the following number of calls:
CPU0.IDLE_START = 44 (enter_idle)
CPU0.IDLE_STOP  = 5206 (exit_idle)
CPU1.IDLE_START = 27 (enter_idle)
CPU1.IDLE_STOP  = 2528 (exit_idle)
Now, of course, you may get "batched" interrupts where you do not return to idle
before you process the next interrupt. But the difference seems quite high here.
Do you have an explanation for this?
