There is no guarantee as to when the workqueue will process the request
as far as I know. The actual delay probably depends on the value of HZ.
There is no way around the delay in the case of I2C RTC chips anyway
(at least not with the current implementation), as the underlying I2C
bus driver may sleep as part of the bus transaction, and the RTC chip
driver can virtually be attached to every bus.
Note that the transaction itself will take some time anyway, I2C can be
quite slow.
