It's me.  Turns out sparc, avr32 and arm all don't define __fls in their
asm/bitops.h, and I'm the first one to use it in generic code.
But as I prepared this patch, I note that the armv5 __fls/fls is wrong:
  /* Implement fls() in C so that 64-bit args are suitably truncated */
  static inline int fls(int x)
  {
      return __fls(x);
  }
__fls(x) returns a bit number (0-31).  fls() returns 0 or bitnumber+1.
(Yes, classic useless kerneldoc documentation doesn't actually *say* 
this clearly).
But here's the linux-next fix:
arm: define __fls for pre v5 ARM
