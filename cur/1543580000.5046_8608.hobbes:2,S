While on the subject of devfs:
  - it doesn't seem to have any entries for raw devices:
    /dev/rawctl, /dev/raw/raw1, etc
  - when I upgraded to glibc 2.2 (via a rpm) in RH 7.0
    this line in /etc/devfsd.conf caused devfsd to 
    seg fault:
    "LOOKUP      ^cdrom$      CFUNCTION      GLOBAL     
         symlink ${mntpnt}/cdroms/cdrom0 $devpath"
    Rebuilding devfsd didn't help.
