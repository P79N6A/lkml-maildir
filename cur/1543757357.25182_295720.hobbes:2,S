Here are some numbers with my setup. I always wrote 1 GB of data to the
same DVD-RAM disc (EMTEC), to the device directly and to a fresh ext2
on
the disc.
kernel 2.6.10:
$ time { sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=64k count=16000 ; sync ; }
real    32m5.025s
$ time {sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/cdrom bs=64k count=16000 ; sync ;}
real    29m41.980s
kernel 2.6.7:
$ time { sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=64k count=16000 ; sync ; }
real    13m23.688s
$ time {sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/cdrom bs=64k count=16000 ; sync ;}
real    13m14.609s
