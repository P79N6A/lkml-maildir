convincing by simplicity, oversimplification also may have drawbacks.

yes. Smartdata and everything would be correct, except for the disk
contents.

contradicts previous paragraph? Still wrong smartdata etc unless
you mean to set the flag per request depending on the type of command
- which would be quite easy afaics.

so to sum up, your idea is 
- cleanup and correct current solution for IDE_BYTESWAPPED_HWIF machines
- make all others use the loop layer
looks fine.
