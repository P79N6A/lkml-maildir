How about IBM. According to the datasheet at
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/desk/ds120gxp.htm
Deskstar 120GXP with 120GB capacity has 24125472 sectors (123522416640
bytes).
That is 123.5GB if G=10^9 but 120.6GB if G=10^6*2^10 (and merely 115.0GB 
if G=2^30).
Horrible? Yes.
(The same is true for 40GB and 80GB versions of 120GXP, and my (older model)
30GB and 40GB IBM drives.)

So Maxtor lies 7.37% while IBM lies only 4.86%?
BTW does anybody else remember when this insanity started? I seem to remember
that in the begining of the 90's some manufacturers re-defined (binary) MB as
1000kB and others had to follow (most likely because stupid buyers usually
bought the drive with 2.4% bigger figure without realizing it was the same
size as the other.)
