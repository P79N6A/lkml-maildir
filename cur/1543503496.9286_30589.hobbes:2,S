I do not understand...
a) where all these strange idea on /etc/hosts come out? I can not
imagine a system that needs to reboot just to add an entry to one of
its databases. /etc/hosts is read anytime you use it: 
(0)pern:~/tmp% strace telnet goofy |& grep open  | grep host
open("/etc/host.conf", O_RDONLY)        = 3
open("/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY)            = 3
b) in which way is this related to kernel development?
