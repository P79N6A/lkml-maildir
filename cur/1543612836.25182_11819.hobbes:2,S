It patched 2.5.1-pre8 cleanly, except for a makefile.  I'm running
2.5.1-pre8 with this patch right now.

Just 'gzip -9 vmlinux'  Grub will uncompress it for you.
This actually makes for a smaller file than bzImage (on
my machine, anyway).  
Are the unused sections taking up space at runtime?

It's a cool hack!  I like grub's module loading mechanism
better than the initrd solution.
Unfortunately, grub doesn't run on all supported platforms.
And the multiboot specification isn't an accepted standard.
(grub docs just read like it is.....)
