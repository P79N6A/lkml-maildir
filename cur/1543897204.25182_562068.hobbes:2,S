Mostly harmless indeed.  I don't understand why you insist on trying
to complicate the situation.  flush_dcache_page is only expected to
do something on pages mapped into userspace (correct me if I'm wrong
there), it's expected to do nothing on kmalloc'ed pages.  It's
been working that way for years, and will continue to work that way
with slub, providing either page_mapping or flush_dcache_page checks
PageSlab to avoid oopsing on page->mapping.
2.6.22-rc6 has page_mapping making that check: we could argue about
which is the better site for it, there are good arguments both ways
(page_mapping is the correct place, flush_dcache_page is the more
efficient place), I suggest we leave it as is.

Why????  All we require of flush_dcache_page is that it not oops on
the first page in the range: we don't need to change over to
flush_dcache_range for that.

We have the PageSlab check in page_mapping now,
I don't see what further change is needed.
