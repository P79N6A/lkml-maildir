Agree.  We need to disable it, since folks do not read the docs
(obviously).  Of course, we could leave it on, and I could start
charging money for these tools -- there's little doubt it would be a
lucrative business.  Perhaps this is what I'll do if the numbers of
copies keeps growing.  When it hits > 100 per week, it's taking a lot of
our time to support, so I will have to start charging for it.
