Hello All,
First off, I'd like to say a big 'thank you!!!!' to all the people here, I 
was very amazed at the quickness the support for the chipset was integrated 
into the maintream kernel.
I've been testing the latest kernels a bit, and I've found out that when 
using the pre12 kernel, I once again get:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Unsupported AMD chipset (device id: 700e), you might want to try 
agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
where as with the pre11 kernel it was:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Detected AMD 761 chipset
I've not had the time to crosscheck what actually changed with -pre12, but 
could it be the patch got lost somewhere?
Thanks,
DevilKin
