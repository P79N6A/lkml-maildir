How about something as simple as: if process sleeps, and AS scheduler
is waiting since last request from that process, AS scheduler stops
waiting immediately?
In other words, a hook in the process scheduler when a process goes to
sleep, to tell the AS scheduler to stop waiting.
Although this would not always be optimal, for many cases the point of
AS is that the process is continuing to run, not sleeping, and will
issue another request shortly.
