It seems you copied enough of it.

This is what happens:
ioumap calls ioremap_change_attr with vmlist_lock held. change_page_attr_addr
then tries to acquire init_mm.mmap_sem, which must not be taken with
spinlock held.
It looks like the incorrect code has been in there for quite some time, but 
that path was not taken for some reason.
