Hi!
the problem is a bad configuration of the BIOS, you
have to configure your BIOS so your cpu can have full
power when pluged in.
The toshiba laptops have some parameters for the cpu
and the screen, so you can save some power when
running on batteries.
You can access the BIOS by pressing the esc key when
booting or use the rescue/maintenance disk provided
bye toshiba
