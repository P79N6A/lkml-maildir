But it doesn't check for a recently used PID. Lets say your system is
exhausting 1000 PIDs/second, and that there is a window of 20ms between you
determining which PID to send to, and the recipient process receiving it.
With truely random PIDs, there is now a chance of 1-(1-1/32000)^20 that a
new process will have the PID of the process you intended your signal for.
That's 0.06%, but historically, we care for those kind of chances.
The complete formula is: 1-(1-1/32000)^(dt*pps), where dt stands for the
time interval and pps for the number of pids created per second.
Currently, there are problems if your dt*pps product is bigger than 32000,
which in practice won't ever happen.
