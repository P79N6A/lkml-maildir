Yes. NetRAIN (Tru64 Unix) for instance has a daemon in user space that
monitor the device input & output statistics and try to generate some
traffic (e.g. by pinging some multicast groups) in case rx & tx packet counts
are not increased in some period of time. Then a switch is initiated if they
remain stable. But some failure conditions with some cards can be detected at
driver level (e.g. Ethernet link down).

The device could give the Ethernet link down indication. But most failures
would be detected at user-space level with the lack of rx/tx packets in 
some period of time. Such a feature would not only allow to have a working
redundant NIC but would also allow to have a fully redundant ethernet
connection (i.e. two Ethernet NIC could be connected to different switches 
in the same IP network), in case of failure of one NIC or switch, the other
route would be used by switching the NIC.
