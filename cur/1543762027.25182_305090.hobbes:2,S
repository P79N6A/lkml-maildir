I think a better way is:
   Providing a different connector channel called the administrator 
   channel which can be used only by a super-user, and gives you
   the ability to switch on or off any connector channel including the
   fork-connector channel.
   For lack of better term I am using the word 'channel' to mean
   something that carries events of particular type through the
   connector-infrastructure.
