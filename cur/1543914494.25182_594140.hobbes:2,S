Since most network devices have a single status register for both
receiver and transmit (and errors and the like), which needs a lock to
protect access, you will likely end up with serious thrashing of moving
the lock between cpus.

Since most network devices have a single status register for both
receiver and transmit (and errors and the like), which needs a lock to
protect access, you will likely end up with serious thrashing of moving
the lock between cpus.
