I second that question...

Hm, I've thought that config selections were either boolean or
tristate.  This makes it sound like they could be quadstate (y/n/m/blank).
And the menu dependency doc in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
makes it sound (to me) like undefined values become 'n':
<quote>
Expressions are listed in decreasing order of precedence. 
(1) Convert the symbol into an expression. Boolean and tristate symbols
    are simply converted into the respective expression values. All
    other symbol types result in 'n'.
...
An expression can have a value of 'n', 'm' or 'y' (or 0, 1, 2
respectively for calculations). A menu entry becomes visible when it's
expression evaluates to 'm' or 'y'.
