It confuses them "right way".
Old security scripts program has root privileges. It is wrong, it has
only subset. But it is wrong _the right way_. Old scripts still see
the "bad scenario".
About massive security holes: I don't agree. With this solution, what
would I do? Took sendmail, and few other, normally suid 0 programs,
and lowered their privileges. With new kernels, I would have better
protection, and with old kernels, I would have current situation.
It is no-loose situation.
