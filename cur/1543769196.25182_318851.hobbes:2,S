Yes, tried, fixes ;-)
However I suggest that a pointer to user documentation for ALSA be added
to the Help.
For example I have a problem when I run XMMS, Skype says something like
"can't open /dev/dsp" and don't know where to start.  The only thing I
know is that 1) I have ALSA turned on and 2) I want to know how to make
it accept more data streams from the programs and mix them together.
