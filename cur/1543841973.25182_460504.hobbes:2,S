There is an implicit reinterpret_cast<> from char* to void* when using 
memcmp, because void* is what memcpy takes as first argument. So, in effect 
we are doing
	memcmp((void *)(char *)(dent + 1), ...)
and that cast is, in this case, redundant, meaning we can do
	memcmp((void *)(dent + 1), ...)
But since conversion from and to void* is implicit in C, we can do
	memcmp(dent + 1, ...)

Now there is no rule in CodingStyle for this yet. Plus, I was wanting to show
how to reorder the construct, so change in whitespace between "if" and "(" is
outoftopic.
11:17 gwdg-wb04A:~/linux > grep -Pri '(if|for|while)\(' . | wc -l

[To be honest, I also present the other number:]
11:17 gwdg-wb04A:~/linux > grep -Pri '(if|for|while) \(' . | wc -l
380895
Although a minority, it does not seem so uncommon.

I would very much like to do just this
		many insns;
	} else if(...) {
		single insn;
	}
but again, some people think no {} should be there because it's just a single
insn. Though I don't go harvesting in lkml.org archives right now to prove
this claim.

Intent was reduction of indent. ""The answer to that is that if you need
more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix
your program."" so says CodingStyle, though the 3-level barrier was only
touched this time.
No offense!
