My knee jerk response is "good luck with that". I hope you're not
planning a GUI, because tracing the mouse movements, clicks, and
window placement in order to identify what action the admin is taking
is going to be a without-a-net trick.

I would suggest that you'll have to do that as well so that you can tell
the difference between typed actions like these:
# cat > /dev/null
badprogram --badthing --everyone
^D
#
# badprogram --badthing --everyone
where the same typed line is a Bad Thing in one case and completely
irrelevent in the other.

Yes. Your Linux system performs millions (yea, billions) of security
relevent actions in the time it takes you (well, me) to spell check an
lkml posting. Audit systems spew lots of data because there's lots of
data that is required to track who did what to whom.

OK. They're not willing to pay the price for the result they are asking for.
> Casey, so what approach would you take to meet the requirement?
If the requirement is that all human initiated administrative actions
be audited your only option is to seriously restrict the actions that
the human can perform by hand. This is usually accomplished by providing
an administration user interface facility as the admin shell. This shell
only invokes a tightly controlled set of commands, and audits their
parameters.

Perhaps.

As an adjunct to system level audit it might be helpful, but
it cannot stand on its own.
