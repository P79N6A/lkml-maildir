I've got patches that noone has seen because I haven't posted them yet
(my test box crashed yesterday and I didn't have time to make sure it
wasn't my new patches) you are going to need to rebase this against.
Adding more nfs'isms to selinux code isn't a good thing in the long
run.  But, does this even really work?  I thought both NFS and NFSv4
were actually passing around struct nfs_parsed_mount_data now rather
than just nfs_mount_data.  Maybe not, but this patch, although fine
for testing isn't fine to go in.  I'll get you and the list my new
option interfaces on monday so we can get NFS out of all of the LSMs
and get SELinux out of NFS.
