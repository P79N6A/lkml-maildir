Before that. I mean, to let Vendor to choose (and software operate) GPIO
and then to have headache, you've described. Also, here i'm not going
wider, than hardware cabel detection/max speed test (IMHO it must be
pretty easy).

Plain-text passwords -- i don't actually know, if they are useful at all.
What if BIOS has admin/user passwords set?
(kernel: if you have BIOS password, press RESET; if you don't press POWER ;)

I thought versions, revisions, stepping are indicators of that, and
OS have workarounds, fixes, optimizations, based on that kind of
information. "BIOS vendors", as i read here, are IMHO -bug-in-the-middle-
attack (:
Kind regards, guys.
