Means that your system would have oopsed if it hadn't
tested for the bogus register read (NDP).  That's only one
path; other bogus reads (which could also oops) on other
paths are undetected.  Slightly less-bogus reads on that
particular path may not be detected, and can still oops.

Then feel free to develop and submit a better fix.  That'd
be more practical if AMD's workaround were public.  As I
understand it, the bulk of the production chips have this
erratum.  More power to RedHat getting info from AMD.
Meanwhile, this patch improves robustness.
