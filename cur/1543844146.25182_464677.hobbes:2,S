Yes ! That might be a better idea !
In fact, I tested the 1st patch on our cluster (Finite elements computing on 8 
CPUs):
- Under Windows: 875 seconds
- Linux 2.6.16 : 1019 s
- Linux 2.6.16 + manual taskset : 842 s
- Linux 2.6.16 + Vincent's patch : 1373 s  :-(
If you find time to write a patch, Antonio, I would be pleased to try it !
Cheers,
