Its worth noting Linus tried page tricks for pipe copying including
doing copy-on-write stuff briefly and the only thing it improved where

And you can do that with some kind of mmap() ring buffer protocol set
up in advance in user space and avoid continually remapping

Perhaps what you need is a mix - user->user is done via user handshaking
protocols mostly (think about blocking I/O - there you want tiny bits
of kernel help). user<->socket with some kind of ring buffer protocol would
be the kernel talking it in that case
