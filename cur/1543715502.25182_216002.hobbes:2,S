Actually not. You need a FIFO to cache your bits into buffers of bytes
anyway. Depending upon the length of the FIFO, you can "rubber-band" a
lot of rotational latency. When you are dealing with a lot of drives,
you are never going to have all the write currents turn on at the same
time anyway because they are (very) soft-sectored, i.e., block
replacement, etc.
Your argument was used to shout down the idea. Actually, I think
it was lost in the NIH syndrome anyway.
