Subject: scsi_eh_x/scsi_wq_x "zombie" processes in kernel 2.6.13+

Starting around kernel version 2.6.13, the scsi_eh_x and scsi_wq_x
processes that are created per scsi host will not terminate if the
driver for the scsi interface is removed. I don't know whether there
are any serious problems involved with this, but one thing that is
definitely annoying, is that the process list fills very quickly when
modules are loaded/unloaded on demand, because 2 new processes will
be created every time the driver for a scsi adapter gets loaded.
(I guess, this happens with all scsi host modules - in my case, the
"culprit" is a qlogic fibre channel driver that gets loaded only when
needed.)
