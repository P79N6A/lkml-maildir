Greetings,
If I am to cache a pointer to current, say, at some stage of my driver
(after a kernel_thread, for instance), and then at a later time want to
check to see if that process still exists before I do something like modify
it, is there a way short of locking and walking the task list?
This is in 2.2.
thanks,
-bp
