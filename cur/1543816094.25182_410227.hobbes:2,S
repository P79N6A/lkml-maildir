It might be worth replacing the sky2 driver with the newest bleeding 
edge one over here:
http://developer.osdl.org/shemminger/prototypes/sky2-1.0msi.tar.gz
You might also want to check the developer's blog entry:

sky2 1.0?
Looks like a found the root cause of the sky2 hangs on pci-express. I 
copied some code from the SysKonnect driver that reconfigured the 
pci-express max request size. This probably caused receive dma engine to 
fail in face of contention. That will teach me to stop copy/pasting in 
bugs.

It might fix some of you issues ..
