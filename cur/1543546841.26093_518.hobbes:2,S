Stop this bandying my name about.
The only thing Linus wants is SANE SEMANTICS.
It so happens, that POSIX seems to be insane. Quite frankly, some of
POSIX is utter crap. Cow-dung. In short, shit.
And the reason pthreads have some problems is because the stupid thing
was never designed. It grew out of 1:m implementations and the Sun
threading code.
I want to have pthreads support for Linux. But I do not want the crap in
pthreads to get into the kernel. Which means that I want people to THINK
before they code something up. A 1:1 pthreads implementation simply
isn't going to make it, but something that happens to have the
braindamaged pthreads stuff as a subcase (with some help from user
space) is more than welcome.
This is not something new. I, unlike the POSIX committee, have more taste
than willingness to get reamed up the ass by years of history.
Deal with it.
