I think the real solution should be 
	void (*function)(struct timer_list *timer);
and hand the timer itself to the callback. Most of the timers are
embedded into data structures anyway and for the rest we can easily
build one.

There are ~ 500 files affected and this is in the range of cleanups we
did recently at the end of the merge window already. I'd volunteer to
hack this up and keep the patch up to date until the final merge. I have
done that before and I'm not scared about it. The patches are a couple
of lines per file and I do not agree that this is impossible to review.
