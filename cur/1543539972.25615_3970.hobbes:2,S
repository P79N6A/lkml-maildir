   Alright, well hows this: The info struct won't have a pgrp or
   session set until after an open has completed (they are set right at the end
   of rs_open, and info is memset to zero by get_async_struct).
   So on line 1316, if you do:
   1316c1316
   <               if (retval) {
   ---
   >               if (retval && !info->session) {
   1324a1325,1326
   >               else if (retval)
   >                   goto errout;
Note, please send unified diffs (diff -u); ed-style diffs like what you
sent me are very painful to try to use unless I'm using exactly the same
source base as you are (which very often isn't the case).
