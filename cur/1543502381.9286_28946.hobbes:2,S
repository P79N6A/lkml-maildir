   I think you're painting this as too much of the apocolypse; 2.2 (and
   2.3) breaks compatability with 2.0 more than 2.0 broke compatability
   with 1.2, but many of the broken things can be patched around, if
   you're willing to never go back to 1.2.13
   I've found that I needed to (a) either use devfs to get around the
   arbitary twidding of major numbers or run MAKEDEV to get the new
   major numbers, (b) do a tiny patch to the kernel to put back the old
   locking ioctls with libc4 uses, (c) do something with dhcpcd, if you
   use it, because the tcp stack was broken in 2.1 and old dhcpcd's
   stopped working, and (d) make certain that you're running a recent
   set of binutils (2.8 or better), a recent gcc (2.7.2.*), a new set of
   the ldso tools (1.9.9 seem to work for me).
   If you build all this stuff from scratch, it will take about a
   day, and when you're done you should have your systems in a
   state where 2.2 and 2.3 will work.
   Should, I say, because I've backed down to 2.0.28+logo because
   it's too damn hard to find a way to shoehorn that additional
   110k of kernel size onto an install floppy.
