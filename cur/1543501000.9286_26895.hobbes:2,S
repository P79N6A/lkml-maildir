Well, it seems to make more sense to have a well-defined place (like the
start of the subject line rather than have it "in the headers".  I like
precision.  Causes less problems downstream.
And the "If your mail client can't sort properly..." is a fatuous
argument.  Taken to the other extreme, would it cause insurmountable
problems to the other "several thousand" on the mailing list?  I think
not.
