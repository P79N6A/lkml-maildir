Ok... moved the HDDs from the VIA secondary to the PDC primary (tried 
moving both, but it seems that ide=reverse doesn't work), and the 
CD-R/W to the VIA secondary.
good news, regular reads seem to use the DMA engine. bad news, CDDA 
ripping (using cdparanoia) does not.
is this a known issue? (i thought that CDDA ripping had been fixed)
Haven't tested burning yet.
Hope this all helps, and doesn't annoy too much ;)
