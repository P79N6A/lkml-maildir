It sure does - if I'll do "rmmod mmc" I'd be forced to remove my driver as well (symbol
dependency) and the problem will magically disappear.
The problem here is that mmc_block's device is a child of real device (tifm_dev here), so it gets
resumed right after it. However, it correct functioning depends on mmc_core, which must be
manually resumed (mmc_resume_host). Therefore, I think this is purely mmc's problem.
