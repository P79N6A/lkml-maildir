Adding some explanation in Bartlomiej reply :
The standards are related to bus on which the device (hard disk in
your case) are attached ! As HDD can be connected to IDE/ATA, SCSI or
SATA or so on .... so they are the standard for connectivity between
the device and system ... And the device (like HDD) need to provide
that standard interface for connectivity but can do what-ever they
like internally through its firmware or driver (CMIIW)
