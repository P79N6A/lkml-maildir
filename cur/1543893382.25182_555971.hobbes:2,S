What's involved in doing this?  Do you have any pointers or sample code
that could be used here?
I'd assume that we'd just use AUTH_CIPHER_WEP/AUTH_CIPHER_NONE and
AUTH_KEY_MGMT_NONE in ConfigRidExtra.  But where does the WEP key
material go, does it get stuffed into the WpaKeyRid too or somewhere
else?
