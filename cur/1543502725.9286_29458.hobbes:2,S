While this is probably true for Linux proper, I came across this glitch
running a Mach kernel that uses the Linux net drivers through a glue
layer. The glue layer currently can only handle kmalloc()s up to 64K minus
a few bytes, so given the default rx buffer size of 64K, the kmalloc
actually will _always_ fail.

Because you're such a nice guy who writes code that behaves well even
on different OSs than the one it was supposed to run on??? ;-)
