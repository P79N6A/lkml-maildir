With Bk6 and beyond I recieve a
command 0x25 Timeout Stat 0x50 host-stat 0x4  and then a hang in init.
I can cntl alt del to reboot.
This is with a Maxtor 6y160po  YAR4,  I also have a Maxtor 6y250P0
Earlier in the boot sequence I recieve a screaming interupt message and
interupt turned off message for the interupt used by the controller.
These work for 2.6.7 and 2.6.7 bk5.
It works for the ide implementation with the thousands of
sata_error = 0x00000000, watchdog = 0, siimage_mmio_ide_dma_test_irq
messages.
thanks  Hubert
