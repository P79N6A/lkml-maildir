exactly. If you want to nuke the run_all_timers from the 2.4 backport
feel free, then we could drop the additional locking from
add_timer/del_timer* and leave it only in mod_timer like 2.6 does, that
will avoid cacheline bouncing in the small window when the local timer
irq run on top of an irq handler. In the meantime the kernel is already
solid (again ;).
2.6 will kernel crash like we did in 2.4 only if it calls
add_timer_on from timer context (of course with a cpuid != than the
smp_processor_id()), that would be fixed by the timer->lock everywhere
that we've in 2.4 right now.  (but there's no add_timer_on in 2.4
anyways)
BTW, it's reassuring it wasn't lack of 2.6 stress testing, I apologize
for claiming that.
