hm, is there no other workload on the system? Could you run the 
following script:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
while you are busy opening new tabs on a CFSv19 kernel (and send me the 
file it outputs)?
One way to start up the script precisely would be to start it in a 
terminal like this:
  sleep 10; echo "soon ..."; sleep 1; ./cfs-debug-info.sh
that way you have 10 seconds to switch from the terminal to firefox, and 
you can time the delay of firefox precisely on the start-time of the 
debug script.
