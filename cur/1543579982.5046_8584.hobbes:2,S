Then I suppose that you've checked that never in kernel printk arguments
have side effects, don't you ;-)
printk("%d", p());
printk("%d", a++);
etc.
You're changing semantics of a well known function and also if you don't
broke anything now, what grants this for the future?
You need also a big warning in printk documentation: "Note that
arguments may to be not evaluated" and hope everybody note it.
I'd prefer to rely on modern compiler smartness.
