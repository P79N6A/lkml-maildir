Well that surely shouldnt happen...I use minicom all the time (I still
call BBSes), and havent had any crashes.  I can quit/disconnect, or 
quit/stay connected and it works okay.   I've even got it set up to
use 230000bps, which is the max my Zoom will take.
When I was trying to set up the ESP shortly after I'd received it,
there was some trial+error to get the address/irq/dma/jumpers set right,
and minicom would hang (the program), but I could kill it.  It took about
an hour to get the settings the way I'd wanted them, and since then...
no real problems.

I also have a SB16 (non-PnP).  I use DMA 1 and 5 for the SB16 and 3 for
the ESP.    I dont know if it's doing anything though...wish there were a
way to know how deep into the buffers it ever gets on transfers.  DMA
threshold on mine is the default value (I believe it's 32 bytes) -- it
wouldnt suprise me if it didnt get that deep, keeping the rx_threshold
so low.
My modules.conf ESP section looks like:
#
# Hayes ESP module + options
# port 180h, irq 3, dma 3, divisor 4
options esp irq=0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0 dma=3 divisor=0,0,0x04,0,0,0,0,0 rx_timeout=1
post-install esp setserial /dev/ttyP16 low_latency
alias char-major-57 esp
alias chat-major-58 esp
Only troubles it's given me lately is that esp.c isnt a devfs-aware
driver.  I've been experimenting with devfs lately, so I have to do
a "mknod /dev/ttyP16 c 57 16" every time I boot, and it still barks out
a few meaningless errors (cup: device already registered).
I just have the one-port ESP card.
