Subject: [PATCH] mv643xx_eth support for platform device interface + more
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In porting the mv643xx ethernet driver for use by PPC, I modified it
to use the platform device interface, fixed the hardware checksum support
and did some miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.
I'll follow up with these six patches:
 1 Remove redundant or useless code.
 2 Replace fixed count spins with waits on hardware status bits
 3 Fix code to enable hardware checksum generation for TX packets
 4 Convert from pci_map_* to dma_map_* interface
 5 Add support for platform device interface
 6 Add support for several configurable parameters via platform device
Of these patches, the only one that changes the driver interface is patch 5.
I don't have any MIPS hardware, so I'd appreciate testing by those who do.
I have some additional cleanups, but I want to get these in the queue
or at least get feedback first.
Thanks,
-Dale Farnsworth
