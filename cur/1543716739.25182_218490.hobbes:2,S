How are you verifying that the 2.4 driver is coming-up in 2Gig rather
than 1gig?  Do you have an analyzer running between the HBA and
storage device?  Or, as you mentioned later in the email when testing
the 8.x driver, did you force 2gig at the RAID box and reload the
2.4 driver?

Yes, the 8.x series driver started to display the connection speed
during a loop_up event.
	qla2300 0000:01:05.0: LOOP UP detected (1 Gbps).

Which model?  Actually, looking ahead, I can see you are running an
	Vendor: IFT       Model: A16F-G1A2         Rev: 334A
Of the three FC-SATA RAID boxes that are advertised, only the
A16F-J1210-G1 model mentions support for 'full-duplex 2Gb FC-AL'.

Hmm, could you go into the BIOS utility (ctrl-q during boot) and check
the 'Data Rate' settings for the HBA?  What is the value set to --
auto/1gb/2gb?  If it is set to auto, could you set it to 2gb and retry
the test.
