What's wrong with just:
	schedule_timeout_{,un}interruptible(msecs_to_jiffies(some_constant_msecs));
The majority of users use a constant, which can already be converted at 
compile tile.
Additionally such an interface also had to return a ms value and instead 
of that constant conversion, the user is better off to work with jiffies 
directly.
