I'd have to agree - our Alpha development platform has been up on 2.0.35
since October, and I think it hasn't needed to be rebooted yet, except
when we moved from our old facility to the current one at EOY98.  We
also had another box that was one of our network servers and had been
running a really old version of Linux (1.something) for two years
straight before it finally died (disk errors, not Linux problems).begin:vcard
