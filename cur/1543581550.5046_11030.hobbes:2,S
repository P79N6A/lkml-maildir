Maciej's io-apic patch fixed the long-standing problems with my
ne2k-pci card (since at least 2.4.0-test10, and absent in 2.2.17).
Ne2k-pci card (D-Link, exact model # would require a reboot and
card pull)
Dual 366 Celeron / Abit BP6 / 128MB (Problem showed up at both 366/550)
Eth0 has over 3 million interrupts, and no loss of connection.
2.4.0 (not .1)
Thanks!
