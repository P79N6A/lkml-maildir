This actually looks like a nice example where the use of select would
work nicely.  IOW:
config PARPORT_ARC
	tristate "Archimedes hardware"
	depends on ARM && PARPORT
	select PARPORT_NOT_PC
config PARPORT_AMIGA
	tristate "Amiga builtin port"
	depends on AMIGA && PARPORT
	select PARPORT_NOT_PC
config PARPORT_NOT_PC
	bool
And I notice in passing that you've already used select on this new
configuration option in USB, and this new configuration option is user
visible.  Bad.
The golden rule (if you don't wish _me_ to complain) is:
   Don't use select on user-visible options.  Either make them
   non-user visibile or don't use select at all.
In this case, the former is far more preferable because it means that
the existing defconfig files don't need to be fixed for their parports
work again.
