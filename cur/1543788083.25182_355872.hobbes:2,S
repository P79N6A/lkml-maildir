I found out that the pauses only occur when the X server is running,
not when I work on the console, or remotely. I can easily reproduce
the problem by playing an mp3 file in a console with mpg321, and then
running burnK7 to force frequency scaling. Without X server running,
everything works fine, but when the X server is running, the music
skips on frequency changes. However, when I start the X server, but
switch back to the console with CTRL-ALT-F1, there are no skips.
Apparently, some Ubuntu users experienced the same problem:

I already recompiled the kernel with CONFIG_PREEMPT, but that doesn't
help. Is this some timing issue in the X server (X.org 6.8.2)? Is
there something else to try?
