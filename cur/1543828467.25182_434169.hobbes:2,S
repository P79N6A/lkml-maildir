Hello!
With 2.6.17 the PC speaker stopped working (2.6.16.20 was fine). The
module pcspkr is loaded but dmesg doesn't show that it gets registered
as 2.6.16 did:
input: PC Speaker as /class/input/input2
I saw a thread about the speaker issue a while ago in which a patch
was posted that made it into 2.6.17 but somehow it doesn't seem
to be enough. Am I missing something?
I'm running x86-64 kernel with 32-bit userspace if that should matter.
Please CC me as I'm not subscribed.
