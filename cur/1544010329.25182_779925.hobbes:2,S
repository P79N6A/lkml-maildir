After applying Manfred's patch to .9-rc1, it *seems* that the problem is
gone. I have put the Windows client to sleep several times and after the
20-something minutes timeout smbd reports the error ("No route to host")
but does not go into a spinloop any more.
I'll continue to test this, but as far as I'm concerned this should go
into stable.9 as well (not sure if it's already in rc2).
thanks!
