Some network drivers still feed entropy pools :
$ find drivers/net | xargs grep -n IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM
drivers/net/mv643xx_eth.c:1336:                 IRQF_SHARED | 
IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, dev->name, dev);
drivers/net/3c527.c:437:        err = request_irq(dev->irq, 
&mc32_interrupt, IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, DRV_NAME, dev);
drivers/net/xen-netfront.c:1371:                                        
IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, netdev->name,
drivers/net/macb.c:1131:        err = request_irq(dev->irq, 
macb_interrupt, IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM,
drivers/net/tg3.c:7268:         flags = IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM;
drivers/net/tg3.c:7273:         flags = IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM;
drivers/net/tg3.c:7291:                   IRQF_SHARED | 
IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, dev->name, dev);
drivers/net/qla3xxx.c:3648:     unsigned long irq_flags = 
IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM | IRQF_SHARED;
drivers/net/3c523.c:292:        ret = request_irq(dev->irq, 
&elmc_interrupt, IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM,
drivers/net/cris/eth_v10.c:704:                 IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, 
cardname, (void *)dev)) {
drivers/net/atl1/atl1_main.c:1967:      int irq_flags = IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM;
drivers/net/niu.c:4647:                           IRQF_SHARED | 
IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM,
drivers/net/netxen/netxen_nic_main.c:866:                                 
IRQF_SHARED|IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, netdev->name,
drivers/net/ibmlana.c:784:      result = request_irq(priv->realirq, 
irq_handler, IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM, dev->name, dev);
So I guess you could patch your kernel to get more entropy sources (even 
if they are not *perfect* for some purists)
