Subject: Xen VMM patch set - take 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We've sync'ed up with the head of the Xen repository, and also brought
the patch up to 2.6.10-rc3
The patches are pretty much identical to the take 3 set, which people
seemed to be pretty happy with.
To get a working arch xen system you need the following set of
patches:
 1. add ptep_establish_new to make va available
 2. return code for arch_free_page
 3. runtime disable of VT console
 4. HAS_ARCH_DEV_MEM enables Xen to use own /dev/mem definition
 5. split free_irq into teardown_irq
 6. alloc_skb_from_cache	(already accepted by Dave Miller)
The actual new architecture, arch xen, is too big to post to the list,
so here's a link:

Likewise for the virtual block, network, and console drivers:

Arch xen will be maintained by myself, Keir Fraser, Christian Limpach
and Steve hand. 
Cheers,
Ian
