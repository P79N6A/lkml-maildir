Most quad Tulip boards have the bus bridge wired so that all interrupts
are sent on the INTA output of the board.
The tulip.c driver has worked around the BIOS bug on x86 machines for
years.  It should really be handled in the generic PCI quirks code, but
has not yet been correctly handled in the kernel's code.
