Yes, I see, and that does work for most ethernet devices.
I noticed that Debian's 3.1 installer used this to determine
which ethernet device it should use as the default in it's
network device dialogue.
One idea, returning true for get_link when the device is down, may not
be a bad idea for the wireless case.
