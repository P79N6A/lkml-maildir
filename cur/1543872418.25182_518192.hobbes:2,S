Con, you've really outdone yourself this time ! :D
As a long time user of the -ck patchset, RSDL is a welcome change, and a great 
piece of code to play around with, and USE!
Booted up on my system perfectly, Pentium-D 830 3GHz, 1.5GB RAM.
No problems whatsoever so far, using 0.26. I can launch up a bunch of encode 
jobs, in SCHED_NORMAL even, and still have low latency on my desktop (I know 
it's not low latency _specific_ code, but it works very well).
I guess all I can say is.. wow. This code isn't "prime time" ready, yet.. But 
it can be, and would be a great addition to mainline.
Hell, a little tuning and merging this with a few current ck patches could 
make a damn fine kernel, and probably beat out the original staircase in 
desktops. :)
Keep up the good work !
