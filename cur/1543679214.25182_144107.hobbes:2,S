not in all cases. for the classical "mkdir a; chroot a; chdir ..", you need a
writable directory to create "a" or an existing directory somewhere to serve
as a mount point. If neither of them is true, I don't see other means of
escaping the chroot. And here, ".." is the only one I could exploit, that's why
I proposed this patch which closes what is, to me, the only weakness in this
very particular case.
Cheers,
Willy
