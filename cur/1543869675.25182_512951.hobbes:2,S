Richard,
2.6.21-rc1 on my ibm t42p dims a LCD after some time (I guess it happens 
at the time the console should normally be blanked). 
When I hit the keyboard, the brightness stays low (it's 50% of light or 
so, so I could read what's on the screen, but it's uncomfortably dim), and 
I have to manually raise the brightness on the LCD. Quite annoying :)
I have bisected this to your commit 
994efacdf9a087b52f71e620b58dfa526b0cf928
Thanks,
