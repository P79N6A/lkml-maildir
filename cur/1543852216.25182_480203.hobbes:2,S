There is off-by-one bug in the condition. It should be:
(time_spent_in_spinlock + time_spent_outside_spinlock) / 
time_spent_in_spinlock < number_of_cpus
... or if you divide it by time_spent_in_spinlock:
time_spent_outside_spinlock / time_spent_in_spinlock + 1 < number_of_cpus

If some rogue threads (and it may not even be intetional) call the same 
syscall stressing the one spinlock all the time, other syscalls needing 
the same spinlock may stall.
Maybe there are so few Altices in the world that no one has yet observed 
it...
