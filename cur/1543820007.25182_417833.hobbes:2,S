I'd be willing to at least *listen* to an argument of the form "paths are
in general broken, but we have constraints X, Y, and Z on the system such
that the broken parts never manifest" (for instance, a restriction on
hardlinks that prevents hardlinking 2 files unless the resulting security
domains of the two paths would be identical).
However, I'll say up front that such an argument would only suffice to
move it from "broken" to "very brittle in face of changes" (for instance,
would such a hardlink restriction cause collateral damage that an attacker
could exploit?  How badly does it fail in the face of a misdesigned policy?)
