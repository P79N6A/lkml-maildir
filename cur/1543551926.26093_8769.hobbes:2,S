(Decides to take another peek.  Yup, scsi logging adds quite a bit)
Looks like deadlock at scsi.c:696 to me.  ide_end_request() has the
io_request_lock on cpu0 and we try to grab it again with the same cpu.
What is unclear to me (SMP.. technology, sufficiently advanced.. magic)
is how in the heck the scsi interrupt happened on cpu0.  It _looks_ to
me as though md_spin_unlock_irq() enabled interrupts at a very bad time.

If this were happening on my system, I'd boldly change raid1_free_bh()
like such..

..and see if the problem went away.
Now, if I'm off base, someone please clean my clock so I'll understand
better next time I foolishly attempt to figure out an SMP deadlock ;-)
