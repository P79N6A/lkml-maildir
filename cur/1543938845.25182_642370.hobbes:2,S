Regular kmem_getpages is called with GFP_THISNODE set. There was some 
breakage in 2.6.22 and before with GFP_THISNODE returning pages from the 
wrong node if a node had no memory. So it may have worked accidentally and 
in an unsafe manner because the pages would have been associated with the 
wrong node which could trigger bug ons and locking troubles.
