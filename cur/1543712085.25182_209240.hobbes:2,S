I think the correct thing to do is to just admit that cowlinks aren't
POSIX, and instead see the inode number as a way to see whether the link
has been broken or not. Ie just accept the inode number potentially
changing.
That would make "diff" (adn most other uses) ok with this, and anythign 
that isn't, just couldn't be used with cowlinked files.
