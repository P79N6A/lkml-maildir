IDE DMA is PCI not ISA. It appears your mainboard is dying when both ISA
and PCI DMA occur together. If so you'd want to drop the ESS audiodrive
into PIO mode assuming ALSA supports it (OSS doesnt although I've got
the docs if you care that much).
Can you do another test here - write to a floppy disk while doing IDE
DMA and see if it also hangs.
