I'm really sick of being buried in useless information. The signal
gets lost in the noise. It is easy to discard automatically generated
bug reports, and way too annoying to wade through the crud.
When network connections hang, the console-tools package version
isn't likely to be of any use. When ramfs leaks memory, nobody needs
the content of /proc/pci.
Sometimes the bit of crud are HUGE. Imagine the hardware info
for a 64-way SGI or Sun box with plenty of devices attached.
