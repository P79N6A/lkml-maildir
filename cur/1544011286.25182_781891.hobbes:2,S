Yes, people write to me asking for the SR-IOV patch or update everyday 
-- I guess they don't want to let their competitors know they are 
working on it so they can't bring their questions up on the mailing list.
And I personally also have dozen of other patches related to PCI and KVM 
subsystems which depend on the SR-IOV change.
