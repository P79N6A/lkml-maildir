	Maybe I got something wrong, but could someone please help me to
understand why introduce _IOR_BAD here? Thanks first! :)
	IMO, the birth of new ioctl definition convention considers
"size" of argument as a part, so we should conform to this rule.
_IOR_BAD is no different as old one <_IOR('@', 1, sizeof(__u32*))>,
which expands as sizeof(sizeof(__32*)) and actually assume temp result
of internal sizeof as the argument. Of course this didn't reflect the
true point and we should change the definition. :)
	Also I'm confused about the modification about using size_t to
replace sizeof(). Take MATROXFB_SET_OUTPUT_MODE for example:
(old)	#define MATROXFB_SET_OUTPUT_MODE
_IOW('n',0xFA,sizeof(struct matroxioc_output_mode))
(now)	#define MATROXFB_SET_OUTPUT_MODE        _IOW('n',0xFA,size_t)
	The size of matroxioc_output_mode is 8 bytes on all platforms,
however size_t will be calculated as 4 bytes on 32bit arch and 8 bytes
on 64bit arch. So this is also like using sizeof(), which imposes the
difference between 32bit ioctl number and 64bit ioctl number. However in
standard manner, I mean:
	#define MATROXFB_SET_OUTPUT_MODE        _IOW('n',0xFA,struct
matroxioc_output_mode)
 	The value should be identical on all platforms, which save our
efforts to do useless conversion when running 32bit apps on 64bit
platform.
	The most important is: to use sizeof() or size_t here both
messed the ioctl definition, which violate the initial motivation of
_IO**, is it?

	Agree. The inaccurate name here confused us... :)
