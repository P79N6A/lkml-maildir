Well, I compiled 2.3.9-pre2 and ran it through the same test I've given
all the other kernels with the page cache changes thus far :)  I attempted
to copy a 170 meg file around the local filesystem and then tried to copy
the same file to the 2.3.9-pre2 machine over NFS from a machine running
2.3.6.  Both copies worked without any attempt to access beyond end of
device errors and without any oopsen which seems like a good sign :)  It
also appears that loopback mounts of cd images work again...
Now we can see how many features we can add and still have a 2.4 by the
end of the year :)
