I think that's just a bug, the same way it was a bug that preemtion would
sometimes set tsk->state to TASK_RUNNING.
I think Robert already sent a fix: make "preempt_schedule()" refuse to
schedule if local interrupts are disabled.
That, together with making it a warning (so that we can _fix_ places that
have unbalanced irq/spinlock behaviour) shoul dbe fine. Eventually, if we
think all places are fixed, we can remove the test from
preempt_schedule().
