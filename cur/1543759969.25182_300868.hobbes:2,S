Acrypto does not actually know about keys, ivs and other.
It is layer between crypto devices(which require key) and crypto consumers
(which provide the key).
One may fill key and iv sg as NULL and put them to the private area, 
and then create approprite crypto device, which will obtain them from there,
but not using key/iv sgs.
Acrypto do not use such information.
Of course, one may patch bd_acrypto.c/cryptoloop.c/dm_crypt.c 
to use above schema, but it is too complex for the model used,
but nevertheless it can be used, I do not disput against it 
in bd_acrypto/cryptoloop/dm_crypt.
