Good question. As I read the patch, the problem occurs during umount,
when dirty inodes are not (properly) written to the disk. Would a sync()
help or eliminate this problem, assuming that all files were closed?
Hopefully someone knows, I don't want to tell you it only happens at
umount, but that's my impression.
In any case, since 2.4.16 is out (so much for "2.4.15 released without
embarrassment") to fix the problem, I would go with that unless you have
a reason to use whichever patch pleases you.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
