For Fortuna, correct.  This is why I believe /dev/random's current
design to be superior.

(1) Your method of "producing collisions" assumed that /dev/random was
of the form HASH("a\0\0\0...") == HASH("a) --- i.e., you were
kvetching about the lack of padding.  But we've already agreed that
the padding argument isn't applicable for /dev/random, since it only
hashes block-sizes at the same time.  (2) Even if there were real
collisions demonstrated in SHA-1's cryptographic core at some point in
the future, it wouldn't harm the security of the algorithm, since
/dev/random doesn't depend on SHA-1 being resistant against
collisions.  (Similarly, HMAC-MD5 is still safe for now since it also
is designed such that the ability to find collisions do not harm its
security.  It's a matter of how you use the cryptographic primitives.)

That's correct.  It is my contention that Fortuna is brittle in this
regard, especially in comparison to /dev/random current design.
And you still haven't pointed out the logic flaw in any argument but
your own.
