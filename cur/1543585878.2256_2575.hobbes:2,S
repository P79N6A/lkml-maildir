Sort of.  A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that 2 TB is only 25
80GB IDE drives.  Given 4 3ware 8-channel IDE controllers and a large
enough case, you could probably build a cheap 2TB RAID0 array for ~$10k.
You could do RAID5 for only slightly more.
While this isn't exactly a standard, off-the-shelf, general-purpose sort
of configuration, it definately has its uses.  Be careful assuming that
huge amounts of disk storage requires a huge amount of money, or a high
level of reliability or performance.
