I think the reasoning goes the way Arjan described.  Suppose in between
#1 and #2 there is thread #3 trying to do down_write(A) and waiting for
#1.  Then thread #2 doesn't have to wait for #1 directly, but it would
have to wait for #3.
In my case the simplest answer appears to be the replace the rwsem
with something slightly more complicated (a mutex plus a boolean flag 
-- the loss of concurrency won't matter much since it isn't on a hot 
path).
Thanks for the comment.
