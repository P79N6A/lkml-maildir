For some people centrino seems to work a little better so it may
be BIOS bugs too. The usual "buy something 6 months old" rule applies
to BIOS code as well as anything else

Intel are still being a pain about this. Quite why they think its
a secret is beyond me. Fortunately every other CPU vendor is being a 
lot more positive.

There are awkward issues there certainly.

Time may change that. The ATI/ALi chipset AMD laptops like the Compaq
z9xx were really Linux hostile. Now with the right stuff in place and
some things fixed (some working around their bugs, some fixing ours)
they work really well.
Centrino ultimately is a help - the laptop chipset space is
consolidating and there are less and less variations appearing. That
helps us because there is less to support. Its the same as with X and
IDE and other things nowdays - we get a lot less deeply weird hardware
to fight.
