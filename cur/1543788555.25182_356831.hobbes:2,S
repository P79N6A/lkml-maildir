In its current form, there is very little use of huegtlb truncate
functionality.  Currently it only allows reducing the size of hugetlb
backing file.   
IMO it will be useful to keep and enhance this capability so that apps
can dynamically reduce or increase the size of backing files (for
example based on availability of memory at any time).
