Not for me:
        .file   "test.c"
        .section        .rodata.str1.1,"aMS",@progbits,1
.LC0:
        .string "%s"
        .text
        .p2align 4,,15
.globl test
        .type   test, @function
test:
        pushl   %ebp
        movl    %esp, %ebp
        subl    $12, %esp
        movl    %eax, 8(%esp)
        movl    $.LC0, %eax
        movl    %eax, 4(%esp)
        movl    $buf, (%esp)
        call    sprintf
        movl    %ebp, %esp
        popl    %ebp
        ret
        .size   test, .-test
.globl buf
        .bss
        .align 32
        .type   buf, @object
        .size   buf, 128
buf:
        .zero   128
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-2)"
Are you using exactly my example file?
Are you using the complete gcc command line as shown by "make V=1"?
Which gcc 3.3.3 are you using?

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
