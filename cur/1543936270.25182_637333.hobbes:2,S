Hello Marc,
Your patch looks good to me, and I have been waiting for something like 
this :). Other comments below.

At first sight, this will only work with the platforms which have implemented 
gpiolib, some (like MIPS) still use the old generic GPIO API. So I think the 
include will not work here for anything than ARM, correct me if I am wrong.

Some watchdog drivers requires you to toggle the full GPIO line, not only one 
bit (I particularly think about the MTX-1 board watchdog).
Did you look into hooking into Wim's uniform watchdog driver :

Maybe you can save some code ?
