I haven't worked that much with changers, but I see nothing
wrong with the configuration. If you need all trays mounted
at the same time, the /dev/changer patch would probably
come in handy. I don't know how well it works in real life
(one could easily imagine the scenario where all the time
would be spent changing discs and no real work would get
done).
You could also go for a big SCSI changer.
