What kernel/driver are you using for the S150 SX4?  I couldn't ever get 
better than 13MB/sec from it in 2.6.  Of course, the last I tried was 
2.6.3.  I could get 55MB/sec using 2.4 and Promise's partial source 
driver, but since my onboard SATA controller works fine in 2.6 I'm just 
using that meanwhile.
Thanks,
