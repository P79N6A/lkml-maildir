could you try and dissect patch-2.3.19 to find out which change causes
problems? There were no SMP changes in 2.3.19, but some PCI and e820
related changes. Probably it's useful to first isolate all arch/i386 and
include/asm-i386 and patch it on 2.3.18 and see wether it fails. Let me
know if you want me to send such separated patches, although i think it
can be done much better locally.
2.3.20 added the big 2.3 x86 SMP cleanup, so if it broke with patch-2.3.19
then the SMP code is not the first suspect i believe.
