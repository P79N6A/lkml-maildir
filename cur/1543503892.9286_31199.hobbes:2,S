I suppose it could be a processor-specific thing, but I'm leaning
towareds a BIOS/CPU interaction.  My system is a K6/350 in a TMC
motherboard which exhibited this problem.  Walter Hoffman posted a
message to this list awhile back which included an APM patch which
switched the processor to real mode before doing the power down.  It
completely solved a similar problem I had.
