In article <Pine.LNX.4.10.9908272008380.8443-100000@home.suse.com> you write:
>WD + Maxtor (same channel) == cat and dog in bag.
>(One animal is going to damage the other.)
This reminds me of drive incompatibilities that were common
some 5 years ago. Sigh...
>(Note that WD does not care about Linux, not a viable OS).
I'm glad I bought a Seagate ST39140N, not a WD drive, some
weeks ago (not an IDE drive, anyway).
