Yes, it can - the kernel driver just prints the data taken from the
accelerometer. It's up to another application to make sense out of this.
One purpose would be the mentioned "fall detector" that would then
instruct the disk drive to part its head.

Correct, that would be one option. Mark Smith (they IBM guy who wrote up
the information required to write the kernel module) actually mentioned
he had patched SDL to support the accelerometer as an input device.
Playing "Neverball" by tilting your Laptop sounds like fun :)
