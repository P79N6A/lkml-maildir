I have compiled 2.3.42 with 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX_TUNING=y        
and on boot the kernel says:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 21
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EL5.1A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: Pioneer CD-ROM ATAPI Model DR-A04S 0105, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide2: ports already in use, skipping probe
but cat /proc/ide/piix shows me:
[marco@localhost linux]$ cat /proc/ide/piix
                                Intel PIIX4 Chipset.
--------------- Primary Channel ---------------- Secondary Channel
------------- 
--------------- drive0 --------- drive1 -------- drive0 ----------
drive1 ------
Is there something wrong?
