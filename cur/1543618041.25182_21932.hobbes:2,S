That sounds OK.  Just print it first.  If it hits the logs then
great.  If it just scrolls off the screen then no loss.

Often the users know nothing about elf internals, kernel tools
and build processes and all of that.  They just want to get their
box back up and reliable, and they consider that any work they do 
in problem disgnosis is a favour for the developers (and I have no
problem with that attitude).
Often, we only get one shot at it.

It's in our interest to make it as easy as possible for the reporter.
Cut-and-paste is easy, so we should err on the side of overkill when
choosing which data to dump out.

Yeah, let's not do that.  (But I'd be on the "no" side :-))
