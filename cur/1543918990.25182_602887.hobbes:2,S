Please correct me, if I am wrong, but here is my guess:
I think that the new code gives actually better numbers for kontact. Kontact 
is using the cpu for very short periods, right? The old code updates utime 
and stime via sampling at each timer tick. If kontact is scheduled based on 
the timer tick(lets say timeout and a low amount of other interrupts) it will 
start shortly after a tick. If kontact now manages to return the cpu before 
the next tick, the old code would not account anything for kontact.
The new code instead, should be correct in terms of overall runtime as it 
accounts the scheduled time in ns.
Why does it still shows numbers going backwards? I guess the sampled values 
for stime and utime change in flight between task_utime and task_stime are 
called. Lets say utime will be increased. Given the same sum_exec_runtime 
that means that the result of task_stime() will get smaller at this point. 
So Chucks patch only deals with sum_exec_runtime changing.

Ingo, do you have any opinion about how to proceed?
