humtitim...
trying out on developer.skolelinux.no - a dual P III 997.5MHz (according to /proc/cpuinfo)
machine:
1. bench: utime=75.790s
2. bench: utime=76.570s
3. bench: utime=76.330s
avg. bench: utime=76.230s

strange... this shows marginally lower performance on mine than yours, but it still beats the
lot, including the Athlon. Can anyone explain this???????????
I beleive there was some talk on lkml about some sort of P4 optimisation (interrupt stuff) that
wasn't enabled on 2.4, but comes along in 2.5. Any ideas??? (I cc:ed the lkml on this one)

The system I was testing on had a load of around 1.2 or something, but given it's a system
with quite nice I/O and two 1GHz CPUs, I don't think it was important.
