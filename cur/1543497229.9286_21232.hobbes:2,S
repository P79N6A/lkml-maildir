Hi again!
tcpdump -ippp0 shows worst number of such error
17:19:14.175043 truncated-ip - 884 bytes missing!209.155.82.18.ftp-data
> 195.46.161.217.61864: . 11680:13140(1460) ack 1 win 17520 [tos 0x8]
http and ftp connection often drops.
This happened after upgrading to 2.2.8 kernel and beginning of
using ipchains. Had somebody the same problem?
Thanks in advance.
Vinche.
