Hi,
I got my hands on a Texas Instruments ThunderLAN PCI 100 Mbit card (PCI
ID 104c:0500), which is what SGI are supplying if you want a second NIC
in your O2.  It appears that this card is not supported by the tlan
driver in the Linux kernel (at least not in 2.4.29, which is what I am
using on the machine I tried it on).  Patching the driver with the
relevant PCI IDs allowed the detection of the card, as shown in dmesg:
ThunderLAN driver v1.15
TLAN: eth0 irq=15, io=8400, Compaq NetFlex-3/E, Rev. 48
TLAN: 1 device installed, PCI: 1  EISA: 0
and in "ifconfig eth0":
eth0	Link encap: Ethernet   HWaddr 00:00:58:01:55:53
(and the rest of the normal stuff)
but trying to configure the interface with an address and bringing
it up caused a kernel oops.  (This is on Alpha.)
# ifconfig eth0 inet blah... up
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000093fcb04
Segmentation fault
In dmesg, there is an
ifconfig(4218): Oops 0
followed by a register dump, a trace, and some code.
Any ideas?
