Hi Jens,
Sorry, I don't think I gave you any reply to this...

Interesting. I'd like to know where from. I wonder if my idea of a
process context plug/unplug would solve it...

But can some other thread calling lock_page first find the old mapping,
and then run its ->sync_page which finds the new mapping? While it may
not matter for anyone in-tree, it does break the API so it would be
better to either fix it or rip it out than be silently buggy.

Most code in the VM that has an inode/mapping gets called from the VFS,
which already does its thing somehow (I guess something like the file
pins the dentry which pins the inode). An iget might solve it. Or you
could use the lock_page_nosync() if/when the patch goes in (although I
don't want that to spread too far just yet).
