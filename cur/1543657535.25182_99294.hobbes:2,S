New experiments have yielded:
Mandrake's initscript leaves "/bin/true" in /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug.
According to man hotplug the path "/sbin/hotplug" should be there.
Putting "/sbin/hotplug" in there seems to stop the hanging.
Making sd-mod a module and then doing
modprobe usb-storage
modprobe sd-mod
after inserting a card and
modprobe -r sd-mod
modprobe -r usb-storage
after taking the card out seems to work, except in ps I get lines like
 1671 ?        SW     0:00 scsi_eh_3
where the X in scsi_eh_X gets larger each time and the old ones remain
forever.
