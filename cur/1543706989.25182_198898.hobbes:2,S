Hi Steve,
I am experiencing same problem with e1000 on 2.6.3-rc2-mm1 and all
previous 2.6 kernels with getting the transmit timed out messages.I do
not get the transmission errors though.The same setup works fine on 2.4
kernel just like yours.
This happens on Slackware 9.1 on NFORCE2 based Gigabyte 7NNXP board with
OEM Intel 1000MT builtin chip.
Have you found any solutions yet? 
Regards,
Paul B.
