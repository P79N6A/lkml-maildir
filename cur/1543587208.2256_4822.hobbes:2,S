My reasoning is that who uses a 386 is not interested in speed, so a little
bit more slowness is not that bad.
You realize that the alternative for distributions is to drop 386 support
completely?
Most 386 i've seen used for linux do not run multi threaded applications
anyways; they usually do things like ISDN routing. Also on early 386 with
the kernel mode wp bug it's a security hazard to use clone().
