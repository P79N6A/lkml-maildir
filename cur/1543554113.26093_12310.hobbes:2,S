It had been a long day.  I really do know the distinction :)
It is currently bus powered and I've only once had it self powered
several months ago.  It is an SIIG 4 port hub, I hadn't seen any
complaints about it doing a web search when I looked, so I purchased it.
I have found that after unplug/plug the mouse and reboot, If I unplug
the hub then the boot will continue fine, if I unplug the just the mouse
(which is plugged into the hub), the machine will indeed hang.  If I
reset the power on the hub and plug it back in it will still hang.
I must reset the power on the motherboard.
The oddity is that kdb shows the machine to lock up on the popf in
pci_conf_write_word()+0x2c.  I never did get around to digging up this
routine and looking at the code, but I suspect this is a final return
from the routine.  I'm rather confused however, I have no idea why a
flags pop would hang the hardware.
