Well, I don't think it would be _wrong_ to change the IRQ_INPROGRESS 
handling to work so that it's usabel for PPC.
Some of it may actually be purely historical: I have this dim memory that 
we may have used IRQ_INPROGRESS for the irq autodetection originally (it 
now uses the IRQ_WAITING flag for that).
So I was really only arguing for it not being actively buggy the way it is 
now - which is not to say that we can't change it to be friendlier to 
whatever your needs are.
Be vewy vewy caweful when changing that code, though. If you end up with a 
patch, please try to give it some nice stress-testing (both on ppc and 
x86), and then post it for comments, ok? Maybe the arch mailing list and 
Ingo (who else has touched that logic?)
