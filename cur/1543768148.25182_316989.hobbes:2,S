I'd do `nm -n vmlinux', see which data structures the linker placed nearby
to ptype_all and then go looking for overruns against them.
ptype_base is an array, but I cannot see any race around ptype_base.  So
look to see if ptype_base is corrupted as well, keep walking back through
memory, see where the scribble starts.
