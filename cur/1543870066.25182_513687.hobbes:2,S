Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20] kobject net ifindex + rename
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	Hi all,
	Various hotplug packages have had trouble dealing with network
interface being renamed. I've decided to tackle this issue from two
angles :
		o export ifindex to those apps, as ifindex is persistent.
		o expose interface renaming as a hotplug event.
	Those two changes are complementary, even an application that
would track interface by ifindex would sometime needs to know about
ifname change. My assumption is that most apps would still use ifname
for a long while to be backward compatible with older kernels.
	The kobject framework is well designed, so adding these
features is trivial change and won't run the risk of breaking anything
(famous last words). Obviously, hotplug apps are free to ignore those
additional features.
	Patch for 2.6.20 is attached. The patch was tested on a system
running the hotplug scripts, and on another system running udev.
	Have fun...
	Jean
