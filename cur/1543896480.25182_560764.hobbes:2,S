Well, only if you use the most restrictive permissions. And then you'll
suddenly hit failure cases which you didn't expect to, which can
possibly cause another exploit to become visible.

AA is supposed to allow valid access patterns, so for non-buggy apps +
policies, the rename will be fine and does not change the (observed)
permissions.
The time window in the rename+relabel approach however introduces a slot
where permissions are not consistent. This is a different case.

SELinux is superior to AA for a certain scenario of use cases; as we can
see here, it is not superior to AA for _all_ use cases.

A veto is not a technical argument. All technical arguments (except for
"path name is ugly, yuk yuk!") have been addressed, have they not?
