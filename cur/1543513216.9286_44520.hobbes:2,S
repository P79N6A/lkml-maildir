Hi!
Sometimes (1 time out of 30-40) initialization of my 3c509b card fails and
dmesg reports the following errors:
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, BNC port, address  00 60 08 52 6d 2b, IRQ 10.
3c509.c:1.16 (2.2) 2/3/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov.
eth0: Setting Rx mode to 1 addresses.
eth0: transmit timed out, Tx_status 00 status 2000 Tx FIFO room 1536.
eth0: transmit timed out, Tx_status 00 status 2000 Tx FIFO room 1536.
eth0: transmit timed out, Tx_status 00 status 2000 Tx FIFO room 1536.
eth0: transmit timed out, Tx_status 00 status 2000 Tx FIFO room 1536.
eth0: transmit timed out, Tx_status 00 status 2000 Tx FIFO room 1536.
The last errors just keep repeating every now and then and I'm unable to use
the network (However the IP is set). This happens  *only* on
initialization, it *never* happens during normal operation.
Kernel is 2.2.12.
