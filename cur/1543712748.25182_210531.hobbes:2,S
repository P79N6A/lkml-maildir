If you are taking your samples over time, that shouldn't matter...  if 
the system workload is such that you are hitting the drive cache the 
majority of the time, you're not being "fooled" by cache hits, the patch 
would be taking those cache hits into account.
If the system isn't hitting the drive cache the majority of the time, 
statistical sampling will automatically notice that too...
