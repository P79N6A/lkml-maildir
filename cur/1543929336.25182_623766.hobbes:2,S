Hi,
The UML code sits in io_getevents waiting for an event to be submitted
and completed.  This is a case I completely overlooked when putting
together the referenced patch.
We could check ctx->reqs_active before scheduling to determine whether
or not we are waiting for I/O, but this would require taking the
context lock in order to be accurate.  Given that the test would be
only for the sake of book keeping, it might be okay to do it outside
of the lock.
Zach, what are your thoughts on this?
