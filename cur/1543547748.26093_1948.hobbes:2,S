No I don't agree. There are other areas where fast progress is by far
more
desirable then inside the kernel - PLEASE KEEP THE KERNEL dev. slow - 
which in the practice automatically translates into STABILITY of
interfaces ;-).
What's only needed fast are just device drivers.
I don't care whatever it takes 2 or 3 years between major kernel
releases - even this is twice the freq of NT updates already!
