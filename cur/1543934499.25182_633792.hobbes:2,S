{sas|fc}_remove_host is called before scsi_remove_host. And in
srp_remove_work(), we call srp_remove_host and then
scsi_remove_host. ibmvscsi also calls them in that order.
I thought that I messed up something in srp_transport_class. But I
can't figure out what's wrong. The above patch works and is unlikely
to lead to critical problems so I'm fine with it for now.

Yeah, it should be fixed.
