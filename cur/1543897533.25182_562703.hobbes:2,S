Right; what I'm saying is that we don't do any checks on array sizes at
all, mostly since nobody is brave enough to deal with VLAs (which we'll
have to do if we start doing that).

With == it would be a different bug ;-)
BTW, VLA can be not just auto variable - it can be used in derivation of
such (i.e. you can say int (*p)[n], just not for anything not in block
or prototype scope).  And $DEITY help us[1] when ({...}) comes into the
game, since it allows leaking types out of the scope they'd been
declared in...
[1] or gcc - it gets an ICE galore in that class of testcases
