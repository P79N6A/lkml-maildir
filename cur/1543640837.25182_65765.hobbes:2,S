There is no '1-1-1' case, the case is '1-1-1-pause'. Only after the pause 
would the software (may it be kernel or user-space) know that and what 
character has been meant. At the '1-1-1' state the user might press again a 1 
and then wait, then this might be an '1-pause' case.
The idea is that in the case of '1-1-1-pause' the driver queues exactly one 
character, e.g. the "c".

See 1. The app doesn't see that this key has been hit three times.

When the driver would send Backspaces, then yes. Otherwise not.
So we both agree that sending backspaces from a cell-phone-like keyboard 
driver is a bad thing :-)
