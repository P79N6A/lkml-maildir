   Now, what do you think about starting to use a new quota.user/quota.group
   format in 2.3, which will be both endian independent and will use 64bit
   values for timestamps in it (ie. change similar to old/new swap style)?
   It would probably not need many kernel changes in dquot.c.
Sounds like a good idea.  I didn't know the quota changes were arch
independent, or I would have argued for making this change before 2.2.  
We may need to think about the capatibility issues here; for example, do
we make the kernel understand both formats and automatically determine
whether to use the old format or the new format.  We want to make the
upgrade seamless for the user.  (For example, once we get the format
decided on, we may want to backport support to the 2.2 kernels, so that
users can switch freely between 2.3 development kernels and 2.2 kernels,
and later between 2.2 and 2.4 kernels without losing because of quota
file incompatibilities.)
