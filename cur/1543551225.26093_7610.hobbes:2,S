Hello,
I am writing a /proc interface to the ethernet bonding driver and had the
following questions:
1) Why does a slave interface need an IP address? Isn't it sufficient if
slave->flags is set to IFF_UP|IFF_RUNNING ?
2) What happens if the MTU of differnet slave devices are different? How
does one choose the MTU of the master? Minimum of the MTU of all slaves?
3) Where in /proc would one put the bonding driver? /proc/net/bondNNN? 
TIA,
