yes, i picked it up from -mm (as can be seen from the SOB line), and i 
agreed with that change regardless of the reiser4 patchset. (which might 
never see the light of upstream acceptance)
there's nothing more annoying than incomplete and inconsistent APIs. I'm 
trying to fix them up everywhere i see, and this is one of those cases. 
Adrian still has not given any rationale about why he wants to see the 
export removed.
