I really see the two issues at hand as being very much orthogonal to
each other.
Namely, you put data on the stack when you need it in the local
'context' only, whereas you put data globally when it needs to be
available globally. The C++ references are nothing more than syntactic
sugar (and we all know what they say about that and semicolons) for
pointers, and so I don't see how they would affect the choices at all.
Choosing where the data goes should be done according to the data's
lifetime, not the specifics of how functions are declared.
