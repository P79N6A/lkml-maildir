Subject: unkillable process in R state?

I have a process (an instance of a find command) that seems to be unkillable (ie
kill -9 <pid> as root doesn't work).
Top shows it's status as R.
Is there anything I can do to kill the thing? It's taking up all unused cpu
cycles (currently at 97.4%).
Thanks,
Chris
