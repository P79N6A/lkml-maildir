So when you set an address on an interface that address is recognised
as belonging to the local machine. That's fine. That's what we
expect from 2.0

So, as soon as the interface has a mask or p-t-p you get a route.
That's not what we expect from 2.0 and leads to confusion. As soon
as you config an interface you can't avoid getting a route entry
you might not have wanted (see my future message for some reasons
and problem), but you can't avoid it without deleting or downing
the interface.
