Subject: smatch results for 2.5.66

The 2.5.66 results for smatch are up on kbugs.org
Sadly, I haven't changed any of the scripts since 
2.5.65.  I did get some work done on the gcc part
but it turns out there is a problem and I had to 
revert to diff-smatch-v.42 to compile the kernel. :(

As you can see, there were bug fixes all everywhere.  :)

where kernelver = "2.5.65" or kernelver = "2.5.66"

That's 332 bugs fixed.  :)
