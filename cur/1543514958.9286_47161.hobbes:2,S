We all know what Turing-complete is. Turing-complete is just the CPU 
though. What about ports, devices, user feedback? Let's call that
"host-complete". For host-completeness on Linux you have to support at
least the essential syscalls. I believe there are a few that are
derived, i.e. can be built with others. Well, I got about 105 of them
in pforth, which is descended of my old flame, JForth for the Amiga,
via 3DO. write works, I think geteuid works, but I can't begin to
check all of them. They only add about 16k to the C-compiled pforth
kernel, but they represent most of the functionality of Linux. Really,
it's probably more bugs than non-bugs, but it demonstrates linking
syscalls into an existing Forth.
sysforth.tgz is in   
ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/cLIeNUX/interim
right next to libsys.
pforth is pretty lucid code, and it doesn't have many libc dependancies,
so a libc-less build is concievable. Then all that's needed for an 
all-Forth userspace that's a complete OS is gcc rewritten in Forth,
which is Left As An Excercize To The Reader   ;o)
pforth is public domain, and so is this release of "sysforth". Further 
work on this by me will be non-free-ified into my distro, so grab it now
if such things interest you. My understanding is that an author can't
release his right to normal authorship aknowledgement, but all other
rights I have in sysforth are released.
Sorry about the topic skew, but since this creates a useable and 
versatile system at about 200k over the size of the kernel itself 
I think it pertains.
