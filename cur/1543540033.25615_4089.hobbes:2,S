IMHO, if we're going to "standardize" a place to put kernel sources I
really dislike /lib/<anything>.  My own preference would be
/usr/local/linux.  Linus doesn't like /usr/src/linux so that's probably
dead.  /lib doesn't seem like the right place; /usr/local looks like the
best fit for a standard place.
