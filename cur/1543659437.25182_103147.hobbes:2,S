Hm, that single changeset only modified the ehci driver, which should
not bother your USB mouse at all, unless it's a USB 2.0 mouse :)
It looks like from your logs that the usb core saw a bunch of devices.
What does /proc/bus/usb/devices look like after booting, when your mouse
is not working?  The log also shows that a usb mouse was found by the
hid driver and bound to it, so I don't know why it wouldn't be working.
thanks,
