Hello,
I have an ASUS A7V133 (VIA VT8363A) with 5 PCI slots
and I installed kernel 2.4.4.
All runs fine when I only use PCI slots 1 to 3.
When I use slots 4 or 5, the system
freezes when data is passed to a device in one of
these slots. I tested with a Promise Ultra100, an Intel
Etherexpress Pro 100, and a DEC EtherWorks.
The problem does not turn up in 2.4.0 and 2.2.18 (standard
kernels from SuSE 7.1). I reproduced the error in a second
simillar system with the same motherboard.
Maybe this information is usefull...
If someone wants to know more details, please email me
