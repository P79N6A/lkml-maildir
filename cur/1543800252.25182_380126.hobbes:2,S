Hiya,
I'm using the 2.6.14.5 kernel and i notice that the system freezes
sometimes, within 24 hours usually, a total freeze, no mouse/keyb
reaction. Also i notice that apps crash randomly sometimes.
What can i do to investigate this ?
(none of the above problems occur when windows XP pro is used)
Thanks
