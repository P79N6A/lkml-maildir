No... I grab a page in kernel space and use it as an array. One problem is
that if an exit occurs, I have to be able to discard all attached objects
after the process's VM has been cleaned up (ie: what if it gets swapped
out?). Plus, mmap can clobber existing mappings, MapViewOfFile can't.

Small structures private to my Win32 module.

"Most"...
It'd mean adding extra fields into struct file (and possibly struct inode)
just for the use of this module (which probably wouldn't be accepted).

No. the extra data has to be accessible from CreateFile (potentially running
in other processes), and this'd mean it'd have to go speculatively searching
all Win32 handle tables currently in use.

So what? This is for a WINE accelerator/Win32 module only. There's already
been an argument over making the whole lot available as general Linux
functionality, but most people said that it'd be a bad idea because it'd not
be portable.

Consider the following:
	WAITER 1	WAITER 2	WAITER 3	WAKER
	wait-on-event	wait-on-event	wait-on-event
	sleep		sleep		sleep
							PulseEvent
							set-event
							wake(WAITER 1)
							wake(WAITER 2)
							wake(WAITER 3)
							reset-event
	wake		wake		wake
	what-happened?	what-happened?	what-happened?
	nothing!	nothing!	nothing!
	sleep		sleep		sleep
All three waiters should wake up with a note that the event triggered, but
they don't. Plus a fourth waiter who begins to wait on the event after the
set-event is issue probably shouldn't wake up.

No... there's no way to pass this to poll (or select).
Better to add a WaitForMultipleObjects() syscall and have that call
do_select() with a flag.
