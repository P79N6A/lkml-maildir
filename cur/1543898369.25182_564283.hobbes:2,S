Do some of your branches miss the commit by which it was removed?
(It was removed in df30b1171714bbf0e55ffe02138be4b8447e4235)
Than it will reappear every time you switch to a branch which still has
the file.
It is somewhat unclear what "reappear" means, though: do you mean
in your working directory (that's what I explained above) or do you
mean: on the commit pointed by HEAD?
In that second case I can only suspect that all your branches point
at the same commit, which is just before the one the file was removed
in...
