| It should be easy to place the counters in appropriately close
| memory if linux gets good NUMA APIs built on top of the topology
| services. If we extend kmem_cache_alloc() to allocate memory
| in a particular NUMA node, we could simply do this for placing the
| counters -
| ...
| This would put the block of counters corresponding to a CPU in
| memory local to the NUMA node. If there are more sophisticated
| APIs available for suitable memory selection, those too can be made
| use of here.
|
| Is this the kind of thing you are looking at ?
I'm no NUMA person so I can't verify your code snippet but if it does
what you say, yes, that is exactly what I meant:  We may have to deal
with both cache coherence and placement of counters in local memory.
