Well, there are other things outside the actual driver code that may change, and
that would make it harder to keep my patch in sync.
And actually, I submitted my patch some time ago to the maintainer of the driver
(Pauline Middelink.) Unfortunately, it never made it into the kernel, nor did I
get any feedback from her. I have no idea if she is still active (she is listed
as maintainer at least until 2.6.17.) I cc'ed her on this mail.
