  Will the change to io.h needed to support 2Gigs of RAM be submitted to 
  Linus soon?  We are eager to move to 2.2 (over 150 machines), but need 
  to have that fix in place.  To refresh your memory, the fix I am talking
  about is this one (quoting a message from Leonard Zubkoff):
Linus considers this fix incorrect due to a hack that allows __io_virt to be
applied both to legacy ISA addresses and ioremap'ed PCI ones.  The
documentation in page.h will be updated to indicate that the setting 0x70000000
for PAGE_OFFSET is not allowed.  If you set PAGE_OFFSET to 0x80000000 you will
get nearly the full 2GB and the __io_virt hack will still work.
