You are not alone.  Several BP6 users are reporting APIC error
interrupts, some with 0x02, some with 0x08.  You see the messages in
2.3.x but not 2.2.x because the debugging messages were only added in
2.3.20.  I suspect that if you ported the code for smp_error_interrupt
from 2.3.33 back to 2.2.x then you would see the same messages.  Nobody
seems to know if this is a real hardware bug with the BP6 (if it is, it
is a common one) or if there is some error in programming the APIC.
"Maciej W. Rozycki" <macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl> mailed a patch to l-k earlier
today which changes the APIC timing, search recent l-k archives for
get_8254_timer_count.  I plan to test that patch tommorow on 2.3.33,
see if it fixes the BP6 problems.
