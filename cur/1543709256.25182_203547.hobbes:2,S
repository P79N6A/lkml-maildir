I think, e.g. the code that calls audit_get/putname is still there.

Oops, I wasn't clear re: the static initialized data...I just meant to
give a couple examples, there were more:
+static int         audit_default = 0;
+static int         audit_pid = 0;
+static int         audit_rate_limit    = 0;
+static int         audit_freelist_count = 0;
etc...
thanks,
