I'm fairly sure that OpenAFS or other AFS clients will need to make use 
of
this when they move to the kernel keyring system.  I had a discussion 
with
Jeffrey Hutzelman on this topic a couple days ago on OpenAFS-Devel.  The
OpenAFS cache manager would want to call into userspace to convert 
between
Kerberos and AFS tickets/tokens.
