So _automate_ that then.  If you have so many workstations, make
a program/script that fix /etc/fstab.  Perhaps as simple as appending
a new line with the new fs to mount.  Put the program one some fs
already mounted on the clients, then ssh to each and run it.
The ssh part may be automated too, of course.

Most ways have their own disadvantages.  Can you invent a better concept
than the inode that works as well in every existing way, and better for
this case?  Your new syscall isn't it, as Pavel Machek demonstrated.
Changing unix is doable _if_ you can show a significant benefit.
The more utilities you want to break, the more benefit you need to show.
I don't think you can send the inode to the land of 
"8-char limited passwords" by pushing "simpler management of fstabs"
though.
