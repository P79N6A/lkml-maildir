I run linux 2.4.2-ac24 on the ULTRA 100 card with pdc 20267 Chip.
Drives are MAXTOR 53073H4 UDMA100.
Everything runs fine so far. The only thing which iritates me is
that :
/proc/ide/pdc202xx reports that the drives run in UDMA4 mode.
I have the above mentioned drives running as master each as a single
drive on its interface. 
How can I achive that the drives run in UDMA5 ?
