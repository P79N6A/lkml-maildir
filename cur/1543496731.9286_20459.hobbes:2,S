It depends on the country. In most parts of the world if the name has already
been used or is well known then it cannot be trademarked.

There is no such thing as an international trademark. On the other hand since
Linus owns the US, AT and ES trademarks on the product and since it was 
shipped commercially since before 1994 it shouldnt be a big deal to squash
it, especially if the brazillian linux community as a whole files complaints
en masse.
