I think the queue IDs of different subsystem need not to be exclusive.
The subsystem can allocate queue IDs arbitrarily. If one queue ID is
shared between several subsystems, corresponding probing will be
serialized. This will slow down the probing unnecessarily, but there
will be no race condition.
The benefit of the mechanism is that the maximum parallelism of probing
can be control.

Maybe.

I know nothing about FireWire. If I say something nonsense, please just
ignore it.
Whether is it possible that a new unit is inserted during probing
kthread is running. If it is possible, the probing kthread maybe ignore
the new inserted unit. So a kthread for this new unit should be created
upon inserting. And there must be some synchronization mechanism
provided. So, I think something like probing queue may be better than
raw kthread for this. And the bus scanning thread may need to exist
during system running, using the probing queue the bus scanning thread
can be created and destroyed on demanded too.
Thank you very much for your comment.
