Looks safe to me - we initialise all the fields in the xfs_buf_t
when we allocate out of the slab, so it doesn't really matter what
state the buffer is in when we free it.
OTOH, all other buffers are supposed to be locked when under I/O.
This change makes a special case for the log buffers, and I'd prefer
not to have to remember that this behaviour changed fo log buffers
at some point in time.
I suggest that adding:

To lock the buffer should be added here. That way we don't change
any semantics of the code at all.

And this assert can then stay...
Cheers,
