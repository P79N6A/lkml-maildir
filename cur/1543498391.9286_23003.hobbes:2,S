Why would it? All it would require is for each interface type to add a
SymLink to /dev/cd (and the vaarious other drive types) pointing to
/dev/`me`/cd and it works fine, as the normal directory mechanisms
handle the rest.
 Q> # ls -l /dev/cd | sed 's/        //'
 Q> lrwxrwxrwx   1 root    9 Apr 29 14:53 ide -> ../ide/cd
 Q> lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   13 Apr 29 14:53 parport -> ../parport/cd
 Q> lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   12 Apr 29 14:53 pcmcia -> ../pcmcia/cd
 Q> lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   10 Apr 29 14:53 scsi -> ../scsi/cd
 Q> #
Just add similar virtual symlinks for each type of drive supported.
Best wishes from Riley.
