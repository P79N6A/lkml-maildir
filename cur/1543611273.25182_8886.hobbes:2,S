This is a common question I think. Try looking for the following in
drivers/pci/pci.c:
#define PCI_OP(rw,size,type) \
int pci_##rw##_config_##size (struct pci_dev *dev, int pos, type value) \
{                                                                       \
	[ ... ]
}
PCI_OP(read, byte, u8 *)
PCI_OP(read, word, u16 *)
PCI_OP(read, dword, u32 *)
PCI_OP(write, byte, u8)
PCI_OP(write, word, u16)
PCI_OP(write, dword, u32)
