	I went to the Mandrake web site looking for updates. I must
admit that I'm not very familiar with it (I use Debian), but I could
not find any mention of this very important bug and the init scripts
packages are supposed to correct other unrelated bugs.
	Hum... I guess that either I should apply all update and cross
my fingers, or I should contact them...

	Yep, you were right on the spot. Too much memory in a PC can
be a disadvantage.

	Thanks again, Alan, you are a benediction ;-)

	Yes, that's what we did. I discover that there was a
ext2fs-undelete mini Howto which relate to that problem.
	Unfortunately, Alan was right. The files were not deleted, but
never written to the disk. So, when we were dumping the inodes, we
were getting only some junk. Too bad...
