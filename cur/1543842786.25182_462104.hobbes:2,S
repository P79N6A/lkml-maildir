And that's exactly what mmiowb() does right now -- it makes sure
the I/O ends up at some I/O hub that will keep the accesses in
order, before it allows the current CPU to continue.

MMIO-as-seen-by-its-target vs. whatever-the-cpus-that-originated-those-
I/Os-think-the-order-is, sure.
The CPU running the "mmiowb()" needs to make sure that the mmiowb()
finished before it allows another CPU to run code that does I/O to the
same device.  I thought (most of) this was automatic in Linux (except
for the difference between a CPU doing the access, and the I/O device
seeing it, which is what mmiowb() is meant to solve)?  Or are
we just safe from all kinds of similar issues, because driver code
tends to run under interrupt locks?
Aaaaaaaanyway...  the question of what to call mmiowb() and what its
exact semantics would become, is a bit of a side issue right now, let's
discuss it later...
