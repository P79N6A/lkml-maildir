That's an interesting, but very contrived, example.  Can you find a
single multi-threaded lib that uses FILE*'s shared with the
application using it?
Linus's suggestion to add hooks to pthread_create() gets around that
problem, anyway.  Alternatively, the multi-threaded library could
require any application linking to it to define _REENTRANT.
After all, it's silly to talk about a 'multi-threaded' library linked
to a 'single-threaded' application -- the application plus any
libraries, as a whole, are either multithreaded or not.  They have to
be on the same page to deal with *any* locking issues.
