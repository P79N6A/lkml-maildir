Ah...It seems I didn't explain enough.
Now, memorly-less-node has its own pgdat, for its own zonelist.
All *online* node has its own NODA_DATA(nid).
NOD_DATA(nid) is always valid pointer if a node is online.
NODE_DATA(nid)->present_pages can be 0 even if a node is online, 
I call this as memory-less-node.
Thanks,
