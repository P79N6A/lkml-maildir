Actually, this would be my argument _for_ Nick's approach.  It is simple
and we all understand it.
There are a _lot_ of scheduler changes in 2.6-mm, and who knows which
ones are an improvement, a detriment, and a noop?  It is like bandaids
on top of bandaids, to fix corner cases.
And we _do_ know what causes the problem: the interactivity estimator
misestimates interactivity.  What we do not know is what fixes it.
