Hereby I wish to announce Linux-kernel v2.0.40,
aka ``The Moss-covered Tortoise''.  This release fixes several remote
information-leaks, a few local exploits, possible group descriptor
corruption for ext2fs, a few network related issues, a few SUS/LSB
compliance issues, and various other minor changes.  A complete changelog
can be found at the same places the kernel itself can be downloaded.
This upgrade is of medium urgency, and is a recommended upgrade if you
experience problems.  This kernel is only maintained, not developed, and
hence, if you miss support for hardware/software or any feature, then
you should consider upgrading to either the latest v2.4.xx kernel or
the latest v2.6.xx kernel.
The kernel can be found at:
ftp.xx.kernel.org (where xx is your country-code)
Complete tarballs (compressed with gz and bzip2 respectively):
/pub/linux/kernel/v2.0/linux-2.0.40.tar.gz
/pub/linux/kernel/v2.0/linux-2.0.40.tar.bz2
As a patch to be applied on top of the v2.0.39 kernel-tree
(compressed with gz and bzip2 respectively):
/pub/linux/kernel/v2.0/patch-2.0.40.gz
/pub/linux/kernel/v2.0/patch-2.0.40.bz2
Note that some mirrors might not keep both compression-formats.
