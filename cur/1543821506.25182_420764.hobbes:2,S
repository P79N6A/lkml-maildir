You can control low level features in C++ even much better than in asm.
Just an example. You can be pretty sure that a function like this:
inline void f(const int& x)
{
}
would use the parameter you pass to it without doing a copy on the stack.
And that is not dependent on anything.
For example, I wrote a vector library to do math with SSE, and there it
is fundamental that you don't _ever_ write a xmm register to the stack or
to memory in temporary variables. Look like this:
class Vector {
    float   f[4];
    typedef float __vr __attribute__((__mode__(__V4SF__),__aligned__(16)));
    
    Vector operator+(const __vr that) const
    {
	return __builtin_ia32_addps(...);
    };
    Vector operator-(const __vr that) const
    {
	return __builtin_ia32_subps(...);
    };
    ...
};
