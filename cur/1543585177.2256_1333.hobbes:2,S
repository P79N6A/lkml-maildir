The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/
Release 0.9.4: Sun Mar 18 01:48:12 EST 2001
	* Move to hand-rolled LL parser for increased compilation speed.
	* Compile numbers as numbers (solves Giacomo's 0.9.3 bug).
The compilation-speed improvement is pretty dramatic -- factor of two.
As a happy side effect, this change cuts the line count of CML2 by
about 500 lines; the whole system is now 4874 lines of Python code.
The rules file in this version is current to 2.4.2.
