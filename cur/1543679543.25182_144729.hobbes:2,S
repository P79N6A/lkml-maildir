No thank you. 3.x is still broken enough that I don't want to force people 
to use it.

Who cares about m68k? Does it do the right thing on x86? gcc 3.2.2 does
not, it does a "call __udivdi3" + "call __umoddi3", which is a 64/64->64
thing, which is totally inappropriate, and about a million times slower 
than a single "udiv".
gcc is crap when it comes to long long. Always has been.
