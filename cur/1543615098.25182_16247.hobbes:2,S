When your SCSI driver crashes, their is no recovery save rebooting.
When your IDE driver crashes, their is no recovery save rebooting.
When your Ethernet driver crashes, their is no recovery save rebooting.

If a frame buffer device crashes, it's a bug in the frame buffer device driver
(unless the kernel got `tainted' by a user space application with root
 privileges that messed with the graphics card without the frame buffer device
 driver being aware of that).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
