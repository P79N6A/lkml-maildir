Users of gcc-3.x will need the attached patch _for gcc_ to compile an SH
kernel patched with preempt-kernel.  This is _not_ our fault, it is a
gcc bug and is now merged into CVS and should be part of gcc-3.1.
gcc-2.9x compiles without problem.  It is only 3.x versions that suffer
the bug.

P.S. Also of note: yes this works on Sega Dreamcast.  You can have a
fully preemptible Dreamcast.  Impress your friends.  Or something.
