I maintain the proposal I have given before:
<linux/abi/*.h> as the header file namespace;
<linux/*.h> <asm/*.h> namespaces reserved for compatibility (once the
migration is complete these are owned by the libc)
Types use the __kernel_* namespace *only*; structures use struct __kernel_*.
Some form of export of the expected syscall ABI as well as syscall
numbering.

I don't think the <linux/*.h> namespace as its currently laid out is
very functional for exporting ABIs, so I'd like to
A bigger issue is if this really should be done in C.  A worthwhile
thought: if this is done correctly then most or all of the 64/32 compat
code (or any other arch1-on-arch2 compatibility) should be able to be
automatically generated.  If not, it almost certainly isn't done
correctly...

Agreed.
