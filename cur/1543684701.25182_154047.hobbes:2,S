we are not using the Linux async i/o. Do you mean that? Or the flush which
the Linux kernel does from the file cache to the disk time to time on its
own? I assume it will write to the system log an error message if a disk
write fails?
The error 5 Shane reported came from a call of fsync(), and apparently he
also got that same 5 from a simple file read which CHECK TABLE in MyISAM
does.
Why would a write in the Linux async i/o fail? I am using aio on Windows,
and if the disk space can be allocated, it seems to fail only in the case of
a hardware failure.
