  Yes, OK.

  Ugh! Are you sure? For this path the buffer must be attached (only) to
the running transaction. But then how the commit code comes to it?
Somebody would have to even manage to refile the buffer from the
committing transaction to the running one while the buffer is in wbuf[].
Could you check whether someone does __journal_refile_buffer() on your
marked buffers, please? Or whether we move buffer to BJ_Locked list in
the write_out_data: loop? Thanks.
