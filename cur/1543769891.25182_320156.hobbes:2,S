How did you retrieve the TPM-aggregate?
I'm still not sure why exporting just the kernel measurement values via 
proc is useful.
Wouldn't you need to retrieve the measurement list atomically with the 
TPM-aggregate?
In which case, we'd need an interface which takes a nonce and returns the
kernel measurement list and the TPM-aggregate together.
Is the source of your example IMA attestation application available?
