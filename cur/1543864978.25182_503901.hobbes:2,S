That seems like the easy part - it seems like anyone bright enough to
write a working Linux driver would be good enough with their editor or
perl or bash to knock that out in 10 minutes.
I would think rules like "no new ioctls" and "no new /proc entries",
that might seem arbitrary to one who doesn't follow kernel
development, plus the occasionally insulting code reviewer, would be
more of an issue.
