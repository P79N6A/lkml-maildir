Hi all,
	The device driver for Eicon Diva does not support the Diva Pro 2.0
pci card AFAIK. In drivers/hisax/diva.c, the setup_diva checks for cards
with the following device ids : 0xe002, 0xe004, 0xe005
But the device id for Diva Pro 2.0 pci  is 0xe001. I would like to know
if there any patch available to support this device ??
Waiting in anticipation,
Bye,
prakash
