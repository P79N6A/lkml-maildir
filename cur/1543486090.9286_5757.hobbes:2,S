<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I actually never had the time to read any one of 
the emails I got from the linux-kernel. So, I didn't know about the instructions 
at the bottom. Thank you everybody who helped me out w/ this; getting 200 emails 
a day isn't my idea of fun. Somebody by the name of Jason Bratton had a lot of 
fun signing me up for it. I'm fairly new to the internet and don't know much 
about anything. I intend to issue him a severe beating tomorrow at school. Thank 
you everybody once again.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
