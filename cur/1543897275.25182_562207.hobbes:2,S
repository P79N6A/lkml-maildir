Do what anyone with a little bit of brain would do: publish it[1]!
Patenting it and using as defensive patent wont work. Unless
you are able to control Saurons Ring. If you want to know more
just read up on current patent practice. IEEE has quite a few
articles on that issue, i'm sure that ACM and the like should
have also a few.

[1] I know of at least one larger company here that stopped
issuing patents but publishes its developments in a local newspaper.
