Actually, its only wrong in queuecommand because that can be called in
softirq context.
Sleeping in the eh paths is fine (as long as you drop the locks that the
EH thread has uselessly taken for you).  Indeed it's often required
since the return is supposed to tell the eh thread whether the action
was successful or not.
