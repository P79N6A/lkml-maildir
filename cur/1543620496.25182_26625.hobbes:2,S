No, that's fine.
The problem which the comment refers to is: how to provide
per-process request batching without running off and creating
per-process reservation pools or such.
What I'm relying on is that when a sleeper is woken (at low-water),
there are at least (high-water - low-water) requests available before
get_request will again sleep.  And that the woken process will be
able to grab a decent number of those non-blocking requests. I
suspect it's always true, as long as (high-water - low_water) is
"much greater than" the number of CPUs.
The synchronous reader is well-behaved, and should be nicely
FIFO if we're getting low on requests.
