I like the idea and it would solve the concerns that we had. The encoding
of a bit in a pointer is weird but we have done that before in the
page_struct.
However, this also means that __run_timers will not free up the timer and
it has to be explicitly freed with del_timer_??. There may be code
that relies on not having to delete a single shot timer after it has been
fired.
