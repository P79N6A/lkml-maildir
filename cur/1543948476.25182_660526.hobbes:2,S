Subject: [PATCH 2/2] fix possible journal overflow issues

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
There are several cases where the running transaction can get buffers added to 
its BJ_Metadata list which it never dirtied, which makes its t_nr_buffers 
counter end up larger than its t_outstanding_credits counter.  This will cause 
issues when starting new transactions as while we are logging buffers we 
decrement t_outstanding_buffers, so when t_outstanding_buffers goes negative, 
we will report that we need less space in the journal than we actually need, so 
transactions will be started even though there may not be enough room for them.  
In the worst case scenario (which admittedly is almost impossible to reproduce) 
this will result in the journal running out of space.  The fix is to only 
refile buffers from the committing transaction to the running transactions 
BJ_Modified list when b_modified is set on that journal, which is the only way 
to be sure if the running transaction has modified that buffer.  This patch 
also fixes an accounting error in journal_forget, it is possible that we can 
call journal_forget on a buffer without having modified it, only gotten write 
access to it, so instead of freeing a credit, we only do so if the buffer was 
modified.  The assert will help catch if this problem occurs.  Without these 
two patches I could hit this assert within minutes of running postmark, with 
them this issue no longer arises.  Thank you,
