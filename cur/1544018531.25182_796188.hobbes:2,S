Ah, sorry. Thanks for debugging. Should just be a matter of sticking
a check for GFP_WAIT in there somewhere?
Thanks for pulling this in BTW (hopefully you don't see any more issues).
Your subsequent improvements all seem pretty nice to me too (although I
don't know the lockdep code well, but I didn't see any obviuos problems).
Thanks,
Nick
