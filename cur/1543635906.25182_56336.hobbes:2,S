	Yes, "hidden" has its own purpose which is limitted
usually to HA setups. Then Alexey proposed (from long time)
such ARP tricks to be controlled with hook(s)/rules. My ideas in
such direction resulted in "iparp" which is completed:
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/~julian/#iparp
	Its purpose is "tuning" of ARP (the kernel's use
only), not for security. For example, it can't deal with remote
replies.
	But at the same time I see David implements arptables.
May be now it is good time to ask:
	David,
	can you explain what kind of control will be
possible with arptables. For now, I see only filtering of
remote probes. As we know the clusters have different needs.
Can you draw a list of goals that will be achieved with
arptables and whether the 2 ARP requirements for clusters ("drop
probes to VIP" and the most needed "don't announce VIP in our
probes") will exist in arptables? The 3th requirement (used
from "hidden" to avoid problems with autoselecting VIP as src
IP can be easily solved in routing).
