No there's no problem there. I always register the correct interrupt
line (the one that is seen with lspci for example), without explicitly
requesting the number, but by using dev->irq after I've called
pci_enable_device()

Yep, and not only one I might add... But none of them is showing the
correct behaviour that a good driver should (in my humble opinion), and
the best efforts are for kernels 2.4
Anyway, thanks
