smb_rmb is enough in practice for x86 (in asm-i386), but not the right
barrier in general because rmb only serializes reads against reads, so
it would also make little sense while reading the i386 code. here you've
to serialize a write against a read so it would be misleading unless you
know exactly the lowlevel implementations of those barriers.
smp_mb() before the while loop should be the correct barrier for all
archs and the asm generated on x86 will be the same.
alpha, ia64 and x86-64 (and probably others) needs it too.
