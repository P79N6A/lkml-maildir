Hello Ben, Andrew, 
This patch helps me if I disconnect all USB peripherals before shutting
down notebook. With connected peripherals (USB mouse, PL2303
USB<->serial converter/port) - powering off process stops right after
unmounting filesystems but before hda power off ... 
There is a bug report for this too:
