It means that either you've got a struct file leak or something is playing
bad games with filp->private_data. In theory it may be any other subsystem
using the same field. IIRC tty code more or less blindly assumes that
meaningful value in private_data means that we have a tty-related struct
file. Potential candidates: AFFS, CODA(?), drivers/net/cosa.c(?), ISDN,
APM(?), MTRR(?). Do you have any of those beasts?
