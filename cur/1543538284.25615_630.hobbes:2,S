I don't think so.  For example of the algorithms used by the original
PGP, the RSA algorithm is patented in the US only, that is because they
published it before applying for a patent (in the US you can do that,
but not in the rest of the world AFAIK - they were trying to get it
published before the US govt blocked publication of strong encryption).
The IDEA algorithm however is patented world-wide.
We have enough stupidity in the US, we don't need any more being
incorrectly blamed on us. :-)
