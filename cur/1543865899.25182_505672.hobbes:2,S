One thing which can be solved at the tool level, particularly for 
netfilter, is to provide options for "turn it all of and I'll select," 
"turn it all on (or module)," and "reset this page to defaults." Because 
those starting points will cover a majority of the options. Useful for 
device drivers as well, particularly network cards and disk controllers, 
where there are a vast number of choices.
