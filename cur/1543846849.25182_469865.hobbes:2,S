which patch is to be applied first?
You failed to include an order, as described by 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
 and Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
Also, stuff like "hi Jeff" and "Thanks, Jan-Bernd" must be hand-edited 
out before patch application.  All comments not intended to be DIRECTLY 
copied into the kernel changeset description should follow the "---" 
separator.
