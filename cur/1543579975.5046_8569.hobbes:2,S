The email was not necessarily intended for you. You just pulled the pin.
There were people who made the suggestion that TCP should retry after a
RST because it "might be an anti-ECN path"

I dont agree that unknown format == reserved. I think it is bad design to
assume that. You may be forgiven if you provide the operator
opportunities to reset your assumptions via a config option.
It has nothing to do with a paranoia setting, just a bad design. Nothing
legit about that.

This is the way it's done with all protocols. or i should say the way it
used to be done. How do you expect ECN to be deployed otherwise?
The internet is a form of organized chaos, sometimes you gotta make
these type of decisions to get things done. Imagine the joy _most_
people would get flogging all firewall admins who block all ICMP.
There is nothing silly with the decision, davem is simply a modern day
internet hero.
