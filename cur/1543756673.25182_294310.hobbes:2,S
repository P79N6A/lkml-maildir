Personally, I think that the best approach to solving this problem is 
from the privileges aspect.  The ability to grant privileges to only set 
RT policy is just an example of a general need for granting limited 
privileges to a program and/or a user.  So a solution that involved a 
mechanism for granting a specified subset of root privileges to 
specified users when running specified programs would have wider 
application.
My limited understanding of SELinux (which may be mistaken) is that it 
provides a basic framework for this level of privilege control and 
perhaps the solution lies there.
