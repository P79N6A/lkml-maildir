"big-picture" should be in Documentation/swsusp.txt...
*Should* be :-(. I need to copy all used memory, to make sure my
snapshot is atomic.
Copying works by looking at what is allocated, counting needed pages,
allocating 'directory' for them, allocating memory for copies, and
actually copying.
When I suddenly find I have less data to copy than I thought, it
screws up the code.

Well, see the patch above. That seems to do the trick for
me. It seems that even "cold" allocation can give page from per-cpu
pool. I thought that was a bug?
