Actually I meant those caps to be more of a proof of concept than as a
really useful set, so I have nothing against CAP_REG_EXEC being
deleted.  However, it still performs one (small) function even in the
absence of suid/sgid executables: you can execute files with omde --x
which you can't do with mmap().  (Also, I'm not 100% sure the kernel
doesn't do some magic things on exec(), perhaps some magic forms of
accounting or whatever, which you couldn't do with mmap().)

Can a non-root user create limited-rights processes without assistance
from the sysadmin, under SElinux?  I was under the impression that it
wasn't the case.  Also, SElinux is immensely more difficult to
understand and operate with than a mere set of capabilities: and I
think that simplicity is (sometimes) of value.
