They are different concepts. Ack clears the event on the PIC, it's
tyically necessary for resetting the edge detection logic for edge
interrupts and has to happen before the handler is called.
On MPIC or XICS, this is implicit by reading the vector. On some more
dumb controllers, this has to be done explicitely.
EOI is a more "high level" thing that some "intelligent" PICs that
automatically raise the priority do to restore the priority to what it
was before the interrupt occured.
