Did he work for Maxtor, by any chance?  :-/
A disk drive whose power is cut needs to have enough residual power to 
park its heads (or *massive* data loss will occur), and at that point it 
might as well keep enough on hand to finish an in-progress sector write.
There are two possible sources of onboard temporary power: a large 
enough capacitor, or the rotational energy of the platters (an 
electrical motor also being a generator.)  I don't care which one they 
use, but they need to do something.
