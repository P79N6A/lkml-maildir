Hi,
actually, I have prepared patches to split the USBHID code in two parts - 
generic HID, which could be hooked by transport-specific HID layers (USB, 
Bluetooth). 
I did not send them to lkml/linux-usb, as they are quite big (mainly 
because a lot of code is being moved around). I am currently trying to 
setup a git repository on kernel.org, hopefully kernel.org people will 
react, so that the patches could be easily put into git repository and be 
available for rewiew and easy merge. After that, they are planned to be 
merged either into Greg's or Andrew's tree. I can send them to you if you 
want.
Do you think that you could wait a little bit more, after the split has 
been done? (it's currently planned approximately after 2.6.20-rc1). It 
seems to me that your patches will apply almost cleanly on top of the 
split patches (you will have to change the pathnames, of course).
Thanks,
