You are still able to disable it by editing the Kconfig file.
And even if the option will no longer be present at some time in the 
future, it will be trivial to disable it in the Makefile.
But currently (an option depending on EXPERIMENTAL) the testing coverage 
isn't that big, and with this -mm patch, most people using -mm [1] will 
have it enabled and notice if other problems pop up.
