These benefits should be quantified, please.  Also any benefits to any
other workloads should be identified and quantified.
The whole approach seems wrong to me.  The kernel lost track of these
pages and then we run around post-facto trying to fix that up again. 
Please explain (for the changelog) why the kernel cannot get this right
via the usual sharing, refcounting and COWing approaches.
