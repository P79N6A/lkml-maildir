man 2 open
	O_APPEND
		The file is opened in append mode. Initially, and

		at the end of the file, as if with lseek.
Things don't often mean what they seem to say. You can lseek for
various reads in a file opened for append. However, the explicit
definitition requires that any writes occur at the end of the file.
You need to open the file as O_RDWR if you want to do random read/writes.
As a feature, this allows you to make sparse files as well.
