The bootloader or mkinitrd typically tells the kernel what the root disk 
is, so that's not a big deal.  The boot disk, OTOH, is tough.  Right 
now, we just assume the sysadmin knows what's he's doing, when he 
installs lilo or grub on a disk.  You care about the boot disk when 
installing lilo... maybe there are similar situations too which I do not 
recall.  As Alan said, besides EDD (only on newer boxes) there's really 
nothing.
