Please don't confuse character set with character encoding.  The
problem we are talking about here is about character encoding.
Once upon a time the two were muddled; that's why MIME and HTTP use
"charset" to mean character encoding.
And the answer is: yes, you can store it wherever you want :)

It's not a font problem.  XMMS simply displays each byte as a separate
character because that's what it assumes it should do.  No font will fix that.
