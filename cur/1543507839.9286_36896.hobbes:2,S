Talk to Peter Anvin. He's doing this 32-bit bootloader thing that can
actually do a complete re-link, and essentially give you all the
advantages of modules with none of the disadvantages (ie no runtime
overhead in the TLB etc).
He also has an extremely cool splash-screen right now. Whether he's ready
to release yet or not is another matter.
