Is that (oops possibility on i386) really true? (.exit.{text, data}) is also
between __init_begin and __init_end and hence will be discarded
_along_ with (not before) .init.{text, data} during run-time I think,
which means .init -> .exit reference modpost warnings (on said
archs) are truly bogus ...

Yup, we were only discussing possibility that modpost not complain
about .init -> .exit references that will never go oops (because the arch
guarantees that).
