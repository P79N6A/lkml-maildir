Sorry for the delayed response. This is still very mysterious to me..
Do you see anything interesting in dmesg after you try this ac adapter unplug and plug back routine? Can you send me the dmesg. Better still open a bugzilla at bugme.osdl.org and stick the dmesg and acpidump there.
One possible reason for this is, somehow idle statistics is getting all wrong and ondemand thinks CPU is busy, even though it is idle. I have seen this happening earlier when there are issues with local APIC interrupts in deep C-states on dual core systems. But, here it is a single core CPU. Right? Can you also get the output of
#cat /proc/interrupts; sleep 10; cat /proc/interrupts
On your system when ondemand is not working and when it is working (After your unplug-plug workaround.
Thanks,
