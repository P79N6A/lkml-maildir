It's simple if it's synchronous.  When I discussed this a while
back with the LVM and EVMS developers the consensus was that an
async API would be better - so we'd need some sort of completion
cookie or callback or whatever.
It would end up with almost as much state as the rather amazing
`struct dio'.
Of course, one could do a synchronous API and see if anyone really,
really complains ;)  But a bit of requirements-gathering would be
needed before getting in and coding it.
