a similar issue happens with the disable-cap-mlock, but it gives only
mlock to the guy with fs-level fsuid = 0 access, so the security
implications are greatly lower, no way to do anything really bad with
just access to mlock (DoS is the very worst scenario, and it's not very
different from swapoff -a anyways, or again not very different from
filling the swap enterely as far as security is concerned).
