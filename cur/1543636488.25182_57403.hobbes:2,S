So you can't do it: if this user can't get more memory neither root.

I explicitely mentioned above, "make sure you don't hit any resource

I had my [not finished] own non-overcommit patch based on Eduardo
Horvath's from 2000, no need to explain what it means :) Actually the
basics of your patch looks very similar to Eduardo's one.

And my point (you asked for comments) was that, this is only (the
harder) part of the solution making Linux a more reliable (no OOM
killing *and* root always has the control) and cost effective platform
(no need for occasionally very complex and continuous resource limit
setup/adjusting, especially for inexpert home/etc users).
