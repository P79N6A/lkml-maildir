Against my better judgment I'm going to send this again as I have been having problems with a 
particularly faulty mail server randomly blackholing outgoing mail and I have not seen this in the 
archives after about 20 hours. Apologies if this arrives twice. I have temporarily subscribed to the 
list.

Nup, all seated fine and working perfectly well (and I mean raid-5 across all 10 disks and spraying
data at maximum PCI speed for 8 hours at a time well) with 2.6.5, and they are Supermicro cables
SATA cables with a pair of 5 bay Supermicro Hotswap bays so the quality is pretty good.

I hadn't, but I just gutted the system and did a heap of card shuffles.. it ain't that.

Nup, but it's always appears to be on the 3rd card. Pull one of the cards and it's sweet.

I hadn't, but I have now :p)
Under all these circumstances, 2.6.5 would boot fine. These tests were done with 2.6.5 and the patch
you supplied me.
I can even pull all the drives from boards 1&2 (drives 0-7) and it will lock hard on drive 8.
If I pull the 3rd card then it all behaves perfectly no matter what I do to it. I have relocated the
3rd card in other slots to change the detection order and it always *seems* to die on the 3rd
initialised card, no matter what slot.
Strange, No?
