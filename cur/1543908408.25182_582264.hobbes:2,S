One thing that we could do here is have notify_change check
attr->ia_valid after the setattr operation returns. If either ATTR_KILL_*
bit is set then BUG(). The helper function already clears those bits
so anything using it should automatically be ok. We'd have to fix
up NFS and a few others that don't implement suid/sgid.
This is not as certain as changing the name of the inode operation. It
would only pop when someone is attempting to change a setuid/setgid
file on these filesystems. Still, it should conceivably catch most if
not all offenders. Would that be sufficient to take care of everyone's
concerns?
