loops_per_sec is needed to time inter processor interrupt waits, this cannot
be handled with udelay. The IPI needs to wait a roughly constant time,
because other CPUs can turn off interrupts while accessing some external 
hardware (like some intelligent RAID controllers), which does not get 
faster, even though the IPI wait runs faster.
