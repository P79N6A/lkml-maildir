You mean, just like the existing loopback device?  You can already do
this, and mount supports it today: you could do 
      mount -o loop imghda5 /mnt/hda5
for example and the loopback device would be set up automatically.

Unfortunately this goes completely against all unix permission checking
semantics.  There is absolutely no support for anything like this inside
Linux right now.

If you really need that, the way to do it would be through the VFS, by
implementing a new filesystem type.  Do you _really_ need it that much?
If so, then the stackable filesystem templates would probably be a good
place to start.
