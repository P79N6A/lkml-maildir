Subject: [PATCH] Updates to nfsroot documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The difference between ip=off and ip=::::::off has been a cause of much
confusion.  Document how each behaves, and do not contradict ourselves
by saying that "off" is the default when in fact "any" is the default
and is descibed as being so lower in the file.
