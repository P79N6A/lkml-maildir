Hello,
  Is there any way to disable write caching for disks in kernel? I just
want read caching. That's because I have a computer somewhere that crashes
kinda often because of power outages :)
 P.S. There is noting wrong with the eql ( I wrote an e-mail a while ago
), actually it works best :) ...
