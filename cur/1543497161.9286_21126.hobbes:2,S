You may want to look at
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/podfuk/podfuk.html;
 then
implement your filesystem of choice into mc and have it magically into
kernel. ln -s '/overlay/#execme:echo%32$HOME' mbin should be well
doable even with unpatched kernel.
Probably one line hack with sfs ;-).
You really don't want such work to go into kernel; instead create
userland filesystem and do things there.
