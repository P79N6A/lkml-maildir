Subject: [PATCH 5/9] VT binding: Update documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/18/126

Update Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt and Documentatin/console/console.txt to
reflect the following changes:
1. sysfs attributes are relocated to /sys/class/vtconsole
2. feature is selectable in Kconfig
3. add sample scripts to fbcon.txt

+
+	cat /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/name
+	(S) VGA+
+
+	    '(S)' stands for a (S)ystem driver, ie, it cannot be directly
+	    commanded to bind or unbind
+
+	    'VGA+' is the name of the driver
+
+	cat /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/name

+	    In this case, '(M)' stands for a (M)odular driver, one that can be
+	    directly commanded to bind or unbind.
+
+     3. uevent - ignore this file
 
 When unbinding, the modular driver is detached first, and then the system
 driver takes over the consoles vacated by the driver. Binding, on the other
 hand, will bind the driver to the consoles that are currently occupied by a
 system driver.
 
+NOTE1: Binding and binding must be selected in Kconfig. It's under:
+
+Device Drivers -> Character devices -> Support for binding and unbinding
+console drivers
+
+NOTE2: If any of the virtual consoles are in KD_GRAPHICS mode, then binding or
+unbinding will not succeed. An example of an application that sets the console
+to KD_GRAPHICS is X.

 How useful is this feature? This is very useful for console driver
 developers. By unbinding the driver from the console layer, one can unload the
 driver, make changes, recompile, reload and rebind the driver without any need
