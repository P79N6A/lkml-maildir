Guys,
I actually disabled the AGP bus entireley to prevent the mapping of a 64mb 
aperature when I recompiled. So did the BIOS update help you gents at all?
The 
only thing it allows me to do now is Enable the ACPI SRAT and ACPI APIC
without 
the computer hanging. Although now, I am having USB bus IRQ conflicts and
the 
MB still won't correctly allocate resources.
Cheers,
-Brian
