Untill the V century north of french and britain were almost
the same culture, and same people.
More antically they were both celt people, one
talking pimp dialect the other talking coic dialect.
(pimp and coic are the same word "five",
latin quinque, from whom italian and gallo-romance, greeck pente. it is
the same work,
where labiovelar qw has been changed from indueuropean to different
consonants, latin conserved them greeck changed to p, and so on).
