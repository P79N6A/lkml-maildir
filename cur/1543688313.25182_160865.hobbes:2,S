 Hello Ville.  Hello Stephan. :-)
 Your problem sounds very simlar to the problem we were suffering.
The problem was a spinlock deadlock inside drivers/char/random.c which
is used by tcp to generate random initial sequence number.  The bug
fix was checked into 2.4 tree on 28th July after the release of pre8
at 14th July.

    Changed EXTRAVERSION to -pre8
  TAG: v2.4.22-pre8

  [RANDOM]: Fix SMP deadlock in __check_and_rekey().
 This problem can happen on UP machine if the kernel is compiled with
CONFIG_SMP.  Because the offending routine is called only every five
minutes and it should receive a SYN packet while it's connecting, it
occurs rarely, but it happens when it happens.
 Please try 2.4.22.
P.S. This bug is a real headache.  We had many servers deployed and
they all randomly locked up about every two or four weeks.  I believe
people should be warned about this one.
