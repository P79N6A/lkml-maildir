really? how did you manage to do that? On a 2.4.0-test12-pre7 system I
cannot reproduce the behaviour you describe. I.e. at least
NR_RESERVED_FILES (which I agree with you should be increased!) are left
to superuser processes whilst the user processes are denied.
How exactly are you reproducing this? I wrote a simple while (1)
{open("/dev/null", 0); } program and run many instances of it as user. At
some stage user starts failing but superuser happily draws from the
freelist. Of course, the superuser cannot start complex programs which
require many descriptos but that is entirely the issues of
NR_RESERVED_FILES being too small on which I totally agree with you.
