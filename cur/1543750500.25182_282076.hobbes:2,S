Thats what I thought too Alan, after I'd connected the dots, so I 
turned the nonfatal exceptions off.  I'll give memtest86 another 
chance to break it sometime next week.  This is NOT ecc memory that I 
know of although I paid nearly $80 per half gig when I bought it last 
spring.  Theres a gig of it in here, and only two addresses were 
being reported, one in each bank.  If mapped directly, are those 
addresses even in that gig of ram?  Thats too big a hex number for my 
calculator.  Or is there a way to use the dmesg data to define that?
Dumb question, could this memory be on the video card?  Its an ATI 
9200SE 128 meg card, your basic $85 commodity card there days.
