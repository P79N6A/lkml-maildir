Hello.
I am needing to lock and unlock some user allocated virtual memory
within a kernel module. Unfortunatly, the mlock system call and
the it other friends in mlock.c are not exported as kernel symbols.
Are module writter ment to be able to do this? I can't think
of any reason why not. There does not seem to be any kernel symbol
that is intended for the task, am I missing something?
Thanks in advance.
Greg.
