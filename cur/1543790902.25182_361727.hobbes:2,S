Remember that Rohit is seeing ~10% variation between runs of scientific
software, and that his patch to use higher-order pages to preload the
percpu-pages magazines fixed that up.  I assume this means that it provided
up to 10% speedup, which is a lot.
But the patch caused page allocator fragmentation and several reports of
gigE Tx buffer allocation failures, so I dropped it.
We think that Mel's patches will allow us to reintroduce Rohit's
optimisation.

But yes, adding additional complexity is a black mark, and these patches
add quite a bit.  (Ditto the fine-looking adaptive readahead patches, btw).
