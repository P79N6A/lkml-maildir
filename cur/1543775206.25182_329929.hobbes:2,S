Hello,
I noticed a patch this AM to put the syscall_table in with read-only
data. I didn't save the patch, but I put the sys_call_table in
.section .rodata. System.map shows that it's there. Tests show that 
the sys_call_table, even though in the so-called R/O section can
still be written. Is there a special R/O section that will truly
prevent kernel (driver) code from writing?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
