Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9-rc2-mm2] Change irq.c driver to use new pci_dev_present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/23/283

This code previously used the pci_get_device function only to find out if the
device was present, it did not use the pci_dev* that was returned. That was
what the new pci_dev_present function was created for.  I was able to compile
and boot this code to show it did not break anything.
Please consider for inclusion.
