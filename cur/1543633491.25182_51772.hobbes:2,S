Still does that justify the overhead and the complications ?
Couldn't we provide for the worst case in a generic kernel
and make it a compile time option ?
If I understand you correctly, we even couldn't use kmalloc()
for allocating the buffers. IMHO you cannot expose that to
driver writers and hope to get a useful result.
So what are the alternatives ?
We could either use a bounce buffer or disable caching for the
page in question, which has its own set of problems.
