Hi,
Thank you very much too, for helping me.
Applied.
Had to kill klogd, since kernel generates tons of redirtied inode messages.
Size of the kern.log is 863 KB, thus I I don't think it is polite to attachit.
Don't know whenever it is ok to put it on pastebin too.
Anyway, it shows lots of redirtied inode... messages,
and while most of them are "at 08:02(sda2)" , my reiserfs root partition, some are
"Oct 22 14:50:27 MAIN kernel: [   73.643794] redirtied inode 2582 size 0 at 00:0f(tmpfs), line 300."
" line 300" is shown always
(I have /var/run, /var/lock, /dev mounted as tmpfs, default kubuntu setup)

	Maxim Levitsky
