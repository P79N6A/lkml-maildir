So this was some unrelated problem, and the hang occurs both with
and without "pci=routeirq"?

And you think the wondershaper oops was also unrelated to "pci=routeirq"?
Having to reorder wondershaper to avoid an oops doesn't sound like an
optimal solution.
So, if you don't have any problems you can blame on my patch, great!
And don't feel sorry; my change exposed several driver bugs, so I'm
glad for every testing report!
