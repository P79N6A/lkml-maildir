Subject: [PATCH 1/2] avoid OPEN_MAX in SCM_MAX_FD
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/13/74

The OPEN_MAX constant is an arbitrary number with no useful relation to
anything.  Nothing should be using it.  This patch changes SCM_MAX_FD to
use NR_OPEN instead of OPEN_MAX.  This increases the size of the struct
scm_fp_list type fourfold, to make it big enough to contain as many file
descriptors as could be asked of it.  This size increase may not be very
worthwhile, but at any rate if an arbitrary limit unrelated to anything
else is being defined it should be done explicitly here with:
	#define SCM_MAX_FD	255
Using the OPEN_MAX constant here is just confusing and misleading.
