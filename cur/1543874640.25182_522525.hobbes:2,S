MAX_NUMNODES == 1024 on IA64 and may be on x86_64 in the future.

Nack.
I would suggest you audit slab and make sure that we never fall back and 
always enter a slab on the node of page_to_nid(page). If 
all allocations use GFP_THISNODE then you should be safe and then we can 
remove the nodeid from the slab structure and simply use the available 
node information in the page struct.
