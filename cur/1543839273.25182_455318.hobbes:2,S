May be I'm overlooking something very obvious.  Please tell me, what
happens when a user hits a page fault and the page allocator is easily
able to give a page from its pcp list.  But container is over its limit
of physical memory.  In your patch there is no attempt by container
support to see if some of the user pages are easily reclaimable.  What
options a user will have to make sure some room is created.

I'm not arguing about that at all.  If people want to talk about
reclaiming kernel pages then that should be done independent of this
subject.
