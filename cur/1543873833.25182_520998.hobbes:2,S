> Virtual mmap allows holes in the same way as page tables do.
I don't want to take expensive TLB misses to lookup a page.
Don't force a virtual mapping solution down my throat if that
is not what I believe as a platform maintainer works best
for me.
TLB misses are extremely expensive on some platforms, that's why
I try to make all the critical structures go through the 4MB
locked TLB entry for the kernel image, or failing that the
4MB linear mappings at PAGE_OFFSET on sparc64.
