I had one of these drives fail recently with the dread "clicking of death"
sounds (while it was retrying reads).  What I discovered, while backing up
the disk, is that continuing sequential reads past the bad sectors without
and intervening operation would eventually cause the drive to get into a
messed up state where it erroneously reported the following good sectors
as bad.
My strategy to recover the good data was to read sequentially until I 
got an error, then explicitly seek to the next good sector and continue
from there.  This enabled me to copy the good data.
