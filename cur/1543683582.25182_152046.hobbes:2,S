OK.  Who are you and what have you done with the real Linus?
I guess it's back to fixing up reference counting in the rest of the
kernel.  It's not hard, it's just not done. 8(

A similar case.  At this point you don't have random users trying to
access things, so freeing is actually fairly safe (modulo other
bugs).
The kudzu one and Alan's USB firmware example bother me more: they
load then unload modules currently?  Since modern device drivers are
not supposed to fail to load just because there isn't currently
hardware, I guess they'd have to.
Oh well,
Rusty.
