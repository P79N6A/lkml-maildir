No. I don't agree. The MTRRs are set up by the BIOS because it knows the
hardware best (I know this is only true in theory). The OS should
basically trust the BIOS MTRR settings. If the OS can't trust the BIOS,
like on real hardware, the check and the warning is necessary. If the OS
can trust the BIOS, like running in a KVM or QEMU virtual machine, it
should just ignore the case where all MTRRs are blank.
