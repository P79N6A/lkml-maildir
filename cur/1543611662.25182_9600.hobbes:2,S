No there is no oops with 2.4.16, BUT I am sure CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL is
not set in my kernel 2.4.16. I shall try to re-compile it with it.
2.5.1-pre5 is fine as well, provided that you don't say yes to
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL.

I am building linux in /usr/gnu/linux. There is only one file in
/usr/src/linux, the System.map I put before running ksymoops.

I have now removed this line in fstab. It was useful when /dev had
permanent device files. With devfs only it's not needed but it doesn't
improve.

You misundertood me. I would never include in the kernel a binary driver
