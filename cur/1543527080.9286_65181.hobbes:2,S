you're missing something. probably you have a kernel compiled with
symbol versioning and module without, or something like that.

if this weren't exported, no filesystem could be a module.
kernel/ksyms.c and arch/i386/i386_ksyms.c contain a list of exported symbols.
cat /proc/ksyms also gives a list of exported symbols for the currently
running kernel.
