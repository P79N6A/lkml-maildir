No it is not bogus, it is a hardware issue that the kernel can not fix.
It is dirty noise on the ATA BUS that is introduced in various ways.
PCB traces are to long, between the ATA controller and the IDC40 or there
are signal ground problems.  Next there could be weak contact on the IDC40
pins and the header in ay of the three connection points.  Regardless
where the signal skew error is located, it is an error that is pure
hardware only.  This statement is subject to the clocking rate of the
transfer speed.  If U66 gives errors try U44.
