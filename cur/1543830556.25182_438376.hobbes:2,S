just one comment on the 'guest to guest communication' topic :
guest to guest communication is an important factor in consolidation
scenarios, where containers are packed on one server. This for maintenance
issues or priority issues on a HPC cluster for example. This case of
container migration is problably the most interesting and the performance
should be more than acceptable. May be not a top priority for the moment.
thanks,
C.
