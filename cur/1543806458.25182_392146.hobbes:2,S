It will accelerate anything supported by your driver configuration
in OCF.  For most drivers this is DES/3DES/AES and MD5/SHA

MD5/SHA

Only whats up at 
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/.
The current version supports KLIPS and accelerates ESP and AH.
The use part of the patch allows pluto to use crypto/IKE acceleration
through OCF as well.  You can ditch the user changes completely and
still get almost all the benefits.
The kernel changes appear larger than they are,  this is mainly due to
moving code around to be asynchronous.  The code it self is still the
same and if you read the data packet flow it will look almost identical.
> Is there any working going on, for porting the OCF to the kernel IPsec??
Some people have mentioned playing with 26sec (netkey) and OCF but I do not
know if anyone has it completed or in a state others can play with.
I hope to start on it at some stage if no one gets there before me :-)
Cheers,
