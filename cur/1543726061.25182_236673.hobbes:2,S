I won't go so far as to say if rc1 worked or not, 2 things were going 
on then, first being that rc2 wasn't that far behind rc1, and 2, I'm 
not sure if the nvidia driver in rc1 can do my hardware as I've 
replaced this mobo, all at the samne time.  mobo is now a Biostar 
M7NCD-Pro.  I had some crashes while running rc1, BUT, I also had a 
bad mobo, something in the buss system being overstressed by a 
failing nvidia gforce2 vidio card, which in turn was leading to 
random memory errors.  That wasn't conducive to my pointing any 
fingers at the kernel until I had fixed the hardware probs with new 
hardware.  In any event, I'm now running 2.6.8-rc2-bk3-nf2, the nf2 
to remind me that it no longer has a via ide chipset in it.  And a 
tail -f running on the log in another window :)
I've been outside, making split rail fencing rails the last 3 hours 
while this was running, sweaty stuff.  Then I have to go see a 
genuinely Grand Old Man I've known for 20 years, and who passed this 
weekend, so the evening is half spent before it even gets dark here.  
It'll be beer thirty before I know it after that.  Yes, I'm an 
alcoholic, a 2 beers a night one.  :-)
Thanks for the help, maybe this will tell us something in a day or so.
