Hello,
I was looking at using 2.6.x with qla2300 FC cards and
found that the proc FS has changed some.  In
particular, I can not seem to find any control for the
qla2300 cards I have where it was under
/proc/scsi/qla2300 in the 2.4.x kernels.  I need the
interface so I can rescan looking for changes.  I am
curious, does the qla driver which is part of 2.6.x
not have a proc interface or am I doing something
incorrectly?
BTW, I see the kernel found the cards and volumes on
the SAN and that it assigns block devs to these and
that the local MPT scsi driver ends up with a proc at
/proc/mpt. 
Thanks for the help!
Phy
