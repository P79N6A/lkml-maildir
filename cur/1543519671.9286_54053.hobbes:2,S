That's David's.  If I had gotten that far, I would have known your problem!

Hi Nathan and David,
I don't know who to give credit to but since you guys work on E820 I thank
you both - 2.3.34-pre1 works fine on this Proliant/1600 - this part of
your fix:
+               start = PFN_UP(e820.map[i].addr);
+               end = PFN_DOWN(e820.map[i].addr + e820.map[i].size);
+               if (start >= end)
+                       continue;
did the trick cleaner than my earlier suggestion.
Regards,
