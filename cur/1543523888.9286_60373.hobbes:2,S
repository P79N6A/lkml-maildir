I've been unable to locate any current effort to make Apple's HFS+
format available to Linux, so I'm considering making a stab at it.
Before I get to code, though, I need to learn how the kernel and VFS
system talk with the file system modules.  I'd like to learn from an
existing module that is (relatively) intelligently written, and
up-to-date with where the kernel and VFS are going.  Using the old HFS
module is sounding more and more like a no, no, given the changes that
have happened since then.  I am familiar with, and have detailed specs
on, the HFS+ format; its the linux side of things that are weak.
What single-user-centric file system would make a good example?  I'm
assuming that ext2 and ext3 would make good multi-user-centric file
system examples.
Cheers,
