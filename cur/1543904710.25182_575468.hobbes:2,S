Good point. 
Anyway, I think the ACPI problem really is as trivial as the following 
three-liner removal fix. If the user doesn't want suspend, ACPI shouldn't 
force it on him.
A nicer fix might be to also make some of the ACPI helper routines depend 
on whether they are needed or not (which in turn will depend on whether 
suspend support has been compiled into the kernel), but quite frankly, 
that's secondary at least for me.
So if we have a few ACPI routines that will never get called (because we 
don't even enable the interfaces that would *cause* them to be called), I 
don't think that's a huge problem. It's a beauty wart, but nobody really 
cares (and it's even something that we could get the compiler to optimize 
away for us if we really cared).

    Don't force-enable suspend/hibernate support just for ACPI
    
    It's a totally independent decision for the user whether he wants
    suspend and/or hibernation support, and ACPI shouldn't care.
