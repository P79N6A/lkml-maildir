I was missing a NULL terminating entry here.

I was missing a * here, so I ended up allocating fewer bytes.
Correctly that line should read:
+        control_kobject[cpu] = kzalloc(sizeof(*control_kobject[0]),
GFP_KERNEL);
Now the module works on Core Duo too.
Posting this message to this list, just in case somebody else ends up
doing the same mistakes I did.
