This is more a kbuild issue. gcc supply the filename given on the
commandline and when using vpath support in make the input files have
absolute path resulting in gcc using absolute paths to __FILE__.
The only real fix I think would be to teach kbuild to use
top-og-source-tree as root when building the kernel. And that will break
a lot if this is changed.
