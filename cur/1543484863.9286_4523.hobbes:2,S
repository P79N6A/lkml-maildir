Without dependency on details of VFS internals.

Gee... How nice. Maybe your know a spell that would magically fix NFS in
this round of changes? That's what I'm fighting with right now. And
[U]MSDOS, for that matter (less terrible). Most of them will be fixed
already... Sheesh... Sure they wiil. Do you realize that things that are
PITA in 3rd-party modules are PITA in the official ones? No? Yes, they
will be fixed. Just that 3rd-party stuff is pain in the asses of its
maintainers while the stuff in official kernel is pain in my ass right
now. Code is code and breakage is breakage, no matter where the breakage
happens.

Yeah??? In case you've missed it: d_move() call goes out of foo_rename()s
and moves to vfs_rename(). And it's not idempotent[1]. If that wouldn't
happen there would be no need even to recompile modules. Problem with
those advocates - they can vgrep but they can't read. Sheesh...
