It doesn't make sense to "adopt a defacto replacement" until it is IN
the kernel and WORKS.  Expect that conversion of the kernel interface
from IRIX to Linux to require at least some amount of pain.  Linux
standardization should be technology driven.  Furthermore, ext2 will
have to be supported more-or-less indefinitely because of the huge
installed base.
