I have am in the process of writing a driver that is software only.  I would like to avoid the caveats of a kernel mode installable module.  I found FUSD (
http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/fusd/
), but would like to know if this is a stable project.
If you have any other suggestions on projects, articles, etc. on Linux User Space Device Drivers, I would greatly appreciate the information.
Please cc: me on your responses.
Thanks,
Bill
