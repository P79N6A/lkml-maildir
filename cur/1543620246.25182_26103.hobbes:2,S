In the fragmentation case (at least over 1500 MTU ethernet), the
headers are a relatively small portion of the total PDU, right?
So, if we reserved 10-15% (or whatever it works out to) that should
make it so we never drop the packet due to fragmentation, right?  I can't see any reason
not to reserve this space, because sending a little later is definately
better than going through the work to send it sooner but then having to
drop it down in the local kernel.  We may only want to reserve the buffers
when they are fairly large (ie not you your very small and slow embedded devices
where memory is very precious).
