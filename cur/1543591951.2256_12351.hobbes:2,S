Subject: Fix for an SMP locking bug in NFS code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
I've already run this by Trond so I'm sending this patch without
further ado.  It adds a lock_kernel around a call into NLM code,
and removes an extraneous (really) lock_kernel in sys_fcntl64.
In more detail:
There's no lock_kernel around the F_SETLK case in fcntl, but
some of the NLM code which gets called in the NFS case needs
to be protected by locks (in particular, nlmclnt_block fiddles
with the global list nlm_blocked).  We decided that, to protect
the RPC code as well, the best place to put a lock would be
around the call to nlmclnt_proc in nfs_lock.
There is, on the other hand, a lock_kernel in fcntl64, and
analysis shows that if it's not needed in fcntl - which it
shouldn't be, if the filesystems do any necessary locking -
then it's not needed in fcntl64 either (the code is essentially
identical).
Cheers,
Matt
