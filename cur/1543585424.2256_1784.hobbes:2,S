Hi there,
just look at fs/cramfs/inode.c:cramfs_read_page()
It uses page_address instead of kmap().
I would have fixed it myself, but I don't know, how I should
kunmap() it, once we have memory pressure.
BTW: I bought an SMP machine with 1GB RAM yesterday to test such
   cases and found the first BUG now.
Yes I know, that nobody build embedded machines with HIGHMEM
support, but it's still a BUG right? ;-)
Regards
Ingo Oeser
