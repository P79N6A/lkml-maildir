Subject: [PATCH 30/45] KVM: SVM: Set the 'g' bit of the cs selector for cross-vendor migration
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/8/110

From: Amit Shah <amit.shah@redhat.com>
The hardware does not set the 'g' bit of the cs selector and this breaks
migration from amd hosts to intel hosts. Set this bit if the segment
limit is beyond 1 MB.
