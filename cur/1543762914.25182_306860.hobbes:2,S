That's ducking the question.  Let me rephrase.
Why was a complete lack of response judged to be an ACK?
For new drivers, that's a -horrible- precedent.  You are quite skilled 
at poking random hackers :)  why not poke somebody to ack a new drivers? 
  It's not like this driver (or many of the other new drivers) 
desperately need to get into the kernel ASAP, so desperate that a lack 
of review was OK.
