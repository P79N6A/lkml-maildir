If you do not need Kuznetsov's networking fixes, Savochkin's changed drivers
and so on you are free to do this.

Hmm. It's far easier to change ISP (especially in US where exist far more
then one ISP) then to change country. But yes, difference is not that big.
Feel free to start OCBL (Offensive Countries Black List) if you wish (perhaps
there are alredy exist one). I'm not sure if vger will use your list though...
P.S. It's my last mail on subject. Arguments are repeating itself and I'll not
see something REALLY new I'll not reply. Since DaveM and Matti made their
feelings clear and will not change their mind without new FACTS this discussion
does not belond to l-k anymore.
