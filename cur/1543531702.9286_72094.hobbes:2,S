A few years ago (after getting OOM problems on Digital UNIX where it killed
the inetd process and locked me out remotly) I had a similar idea (but it's still
only an idea, nothing implemented): 
- Every process has an "importance" value. 
- the first process (e.g. init) starts with a high importance value
- each child process gets smaller importance than the parent process on fork()
- root processes might increase their importance value, all other processes
  might only decrease the importance (similar to scheduling policy). maybe
  a root process should be able to increase the importance of other processes
  too.
- If the system gets into a OOM situation it starts killing the least important 
  processes (e.g. the once with the smallest importance value) until it gets
  out of the OOM situation
I think the implementation of the whole stuff shouldn't be that hard (but
I never did any kernel hacking, so don't count on me). I also think that no
programs have to be changed to get the desired behavior: xterm will w/o changes
have less priority than the X server (because it's a child of X), user programs
started from the xterm shell will have even smaller priority. The only user space
thing needed would be a program similar to nice so that I could for instance
start a daemon with a higher importance from within an unimportant user xterm.
Maybe I'm complete wrong, but in my simple mind the whole idea sounds simple 
but nearly perfect.
