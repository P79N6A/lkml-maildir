Hello,
I recently bought a TX-4 which seems to be using a new chip (PCI ID: 
105A:3519).
It was not supported by the kernel so i added those lines to promise_sata.c
diff sata_promise.c /usr/src/linux-2.6.11.9/drivers/scsi/sata_promise.c
170,171d169
<       { PCI_VENDOR_ID_PROMISE, 0x3519, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0,
<         board_20319 },
Is it the 'right' way?
Thanks
Laurent
