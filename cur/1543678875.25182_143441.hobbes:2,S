Hey Rob,
Your comment about politics is amusing, I'm about the most politically
inept person you are ever going to meet and I have 20 years of Usenet
and mailing list postings, all nicely archived by Google, to prove it.
Thanks for the compliment though, I think you are probably the only
person who has ever even jokingly suggested I should be in politics.  
I don't know why you are all bent out of shape, what is so hard about
hearing "yeah, you sound good, it seems to make sense, but I've heard 
a ton of things that sound good that turned out to be stinkers and now
I trust experience more than I trust things that sound good"?
