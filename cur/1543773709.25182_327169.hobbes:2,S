An emotional argument again.  What's "strange" about it?
You have a choice of:
 1) believe me that the current solution is fine
 2) get down and try to understand the damn thing, and then come up
    with technical arguments for/against it
I know that 2) takes time and energy, and not a lot of people are
interested enough to go through it, but why on earth do you think it
will _ever_ be easier than now.
Thanks,
Miklos
