Hello
The cause for my problems with crashing kernels when accessing the tape
drive were differences between the original external RAID that belongs
to the machine and a temporarily, nearly equal, RAID that we attached while
the original was send away for repair. 
The temp. RAID was Ultra3 160 and /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0 showed me a cur.
speed of 160 while the "old" and working one only did Ultra2 with 80Mbit/s.
I don't know if it's a hardware incompatibility or if the Linux kernel 
drivers cannot handle this specific case.
The problem exists in 2.4.11-pre6, 2.4.13, 2.4.12-ac6 and 2.4.13 with
patched from axboa(?) and D. Miller.
bye,
 -christian-
