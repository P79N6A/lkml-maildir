The simple "cat > titi ..^D ; cat >> titi" case works when mounted with
the noperm option.
BTW : the fstab content is now :
\\r-canaris\ceva6380    /network/home cifs
domain=FTRD,noperm,credentials=/home/ceva6380/.s
ambaShareId 0 0
and the .sambaShareId contains my windows domain (FTRD) login id (same
as $USER value BTW) and the associated password and "umask" at shell
prompts return 0022.
Hope this helps.
