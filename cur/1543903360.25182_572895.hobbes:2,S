Hello,
as promised I just published my version of the driver for PXA27x USB
device controller.
You can find all references om my wiki at:
   
http://wiki.enneenne.com/index.php/PXA27x_UDC
I reworked the driver according to latest suggestions from you. It's
far from perfection but it's still functional even if I tested it
_only_ with ether gadget. :)
My goal is to have a common code where we all can work together in
order to perfect the code and writing it in order to allow kernel
inclusion.
So every suggestions, modifications and patches all welcomed!
Rodolfo
