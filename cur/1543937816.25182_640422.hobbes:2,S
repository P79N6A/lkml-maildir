Well not exactly. Unlike the mm tree which is made of a lots of patches
dealing with totaly unrelated subjects, the rt patches only hopefully deal
with realtime stuffs.

I'm probably missing something since I haven't looked at the RT patches
(yet) but couldn't these 300 patches be sorted out by topics ?
If so you could create a branch per topic and merge all of them in your
master branch which would be the rt kernel. Hopefully each branch
won't interact with other branch too much.
All of this assumes of course that the number of topics is definitely much
smaller than the number of patches (~300).
Having such a tree would be very useful for looking at history in each topic,
for doing some git-bisect debug session IMHO...

Yep, not that I'm an expert in this architecture but it's commonly used
in multimedia device where realtime is often needed.
