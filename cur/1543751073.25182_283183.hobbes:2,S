Here's a relatively simple idea: Why not make the "Realtime LSM"
just check for a certain "Realtime" credential in the new credential
store (Patch is in 2.6.10, see [1] for control program).  You would
mark it as a system credential and give access to that credential via
the appropriate capability with a small utility program.
Of course, I _do_ respect that I am not providing a patch which they
have done.  I think this serves a useful place and should probably be
included as-is, for now.  A later update to make it use a better
mechanism would be nice, though. :-)
