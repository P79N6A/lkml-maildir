Hey, nice try, Ken!  But I don't think we can let you sneak shared
pagetables into 2.6.19 that way ;)
Sorry for not noticing this bug in your original TLB flush fix,
which had looked good to me.
Yes, I'd expect your i_mmap_lock to solve the problem: and since
you're headed in that direction anyway, it makes most sense to use
that solution rather than get into defining arrays, or sacrificing
the lazy flush, or risking page_count races.
So please extract the __unmap_hugepage_range mods from your shared
pagetable patch, and use that to fix the bug.  But again, I protest
the "if (vma->vm_file)" in your unmap_hugepage_range - how would a
hugepage area ever have NULL vma->vm_file?
Hugh
