You're missing the point.
It's ok to do "read()/write()" on structures. In fact, people do that all
the time (and then they complain about the file not being portable ;)
The problem with ioctl is that not only are people passing ioctl's
pointers to structures, but:
 - they're not telling how big the structure is
 - the structure can have pointers to other places
 - sometimes it modifies the structure passed in
None of which are "network-nice". Basically, ioctl() is historically used
as a "pass any crap into driver xxxx, and the driver - and ONLY the driver
- will know what to do with it".
And when _only_ a driver knows what the arguments mean, upper layers can't
encapsulate them. Upper layers cannot make a packet of the argument and
send it over the network to another machine. Upper layers cannot do
sanity-checking on things like "is this argument a valid pointer". Which
means, for example, that not only can you not send the ioctl arguments
anywhere, but ioctl's have also historically been a hot-bed of bugs.
Example traditional ioctl bugs: use kernel pointers to access the argument
(because it just happens to work on x86, never mind the fact that if the
argument is bad you'll get a kernel oops and/or a serious security error).
Other example: different drivers/f ilesystems implementing the same ioctl,
but disagreeing on what the argument means (is it a pointer to an integer
argument, or the integer itself?).
Now, the advantage of using read()/write() is (a) that it's unambiguous
where the argument comes from and how big it is and (b) because of that
the _psychology_ is different. You don't get into this "pass random crap
around, let the kernel modify user data structures directly" mentality.
And psychology is important.
