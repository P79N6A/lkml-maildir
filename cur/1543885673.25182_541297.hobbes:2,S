Indeed.

Butting in here. It's not supported because LE mode has to work in a  
brain-damaged way. NPE DMAs the complete skb straight out of RAM.  
Unfortunately it expects the skb to already be written out in ram BE.
Thus, in LE mode we have to byteswap the skb with CPU before the NPE  
can DMA it. This hasn't been implemented yet.
