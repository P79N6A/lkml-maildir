Yes, this is the kind of approach I was after. Not a new X server, but
rather a straightforward extension to existing ones. 
The video mode programming issue is already black magic, and totally
separate from actually drawing stuff on the screen. I can't for the life
of me imagine that there would ever be an excuse to make a completely new
X server just because the mode programming changed. 
That's like separating the S3 X server into ten different X servers
depending on which clock chip is on the board. That would just be silly
and stupid, wouldn't it? But it's really almost exactly the same issue: 
the fact that the kernel handles mode switching could just be considered
"a software clock chip" kind of thing. No?
