Well yes. And it's correct. Variable `i' in the following code
should be a 'size_t'.

... and we all know that it's dumb to do:
    for(i=0; i< (int) ArraySize(foo); i++)
... just to placate a compiler. But the compiler did find what
could-have-been a real problem so the compiler is, indeed, correct.
Maybe what is needed is -Wsign-compare and -Wsign-strict, where
-Wsign-compare warns of obvious errors that could cause continuous
loops, etc., and -Wsign-strict acts like the current -Wsign-compare.
I agree that the current -Wsign-compare is way too strict for the
usual coding style where most int compares are "don't care" things
that are not worth casts.
