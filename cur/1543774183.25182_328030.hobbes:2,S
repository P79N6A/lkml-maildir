That works, but seems like "the long way".
You don't need to be given a tarball of a /dev tree - make your own!
tar up your existing devfs-based /dev tree (at a time when all
your devices are present)  then umount devfs and untar it
all.   Then you have a static /dev which works with the existing setup,
and a nondevfs kernel can boot right away.
The udev way may be necessary if you actually have lots of devices
that come and go, such as usb thingies.  It shouldn't be necessary
just to boot the machine though.

Fortunately, one doesn't need to convert back.  Just copy devfs-dev onto
ext3-dev and there you have the "good old" devfs-names in a static /dev.
