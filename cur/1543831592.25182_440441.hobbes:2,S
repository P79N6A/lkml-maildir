I meant ->writepages() used by balance_dirty_pages(), see below.

This assumption is valid for ext2, where ->writepages() simply sends
pages to the storage, but other file systems (like reiser4) do a *lot*
of work in ->writepages() path, allocating quite an amount of memory
before starting write-out. With your patch, this work is done from
pdflush, and won't be throttled by may_write_to_queue() check, thus
increasing a risk of allocation failure.
