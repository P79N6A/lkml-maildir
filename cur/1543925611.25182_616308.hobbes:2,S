I think a megafreeze development model is sane.  Finding a collection
of software versions that are all known to work together is very
interesting, and useful.  Making it so you can deliver something that
just works to end users is always interesting.
The only thing you miss out on are new features like the latest hardware
support.
I think forking packages just so you can claim they are frozen is a
dubious practice.  Especially if features are added in those forks.
(Yes new hardware support is a feature).
