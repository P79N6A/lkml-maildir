Looks like the right thing to do indeed. Should be fairly easy, just
test if the address if negative (you'll never use >2Gb address space on
these) and ... heh, you already do it in your 8xx TLB miss handlers to
separate user page tables from kernel page tables :) So I doubt the
normal user TLB miss path will be any different and the kernel TLB miss
path though be separate and faster due to having much less misses.
Also, you may want to bump the whole page size to 64k on these,
interesting exercise but probably not very difficult. Our ABI is already
clean at the userland level for up to 64k. We did some experiments on
ppc64 with pseudo-64k pages (emulating them in software) and common
ppc32 userland is just fine.
Using a larger page size makes a lot of sense of those embedded CPUs
with small TLBs where you usually don't use much or no swap at all.
