I was rather thinking of only comparing a cup's TSC with the SAME cup's TSC.  We only use the TSC to 
bridge from the latest update of the the clock to now and when we update the clock we capture (i.e. 
update this cup's last TSC value) the TSC on that CPU.  If we also capture the system time then we 
have a set of (last TSC, sys clock) for each CPU.  If we further, keep 64-bits of TSC, we don't 
really require each cpu to update the clock very often, or, we could force such and update from time 
to time as needed.  This would not require the TSC to be synced at all and even if they had 
different rates we could add that to the per cpu data and cover that too.
What this does require is that we do a really good job of figuring the TSC multiplier, something we 
don't do at all well today (rc5-rt5 on my box is fast by ~15 sec/ day).  We might also want to 
verify that we are not letting monotonic time be other than monotonic :)
As you might suspect, I have some ideas about how to do a much better job of figuring out the TSC 
multiplier.
