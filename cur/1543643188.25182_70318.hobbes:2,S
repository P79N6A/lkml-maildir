Subject: 2.5.34 unable to mount root fs on 09:00 (smp,raid1,devfs,scsi)

2.5.33 works. 2.5.34 and 2.5.34-bk3 won't mount the
root fs.  The root fs is on /dev/md/1, composed
of 2 partitions on different scsi disks.
The RAID-1 setup is autodetected, so it don't look
like a hardware or scsi problem.  Everything seems normal
until the root mount fail and the kernel hangs.  Not
even sysrq works after that.
