Subject: [patch] nonempty pipe does not select for write
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
I am repeating the main points of a discussion in
a local maling list (for a demonstrating program
see my mail to l-k of 26. 9. 1999 with subject
"nonempty pipe does not select for write").
In the current pipe implementation there is no possibility
to write to a pipe filedescriptor, when there is something
in the pipe that was not read. This is bad, when the
connected processes do some signalling via the pipe -
when the writing process writes a single byte, it
can not proceed until the byte is read by the peer.
The theory is that if the PIPE_BUF is set to the actual
kernel buffer size for the pipe, it is in fact impossible
to do anything else - the pipe writes up to PIPE_BUF
are guaranteed to be atomic and if the descriptor selects
for write, it should be guaranteed that the next write
does not block. As the amount of the data in the send
is not known at the time of select, it is impossible
to let the user do a write when the remaining size of
the kernel buffer is less than PIPE_BUF.
The kernel pipe code is actually prepared for changing
this and differentiates between PIPE_BUF and PIPE_SIZE.
I am appending a patch against 2.3.33 that allocates
2 * PIPE_BUF and allows a poll for write when there
is at least PIPE_BUF space free. Could someone please
review it if it makes sense? - it works for me, but
I am no kernel expert and do not know the exact semantics
behind kernel poll routines etc.
For a simple test program sending one byte at a time the
context switch rate went down approximately ten times.
Regards
