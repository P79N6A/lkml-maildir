I am seeing the same thing with the [named <defunct>] on a PIII 600,
so it is not Athlon specific. I haven't yet tried test13-pre6 but it
happens with pre3,4,5. So I am still running on test12.
I will try running pre6 then, if it still fails will try with your
context.patch and see if that fixes it.
