No doubt Greg, if I had a clue about usb things.  Oops or not, that 
reboot took 20x as long as it should have in the shutdown as 
something was seriously eating cpu.  I went to another shell to see 
if top would run, but 2 minutes after I'd typed it, still no top.  
Hence the reboot to -mm2, which has been stable although no optical 
(dvd/cd) recordings have been attempted.
Another question, has anything been done recently that would disable 
amanda?
