Rik,
The problem might be the write_lock(&tasklist_lock).  Interrupt handlers
sometimes call kernel functions that would require a lock on
tasklist_lock.  If that interrupt happens during the time you hold write
lock on tasklist_lock, a deadlock would happen.
Try using write_lock_irq() to fix that problem.
BTW, I really think interrupt handlers acquiring the same locks which
can be acquired by processes is a *BIG* problem in Linux.  We should fix
this problem.  Unfortunately I am not familiar with Linux kernel well
enough to offer a solution.
