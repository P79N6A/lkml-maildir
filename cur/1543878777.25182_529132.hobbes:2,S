Same response as to Andrew:  AFAICS that just increases complexity.
The simple path for programmers is writing straightforward code that 
does something like
	blah
	msleep()
	blah
or in pccardd's case,
	mutex_lock()
	blah
	mutex_unlock()
to permit sleeping without having to write more-complex code that deals 
with context transitions.
For slow-path, infrequently executed code, it is best to keep it as 
simple as possible.
