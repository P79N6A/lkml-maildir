PROBLEM SOLVED!  I'm glad to say It's *almost* not a kernel bug,
more like a missing feature.
In my ip-up.local script, I do:
        echo "Loading NAT modules:"
        /sbin/modprobe ip_conntrack
        /sbin/modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp
        /sbin/modprobe ip_conntrack_irc
        /sbin/modprobe iptable_nat
        /sbin/modprobe ip_nat_ftp
        /sbin/modprobe ip_nat_irc
	[...several filtering and QoS rules...]
	$iptab -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o $IFNAME -j SNAT --to-source $IPLOCAL
My ip-down.local attempts to do the opposite:
        echo "Flushing all current rules:"
        $iptab -F
        $iptab -F -t nat
        echo "Clearing all chains:"
        $iptab -X
        $iptab -Z
        $iptab -X -t nat
        $iptab -Z -t nat
        echo "Removing NAT modules:"
        /sbin/rmmod ip_nat_ftp ip_nat_irc iptable_nat ip_conntrack ip_conntrack_ftp ip_conntrack_irc
Note the order of the modules in the last line: ip_conntrack cannot
be unloaded because it's still being used by ip_conntrack_ftp and
ip_conntrack_irc.
So, whenever the PPP link goes down, ip_conntrack remains loaded with
all connections still being tracked until the timer expires!
If ppp0 goes up again soon enough, the script reloads the ip_nat modules,
but the existing connections are no longer being translated.
Would it be possible to do something at module initialization time
to recover those connections?  Meanwhile, I've fixed my rmmod to make
sure ip_conntrack really gets unloaded.
