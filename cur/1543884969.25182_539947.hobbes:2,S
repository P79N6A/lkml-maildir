Yes.

It _was_ established towards the end of that thread that neither of the two
cases are atomic contexts. And it would still make sense to remove the redundant
__GFP_HIGH, as we don't want to unnecessarily deplete the emergency
reserve pool for normal GFP_KERNEL cases thus making ENOMEM on some future
kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) more likely. I'll send out the patches.
