Well... looking at the code it seems that OpenVZ doesn't use this
strategy, instead performs UBC-based I/O accounting looking at the
__set_page_dirty*() for writes and submit_bio() for reads. Then,
independently from accounting data, it uses per-UBC i/o priority model
that is mapped directly on the CFQ i/o priority model.
