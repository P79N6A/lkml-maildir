It's not an error.  It the very basic concept of always having a correct
thread descriptor.  A process created with fork() from an MT app is
different from one created with fork() from a single threaded app.  In
the latter case the thread descriptors are not used and can contain
garbage.  In the former case the descriptor better be correct all the
time.  It basically the same problem as with setting the TLS "register".
 clone() get the CLONE_TLS flag because the child and parent have
(potentially) different TLS address and it is not possible to set the
value before the fork() call (since the parent would have the wrong
value for some time) nor after the fork() (since then there would be a
window for a signal to arrive for an uninitialized thread).

Yes, but then clone still has to get two addresses.  In case of the
fork() implementation the parent's TID value must not be overwritten
while the child's TID value is at exactly the same virtual address as
the value in the parent.  I've no problem with requiring the value
always to be written (the pointer can be to a scratch object) but there
must be two pointer parameters for that.
