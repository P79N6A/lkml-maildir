could you give -G7 a try:
	redhat.com/~mingo/O(1)-scheduler/sched-2.6.0-test1-G7
Mr. Kirk was busy fixing the IDE code (a subsystem he loves to contribute
to) but i managed to get some code from Mr. Spock: it introduces
ON_RUNQUEUE_WEIGHT, set to 30% currently. Wakeups that come from IRQ
contexts get a 100% sleep average - most hw interrupts are of interactive
nature.
this method should result in process-context wakeups giving a limited but
load-proportional boost - which boost is enough to prevent such tasks from
getting max CPU hogs, but not enough to make them permanently interactive.
