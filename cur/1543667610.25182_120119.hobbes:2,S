If he's seeing what I'm seeing then I can put my own answers to this. I
get freezups, lost keystrokes and eventual shutdown of the laptop. I can
reproduce it prettymuch at will be it a compilation of a piece of s/w,
the kernel, mozilla loading pages or whatnot.

UP with and without preempt presents the same issues.

My box never survived long enough for me to be able to look.

Never had this under 2.4, Not sure wchi version now as I went to 2.5
with this laptop as soon as the freeze came and I could back it up.
As for 2.5 I can definately say the sluggishness and freezes happen with
2.5.63+ (about to compile .66 and try it) but .63 does not turn the
laptop off for me and .64 takes a wee bit more punishment before dieing
on me.

From memory, I niced (to lvl 19) a compile of mplayer that was killing
my laptop and it survived.

Not too sure. For me it's 'when compiling don't even think of looking at
an input device the wrong way or BOOM'.
