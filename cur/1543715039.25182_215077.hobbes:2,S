Currently we are running Redhat 9.0 and Suse 9.0 boxes with plans to
possibly move to Suse 9.1 boxes when the Suse 9.1 comes out with 2.6
kernel support.
I've seen several sites claiming to provide the elusive "mrouted".
Can you point me to a specific location for "the" mrouted demon you are
referring to ;)
Have you played with xorp.org? It claims to be a multicast capable
router?
Thanks.
