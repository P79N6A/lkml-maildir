Surprises like regular RTS/CTS flow control ?
Aren't there serial chips that are able to handle it themselves ? (so
that the _serial driver_ should be responsible for that, doing it in
software if needed)
I'm asking because there was some funny bug not that far ago: async
ppp people thought that xon/xoff were processed in the serial driver,
because "some serial chips may be able to handle that themselves". So
they weren't processing them. But actually it's really up to the
ldisc to process them. Thus nobody was processing it !
