If the box has been on the shelf for 8 years it would.  If
the driver isn't in mainline i'm not very interested in what
drivers are in the box.  I want a URL where i can go and
look to see the versions for download.

There is a big difference between "some assembly required"
and "some machining required".  Driver source that has to be
modified doesn't count.  This isn't labelling for kernel
hackers.  Some people need it to just work, others are OK
following a script to patch and rebuild or setup an insmod.
What we are talking about is enough info that someone should
feel comfortable buying the box with the expectation of
support at the level they require.

Perhaps you'd be willing to help Aunt Tillie do this.  Your
definition of "includes driver sources" will appeal to such a
small market segment it isn't worth the ink on the box.
