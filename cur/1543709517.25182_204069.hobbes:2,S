Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.x BSD Process Accounting w/High UID
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/4/153

Greetings:
The patch only changes two lines of code  which redefine the
ac_uid/ac_gid fields as uid_t/gid_t respectively.  Fixes accounting for
high uid/gids.
