I'm using this drive with my BP6 without any problems.
But to have stable system I would suggest to not use UDMA4 mode
if you are stressing you harddrive to much.
Use UDMA3 (hdparm -X67 /dev/hd_your_ibm_drive)
With this mode I've been unable to crash my BP6 with any load on my
system)
Also try to use latest BIOSes (RU)
