Does that mean that we can implement only one policy which crash_kexec()
can execute. In this case clash seems to be that we want multiple policies
to co-exist. Like, a user wants to generate a notification for the 
remote node so that remote node takes over and then also take crash dump
to diagnose the source of problem on failing node.

How do I ensure co-existence of multiple policies?

That's true. Anything which runs after panic() is running in an unreliable
environment. But I guess everybody understands that and all the code which
runs after panic(), is not guranteed to execute successfuly. Otherwise there
is no point in keeping panic_notifier_list around.
So the concern here is that how do we manage multiple policies which should
execute after a crash/panic?
