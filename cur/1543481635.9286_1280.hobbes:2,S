Subject: kernel mirrors behavior changed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The mx.kernel.org mirror and probably others will thoughtfully (??)
gunzip the file as it's downloaded, at least when downloaded with
netscape.  However, when it does this under DOS/Win it adds returns that
patch can't handle.  The original kernel.org doesn't gunzip the file, so
there's no text conversion problem. In addition, the ascii converted
file retains its .gz suffix...which is just plain wrong.
Can we please request that kernel.org "branded" distribution sites
behave the same way?  I really don't like having to untangle the effects
of applying a DOS/ascii patch. I don't like having to remember to check
on formats after a download.  I don't like having to run the patch
through dos2unix.
I don't care what a mirror does on it's own, but if it's mentioned in
the
"official mirrors list", it should meet some standard of compatibility
or at least explain in clear language how it works...that's clear
language to the upcomming linux masses, not somebody with 5-10 years of
unix administration experience.  BTW, I don't care about last weeks
issue of .gz vs .bz2 because that's reasonably obvious.
