No. The mechanism would be generic, but the parameters would be
arch specific as part of my sched domains patch (if I have anything
to do with it!)

I wouldn't pretend to know about hardware, but it seems like much nicer
than doing it in software. Anyway, if there is hardware out there without
priorities then it would be a good idea to code for it.
