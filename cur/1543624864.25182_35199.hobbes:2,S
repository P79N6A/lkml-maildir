I was having this problem as well on an iBM M-Pro P2 450 with the aic7895
onboard (dual channel), while an identical P2 400 did not seem to have
the same problem with the same kernel build.
I think the problem started around 2.4.13 or so.  I can boot from warn
reboot, but not cold reboot.
I just tried applying the aic7xxx 6.2.5 driver patch to replace 6.2.4
that is in 2.4.18, and it actually appears to have removed the problem.
I know the new version asks in the config if you want to probe for
EISA/VLB cards, which I set to no, so either that fixed it (I should
try aic7xxx=no_probe with the other kernel), or something else in the
changes in the code has fixed it.  I personally suspect a marginal timing
issue during init given the 400mhz machine is fine and the 450mhz machine
was not.  Having not read through all the code changes in the patch,
I am not sure.
