			 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On a largely idle system (like notebooks on battery power in typical use)
the accounting overhead will be less a problem. However, the CPU being 
woken up each millisecond will cause an increased battery usage. So if 
the load is less than a certain threshold, tickless systems do make much 
sense.
