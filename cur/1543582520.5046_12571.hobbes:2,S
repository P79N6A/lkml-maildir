Hello guys,
I am trying to set up a big jump: going from RedHat 6.1 kernel 2.2.12 to
RedHat 7.0 kernel 2.2.16.
For backward compatibility, I would like to compile an ANSI C application 
on 7.0 and run on 6.1.
How is it possible ?
Do I need to copy /lib/libc-2.1.92.so (the one of 7.0) on 6.1 system ?
Many thanks
