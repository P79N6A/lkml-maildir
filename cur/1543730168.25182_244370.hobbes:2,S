On re-looking at the spec and the voltage tolerance tables in particular
I realize my approach is not valid. A VID#B can be driven at VID#A
voltages but there is no voltage in common for some frequencies between
all VID# variants.

Perhaps the VID# variant can be found via MSRs - if not the static tables
will not be workable and the ACPI approach will have to be the sole method.
