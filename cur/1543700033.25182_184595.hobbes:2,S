seems to be needed to make the following code later in the function work
	if (bufp) {
		if (urb->transfer_buffer_length < len)
			len = urb->transfer_buffer_length;
		urb->actual_length = len;
		// always USB_DIR_IN, toward host
		memcpy (ubuf, bufp, len);
	}
in the case where bounce buffers are being used to implement PCI DMA
operations.  Without the patch, the subsequent pci_unmap_single copies
the contents of the bounce buffer over the top of urb->transfer_buffer,
destroying what the memcpy() put there.
My USB knowledge is pretty limited, so I've no idea whether this patch
adversely affects anything else in rh_call_control.
The patch is against 2.4.23-pre-something, but I see the code's the same
in 2.6.
