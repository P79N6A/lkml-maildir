I've actually got the coda_inode_info (inode->u.u_coda_fs_i) split out
of the union in my development kernel. It doesn't shrink the size of the
struct inode yet, Coda isn't the biggest user at the moment.
But, it forced me to do several cleanups in the code, and it even has
resulted in fixing a 'leak'. Not a real memory loss leak one, but we
left uninitialized inodes around in the icache for no good reason. Also
changing a but in a coda specific header file does trigger an almost
complete rebuild of the whole kernel (coda.h -> coda_fs_i.h -> fs.h ->
everything?)
The allocation overhead really isn't that bad. kmalloc/kfree are also
using the slabcache, and a trivial variant using a 'private' slabcache
gave me the counters to find the 'leak' I mentioned before.
I can't really evaluate performance impacts. The struct inode is still
the same size, so for now there even is a little bit of additional
memory pressure. Also, Coda wasn't really developed to achieve high
performance but more to explore novel features.
