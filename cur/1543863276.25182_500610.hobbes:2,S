I just change it once, then it freeze. It's hard to get the 'right time'
Actually I tried it several times before. As I remember there was once it 
freezed for around 1 or 2 minutes , then back to normal operation. This is 
the first time it completely freezed and I waited after around 10 minutes it 
still didn't wake up.
