Subject: [GIT *] Remove inclusion of obsolete <linux/config.h>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please pull from git://git.infradead.org/~dwmw2/killconfig.h.git
This removes all inclusion of the obsolete <linux/config.h> and turns
that file into a simple #error. I chose to add #error rather than just
deleting the file, to make the error message more informative and
hopefully prevent too many people from asking "where did config.h go?".
Sam thinks it should be a #warning instead, even though it's been
unnecessary to include config.h for about eight months now. If you
agree, pull from git://git.infradead.org/~dwmw2/woundconfig.h.git
instead -- that differs from the first in that it turns config.h into a
#warning instead.
Please pull one or the other, as you see fit.
