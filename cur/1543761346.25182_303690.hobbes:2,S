Yes, Xen will break w/o them, because physical addresses are an 
illusory trick that the guest OS plays on itself to give itself the 
impression of a contiguous memory map. We use _to_machine and _to_bus 
macros to get 'real' physical addresses.
For allocating the GATT itself, using dma_alloc_coherent() as done in 
my patch certainly seems sane -- the bus base address of that table is 
poked into a chipset register, right?
As for poking entries into the GATT, I guess I'm not sure what ought to 
be used. virt_to_phys() doesn't sound right to me: the GART is a bridge 
between two buses, so some sort of bus mapping would still be in order 
imo. Perhaps Linux should allow mapping requests to be tagged with a 
bridge id, like in *BSD? :-)
So: I would very much like you to take the patches I made to generic.c 
that replace __get_free_pages() calls with dma_alloc_coherent(). For 
now, the patch lines that poke into the GATT I guess stay as they are. 
We can maintain an out-of-tree patch for Xen, or perhaps if 
virt_to_phys() is not used very much we can override its definition.
