Thanks Christoph, I think this will be required to support 386.
In the worst case, we could provide a fallback path and take
->tree_lock in pagecache lookups if there is no atomic_cmpxchg,
however I would much prefer all architectures get an atomic_cmpxchg,
and I think it should turn out to be a generally useful primitive.
I may trim this down to only provide what is needed for atomic_cmpxchg
if that is OK?
