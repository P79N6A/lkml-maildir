It all looks very easy if the web server has two IPs.  Making it simple, 
use the following example after modifying the necessary information:
Web server public IPs: 99.0.0.5/32(ADSL), 100.0.0.5/32(SDSL), and set 
default via 10.0.0.1
Gateway: 10.0.0.1 on all interfaces, no default unless you choose to 
have one
ADSL: 99.0.0.1/24, SDSL: 100.0.0.1/24
Routing setup on web server is to point to the default gateway, nothing 
special needed.
Routing on *DSL isn't under your control.
All control is handled on the gateway. (web/eth2, SDSL/eth1, ADSL/eth0)
Gateway:
(establish interfaces)
ip a a 10.0.0.1/32 brd + dev eth0; ip link set eth0 up
ip a a 10.0.0.1/32 brd + dev eth1; ip link set eth1 up
ip a a 10.0.0.1/32 brd + dev eth2; ip link set eth2 up
(add routing for the web server IPs - inbound traffic)
ip route add 99.0.0.5 dev eth2
ip route add 100.0.0.5 dev eth2
(make packet matching rules, tie them to given tables)
ip rule add from 99.0.0.5/32 to 0.0.0.0/0 table 99 prio 99
ip rule add from 100.0.0.5/32 to 0.0.0.0/0 table 100 prio 100
(add the routing based on the table - outbound traffic)
ip route add via 99.0.0.1 table 99 dev eth0 onlink
ip route add via 100.0.0.1 table 100 dev eth1 onlink
This is off the top of my head but it should work fine.
Of course if the *DSL arrives on the gateway via a hub, simply combine 
the interfaces as appropriate.
