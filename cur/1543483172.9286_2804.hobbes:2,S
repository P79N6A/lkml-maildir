Linus,
Please apply this to keep Andries happy, and correct a bug introduced
earlier during the geometry discussions that overlooked "small disks".
This applies directly against 2.2.1.
Alan,
I will compose a patch for 2.0.37pre4 shortly that reflects all
changes and corrections.  This should be ready no later than monday.

Andries,
If there is a personal issue that you have with me, please state clearly.
This kind of publicly directed abuse is the exact reason why there is a
new "IDE maintainer".  Your knowledge of geometry rules may supercede my
current level, but attempts to communicate your thoughts is lacking
something.  Feel free to exploite this issue, if needed, but all you
are doing is making it difficult to take you seriously.
Everyone makes mistakes, and the attactiveness of Linux is the
collaboration efforts to reach the right solution.  This method of
personal attacks is unwarrented and unnecessary.  You are free
to continue.  I just can not let myself stoop to this level of
kindergarden conduct.
Attached is a patch to fix this issue that you have with the current code.
Next time ::
1st	Please try to present clearly the problem/issue that concerns you.
2nd	Your rational as they pertains to the point in question.
3rd	A proposed solution, that addresses the problem.
4th	Any potential problems that could result and why.
5th	Choose a direct line of communication v/s blindly protesting.
It is obvious that you don't agree with anything that I do, yet you chose
to not step up to the challenge.  When the position was vacant, I waited
for anyone more qualified than me to step up.  Since you somehow
determined that the task of being the 'IDE maintainer' was not suited to
your liking or ablities, someone had to do it.
Your high opinion of me and the hard (unpaid-volunteer-thankless) work
that I am doing is greatly appreciated.  I do this because I need the
support for my own projects.  Glory is for those who either can not or
will not do the details but lay claim to it and side step blame.

You just need a bigger hammer, or learn how to swing the one you have better.
