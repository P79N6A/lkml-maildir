..and even that looks like I'd have to do the quick-and-dirty case with
the race still there on SMP. Adding the page Uptodate logic to the VM
layer proper is too painful at this point - every single nopage function
would have to be updated to mark its page up-to-date, as they don't
generally do that currently.
Also, the fact that Petr didn't see anything trigger in nopage() makes me
nervous again. Even if the problem happened during read-ahead, it should
have gotten into the address space only through nopage. Maybe there is
some vma that isn't added to the right inode VM list - so that we end up
missing part of the vmtruncate() stuff?
Al, any ideas?
