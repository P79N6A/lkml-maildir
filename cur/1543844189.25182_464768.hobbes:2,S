I thought last time you supported adding a pointer to struct page (when
you mentioned next gen slab will also consume page->mapping).  May be I
missed your point.

Sure this is non-zero overhead but I think this is the logical place to
track the memory.

Not sure if I understood that.  I've myself tested these patches on
2.6.18-rc6-mm2 kernel and they apply just fine.  Are you just trying to
