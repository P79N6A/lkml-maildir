After booting and initscripts I get some kind of error like a BUG() but
I can't see what it is because it scrolls off with repeated "unable to
handle kernel paging request" messages. The first error shows a stack trace
(briefly) but all the rest just show the offsets without the text.
If I choose just Generic IDE then I can boot (of course I don't get to
use ATA/133). No mouse, but since that error has been there since 2.4.20
pre8 I'm pretty sure it's not related.
There are no error messages in the logs - just a long series of <nul>
where the messages would be.
