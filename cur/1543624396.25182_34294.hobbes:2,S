Yes, you are right.
But as I told: It was the least invasive method for me.
Applying it as a config option, would include adding a MODULE_PARM
section, which doesn't exist yet (not for me, I have ACPI compiled
into the kernel, but to keep it consistent even if compiled as
module). I'm not *that* proof with linux kernel source to guarantee
side-effect-freeness and so on.
This part I'd like to leave for developers knowing better, what
they're doing :)
However, if someone of the ACPI developers or someone of the
patch-acceptors (:)) tells me 'do it, we'll patch it in', I'll do
it.
If it has no chance to get in, I wont do it - for me myself, my
patch is quite enough :)
thanks for your response & regards,
   Mario
