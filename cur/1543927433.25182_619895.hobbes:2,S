A single can be used in 99% of all cases, OEM or users can muck
it up. I would 'vote' for hba_kernel_version == fw_version.
Maybe add a companion standard for hba_bios_version == bios_version
and hba_monitor_version == exec_version (executive_version) if other
cards can supply such info ...

There are 113 cards this driver works for in concert. Maybe my tail
feathers are showing ;->

Simple answer:
	No
Detailed answer (I digress):
They love ioctls as a commonality across all operating
systems and a pass-through to proprietary firmware
portals: binary, bidirectional, atomic and freely
formatted migrating structures that do not herd the
cats into just one specification. These are all
eventually presented as documented stable objects
exported by a sizeable C++ StorLib(tm) library that
provides the consistent interface that the OEMs and
Adaptec use to the higher level install, event, GUI
and CLI applications. Driver is only involved as a
transport.
