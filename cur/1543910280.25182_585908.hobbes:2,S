yes, it needs to exist until the whole process exits, but no, __exit_signal()
sets ->signal == NULL under sighand->siglock. This btw happens per thread.

No. proc_info_read() finds a "pid_alive()" task with a valid signal, and bumps
its ->usage. But nothing prevent this thread from exiting (in fact, it may be
already dead), after that the parent can reap that task, or it can reap itself
if it was detached thread.
This means that proc_read() can assume nothing about the task, except that its
task_struct can't disappear.

->signal == NULL leads to panic().
