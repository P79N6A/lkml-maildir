So that means you are using cmpxchg to do the locking. I mean, not the
"locking" itself, but a similar process to that of locking. I see. 
However, isn't it the almost the same as spinlocking? You are basically
trying to "allocate" a channel idx with atomic cmpxchg; if it fails, you
are retrying, spinning on the retry code until successful.
Not meaning to be an smartass here, but I don't buy the "lockless" tag,
I would agree it is an optimized-lock scheme [assuming it works better
than the spinlock case, that I am sure it does because if not you guys
would have not gone through the process of implementing it], but it is
not lockless.
Although it is not that important, no need to make a fuss out of that :)
