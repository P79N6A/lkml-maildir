Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There were no merge conflicts and only one build failure!
We are up to 27 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).  I would encourage architecture maintainers, in particular, to
set up a git branch or quilt tree now to avoid the rush after RC2 :-)
I will stop making these announcements now unless there is some change to
the tree or things people should know.  There should be a new tree every
(Australian Capital Territory) working day.
