Here is a diff against the O3int patch in 2.5.74-mm3 trying to decrease audio 
skips and improve X smoothness.
It is easier to become interactive with this one to try and decrease 
application startup and wakeup time, while hopefully still preventing cpu 
hogs from starving the machine.
Changes:
Child penalty increased to 95 as in early 2.5 O(1) implementations. This fixes 
the "parent spinning madly waiting for child to spawn and in the process it 
is the parent that starves the child"; 80 wasn't enough.
The sleep buffer has returned much smaller currently set at 50ms which 
prevents fully interactive tasks from dropping down a priority for short 
bursts of cpu activity (eg X).
Idle tasks now get a small priority boost so they "rest" at a dynamic priority 
just below interactive. They now wake up to an interactive state more 
rapidly, and spawn more interactive children.
The variable boost when a process has been running less than MAX_SLEEP_AVG has 
been tweaked and consequently is more aggressive.
Slight code rearrangement to have one less if.. branch.
