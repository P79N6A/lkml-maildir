Unfortunately in the software case if you want it in the base kernel you
are bolting new manifolds on everyones car at once, and someone is going
to have an engine explode as a result.
Ext3 already has enough back compatiblity that you can replace the
engine with a horse, we don't need any more in it thank you.
