Subject: Still accepting drivers for 2.4 ?

Hello
I've written a device driver for a 3rd party's product so that I might use it on my machine.
However I am still using the 2.4, so naturally that is the kernel the driver works with.
Should/could I submit it here, or would I be better off distributing it on my own?
Once I port it to 2.6 I will read up on the how-to of submitting, but I was unsure if 'the
community' still had interest in 2.4 kernel drivers.
Sincerely
ray
