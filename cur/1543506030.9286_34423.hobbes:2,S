I uploaded a new bigmem-2.3.13-M patch here:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/2.3.13/bigmem-2.3.13-M
(the raw-io must be avoided with bigmem enabled, since the protection I
added in get_page_map() doesn't work right now)
If you'll avoid to do raw-io the patch should be safe and ready to use.
Thanks.
Andrea
