Just a general question, not sure if this is exactly the correct place to
ask but is there a kernel patch (or unofficial one) that allows linux to
mount a partition that was formatted under AIX 3.2 ?
Theres a IBM RS/6000 C10 (i think) that has either had a controller
failure or a failure somewhere ont he main board.. And we are trying to
figure out a way where we could possibly rescue the data from it without
the use of another compatable box...
Any ideas?
Regards, Jim.
