Right. 
/* Tasklets --- multithreaded analogue of BHs.
   Main feature differing them of generic softirqs: tasklet
   is running only on one CPU simultaneously.
   Main feature differing them of BHs: different tasklets
   may be run simultaneously on different CPUs.
   Properties:
   * If tasklet_schedule() is called, then tasklet is guaranteed
     to be executed on some cpu at least once after this.
^^^^ Crap. Not equivalent. Must be guaranteed to run on the same cpu.
   * If the tasklet is already scheduled, but its excecution is still not
     started, it will be executed only once.
   * If this tasklet is already running on another CPU (or schedule is called
     from tasklet itself), it is rescheduled for later.
   * Tasklet is strictly serialized wrt itself, but not
     wrt another tasklets. If client needs some intertask synchronization,
     he makes it with spinlocks.
