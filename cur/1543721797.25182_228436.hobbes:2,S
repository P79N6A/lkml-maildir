apologies for assasinating this thread ...
I did an 'extensive' search with google (you do not want 
to know how many hits you get with 'sparse') and read 
most postings on the sparse mailinglist (linux-sparse),
found the freshmeat project pointing me to the 'new url'
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/sparse/
 where I can
download 'sparse-2003-11-27.tar.gz', then found out that
there should be a maintained (up to date) version of it at 
   
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/
but what I find there, seems of no use to me ...
(I'm no bitkeeper person) so I'm still looking for an url
where I can get a recent .tar to install that beast.
can anybody point me in the right direction, please?
TIA,
Herbert
