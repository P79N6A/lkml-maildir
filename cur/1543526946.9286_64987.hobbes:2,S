If you telnet to the server, then hang up, everything is fine. I tried
to find out how many 'hits' per second the server could take. I just
connected then closed the socket in a loop. The result was connections
'forever' so it may be some kind of race. The original code, before
I added the exception-flags hack follows. During the fast connect/
disconnect select() does not return so the server sleeps forever.
If I add the exception hack, select does return, however the appropriate
rfds bit is not set so the procedure loops forever, eating CPU time.
The procedure write_all() writes all the data to the fd, returning
zero if everything went okay. It uses write() in a loop, indexing
through the data.

                sfd = MAX(fd, ma) +1;

                    FD_SET(fd, &mem->rfds);

                        pty_bug = mem->buf;
                        if((i > 1) && (*pty_bug == '\0'))
                        {
                            i--;
                            pty_bug++;
                        }
                        if(write_all(fd, pty_bug, i))

                exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
The code contains a hack as a work-around to the pty bug that was
introduced when Linux changed the ptys. Data read from the master
pty contains a leading ASCII null-byte, even if the user of the
slave pty sets the terminal to raw mode. You don't see the leading
zero on most terminals but it certainly messes up a binary file
transfer using `rz` and/or `sz` with telnet. I really wish this
was fixed also. This was reported just after the addition of the
Unix-98 ptys.
