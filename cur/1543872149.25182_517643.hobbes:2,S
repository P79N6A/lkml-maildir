When we're about two weeks away from a product release and you are 
threatening to unmerge or block our code because we didn't create an 
abstract interrupt controller, we re-used the APIC and IO-APIC, this is 
uber rocket science.  We've been doing things this way, with public 
patches for over a year, and you've even been CC'd on some of the 
discussions.  So it is a little late to tell us - "redesign your 
hypervisor, or else.."

Why?  This is your own invention, as you think it would make life 
easier.  It doesn't - you still have real hardware to deal with, and 
your code will always be designed to operate on silicon with these 
hardwired assumptions.  Breaking away from that can actually make the 
code more complex, both in the hypervisor and in Linux.

Which we have done.  And now you refuse to give any feedback on 
technical points, but maintain an objection to the way we have done it.

We faithfully emulate lapic, io_apic, the pit, pic, and a normal 
interrupt subsystem.  We can't magically stop using these things because 
we have to support traditional full virtualization.  Which means any 
version of Linux, virtual interrupt controller or not, is going to boot 
up, find these things, and try to use them.  So for a paravirt kernel, 
either we have to disable each of these things in the Linux code or just 
re-use them.
So we re-use them.  We don't even change their semantics.  Where we get 
into trouble is the fact that only the lapic can deliver per-cpu timer 
IRQs, and we need to provide a better time abstraction than TSC.  So we 
need a time device, but there is no way to implement it in the 
traditional hardware model.
And I ask again for your feedback on which approach you think is correct:
1) Rewrite the interrupt subsystem of our hypervisor, making it 
incompatible with full virtualization, so that we can support an 
abstract interrupt controller with a "clean" interface
2) Reuse the same method that HPET, PIT and other time clients in i386 
use - the global_clock_event pointer which allows you to wrest control 
back from the APIC and reuse the lapic_events local clockevents.
3) Create a new low level interrupt handler for the per-cpu VMI timer 
IRQs instead of re-using the APIC handler
4) Use the irq APIs to allocate IRQ-0 as a percpu IRQ, then change the 
IO-APIC code so it can know not to convert this PIC IRQ into a IO-APIC 
edge IRQ.
5) Disable the io-apic code entirely in paravirt mode.  Rather than 
change it, merge a parallel copy of it into the VMI code
 so that we can use the 99% of the code we need, with the one bugfix for 
#4 above
6) Disable the apic code entirely in paravirt mode.  Rather than change 
it, merge a parallel copy of into the VMI code so that we can use the 
90% of the code we need, with changes to the LVT0 timer handling.
7) For SMP only, allocate a non-shared IO-APIC IRQ, then after the 
IO-APIC is initialized, magically switch this to a percpu handler and 
start delivering local timer interrupts via this IRQ.
8) Create a pie-in-the-sky single interrupt source, reserve an IDT 
vector for it (or steal the lapic timer slot), and use the irq apis to 
set it up to be handled as a per-cpu interrupt.  This actually sounds 
pretty good, to me.  The only problem is we will need to switch the 
timer IRQ from IRQ 0 to this vector when the APIC is initialized, but I 
think we already have all the machinery we need to handle that.
9) ???
This is a serious question, I would appreciate a serious response 
instead of snide comments about the crappiness of our interface and our 
code.  Which do help a little, because by process of elimination,  we 
can rule out the approaches you don't like.  But it would be more 
productive if we could carry on a traditional dialogue and I could just 
ask a question and you could answer and vice versa.
