  randy dunlap was gracious enough to post my proposed
patch to clean up the filesystems config menu.  the patch
(80K uncompressed) is online at;
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kconfig/kconfig-fs-2.5.59b.patch
currently, it still has leading asterisks in front of the
config entries to support editing in emacs outline mode, 
but future patches will have these removed.
  it should patch cleanly against stock 2.5.59.
  comments?
