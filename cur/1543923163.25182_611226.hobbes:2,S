I appreciate that Xen is about 2 years behind the curve and only uses
2.6.18, but what do you expect us on this list to do with this patch?
2.6.18 is no longer maintained: it doesn't get -stable updates anymore.
(And if it did, I doubt this kind of change would be suitable for a
-stable release anyway)...
so the first step really is to make a patch against 2.6.24-rc or a
later git version.... because then and only then is your patch
something that anyone else here can DO something with ...
(it's like the tree in the forest... if a tree falls in a forest, but
everyone moved to a different forest 2 years ago, does it make a sound?)
