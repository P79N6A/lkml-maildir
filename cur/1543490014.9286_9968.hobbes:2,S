I got a number of responses to this question, so I will summarize them here. 
(I hope this is OK with everyone that has participated.) I also have how other 
OS cope.

This is true, but other Unix OS are slightly different. See below.

In that case, would it be possible to try another directory first (eg the 
mount-point, which cannot be deleted anyway), and only revert to the same 
directory if the first attempt fails? Then again, it probably would be easier 
(and more portable) just to fix dpkg. From memory, Unix operating
systems are the only ones that support weird operations like deleting
an open file anyway.

So maybe I should file a wishlist bug against dpkg... ie it should wait for 
the background process to exit (probably tar, but I haven't checked) before it 
deletes its temp files that are still being written to at the same
time...
Just out of interest, I wanted to see what happens with other OS:
- Ultrix and OSF/1: The .nfs* file *can* be deleted. Any further writes to 
this file result in "stale filehandle" error.
- SunOS 5.7: rm .nfs* returns no errors, but the file is not deleted, hence
the directory cannot be deleted.
- Linux: rm .nfs* returns with an error.
