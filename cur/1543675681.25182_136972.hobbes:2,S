OK.  I really have no experience or knowledge about this stuff to argue
this point.

VMware 2.0.4.
When the kernel boots, it detects the local APIC, however when it comes
time to calibrate the APIC timer interrupts, the kernel "stops"/hangs.

Normal boot until here:
Using local APIC timer interrupts.
calibrating APIC timer ...
..... CPU clock speed is 1658.7651 MHz.
..... host bus clock speed is 0.0000 MHz.
cpu: 0, clocks: 0, slice: 0

UP.
