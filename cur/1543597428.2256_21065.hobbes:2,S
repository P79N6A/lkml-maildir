In a tree-structured filesystem, checksums on everything would only
cost you space similar to the number of pointers you have. Whenever
a non-leaf node points to a child, it can hold a checksum for that
child as well.
This gives a very reliable way to spot filesystem errors, including
corrupt data blocks.
