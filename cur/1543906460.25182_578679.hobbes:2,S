Subject: gcc fixed size char array initialization bug - known?

Hi
I've run across the following gcc "feature":
	char c[4] = "01234";
gcc emits a nice warning
warning: initializer-string for array of chars is too long
But do a
	char c[4] = "0123";
and - a wonder - no warning. No warning with gcc 3.3.2, 3.3.5, 3.4.5, 
4.1.2. I was told 4.2.x does produce a warning. Now do a
	struct {
		char c[4];
		int i;
	} t;
	t.i = 0x12345678;
	strcpy(t.c, c);
and t.i is silently corrupted. Just wanted to ask if this is known, 
really...
Thanks
Guennadi
