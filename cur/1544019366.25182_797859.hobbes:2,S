This sounds like a very widely known and discussed firmware problem.  It
happens with Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, as well as various NAS boxes.
It is seagate's fault.  Of course I had only seen it mentioned for the
500GB, 750GB, 1TB and 1.5TB drives.  Somehow yours seems like it should
be a different series, but then again why should a firmware bug not be
duplicated on all their drives.
One discussion is here: 
http://techreport.com/discussions.x/15863
Seriously annoying for raid users of course when a drive falls out of
the raid for no good reason.
I seem to recall some people had found that if you disabled some part of
the drive caching the problem seemed to go away (as did a lot of the
drive's performance of course).
