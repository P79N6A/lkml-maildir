Thank you all for helping. I'm sorry I didn't make clear initially
that this (aliasing net-pf-10 to off) was the first thing I tried. I
resorted to Google when it didn't work. I've tried it again but the
error-messages continue.  /lib/modules/modprobe.conf now has:
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         7341 Jan 30 15:26 modprobe.conf
   alias net-pf-1  unix
   alias net-pf-2  ipv4
   alias net-pf-3  ax25
   alias net-pf-4  ipx
   alias net-pf-5  appletalk
   alias net-pf-6  netrom
   alias net-pf-7  bridge
   alias net-pf-8  atm
   alias net-pf-9  x25
   alias net-pf-10 off
   alias net-pf-11 rose
   alias net-pf-12 decnet
and contains no other reference to net-pf-10. But still:
Jan 31 14:53:01 ohlone /USR/SBIN/CRON[1092]: (mail) CMD (  if [ -x /usr/lib/exim/exim3 -a -f /etc/exim/exim.conf ]; then /usr/lib/exim/exim3 -q ; fi)
Jan 31 14:53:01 ohlone kernel: request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- net-pf-10. error = 256
for every time exim runs.
Others have reported the same effect, e.g:
http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/lfs-hackers/2004-January/000297.html
This didn't happen in 2.6.0 (or earlier).
This is a very small problem indeed, of course. It's just weird ...
