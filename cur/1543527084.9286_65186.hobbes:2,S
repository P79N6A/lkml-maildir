Ok. Just think of some kind of portable personal assistant. You
are interested in very low energy consumption, therefore you
switch it of while not using it. If you need some information
from the PA, switch it on once again and you want to boot it 
really very fast. To implement such behaviour you have at least
two possibilities:
(1) You really boot each time the PA is switched on.
(2) You shut down the PA and save its state to persistent storage
    (as in hibernation, but you can do it more intelligent using
    swap as a first stage 'hibernation' partition and write only
    the kernel to a dedicated hibernation partition. When starting
    up you only restore the kernel. The paging system will do
    the rest. On demand :-)). See Gabor Kuti's software suspend
    (
http://falcon.sch.bme.hu/~seasons/linux
).
I leave to question regarding the type of persistent storage open :-)
BTW, I consider (2) also of interest for Desktop boxes.
Thomas.
