Can you show some example user code for this? I'm not sure I get how
it would work
sched_setsched(RR..)
loop
     do user stuff as Rt
     syscall -- drop out of rt
     drop back into rt
     goto loop
?

My measurements show exceptional timing stability under very light load.
And terrible under heavy/moderate load.
