Yeah, sure. Even in 2.2.4-pre6 I noticed lots of unused buffers
floating around, so I applied the patch as soon as Linus issued
it. It's definitely needed.

I doubt it's the inode allocation that makes trouble, too, but it was

Problem with "Out of memory ..." errors is that they're very rare, so
it's hard to track the real reason. Probably we need some debugging
printk's at strategic places throughout kernel to see what's producing 
bad behaviour.
