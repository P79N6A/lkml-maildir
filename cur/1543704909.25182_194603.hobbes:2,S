Yes. I assume you want _some_ locking anyway, at least within that 
particular device driver (you don't want to have an irq handler touch the 
device at the same time you are doing this thing), so any such spinlock 
would have disabled preemption anyway.

Again, this is all depending on hardware implementation issues. It is 
entirely possible that "read_pcix_error()" has to do some kind of 
synchronization to make sure that any async operations have finished and 
all errors have been accounted for.
Again, this is the whole reason for doing the separate "clear/read"  
phases in error handling - exactly because hardware implementation may
make error handling fairly heavy-weight, so you don't want to do it on a
per-IO basis, but rather on a "per transaction" basis.
