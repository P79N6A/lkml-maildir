Yeah, but there's a flip side to this too:  if no one uses the data, no one 
will complain when it's wrong.  If Linux starts making it easy to see this 
stuff, there's a chance system vendors will start taking an extra 5 min. 
before shipment to make sure that the BIOS info is up to date...
OTOH, I'm not sure which is worse, bad data or no data.
