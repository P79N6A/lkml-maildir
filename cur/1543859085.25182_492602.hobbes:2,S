Indeed it should. Thanks for noticing that!

For normal users, yes, it is the only way (yet) to use cfag12864b
(through a framebuffer). However, I divided the code in logical blocks
so it is more modular (easier understanding, scalability...), so
anyone can easily add a new way to control the LCD without worring
about other unrelated stuff the code.
