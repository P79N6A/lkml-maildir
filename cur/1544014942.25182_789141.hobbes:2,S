I want to move the Linux-ACPI code and the ACPICA core
out of drivers/ simply because they are not drivers,
and never will be.
The actual ACPI drivers, OTOH, would remain in drivers/acpi/.
So looking around...
arch/ doesn't make sense for something shared by x86 and ia64
firmware/ seems to be about software that doesn't run on the CPU.
kernel/ is evidently sacred ground.                 
So I suggest "platform/acpi/" or if we can't imagine any
other cross architecture platform code code that isn't device drivers,
then simply "acpi/"  Would you find that less offensive?
thanks,
