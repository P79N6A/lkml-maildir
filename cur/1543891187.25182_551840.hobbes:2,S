Subject: [PATCH 2.6.16] Fix NULL bio crash in loop worker thread
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/1/45

After LOOP_SET_FD/LOOP_CLR_FD combo loop device's queue gets request
handler which is persistent.
After, say
        mount -t iso9660 /dev/loop0 /mnt        # sic
this request handler is called directly with
a) ->lo_state being Lo_unbound
b) ->lo_pending being zero
Error path in loop_make_request() completes ->lo_bh_done completion
which is persistent as well.
Now, let's start worker thread as usual. It'll set ->lo_pending to 1,
don't wait for completion because it was already completed (brokenly),
and will not get out of infinite loop because of ->lo_pending. Loop
device doesn't have bios at this point and triggers BUG_ON.
So, don't complete ->lo_bh_done when loop device isn't setup fully.
Steps to reproduce:
	#!/bin/sh -x
	ISO=1.iso
	mount -o loop $ISO /mnt
	umount /mnt
	mount -t iso9660 /dev/loop0 /mnt        # sic
	mount -o loop $ISO /mnt
