I've got a Logitech Trackman Marble trackball with a wheel. The last time
i used netscape (yesterday) twiddling the wheel away from me moved
text in Netscape up, twiddling the wheel towards me did the opposite.
Now it's reversed! Which is really disorientating :)
The trackball is USB, so i'm using kernel 2.3.36, i recently upgraded
my kernel from 2.3.31 where i know it worked.
Does anyone have even the vaguest hint as to why this might have happened?
