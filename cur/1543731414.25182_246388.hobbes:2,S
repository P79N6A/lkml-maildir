Send me a patch to do so, and I will apply it (must include userspace
files so that hotplug can load them properly.)
The last time we went around about this I rejected it as we were in a
stable kernel series.  As that is now not true, I'm open to the patch.
It's not an idealogical issue for me, given Linus's statements about
firmware in the kernel, but I do agree that it is a better thing as we
have used up less kernel memory.
thanks,
