Yes, because otherwise it wouldn't work in 2.6.11.11 either. My userspace environment is identical
between 2.6.12 an 2.6.11.11, but the RELATED and ESTABLISHED packets aren't forwarded across the
bridge in 2.6.12.
And no, I haven't tried recompiling my userspace iptables tools. Why would this make any
difference? "iptables -L -v" reports exactly what I expect to see.
Cheers,
Chris
