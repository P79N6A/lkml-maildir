Hallo!
You could try:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
It's possible that you have chosen "power_save".
You can see possible settings in 
sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
Try "performance"!
Then you should get your 1,4 GHz.
But be aware, that this is not powersaving!
Maybe you can play around with it.
A good possibility is to install an userspace application for governing
the cpu-speed lik cpufreqd
