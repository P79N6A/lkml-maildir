Doesn't help --- you still need to look up the physical block numbers
in order to clear the allocation bitmaps for indirect blocks, so we're
going to need those lookups anyway.  Once you have that, looking for a
given fixed offset in the buffer cache is no harder than doing so in
the page cache.

No argument there, but a per-inode dirty buffer list would do the
same.  Neither of these are overwhelming arguments for a move.
