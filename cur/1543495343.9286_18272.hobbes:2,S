I'm also intending to at some point to implement a fieldbus protocol (Profibus)
that runs over RS485. If we can design a simple way for user-space libraries to
send and receive whole packets over RS485 media, then it could be used by many
such projects.
I was intending to do it as a line discipline, although the 'normal' line 
discipline behaviour isn't good enough for synchronous operation. However, the 
N_HDLC line discipline which turned up in 2.2.x recently may well prove to be 
an extremely good model for what we want.
Basically, the Profibus definition of a 'packet' is a sequence of bits which 
is preceded and followed by 33 idle bits (3 characters @ _8n1_). That's about 
the only information that needs to be passed down to that layer - the amount 
of time to leave as a 'packet gap'. What about your system?
What hardware are you using for RS485 communication? I'm looking at the 
Comtrol RocketPort 485 cards, but haven't yet been approved to actually go 
ahead and spend real money on the project.

For people interested in Profibus on Linux, we already have some intelligent 
IO cards from Applicom (www.applicom-int.com) working under Linux in a 
production environment. Let me know if you want more information.
