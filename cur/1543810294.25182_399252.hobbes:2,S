I'm going to let most of the last 8 hours' emails float by without reply, but 
think I should comment here.
I don't believe I've ever seen an email from Andrew stopping a merge, and I 
shouldn't have, because I've never asked him to merge it. Being the 
perfectionist that I am, I've sought to get it as stable, reliable and 
comment-clean as I reasonably could before merging.

Nigel
