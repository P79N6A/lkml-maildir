So this does the device node that we pass in, plus all the nodes that
come after it in its parent's list of children.  On that basis I
expected you to pass in the first child of the EADS bridge, but I see:

My understanding is that pe_dn will end up pointing to the device node
for the EADS bridge.  Shouldn't you pass in pe_dn->child here, or
alternatively rearrange __eeh_mark_slot to do the node you give it
plus its children (recursively)?
Two other comments about __eeh_mark_slot: (1) despite the comment, the
function doesn't do anything to any pci_dev or pci_driver (not that it
should be touching any pci_driver), and (2) a recursive function can't
really be inline (unless gcc is smart enough to turn arbitrary
recursive functions into iterative functions, which I doubt :).
Regards,
Paul.
