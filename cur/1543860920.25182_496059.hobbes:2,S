What's (technically) the problem with changing the gcc default?
Alternatively we could make the error deterministic in various ways. Start
st_ino numbering from 4G (except for a few special ones maybe such
as root/mounts). Or make old and new programs look differently at the
ELF level or by sys_personality() and/or check against a "ino64" mount
flag/filesystem feature. Lots of possibilities.
