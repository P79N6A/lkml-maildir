I can't reproduce it here easily as well.  Yesterday I had a
locked-up console and had to hard-reboot the machine due to
this (it was far from first time when I've hit this issue),
but "on-demand reproducing" don't work (the uptime on that
host was about 100 days, and I had to do some repartition -
hence remount-ro to copy consistent data to other place -
maybe during that 100 day there was something... ;)
And I wasn't able to reproduce it on 2.6.24 so far, as well
(this one is only used on a test machine so far).
I'll keep trying ;)
Thanks for your support!
