Both of these sound like redirection, not piping.

This is definitely redirection, not piping. As far as I know the
implementation of redirection in the kernel remains unchanged: certainly
the need to buffer piped data doesn't exist in this case, and since the
redesign was of the buffering, this is probably not your problem :)

Indeed.

You should be able to open it as root and read from it as another user:
i.e., your technique above shouldn't break. (I'd hope.)

What we need these days is a stable, fast, anti-aliased root beer
with dynamic shading. Not that you can let just anybody have root.
