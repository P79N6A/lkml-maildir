Hi Kernel Folks,
I am facing some problem while applying patch to the 2.6.9 kernel.
I have done following to apply the patch:
# patch -p1 < ../../Patches/patch-ext3
But getting following things:
missing header for unified diff at line 3 of patch
(Stripping trailing CRs from patch.)
can't find file to patch at input line 3
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|#--- ../A_CLEAN_FILE_SYSTEM/jbd/commit.c       2006-02-25
11:43:19.000000000 -0600
|#+++ commit.c  2006-03-29 20:53:29.000000000 -0600
--------------------------
File to patch:
Can anyone suggest what I am doing wrong while applying this patch or if the
command is correct then why patch is giving the above errors.
Any help can be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Yogesh
