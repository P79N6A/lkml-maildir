IIRC pcmcia_request_io() fails to dynamically allocate IO windows for PCMCIA 
cards because find_io_region returns NULL. 
OTOH, as Magnus noted, the memory windows are static:
 * Because of the lacking offset register we must map the whole card.
 * We assign each memory window PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE address space.
 * Make sure there is (PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE * PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_NO
 * * PCMCIA_SOCKETS_NO) bytes at PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_BASE.
 * The i/o windows are dynamically allocated at PCMCIA_IO_WIN_BASE.
 * They are maximum 64KByte each...
socket[i].socket.features = SS_CAP_PCCARD | SS_CAP_MEM_ALIGN | SS_CAP_STATIC_MAP;
socket[i].socket.io_offset = 0;

OK, will fix.
