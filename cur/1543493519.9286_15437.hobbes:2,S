He should have stopped to say that, unless he is still using boring
out-of-date Linux commercial distributions instead of (b)leading edge
linux material.
(Btw, the NCR driver use the SHIRQ flag since day one).

Linux was messed up for IRQ sharing due to the SCSI subsystem having
chosen SA_INTERRUPT at the beginning, and people who had implemented such
kind of stupid things you described (they called work-around) just added
shit to shit, in my opinion.

If you elect to change interrupt flags on a driver, you must ensure that
interrupt masking is fine for the new interrupt flags. For example, if you
remove the SA_INTERRUPT flag, you must check that the tampered driver does
mask interrupt when interrupts needs to be masked, or make appropriate
changes to the driver code.
