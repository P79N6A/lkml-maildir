Give me a real-life case where that happens, and I might care. I dare you.
The pid space is not a uniform distribution, which your made-up-example
depends on. So you usually walk the 100000 threads _once_, and then you
don't have to walk them again for quite a long time.
And guys, if this is a performance problem for some extreme site, the fix
is truly trivial:
	echo $((0x7fffffff)) > /proc/sys/max_pid
and you're done.
You're completely making up a problem that is not a problem in real life.  
Come back to me when the above doesn't work _in_practice_ and somebody is
actually bitten, and maybe I'll care.
Until then, all you're doing is mental masturbation.
