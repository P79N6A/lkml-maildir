Hmm, you really want to weakly align it: you don't care if something follows it on
the cacheline, (ie. don't make it into an array, but it'd be nice if other
things could share the cacheline) in UP.
I don't think there's a way of doing that short of using asm?
It'd be nice if someone volunteered benchmarks.  struct tcp_hashinfo takes
*two* whole cachlines, for example:

The decl already puts the non-read-heavy members __cacheline_aligned:
extern struct tcp_hashinfo {
	...
	rwlock_t __tcp_lhash_lock ____cacheline_aligned;
*This* should probably be ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp, yes?
Thanks for the reply!
Rusty.
