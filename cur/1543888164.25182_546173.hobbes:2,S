Well, my stand uptil now has been to consider as many options as
possible. I have certainly not married myself to just one particular way
of doing this -- but I bet that the one way that I do _dislike_, the dummy
module one, would not be found tasteful / best by most people around
(yourself included, as you say).

The whole point is to at least _consider_ other alternatives. And I've
found your attitude so far to have been extremely blocking / difficult.
