Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.5 ISA DMA hang on ALI 15x3

Precedence: bulk

Hello World,
This little patch enables the workaround for the ISA DMA bug on ALi15x3
chipsets with the PCI-ISA bridge.
CHANGES:
Changed file: $KERNELROOT/drivers/pci/quirks.c
There is a DMA bug in the PCI-ISA host bridge of the ALi15x3 chipset.
The use of this DMA causes a hang.
The OSS and ALSA modules for the OPL3/SA2 and OPL3/SAx sound chip use
this DMA which causes a complete hang.
This combination of chipset and soundchip is found in the whole Acer
Extensa laptop series.
The patch adds the chipset mentioned above to the main table of quirks.
The patch was originally written by Angelo Di Filippo
<adifilip@ubiquity.it> as a patch for Kernel 2.3.45. I adapted it to
Kernel 2.4.5
