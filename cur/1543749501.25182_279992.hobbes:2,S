Yep, but ip_queue_xmit doesn't call itself recursively. Someone 
must be doing it. And that's likely the bridge code.
BTW not all of these entries are probably true, there can 
be a lot of false positives.

Ok, since this report seems to be for a totally non standard
severly hacked up kernel I suppose nothing from it can be concluded for
the mainline kernel. Thanks for clearing this up.
Note to the original poster: when you report a bug with a patched
kernel always mention it.
