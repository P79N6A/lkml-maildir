Alan,
	I have found the kernel version which contains the scsi code that makes
the system to crash. The 2.1.86 works, the 2.1.87 not.  I have tried to change
all the scsi related files from 2.1.87 to 2.1.86 to find which one causes the
kernel to crash. The linux/drivers/scsi/scsi_errors.c file of the 2.1.86 version
in the 2.1.87 tree makes the whole thing works.
For memory, it's about to crash the 2.1.x kernels when using a aha1505 scsi
card (with the 152x driver). The crash occurs when we try to mount a Audio CD
on the scsi CD drive. The 2.1.86 returns an error, and 2.1.87+ return a kernel
panic.
The 2.1.86 contains
       sigfillset(&current->blocked);
which is replaced by
       siginitsetinv(&current->blocked, SHUTDOWN_SIGS);
in the 2.1.87 scsi_errors.c file.
I let the real hackers to undestand why... However, I think the aha152x driver
badly handles the 1505 card. But I do not know if it crashes with a real 1520
scsi card (Anyone ?). So is it a problem of the 1505 card or of the 152x family
cards ???
Hope this will help.
