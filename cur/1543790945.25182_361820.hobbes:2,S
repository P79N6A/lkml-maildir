Freshly built 2.6.14-git3, upon logging on virtual consoles
 (tty2, tty3) I get this on the virtual console (not in dmesg,
 not in /var/log/messages):
KDGKBSENT: Operation not permitted
KDGKBSENT failed at index 0:
The messages seem harmless, I can startx fine and have
 so far no problem from the X session started from that tty.
