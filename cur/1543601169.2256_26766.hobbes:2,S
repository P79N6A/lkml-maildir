I might say that you could have tried a complete different make drive. who
says that the 75 MB IBM is ok ?
maybe the same design mistake was made or so. just a thought. 
options to see if something weird isn't due to hardware could be to not
use dma, change pio modes, e.g. relax the drive settings. 
not that I say IBM's drive is bad, it's just a thought.
