Also: to let a program believe it was creating files which are used to 
hold the written data. Otherwise /dev/null would probably be the solution.

I think what is going to happen is that files created behave as if they 
are the result of a mknod resulting in a /dev/null clone.

The directory structure can persist, it's the writing of data which can 
be avoided.
Real example:
A program which reads log files and prepares a whole raft of reports in 
a directory specified. If you just want to see the summary (stdout) and 
exception notices (stderr) having a nulldir would avoid the disk space 
and i/o load if you were just looking at the critical output rather than 
the analysis.
Yes, if this was an original program requirement it would or should have 
been a feature. Real world cases sometimes use tools in creative ways.
