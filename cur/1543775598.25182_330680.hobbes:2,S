There's a plan to make this work.  The kernel ABI has alredy been
prepared for this, it would be relatively little work to implement.
But I usually wait with something like this until people actually
start asking for this feature.

Good point.  I'll fix that.

This too has been discussed.  The last half year has been mostly spend
with ironing out problems cought during integration.  Sometime this
summer I'll start implementing these new features (inode based API,
locking, userspace NFS serving, maybe shared writable mmap support).
