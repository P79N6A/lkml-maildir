Sorry to sound a bit bewildered, but would be the next best thing for me
to do on this?, 
I have also been advised by Jonathan Corbet 
to use dd to copy your card to disk with an offset of 25
looking through the info and man pages for dd, I can find no mention of
offset at all, the next best thing I could find was the command option
'skip'
Sorry to sound abit overwhelmed.
