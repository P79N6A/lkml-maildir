Sorry, have not noticed what you were asking about.
Yes, rc2 seems to suspend/resume fine.
And after reverting
     revert commit 559bbe6cbd0d8c68d40076a5f7dc98e3bf5864b2.
     revert commit 208c70a45624400fafd7511b96bc426bf01f8f5e.
r3 does, too.
I just waited a couple of minutes after suspend to ram and it stays suspended.
