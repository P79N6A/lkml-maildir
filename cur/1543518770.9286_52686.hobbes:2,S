Hello All,
 I am experiencing complete system lockup rather too frequently with and SMP
kernel
2.2.13. It seems to happen just after authentication on dialin when pppd is
setting up the IP
connection. Has anyone else seen this? What could be the cause? Dialout
using ISDN/ppp seems
to be fine.
Thanks in advance,
Nicholas Waltham
