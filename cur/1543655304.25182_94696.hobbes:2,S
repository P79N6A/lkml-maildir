Subject: status of HPT374 support in 2.4.20 and 2.5.50

Hi,
I just bought a Highpoint Rocketraid 404 controler. To my suppirce I 
found that
the kernel I was using does not like it one bit. The kernel entered a 
kernel panic/BUG
in file hpt666.c:1031. The kernel was a Redhat stock kernel 
2.4.18-18.8.0smp.
Not afraid to build my own kernel I tried:
- 2.4.20; which also stoped with a kernel panic.
- 2.4.20-ac1; this kernel boots just fine. It even sees the controller 
but does not detect
the drive.
- 2.5.46; sees the controler but no drive
- 2.5.50; sees the controler but no drive
Google told me that there are successes with the HPT374 contoller(kernel 
2.5.46),
but thus far not for me.
Some info about by system:
motherboard: msi k7d; dual amd athlon mp 2000+
onboard ide controller: AMD7441
other pci ide controller: PDC20267
Please help,
regards,
Jorg de Jong
