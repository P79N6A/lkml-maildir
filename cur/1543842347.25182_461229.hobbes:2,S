The spec says that devices can put additional restriction on supported 
cacheline size (IIRC, the example was something like power of two >= or 
<= certain size) and should ignore (treat as zero) if unsupported value 
is written.  So, there might be need for more low level driver 
involvement which knows device restrictions, but I don't know whether 
such devices exist.
