Hi.
I was wondering if anyone could guide me as to where to find the code
handling the interrupts with the different hardware devices (floppy disk,
hard disk, ethernet), and how the bus mastership and bus control is handled
by the CPU with the contribution of the Kernel.
I appreciate it very much. Thanks.
