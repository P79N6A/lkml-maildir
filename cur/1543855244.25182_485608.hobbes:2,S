Complaining about the messages in your log doesn't do any good.  You need 
to address the real problem, which is why your keyboard keeps needing to 
be reset.
To get more information about the problem, you could try building a kernel 
with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG turned on.  Perhaps even more informative, you could 
use the usbmon facility (see the instructions in 
Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt).  To keep the trace simple, you should 
unplug all USB devices except the one you're testing.
