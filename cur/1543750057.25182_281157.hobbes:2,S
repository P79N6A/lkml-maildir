Subject: 2.6.10 breaks xconsole

Running kernel 2.6.10, xconsole always displays: Couldn't open console.
xconsole works fine in the identical setup with 2.6.9 and 2.4.28.
The permissions are set correctly:
crw-rw-r--  1 lars tty 5, 1 2004-12-25 13:17 /dev/console
xconsole won't work when run as either lars, a tty member, and even 
root. In all cases the message above is shown.
If I change permission to:
crw-rw-r--  1 root tty 5, 1 2004-12-25 13:17 /dev/console
xconsole can at least be run as root.
I guess this is related to this patch:
<od@suse.de>
	[PATCH] TIOCCONS security
Forcing xconsole to be run as root is not a good idea, IMHO.
