I use that all the time, through the scripts in Debian's "kernel-package":
	cd /usr/local/src/linux
	cp /boot/config-some-recent-version .config
	make oldconfig
	fakeroot make-kpkg kernel_image modules_image
	dpkg -i ../kernel-image...deb ../alsa-modules-...deb
I find this quite comfortable: I always know where to find old configs, have
a matching System.map installed, can clean up old kernels and modules easily
etc.
