    Basically there will still be a use for the block devices as far
    as there are fsck and other userspace applications that want to
    use it.
You don't need block device for fsck, in fact some OS require you use
character devices (e.g. Solaris).
I'm not saying we don't need block devices, but I really don't see
much of a use for them once everything in in the page cache... I
assume this is why others have got rid of them completely.
