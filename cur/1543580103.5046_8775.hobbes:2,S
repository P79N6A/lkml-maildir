It _is_ initialised. To zero :)

-static struct tq_struct dummy_task;
+static struct tq_struct dummy_task /* = all zero */;

The reason for doing it that way was because there was no guarantee that 
scheduled tasks will be called in order. So you can't just stick a new task 
in the queue and assume that when it's completed the queue is flushed. 
Linus then changed that and made the eventd thread call tasks in order, but 
I believe the intention is still that we don't make that guarantee, so it 
may change at any point in the future.
