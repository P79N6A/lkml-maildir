I want to give some update here:
1. We finally hit the problem on a third system, with a total different
   setup and hardware. However, again high I/O load caused the problem
   and the affected filesystems were mounted with noatime.
2. I installed a recompiled kernel with just the two line patch from
   Richard Kennedy (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/2/89
). That system has 5
   days uptime now and counting. I believe the patch fixed the problem.
   However, I will continue running "vmstat 1" and the endless loop of
   "cat /proc/meminfo", just in case I am wrong.
Regards,
Matthias
