Subject: IPX over IPSec availablity?

I've got a customer who wants to set up a VPN with Linux and
IPSec.  Part of the setup requires having VPN access to a Novell
Netware server which runs on IPX only.  Is it possible with the
standard kernel + IPSec (freeswan) patches to have IPX tunnel
over the IPSec VPN as well?  They've got some serious database
stuff on Novell, and the main point of the VPN is accessing this
Novell server remotely.
If this isn't currently possible, are there any projects to
make it a reality at all?  Would a 2.3 kernel help at all?
Any help and/or suggestions would be appreciated greatly.
