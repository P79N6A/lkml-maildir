HI,
I was just compiling kernel 2.5.11.
compiling this kernel with unix.o and nfsd.o as modules,
then modprobe gives me the message
unresolved symbol  path_lookup
Please note that compiling them statically does work.
loading the module exportfs.o does taint the kernel (??)
More, the system hangs at boot befor init runs agetty.
Hope this helps
Luigi
