There are more queues than just the device queue, e.g. TCP's write/retransmit
queue.  If the application uses big writes that is perfectly normal. TCP
keeps the packets because it is waiting in slow start for the other end
to open the window. If you want to measure the qdisc qlen you have to use
tc qdisc with rtnetlink.
