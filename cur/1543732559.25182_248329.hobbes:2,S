Ok.. so if I wanted to send an event (that included data at event time)
from a driver for a particular device, I would send the event with the
send_kevent() call and create and maintain an attribute for that
specific event. In order for an application to receive the data for the
event, the driver would need to store the data for that event somewhere
and keep it. Unless there's a write attribute to tell me it's been read,
I must maintain it or write over it if the same event occurs again. 
Is this how it's supposed to work? 
Even though 1) there won't be many events and 2) few events will include
data - don't you think this is a bit too much development overhead for
the driver? 
If you had the payload with the event, you could fire and forget. It
would be fewer steps for the driver and require less management and
storage.
Thanks,
Dan
