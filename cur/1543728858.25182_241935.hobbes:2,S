Subject: TG3 doesn't work in kernel 2.4.27

Hello,
I'm using tg3.o with DHCP and PXE boot environment
and I updated from 2.4.26 to 2.4.27,
but tg3.o became not working with IBM BladeCenter.
I think tg3.o in 2.4.27 is generating something broken arp.
When I run 'arp' in the DHCP server (who doesn't use tg3.o),
the entry with <incomplete> status appears.
The IP address which has the <incomplete> status is
the DHCP client's (who is using tg3.o in 2.4.27).
The workaround I took is to replace tg3.h and tg3.c
in 2.4.27 with the files in 2.4.26, and it seems working fine.
Thanks.
