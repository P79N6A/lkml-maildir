If you are accounting system calls then you don't wish to account internal
use of functions by the kernel. The app made _one_ syscall. You count it
once.

The internal calls are not syscalls. It makes total sense for the kernel to
use its own functions to implement things cleanly. Are you redirecting a
syscall or a function. The former you change the syscall table, the latter
you tweak the kernel to use a function pointer
