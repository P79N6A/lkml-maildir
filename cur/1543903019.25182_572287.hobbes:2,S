Thank you for catching.
It seems that this route will called at node-hotplug.
We tested node hotplug with our machine but haven't seen this.
The reason is maybe...
==
Currently, our firmware shows *to-be-added* nodes in SRAT at boot and
ia64 creates empty node against possible node. So, when we add node,
pgdat is already allocated and free_area_init_core() is not called at hotplug.
==
We need to use dummy firmware to test this route, sorry.
just thinking of:
I'm now considering to post patches for "specifies a zone which all hotaddes pages are
added to, MOVABLE, NORMAL, DMA..."If we do that, we may be able to avoid calling 
adjust_zone_range_for_zone_movable() (which touches this __meminit data) at hot-add.
Thanks,
