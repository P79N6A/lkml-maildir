OK.

This?
  1. create a new namespace
  2. bind /share/$USER to /share
  3. for each pair ($who, $what) such that
     /share/$USER/$who/$what exists, look
     in /share/$who/allowed for "peer $what
     $USER" or "slave $what $USER". If the
     former is found, rbind /share/$who/$what
     on /share/$USER/$who/$what; if the
     latter is found, do the same and
     follow with marking subtree under
     /share/$USER/$who/$what as slave.
  4. rbind /share/$USER to /share
  5. mark subtree under /share as private.
  6. umount -l /share
Well, someone please explain using short words, because I don't
understand at all.
Thanks,
Miklos
