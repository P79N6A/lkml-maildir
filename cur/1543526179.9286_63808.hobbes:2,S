I have followed with some interest the saga of devfs.
Complete with radical activists vs. Peter's questions of "what's it
for?"
Richard's patient explanations, and devoted support with timely patches.
There is a big time lesson here for people with a strong belief in their
idea.
Hat's off to Richard Gooch for his persistance and also to hpa.
There are many lessons here for contributors.
