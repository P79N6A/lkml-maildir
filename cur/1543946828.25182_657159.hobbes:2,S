I can't say I even come close to understand what's going on but
getting s2ram to work on my Dell M4300 has been a nightmare.  Even
after writing up how to get it to work (posted on the suspend-devel
list - but no one answered .. yet again), I'm having some quirks.
If I had a bizillion $'s, I'd buy an M4300 for Linus and give him a
million to get it to s2ram!  :p
Cheers,
