Not necessarily the one big simulation case (that's easy :) but what about
a typical case? Say, a multi-user system, hundreds of user processes,
various sizes and CPU times. Now, I come along and run my "malloc() bomb",
BUT modified so it has a busy loop in. Allocating, say, 4K every second.
After a couple of hours, maybe a day or two, it has chewed up many hours
of CPU time, and many Mb of RAM. It then looks like a legitimate process,
and other things die :-)

Any sufficiently well-coded bomb is indistinguishable from an innocent
unattended package :-)
