Just the kernel doesn't use it for that (except in idle) and user
space can't use it anyways because it's ring 0 only.

On the other hand wouldn't they expect mwait to be used if it's displayed
there? I don't see it as an obfuscation to make this clear.
Also it's not that someone's marketing strategy will depend on MWAIT
being displayed in cpuinfo. If it was something hyped like SSE* 
or 3dnow perhaps, but that's not the case.

Well older kernels don't know it, so actually a lot of people
learned to use another program to check anyways.

It seems a bit counterintuitive to add special code for CPUs
that do something right to avoid adding code to CPUs that do otherwise.

Ok, perhaps the second cpuid would be a bit ugly. Then do two
flags if you prefer that.
