Yeah, but that doesn't mean it makes sense on all those platforms.  The 
biggest problem with virt_to_bus (well, depending on who you talk to) is that 
it can't handle systems where the address translation must be done 
differently depending on *which* bus we're getting a bus address for.  Not 
sure what makes sense in this case though... is the DMA mapping interface 
appropriate?
