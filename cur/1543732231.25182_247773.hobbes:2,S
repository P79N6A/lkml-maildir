Results for 2.6.9-rc1 + your patch (time cat MAINTAINERS):
CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL=n
~1.27 s
CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL=y
~0.18 s
BUT with CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL enabled I get strange video 
"corruptions" (like bitmaps with random colors) that go away simply 
swithcing to another console and than back to the previous.
