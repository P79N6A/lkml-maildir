The third parameter is obsolete and should only be used to select _one_
of the tree suspend calls you will get.
Any additional suspend calls should _not_ create extra usage of this
parameter.  It's a left over from Pat's first driver model incarnation
which is specific to the platform device drivers.  (Mainly it exists
because no one can be bothered to clean it up.)
