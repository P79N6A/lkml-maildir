I assume that one of the main problems with doing -pre is that actually 
doing a real -rc isn't much fun -- I can certainly understand that 
sitting around twiddling your thumbs by decree every few weeks is not a 
good model.
You commented on the .k 4th level releases being an actual branch, BK 
wise. To not let the forced thumb-twiddling -rc period be a problem, 
this branch could happen at -rc1, after which Linus is again free to go 
merge up stuff into mainline for the next one, if he wants to.
That's to say, I propose Linus doesn't change _anything_ other than 
renaming his -rc's -pre's, and his final -rc1 (well, and making it a 
branch if -final isn't a branch now, sorry, not a clue).
The -rc branch then just sits there, and if nothing turns up that needs 
an -rc2, it gets released as final, and possibly onto .1, .2 and so on 
if useful or need be.
Now, coaching that -rc branch from -rc1 through maybe -rcN to -final and 
possibly beyond may not be something Linus wants to do. The -rc branch 
would by definition see _no_ activity other than the really needed so I 
don't believe it would be much of a burden time-wise, but it is in fact 
not unlike what Alan is already doing with -ac. So, if Linus doesn't 
want that job, Alan may? Or someone else?
Summarising:
- Linus:
	1) rename 2.6.N-rcX to 2.6.N-preX
	2) when you'd now release, branch off, release as -rc1
	3) go on with 2.6.(N+1)-pre1
- Linus, Alan, or whoever else wants the job:
	1) release -rc{2,3,...} only if needed.
	2) release 2.6.N
	3) do a 2.6.N.{1,2,...} only if needed.
Is this sane? The advantage is, real -pre's and -rc's which will get 
more people onboard testing -rc, and hopefully without annoying Linus 
with real no-changing -rc's. How many more, enough or not, remains to be 
  seen but certainly more.
Rene.
