I'm agree this, it is a very good Idea, to use Stings ;-). 
OK in this time, I use (missbrow) a existing descriptor over the 
modul-alias mechanism. The driver is very very spezially Protokoll,
with a z8530 driver on i386. I plan in the next time, to merge 
the 4..5 z8530 drivers to one modul, but i have only a i386 box.
thank's
