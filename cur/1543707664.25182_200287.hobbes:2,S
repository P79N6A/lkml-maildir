No.

I didn't have it, but compiled and changed. Yes, it works.

Slackware, with a cute rc.S. /bin/bash was also recompiled, shared:
$ ldd /bin/bash
        libreadline.so.4 => /usr/lib/libreadline.so.4 (0x4001c000)
        libhistory.so.4 => /usr/lib/libhistory.so.4 (0x40049000)
        libncurses.so.5 => /lib/libncurses.so.5 (0x40050000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4008f000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40092000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
Maybe the problem ? Does yours differ ?
bash from Slackware:
        libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0x4001c000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x4005c000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4005f000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
OK, I'll later boot with it and see if it works. If it does,
I'll run strace with the other.

I forgot to run it, but noticed there was a /dev/null, but a
text file (0644). And I didn't create it anywhere.

No.
