You get what you asked for, promoting a nonfree product in a free
environment will never be fun.
Can we all stop the whining now? Everyone using nonfree software should
know, that he can get screwed.
BK won't be the only (distributed) source management system forever and if
there should be any interoperability problems caused by BK, Linus has
hopefully a good filter on his inbox.
bye, Roman
