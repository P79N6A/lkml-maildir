why? iptables work quite fine on a typical linux
system when you 'delegate' certain functionality
to certain chains (i.e. doesn't require access to
_all_ of them)

well, soemtimes 'hacks' are not only simpler but also 
a much better solution for a given problem than the
straight forward approach ... 
for example, you won't have multiple routing tables
in a kernel where this feature is disabled, no?
so why should it affect a guest, or require modified
apps inside a guest when we would decide to provide
only a single routing table?

the future is already there, it's called Xen or UML, or QEMU :)

and what if they want to use virtualization inside
their guests? where do you draw the line?
