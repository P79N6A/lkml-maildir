The only way I can make sense of this is if you're trying to say that
because the user is trying to pass in a fixed address, that 0 should
then be permitted.
The intention was to disallow vmas starting at 0 categorically. i.e. it
is very intentional to deny the MREMAP_FIXED to 0 case of mremap().
It was also the intention to deny the MAP_FIXED to 0 case of mmap(),
though I didn't actually sweep that much (if at all).
