'alignment', that's the word, thanks!

Well, can always patch CodeStyle and checkpatch.pl and then see what the 
rest thinks.
Think checkpatch is fairly easy to "fix". It seems to have all the lines 
in an array so there is only a need to check the indent-depth of the 
line above and see if the current is the same with only spaces afterwards.
The idea was to reply with a patch, but it is bit late now.

Would guess more...
The reason I reacted were because checkpatch.pl complained about a:
<tab><tab>foo(int a,
<tab><tab>____int b)
with the "use tabs not spaces". There is little point in patching this 
stuff but lets not make it worse (IMHO).
