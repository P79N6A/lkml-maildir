BP6 bugs, not linux's, and especially not ide's fault.  you have to
do the usual BP6 voodoo: bios update, extra fans, big PS, higher voltage.

I don't really expect much from my BP6, but:
       -------Sequential Output-------- ---Sequential Input-- --Random--
       -Per Char- --Block--- -Rewrite-- -Per Char- --Block--- --Seeks---
    MB K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU  /sec %CPU
   500 24150 100.8 57334 63.5 26323 31.7 28861 91.4 60735 52.0 258.6  2.1
that's on a 128M machine, so the bandwidths are real.  that's a 
3-way raid0 of 15G/platter udma33 disks under test10pre5.
the astonishing thing is that when bonnie's writing, the machine 
wakes bdflush up > 50,000 times per second!  so obviously, the 
%CPU numbers are even less meaningful than usual.
good job, Andre!
