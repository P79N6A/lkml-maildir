I got this just before lunch too. I was trying out 2.4.1 + zerocopy
(with netfilter configured off, see the sendfile/zerocopy thread for
more details and hardware specs) and tried running vsftpd on the
slower machine instead of the faster machine as before. I connected
to vsftpd with an ftp client and got a
    500 OOPS: chdir
    Login failed.
    421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
(ftpd's idea of an OOPS; not the kernel's idea of an oops, of course).
That was probably because I hadn't configured the directory properly
but following that the machine hung, in the following way: userland
hung: no more logins, existent xterm processes didn't refresh their
windows on my (remote) display. The machine was still pingable, though.
I configured Magic SysRq into the kernel but hadn't played with it
before so I hadn't enabled it in /proc (D'oh. Next time I'll know.)
As in Chris' case, vzftpd was a zombie (so Foo-ScrollLock told me) and
all other processes were looking OK in R or S state.
Looking at the kernel's EIP every so often to see what was going
showed remove_wait_queue, add_wait_queue, skb_recv_datagram and
wait_for_packet mostly. Random thought: if vsftpd did a sendfile and
then exited, becoming a zombie, could there be a problem with
tearing down a sendfile mapping? I'm off to read some code.
