	Your issue has nothing to do with select or poll scalability, it has to do
with the fact that UDP is unreliable and you must provide your own send
timing. A UDP server or client cannot just send 100 messages in one shot and
expect the other end to get all of them. They probably won't all even make
it to the wire, so the recipient can't solve the problem.
