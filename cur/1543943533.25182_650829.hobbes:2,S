How many CPUs do you have ? It's impressive to see such important variations.
I would guess from the numbers that you sometimes have 1 or 2 CPUs doing
nothing. I've already observed strange CPU usage patterns while building
kernels (bound to 50% usage on a dual-athlon), but I can't say for sure
that it was only on 2.6, so it may be related to make dependencies instead
(at least it's what I've been suspecting till now).

These ones look rather strange. What type of workload is it ? Can you
publish the program for others to test it ?
