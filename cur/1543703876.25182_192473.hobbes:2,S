Hi,
the problem: no mouse in console and X modes on laptop with PS2 mouse.
Kernel generate message:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
while loading mousedev, psmouse.
Module listing is indicating that mousedev is in use.
In console no mouse at all, in X it appears but don't move.
I have problems with Debian unstable (custom build kernel or
debian one) and RedHat.
The only discussion on the web can be found here:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/131540
I just confirm it.
Could you please CC'd messages to me, I'm not on a list.
Thanks,
Valentine.
