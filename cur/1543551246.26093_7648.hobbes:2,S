This manpage shows me functions and structs.  I'm assuming you want these
used by the offending program or the shell under which the program is
being called.  In the first case, a person might not have source to the
program and if thats the case, it doesn't help much.  And in the second
case, if the shell sets it, does it affect children of a process (aka
fork()'d)?  
Thanks for yout time...
