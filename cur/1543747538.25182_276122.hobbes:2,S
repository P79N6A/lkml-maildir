I believe that both IBM and OSDL are doing this, or are getting geared up
to do this.  With both Linus bk and -mm.
However I have my doubts about how useful it will end up being.  These test
suites don't seem to pick up many regressions.  I've challenged Gerrit to
go back through a release cycle's bugfixes and work out how many of those
bugs would have been detected by the test suite.
My suspicion is that the answer will be "a very small proportion", and that
really is the bottom line.
We simply get far better coverage testing by releasing code, because of all
the wild, whacky and weird things which people do with their computers. 
Bless them.

Yes, we need humans between the tests and the developers.  Someone who has
good experience with the tests and who can say "hey, something changed
when I do X".  If nothing changed, we don't hear anything.
It's a developer role, not a testing role.   All testing is, really.
