It's a little worse than this, I think.  Propagating pte_dirty(pte) to
set_page_dirty(page) cannot be done until after the flush_tlb_cpus, if
the ptes are writable: and copy_page_range is not setting "cow", so not
write protecting, when it's a shared writable mapping.  Easy answer is
to scrap "cow" there and always do the write protection; but I doubt
that's the correct answer.  swap_out could keep an array of pointers to
ptes, to propagate dirty after flushing TLB and before freeing pages,
but that's not very pretty.
