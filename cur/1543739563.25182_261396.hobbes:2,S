Hi List!
I have some problems with my usb printer with the latest kernelversions. 
Don't know which kernelversion it started but after a while (one or more 
days) the printer connected via usb stops working and this message fills 
up /var/log/messages:
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: error -110 reading printer status
I am using a gentoo-system on an AthlonXP machine. I have tried several 
kernelversions, some with included patchset from gentoo and some vanilla 
kernels. I don't know with which version the problem started, i think 
somewhere at 2.6.8 but this is not exact. To solve the problem i can 
only reboot the machine, switching the printer off and on again is not a 
solution. Other usb-devices still work. Printing system is cups. When 
the messages appear the systemload gets up to something over 50%.
Any suggestions on this problem?
