fsync performance gives you different performance.  Better to write more 
stuff to flush the cache.

It isn't fair.  fsync is a different code path, and may be less 
efficient.  Or more, depending on the fs.  reiser4 is currently not well 
optimized for fsync, maybe next year I will change that but not this 
week....
Benchmarking well is hard.....
