Hi all,
	I'm trying to use autofs for the first time and am running into some
problems. First,  the documentation seems quite weak, that is, I'm not sure
if what I have is what I should have. I managed to find an autofs version 4
pre 9 tarball on the kernel mirrors. This seem the latest but is still a bit
old and the referenced home page doesn't seem any newer. My real problem,
however, is that when I try to build it I get this error:
lookup_program.c:147: `OPEN_MAX' undeclared (first use in this function)
My understanding is that OPEN_MAX is defined in linux/limits.h but I
hesitate to change the code since I would expect this to build out of the
box.
	Cas someone who is using autofs give me some pointers? Am I on the right
track?
Thanks,
--Rainer
