I don't think anybody has actually written such a patch yet (correct me 
if I'm wrong).  When somebody does it will certainly depend on the page 
migration patches.  As far as describing what it is, the concept is 
pretty simple.  Migrate in use pieces of memory around to make lots of 
smaller unallocated memory into fewer larger unallocated memory.
