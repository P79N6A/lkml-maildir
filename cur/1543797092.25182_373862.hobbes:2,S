Hi,
Thanks for the reply. I think my problem has something to do with this 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5165,
 however I just installed 
kernel 2.6.15_rc5 and the problem is still there, but now it seems that it 
slows down even before the init begins.
As soon as I have the time I'll look into git, since I never used it before. 
Thanks again
Marco
