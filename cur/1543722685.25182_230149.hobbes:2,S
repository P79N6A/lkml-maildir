Also this is applicable to mailboxes - automize the marking of old mails of
the mailing list as elastic, whenever the threshold is reached, you might
either want to put those mails as compressed archive or simply delete it.
This has two advantages:
 - No email bounces for the reason of 'mailbox full' and
 - Optimized utlization of the mailbox
Yes, this can be done using scripts too, but what if you are to use other
users' space that they are not using? Of course script cannot do that! You
need to have some FS support or a libquota hack.

One can either even mark the whole directory as elastic. When it comes to
taking action, I think I'II opt for random deletion of the files for not
being unfair to any particular user.
