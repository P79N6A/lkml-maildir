ok, got it:
        int scsi_dispatch_cmd(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd)
        ...
                /*
                 * If SCSI-2 or lower, store the LUN value in cmnd.
                 */
                if (cmd->device->scsi_level <= SCSI_2) {
                        cmd->cmnd[1] = (cmd->cmnd[1] & 0x1f) |
                                       (cmd->device->lun << 5 & 0xe0);
                }
hm. now what .... ? If scsi-2 requires this, and the device is scsi-2 (in fact,
cmd->device->scsi_level equals 3, which means SCSI_2) then the device is a violation
of the scsi-specs. do you have any suggestion how to fix this (beside from commenting
the source)
kind regards,
