I just built 2.1.132 on my system:
2x200MHz PPro system, kernel SMP
256MB RAM, DPT 2044 SCSI, Matrox Mill2 graphics, Gravis Ultrasound
PnP, Xig Accelerated X 4.1.2
Things that work, and didn't used to work:
* my PS/2 mouse... this was a show stopper for earlier kernels on
  my system.  Now after about and hour I've yet to see erratic mouse
  behavior.  Previously I had to run 2.1.124 (pre-key/mouse
  integration)
* The commercial OSS sound driver seems to work now, it didn't
  before.
Things that are not working, or seem odd:
* x11amp crashes with a socket bug... the message says to contact
  the author but it might be related to another thing I have
  seen
* ...which is that sometimes sockets seem... slow, for want of a
  better way to put it.  Specifically, sending mail is very slow now.
  Both mail clients and sendmail seem to use a LOT of CPU now when
  doing SMTP, whereas in the past I could not have even measured
  it for a single message.  strace shows a lot of socket calls,
  some failing
I can provide more details like strace logs and the like, but
figure I may as well see if there are more specific things I should
check first.
