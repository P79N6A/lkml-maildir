We have at least the header_install target where it makes sense
to continue with a gcc that is not for the architecture being build.
So plain gcc (aka no CROSS_COMPILE) should be the fallback
solution. This fallback is anyway what most architectures use.

cris lacks a major rehaul - planned in this merge window. Will sync it when done.
h8300 should not use CROSS_COMPILE - a bit confused here.
And the reason why $(shell ) is preferred over backticks is simple.
We almost never use backticks in the kernel Makefile since the $(shell )
syntax is more obvious and I like it this way.
