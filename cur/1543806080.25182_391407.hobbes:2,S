Hi all,
after some discussions with some people, I made available a collection of
useful patches for kernel 2.4. There are only a dozen of patches right
now, but it's very easy to add more. Amongst those patches can be found
some drivers, security enhancements, polling optimisations, gcc4 fixes,
VM optimisations, etc... Links to the original sites as well as a local
mirror are provided.
They are classified by categories and can easily be found in more than
one category. I plan to add many more patches such as ACL, squashfs,
preempt, netdev-random, patch-o-matic, etc... when I have the time, and
possibly start the same work for 2.6 (everything has been prepared in
order to make it easy too).
If there are patches you frequently use and wish to be added there,
feel free to send a link and description.
At the moment, it's hosted on my home server. If it generates too much
traffic, I'll move it somewhere else.
