I've been taking LVM patches into -ac via Joe and the impression I get
is that they are working sanely and sensibly towards cleaning up the
existing LVM code. It certainly isnt a trivial job to take any piece of
code and make it excellent, and I am sure they would benefit from productive
help and patches
