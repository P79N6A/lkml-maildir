A ton of SATA work in the past few weeks, but not a lot terribly new in 
this update.  The update is mainly to rediff against the latest 2.4 and 
2.6 kernels.  Note that this does not include experimental patches. 
Notably absent are
* lba48 (large transfer) requests
* splitting up Promise driver into sata_promise (tx2/tx4) and sata_sx4 
(sx4) drivers.
* adding better flush-cache / writeback caching support
The above are all experimental patches I have locally.
Finally, per user requests, I have started posting the associated 
changelog as well.
