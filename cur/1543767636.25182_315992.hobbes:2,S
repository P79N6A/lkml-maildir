It would be interesting to see just how important it is to hide this.

Actually, yes there is.. its a firmware partition that would normally
not be mounted, but in order to dd new firmware versions to it, I
depended on the node... which has ceased to exist.
I would like to see an easier workaround then just ignoring it like
that, but if its really needed....
Anyways, thanks everyone for the info, its much appreciated.
