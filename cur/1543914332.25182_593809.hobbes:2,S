Subject: [PATCH] State limits to safety of _safe iterators
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/12/343

The _safe list iterators make a blanket statement about how they are
safe against removal.  This patch, inspired by private conversations
with people who unwisely but perhaps understandably took this blanket
statement at its word, adds comments stating limits to this safety.
