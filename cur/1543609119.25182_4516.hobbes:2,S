If A & B are CPU hog processes and E is the editor ( low level keventd )
you do want to avoid priority inversion between A and B when E kicks in.
Really IO bound tasks accumulates dynamic priority inside the recalc loop
and this is sufficent to win over this kind of "advantage" given to CPU
hog tasks.
My approach make also more "expensive" the preemption goodness to move
tasks between CPUs.
I'll take a closer look at your patch anyway.

sched_jtime = last schedule time in jiffies
cpu_jtime   = wall time after which the task will have 0 dynamic priority increase

It's missing of the published patch.
The one that i'm testing has that + a lower dynamic priority increase :
weight += (p->cpu_jtime - jiffies) >> 1;
I'm just testing results about this.
