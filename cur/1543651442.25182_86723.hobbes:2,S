No. IMHO it is impossible to use a software debugger to catch 2uS
deskew delays or errors in DMA engines. That's what logic analyzers
are for. If you attach or fire up the debugger, the timing changes and
you're no longer testing the failure case but something different.
>(No Linus, I'm not pushing them, just stating my opinion.)
I am, BTW completely your opinion. Personally I find it horrid that
"the XIAFS resurrection" is winked through with "will be probably
accepted for the hack value" and LKCD is rejected with "bloat"
arguments.
But hey, it _is_ Linus' kernel and he may choose as he likes. I
e.g. run vendor kernels (for 2.4).
