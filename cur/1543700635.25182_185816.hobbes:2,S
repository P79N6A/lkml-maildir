Well, from the linux-activists messages for that period would be in:
  
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/ftp-archives/tsx-11.mit.edu/Oct-07-1996/mail-archive/linux-activists/Volume2/Linux-V2-5XX.tar.z
Specifically, the files "digest51[789] digest52[012]" are the neighborhood
around july 25th.  I did a quick grep for "errno" and a few strings from
the errno.h file and didn't see anything relevant pop up, though.
