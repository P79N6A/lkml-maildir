That I wonder about. The power management stuff and some other things
that matter for timing are different however.

Its just a guess but if you have low latency stuff, you have pre-empt
enabled and you actually depend upon the semantics of inb_p/outb_p
giving delays reliably then I'm not convinced are guarantees are strong
enough
Specifically we don't have any pre-empt protection between the I/O delay
and the I/O so we could violate it as we don't have pre-empt disables in
inb_p/outb_p and if your CPU context switch is quick enough it could
trigger a problem.
