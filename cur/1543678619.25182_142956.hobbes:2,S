Afternoon kernel-gurus :)
Every 2.5 kernel since 2.5.70-mm9 that I have tried to use has failed to
work properly.  
The primary issue is as mentioned elsewhere that the synaptics touchpad
simply doesn't work when psmouse is loaded.  The psmouse_noext option
results in behaviour worse than the old default where no tap-to-click
works at all.  
However, there are other issues with the new ps/2 code, the keyboard
appears to get interrupt stormed at sometimes (or something) and I find
that letters either appear repeated (once for each keystroke after the
offending letter) or the keyboard response rate drops so low that I have
to type like a hunt-and-pecker in order to ensure that all of my
characters are captured.
I am up for any troubleshooting projects you wish to send me on, but I
don't know enough about kernel drivers to hunt down these issues in the
ps/2 code myself.
Thanks much for any help,
Brandon Low
