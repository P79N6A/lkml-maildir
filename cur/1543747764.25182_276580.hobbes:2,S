LTP-20041203
- Change to fix file creation error on certain filesystems.
- gf15 and gf18 failed on both 32-bits and 64-bits,
  Growfile used lseek and fstat to operate file. When file grows
  beyond 4G,lseek and fstat would fail on 32-bits machine.
- Added fs-bench by Hironobu SUZUKI and additional JFFS
  testscript by G.BANU PRAKASH.
- Added mongo filesystem test by namesys and additional testscript from
G.BANU PRAKASH.
- Applied patch from Jacky Malcles to allow test to run on IA64.
- settimeofday01 fails on some platforms(ia64,41611   x86-64) occasionally.
  The testcase did not consider the situation when
CONFIG_TIME_INTERPOLATION is enabled.
- Remove case from password query since the distros use both upper and
lower case P/p.
