Hmmm... I use this driver on an almost-daily basis (it's hooked up to an
ISDN "modem" at 230.4Kbps since my cable modem service is often down) and
it seems to work perfectly for me. Some of its behavior was a bit odd
several releases back (2.4.11 or so??) but it's been stable for me for a
while now (probably since 2.4.14, if I had to guess).
The only suggestion I can think of is to make sure you're setting the
port's speed properly in whatever program you're using for the testing
(personally, I find minicom useful for this kind of stuff).
