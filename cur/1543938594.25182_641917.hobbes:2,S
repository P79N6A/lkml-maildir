Oh ... never say never.  One of the things the shift we did in SCSI to
the block submission api and elimination of the single map path actually
enables you to send kernel vmalloc areas straight into the storage APIs
(which was previously absolutely forbidden) ... fortunately no-one has
yet.
However, I think you're right we could do with a check in the PIO path
to make sure each sector is physically contiguous ... unfortunately, an
easy alignment check would trip on the IDENTIFY and other kernel
commands, sigh.
