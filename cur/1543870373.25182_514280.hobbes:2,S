The handler for smp_call_function() is called with local interrupts
disabled (from the IPI handler).
So to provide a consistent call environment for that handler, on_each_cpu()
will also disable local interrupts when making the direct call on this CPU.
Similarly the !CONFIG_SMP version of on_each_cpu() disables local
interrupts when running the caller's function.
