I'm getting an unresolved in soundcore.o that is preventing me from 
having sound.
/lib/modules/2.4.21-rc1/kernel/sound/soundcore.o: unresolved symbol 
devfs_remove
/lib/modules/2.4.21-rc1/kernel/sound/soundcore.o: insmod 
/lib/modules/2.4.21-rc1/kernel/sound/soundcore.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.21-rc1/kernel/sound/soundcore.o: insmod snd-card-0 failed
Can that be fixed?
Also I have problems if I compile USB Audio and USB MIDI from the USB 
section AND USB Audio and USB MIDI from the ALSA section. Compilation 
fails in that situation. Might want to put the former patch up if this 
stuff might take a while to fix.
Thanks,
David
