Disabling preemption is a possible solution if the critical section is short
- less than 100us - otherwise preemption latencies become a problem.
The implementation of synchronize_kernel() that Rusty and I discussed
earlier in this thread would work in other cases, such as module
unloading, where there was a concern that it was not practical to have
any sort of lock in the read-side code path and the write side was not
time critical.
