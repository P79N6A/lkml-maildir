Subject: [PATCH 2.6.24-rc1] fix sg_phys to use dma_addr_t
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/641

x86_32 CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G with 5GB RAM hung when booting, after issuing
some "request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000" messages in
trying to exec /sbin/init.
The binprm buf doesn't see the right ".ELF" header because sg_phys()
is providing the wrong physical addresses for high pages: a 32-bit
unsigned long is too small in this case, we need to use dma_addr_t.

Whether this is a complete patch, suitable for all architectures,
I'm not sure: it builds, boots and runs correctly on the x86_32 box
in question, but you'll be a lot wiser than me about using dma_addr_t
for everyone.  (Seems a bit of a shame to include <asm/types.h> here,
when I think all arches already get to include it one way or another,
typically via asm/scatterlist.h; but I guess it's safest to repeat it.)
