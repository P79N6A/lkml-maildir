Thank you very much for your response Clemens.
I tried strace on a regular system. It does not show which tty, etc., as it uses the stdout (fd = 1) and write(1, ...) to it.
This is not a student project. I am trying to build my own kernel and ramdisk. Kernel boots fine to a point where it starts accessing ramdisk and executes init scripts. From there on nothing gets printed. I did some debugging and found that prints of user land programs are not coming to the serial console, while kernel prints are working fine. I found all the programs getting executed, by placing a printk in execve routine and printing the arguments.
So, I wanted to trace down the path from user program to the kernel and see why it is not printing messages from user program. I placed a printk in drivers/char/tty_io.c:tty_write() and it is not getting called from my file system. I tried the same thing on my good system (say regular PC) and it works as expected.
Any clues that can help debug this issue is highly appreciated.
How can I get access to the same printf string inside kernel.
Thanks
Siva

Come on, are we playing hide and seek here?
You can use strace to follow a typical hello world example and
see what device it opens to feed the hello out.
I.e. it can be to the current /dev/ttyX and not to /dev/console
or if you are logged in via SSH to a machine, the device
is again different... or if you use screen, ...
Work your way from there and then use a Linux Source code
Cross Reference (lxr, ask Google for one) and follow the code.
