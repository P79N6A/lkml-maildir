I know but only as server. What I am more interested in would be
a sort of mount point where I can mount the zope webdav export
and copy files there etc. as I would do normally.
A linux webdav filesystem would also have the advantage that one
would not have to incorporate webdav support into every application
(I am speaking of clients here not servers). Thus the only solution
which makes sense (IMHO) to do add webdav support to the kernel.

Well these are different things to a) build a whole application server
into the kernel and b) to add a new filesystem to it.
best,
