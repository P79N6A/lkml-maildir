The above, and worse, will be used. Face reality.
Now, what problem were you trying to solve?
The data all ends up as binary data types anyway,
so you're not escaping any limitations. You're
just hiding them, and letting stuff break when
the limitations get hit.

I'm telling you that this isn't your ideal world.
Stupid parsers are damn common.
BTW, many text data formats don't deserve anything
better anyway, because the format itself is ill-defined.
Prime example: /proc/cpuinfo

Yeah, they could do that. Many will not. Reality again...
Using ASCII is just asking for bugs. It's begging and
pleading for bugs, especially when you really do have to
fit this variable-size data into a fixed-size space.

Ah, but it has to get into memory at some point.
There it will need a data type. Changing the data
type involves changing the parser and inventing
yet another in-memory struct anyway.

I was being kind. I could have mentioned LISP or Scheme.
Oddly, you volunteered them already yourself!
Fine, no operator overloading:
err = ascii_math_make_number(baz, 512); // baz = 512
if(err){
  // handle error here
}
err = ascii_math_add(foo, bar, baz); // foo = bar + baz
if(err){
  // handle error here
}
// ...
// blah, blah
// ...
err = ascii_math_free(baz); // don't forget to free memory
if(err){
  // handle error here
}

With a 32-bit binary field, programs will use 32-bit types.
With a 64-bit binary field, programs will use 64-bit types.
With an ASCII format, every program will use a different type.

It does, a bit, but it sure beats hidden per-program
limits caused by every program converting the ASCII
to a different in-memory structure.

That only solves a superficial problem. It doesn't let
you reliably handle changing data types and keywords.

I'm hoping he'll realize the similarity and back away in horror.
