	So, you'd like a new flag name?  That can be done.

	The point of dlmfs is not to express every primitive that the
DLM has.  dlmfs cannot express the CR, CW, and PW levels of the VMS
locking scheme.  Nor should it.  The point isn't to use a filesystem
interface for programs that need all the flexibility and power of the
VMS DLM.  The point is a simple system that programs needing the basic
operations can use.  Even shell scripts.
