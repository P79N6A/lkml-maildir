 I don't find it necessary, but if you have so much interest, you have my
 blessing.
 Though I would instead put the #ifdef's in "linux/firmware.h" providing
 dummy inlines. Having to load a useless firmware_class.o seams a little
 overkill, and that way you also make it possible to compile
 request_firmware dependent code without CONFIG_FW_LOADER.
 Oh, and feel free to do the same for the 2.6 series :-)
 Have a nice day
