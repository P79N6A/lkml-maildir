Linus, backing store is irrelevant here (and BTW, variables are no better
or worse than arguments / structure fields / return values / argument of
sizeof / etc.)
a) integer type equivalent to particular enum is up to compiler; anything
that depends on it is at the very least non-portable.
b) __bitwise doesn't break anything; __le32 enum members are just as OK as
int ones.
c) its enum members where we are not doing what gcc does; enum itself is
trivial to deal with.  So that's where the warnings should be.
Anyway, I'll send you sparse patches tomorrow when I rediff that stuff to
your current tree...
