  That's pity :-(. So i don't help you with this because i don't have
similar IBM notebook. Hmmm you should beat out datasheet from IBM :-).

  Yes, external pcmcia_cs drivers works in this situation. But you need
working irq for e.g. cardbus card that have only pci driver in kernel. I
needed this because realtek_cb work bad and i would like to use cardbus
usb controller and some wifi card.
