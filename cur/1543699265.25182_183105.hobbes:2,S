Heh.  Actually, 99% of initramfs support is there - the only piece missing
is unpack_to_rootfs().  IOW, rootfs is there in the same way as on 2.6,
but it isn't pre-populated.  By now it's too late, but a couple of months
ago it would be a trivial enough for backport - init/initramfs.c is
self-contained and it would be a matter of copying several kilobytes of
stuff in 2.4 + adding a section to ld script (same on all architectures)
+ adding one line in init/main.c.  It's nowhere near as intrusive as other
changes on the list (including dm), but it *is* too late for any of that
stuff in 2.4.
