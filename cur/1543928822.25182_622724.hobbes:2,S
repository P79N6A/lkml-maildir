Hi,
I've got an old 2xP-II @ 400MHz Compaq AP400 system, which I'm still 
using. It has many peculiarities, so, I wouldn't be surprised if the 
answer to my questions would be "sorry, the patient is rather dead than 
alive".
Some of the problems lie in ACPI area, I tried some time ago to fix the 
ACPI tables for these machine, but never got enough time for that. So I'm 
still booting with acpi=noirq
Another problem is its battery is dead and it's hard soldered to the 
mainboard (Compaq)...
It might also have some problems with one of its 3 SCSI busses.
I compiled a .24-ish kernel for it with CONFIG_NO_HZ and 
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS. To get the system boot at least sometimes I have 
to specify nohz=off. Then I get
* Found PM-Timer Bug on the chipset. Due to workarounds for a bug,
* this clock source is slow. Consider trying other clock sources
Without this parameter it hangs usually between
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
and
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 1
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 0
Tried booting with clocksource=tsc then I've got
Marking TSC unstable due to: possible TSC halt in C2.
And then a few of these:

 =======================
so, is there any way I can still reasonably use this system? Which 
configuration / command-line parameters should I try?
If needed can provide complete dmesg (with nohz=off or with 
clocksource=tsc) and .config.
Thanks
Guennadi
