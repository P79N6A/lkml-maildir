Was a decision re: GUIDs make WRT Linux?  Seems (at least on the surface) to
be an interesting idea.  The major obstacle I see here is ensuring a GUID is
truly globally unique.  Given the fact that many USB peripherals don't
follow the spec to the letter and therefore don't include serial numbers in
their identifiers, this may not be possible.  I wonder how Windows deals
with this.

FWIW, this is standard Macintosh behaviour (at least on the ADB it was; I
don't know how USB-based mice on the Mac behave) as well.
