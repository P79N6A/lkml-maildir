I see many anonymous unions used in drivers/scsi/ipr.h:
drivers/scsi/ipr.h:460: warning: unnamed struct/union that defines no instances
drivers/scsi/ipr.h:620: warning: unnamed struct/union that defines no instances
drivers/scsi/ipr.h:665: warning: unnamed struct/union that defines no instances
drivers/scsi/ipr.h:788: warning: unnamed struct/union that defines no instances
drivers/scsi/ipr.h:942: warning: unnamed struct/union that defines no instances
that my Debian stable (gcc 2.95.4) does not understand. Changes still says:
o  Gnu C                  2.95.3
