Hi Nick,
Yes, the read tests do currently run primarily out of cache. This does 
have some value for measuring the relative overhead of the i/o apis. To 
avoid cache effects, and measure the real throughput, we need to bump 
the size up and, as you suggest, size*2 is a good value to use. We've 
tried to keep the overall test suite time down by maintaining shorter 
runs whereever possible. So rather than increasing to run size by 2, we 
will reduce the memory used, at boot, then use runs of newsmallsize*2. 
This will keep the runs from taking too long and also avoid the cache 
benefits. We will have to tweak this to come up with the appropriate 
balance of memsize vs run time. This should be available in a few days.
Thanks for the feedback.
Mark
