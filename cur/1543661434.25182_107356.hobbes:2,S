| Your processes will show strange start times, CPU times etc.

|
| However, this is a bit cosmetic. There is a much more serious problem:
|
| 		Jiffy Wrap Bugs
|
| There were reports of machines hanging on jiffy wrap.
| This is typically a result of incorrect jiffy use in some driver.
| Ask Tim - he is hunting those problems regularly, but he is outnumbered
| by buggy driver authors. :(
|
| There is a better solution to ensure correct jiffy wrap handling in
| *ALL* kernel code: make jiffy wrap in first five minutes of uptime.
| Tim has a patch for such config option. This is almost right.
| This MUST NOT be a config option, it MUST be mandatory in every
| kernel. Driver writers would be bitten by their own bugs and will
| fix it themself. Tim, what do you think?
I like it too.  We should take advantage of easy-to-force/find/fix
problems like this.
