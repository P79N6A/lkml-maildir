Subject: [patch 2.6.13-rc2] pci: restore BAR values in pci_set_power_state for D3hot->D0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some PCI devices lose all configuration (including BARs) when
transitioning from D3hot->D0.  This leaves such a device in an
inaccessible state.  The patch below causes the BARs to be restored
when enabling such a device, so that its driver will be able to
access it.

Some firmware leaves devices in D3hot after a (re)boot.  Most drivers
call pci_enable_device very early, so devices left in D3hot that lose
configuration during the D3hot->D0 transition will be inaccessible to
their drivers.
Drivers could be modified to account for this, but it would
be difficult to know which drivers need modification.  This is
especially true since often many devices are covered by the same
driver.  It likely would be necessary to replicate code across dozens
of drivers.
The patch below should trigger only when transitioning from D3hot->D0
(or at boot), and only for devices that have the "no soft reset" bit
cleared in the PM control register.  I believe it is safe to include as
part of the PCI infrastructure.
