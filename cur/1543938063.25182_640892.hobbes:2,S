See the rationale in the patch -- any iBCS application will need a significant
kernel patch. If people add this kernel patch they can easily patch the three
more places that detect the executables.
But it does not make sense for all Linux kernels to always check for iBCS executables
when they don't have to code to run them anyways.
Now if iBCS support is truly as important as you claim I'm sure
someone will eventually submit a patch for mainline to support it properly.
If yes the hooks can be readded in a clean way, not in a hackish way
like they currently exists.
