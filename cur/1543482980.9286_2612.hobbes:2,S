   This is exactly the reason why do we have dev->base_address[] and the
drivers use it instead of reading the addresses from the configuration space.
dev->base_address[] should contain addresses suitable as an argument to
ioremap() [after stripping off the region type in lower bits] and as a
file offset in /dev/mem.

   Yes, this is the right way to go.
				Have a nice fortnight
