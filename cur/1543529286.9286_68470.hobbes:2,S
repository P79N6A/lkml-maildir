dev->set_mac_address is _your_ private routine with status equal to
this ioctl.
Ask yourself: why standard ethernet routine (which is just sample,
your driver may have one which you desire) prohibits to change its address,
when it is UP?
There are two answers:
1. Because hardware may be confused, when reinitializing card in flight.
   It does not apply to your case.
2. Because another software (f.e. ARP) will be confused as well.
   It applies to your case and, moreover, doing such ioctl privately,
   you bypass even those modest checks, which could be made by core.
Please, repair this yet to use standard SIOCSIFHWADDR.
Also, think about multicast filters. Now this driver is functional
only for IP without multicasts, despite of the adverticements. 8)
