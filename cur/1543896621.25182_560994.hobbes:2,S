I think we probably want some numbers, at least for tasklets used in
potentially performance critical code.

I don't like this wrapping at all.  What you're doing is a tradeoff to
do less work today in exchange for more maintaince overhead and more crufty
code in the future.  So while I sympathize a lot with trying to get rid
of tasklets I'd rather prefer to convert individual drivers over until
all users are gone.  It's not exactly a very complicated conversion either.

And this is something that might be fine for benchmarking, but not something
we should put in.  Keeping two wildly different implementation of core
functionality with very different behaviour around is quite bad.  Better
kill tasklets once for all.
