If the cleanup is just to move it from drivers/block to init/ and give it a new
name or put its contents inside main.c, I think it won't affect any driver at
all, and thus is even less harmless and riskless than the recent bulk move of
media drivers.
If there is enough agreement as to where to put it (init/init.c as someone in
IRC suggested? Move it inside init/main.c? Move it to init/genhd.c?), I'll make
a patch.
