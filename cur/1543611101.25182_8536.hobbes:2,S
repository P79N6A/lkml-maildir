It appears that all IDE is controlled with /proc/ide/ide0/hda/settings

No, that fix went in separately.  Roger Larsson created it, then
I hit the same problem and forwarded Roger's patch to the relevant
parties.

Well, `grep -r max_readahead drivers/scsi' comes up blank,
so it looks like the scsi drivers don't implement the
driver-specific readhead tunable, and so they will fall back
to the /proc/sys/vm/max_readahead global.  I guess.

The generic filesystem library code.  The bit which sits
on top of the block layer and gets its block mappings from the
filesystem and does generic_file_readahead().  Variously
referred to as VFS or VM.  It's neither, and both, really.
