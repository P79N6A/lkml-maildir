Hi,
Please note that the current LDM driver in the kernel only supports "basic 
volumes/partitions".
None of the RAID (i.e. spanning, mirroring, striping) features are 
supported and supporting them is AFAIC not possible without a major 
programming effort at the present time which would involve changing some 
kernel core code, and such things are better left for 2.5.x...
Best regards,
         Anton
