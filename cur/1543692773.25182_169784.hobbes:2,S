Well, the P2B-S is in blacklist.c in 2.4.22.
What does the entry in blacklist.c mean? Does this entry mean acpi=ht is 
forced like the entry for the P2B-DS in dmi_scan.c?
Is this a hardwired problem on the Motherboard? Or might this be fixed 
with the latest BIOS?
I'd like to try ACPI on my P2B-DS anyway. I think there was an append 
line to disable ACPI IRQ Routing - was it acpi=pci?
