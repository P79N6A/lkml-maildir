this is not a good argument.
the situation above is real, and a new poll mechanism should handle it.
(the kevent paper has a nice section about this problem)
why put the burden on the application, if the kernel already has
all information needed?
every api should be build to cause the least astonishment to its users.
epoll is much more scalable than standard poll, yet i don't think
it's a nice api.
you should at least build it in a way that it can be extended later.
it would be sad if one had to add another syscall to build an
better notification mechanism later.
the unified event mechanism introduced in bsd is a good example imho.
we should build something that is similar useful for applications.
don't take me wrong, i greatly appreciate the work put in epoll,
i just think it's far from being perfect at the moment.
