Thanks, I get it.

+#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS
+static inline int pci_domain_nr(struct pci_bus *bus)
+{
+	struct pci_sysdata *sd = bus->sysdata;
+	return sd->domain;
+}
+
+static inline int pci_proc_domain(struct pci_bus *bus)
+{
+	return pci_domain_nr(bus);
+}
+#endif /* CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS */
So if CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS=y, proc_proc_domain() decides to print the domain nr
in /proc iff the domain nr != 0 ?  so that the /proc file format is
different depending on the domain nr (0 vs. !0) ?
I suppose that is similar to what arch/powerpc/kernel/pci_64.c does
with hose->buid.  I think that I had rather see the domain nr printed
whenever CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS=y... oh well.
