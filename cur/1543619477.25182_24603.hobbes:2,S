I've posted this before -- my cache-optimized skip list solves the
problem of balanced-tree cache footprint.  It uses cacheline-sized
nodes and per-node locking to avoid false-sharing and increase 
concurrency.  The memory usage for the skip list is also less than
the red-black tree for trees larger than several hundred nodes.
I posted a graph on space consumption (using the Linux vm_area_struct to 
calculate space overhead) at:

There are also results for concurrency and performance as a function 
of node size.
