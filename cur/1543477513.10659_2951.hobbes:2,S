| Both /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs and /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfsfs are wrong for

I made this change.  Now I'm using your versions of the script.
However, now I'm getting a new problem:
    kernel: lockd: server <mail_server_ip> not responding, still trying
This is being triggered by `mh' when I try to read my mail.  I'm not

    nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value ...
It may have been fixed by the new rc.* scripts (we'll see ;).
            Thanks,
                -Fred
