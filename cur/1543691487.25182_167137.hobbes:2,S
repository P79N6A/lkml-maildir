I am getting different errors with database: ( I don't see these with my
"dd" tests)
	(1) sometimes open fails with EFAULT 
	(2) sometimes read/write fails with EFAULT
I have been running on "raw" for quite a while, i haven't seen this before.
I moved my logdevice to filesystem files, everything is fine.
