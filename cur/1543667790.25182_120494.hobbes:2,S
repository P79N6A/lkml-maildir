# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1001  -> 1.1002 
#	drivers/pnp/manager.c	1.5     -> 1.6    
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/03/25	ambx1@neo.rr.com	1.1002
# Silently Ignore if the device is already active/disabled
# 
# Some drivers will try to activate a device even though it is already
# active.  Instead of returning an error, the resource manager will now
# just ignore this.  This should solve some of the recently seen problems.
# Also it doesn't make sense to return an error if the device is already
# in the correct state.
# --------------------------------------------
