I'm ignoring the bait.

Ignoring this as well.

And ignoring this too.

I merely don't like seeing another dependency added when there's no  
logical reason to do it, other than "why not". And there have been  
reasons given for the "not". Your reply, seems merely to be, "Because."

I have done so. And I restate, without these patches, Perl is required  
*for any install*. Your logic seems to be, if Perl is required for any  
part of doing something with the Linux kernel, then there is no reason  
it should not be allowed in all parts.
With this logic, soon the Linux kernel will require so many  
dependencies, that even a minimal system to rebuild itself under  
itself will comprise 200MB for stripped binaries. Right now, it's down  
to about 20ish.
With that, you also require more expertise in maintaing these variety  
of tools. You have given no logical reason on why we need to add more  
complexity to the kernel, when previous tools have managed to deal  
with this task for over ten years without requiring Perl.

Yet again, you have a habit of writing off a large segment of the  
embedded development population that you seem to think doesn't exist.

Last I checked, patch was a part of busybox. Or is that yet another  
realm of embedded development that you are casting off into the depths  
of nowhere?
Honestly, it seems you have a personal vendetta against those not  
wanting to add another dependency.
