It's possible, but I have issues with play_dead():
- it is arch specific, so we need to modify i386, x86_64, and ia64 (when
we have an ia64 kvm port)
- there is no hook available here to call modules like the hotplug notifier
I estimate that that take_cpu_down will run for about a millisecond if
there are a few hundred vcpus which have last run on the dying cpu (and
that's an extreme case, which is not expected in normal operation).  If
that's too much, it can be reduced as follows:
- add a per-cpu list of vcpus that have last run on a cpu, maintained at
runtime
- on CPU_DOWN_PREPARE, walk the list and vmclear any vcpus that last ran
on the dying cpu
- on CPU_DYING (take_cpu_down), walk the list again an vmclear any vcpus
that managed to get scheduled to the dying vcpu again.  the list should
not have more than 1-2 entries in normal operation.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
