That's still "trying to get them" rather than "I could"...

And the number exponentially increases (2.6.x+1.y, 2.6.x+2.y, all at the same 
time...)
No, I pestered them a while back about possibly doing a 2.6.x.y+1 to flush 
their patch queue before doing a 2.6.x+1.1, and they seem more receptive to 
the idea now.  But then backporting 2.6.x+1.y to 2.6.x becomes your job...
