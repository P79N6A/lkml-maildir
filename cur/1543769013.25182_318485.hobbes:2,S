It looks like I missed my window of opportunity and the SMP balancing design 
has been restructured in latest -mm again so this patch will have to wait 
another generation. Carlos, Markus you'll have to wait till that code settles 
down (if ever) before I (or someone else) rewrites it for it to get included 
in -mm followed by mainline. The patch you currently have will work fine for 
2.6.11* and 2.6.12*
Cheers,
Con
