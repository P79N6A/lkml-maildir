I agree that the thundering herd problem needs to be resolved.
Implementing wake-one for select() might be a good idea, although I
prefer the approach of using a POSIX.4 signal which gives the fd to
the signal handler/waiter. It's more scalable, so it's what should be
used for best performance. Still, that's not to say it isn't worth
optimising select() and poll() for "legacy" code. When 2.3 comes out,
I'll redo my select()/poll() optimisation patch (factor 3x speedup),
which will also help.
However, just now I'm interested in seeing what effect my scheduler
optimisation patch has. This seems like a good test environment, so
I'm curious to see the result.
But you're welcome to care more about improving select() :-)
