Yes, looks like KMail has eaten it. Hey KDE guys, is this intentional or was 
this my fault?
You can get it from

This is for simulating hotplug events. I don't know how there could be a slot 
where you put in a device that has not been there on system bootup. Ok, you 
can trigger such a case by disabling a slot, rmmod dummyphp, modprobe 
dummyphp again. Greg didn't like dummyphp to display all logical slots even 
if there is no device in them - which I can understand, under normal 
circumstances you will never have a use for this extra slots. If you want 
them just do "modprobe dummyphp showunused=1" and you'll get them all.
Normally you will just remove and bring back one or two cards in the system 
(e.g. your NIC or sound card, depending on xmms or irc being on top of your 
priority list *g*). So from my point of view it's a good idea to keep the 
slot dirs on remove so you can just go back in your command history and 
replace 0 with 1 to get the device back. I don't see why bus structure or 
whatever may ever change so rescanning the whole bus is IMHO a bit overkill.
Adding a rescan file is also extra work, the power file is there 
automagically ;)
