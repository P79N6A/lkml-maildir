Found the problem.
After disabling CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE, the system works fast again.
With pre6 or earlier versions, system works fine though even with
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE enabled.
System is IBM X22 800MHz notebook, 640MB ram.
Thanks,
Jeff

1) keyboard rate is a bit slow on 2.4.18-pre7 compared to 2.4.18-pre6.
2) On vmware 3.0, ping localhost is very slow. 2.4.18-pre6 has not such
problem.
Thanks,
Jeff
