 I have this forcedeth MAC address reversal problem when suspending
on 2 distinct boxes.  I can confirm Steinbrink's patch fixes the
problem on only one of them:
00:0a.0 Bridge: nVidia Corporation CK804 Ethernet Controller (rev f3)
 On the other one the problem persists:
00:14.0 Bridge: nVidia Corporation MCP51 Ethernet Controller (rev a1)
Thanks,
Adolfo
