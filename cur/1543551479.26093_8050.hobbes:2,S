But you can fixup all pci_dev's so bus 0 takes 0x00000-0x0fffff, bus 1 takes
0x10000-0x1ffff, and so on. ioportremap() finds out the bus by looking at the
region.
I/O space is not limited to 64 kB on non-ia32, we can use the full size of an
unsigned long.
Legacy I/O mappings (`I have legacy lp0 on bus 0 and legacy lp1 on bus 1') can
be sorted out in ioportremap() as well.
