I'm running the 2.6.22.6 kernel with the berry_charge module loaded.  I connect my 8700c via USB, but the blackberry does not appear to charge. The power icon does not change, and even after staying connected for an extended period, the device does not appear to be gaining any power.  The cable is good, as I can plug it into my Windows machine and it begins charging immediately.  I see the following in dmesg:
[ 6638.606493] usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
[ 6638.776524] usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
[ 6639.639611] usbcore: registered new interface driver berry_charge
[ 6639.837097] usb 1-2: Second magic command failed: -71.
[ 6639.866430] usb 1-2: USB disconnect, address 2
[ 6640.610385] usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
[ 6640.775947] usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
I'd be glad to provide more information if needed.
