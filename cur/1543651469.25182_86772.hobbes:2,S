Inspired by this and because Alan of course cannot be wrong about
something as simple as this I went on and implemented it.  Just to jind
that it's not working properly.  Try this:
$ echo -e "#! /bin/sh\necho u1" > u1
$ chmod +x u1
$ echo -e "#! /bin/sh\necho u2" > u2
$ chmod +x u2
$ cat u.c
int
main()
{
  system ("cp -f u1 uu");
  int fd = open ("./uu", 0);
  char buf[100];
  sprintf (buf, "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
  char buf2[100];
  int n = readlink (buf, buf2, sizeof (buf2));
  buf2[n] = '\0';
  system ("cp -f u2 uu");
  execl (buf, buf2, "hallo", 0);
  return 0;
}
$ gcc -c o u u.c
$ ./u
You should see 'u2' as the result.  But this is exactly what the fexecve
call is supposed to prevent.  The file, once opened, should be reused.
The expected result is 'u1'.
The problem is, as you can see from the readlink call in strace's
output, that /proc/self/fd/XXX is used as a symlink in the execve call.
 The symlink of course refers to 'u2'.
And thinking back, I did try to write fexecve like this back when...
Anyway, any solution to this is welcome since the missing fexecve is
regularly asked for.
