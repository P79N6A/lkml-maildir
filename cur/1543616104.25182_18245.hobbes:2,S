Just to throw in my EUR 0.02:
We're using 2.4.17-rc2aa2 on a quite huge database server. This is the most
stable and performant kernel IMHO since we tested the new 2.4.>10 series. 
The machine has 4 GB main memory, the DB process mallocs about 3 GB memory
spawning about 150 threads. "Older" kernels had the problem that short after
logging in the machine starts heavily swapping leaving the system unusable
for minutes.
2.4.17-rc2aa2 does not have this problem (since now) - even under DB loads >
15 the system is still responsive.
Good Work!
