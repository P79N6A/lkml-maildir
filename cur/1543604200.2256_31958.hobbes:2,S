I've noticed good improvements on 2.4.10-ac10, too.  You may want to try
Rik's eatcache patch available at
http://www.surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.10-ac9-eatcache
 - It does a
noticeable job of preventing the cache thrashing that occurs during
heavy cache activity.  This will result in less VM activity, hopefully,
and thus less lock held time.  He can use the feedback to tune it
better.
Also, you will really want to run lmbench on 2.4.10-ac10-nopreempt
yourself.  While a lot of lmbench is pretty kernel-specific
machine-agnostic, a faster MHz CPU will certainly change almost every
result.
