Hmm. I've heard that Unix also existed as well long before Linux was
implemented...

Linux HAS SVR4's IPC. What it does not have is POSIX's IPC. And what you want

in chroot'ed environment AFAIK. And YOU want still more such problems ??

Ok. What's alternative ? BTW I can not do this (and it was Linus's idea, not
