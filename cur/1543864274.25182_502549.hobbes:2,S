If you get rid of the bass ackwards setup_msi_msg operation they do,
so you can support at least one write_msi_msg call.

Most of the uses are within msi.c as the code is currently structured
which means you can't use it that way.

That is where we are today.  Find a way to remove the code that uses it
and it can go away.

My approach can solve your problems with a few tweaks just like Michaels
approach would have needed to solve mine.

1) Because every one tells me it is the greatest thing since sliced bread,
   and when I look it simply doesn't work, and my feeling would be it would
   be a complete retesting effort of all currently supported architectures
   to make Michaels code work.
2) Because it was scrap and replace, which is a horrible way to deal with
   a problem when we have 3 architectures working already.
Honestly I think Michael and I can get along but all of the cheer leaders seem
to be exacerbating the situation.
I do agree Michael's approach isn't that different than mine and I think we
can converge on a single implementation.  To a large extent that is what
my patchset is about.  Moving the current code far enough it is usable,
and a reasonable basis for more work.
I don't write the current code but since I touched it and started cleaning
it up I seem to be stuck with it.  So I will be happy to take care of it
until we get a version that all architectures can use.
