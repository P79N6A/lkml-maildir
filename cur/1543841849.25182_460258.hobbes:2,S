I don't know if this is a real question. Have we VIA products on PCI
card, running on not VIA chip sets ? 
but in this cases, we can add other "if" to exclude this cases from
quirks. Until then I think it is urgent put this VIA PIC quirks back to
state of kernel 2.6.12, with quirking just on PIC mode .
