Andi, it is simple. There are 3 machines on one net with the same IP Address.
Two of them run a web server and one of them a packet redirector. The packet
redirector will ARP for the address. Receive the packet from the Border router
and put it back on the wire destinated to one of the both other systems. The
other systems will receive it and process it with the OS stack, respond back
to the server. That way the load balancer only needs to pass 2-3 packets for
each http request in usermode to the load balanced servers.

              struct net_device *dev, u32 src_ip, 
              unsigned char *dest_hw, unsigned char *src_hw,
              unsigned char *target_hw)

        struct sk_buff *skb;

        if (dev->flags&IFF_NOARP)
                return;
and

        if (in_dev == NULL ||
