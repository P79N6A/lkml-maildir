I have made a fairly substantial SCHED_IDLE patch, but due to
the (never resolved) deadlock issues I haven't submitted it.
OTOH, if we make SCHED_IDLE a sysctl tunable thing, we should
be able to just ship it with the standard kernel and provide
a Big Fat Warning(tm) along with it...
If there's demand, I'll create a patch RSN.
