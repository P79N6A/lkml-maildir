I'd say it is enough to know it is an average, you don't need to specify HOW
it is averaged.
But there is a real need to export both instantaneous and averaged values in
power supplies/power sources, so we should have a standard way to do so in
hwmon, and power_supply class should use it (or the opposite, it doesn't
matter, as long as everyone does it the same way).

Agreed.
