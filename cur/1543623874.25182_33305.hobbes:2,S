This is a great example Dave, and is exactly the kind of feedback that 
free SCM tool developers need.  This is my current list of features CVS 
doesn't have which are important for kernel developers (or me).
1.    Storage of select inode metadata (i.e. link, pipe, dir, owner, ...)
2.    Ability to rename files
3.    Atomic patch set tagging (i.e. global tag patched files)
4.    Advanced merge conflict tool (i.e. tkdiff/gvimdiff like features)
5.    Remote branch repository support
6.    Multi-branch merging and tracking (i.e. merge once)
The first three have been on my personal hit list for a while.  A good 
implementation of 5 & 6 are probably the toughest to do properly, but 
also seem like key elements for kernel developers due to the importance 
of multiple trees.  I'm not really worried about the performance of CVS 
since any problems here can probably be solved by adding some 
administrative meta data for caching and some tweaks to the back end.  
However, it sounds as if Arch and PRCS are pretty interesting, and I 
hope that a couple of people take a look at them to see how close it is 
to suitable.  My respect for BK is certainly been enhanced by this 
discussion, but I still would prefer a free (or failing that GPL) 
license. ;-)
