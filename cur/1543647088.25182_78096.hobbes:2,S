It's not just "kernel interfaces" which should go in before October
20th.  
If we really want the feature freeze to be real, we really will need
to be hard-nosed about what we accept after the freeze date.  (Said he
who is frantically trying to finish up a last couple of ext2/3
features in before 2.6.)
So I'd encourage folks to at least submit patches before Oct. 20th
when they are ready, and not try to save stuff for after feature
freeze....
