Please emit a [0/n] and the [m/n] as a reply so that threading-aware
mail readers can collapse and/or use delete-thread-at-a-time feature.
If there is no info in [0/n], let it be empty or a one,two-liner brief
introduction.

And [0/n] sometimes contain a diffstat which gives an approximate
line count of how big the patchset actually is.
