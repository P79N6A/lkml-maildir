I've just released a new version of the dietHotplug package.  It can be
found at:
	
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/linux-hotplug/diethotplug-0.4.tar.gz
or:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/diethotplug-0.4.tar.gz
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/diethotplug-0.4.tar.bz2
No functional changes since the last release, but the resulting binary
is about 1.2K smaller now thanks to Erik Anderson.
The project is now being hosted at:
	
http://linuxusb.bitkeeper.com:8088/dietHotplug
instead of the previous cvs tree at sf.net in the linux-hotplug
directory.
Changes since the last release:
	- patch for the Makefile and dietlibc stuff from Erik Andersen
	  (now can cross compile much easier, can build with uClibc,
	  and some size savings.)
	- renamed the dietlibc subdirectory to klibc
	- synced with my previous klibc changes
	- cleaned up remaining compiler warnings.
	- further Makefile tweaks.
	- more klibc tweaks, now binary is even smaller.
thanks,
greg k-h
