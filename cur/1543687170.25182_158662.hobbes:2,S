I wonder if a change to add a flag preventing *any* packet from being sent
on a NIC which doesn't have the proper source address would be politically
acceptable. I did that type of patch for 2.4.16 to prevent killing
routers by having the MAC change for an IP. It will hurt performance on at
least some routers, and the patch eliminated the problem.
I later changed to using source routing, since the number of IPs was
modest and didn't change, but I am still fighting the issue in a test
environment, where the number of IPs is high and I can't just grab a range
in some cases.
