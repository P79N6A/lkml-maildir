Not sure if I'm reading your sentiment correctly, but...
It came from the ARM tree, where it had one specific problem to solve -
how to change the CPU core frequency in a safe way.
"Safe way" means informing drivers that they need to quiesce their DMA,
_carefully_ reprogramming the SDRAM timings so we don't lose system
memory, etc.  Locking was (iirc) semaphore based because we used notifier
lists and the like which could sleep (and drivers did and continue to
sleep in the callbacks).
It then got battered into working for x86, which brought a new realm of
locking issues.
Maybe the right answer back in years gone by was to be hard-nosed about
it and said "hands off, this is ARM only, invent your own".
Therefore, if you are intending throwing out cpufreq, I'd like to replace
it with the ARM-only version instead - we _require_ this infrastructure
for the correct operation of some ARM platforms.
