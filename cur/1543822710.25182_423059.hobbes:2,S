Hi All!
I am working on a project where the hardware is Asymmetric Multi
Processing Systems(ASMP).
In my system I have one ARM9,  four ARM7s'.
1. Can I use one Linux Kernel for all the CPUs in an ASMP system. (or)
    Should I use One Linux Kernel for ARM9 and RTOSes for ARM7.
2. If my hardware would come up in future with another ARM7 does linux
scale for the new CPU.
Can anyone please direct me to the source/docs how to use Linux for
ASMP systems.
Thanks,
krs
