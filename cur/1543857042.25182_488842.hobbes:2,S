What's the point of this question? Your answer is/was in the "[...]" part.

Fact: there _are_ users which need a timer facility (e.g. the scheduler).

Maybe the existing code should have been cleaned up first? Unfortunately 
the dynticks feature seems to more appealing than clean code...

Would you please stop these personal attacks?

Since this is very important code, it would be rather useful to know 
what's coming and to get to an agreement about the general direction this 
code is taking. This code has to cover a wide range of applications, where 
as you guys are rather focused on realtime applications, which is ok, but 
we need to _carefully_ rethink how time is managed within the kernel, 
instead of randomly poking around in the kernel.

Why do you pick on the NTP code? That's actually one of the places where 
assumptions about HZ are largely gone. NTP state is updated incrementally 
and this won't change, but the update frequency can now be easily 
disconnected from HZ.
