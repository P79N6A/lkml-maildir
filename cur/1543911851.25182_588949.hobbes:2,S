Power it off when not used for some time.  Power on when opened.  -EBUSY
while powering on and before it stablizes, if you don't want to get anything
userland stuck in D state.  This much work might not make sense if your
accelerometer doesn't waste resources when enabled.
Heck, try to get rid of that position sysfs crap if you can! It was a bad
design idea for hdaps to come up with, there is no reason to let it leak to
other drivers.
Input devices are the way to go for this, a joystick-emulation input device
(for games and toys), plus a input device that outputs accelerometer data in
micro (or mili?) gravities (generic stuff that works with all accelerometers
should use this one) and a raw accelerometer data input device (for higly
specific signal processing apps) when possible.
HDAPS (the one that matters, which ships in tp_smapi) lacks the g-normalized
device, though, but it would be a proper generic accelerometer interface.
The in-tree hdaps driver is basically ignored.  So some other accelerometer
driver gets the dibs on how to implement those interfaces in a proper
generic way.  Want to be the one? Please?  We in hdaps-devel can certainly
help with ideas and fix out-of-tree hdaps to also implement the interface.
