Hi,
This is the 2nd Part of my patch. It is a simple elf-object loader
inserting modules wich are loaded at boot time into the kernel.
It depends on the 1st part, but if you don't like the multiboot thing 
this could be easily made to work with old style boot-loaders 
(If you add aditionaly features to the boot-loader).
Mfg, Christian Koenig. (and sorry for my poor English).
