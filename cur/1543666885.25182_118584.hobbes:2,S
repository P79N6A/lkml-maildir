Subject: Re: Ptrace patch for 2.4.x BREAKS kill() 2 interesting effects for .pid and dot locking? (was Re: Ptrace hole / Linux 2.2.25)

I am eating my own shorts here....
kill() 2 does actually behave the way it is supposed to.
BUT these are correct:
- Debian netsaint does definitely have problems with its Web frond end
NOT being able to some see the netsaint process running as netsaint user
from the Web server running as www-data.
- User Mode Linux SKAs mode is definitely BORKED!
Work around described below is correct as far as I have read.ie
recompile kernel with no auto-module loading, or echo garbage executable
name (one that does not exist) int /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe.
Best Regards

    Hi There!
    
    Sorry about making a racket, but I am posting this for the edification
    of all, as there is a work around without breaking your server for this
    one.
    
    As you can read below, I have found that the patch on 2.4.x also BREAKS
    kill() 2 when executed for signal 0 on a process ID that the user is not
    the owner of, except for root of course.
    
    This has all sorts of interesting effects for processing .pid files, and
    probably dot locking.....  Makes the patch as it stands unacceptable for
    2.4.21, and vendor kernels I would say... (See below for effects on
    Debian netsaint...)
    
    I have been just digging harder, and the vulnerability is only
    exploitable if you are using the kernel auto module loader, so compile
    your kernel with out auto module loader enabled, or echo some garbage
    into /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe after loading all your modules.  It has
    to be an invalid executable name in there as any executable file will
    open the bug to exploit.
    
    Here are the effects on a netsaint box I look after:
    
    bucket: -foo- [~] 
    $ ls -l /var/run/netsaint/netsaint.pid 
    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root            5 Mar 19 16:32 /var/run/netsaint/netsaint.pid
    
    bucket: -foo- [~] 
    $ cat !$
    cat /var/run/netsaint/netsaint.pid
    4276
    
    bucket: -foo- [~] 
    $ kill -0 4276
    bash: kill: (4276) - Operation not permitted
    
    and the netsaint Web front end can't find the process alive that it
    wants to talk to via a unix pipe so that it can start and stop
    notifications etc....
    
    Could I please say this to the kernel developers, please fix it
    properly!
    
    Thanks heaps,

        Dear All,
        
        The patch also breaks kill(2) on a process with signal number 0 - This
        is used by a lot of monitoring programs running as one user ID to make
        sure a process with another user ID is running.
        
        This causes trouble with packages like nagios and netsaint, as well as
        other stuff.
        
        Alan, don't want to bash you around, but isn't there another fix
        possible that doesn't break this function call and UML skas mode?
        
        Cheers,

            Alan,
            
            This patch really breaks UML using the skas mode of thread tracing skas3
            patch on quite a significant amount of machines out there. The skas mode
            is a lot more secure than the traditional UML tt mode. I guess this is
            related to the below...
            
            I am running a UML site that a lot of hospitals ad clinics in Bangldesh
            depend on for there email.  It allows them to work around the corruption
            and agrandidement of the ISPs over there.  The skas3 mode patch is
            needed for the site to run securely.  Tracing thread mode does not cut
            it.
            
            There are also a large number of other telehoused ISP virtual hosting 
            machines that use this stuff, and it is actually proving to be quite
            reliable.
            
            I have attached the skas3 patch that Jeff Dike is currently using, and
            the patch that you have produced.  Could you please look into the clash
            between them, and get it fixed.
            
            Thank you - there are lots out there who will appreciate this.
            
            Cheers,

            The dumpability is per mm, which means that you have to consider
            all the cases of a thread being created in parallel to dumpability
            being enabled.
            
            So consider a three threaded process. Thread one triggers kernel thread
            creation, thread two turns dumpability back on, thread three ptraces
            the new kernel thread.
            
            Proving that is safe is non trivial so the current patch chooses not
            to attempt it. For 2.4.21 proper someone can sit down and do the needed
            verification if they wish
