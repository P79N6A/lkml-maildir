The timeout is converted from usecs to jiffies before assigning it to 
chip->vendor.timeout_*, so even with boxes with different configured HZ, 
those values would be the same in usecs.
Hopefully there's no way to modify HZ in runtime.

Yes, the timeout_cap struct isn't appropriate here to read the 
TIS_DURATION capability, which has a different meaning from the timeout 
one and hasn't a forth field to be assigned. I'll write the duration_cap 
struct and make use of it here and resubmit this patch.

Yes, it's inside tpm_vendor_specific struct, but this one has __be32 
fields. The tpm_vendor_specific struct has these timeout fields and  but 
also a bunch of others, so unfortunately no reuse could be done.
Thanks reviewing it,
