one of the advantages the current _and_ future vserver project
has over 'changing/setting some features for a process' is the
concept of a context layer, residing between kernel and processes
_belonging_ to a context ...
you could, for example set up a context which allows a maximum
of 10 processes, limited to one ethernet interface, using it's
own root/user quota, start some 'virtual' server in this context
doing all this init stuff, and then visit this context from
outside, via a simple 'context' change ... if you've got the
right capabilities/permissions ...
I can not imagine how you would do that with the /proc/<pid>/attr/
interface, but I'm sure you can explain it to me ...
best,
Herbert
