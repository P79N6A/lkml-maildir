Jamie, libraries, like for example libevent, are completely generic indeed.
They fetch events and they call the associated callback. You obviously
know inside your callback which kind of fd you working on. So you use the
reading function that best fit the fd type. Obviously the read(2) trick
only works for stream type fds.

Obviously, POLLRDHUP is not yet inside the kernel :)

This does not apply with non-blocking fds.

You obviously need an EPOLLPRI check in your read handling routine if you
app is expecting urgent data.
