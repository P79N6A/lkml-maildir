That depends on your definition of 'break'. It should prevent abuse.
To pick a specific example, since you like them: where userland programs
are including atomic.h, and hence writing programs which don't compile
on some architectures, and which compile on others but silently give
non-atomic results, it's perfectly acceptable and indeed advisable to
prevent compilation across the board.
Some people might call that breakage; I don't.
