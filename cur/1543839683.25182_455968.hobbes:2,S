Atomic bitops define orders *between* them not *around* them.  ie. if
you have two atomic bitops on the same bit, they're ordered one way or
the other.  As the workqueue code currently stands, ordering around
the bitops is the caller's responsibility and fddef does it with a
spinlock.  As the producer and consumer usually access a common
resource, that kind of synchrnoization is inherent in most cases.

Let me revise the diagram.
            Queuer                         Worker
             lock
         -------------             <--- clr pending --->
        | produce job |                       |
        |             |                       v
         -------------                  trying to lock
            unlock                            v
               |                        lock granted
               v                       --------------
     <--- set pending --->            | consume jobs |
                                      |              |
                                       --------------
                                           unlock

Queue being a shared resource, people usually synchronize around it.

That would help if the producer and consumer depend on memory ordering
for synchronization, which usually isn't the case.  I'm not sure
whether adding that is a good idea or not.  IMHO, it's better to use
explicit memory barriers with enough comments in such subtle cases to
make things clear.
Either way, fddef is just straight forward producer-consumer case with
no need for requeueing mechanism.  There is no need and no other user
does anything similar.
Thanks.
