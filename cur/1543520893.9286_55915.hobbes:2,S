are you really sure that application programmers allocate space for dates
based on sizeof(date var) and do not assume that that is 32 bits?
this is like the statement that was made last year on a firewall list that
anyone who remembered the leap year calculation was something other then
y/4 would remember the entire formula, this was discredited in the very
next post by someone who agreed that the formula was y/4 unless y/100
(forgetting except y/400)
I would lay serious money down that a lot of stuff that stores dates in
binary files only allocate 4 bytes for it without checking it's size.
(and yes I realize that this bet cannot really be settled until the 2038
"crisis" hits)
