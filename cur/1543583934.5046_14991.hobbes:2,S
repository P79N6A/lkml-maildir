There are no threads in Linux.
All tasks are processes. 
Processes can share any or none of a vast set of resources.
When processes share a certain set of resources, they have the same
characteristics as threads under other OSes (except the huge performance
improvements, Linux processes are already as fast as threads on other OSes).
Execution contexts which share resources do not have to share memory. If we
implemented top to aggregate such processes (as you suggest), the result
would also be potentially misleading. 
If we were to break compatibility it should be actually fix the situation,
not replace once misleading situation with another.
Sometimes it is handy to view a collection of execution contexts as a
singular object. However, such is also the case with a service implemented
as a collection of share-none standard unix processes (like postfix). A
better solution would be a more generalized system for service object
management. Such a solution could likely be implemented without kernel
intervention (though perhaps a general facility to determine what shares what
with who might be needed).
