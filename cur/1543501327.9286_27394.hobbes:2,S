	Hi Andries.
	I have a qlogic scsi adapter and am trying to mount a 18GB drive.  You
	touch upon my problem in the HOWTO, Sect.10:
	aha152x, pas16, ppa, qlogicfas, qlogicisp:
	     H=64, S=32 unless C > 1024, in which case H=255, S=63, C =
	min(1023, M/(H*S)). (Thus C is truncated, and
	     H*S*C is not an approximation to the disk capacity M. This will
	confuse most versions of fdisk.) The ppa.c code uses
	     M+1 instead of M and says that due to a bug in sd.c M is off by 1. 
	What I haven't found, is what to do.  Am I just screwed?
	Thanks,
	Rudy Pawul
With an unpatched kernel, yes.
The patch below (which can be applied to all kernels (2.0.*, 2.2.*, 2.3.*)
will enable you to use more than 8 GB with a qlogic adapter.
