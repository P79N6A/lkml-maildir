Ingo, thanks to help from Steve Rostedt I got 2.6.14-rc3-rt12 to compile
with CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y on x86_64 smp. Unfortunately if I enable 
it along with latency tracing (which is causing the crash during boot) 
it crashes so early that I can't get anything from the serial console,
even using earlyprintk. All I get is a blank screen for a few seconds
then the machine reboots.
I have all other debugging options disabled (apart from necessary dependencies 
for these two). This of course means that I can't confirm whether the crash
is caused by stack overflow.
With latency tracing disabled but CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y the kernel 
boots and runs fine.
BTW this is still with initrd. If the stack footprint is likely to
be smaller with initramfs I'll give it a try, but it'll be a few days
before I can set this up (I still have to work out how to use initramfs).
John
