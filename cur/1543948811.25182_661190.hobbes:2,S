I think that is a separate thing. Bootup default is one thing and being able
to explicitly allow/disallow kernel activity on a CPU(s) is another.
I think "boot" or "set0" makes perfect sense. In fact that was the first thing
I noticed when I started playing with it. ie Even if I just wanted to isolated
 one cpu I now need to create a cpuset for the other cpus and move all the
tasks there explicitly. It'd be very useful if it happens by default.
