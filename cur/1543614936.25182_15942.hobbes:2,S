I tested your suggestion with an 2.4.17rc2aa2 kernel,
but it didnt help.
The system dies after copying more then 6-8GB on data.
Here are the last lines from /var/log/messages:
Dec 30 01:47:32 localhost kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x70/0)

I started to begin searching in the linux/fs/buffer.c, and found the
following interesting lines (line: 1450+):
void create_empty_buffers(struct page *page, kdev_t dev, unsigned long blocksize)
{
	struct buffer_head *bh, *head, *tail;
	/* FIXME: create_buffers should fail if there's no enough memory */
	head = create_buffers(page, blocksize, 1);
	if (page->buffers)
		BUG();
	bh = head;
Could the create_buffer function cause this problem ?
