Hey, I know! This is a radical idea, but what if we put the name at the 
head of the file, and called it
	arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c
instead? Then we could teach each of i386 and x86-64 to include it from 
that area, and we could put other shared files under the same directory 
hierarchy so that it would be easy to see which ones are shared?
Crazy idea, I know. But I think I saw somebody send out a patch kind of 
like that, so maybe this common naming scheme could be as simple as just 
applying a few patches once they got cleaned up and re-organized some 
more.
