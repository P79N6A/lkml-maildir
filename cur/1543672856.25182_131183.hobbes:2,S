To allocate stacks for the threads in nptl we currently use MAP_32BIT to
make sure we get <4GB addresses for faster context switching time.  But
once the address space is allocated we have to resort to not using the
flag.  This means we have to make 2 mmap() calls, one with MAP_32BIT and
if it fails another one without.
It would be much better if there would also be a MAP_32PREFER flag with
the appropriate semantics.  The failing mmap() calls seems to be quite
expensive so programs with many threads are really punished a lot.
