Hello folks!
I am thinking whether linux can be ported to a DSP chip. I would like to
know if it is possible, given that it doesn't have a cache and not a huge
amount of memory etc. If anybody thinks it is possible, can you please tell
me where to start and how to go about doing it?
When I say linux, I don't mean linux servers; just the basic kernel with
its networking features. I am toying with this idea because a DSP chip is
considerably cheaper than the present day pentium. 
Thanks in advance
Cheers,
