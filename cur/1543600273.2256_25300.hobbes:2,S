Subject: PATCH: linux-2.4.10-pre4/drivers/net/irda/irda-usb.c incorrectly matched to other USB devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	linux-2.4.10-pre4/drivers/net/irda/irda-usb.c was missing a
match flag in its array of usb_device_id's, causing it to claim
and attempt to talk to at least one completely incompatible device:
the D-Link DWL-120 USB wireless ethernet adapter.  The hot plugging
code also uses this information, causing the irda-usb driver to be
helpfully autoloaded so that it can incorrectly claim this device
even if the module was not originally loaded.
	I have verified that, with this patch, the irda-usb driver
is no longer incorrectly loaded when a DWL-120 wireless ethernet
adapter is plugged in.
	To all the appropriate people: please apply this patch.  Thanks
in advance.
