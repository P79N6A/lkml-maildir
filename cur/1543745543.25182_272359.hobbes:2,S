Yes, diethotplug is based on my old package called, supprise,
diethotplug, and is located at
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/
But that only does module loading.  The "full" replacement of today's
/sbin/hotplug functionality needs this hotplug multiplexer, and a
diethotplug replacement (which can get much smaller than the current
diethotplug due to the way modprobe works in 2.6.)
