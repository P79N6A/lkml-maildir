It's the result of doing

when %edx is 0x00040000.
That looks to me like a single bit-flip in memory, and get_hash_table is
one of those functions that shows up in traces all the time when you've
got bad memory (it's one of the kernel's hottest functions for doing
list-walks over dynamically-allocated data structures.)
This footprint would definitely have me reaching for memtest86 as the
next step.  It certainly has all the hallmarks of a classic bit-flip bad
memory trace.
