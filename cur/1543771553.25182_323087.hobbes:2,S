Hi All,
  Can a device-driver (a generic serial driver)
support more than one device from different vendors
(hence different vendor ids and device ids)? If so,
during the boot time how the pci_device_id structure
gets the info about the drvier_data?  Would like to
know the name of the function name(s) and file(s) that
are used for this process.  Thanks a lot.
Ananda Krishnan
