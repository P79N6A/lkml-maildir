Note that there are other outstanding issues with eCryptfs on NFS. For
instance, prepare_write()/commit_write() have gone away in -mm,
leading to an oops when eCryptfs tries to call them directly, which is
well deserved, since eCryptfs really should not be doing that. Unionfs
has just two places where it calls vfs_read() and vfs_write()
respectively; eCryptfs is a bit more complex, with multiple write
paths that end up writing encrypted data and updating metadata in the
header. I am currently trying to find a way to convert everything over
to vfs_read() and vfs_write() in eCryptfs, in a way that does not
ultimately result in a kernel hang.
