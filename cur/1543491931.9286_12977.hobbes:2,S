Subject: problems with bttv drivers (again :(

I've got sound problems with the bttv drivers on 2.2.5ac3, so I want
to roll back to a previous version I know I had working and take things
from there.
Unfortunately I no longer have a copy of xaw-2.35, which is where I was
getting the drivers from (and neither is it still available from
http://www.in-berlin.de/User/kraxel/xawtv.html
).
Can anyone point me in the direction of a copy I can download ?
Thanks,
James.
