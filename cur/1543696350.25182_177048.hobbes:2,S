You can't set a block size larger than page size.

Urgh. Whereas with FTL, NFTL etc. you can just fill in new sectors
individually in the newly-allocated eraseblock. 
Surely you're not actually erasing the block and then praying you don't
lose power before writing the new contents back? There's some kind of
chaining from the old to the new block? Can't you say which sectors are
valid in the new block, and which should still be used from the old?
I wouldn't advocate setting the block size even to 4KiB, since that'll
waste a lot of space. But we could certainly make use of request merging
if what you're doing really is necessary -- we can make a
'write_sectors' function which writes more than a sector at a time.
