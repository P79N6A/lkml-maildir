I don't think it will. My analysis of yesterday night was:
- no silly rename is done
- this is because d_count equals 1
- this is because we have two different dentries for the same file
- this is caused by the fragment
        /* If we're doing an exclusive create, optimize away the lookup */
        if (nfs_is_exclusive_create(dir, nd))
                return NULL;
in nfs/dir.c.
Do you agree?
