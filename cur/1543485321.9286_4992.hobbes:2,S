The proprietary OSS sound drivers do exactly this:  actually there's a
script run at boot-time that tries to recompile the binary compatibility
layer against the new kernel's header files.  That keeps the number of OSS
revisions required to support Linux 2.0 and Linux 2.1 on SMP and Red Hat 
systems down to about eight or nine.
