The swapOUT clustering is only done to a maximum of 32 (2^5)
pages, so it doesn't make much sense to read in more pages
(which are probably unrelated to the current process).
For mmap() reading we might want to switch to a smarter
algorithm though. Not with reading in more pages, but with
reading in the _next_ area while the program is still busy
processing this one. The idea is to have all data in memory
just before the process needs it :)

We do I/O on this device in chunks of PAGE_SIZE.

Of course, we want to have our swap device read-write and we
mark it with a magic number so no harm will come to it...

Hmm, haven't we seen this one before? Stephen?

AFAIK it's not yet documented. I'd really appreciate it
if you could do that and send me the docs for inclusion
on the Linux-MM site...
