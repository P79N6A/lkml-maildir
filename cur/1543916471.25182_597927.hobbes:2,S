Did you test with lockdep enabled?
=============================================
[ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
2.6.23-rc7-mm1 #1
---------------------------------------------
swapper/1 is trying to acquire lock:
 (&writer->lock){--..}, at: [<c0197a32>] lock_and_coalesce_cpu_mnt_writer_counts+0x32/0x70
but task is already holding lock:
 (&writer->lock){--..}, at: [<c0197a32>] lock_and_coalesce_cpu_mnt_writer_counts+0x32/0x70
other info that might help us debug this:
1 lock held by swapper/1:
 #0:  (&writer->lock){--..}, at: [<c0197a32>] lock_and_coalesce_cpu_mnt_writer_counts+0x32/0x70

 [<c0103b47>] kernel_thread_helper+0x7/0x10
 =======================
It look like a false positive to me, but really, for a patchset of this
complexity and maturity I cannot fathom how it could have escaped any
lockdep testing.
