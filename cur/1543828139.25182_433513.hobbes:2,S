Hi.
Sorry for coming late to the party. I've only just seen this thread, and have 
had reports of it too.
My concern is, shouldn't we be dealing with the cause rather than just one 
symptom (and as Pavel rightly wondered, assuming there aren't more)? I'm not 
sure that I have a solution, but I think the point is worth raising again.
Do we want something like adding the process's task struct to timer data, and 
get the timer code to delay firing timers for frozen processes?
Regards,
Nigel
