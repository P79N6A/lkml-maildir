The problem here is that if connector is compiled as a module and
fork_connector as builtin there will be undefined reference to symbol
like 'cn_already_initialized' or 'cn_netlink_send'. That's why the
fork_connector() must be enable if CONFIG_CONNECTOR and
CONFIG_FORK_CONNECTOR are selected as builtin and not as a module. I
agree that it's not very elegant...

Yes but cn_netlink_send() is looking for a callback with the same idx.
As I don't use any callback, found == 0 and I have an error "Failed to
find multicast netlink group for callback[0xfeed.0xbeef]". So the good
call is: cn_netlink_send(msg, CN_IDX_FORK);
Thanks for your help,
