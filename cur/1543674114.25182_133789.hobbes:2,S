The real problems are more subtle:
Consider someone uses neither CRYPTO_HMAC nor INET_AH and later changes 
his .config using menuconfig - the "default" does _nothing_ since 
CRYPTO_HMAC already has a value.
Thinking more about this issue it seems the "enable" feature in the
latest Kconfig patch will be the correct solution.
