I had a similar problem today when I recompiled the src of 2.2 and tried
to boot from that image. The original kernel was 2.0.36.
The messages are different and the boot attempt fails as it hangs
initially after detecting my Ethernet (PCI NE2000 clone) card.
Do I have to upgrade any libraries or so???
Any tips welcome.
