Perhaps in theory.  But in practice, any fix bears some risk.
They have nothing against "obvious" fixes.  But unless additional
criteria are also met, such fixes are for someone else to apply.

Not at all.  Let me put it this way.
If a change that fixes a problem is included in a patch with another
change that makes trivial changes (typo fix, say), the patch will
be rejected.
The statement:
    "It must fix a problem and it must _not_ contain anything else,
     such as 'trivial' fixes."
is _obviously_ not the same as:
    "It must fix a problem."
(Notice how quickly even the obvious becomes unobvious ...;).
