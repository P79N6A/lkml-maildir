Then I wonder why the interface came up automatically when the card was
inserted.  By the way the relevant module is pcnet_cs, which is 16-bit
PCMCIA.  I didn't guess that the hotplug scripts were used for that.  But
I'll try to find time to test it with new hotplug scripts some weekend.
(Can't do it now, I'm in the middle of installing SuSE 8.2 on that machine.)
