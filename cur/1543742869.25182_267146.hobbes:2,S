Hi,
well, how would i best check for the presence of the process/thread "IRQ 8"?
A quick glance through the output of apropos pid didn't show anything. i
suppose in the worst case i'd have to iterate over the list of all processes
and find the one that matches the name. Dunno how to do that either yet. If
it's fairly straightforward, i'll add it.
Although: is rtc always garanteed to be "IRQ 8" or is this only the case on
ia32 with XT-PIC?
?
