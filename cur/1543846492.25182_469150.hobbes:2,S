    [PATCH] VFS: Make filldir_t and struct kstat deal in 64-bit inode numbers
    These patches make the kernel pass 64-bit inode numbers internally when
    communicating to userspace, even on a 32-bit system.  They are required
    because some filesystems have intrinsic 64-bit inode numbers: NFS3+ and XFS
    for example.  The 64-bit inode numbers are then propagated to userspace
    automatically where the arch supports it.
    [...]
Doing this will mean XFS won't be able to support 32-bit inodes on
32-bit platforms the above (merged) patch --- though given that cheap
64-bit systems are now abundant does anyone really care?
