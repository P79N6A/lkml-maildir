The tradeoff here appears to be:
- it's hard to do stuff reliably after an Oops has occurred, for obvious
reasons
- it's non-portable to define what should happen at reboot time
(i) should be to the serial port, I think.  The console is about to be wiped
clean by the BIOS at reboot time, and there could be anything on the
parallel port.
(ii) should ideally be something which an SNMP-based network monitor could
make sense of.
I think (iii) could be feasible if there were a specialised dump partition
(the preferred dump location for VMS is a preassigned dump file, for
example), which could perhaps be part of the swap partition, but needn't be
- a lot of people don't have huge swap partitions anyway.  Most people
aren't interested in dumps, but for sites with big servers, a dedicated
partition for dumps would be part of prudent OS installation planning.
