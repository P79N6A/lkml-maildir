Yes, I know this, and I appreciate that sysfs does this generically in
order to get better type checking etc. Maybe it'd be possible to also
give each node a void* data pointer that get's passed around to the
store/show callbacks and hence it doesn't need to do any container_of
conversion but rather cast that data pointer. I'm not really sure, but I
think that the setup required for configfs is a bit too much since one
is essentially implementing what would in sysfs be a subsystem for every
node time.

Yes, I know that.

Ah, will that new one in pending start out with the same set of
parameters as the one in live? I guess there could be a callback when
something is added to pending so that it can be filled in to look the
same.
Another question. For this application we'll probably need something
like
/config/cfg80211/wiphy0/eth0/type <- type of interface: sta, monitor,...
/config/cfg80211/wiphy0/eth0/sta/ <- sta attributes, e.g. 'ssid'
but if the type changes, those sta attributes ought to disappear. It
seems that I should be able to do that, but I'm not sure how it would be
done in pending. That is, when in pending I have an object and someone
sets the 'sta' type then the 'sta' attributes directory must show up.
Thanks,
johannes
