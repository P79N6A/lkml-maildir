No, be quiet, they are not in /dev/null ;).
Did you compiled the kernel SMP, right? If so I am not interested about
SMP scheduling problems of stock 2.2.13, while I'd like to know if you
could reproduce with this my patch applyed. I never run (or recommend to
run) one 2.2.x late kernel without it applyed.
