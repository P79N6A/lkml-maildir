Not unless they do it from India. M$ has just invested many millions
in a "campus-like" facility in Bangalore, India, about 2 km from
the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). IBM already has such a facility
designed to reduce the cost of software development. I think we have
some persons from that IBM facility on "the list", that may offer some
idea of when the new Microsoft facility will be finished (it was a
recent ground-breaking). Microsoft intends to "continue to be a world
leader...etc..", and is positioning itself world-wide so it will not
even need the United States for distribution. This is its response to the
US lawsuits. Basically, they have outgrown the need for the United
States...

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
