That's more of a glibc-specific bug. Most other libc implementations
appear to be quite capable of providing a userspace 'readdir()' which
doesn't ever use the lseek() syscall.
Note however that NFS compatibility *does* provide a limitation here:
the cookies that are passed between client and server are limited to
32 bits (NFSv2) or 64 bits (NFSv3/v4), so you'll be wanting to provide
some hack to get around this...
Cheers,
