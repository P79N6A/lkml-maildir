I worked with Shailabh this week to run various testing and
debugging as he requested. I was pulled off to some urgent
task yesterday and surprising saw this coming this morning...
Let's slow it down please. My last testing (after your fix in
#2 below) still showed 109% overhead at system time. And, the
per-thread group processing also increase the rate of ENOBUFS
at the receiver.
I need to check with other guys to find out if 1000 threads/sec
indeed unrealistic at our customers' environments. A good
design should allow a mechanism to turn off the penalty due to
a feature that is not common to everybody. I do not understand
your objection.
