I reported too soon that x86_64 works. It does not work, it just takes
a bit longer before it freezes. There are message threads all over the
place discussing this problem with the HP Pavilion tx 1000, and it seems
the best workaround is to use the "nolapic" option instead of "noapic".
Using that, it is totally stable _and_ there are no spurious interrupts
that would otherwise break USB. Interrupt setup is a bit strange, though:
