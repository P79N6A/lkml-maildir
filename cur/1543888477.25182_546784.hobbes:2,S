The when part is what looks to make it racy. I'm guessing that we're
relying on udev to create those loop nodes. If so, I think any scheme
that creates more on demand would give transient mount errors while
it's waiting on udev to create more nodes.
Perhaps if we were to start with 8 loop nodes at init (as we have in
2.6.21), and then always maintain a margin of 8 (or 4, or...) when
they start being used or detached?
