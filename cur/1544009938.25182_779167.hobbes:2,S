The magic is to be found in Kbuild.include:
# Usage: $(call if_changed_rule,foo)
# Will check if $(cmd_foo) or any of the prerequisites changed,
# and if so will execute $(rule_foo).
if_changed_rule = $(if $(strip $(any-prereq) $(arg-check) ),                 \
        @set -e;                                                             \
        $(rule_$(1)))
This parts takes care of:
$(any-prereq) takes care of 1 and 2 in the above list
$(arg-check) takes care of 4 and 5 in the above list.
And record_mcount is part of the following definition:
define rule_cc_o_c
        $(call echo-cmd,checksrc) $(cmd_checksrc)                         \
        $(call echo-cmd,cc_o_c) $(cmd_cc_o_c);                            \
        $(cmd_modversions)                                                \
        $(cmd_record_mcount)                                              \
        scripts/basic/fixdep $(depfile) $@ '$(call make-cmd,cc_o_c)' >    \
                                                      $(dot-target).tmp;  \
        rm -f $(depfile);                                                 \
        mv -f $(dot-target).tmp $(dot-target).cmd
endef
Here we use fixdep to create a set of prerequisites - one for each
CONFIG_ symbol that is found in the prerequisites. And fixdep reads the
list of prerequisites in the $(dep-file) that is created by gcc in the
cc_o_c command:
cmd_cc_o_c = $(CC) $(c_flags) -c -o $(@D)/.tmp_$(@F) $<
So after reading this you know almost as much about kbuild as I do.
I will fix the record_mcount stuff somehow.
But not tonight. Busy with work-work.
