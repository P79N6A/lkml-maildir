My best recommendation is to buy Windows, and buy Windows Sourcer.   It
is THE best Windows/DOS disassembler I've ever seen.  Not only is the
asm generation excellent, along with somewhat-insightful code comments,
but it recognizes all DOS/Windows debugging info formats, so that your
assembly code will look even better if the vendor was foolish^H^H^Hnice
enough to include the symbol info.
