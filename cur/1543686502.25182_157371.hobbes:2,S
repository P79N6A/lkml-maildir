Bartlomiej chose "no_lba48" (I had "cannot_do_lba48"), but otherwise
the change is mine. I will contradict you that it is a bad idea -
indeed, it is an excellent idea.
(Indeed, I made the change just for making the code more readable,
but immediately afterwards, reading this more readable code,
I understood why people had been experiencing filesystem corruption.)
Your strange remarks about reading specs - no doubt everybody who
touches IDE code knows the specs.
I don't know whether you saw my first post - but just to be sure let
me repeat a bit. There are two things that both are called addressing.
One is drive->addressing, and it is the enum that it looks like you
are thinking of. The other is hwif->addressing, and it is a boolean.
If this is ever changed then we have to visit all occurrences, and
also that is easier with the new name.
