FWIW, this last reversion didn't do it quite right, the device-mapper was 
at 253 prior to this patches parent patch, and now its at 252, which is 
still a 'dump it all' change for both tar & dump.  Until things settle, 
I'm going to test and probably use the instructions that Dave Dillow just 
sent me, which should put it at 238 regardless.
