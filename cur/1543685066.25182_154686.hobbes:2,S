I haven't seen the patch :(  There is a little misdirection in that 
comment, however.  The kernel rounds up the time to the nearest 
resolution and then adds that resolution (resolution is 1/HZ, by the 
way).  The round up is required by the standard as is the add.  The 
add is to make sure the expiry time is AFTER and never before the 
requested time.
What is passed back as the remaining time is the true remaining time 
after this calculation.
The live lock would occur if the caller then used that time to sleep 
again (i.e. to complete the sleep) as the kernel would again add the 
1/HZ to the given value.  So each signal, the time would be extended 
by a jiffie.
The best way to solve this is to use the absolute time version of 
clock_nanosleep, but, sigh, that means a change in glibc.
