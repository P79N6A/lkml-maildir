Check out what Debian did for 2.2 ("potato").  Kernel and syslinux are
on a FAT floppy, and a second floppy holds a raw ext2 image, gzipped.
SYSLINUX.CFG begins like so:
  DEFAULT linux
  APPEND vga=normal noinitrd load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=16384 root=/dev/fd0 disksize=1.44
  TIMEOUT 0
  DISPLAY debian.txt
  PROMPT 1
Just before mounting the root filesystem, the kernel says "insert
floppy and press <enter>" or some such.
You can download the images at
  
http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/
See 'rescue.bin' (syslinux+kernel) and 'root.bin' (initrd.gz).

If you can count on having a BIOS that knows how to boot a CD-ROM (i.e.
the BIOS is new enough to be Y2K compliant) you can put a 2.88MB floppy
image on the CD for the BIOS to find.  Should be big enough for the
next year or two.
