I was not aware of this, thanks.

I don't see this.  The case that would be undesirable would be for a task
to have an audit context but to not have the thread flag enabled.  That isn't
the case.  This was the point Chris made in his Ack, although perhaps somewhat
tersely.

I think you are.  Or maybe the code was different two years ago so that the
above made sense.   
In the above scenario, audit is disabled, a new child is forked, we bail
early so there is no audit context (and now there is no flag in the thread
area).   Currently there is no way this task is ever going to be audited as 
there is no audit context.    If this task forks a new child, at this point
the value of audit enabled will determine if there should be a context 
allocated and it will allocate the TIF flag also.   I don't see your stopping
all processes scenario.
