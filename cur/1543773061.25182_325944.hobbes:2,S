Alan followed up with me but we did not reach any conclusion as to what 
was causing it to crash.  The main way I got it to crash was dd 
if=/dev/hde (root drive) of=/nfs/file.img bs=1M, I have not had any issues 
as far as copying files and such.  For you, is it on a particular box or 
boxes, have you tried copying the other direction?  I use NFS over UDP btw 
(v3).
# mount
mount:/disk/1 on /remote/1 type nfs 
(rw,hard,intr,nfsvers=3,addr=192.168.168.253)
