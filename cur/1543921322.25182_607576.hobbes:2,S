'irq' argument is gone from the entire tree, save for
drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c
drivers/scsi/sym53c416.c
drivers/scsi/NCR53C9x.c
drivers/scsi/NCR5380.c
drivers/net/hamradio/scc.c
drivers/ide/ide-io.c
So I'd say the task is within reach :)
All the irq handler cleanups have been checked into branch 
'irq-cleanups', and 'irq-remove' branch is rebased on top of that.
