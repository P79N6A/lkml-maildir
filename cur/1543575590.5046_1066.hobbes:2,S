Looks good, except that you need to keep the option flags for backwards
compatibility.  There are a *lot* of scripts out there which invoke
klogd with various options and they will fail with this change.  It is
OK to issue a warning message "klogd options -[iIpkx] are no longer
supported" as long as klogd continues to run.  Otherwise you will get a
lot of irate users complaining that klogd is failing at boot time.
