Here we go again...
With normal boot, I have no kbd nor mouse (both PS2).
2.6.9-mm1 detects them correctly:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
input: PS2++ Logitech <NULL> on isa0060/serio1
2.6.10-rc1-mm2 misses the two 'input' lines, I just get the 'mice:' one.
Booting with i8042.noacpi makes them work again.
BTW, what is that <NULL> ? 
I don't have the full logs, but 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 told 'Mouse',and
the next I have is -rc3-mm3 that says '<NULL>'.
TIA
