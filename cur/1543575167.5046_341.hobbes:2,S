Now that you mention it, every app that has bombed has been the type
that forks a lot. MpegTV, gtv, and make spring to mind. All apps drive
the CPU load up quite a lot, which was why I initially suspected
overheating. I don't see it on my other 2.4 boxes though which is
suspicious. But they don't get as much of a beating as this, which was
up until last week my main workstation.

Dave.
