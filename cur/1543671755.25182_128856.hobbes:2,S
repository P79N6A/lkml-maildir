I agree that this one lies in a gray area, being linearly faster (PIV 
notwithwstanding) but bigger too.
In the dawn of time, before God gave us Cache, my version would have been the 
fastest, because it executes the fewest instructions.  In the misty future, 
as cache continues to scale and processors sprout more parallel execution 
units, it will be clearly better once again.  For now, it's marginal, and 
after all, what's a factor of two between friends?
