Actually, wouldn't it be best to define bzImage to be
1. a traditional bzImage
2. an ELF file
3. the length of the elf file in decimal
catted together ?
The same thing could be done for other non-ELF boot image formats, and real
ELF can just keep the additional sections.
I don't know any image format it's incompatible with, it allows us to add
further data (and code, should we ever need it), and it's still relatively
simple to implement (not as simple as a magic nuber, but it's reliable and
extensible).
