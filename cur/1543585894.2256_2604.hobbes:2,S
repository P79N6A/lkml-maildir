	My 'device' only lives in the buffer cache.  I write
to the device 95% only from kernel space and then it is read
out in large 256K reads by a user-land daemon to copy to a file.
The user-land daemon may also use 'sendfile' to pull the
data out of the device and copy it to a file which should, as I
understand it, result in a kernel only copy from the device
to the output file buffers -- meaning no copy of the data
to user space would be needed.  My primary 'dig' in all this is the 
32-bit block_nr's in the buffer cache.
