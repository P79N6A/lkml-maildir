This is up to the NFS server, not to the underlying filesystem.  It
would be insane for every single local write() to have mandatory
O_SYNC semantics, even if it is required by the NFS protocol.  
In modern Linux implementations of the NFS server, you can specify
whether or not the synchronization semantics as demanded by the NFS
protocol, or whether the more relaxed async writebacks are done.
Obviously, this has some pretty serious performance vs robustness
implications.
