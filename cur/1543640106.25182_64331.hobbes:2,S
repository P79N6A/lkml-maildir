Tested. First time 2.5.31 + the patch booted it seemed to work, but hung
later on while compiling a 2.4.19 kernel. No messages of any kind. The
hang _seemed_ to coincide with the console screen blanker kicking in.
Second boot went ok and I made sure the screen blanker wouldn't kick
in while doing the compile, and it didn't hang.
This box is the only one so far I've seen this problem on, my other
Intel chipset boxes actually seem to work fairly well with 2.5.31.
