It seems to compile just fine. Here are the relevant snippets:
  UPD     include/asm-i386/asm_offsets.h
  CC      init/main.o
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  CC      init/do_mounts.o
...and...
  CC      fs/proc/proc_tty.o
  CC      fs/proc/proc_misc.o
  CC      fs/proc/kcore.o
Why did you believe it would not compile? (Just so I can be extra
careful about this kind of code in the future.)
