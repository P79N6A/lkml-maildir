> This leads to a yo-yo effect during system power-off shutdown and the
> last phase of hibernation when the disk is first spun down by the
> kernel and then almost immediately turned on and off by the BIOS.
> This, in turn, may result in shortening the disk's life times.

> Blacklist HP nx6310 that uses the AHCI driver.
