I looked around on www.kernel.org, and I found this directory:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/mm/
 but the most recent is:
broken-out-2007-11-20-01-45.tar.bz2      20-Nov-2007 09:45  3.4M
24-rc8-mm1 came out on Jan 17, only a week before 2.6.24 came out and the
merge window opened.  Since this stuff wasn't in there in rc8-mm1, but
did go into Linus's tree on Jan 30, it had at best 2 weeks for testing by
whoever pulled the git-x86 tree in that timespan...

A bugfix?
commit 9af993a92623e022c176459fa6607a564b9a7eaf

    x86: make ioremap() UC by default
    Yes! A mere 120 c_p_a() fixing and rewriting patches later,
    we are now confident that we can enable UC by default for
    ioremap(), on x86 too.
That's one hell of a patch series for a "bugfix" that goes straight-to-mainline.
