I had a similar problem, but with less RAM than you have, I think.
And it hung the whole machine that heavy, that not even SysRq was
responding.
On that machine I had no swap installed and only 64MB of RAM.
Adding just another 64MB of RAM made it go away.
This might be an VM-skb-interaction-issue, but I saw no solution
so far.
The problem persistent with several processor (Cyrix III, Intel
Pentium (MXX), AMD Duron), several Chipsets (VIA-598, Intel BX)
and 3 different NICs (Realtek 8139, 3c509TX, Ether Express Pro)
and only under 100MBit.
I could copy MANY files (smb, scp, ftp), but ONE single file with
about 60MB or more (I tried to receive ISO images) killed the
machine. The behavior was also very random. Twice I got a
panic, but had problems writing it down due to the screen
darkening because of APM or setting "reboot on panic" :-(
Just FYI.
I don't know, why adding 64MB made it go away. I tried very hard
to reproduce it with 128MB, but really couldn't :-(
