This is way *more* common than you think--I've seen it around
some big multithreaded OSS packages [can't remember which now].

Bingo. That's another way to "fix" it. Luckily, recursive locking
can be safely and quickly done in user space (I own this lock,
ergo I just inc the lock count).
The problem with deadlocks is when the scenario gets more complex
and you are trying to lock a mutex and the owner is waiting for
a mutex whose owner is waiting for a mutex that you own...this
more commonly happens when you don't know what the heck is going
on in the code, which unfortunately is very common on people that
inherits big pieces of stacks to maintain.

fork time is not an issue, as POSIX makes forks and thread incompatible
(in a nutshell, only the thread calling fork() survives, all the mutexes
are [IIRC] reinitialized or something like that...).

Should be not on the recursive side; as I said, that is easy to do
[currently NPTL does it with the futexes]. The deadlock stuff gets
hairier, but it's not such a big of a deal when you have your data
structures setup. It takes time, though.

Agreed. Deadlock checking though, has to be done in the kernel. For
the generic case it is the only way to do it sanely.
