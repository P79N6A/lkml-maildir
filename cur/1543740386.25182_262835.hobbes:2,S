ok, it seems it was coincidence that the mouse skipping started at the time
of my echo 1 > trace_enabled.. This time it just started sometime after
boot. The scheduler class of the different irq's seems to have no influence
[i experimented with SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_OTHER for irq 1, 8, 12 and 3 and 10
[the latter two are my soundcards irq's].

Btw: i just experienced two pauses again, so the patch didn't really fix it
:( hrmm..
I get the feeling that something indeterministic is going on. Still no BUG's
in either dmesg output nor in the syslog.
