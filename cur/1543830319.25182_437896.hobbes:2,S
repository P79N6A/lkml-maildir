uswsusp should be able to match suspend2's speed. It can do async I/O,
etc...

Doable in userspace with uswsusp.

Should be doable in userspace with uswsusp, too; I actually had raw
devices version at one point.

Better put it completely in userspace :-).

uswsusp does that... or did that at some point.

No problem for uswsusp.

What does that mean?
