I haven't seen any report of this on the list yet, there
is an error on linux/drivers/ide/ataraid.c line number 104
static int ataraid_make_request (request_queue_t *q, int rw, struct 
buffer_head * bh)
{
	int minor;
	int retval;
	minor = MINOR(bh->b_rdev)>>SHIFT;
			^^^^
struct buffer_head in linux/include/linux/fs.h
does not have member b_rdev anymore. Its late
and I'm a bit _lazy_ know. I will look at the
code tomorrow.
