Subject: [PATCH 10/10] uml: mmapper - remove just added but wrong "const" attribute
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/17/295

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
When enabling the mmapper driver I got warnings because this "const" miscdevice
structure is passed to function as non-const pointer; unlike struct
tty_operations, however, I verified that misc_{de,}register _do_ modify their
parameter, so this const attribute must be removed.
Since the purpose of the change was to guarantee that no lock was needed, add a
comment to prove this differently.
