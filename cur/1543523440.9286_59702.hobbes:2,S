Is this plain 2.3.39 or did you make any changes to
init/main.c:name_to_kdev_t or to include/linux/kdev_t.h:to_kdev_t ?
First, you should check the output of  lilo -q -v  for the lines that say
Options: "root=801"  or such. If all of them agree on "root=801", it's
init/main.c:name_to_kdev_t that is messing things up.
If one of them says something like "root=80" instead, it's somewhere
between stat(2) and LILO's bsect.c (look for "root=", without the double
quotes), possibly with glibc in the picture too. Let's hope it's
something else ;-)
