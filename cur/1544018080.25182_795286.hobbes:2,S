I have a patch set that introduces a lot more asm-generic headers where
I also need a generic way to check for this. The approach I chose
here was to check "#if __BITS_PER_LONG == 64" for anything that is
exported to user space. Maybe you can #define this in asm/types.h
and use this check in the parisc headers as well.
