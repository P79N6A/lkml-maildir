Consider the case where login (or some other such program - maybe ftpd)
switches uid but still has a lump of the shadow password file somewhere,
or of some unreadable config file.
Perhaps we should add a SIGCORE which just causes the kernel to drop the
process image as a core file (without necessarily killing the process).
