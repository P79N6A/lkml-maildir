Interesting grep. I found that cmpci, gdth, net1080 and nv_setup are affected
too in my rather old 2.6.18-rc4 tree. More importantly, I found a few ones in
2.4 that I will have to address.
Thanks guys for the good idea. Once again, it shows that pure code review
would considerably help finding such bugs.
Cheers,
Willy
