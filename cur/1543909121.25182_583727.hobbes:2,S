I don't speak for Joe, but:  If there is a good mapping from MAINTAINERS
to paths then more submitters will use MAINTAINERS more frequently.  A
side effect would be that outdated entries in MAINTAINERS would become
apparent more quickly, and updated more quickly.  Of course that's just
speculation --- but your comment on this "hub driver" entry, prompted by
Joe's patch, seems to support that speculation.
