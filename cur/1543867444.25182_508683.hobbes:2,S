Please fix your script.
Not only is the http:// protocol terminally broken (use git:// or 
master.kernel.org instead), your "(linus branch)" thing is on the wrong 
line and hard to see.
It's supposed to be something like
 "Please pull from [the linus branch at]
    master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perex/alsa.git linus
so that I don't even by mistake miss the branch-name (because it's on the 
same line). And http:// for git really is so broken (slow, unsafe) that 
you should never use it if you have any choice at all.
Pulled.
