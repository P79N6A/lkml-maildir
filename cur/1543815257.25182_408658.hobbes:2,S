Hi,
   Just an FYI -- I just grabbed 2.6.16 and installed it without a
problem.  However, when I went to rebuild the nvidia module and vmware
modules, I discovered that the lack of a definition for
KBUILD_BASENAME in linux/include/linux/spinlock.h cause these
components' builds to fail.  I added a stupid workaround and was able
to build and install these components, but I wanted to bring this to
your attention.
  Best wishes,
  ---S
