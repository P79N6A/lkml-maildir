You have to use spinlocks to provide a mutual exclusion to interrupts.
However, a process on CPU cannot sleep while holding a spinlock. So,
sometimes it's needed to create a derivative locking scheme, based
on spinlocks. A common trick is to combine semaphores and spinlocks.
I cannot be more specific without knowing your code.
