Good work.
However I believe you need to test the AUX IRQ in this case before you
use it, otherwise you'll have a lot of people with non-working keyboards
(the input queue is shared), and probably also non-working PCI cards
(BIOSes like to assign IRQ12 to PCI if no mouse is detected by the
BIOS).
You'll see whether this test is necessary if a lot of people report
problems without i8042.noaux.
That can only be seen after extensive testing on a lot of machines,
though. Fortunately 386's and 486's are more or less extinct now, and
with them a lot of the weirder keyboard controllers.
Btw, on standard x86, the AUX and KBD IRQs cannot be shared.
