The only one I'm aware of is the '-dao' option, but that's no good when what I 
really want to do is burn a CUE sheet and files, or copy another CD. It still 
expects an ISO file(or WAV, whatever) as input.
Actualy, the only use for that option that I'm aware of is to help a few 
troubled CD-readers.
