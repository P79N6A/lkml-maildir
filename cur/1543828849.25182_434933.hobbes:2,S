I agree in theory.  In practice however msi interrupts look like io_apics.
with a different register set and the use all of the same support facilities.
So until that part of the architecture is refactored it doesn't make much
sense.  There is a slightly better case for moving the code into a separate
file.  Namely I think I know of a second common implementation for x86_64.
At which point the files will probably be named msi-intel.c and msi-amd.c
Or something like that.  
The name msi-apic.c is at least as bad as putting the code in io_apic.c
