s/PARENT_PENALTIY// is a noop. The CHILD_INHERITANCE moves it from 50%
to 60% and center it in the middle. If something it will increase the
sleep_avg of the child that will lead to making the childs more
responsive. It sounds quite strange that backing out this, makes the
system more responsive. btw, Kurt developed this stuff with the object
of making it more responsive, not less. What could go wrong is that the
child will get more responsiveness than the parent and maybe for your
load the interactive app is the parent and not the child, dunno.
