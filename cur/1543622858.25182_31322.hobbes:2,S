So, a little testing with scsi_info shows my scsi drives do have
writeback cache on.  great.  What's interesting is they
must be doing additional work for ordered tags.  If they were treating
the block as written once in cache, using the tags should not change 
performance at all.  But, I can clearly show the tags changing
performance, and hear the drive write pattern change when tags are on.
