Thank you so much for the tip!  This seems to have solved my problem
too.
I changed my epson.conf file to just say
"usb"
instead of
"usb /dev/usb/scanner0"
and now, finally, it works.  I do hope the SANE documentation writers
get around to adding that little tidbit of info SOMEWHERE,  I was
tearing my hair out and rebooting back to 2.4 to use my scanner.  
Also, now that usb-scanner.ko is gone, a paragraph of help in the 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/docs/post-halloween-2.6.txt
file would be a great thing as well.
