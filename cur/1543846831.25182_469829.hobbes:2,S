Yep, I'm fine with Jim taking over maintainerchip of the pc87360
hardware monitoring driver.

All other entries in this file are uppercase.
I also doubt that anyone will ever search for "common methods module",
I'm not even sure I understand what it means. What's really important
here are the driver names IMHO, and you already have added entries for
these below - isn't that sufficient?

I'd prefer "HARDWARE MONITORING" rather than "LM-SENSORS", as all other
hwmon driver entries have. lm-sensors is really only the user-space
part now, and the kernel can live without it.

This is noise for this patch, it should be sent as a seperate patch.
