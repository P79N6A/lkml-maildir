Explain to me how you can simultaneously prefer /dev/random for its purely
theoretical advantages and yet want to throw exactly that advantage out
the window?
What is really called for is the addition of potential network randomness
without crediting it with entropy. And using /dev/urandom, now exactly as
strong as the /dev/random you propose[1]. And acceptable to everyone.

Then we shouldn't be pretending that they can generate secure random
numbers.
[1] Assume an SSL webserver with only network interrupts as a source of
entropy. If entropy is a bottleneck, you're in a catch-22: you must wait
for more traffic to generate keys, but getting more traffic depends on
generating said keys. Blocking = dropping connections = not handling n% of
load at all load levels. Thus, the application demands entropy produced is
greater than entropy consumed.
Assuming that's the case and you'd be able to run a system with
/dev/random+network "entropy", it will work just as well with
/dev/urandom+network "entropy". Blocking buys us nothing if entropy is
proportional to load and capacity is proportional to entropy.
