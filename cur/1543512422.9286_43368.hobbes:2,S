I'm astonished!  Such brilliance!
Surpisingly enought, such brilliance _is_ already in the kernel
(no need at all to change chmod(1) or anything else, for that matter).
We call it VFS.
Chmod, and other filesystem-related system calls, already do
something of that sort, so the myriad of programs in userland don't
have to.  In a nutshell, chmod does
    do some common operations that are independent of the specific FS;
    locate the filesystem handler for the named file;
    call the FS's chmod "method";
The FS's specific "methods" are free to implement the functionality
as they see fit, according to the underlying FS model they are
written to support.
No change to chmod(1), as chmod(2) already has the required
functionality.
Of course there are obvious (and not so obvious) races in such a
scheme.  Alexander Viro has been working on VFS, trying to resolve
all the races.  But those races _are_ solvable, or else we must
conclude VFS was a bad idea to start with.
I fail to see anything devfs-specific in this very particular line of
reasoning.
