Is there any reason why we couldn't via kernel routine let user space 
access read-only certain pages of kernel memory?  I.e. having the 
userspace function call the driver to map into it's (user) address space a 
read-only mapping of the drivers (kernel) private r/w area?
If I'm not mistaken this is doable on x86 hardware isn't it?
Cheers,
