I'm not sure I understand you...the kernel doesn't actually make the
assignments, relying on the BIOS to do so...am I wrong?
So, if the BIOS leaves a device in D3hot, it will loose it's
BIOS-assigned resources when it transitions to D0 in pci_enable_device.
The point of this patch is to restore those BAR assignments so that
the device's registers will be accessible to the driver.  The driver
remains blissfully unaware of the D3hot->D0 issue.

Currently pci_restore_state is only useful if there is a preceding
pci_save_state.  While this commonly occurs in the ->resume routines,
most drivers don't do any such thing (i.e. either save or restore) in
the ->probe routines.  This is likely because it only makes sense to
do so if you know about the D3hot->D0 issue; in that case, we would
be back to replicating code in any number of drivers.  I think we
agree that should be avoided.

If you are asking for additional patches (or more changes to this one)
then you'll have to be more specific.  I don't know what you want here.
Thanks,
John
