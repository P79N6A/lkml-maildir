No. It's for copying _from_ user space, ie a "write()" system call. So 
what it does is to effectively try to use non-temporal stores to the page 
cache - since the page cache is usually not read directly afterwards (at 
least not soon enough for L1 caches to help).
I don't generally like cache tricks either (caches tend to be better than 
humans, or at least get there fairly soon), but this one does seem very 
valid.
