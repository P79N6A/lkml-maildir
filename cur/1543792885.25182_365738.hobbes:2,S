If the library is actually a glue layer that smooths out the differences
between kernel API's, then that is exactly what I want to do.  There
is not a substantial amount of functionality.  In fact, it is mostly
macros.  The key word being, "mostly".  There is enough code in what
is not done in macros that it should not be compiled with every driver,
but not so much that it is worth making a separate driver library driver.  :)
So, it would still be very useful to know how to link against a "libmumble.a"
file built in another directory.  Copying all sources and libraries into
a build directory before kicking off the build is kludgey.  (Linux being the
only platform where that seems to be necessary.)
