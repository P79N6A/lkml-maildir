Hmpf, you're right.

Is there any mechanism in the driver core to avoid such races? The only
locking I can see are klists and dev->sem (which only protects
probing). AFAICS, the caller needs to ensure consistency anyway (like
with the subchannel mutex we introduced in s390 to ensure device
register and unregister cannot be called concurrently).
