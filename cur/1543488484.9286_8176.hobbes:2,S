 I agree completely. There will be some overhead when using systems like 
DIPC. That is because they are taking over some of the work that should 
be done by the programmer if he uses systems like PVM or MPI. Actually, 
this is true even in the case of PVM and MPI, as they rely on TCP sockets. I 
wonder if the best solution in your opinion is to program the networking 
adaptor directly? 
 We build abstraction layers, and deciding where to "stop" building more 
is somewhat arbitrary, and subject to discussion. 
 The point is, not all distributed applications need to get all the 
performance increase possible. Use the method you think is appropriate 
for you, and let others do the same.
