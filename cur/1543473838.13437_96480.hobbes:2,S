Hello,
I've just installed 2.2.0pre3 and somehow linux doesn't mount my dos
filesystems (those are fat32). It says that there is no msdos filesystem
present. But about a minute ago (under 2.1.132ac2) it was perfectly fine.
Furthermore I have a dos filesystem on a loopback device (this is fat16)
that does mount. The partitiontable information is correctly determined
and another e2fs also get's mounted without problem. Is this just my
system or is somebody encountering the same problems??
	Justin....
