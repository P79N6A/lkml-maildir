Small kernel image to flash (e.g. due to a size limit there), if you 
would aim for a small running kernel you wouldn't use modules.
And I'm not so sure about the image size without seeing actual numbers, 
e.g. for your device.
Especially comparing your all-modular approach with a CONFIG_MODULES=n 
kernel using Denys' section garbage collection patches in both cases 
would be interesting.
I'm not claiming you are wrong, all I say is that I'm not convinced 
without actual numbers that you are right.
