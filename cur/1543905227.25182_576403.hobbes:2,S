Oh yes, you're damn right. I did not notice that the ACK was higher than
the SACK, I'm more used to read traces with absolute rather than relative
seq/acks.
So I agree, it is this ACK which is lost between client and server,
reinforcing the supposition about the location of the capture (client side).

It would also be possible that something stupid between both ends simply
drops packets with the SACK option set. Also something which sometimes
happen is that some firewalls automatically translate sequence numbers
but not necessarily SACK values, which could pretty well lead to this
packet being received but ignored on the server side.
I'm pretty sure that the same trace taken on the server side will reveal
the reason for the problem.
