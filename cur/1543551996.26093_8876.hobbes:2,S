Subject: use of add_interrupt_randomness in drivers missing in many drivers

Hi!
Recently I needed a lot of entroy for cryptographic purposes on a
server and took a look at where the entroy for drivers/char/random.c
was coming from, as the server didn't have any activly used mouse/keyboard.
Anyway, I noticed that only 3 drivers were using add_interrupt_randomness()
to donate their irq timings into the entropy pool. Shouldn't other drivers
(especially network drivers) do this too ?
The only thing needed is to add the SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag to request_irq
in the drivers.
If nobody objects, I'll submit a patch that adds this to network drivers.
