Talking about IPMI - is there anyone working on SMIC interface to IPMI
driver written by Corey Minyard? (
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard
). He
isn't working on it personally as he told me, because he doesn't have such
HW.
I've just downloaded specification from intel and can start working on it
after I finish my other projects, but I am asking firstly, to avoid
implementing it if someone is currently doing it.
