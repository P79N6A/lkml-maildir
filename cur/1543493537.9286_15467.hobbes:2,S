Considering your plans to change behavior...
Please do not use the draft names without the draft behavior.
It will cause confusion, and security-related confusion is dangerous.
Avoid these names:
fI, fE, fP, pI, pE, pP, inheritable, inherited, effective, permitted
It would be best to avoid the whole "capabilities" term, which already
causes confusion with a "pure capabilities" system. Try "privileges".
Since you clearly do intend to break compatibility with the draft,
you might as well simplify down to a single set of bits as well.
(well, a "known bits" and "minimum needed" would reduce accidents)
