"when we clear its online flag" - This happens in take_cpu_down in the
context of stopmachine thread. take_cpu_down also ensures that idle 
thread runs when it returns (sched_idle_next). So when idle thread runs,
it should notice that it is offline and invoke play_dead.  So I don't 
understand why __cpu_die should time out.
