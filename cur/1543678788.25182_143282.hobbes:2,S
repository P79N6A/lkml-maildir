Hello,
I am using the latest 2.4-ac kernel (2.4.21-ac2) and trying to get support
for my WD Raptor SATA drive. The kernel detects the SATA controller just
fine and loads it as ide2 and ide3 -- but there is no detection of the
attached drive (which would presumably be hde). Anyone have any advice for
me?
Thanks,
Jeremy Redburn
ps. I've read of a similar problem at
