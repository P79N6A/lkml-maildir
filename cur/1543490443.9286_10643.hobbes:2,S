Something that happened to me twice: using 2.2.1, my 48 Mb-RAM laptop went
swapping to death. The first time, I rebooted. The second time, I hit
SAK-K.
Apparently, the culprit for the second time was some mixture of X and
Netscape 4.08. It was swapping so much I couldn't even control-alt-f1.
The problem with SAK-K under X is that it trashes the text mode. As I've
got a laptop, restoring text mode isn't trivial.
This leads to me to think that:
1 VC switching, EVEN UNDER X, should be handled by the kernel. I strongly
  think that the kernel should be the only one to switch video modes.
2 We perhaps could try to support VESA video mode changes using
  virtual-8086. This would take care of weirdo (read here: laptop)
  chipsets.
3 The kernel should detect that an application causes more than what is
  reasonable in swapping and kil that application.
Has something been done in any of these directions?
I wanted to do 2, but the documentation of vm86() hardly exists.
Could somebody that understands vm86() tell me how to use it?
Regards,
David
