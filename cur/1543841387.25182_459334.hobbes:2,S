This doesn't compile for me if CONFIG_SMP=n
          LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
        arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o: In function `cpu_init':
        (.init.text+0x1eda): undefined reference to `early_smp_processor_id'

        (.init.text+0x1f11): undefined reference to `early_smp_processor_id'
smp_processor_id() is defined for !SMP in include/linux/smp.h, I don't
know if it would be appropriate to add early_smp_processor_id() there
since it seems i386 specific. asm/smp.h isn't included by linux/smp.h
when !SMP but you could add an explicit include to common.c I suppose.
Ian.
