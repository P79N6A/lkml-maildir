If it was perceived I did, then I owe you an apology.

Ok somewhere is a bug. What is the body an if block, for you? To avoid
that confusion, I termed these "condition" and "code":
	if(condition1 ||	/* if() line */
	    condition2) {	/* continuation line */
		code;		/* body */
		code;		/* body */
	}
And I think I made that pretty clear in <
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/5/293>,
which part is what, and how I like things.
In <
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/6/133>,
 the loop begins then.
Yes, it does not match "(a) only use tabs", but it matches the
rest of kernel code.
