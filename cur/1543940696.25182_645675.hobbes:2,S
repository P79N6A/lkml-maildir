The goal here was to limit the instruction cache hit that we take when
mcount_enabled = 0.

well, actually, I disagree. I only set mcount_enabled=1 when I'm about to
test something. You're right that we want the impact of the test least
affected, but when we have mcount_enabled=1 we usually also have a
function that's attached and in that case this change is negligible. But
on the normal case where mcount_enabled=0, this change may have a bigger
impact.
Remember CONFIG_MCOUNT=y && mcount_enabled=0 is (15% overhead)
         CONFIG_MCOUNT=y && mcount_enabled=1 dummy func (49% overhead)
         CONFIG_MCOUNT=y && mcount_enabled=1 trace func (500% overhead)
The trace func is the one that will be most likely used when analyzing. It
gives hackbench a 500% overhead, so I'm expecting this change to be
negligible in that case. But after I find what's wrong, I like to rebuild
the kernel without rebooting so I like to have mcount_enabled=0 have the
smallest impact ;-)
I'll put back the original code and run some new numbers.
