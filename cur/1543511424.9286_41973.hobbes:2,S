I am now wondering if it *is* a bug in rm? 
I think the behaviour of rm could be explained as follows (not that
I have seen the source code). rm gets a listing of the drectory. It
then tries to delete all the files within that directory. When it sees
the error "file not found", it gets confused - how could that file
not exist, when I only just got its entry? So it assumes that a race
condition exists, where another process may have deleted it, and
re-reads the directory, hence seeing the same file again.
Perhaps it should really have a limit of how many times it will rescan
the same directory?
