Subject: [PATCH 08/22] [PATCH] scx200_acb: Fix resource name use after free
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
We can't pass a string on the stack to request_region. As soon as we
leave the function that stack is gone and the string is lost. Let's
use the same string we identify the i2c_adapter with instead, it's
more simple, more consistent, and just works.
This is the second half of fix to bug #6445.
