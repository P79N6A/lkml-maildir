Under normal preempt modes those functions would end running with
preemption disabled , but with PREEMPT_RT enabled they become
preemptive .. I may have been mistaken , but my impression was that one
mcr instruction was executed and it was atomic , so there was no need
for additional protection there..
If there are two mcr instructions then you could be preempted between
the two, which may be unsafe depending on what those instructions are
doing ..
