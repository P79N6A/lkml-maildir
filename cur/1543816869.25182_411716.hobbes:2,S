We run different tests to measure OpenVZ/Virtuozzo overhead, as we do 
care much for that stuff. I do not remember all the gory details at the 
moment, but I gave the correct numbers: "1-2 per cent or so".
There are things such as networking (OpenVZ's venet device) overhead, a 
fair cpu scheduler overhead, something else.
Why do you think it can not be measured? It either can be, or it is too 
low to be measured reliably (a fraction of a per cent or so).

  Kir.
