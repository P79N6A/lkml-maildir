So, why is it that my ATAPI MO drive works perfectly with ide-scsi and
sd but not with any of the IDE drivers (even if I hack them to accept
an ATAPI OPTICAL device)?
In 2.6, we have a patch allowing at least read-only use via ide-cd,
but writing still requires ide-scsi. I did the read support part, but
writing eludes me... and the read support is also unlikely to work on
MO discs with a sector size other than 2048 or partitioned ones (I only
use my discs as ext2 superfloppies).
