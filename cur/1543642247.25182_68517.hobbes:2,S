    Thanks for taking the effort of making a better building process
:) I hope you have success ;))

    Well, even though it is a beta release, please make the graphical
interface optional. I've had to tweak the Makefile since I haven't QT
on my system (nor G++, BTW).
    I couldn't do 'make install', but I haven't look the Makefile
(except for removing the QT part), so I don't know why it fails.
    The rest seems to be a great idea, so keep on working :)) It's
really great that you do this :)
