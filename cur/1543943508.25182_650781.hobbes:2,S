The VM shouldn't break if try_to_unmap doesn't actually make the page
freeable for whatever reason. Permanent pins shouldn't happen anyway,
so defining an ad-hoc API for that doesn't sound too appealing. Not
sure if old hardware deserves those special lru-size-reduction
optimizations but it's not my call (certainly swapoff/mlock would get
higher priority in that lru-size-reduction area).
