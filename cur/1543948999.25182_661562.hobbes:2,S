Sorry, for causing this confusion.
Unless you run a computer with the PIT or jiffies clock, this value is 
just a random value added to the calculation.
Even if you use the PIT clock, the drift isn't large enough to be worried 
about it with standard configurations. You have to manually set HZ to 2000 
and use the PIT clock, then you might have a need for this parameter.
