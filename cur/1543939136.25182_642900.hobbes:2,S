Care to explain why?
Following is an explanation why the contrary is probably true:
1) We have lots of precedents in existing code:
dmvo@cipher:~/Projects/misc/linux$ git-grep 'extern void' include | wc -l
5523
dmvo@cipher:~/Projects/misc/linux$
2) Linus' Coding style does not mandate what you requested.
3) The checkpatch.pl did not complain at this particular patch.
Thanks,
Dmitri
