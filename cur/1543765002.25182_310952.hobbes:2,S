Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 12, 2005 at 06:05:19AM CEST, I got a letter
where David Eger <eger@havoc.gtf.org> told me that...

Yes. Only changes files re-appear. The unchanged files keep the same
SHA1 hash, therefore they don't re-appear in the repository.
So, if Linus gets a patch which sanitizes drivers/char/selection.c,
only these new objects appear in the repository:
	drivers/char/selection.c
	drivers/char
	drivers
	. (project root)
	commit message
Kind regards,

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
