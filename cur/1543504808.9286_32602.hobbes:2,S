Hi Chris.

I did a fairly simple one-off tweak on all my systems that minimises
the possibility of that happenning. Basically, I ran tune2fs on all my
ext2 partitions, setting each to a different maximum mount count, with
the counts being prime numbers starting with 23. As a result, it is
rare for more than one to hit its limit at any given time - in fact,
as a minimum, two which were both sync'd today will hit their limits
in (23*29) = 667 days time, or the best part of two years hence...
Best wishes from Riley.
