Sounds to me like it's not a linux issue or a Duron issue.  My initial guess
is either poorly seated memory or bad memory.  Since no OS seems to want to
run, I wouldn't blame the processor.

hello there!
is there any1 who installed linux/unix on a AMD DURON based system?
i tried several distros with linux 2.2.14-2.2.16 but my system freezes in
the case of 2.2.14 and i got a kernel panic with 2.2.16.
ps.: i also tried with solaris 8 and winnt 4 and nothing worked.
any solution?
thanks michael
