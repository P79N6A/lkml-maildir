Subject: [PATCH] serial-2.5.26-5.diff.bz2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/21/160

The fruits of Ingo's wisdom and testing, now available from:
  
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/cvs/serial-2.5.26-5.diff.bz2
- serial console initialisation fix
- various smp fixes
- couple of build fixes
Please note that this almost matches the serial cvs, but contains one
extra bug fix.  This particular bug fix needs a little more work to
make it squeaky clean, so it hasn't been checked into cvs.  Serial cvs
at details can be found at:

Enjoy.
