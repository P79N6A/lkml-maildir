Hi Ben,
Apart from restoring the original state (Bring APICS back to virtual wire
mode), we also reprogram IOAPIC so that timer interrupt can go to crashing
cpu (and not necessarily cpu0). Look at following code in disable_IO_APIC.
                entry.dest.physical.physical_dest =
                                        GET_APIC_ID(apic_read(APIC_ID));
Here we read the apic id of crashing cpu and program IOAPIC accordingly.
This will make sure that even in virtual wire mode, timer interrupts
will be delivered to crashing cpu APIC.
I think we need to go deeper and compare the state of system (APICS,
timer etc) during normal boot and kdump boot and see where is the
difference. This is how I solved some of the timer interrupt related
issues in the past.
Thanks
Vivek
