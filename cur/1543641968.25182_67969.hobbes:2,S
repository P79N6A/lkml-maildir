Subject: 2.4.20-pre4-ac1 trashed my system

it trashed mine also.
supermicro p4dp8-g2 mobo
2x 2.2 Xeon
e7500 chipset
wd400 40gb hd
2.4.20-pre4-ac2 + RML preempt patch (applied cleanly)
boot it and eveything runs fine for a short while, then I start getting "bad 
CRC" errors and "seek failure" errors.
I have had this problem with both ext2 and ext3
initially I thought it was a bad HD, so I installed a new one on a new cable 
and did a complete rh7.3 install ran for a while eith no problems then built 
the same kernel over again, rebooted into the new kernel and within seconds 
was having problems again.
2.4.19-rc3-ac4 +rml preempt has been dead stable, as has (so far) 2.4.29-ac4 
+rml and RH 2.4.18-3 and -5
I am not doing anything funky with hd setup, not even specifying idebus= 
this has happened with 40 and 80 wire cables.
if there is any additional info I can provide please let me know.
