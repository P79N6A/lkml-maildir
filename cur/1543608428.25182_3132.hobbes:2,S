Subject: [PATCH] fix for cdput() race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Resend - that area hadn't changed and bug is still there.
Race between cdput() and cdget() - if we have the only reference to
char_device and call cdput() while somebody else does cdget() on
another CPU, we are going to hit a race:
cdget:
	grabs cdev_lock
	searches the lists
				cdput:
					decrements ->count to 0
					spins on attempt to get cdev_lock
	find the structure
	increments ->count
	drops cdev_lock
	returns pointer to found	acquires cdev_lock
					removes the structure from lists
					frees it
caller of cdget:
	dereferences the returned value
	oops
This is exactly the same scenario as we had in d_lookup()/dput() - one
that lead to introduction of atomic_dec_and_lock().  Fix is trivial.
Please, apply.
