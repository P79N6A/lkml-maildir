I have tried the r8169 driver on 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test9, and r8139cp on
2.4.20. On 2.4.22, it printed "too much work at interrupt" forever after
3-60 seconds of connection to a lan. I commented the printk out, that didnt
help though. The behaviour is exactly the same on 2.6.0-test9 and 2.4.20, a
few seconds after "ifconfig eth1 up" the machine hangs, though on 2.4.20
atleast there was no printk message seen. ifconfig shows it does receive and
send a few packets before it hangs, atleast on 2.4.22. The 8169 cards have
been confirmed to be working, but not on this particular motherboard though.
