I hate unions that have to do it this way.
Unions are imho only acceptable when they implicitly know their own type.
The in-kernel example of this is the inode per-filesystem thing. An inode
has a filesystem-specific part, and there is no way any other filesystem
can access it except by a major bug somewhere.
Any union that needs code like
	if (xxx->type == yyy)..
		....
is a design mistake.
I don't think you'll find all that many unions in Linux. And I don't think
we should add new ones..
