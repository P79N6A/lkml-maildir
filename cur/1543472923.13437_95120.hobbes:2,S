I've just downloaded 2.1.132 on this system, and am unpacking it at
the moment...ah, done. let's have a look...OK, try this...

I've changed the "Both" option to "Any" to make the options differ
from the first letter onwards, and the above appears to work for
"oldconfig", "config" and "menuconfig" - I can't test "xconfig" atm,
so can't comment on that...
Best wishes from Riley.
