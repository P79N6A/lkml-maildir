	This sounds like a bug that I posted a fix for a long time ago.
cramfs calls bforget on the superblock area, destroying that block of
the ramdisk, even when the ramdisk does not contain a cramfs file system.
Normally, bforget is called on block that really can be trashed,
such as blocks release by truncate or unlink.  If it worked for
you before, you were just getting lucky.  Here is the patch.
	Linus, please consider applying this.  Thank you.
	By the way, the other approach to fixing this problem would
be to change bforget not to trash blocks marked with BH_Protected
(I think that is just ramdisk blocks), but that would waste memory,
because we really can release blocks from things like truncating
or unlinking files.
