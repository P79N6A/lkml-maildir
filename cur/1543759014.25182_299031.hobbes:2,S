Then do away with -preX -rcY -bkZ altogether... just release 2.6.W. Faster
release cycle, much higher chance that "the next release" fixes brokenness
fast. The whole (or most of it) odd/even thinking went out the window with
the new development model.
[I'm pulling bk daily, and have it mixed with the ipw tree too, so I'm just
 the kind of tester you are looking for... haven't seen any of the
 showstopper bugs everybody is talking about, or I'd have screamed.]
