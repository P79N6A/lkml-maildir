Aurelien,
the device you're using is around 2 years old. You're one of the lucky
ones, I have tonns of support mails in my mail account from people who
own almost a similar device but with different videodecoders which are
not fully supported in the kernel or which worked and got broken
during the time.
It took me around 4 hours to debug such an issue last years remotly
with an enduser (which includes that noone cared to ask me if I'm fine
with such an update, neither did someone ask people who own such
devices that they should test the changes).
Please also take other devices and upcoming devices into account,
since i'm willing to spend that time and since I'm in contact with
various companies who provide several components of those devices.

this is what all is about, the project does not depend on certain
broken drivers anymore. And people who initially disagreed without
having any solution nor contributed any code can continue to play
their game without having an impact on that driver anymore.
