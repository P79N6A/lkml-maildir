Weak is generally the wrong thing for what we do in kernel land.  We don't
even want to build the generic version if we have a better one.  It also
makes it really hard to find out what exactly in use.  Linus only argued
against __ARCH_HAVE_FOO, but his suggested replacemenet is:
#ifndef foo
#define foo	generic_version
#endif
