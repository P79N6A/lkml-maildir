hello justin !
i have just tried to install the latest 2.4.3pre3 kernel with your
driver.
it failed with yacc: file not found.
while i could install yacc, i have never had to use it before. i was
assuming that the newer bison could do the same thing (which is what
i have installed).
so far, the kernel has not relied on yacc, which is why i'd like to
ask you if it's possible to make it work with bison.
sorry if this has been dealt with before, but i didn't find anything
in the lkml archive.
regards,
jörn
please keep me cc:ed, i'm not on lkml. thanks.
