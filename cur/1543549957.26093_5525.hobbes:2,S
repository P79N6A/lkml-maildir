Hi Abel,
at the bottom of each message there is a url to lkml FAQ - have you read
it? It should say (I haven't read it myself but it _should_, Richard you
hear this? :) plainly that Linux (or any UNIX) kernel development in C++
is a very bad idea and explain why. Because C++ is not yet a mature
programming language for tasks where precise knowledge of the generated
code is required (and probably will never be). Think of C programming (in
the kernel) simply as an assembly programming but using compiler as a
useful shortcut generator, instead of typing tedious (and most
importantly, arch-dependent!) sequences of instructions. Just a way to
save time, and still remain in total control of what the resulting code
will do and precisely how it will do it.
Regards,
Tigran
