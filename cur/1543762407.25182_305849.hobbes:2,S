Exactlty. I had to revert this one since 2.6.11-bk3, or starting X kills
the machine. By "kill", I mean the real thing, black screen, dead
network, reset is the only choice. This is a (surprise!) VIA-based
motherboard (Asus A7V133-C) with Radeon 9200-based graphics adapter.
Dave Airlie was asking for a tester with such a configuration. I can
test whatever you want. Just tell me what we are looking for :)
With the patch above reverted, 2.6.12-rc1-mm2 seems to work just fine
for me. glxgears is OK and I just had a game of UT (first of the name).
However, I am not a regular gamer so I'm not sure what to look for.
Thanks,
