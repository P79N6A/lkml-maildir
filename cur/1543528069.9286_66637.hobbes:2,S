So the amount of data is quite small ?

You have two cases then
1.	You are the compiled in root file system driver. In which case only
	boot up options from the command line (or lilo added) will work
	since the rootfs cant be mounted until you are running
2.	You pass the target id as a module parameter with insmod and use
	the value in the driver. 
Presumably an application would be needed after loading that queried the
driver to see if the target id changed ?
