Those symbols are defined in drivers/sound/aci.c but are not exported
for other modules to use.  The aci and miropcm20 code needs to be
changed to support use as modules.  Also the config.in files need
fixing for these files, it is possible to select combinations of aci
and miropcm20 that will fail to link (miropcm20 built in, aci not
selected or selected as a module) or fail to load (miropcm20 selected
as a module, aci not selected).
