Sure, just a bit safer.

Well, the most obvious reason is that there is a unique state in the program 
that you wish to preserve. A possibly pathological scenario is this:
You have a machine controlling a physical process, say a robotic crane. It's 
currently holding up a big piece of work, and moving it the wrong way would be 
very bad.
You have just discovered that the movement routine fails to take some physical 
circumstance into account. If you could replace the routine in situ, there's 
no serious loss. However, stopping and restart the program is no good, because 
it automatically homes the crane, and more importantly, can't restart a 
movement routine in the middle.
A design failure? Sure, but a realistic scenario.
