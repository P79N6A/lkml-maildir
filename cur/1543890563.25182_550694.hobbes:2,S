Yes this is also what I assume happening. i.e. more likely a USB 
flash disk firmware bug than a controller bug (there are lots of 
crappy USB flash drives out there).

The specific use case I refer to is with a flash drive embedded 
inside a locked and closed chassis of a dedicated server. So, 
anyone repluging it must know what they are doing anyway.
