Subject: [PATCH]: reiser4 [1/8] export fsync_super()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, Linus,
    Following patch exports fsync_super() function. fsync_super() is
    required for reiser4, because during umount we want to perform some
    tasks after ->writepage has been called on all pages dirtied through
    mmap (that is, after fsync_super()), but before inodes
    destruction. As a result, reiser4 cannot use kill_block_super() and
    has to call fsync_super() explicitly.
Please apply.
Nikita.
