Never send patches during or approaching hangover?
	* it's on a bunch of cyclic lists.  Have its neighbor
go away while you are doing all that crap => boom
	* there's that thing call current position...  It gets buggered.
	* overwriting it while another task might be in the middle of
syscall involving it => boom
	* non-cooperative tasks reading *in* *parallel* from the same
opened file are going to have a lot more serious problems than agreeing
on O_NONBLOCK anyway, so I really don't understand what the hell is that for.
