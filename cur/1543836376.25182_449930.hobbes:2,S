Ted please make sure the tg3 chips you have actually do need
that periodic poking code that tg3_timer() has, most chips do
not.
You don't need the periodic poke unless TG3_FLAG_TAGGED_STATUS is
cleared, and that is only the case for two chips 1) 5700 and 2) 5788.
The only thing left is the link status and that is not so concerned
about mild forms of latency in the timer firing.
