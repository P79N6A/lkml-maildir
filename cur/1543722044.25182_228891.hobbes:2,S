No it won't.
You always need to figure out $(objtree) to build external modules, with or 
without a separate output directory. Many modules don't need to know 
$(srctree) explicitly at all.
In case you want to do something depending on the sources/confguration, there 
are two ways:
  - follow the new source symlink,
  - let kbuild take you to $(srctree): When the makefile in the M directory
    is included, the current working directory is $(srctree). besides, all the
    usual variables like $(srctree), $(objtree), CONFIG_* variables, etc. are
    all available. That's a good time to check for features, etc.

That's a misconception. At the minimum, you want to be able to build the 
module. Directly messing with the sources is usually wrong. I know external 
module authors like to do that nevertheless; in a few cases it's actually 
useful. Most of the time it really is not. Most external modules have totally 
braindead/broken makefiles.
