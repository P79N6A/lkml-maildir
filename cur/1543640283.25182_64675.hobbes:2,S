Actually, the intel manual recommends (but doesn't require) a wierd alignment 
for the descriptors.  It recommends aligning them at an address which is 2 MOD 
4 to avoid possible alignment check faults in user mode.  Not that I think we 
can ever run into the problem, but we should probably obey the recommendation. 
 I'll fix this up as well.
