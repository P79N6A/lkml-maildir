It does not unforch.

Apparently not in the rpm, darnit.

I'm going up to Clarksburg this afternoon to see if I can find a couple of 
drives, one a 2.5" bigger than 40Gb for my 2.5" maxtor usb housing, and 
another pata drive big enough to run this thing & just re-install the 
December respin after I save as much of this as I can, there's nearly 50GB 
here now.
Maybe it won't be so fscking picky about the next drive.
I was hoping someone could look at that last dmseg I attached, but apparently 
everybody is blinded by unrelated details as that bad sector may have been 
transient, caused by the multiple hardware reset type reboots so far today :(
The last 3 reboots have interrupted a 'smartctl -t long /dev/sda' in 
progress. :(
If I reconvert to non libata, can I do that only for the pata drives of which 
there are 3 here including the dvd writer, and still use libata for the lone 
sata drive left?
And can I do that without mucking with the device map, which will make 
amanda/tar attempt to do a level 0 on the whole system if its changed.  I see 
the drives are at 254 again, when are they going to be given a stable device 
address out of the LANANA experimental group so we can reboot without mucking 
with that and driving tar crazy?
Thanks everybody.
