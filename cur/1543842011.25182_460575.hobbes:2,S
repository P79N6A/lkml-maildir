hum hum, "Vladimir B. Savkin" report on Asus A8V (kernel 2.6.14+) 
and Heikki Orsila talks about is ASUS K8V SE Deluxe on amd64 with SiI
3114 SATA controller. 
yes, when Heikki Orsila reports a positive test, I thought was talking
about "Vladimir B. Savkin" reports. 
Is petty that "Vladimir B. Savkin" don't response.
and Heikki Orsila don't show his dmesg :) 
thanks,
