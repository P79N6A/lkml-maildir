If you only add parameters, why not use a struct with a length field? 
That can encode version information implicitly; You can assume 
everything beyond the length is not present in that ABI version.  If the 
interface is based on read(2), then you don't even need the length field 
in the structure, since everything can be handled by userspace 
specifying the length it wants as the read size parameter, and the 
kernel returning only the bytes for the fields it knows about.
