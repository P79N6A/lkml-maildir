WRITE_ACL is more like the VAX/VMS ACLs - which is where I believe NT got its
model from anyway.
So with DELETE you allow a corrupted directory to be created?
Or is that considered normal to have file names but no file? If I can
delete a file and remove it from the directory entry then I do have write
permission.

I do seem to remember some discussion about more being included (things
like APPEND and EDIT_ACL permissions), but I didn't realize they never made it.
