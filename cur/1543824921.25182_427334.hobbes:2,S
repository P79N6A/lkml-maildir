Linux-VServer uses a token bucket scheduler (TBS) to limit cpu ressources
for processes in a "context". All processes in a context share one token
bucket, which has a set of parameters to tune scheduling behaviour.
As the token bucket is shared by a group of processes, and inherited by
child processes/threads, management is quite easy. And the parameters
can be tuned to allow different scheduling behaviours, like allowing a
process group to burst, ie. use as much cpu time as is available, after
being idle for some time, but being limited to X % cpu time on average.
I'm CC'ing Herbert and Sam on this as they can explain the whole thing a
lot better and I'm not familiar with implementation details.
