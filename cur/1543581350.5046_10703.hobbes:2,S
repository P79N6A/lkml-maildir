  In current kernel there's no constant specifying quota
blocksize and BLOCK_SIZE is hardcoded into the quota code
so it's fairly reasonable to use that constant for utils...
  (In my patches for new quota format this issue is also
addressed and constant QUOTABLOCK_SIZE is defined).
  I don't know if you know that there's been created
SourceForge project for linux quota utils (project has description
'Linux DiskQuota' and has name 'linuxquota'). If you're
interested you might include your utility to standard
quota utils package (there's setquota utility which should be
command line tool in the package so we might drop setquota
if your util is better :)) BTW: What does your util better
than setquota?)
