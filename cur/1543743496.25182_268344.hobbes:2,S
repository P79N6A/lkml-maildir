That's what I just said, the original poster should tell us what the 
PPID is, which may help someone help the OP.

Actually the ones in i/o probably won't, since the kernel either missed 
the completion or didn't time out if the hardware missed sending the 
int. And even plain non-i/o zombies, just how long "a bit" are you 
proposing?
Over Thanksgiving weekend I will try to look at the init code and see if 
a signal could be used to initiate a forced reap without waiting for the 
timer. By "look at" I mean not only "could I do that" but is it a good 
thing to do, before someone starts trying to explain that it's going to 
do something evil not to wait for the timer...
