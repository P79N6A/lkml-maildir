Yes.  The safest approach will be to check whether the device is still 
at the end of the dpm_locked or dpm_off list; if it hasn't then we can 
assume that it has been removed (or scheduled for removal).

Actually I changed the last two lines to:
+
+		/* Don't move the entry if the device has been unregistered */
+		if (entry == dpm_off.prev)
+			list_move(entry, &dpm_off_irq);
with analogous changes to dpm_suspend().
Any more suggestions for updates?
