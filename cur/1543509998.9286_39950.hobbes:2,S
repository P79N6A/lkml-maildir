I don't like the kmalloc in array.c to copy the task struct. Not strictly
for performances but because we should do the proper locking there.
The current fixes in 2.3.18ac6 broken again wchan. This patch will make
wchan working again in the current kmalloc/memcpy way. Also it seems to me
that KSTCK_* are looking larger than sizeof(struct task_struct).
