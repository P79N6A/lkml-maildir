Patches are welcome, I guess :)

Where are sleep() and sleep_interruptible() defined? And this basically
pushes down the identical implementation a layer, correct? Finally, you
cannot simply do msecs_to_jiffies() in the caller of
sleep{,_interruptible()}, unless sleep{,_interruptible()} add 1 to every
request themselves. The basic issue is that with jiffies and ticks being
identical, there is no concept of the inter-tick position (i.e., a
sub-jiffy value), and the callers of these conversion functions *must*
assume they are going to be added to the timer subsystem immediately
before a timer interrupt occurs. An entire tick has not elapsed, but if
the caller had not added 1, then we could potentially go off almost an
entire tick early. The +1 is basically specifying we are asking to add
our delay to the *next* tick.

I agree that from an internal perspective there is no difference, but
from an *interface* perspective they are hugely different, simply on the
basis that one uses human-time units and one does not.
I guess we must continue to agree to disagree.
I am still waiting for some feedback from Andrew if he would prefer a
jiffy-only version or both the jiffy and msec version.
Thanks,
