People (that I know of) don't normally have a huge lot of hardlinks to a
single file.

If the DFS is quick, it shouldn't make much difference.
Lock nodes as you walk up the tree, and people can change unlocked nodes
without harming anything.  All you need to do is make sure that no up
pointers get added to nodes that you've already looked at.
People can also still edit files without changing the tree (and hence
not screwing up the DFS).

What does deleting have to do with up pointers?  If you delete a
directory that has refcount greater than 1, you decrease the refcount,
remove the appropriate up pointer, and remove the inode entry from its
parent.  If you delete a directory that has refcount equal to 1, well,
we're in the same situation we're in right now when you delete a
directory; you need to "rm -r", which doesn't lock up the whole
filesystem.
