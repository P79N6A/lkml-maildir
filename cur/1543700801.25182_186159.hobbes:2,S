I get failures with hotplug on SuSE 9.0 and found out it is expecting 
/proc/bus/usb/drivers/ to exist. Modding /etc/hotplug/usb.rc to point to 
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/ does not fix it.
Downloaded and built hotplug-2003_08_05.tar.gz (latest I could find), 
but the file looks just the same and I'm getting "hotplug: can't 
synthesize events" messages.
Is there a 2.6.0 hotplug to be had?
Regards
Sid.
