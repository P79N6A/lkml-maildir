Hi Tim.

As per my previous post on the subject, some months ago...
Case 1: make dep clean zImage modules
    It will SOMETIMES get down to the stage where it's about to
    combine everything into the final kernel, then will splurge out
    tons of "undefined symbol" errors for totally invalid symbols,
    with names such as j`#@;^% and the like - and no, I'm not
    joking!!! No kernel image to test out at all...
    Occasionally, it will appear to compile fine, but the resulting
    kernel image will not boot...
    It will normally compile fine, and the resulting kernel image will
    boot, but the resulting kernel tends to be prone to kernel
    panics...
Case 2: make dep clean modules zImage
    It will ALWAYS compile fine, and give me a bootable kernel image,
    and I rarely see any kernel panics either...
Note that the presence or absence of modules_install does not affect
the behaviour, and also that such has happenned on FOUR DIFFERENT
systems; a 386dx/33+387, a 486sx/25 (no 487), a 486dx2/50 and a P166,
so it isn't processor specific...
Also note that I don't have the foggiest what is causing it, and my
browsing the Makefiles suggests that it shouldn't make the sligghtest
difference which way round those two op[tions are specified, but it
does.
If anybody can explain it, please do !!!
Finally, substituting bzImage for zImage hasn't yet produced the wads
of "undefined symbols", but it HAS produced a kernel image that won't
boot, and simply using the "Case 2" order replaced that with one that
did boot...
Best wishes from Riley.
