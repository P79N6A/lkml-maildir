IMHO that is a rather sick way of doing it.  By doing such a change:
1. you immediately force everyone to use an initial ramdisk,
   which requires the ramdisk code (which increases the kernel size
   by about 16KB), plus the extra effort to get the initial
   ramdisk into memory.
   Not everyone uses or wants to use initial ramdisks.
2. you reduce the kernel size by around 6-14KB by removing the
   partition code.
I believe that your original argument for doing the change was to
decrease the size of the running kernel, and increase the loading
time by a couple of milliseconds?  (please correct if this is wrong).
What has actually happened is that you have increased the loading time
by considerably more than a couple of milliseconds due to having to load
an initial ramdisk, and you have increased the size of the running kernel
by 2KB, or half a page.
I don't see that there is any gain here, sorry.
