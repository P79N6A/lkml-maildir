Hi all,
I'd like to know which binary program has been used to launch the current
task.
I used to find it in the current->mm->mmap->vm_file->f_dentry structure.
(device, inode and short name of the binary prog.)
It happens that with the non-executable stack feature of solar's Openwall
(www.openwall.com) this behaviour isn't possible anymore. Indeed, vm_file
becomes wrong or NULL (it stays right if the executable flag is set for
the process, ie vm_file is wrong only for tasks whose stack is protected)
So my questions are :
-What is current->mm->mmap->vm_file ?
-Is my method for accessing these infos right ?
-What would be the right method to get device/inode/name of the binary of
a task ?
regards, Phil.
