Yep.  And Intel added a bunch of them to their compiler so that they 
could build a kernel with it.

The Intel compiler is quite good at optimizing for their processors (and 
ironically for AMD ones as well).  However, I think that a lot of the 
gains come from the vectorizer, which of course can't be used with 
kernel code.
