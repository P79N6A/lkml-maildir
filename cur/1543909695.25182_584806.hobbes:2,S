Wouldn't the above "forget" the value, throw it away, then forget
that it forgot it, giving non-volatile semantics?

Given that you are advocating a change (please keep in mind that
atomic_read() and atomic_set() had volatile semantics on almost all
platforms), care to give some example where these historical volatile
semantics are causing a problem?

Do we really need another set of APIs?  Can you give even one example
where the pre-existing volatile semantics are causing enough of a problem
to justify adding yet more atomic_*() APIs?
