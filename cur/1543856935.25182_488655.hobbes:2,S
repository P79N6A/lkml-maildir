I'm trying to upgrade to kernel 1.6.19.
The boot process immediatly locks in a loop with the message:
"atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly."
The box is running fine with kernel 1.6.18.4.
It's an iDEQ200V box with a BioStar motherboar, VIA KM400 + VT8237 chipset.
Here's my BIOS information based on dmidecode:
