Hrm.. either you handle it or you are dead ... I fail to see how
signalfd can sneak in to catch it just at the right time...

Well, a synchronous signal such a SIGSEGV, SIGILL or SIGFPE generally
means that execution cannot continue unless the signal handler does
something about it...
I think you are opening a whole can of worms here.

Well, because the kernel makes the decision of which thread to target
the signal for a shared signal at emission time (though it -can- be
caught by another thread).
/me reads more code to be sure..
Oh well, a read from signalfd created on one thread -will- catch any
shared signal that was already pending, whatever thread the kernel
decided to target it at, it seems (that is, whatever thread actually got
TIF_SIGPENDING set), but will only catch private signals for _that_
thread (and I still think catching private signals is a wrong thing).
However, I'm not sure about the wakeup condition. signalfd_deliver will
wakeup anybody in the signalfd_list, which is -not- whoever is blocked
in signalfd_read() unless I'm missing something.
For your scheme to work, signalfd_read() you probably need to keep a
separate list of people to be nofified of signals and add current to it
from signalfd_list().
Ben.
