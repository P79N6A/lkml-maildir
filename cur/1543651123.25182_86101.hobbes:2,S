I see this as a "vendor, RPM maintainer, developer" thing. The
developer,vendor,RPM mainter should be able to determine exactly what
capabilities an otherwise SUID root app needs and ship it appropriately.
Most sysadmin can't 'deal with X', where X is:
- Setup routing properly
- Configure kerberos
- Compile a kernel
- Use setfactl
- ext2/3 attributes
- IPTables
- SGID directories
- Apply a patch
That doesn't mean we should remove the above because they can be used
incorrectly/inappropriately and possibly damage and/or insecure a
system.
