Currently implemented in-tree drivers(hw_random.c, do not have spec
about 
VIA) do not perform any kind of validation, drivers created for
OCF/acrypto
have HW validated RNG.
Such hardware is used mostly in embedded world where SW crypto
processing
is too expensive, so users of such HW likely want to trust to 
theirs hardware and likely will turn in on.
That would be even be a good idea to have two way of turning it on - 
kernel config option and ioctl() one - to allow embedded systems
with too limited userspace not change it's applications.
Of course with big fat warning about possible dramatical consequences.
