No, it's on-topic.
(1) The issue is not theoretical. e.g. sysrq t does trigger NMI oopses,
	merely not every time, and not on every system. It is not
	associated with hardware failure. It is, however, tolerable
	because sysrq's require privilege to trigger and are primarly
	used when the box is dying anyway.
(2) NMI's don't nest. There is no possibility of NMI's racing against
	themselves while the data is per-cpu.

They are causing problems. They never stopped causing problems. None
of the above attempts to reduce rwlock starvation has been successful
in reducing it to untriggerable-in-the-field levels, and empirical
demonstrations of starvation recurring after those available at the
time of testing were put into place did in fact happen. Reduction of
frequency and making starvation more difficult to trigger are all that
they've achieved thus far.

There is and has always been. All of the above merely mitigate the
issue, with the possible exception of the tasklist RCU patch, for
which I know of no testing results. Also note that almost none of
the work on /proc/ has been merged.

You are aggravating the rwlock starvation by introducing gratuitous
full tasklist iterations. There is no solution to do_task_stat()
because it was recently introduced. There will be one as part of a port
of the usual mitigation patches when the perennial problem is reported
against a sufficiently recent kernel version, as usual. The already-
demonstrated problematic iterations have not been removed.
