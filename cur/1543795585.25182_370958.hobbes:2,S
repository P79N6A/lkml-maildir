Yes, but there seems to be an awfully large number of affected models 
(at least the nc4200, tc4200, nx6110, nc6120, nc6220, nc6230, nc8220, 
nc8230 and nw8240) and HP and myself couldn't figure out /why/ they 
won't reboot in the normal way, so there's a fairly good chance that the 
next generation of them will have the same problem.
It's actually a bit odd. If I write some userspace code to prod the 
keyboard controller in the same way as the kernel reboot code does, the 
system reboots. If the kernel does it, it freezes at the point where it 
pokes the keyboard controller.
