Hi , I reconnected and rebooted with the kernel option 
"acpi_use_timer_override" (this is the correct spelling, isn't it? - 
Kernel didn't complain.). Didn't help, the same error received as 
before. - I'll have to connect all disks back to my PCI-connected SATA 
controllers and start rebuilding my RAID yet again.
It seems random which disk is first affected (This far, I know that it 
has happened to ata1, ata3 and ata4, three of my potential disks) - I 
guess it just happens to the disk that is being used at the moment when 
the driver / controller acts up.)
I'm about to give in. I think I'll try to replace both ( Gigabyte 
GA-N650SLI-DS4 ) motherboards, as the driver simply isn't working for 
the on-board controller of these boards. Could be a combination of the 
controllers and some other HW on the motherboards of course, but all is 
working when I connect all disks to my non-nvidia controllers. - Guess 
I'll opt for a motherboard with an intel-chipset after all...
