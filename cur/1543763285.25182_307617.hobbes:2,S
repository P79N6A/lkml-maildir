well it's not a big problem, and we avoided having to add flags to the 
rt_lock structure, which is the important issue.
your patch looks good, i've added it to my tree and have uploaded the 
-26-00 patch. It boots fine on my testbox, except for some new messages:

this goes away if i revert your patch. It seems the reason is that 
trylock hasnt been updated to use the pending-owner logic?
