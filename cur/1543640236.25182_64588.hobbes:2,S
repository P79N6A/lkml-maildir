Hi everyone,
I have a problem with the aic7xxx constantly retrying to initialize my 
LVD SCSI drives.  I'm repeatedly getting a "Command already completed" 
message.  It was mentioned to me that this might be an interrupt related 
problem (thank you Justin!).
My board has a Intel 440GX chipset.  From my understanding these are a 
bitch to deal with and are littered with bugs.  I've also read that by 
enabling SMP or IO-APIC, it should solve this issue.  Well, neither does 
it for me.
Does anyone know what could have changed between .18 and .19 that would 
cause something like this to happen?
Any insight would be appreciated!
Thanks,
-reid
