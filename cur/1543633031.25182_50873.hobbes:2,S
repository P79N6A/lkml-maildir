OK.  What I'll do is:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#define NR_CPUS CONFIG_NR_CPUS
#else
#define NR_CPUS 1
#endif
and then go edit every SMP-capable arch's config.in/Config.help
files.  But the arch maintainers should test one case please - x86
was locking up at boot on quad CPU with NR_CPUS=2.  Others may do
the same.
About a quarter of the bloat is runqueues.  If we could dynamically
allocate those in sched_init() it would be good, because presumably
vendor kernels will be configured for the maximum number of CPUs.
