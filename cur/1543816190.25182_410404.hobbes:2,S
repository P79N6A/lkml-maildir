audit, inotify

but this mechanism doesn't actually cover the virus scanner need at
least; audit is a bit more complex in code because it's a security tool
and needs to be accurate for security-related events. Now guess what...
a virus scanner needs this same level of scrutiny... (well unless you
don't care about that it's easy to bypass your scanner and that you
support linux only for marketing reasons ;)
