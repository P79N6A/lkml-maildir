Hi,
I am not able to compile the driver tmscsim.c
for my Tekram DC-390 adapter. It seems that
some porting from the 2.4.x kernels has to
be done (see scsiiom.c and Documentation/DMA
-mapping.txt). Is there someone working    
on that?      
If not, are there some good starting
points to do it myself?
Constantin
