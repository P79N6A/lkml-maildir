Hi again
Just a bit more detail to the way the bug occurs: you just need
CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
and in my case I had 2 consoles: tty1 and ttyS0. tty1 is a framebuffer. I 
don't know where irqs get disabled (the original BUG was
BUG: scheduling with irqs disabled: posix_cpu_timer/0x00000001/2
caller is rt_spin_lock_slowlock+0xd8/0x1c8
but is it at all ok to schedule in kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)? Which is exactly 
what happens here as kmalloc tries to acquire the per-cpu "spinlock" / 
mutex slab_irq_locks and is forced into the slow path.
The bug often triggers when I reset /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency 
with 0 and if I have high enough console logging level in 
/proc/sys/kernel/printk.
Thanks
Guennadi
