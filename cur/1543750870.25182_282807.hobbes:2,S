The load and the CPU useage are two separate things:
Load: Defined by a programmer on an estimate on which his program is running 
100% fulltime, thus consuming little or more CPU/IO.
The interesting program you mention is the VoIP application. Is this program 
multithreaded and is every thread using a little bit of CPU? Than it quickly 
adds up to the mentioned 40%. The load is than also easily reached.
