 Huh?  You can use CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN.  Gcc and the linker for
MIPS/Linux typically support both endiannesses (with a default selected at
their build time) and it's the configuration variable that selects either
of them.

 CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN is available to Makefiles.  There used to be
separate linker scripts for different endiannesses for MIPS once.
