In general, when you unmount a filesystem, the system caches and data 
relevant for that filesystem are flushed to the disk. So if the first one 
leaves withou unmounting his disk, he can even have a corrupted fs himself, 
because some data didn't make it to the drive yet, there are just in caches. 
When a second user comes and unmounts a disk, then the data are flushed (the 
old data) and he gets a fs corruption, because the data were not from his 
disk. 
It is just matter of luck and it depends a lot on the buffering approach 
chosen by the fs developers - ext2 tends to cache a lot of things to improve 
performance and the disk flushes are not that frequent. If you manage to plug 
your drive in a wrong moment, then you end up with a mess. You can easily 
test this problem with floppies.
So, the solution is - teach your users to unmount disks before leaving, or 
mount them in synchronous mode - but I am not sure, whether VFAT supports 
that and it is a performance hog too.
