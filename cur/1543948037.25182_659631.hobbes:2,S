This patch causes a large and nasty reject.

Probably because you patched 2.6.24.  We're developing 2.6.25 now, and the
difference between the two is very large inded.  Please raise patches
against Linus's latest tree?
There are other patches pending against printk.c (in -mm and in git-sched)
but afacit they won't collide.

Please do

I find that the best-value comments one can add to kernel code are to the
members of structures.  If the reader understands what all the fields do, the
code becomes simple to follow.

I don't get it.  There's one instance of limit_state, kernel-wide, and
__printk_ratelimit() modifies it.  What prevents one CPU's activities from
interfering with a second CPU's activities?
