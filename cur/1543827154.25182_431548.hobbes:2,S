If your files are under 2GB long, you've not used any attributes,
SELinux labels or various other things maybe. In the practical real
world case it isn't. I doubt many Fedora/Red Hat users have a single FS
from RHEL4/FC1 onwards that is readable by 2.2 ext3 (or most 2.4 ext3)
OTOH the number of complaints about this is minimal, people want to go
forwards in a controlled manner not backwards.
