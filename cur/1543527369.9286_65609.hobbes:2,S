It's EACCES :-) Note that it (*) says for EINVAL and ERANGE: "If any of
the following conditions occur, [...]". Considering that 2.4, paragraph
says an implementation may _not_ detect certain conditions, this seems
to imply that an implementation is allowed not to check for EACCES.
So this looks good.
