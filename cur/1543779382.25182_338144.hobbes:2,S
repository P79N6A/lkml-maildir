Tested with the 3com 3c556B Hurricane mini-PCI card in the IBM A21P.  Without
this patch the 3c59x driver has not been able to read the MAC address of
the card's EEPROM with ACPI enabled, now it works with and without ACPI
support.  This patch should settle at least some of the issues in
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188.
