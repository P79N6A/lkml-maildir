Stephane,
This patch has the same race as in 64 bit patch, that was fixed here
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0611.3/1264.html
With that race, idle callbacks does not work correctly. Even on a
totally idle system, I can see exit_idle called before enter_idle once
every few seconds. Can you update this patch with similar changes as in
64 bit part in the above patch.
Thanks,
Venki
