Not if the driver has a decent irq mitigation schema and uses the 
hw flow control + NAPI bits.

Frankly I'm sick of this entire discussion where people claim that no 
form of interrupt throttling is ever needed.  It's an emergency measure 
that is needed under some circumstances as very few drivers properly 
protect against this kind of DoS.  Drivers that do things correctly will 
never trigger the hammer.  Plus it's configurable.  If you'd bothered to 
read and understand the rest of this thread you wouldn't have posted.
