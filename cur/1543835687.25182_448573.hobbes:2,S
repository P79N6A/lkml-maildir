So there's been a change from the "new drivers can be merged late"
policy?  News to me if so.  Not that this is a particularly new
driver of course, or at all unstable.

Review it again?  I'll try to make some time to help there, but
it's unlikely I'll notice significant issues that seem to me
worth holding up the upstream merge.  Certainly none that make
up for the problems caused by having the kernel.org tree be all
but unusable for OMAP work, and couldn't be patched later.

Not "my" driver at all; I'm not even on the copyright list, and
maybe the biggest change I did was the platform_driver conversion.
(If that; I don't recall, but I converted a lot of drivers around
that time and I think I probably did that one too.)

Evolution.  I see support for the new OMAP2 parts (ARMv6) and maybe
the clock framework stuff is new; plus as you know the I2C framework
has collected simplifications and updates.
