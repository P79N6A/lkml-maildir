Greetings;
Someone suggested a fresh thread for this.
I now have my scripts more or less under control, and I can report that 
kernel-2.6.20.1 with no other patches does not exhibit the undesirable 
behaviour where tar thinks its all new, even when told to do a level 2 on 
a directory tree that hasn't been touched in months to update anything.
Next up, 2.6.20.2, plain and with the latest RDSL-0.30 patch.

Cheers, Gene
