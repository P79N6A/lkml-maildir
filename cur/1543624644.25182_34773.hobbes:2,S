Few modules take an interest in ptes, that's as it should be, and so
few modules build to different binaries with CONFIX_X86_PAE off or on
(modulo module versions).  I love vmalloc_to_page because it takes pte
dependence out of a group of modules which really had no interest in
ptes in the first place.  Less false grep hits when searching the tree!
