I already digested it, I just don't know the answer. I'm not familiar
with this part of the kernel, nor exactly what the patch is doing - just
the broad strokes.

The permissions problem is a kernel bug which should be fixed. I have no
thoughts on the other changes in the patch, I didn't ask for them and
don't really know what they do.

Thanks, but I'll leave this in Johns hands. I just wanted to let you
guys know that it's no longer a major problem for us as it was before,
so if you have higher priorities don't worry about Wine.
