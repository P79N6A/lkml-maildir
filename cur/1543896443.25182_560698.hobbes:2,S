Okay, so what I see in your patches are:

Other than cosmetic, I don't see anything terribly wrong with this,
although getting a flag when the directory is overmounted would be nice.
I guess I suggest a single comma-separated field with flags and optional
":argument":
	private
	shared:<peer>
	slave:<master>
	unbindable
	overmounted
So we could end up with something like:
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0 0:1 / 1 private,overmounted
... where 1 is the mnt_id (sequence number).
[Please see my other comments in this thread... basically I believe we
should just add fields to /proc/mounts.]
