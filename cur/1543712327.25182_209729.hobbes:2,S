It could be relevant so that you can access the resume data only on the
same computer so that access to encrypted partitions couldn't be gained
by looking at the suspend data, but I don't know how encrypted
partitions work, so can't say anything about that.

If the key is given at resume command line and this is properly
forgotten when the resumed kernel kicks in then a user key will also
probably be ok.
It wouldn't do much good getting a safer method then the way the
encrypted partition works in the first place.
I think the difference would be user convenience more then security.
