shrink_mmap() should never be able to call kpiod.  The source also
includes this commented fragment:
static inline void make_pio_request(struct file *file,
				    unsigned long offset,
				    unsigned long page)
{
	struct pio_request *p;
	atomic_inc(&mem_map[MAP_NR(page)].count);
	/* 
	 * We need to allocate without causing any recursive IO in the
	 * current thread's context.  We might currently be swapping out

	 * filesystem lock.  To avoid deadlock, we *MUST* not reenter
	 * the filesystem in this thread.
	 *
	 * We can wait for kswapd to free memory, or we can try to free
	 * pages without actually performing further IO, without fear of
	 * deadlock.  --sct
	 */
This applies to swapouts made by kpiod itself, and that is quite
deliberate.  If, in the process of performing its IO, kpiod calls
try_to_free_page and ends up back in filemap_write_page, the result will
just be another pio requests added to the queue: there will be _no_
recursive IO, and no recursive entering of the kpiod loop.

Could you please try?  The design of kpiod already takes that recursion
into account and _does_ avoid it.

We regularly have 5000 or more dirty buffers on the locked queue
awaiting IO when doing intensive sequential writes() to a file.  I don't
think that the pio request queue is even remotely significant from this
point of view!

That will just end up forcing huge numbers of extra, unnecessary context
switches, reducing performance further.  ...

Ah, so the sched_yield is keyed on a maximum pio request size.  Fine, I
can live with that, and I'll assemble the patch agains 2.2.2-pre2 for
Linus.
However, I really would appreciate it if you could double-check your
concerns about the recursive behaviour of kpiod.  That should be
completely impossible due to the kpiod design, so any problems there
must be due to some other interaction between the vm components.
