fchmod() came into play with socketpair() to get the fd modes to match
pipe(); its not needed with pipe()
we use socketpair() to allow efficient peeking on pipe input (via recv()),
where peek means "read some data but don't advance the read/seek offset"
btw, this is on systems that don't allow ioctl(I_PEEK) on pipe() fds;
if there is a way to peek pipe() data on linux then we can switch back
to pipe() and be on our way

named sockets seem a little heavyweight for this application
