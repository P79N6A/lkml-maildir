Right, I don't want too much in there.  There are a few things I need to
do when I know nobody else is messing with the inode, and I'm using
i_sem to provide that now.  put_inode doesn't do what I need because
knfsd might iget his way into the mess.
I'm talking a very limited set of operations followed by calling the
generic functions.  I might not do it at all if I can't get them safe
when called under the spin lock.
