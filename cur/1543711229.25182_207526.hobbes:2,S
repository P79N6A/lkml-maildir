I have a different issue with setting cpu affinity.  Has anyone 
considered a "soft" affinity?
I'm thinking of the case where I want to run processes on separate cpus 
for performance reasons, but in the case that one cpu becomes 
unavailable (physically removed, hardware fault, etc.) I would like to 
move those processes back to working cpus (except for maybe the one that 
was actually running and therefore might be corrupted).  In this case a 
reduced performance might be preferable to an unplanned failover to 
backup hardware.
Has this scenario been considered, or will cpu affinity be a "hard" setting.
