Hmmm... I don't want to tell you how you have to do your job, but this 
is a known error and (if I followed the postings here correctly) there 
was a fix posted. So why not include it in 2.4.22?
imho the patch have to be included in 2.4.21 and (imho) it is a bad 
practice to release a piece of software with a known bug (especially 
if a fix is available).
Bye
