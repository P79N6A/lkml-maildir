I looked at this a little more.  It seems that the test-tcq.pl that I
downloaded did not have the bit-shift operators correct.  I don't know how
that happened, but it caused it to report incorrectly the TCQ support for
my drives.
After looking at the bits in the "drive features supported" and comparing 
against the spec, neither drive supports TCQ.  The test-tcq.pl script with 
the correct bit-shift operators also shows that neither drive supports 
TCQ.
So, I guess you can ignore my previous message...
