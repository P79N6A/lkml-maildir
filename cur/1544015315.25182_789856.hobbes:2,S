  Got it now, however the issue doesn't seem as evident simple to me...

   Correctly indeed? I'm not at all sure it's correct to read an extra 
16-bit word off the device when it thinks it's already done with the 
data transfer. This is not the same as to read 16-bit word and ignore 
its MSB as it happened. The same concern about the writes... Note that 
the IDE code doesn't do this...
