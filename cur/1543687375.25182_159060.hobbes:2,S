I have made three patches that makes up the leon/sparc port
for linux-2.5.75:
* linux-2.5.75_kernel_only.diff  - leon support in kernel
* linux-2.5.75_open_eth.diff     - opencores ethernet driver
* linux-2.5.75_leon_uart.diff    - leon uart driver
The total size is about 150 Kbyte, so to avoid a large email
the patches can be downloaded from:

I don't have Russell King's email address, maybe you could
forward this mail to him?

Yes, this was a virtual address aliasing problem. Leon2 has
virtual caches but the MMU has no aliasing detection, so we
are forced to flush the cache on each task switch. Our next
processor (leon3) will have to switch to either physical caches
or have some form of aliasing detection ...
Regards, Jiri.
