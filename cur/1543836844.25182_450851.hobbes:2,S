Hmmm, this sounds like a bug somewhere. TRM for 5912 says the I2C clock
must be prescaled to be between 7 - 12 MHz [1]. The XOR input clock is
typically 12, 13 or 19.2 MHz. So we should have code that produces:
XOR Mhz	Divider	Prescaler
12	1	0
13	2	1
19.2	2	1
Then again the original old code produces something different too [2]...
I suspect the original code had some hw workarounds and and later code
may have a conversion bug somewhere :)
I suggest we keep the code as is for now since it's known to work on
all omaps, and then submit a follow-up patch later once we have
verified that that code based on the TRM works on all omaps.
Regards,
Tony
