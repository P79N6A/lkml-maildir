Adrian's point is that gcc without -ffreestanding may decide to implement
log2() itself by issuing the appropriate floating point instructions
rather than using a function call into a library to do this operation.
Therefore, re-using "log2()" is about as bad as re-using the "strcmp()"
name to implement a function which copies strings.
And, sure enough, try throwing this at a compiler:
int log2(int foo)
{
	return foo;
}
you get:
t.c:2: warning: conflicting types for built-in function 'log2'
but not if you use -ffreestanding.
Don't re-use C standard library identifiers (or use -ffreestanding.)
