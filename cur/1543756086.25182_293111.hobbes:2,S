I would try VNC for this, at least for debugging. But I don't really know
if it would have worked. My distro (Debian) has VNC packed nicely
(vncserver and xvncviewer packages), others should have it too. So the
trial should be rather quick if you use such Linux flavor.
I mean, open debugged app on a VNC display and have gdb on real one. You
can also view your VNC display with a viewer in a window and it should not
mess your real X session. But I may be wrong, never tried VNC for such
kind of work even though I use it very often.
One can also do similar thing with simply having two X sessions on two
consoles, I suppose. However, frequent switching between them may not be
very healthy for hardware.
Well, I'm just thinking loudly.

Tomasz Rola
