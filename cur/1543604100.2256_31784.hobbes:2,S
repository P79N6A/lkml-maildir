Same problem here (oops at boot, athlon 1.2GHz, kernels 2.4.9 ->10, athlon 
optimization. All goes right if I set i686 processor) but the patch didn't 
work. I have a GA-7VMM / VIA KLE 133 AGPset Motherboard. The kernel still 
oopses , it only changes color:) (white on black without patch, green on 
black with patch applied.)
I will be happy to test any new patch, if this can help.
