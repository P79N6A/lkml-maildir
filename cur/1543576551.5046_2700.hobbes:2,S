Hi Andrew,
I have 2 questions about your netdevice2.txt:
   
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/netdevice2.txt
 
* is withdraw_netdevice() really required, can't unregister_netdev
check "hidden", and notify the protocols/hotplug based on that value?
* I don't like the backward compatibility section:
<<<<<<<<
Other things:
     #define HAVE_PUBLISH_NETDEV
          This is for 2.2-compatible drivers.  They can do this:
          #ifdef HAVE_PUBLISH_NETDEV
          #define init_etherdev prepare_etherdev
          #define publish_netdev(dev) do {} while (0)
          #define withdraw_netdev unregister_netdev
          #endif
>>>>>>>>
As far as I know Linus prefers backward compatibility the other way
around:
<<<<<<
A 2.4 driver that must remain compatible with 2.2 should use
the new interface and add these lines to their source file:
       #ifndef HAVE_PUBLISH_NETDEV
       #define prepare_etherdev init_etherdev
       #define publish_netdev(dev) do {} while (0)
       #define withdraw_netdev unregister_netdev
       #endif
>>>>>>
