IMO, yes its the right format, since it identifies which device, and in a
consistent way similar to dev_printk().  What's more important than re-opening
this debate is making the current version available in the base so drivers can
start being modified to use it.  The message-prefix could change, if
experience indicates a benefit for consumers of printk messages.

There are cases where a configurable prefix makes sense, but the goal here for
netdev_printk() was clearly stated from the beginning (id which device...no more, 
no less).

Yes, for reasons already stated.
