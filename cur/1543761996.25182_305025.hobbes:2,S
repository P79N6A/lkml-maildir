    I don't want to blink a whole screen of text... But I think I
know what you mean, for blinking some text on the screen you need to
be able to blink the entire screen.

    I assumed that the textmodes of framebuffer supported all
capabilities that the standard text modes support... So, no blinking
text in framebuffer, am I wrong?
