:-)  No worries.
Just to be clear, by "these specific patches at first", I mean the 
"hrtimer: removing all ur callback modes" ones:
 ca109491f612aab5c8152207631c0444f63da97f
 37810659ea7d9572c5ac284ade272f806ef8f788
 a0a99b227da57f81319dd239bc4de811b0f530ec
By "rest of the patches", I mean the above plus the others created by
Peter for hrtimers.  Full list:
 ca109491f612aab5c8152207631c0444f63da97f

The first 3 git patches listed above are working for me so far, so I have 
not had a need to try the others.

nmi_watchdog 1 or 2?  I'm running with 2 which I've read does not disable 
hrtimers, right?
I mention it because my original HTB/hrtimers-related crash on .28 was 
without nmi_watchdog altogether.  I added both "nmi_watchdog=panic,2" and 
Peter's first 3 patches (ca1, 378, a0a) at the same time, to produce an 
apparently stable system.
I wish I had a repro scenario in a non-production environment, so I could 
help out further with this.  If I did, I would test without nmi_watchdog 
while trying just 2.6.28 and Jarek's #4 patch.
