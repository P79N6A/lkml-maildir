yeah. I dont really support the even/odd release thing because even the 
old 1.2/1.3/2.0/2.1/2.2/2.3/2.4 scheme _always_ confused non-insiders. 
Sometimes i saw it confuse people who already understood the GPL ;-) 
Furthermore it would just dillute our version numbers to encode some 
information that "-rc1" indicates just as well. Insiders know perfectly 
well that when -rc1 is released the merge window is closed. And what 
causes -rc elongation is usually not the lack of communication towards 
users or lack of testing but the lack of fixing power ...
