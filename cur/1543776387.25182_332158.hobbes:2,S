Some more investigation - it appears to be broken read-ahead, actually.
hdparm does repeated read(), lseek() loops which causes the read-ahead
logic to mark the file as being in cache (since it reads the same chunk
every time). Killing the INCACHE check (attached) makes it work fine for
me, Grant can you test if it "fixes" it for you as well?
No ideas how to fix the read-ahead logic right now, I pondered some
depedency on sequential but I don't see how it can work correctly for
other cases. Perhaps handle_ra_miss() just isn't being called
appropriately everywhere?
