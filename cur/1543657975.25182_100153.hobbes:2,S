Hi,
Patch below will allow for mounting of root from a DAC960 raid device
This has been submitted before (Leonard,Oliver,others), but I'll submit it 
again.
Reason:	
Needed to boot of a DAC960 raid device
Precedents/Justification for Patch:  	
Root support for compaq raid is included
Root support for ata raid is included
DAC960 driver is included but root support is not
Cheers
Rick
