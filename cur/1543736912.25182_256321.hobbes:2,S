Just about any out-of-kernel driver using Changed-API-X will be broken, free 
or non-free. Something more general like linux-drivers or 
linux-kernel-drivers would probably make more sense.
Sometimes changes in -mm even break in-kernel drivers; it's not really an 
"NVIDIA problem" as such. I agree with Lee though; it's an unwritten rule 
that you prefix a subject with [OT] when speaking about something which isn't 
directly relevant to the kernel.
(By the way, if this breaks outside of -mm patches will appear for stable 
kernels on 
http://minion.de/
 as did with the 2.5 development tree.)
