A few months ago, I installed suspend2 on my laptop.  It worked great for
a few days, when suddenly my laptop started to get very hot and the fan
costantly went off, and then I started getting these:
---
Message from syslogd@localhost at Tue Aug  8 16:08:53 2006 ...
localhost kernel: CPU0: Temperature above threshold
Message from syslogd@localhost at Tue Aug  8 16:08:53 2006 ...

I even posted once since I thought I found the problem, but I was wrong.
So I decided to remove Suspend2 and go back to the normal kernel.
Recently, I've decided to try out swsusp.  Well, it has been working fine
for almost a week now.  But unfortunately, I just started to have my fan
go off constantly, and I'm getting the above messages again (hence why
the date on the messages is today). Checking out the temp, it's going into
the high 70C. That's not too bad, but it only happens when suspending
every night instead of shutting down.
This is a Thinkpad G41, with a P4HT and this is a unmodified 2.6.18-rc2
kernel.  I guess I'll have to start shutting down again, and only suspend
every so often.  But just thought I'd let the people of knowledge know.
