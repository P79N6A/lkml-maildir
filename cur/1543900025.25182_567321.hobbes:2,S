You don't have to copy everything.
And you anyway have to handle cases like e.g. most books where you are 
not permitted to copy them, but might want to point people to them.

You aren't legally permitted to update any OLS paper unless you've 
gotten explicit permission by the author. And when he gives legal 
permission, he can as well give you the LaTeX source. I'd expect legal 
and technical update possibilities to usually be related this way.
And you shouldn't include non-free documentation into the kernel sources.

Not at all.

You can only update things you are legally and technically able to 
update. For the rest, you can only ship pointers like kernel-docs.txt.
