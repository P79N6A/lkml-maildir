OK.  So the only possible X interaction currently is a D-state transition.

Thinking about this a bit more, we only *need* to block userspace from
accessing a device while it's going to cause lockups if we access the
device.  And we'll cause the lockup ourselves if we try to do more than
one of these operations at a time.  So BUG_ON is clearly the right
approach.  Of course, the backtrace might well finger the wrong culprit --
if someone forgot to release the block earlier, it'll catch the second
attempt rather than the missed (or infinitely delayed) unblock.  I don't
think it matters too much, and I don't see a nice way to capture the
other task (do a backtrace to a buffer somewhere in a special debug mode
...?)
