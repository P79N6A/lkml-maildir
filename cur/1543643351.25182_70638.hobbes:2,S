So Alex,
What did you do prior to flush cache being added or did you care?
If you are talking about suspend, apm, acpi issues -- I am not interested
at the moment.  It was not important to the folks at the top when I tried
to address the issue, and now I have my hands full with other things.
Sorry, but it will have to wait unless Marcelo wants it fixed and doing
half way solutions does not cut it.  If it is wrong in -ac that is where
it shall be fixed first.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
