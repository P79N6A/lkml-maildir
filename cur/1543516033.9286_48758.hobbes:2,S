Gerard was referring to the source code of the _OS_, not your benchmark!
And i have to agree with him: There is no way to understand what a OS
is really doing without looking at the source. (Reminds me of our X11
benches back in the "old times": only be running them on really slow
hardware we could see that some commercial servers were "optimized for
benchmarks" - they simply skipped some drawing operations. DOH!)
As for not having FreeBSD: simply look at www.freebsd.org...
