Alan/Linux,
I will post the DELL Laptop information on the chipsets Monday relative
to this problem.  If someone else has some DELL hardware to test,
I have posted the Ute-Linux ISO's at vger.timpanogas.org that use 
the 2.2.18pre-25 kernel integrated with David Hinds PCMCIA 3.1.22
and modutils 2.3.20.  They are at
Binary RPM
ftp://vger.timpanogas.org/ute-linux-iso/ute-bin-2.2.18-12102000.iso
Source RPM
ftp://vger.timpanogas.org/ute-linux-iso/ute-src-2.2.18-12102000.iso
This release has 2.2.18-25 integrated into the anaconda installer.  
This is the release I am seeing the DELL laptop problems when 
framebuffer is enabled under 2.2.18-25.  This is kindof tough to test 
properly without the integrated installer, so I have posted 
the iso's early if someone out there wants to help test with these
laptop problems.  IBM Thankpads passed with flying colors, BTW.
Jeff
