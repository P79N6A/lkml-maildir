I wonder if it isn't finally time to drop this parameter?  Now that 
there aren't a zillion arch implementations of this to fix, we only need 
to fix a dozen or so callers.

Mention preemption needs to be disabled?  Or allow preemption and take 
appropriate precautions internally?  It's not obvious to me that all the 
callers are calling with preemption disabled.
