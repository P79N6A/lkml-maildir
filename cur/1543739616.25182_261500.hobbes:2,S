Greetings;
for the last 3 or 4 minor revisions, and 3 different kde installs I 
have had a situation wherein the keyboard repeat goes down to less 
than 1 per second, making it very difficult to go back and fix the 
typu's my ancient fingers inevitably make.  The effect came and went 
at seemingly random times.
I hadn't noticed the effect during the approaches to final, -rc4 in 
particular maintained its snappiness from the keyboard very well.
This is not accompanied by an observable amount of cpu usage either.  
But its back, sometimes non-stop for several minutes at a time with 
-final.  I have NDI where to look, so I'll leave that to those that 
breath src code in their sleep.  In this sense, I'm a dumb beta 
tester making a use/feel report.

Cheers, Gene
