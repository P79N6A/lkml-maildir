Hi 
I was just wondering if there is any support for the 82371mx accelerator
in the IDE driver. It doesn't appear that way to me, but that can be my
fault :)
Just to be precise. I'm talking about this chip:
  
ftp://download.intel.com/support/chipsets/430mx/290525.pdf
I have tried stock debian 2.2 kernel (2.2.18.preX) and the harddrive is
detected as a standard drive:
   ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7, 0x3f6 on irq 14
A "hdparm -p /dev/hda" gives:
   HDIO_SET_PIO_MODE failed: Function not implemented
Compiling a new kernel my self didn't yield anything different!! Skimming
through the sources gave me the impression that there isn't support for
this particular IDE chipset.
cat /proc/pci gives:
....
Bus 0, device 1, function 0:
  Bridge: Intel 430MX - 82371MX MPIIX (rev 2)
    Medium devsel. Fast back-to-back capable. Master Capable. No bursts.
Can you help me out?? Anything wrong, or am I just not supposed to tune
the PIO modes on this laptop.
Regards Thomas
