Hi Eric!
	Yeah, Jeremy said he wanted it for Xen.  This is the advantage of
having code in front of us tho.

	Yep... haven't tried CONFIG_RELOCATABLE tho.  It's kinda exotic 8)

It was a PITA because we can't just load $0x18 into %ss: it has to be
$0x19.  I started doing it (read %cs, mask off bottom 2 bits, orl
__BOOT_DS), but between that extra code and the extra code to then
change segments back...  well, we have to skip the cli anyway so it was
easy to skip them all.
I think Jeremy said Xen doesn't start on the boot descriptors either.  I
have to wonder why we don't just run on the boot descriptors forever
(#define __KERNEL_DS __BOOT_DS etc)?

Yes, I want to clean that up with proper checks for signatures
(currently, if it's not ELF, it's assumed to be a bzImage).  Might as
well at least error out if there's some surprise.
Thanks for the feedback!
Rusty.
