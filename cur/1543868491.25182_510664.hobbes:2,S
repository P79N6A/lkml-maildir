Well, I think this is highly theoretical.  Namely, try_to_freeze_tasks() only
fails after the timeout that's currently set to 20 sec., and it yields the CPU
in each iteration of the main loop.  The task in question would have to refuse
being frozen for 20 sec. and then suddenly decide to freeze itself right before
try_to_freeze_tasks() checks the timeout for the very last time.  Then, it
would have to get preempted at this very moment and stay unfrozen at least
until thaw_tasks() starts running and in fact even longer.
I think we may avoid this by making try_to_freeze_tasks() sleep for some time
after it has reset TIF_FREEZE for all tasks in the error path, if anyone is
ever able to trigger it.
