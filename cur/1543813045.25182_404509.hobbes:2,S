O_DIRECT allows for zero copy IO, which saves a boatload of cpu cycles. 
  For disk IO it is possible to use O_DIRECT without aio, but there is 
generally a loss of efficiency doing so.  For network IO, O_DIRECT is 
not even possible without aio.
By using aio and O_DIRECT for network IO, you can achieve massive 
performance and scalability gains.
You said before that the kernel aio interface is not suitable for 
sockets.  Why not?
