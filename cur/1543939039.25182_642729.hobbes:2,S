With reference to 2.6.24-rc5, I see in <kernel/sysctl_check.c>
      3 #include "../arch/s390/appldata/appldata.h"
      4 #include "../fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_sysctl.h"
Can this be done any better?
Should we move these headers to the standard <include> folder? Protect
them with "#ifdef CONFIG_" ?
I have a x86 configuration and don't use XFS. Do I still need to carry
these source files around?
