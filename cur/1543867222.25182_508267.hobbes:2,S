Before running  "iwconfig wlan0 channel 8",  the card is set to
802.11a mode. iwconfig shows rate at 54Mb/s. But after setting the
channel, it sets to 802.11b mode, and I can't find a way to change
from 11Mb/s to 54MB/s.
"iwlist eth0 rate" only show up to 11Mb/s.
So, my problem is the card is always in 802.11b mode.
Thanks,
Jeff.
