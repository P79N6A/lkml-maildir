	I would prefer to fix the comment when this change actually
happens. I prefer comments to refer to the current reality, rather
than past/future situation. When you introduce wireless renaming, you
will need to verify the whole chain anyway, so you might as well fix
the comment while merging wireless renaming.
	Note also that my comment is technically correct. I did not
say 'netdev' but the more generic term 'network interface', and I
believe your wireless interface is a 'network interface', even if it's
not a netdev ;-)
	But if this really bugs you, please feel free to respin my
patch.
	Have fun...
	Jean
