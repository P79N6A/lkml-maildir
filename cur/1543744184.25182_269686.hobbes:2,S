at least i finally found the "bad" .config option: it's CONFIG_EDD.
when i disable this option (and only this options. i can use the same
.config as usual only disbaling this very option. diff is my witness.)
i can boot a current (!) 2.6.10-rc1-bk and a working snd-ens1371!
i'll test with CONFIG_EDD=m later on. here a short summary:
2.6.9         CONFIG_EDD=y   - OK
2.6.10-rc1-bk CONFIG_EDD=y   - OOPS!
2.6.10-rc1-bk CONFIG_EDD=n   - OK
2.6.10-rc1-bk CONFIG_EDD=m   - ??
yes, i'll continue to find out the ChangeSet but now i (and perhaps you
too, if you are as curious as me) will know where to look at.
i must admit that i was not entirely sure why i wanted to enable
CONFIG_EDD at all. if i had never enabled it, it'd have saved me a week
of bug chasing, but learning is fun, too.
thanks,
Christian.
