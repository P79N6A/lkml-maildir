Well standing back and squinting at the problem:
As it collects samples globally, oprofile is a system-wide thing.  And a
filesytem is a system-wide thing too, so one maps onto the other nicely.
But perfctr is a *per process* thing, and that doesn't map onto a
filesystem abstraction very well at all.
So unless someone comes up with a cunning way of getting your square peg
into a filesystem's round hole, I'd be inclined to stick with a syscall
interface.  Six syscalls would be preferable to
one-which-contains-a-switch-statement, please.
Enabling perfctr is an unprivileged operation, yes?  So if there are
security holes in your code then this exposes the entire system.  That sets
the bar pretty high.
