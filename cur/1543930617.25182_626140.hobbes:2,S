Actually, I found this one as well, but I wasn't sure what to do with it.  
This one is a bit more complicated because the line with the call to 
netif_rx is in an else branch if the #ifdef above is taken.  So I wasn't 
sure what would be the best way to solve the problem in this case.
Perhaps the solution would be just to save the value of the len field 
in a local variable in this case, as you proposed in your original patch.
