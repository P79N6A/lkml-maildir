Ok, I had a feeling that might be so. But I did not intend them to be
printed as '"meaningful" C escapes', I meant "why filter out \v or \f,
someone might find a clever use for them and they do no real harm
otherwhise"...

What I meant was not for the kernel to attempt to print something like \a
, but it could be useful for it's original purpose of making a sound.. If
it's simply filtering out what goes to the screen (log, serial line,
whatever), but not preventing other uses, then my comments made no
sense... and 0x0B is \v I believe...
