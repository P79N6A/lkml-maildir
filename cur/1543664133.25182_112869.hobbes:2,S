cpuburn will help you rule out defective CPU theory.
Also you can start removing/swapping hardware parts.

Test with some vanilla 2.4 kernels, not a distro one. If 2.4.20 crashes,
try some of the earlier kernels too. Compile them for 386 uniprocessor
with debugging and magic SysRq enabled. Provide your .config
Run your klogd with -x to make it stop decoding oopses.
Run oopses thru ksymoops and provide result.
Provide lsmod, lspci output, some of /proc/* files (interrupts etc)

People are going to CC you I believe, so don't worry.
