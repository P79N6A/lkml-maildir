Hi,
just compiled k3b and cdrtools here and ran into a problem
with my system not understanding __attribute_const__  when
including linux/cdrom.h.
#define:ing __attribute_const__  as empty before including
solved the problem.
I wonder if it is just me or if this should be fixed by including some
other file as well ?
