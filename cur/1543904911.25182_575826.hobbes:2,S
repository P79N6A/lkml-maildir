No it does not. If updatedb filled memory to the point of causing swapping 
(which noone is reproducing anyway) it HAS FILLED MEMORY and swap-prefetch 
hasn't any memory to prefetch into -- updatedb itself doesn't use any 
significant memory.
Here's swap-prefetch's author saying the same:

Now please finally either understand this, or tell us how we're wrong.
