I think the confusing bit is this:
this_rq->prev_cpu_load[i] = rq_src->nr_running;
where "this_rq->prev_cpu_load[i]" doesn't intuitively look like what it
means ;-) Even just 's/i/cpu/' would help a bit, or something (like 
wrapping it in macros). Seems it is correct as was though - thanks for 
explaining it.
