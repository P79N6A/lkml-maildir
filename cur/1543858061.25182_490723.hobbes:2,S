You'll need to resend the entire patch, I dropped it due to that 
comment.  In general, before a patch is applied, the patch will go 
through several revisions.  I don't apply things piecemeal, only the 
last (hopefully perfect:)) revision.
Also, as your email already guessed, attachments are to be avoided :/
