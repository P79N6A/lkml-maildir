Sounds like a solution.  I will see what I can do in that direction.
Maintaining a suitably pessimistic udelay with multi gigahertz chips
sounds like a challenge, so using outb to port 0x80 may be a
reasonable solution there. 
Alan, can you describe a little more what the original delay is needed
for?  I don't see it documented in my 8254 data sheet.  The better I
can understand the problem the better I can write the comments on this
magic bit of code as I fix it.
The oldest machine I have is a 386 MCA system.  Any chance of the bug
showing up there?  I'd love to have a test case.
Another reason for fixing this is we are killing who knows how much
I/O bandwidth with this stream of failing writes to port 0x80.
Eric
