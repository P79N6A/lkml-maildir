Okay, my system is doing it with a known good kernel as well
(2.6.21-rc4), so this is something else. Please ignore my report for
now. In the meantime, I'll be downgrading my hal and drm to what they
were a week ago to see if that fixes the problem.
(I knew better than to change more than one thing at a time, really I
did. Sigh.)
Thanks for your help regardless,
Ray
