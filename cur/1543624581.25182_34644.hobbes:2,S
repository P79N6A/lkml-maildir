Surely Ulrich will come up with a constructive proposal for
how to make gprof work with LinuxThreads.  He wouldn't
want an important tool like gprof to remain broken for
years, would he?
While I await his constructive response, perhaps I'll get my 
glibc patch in shape.
I am maintainer of what amounts to a tiny embedded linux
distribution, and I'm pretty sure my users would like
gprof to work.  (In fact, my boss's boss would really
like gprof to work.  This problem has a lot of visibility.)
