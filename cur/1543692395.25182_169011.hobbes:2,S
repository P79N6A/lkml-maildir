The idea is that you then have ifdefs on CONFIG_IPV6_SUPPORT not on
CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE.
The underlying point being that your static kernel should not change if
you change an option from 'n' to 'm'. It should only affect the kernel
image if you change options to/from 'y'.
We should remove the definitions of 'CONFIG_xxxx_MODULE' entirely from
visibility during the build of non-module files, to prevent further
breakage of this sort.
