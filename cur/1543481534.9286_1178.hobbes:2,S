Hi,
with everyone having a scanner nowadays, and memory sizes continuously
growing, I don't think that the default buffer size in sg.h is any longer
apprropriate. Since I don't have a better solution, I just set it to the
maximum size (does this limit still exist?).
And I think cdwrite is outdated and not maintained anymore, so I replaced
it with a pointer to cdrecord.
