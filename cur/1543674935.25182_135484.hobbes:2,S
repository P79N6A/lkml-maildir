   I'm going to try this (if it compiles ;). the ksoftirqd check is
   the one for the NAPI workload brought to attention by Dave.
Ksoftirqd should not be running on a properly functioning system.
In fact, I know lots of people who are simply making ksoftirqd
only run if we do the softirq loop N times where N is very large
in order to avoid the performance problems that result from ksoftirqd.
