So Jeff, are you telling me that the 4CPU&nbsp;Alpha with a few hundred
GB of disks hanging off of it sitting next to me is a PC?&nbsp; Sheesh...they
do make them big these days, don't they?&nbsp; C'mon, take a breath - you
told us all that you get a little too excited sometimes, and methinks this
is one of them.&nbsp; Although I do agree it's annoying to get stuck on
something as (relatively) stupid as this...
