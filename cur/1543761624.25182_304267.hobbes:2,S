I wanted the calls to sync_cmos_clock() to be made in a consistent environment. 
  This was not true when calling it directly from the NTP call code.  The change 
means that sync_cmos_clock() is ALWAYS called from run_timers(), i.e. as a timer 
call back function.

With the change below, it is always called from the timer call back code which, 
I believe, is always called with irq on.  Looks like I missed the comment :(
