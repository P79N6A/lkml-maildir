Yes, I can try rc1-mm5 which I grabbed this morning.  I also have -rc2 
coming in right now, but from the messages I see so far this evening, 
I'm beginning to think its a 'to be skipped' version.
FWIW, I didn't have a problem last night during the amanda run, I'd 
moved the run time back to 05 00 * * *.  The one that barfed was 
triggered at 55 4 * * * in cron-speak, and was a full level 0 on 
everything as I'd nuked the data and restarted it from day 1.
