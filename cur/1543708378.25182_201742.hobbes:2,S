given that they are completely different from the controller we know
as megaraid today this is an extremly bad idea.  Just put it into an driver
of their own, e.g. mptraid

This is a bad thing for 2.6, don't do it.  For 2.4 just leave the probe code as
it is there currently - any change during the stable series just confuses
users.

hotplug scsi in 2.4 is impossible without a host template per controller
which you don't seem to do and I'd advice against.

Umm, it's a PCI card - if it doesn't work on any PCI supporting architecture
it's a driver bug (either in your driver or the architectures PCI subsysyem)

While this makes sense it's not a change that should go into 2.4 anymore
as it changes existing setups
