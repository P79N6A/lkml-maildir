Are we discussing where the implementing code should go,
or where the isolated cpu map special file should be
exposed to user space?
And you didn't answer my other questions, such as:
 1) If your other patch to manipulate sched domains
    has code that belongs in kernel/cpuset.c, and
    special files that belong in /dev/cpuset, why
    shouldn't this one naturally go in the same places?
 2) Why ... why?  What would be better about sched.c
    and what's wrong with where it is (the code and
    the exposed file)?
