Agreed.  This is quite useful for NFS, (The caching policy in a
stateless protocol is a tradeoff discrepency/performance  tradeoff).
My focus 2.3 when hopefully all filesystems will be keeping their
dirty data in the page cache, and I don't want to pay the price for
other filesystems.
And as I have said because NFS doesn't wrap the mmap functions,
write + write isn't handled in the mmap case.
