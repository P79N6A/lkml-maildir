What about a kind of timer ?
If the driver gets the "reboot"-note, watch for activity and shut down
the hardware 5 or 10 secs after the last activity ?
Shutting down the Userprocesses is done in a similar way..."Send
term"...sleep 5...Send Kill..."...and when this happens, all unmounts
and kills should have already occured, so it can only be a question of
<5 secs until the last (raid-) process has exited.
Other possibility would only be to let the kernel send this message just
before he reboots the maschine via a BIOS-call...but even then you would
have to wait a little until the hardware reacts...difficult problem...
Solong...

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
