O_DIRECTORY means "refuse to open if not a directory".
Old kernels ignore the flag.
So Glibc then calls fstat() to check it's really a directory.
(opendir() is required to fail on non-directories).
Actually Glibc does 4 system calls: open, fstat64, fstat (when fstat64
fails), fcntl (...FD_CLOEXEC...).

The kernel getdents interface is almost identical to Glibc's
__getdirentries interface:
  0 => finished.
  -1/EINVAL => make your buffer bigger because it's not big enough
  for 1 large entry.
  N => read N bytes
The only significant difference is that it uses a different structure.
Glibc looks complicated because it translates between the structures, so
it must (a) pass a smaller buffer size to the kernel; (b) copy the
smaller returned structures to Glibc API structures.
If your dietlibc doesn't have to be binary compatible with Glibc, you
can just use the kernel-format structure as your API.
Btw, the kernel recently added getdents64, which uses the same structure
as Glibc API.  You could just use that if you're willing to require
current 2.4 kernels.
