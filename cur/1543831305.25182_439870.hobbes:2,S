Hoi,
hmmmmm then something really bad happened, so bad that even the
backtrace is corrupted ;(
I'm sorry to say but unless you already have a suspect, those are really
really hard to diagnose or fix. One thing you can do is remove all
modules you don't actually use (just from a statistical pov that reduces
the risk of it repeating)... and hope maybe a next backtrace does
provide more information.
