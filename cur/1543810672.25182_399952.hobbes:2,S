Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver Core fixe for 2.6.16-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/22/168

Here is a single changeset, backing out the umount/mount uevent removal
from the kernel tree.  It was my fault in the first place for thinking
that this event could be removed, as I was not aware the current version
of HAL depended on it so much.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
The patch will be sent as a follow-up message for those that wish to see
it.
thanks,
greg k-h
