This stack looks very much like the problem with scsi queue plugging
behaviour and the removal of blk_empty_queue. It is not always hit, there
could easily be something in ac that changed the timing.
[If so] this is not a problem in the ac kernel, even though you only hit
it after adding the ac patch.
James B sent in a fix, it's included in the current bk tree, the changelog
says:
  fix scsi queue plugging behaviour
  Following recent changes removing blk_queue_empty(), we were
  incorrectly plugging the queue some times (most often as part of
  the SCSI scan process).  This was causing a non-deterministic panic
  in the scan code because a destroyed queue was sometimes being
  unplugged and run.
Or see this for log and patch:

|ChangeSet@-2d
The patch won't apply cleanly on top of 2.5.67.
