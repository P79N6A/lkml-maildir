I think since we introduce BUF_PAGE_SIZE instead of PAGE_SIZE for
buffer_page, we should make it changeable. We can use Non-order-0
allocations, but it doesn't mean we have to use Non-order-0 allocations.
In the old codes, these lines confuse me:
return (addr & ~PAGE_MASK) - (PAGE_SIZE - BUF_PAGE_SIZE);
addr &= PAGE_MASK;
This patch mostly make the codes concordant.
