Subject: 2.2.19 aic7xxx breaks pcmcia

2.2.19 Documentation/Changes says pcmcia-cs 3.0.14.  I am using 3.1.21
and it breaks if you compile the kernel with scsi support then try to
compile pcmcia.  clients/apa1480_stub.c in 3.1.21 has
  #include <../drivers/scsi/aic7xxx.h>
but in 2.2.19 that file is drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.h.  You need at
least pcmcia-cs 3.1.25 for kernel 2.2.19 with scsi support.
In the kernel and associated utilities I want to remove lines like
  #include <../drivers/scsi/aic7xxx.h>
and replace them with
  #include "aic7xxx.h"
with the Makefile specifying -I $(TOPDIR)/drivers/scsi (2.2.18) or -I
$(TOPDIR)/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx (2.2.19).  Hard coding long path names
for #include is bad, especially when they contain '..'.  It stops
kernel developers moving code around and makes it difficult to do some
of the things I plan for the 2.5 Makefile rewrite.  David, how easy
would it be to change pcmcia to this style of include?
