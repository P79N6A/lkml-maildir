Please be extremely careful with things like this.
E.g. this hunk does not seem to be correct to me, you should kill that if
with return -EINVAL completely.
Maybe the if should look like
if (new_rlim.rlim_cur > RLIM_INFINITY || new_rlim.rlim_max > RLIM_INFINITY)
	return -EINVAL;
(but this would give you a warning with -W anyway on arches where
RLIM_INFINITY is ~0UL, but not all of them define it that way).
On several platforms (i386 included) RLIM_INFINITY is ~0UL and values like 3G are valid.
Also, if you cast an unsigned long to signed (which means int), you break all the 64bit
ports (by killing top 32bits). I think your patch should be checked
carefully because this will not be the only place where it happens.
