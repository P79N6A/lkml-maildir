The "state of all the devices in the system". Presumably, while you 
walk the tree the first time (to save state) interrupts are enabled, 
and devices are active. Operations (including interrupts) on the 
device can, presumably, change the state of the device after its 
state has been saved.
To take a crude example, suppose you save the state of an Ethernet 
NIC, then change its MAC address, and then suspend the device. The 
saved state now has the wrong MAC address.
In this particular case, of course, the driver can keep a soft copy 
of the current MAC address and and restore from that, but that means 
making special cases of special things.
Look at it another way. Why not save the state at the beginning of 
time (say when the device is first initialized) instead of walking 
the tree at suspend time? Presumably because there's some difference 
between the state then, and the state at suspend time. How did that 
difference happen, and why couldn't it happen after the save-state 
tree-walk but before the actual device suspend?
