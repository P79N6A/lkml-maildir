Right. Parted is definitely looking for (co)maintainers (note, I've never
written parted is unmaintained, even though I think _practically_ it is).
Unfortunately most discussions were in private with FSF/GNU people after I
wrote this to the bug-parted mailing list
  
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-parted/2004-03/msg00091.html
I'm sure Andrew won't be angry if I quote one of his private emails
(please note he is quite busy with his study, made already heroic efforts
but clearly couldn't/can't focus on the emerging issues).
  Final comment: I think I am inadequate as a maintainer for GNU Parted.
  However, as there are no other volunteers, I am better than nothing.
  Some people have started working on Parted, and I make try to give them
  advice, apply patches, etc.  But, all of these people to date have been
  too busy to take over long-term Parted maintainence.

He was told many many times since last November how to do it correctly.
Even you told him but he still couldn't cope with all the tasks.

Please see subject: "[RFC] Restoring HDIO_GETGEO semantics", it has
nothing to do with parted maintaince.
Fixing parted won't fix all the tools people currently use still trusting
the newer kernels. You can't force everybody to replace immediately their
parted/etc even if they got fixed.
Sorry, I can't explain better. Maybe somebody who gets what I want to say
could translate it to real, understandable English. I'd really appreciate.

Unfortunately things always went to the wrong direction in the last 8
months. No matter who and how tried to explain.

I've seen only Patrick mentioning this.

Exactly. This is why e.g. ntfsck, mkntfs, recovery and other tools need to
get this value reliable from somewhere. But they can't.
