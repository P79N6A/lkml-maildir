In the work I've been doing, I've found it very helpful to open a text
editor, and make a call graph for the task I'm interested in -- in your
case, a graph of every function that gets called upon receive, starting
with your network driver's receive function.
Doing a similar one for Tx would be useful for you as well, though I'd
start with the UDP output path, as it was pretty simple.

xfrm_lookup() is only called for outgoing packets, not for received
packets.  I don't think ping replies (ICMP echo replies) will ever have
a non-NULL sk, as they are not associated with a socket.
