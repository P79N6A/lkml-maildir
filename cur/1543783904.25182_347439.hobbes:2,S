Yes, I agree.

The interface in x86 is fine, I agree. But the problem I see, is that we
would now have *3* different implementations of dyn-tick. At the point
where Con or anyone else is ready to propose merging of the code, I
think the dyn-tick work comes across much better if it simultaneously
unifies the existing NO_IDLE_HZ implementations in common files where
appropriate.
