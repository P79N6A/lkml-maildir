Martin,
You didn't list your kernel configuration.
Make sure you have CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD=y (not =m) for root mirroring.
This is easy to forget, since the default is =m.
The others should be able to be modules, however you know that 
the module interface is radically changed in 2.5.45 and beyond,
so trying it with the other scsi & raid modules compiled in would 
be a good test.
Andy

Root on raid-1 works fine for me, with and without devfs.  My kernel has
no module support, everything is compiled in.  I don't use initrd.
I have used root-raid with every 2.5 kernel except for a few that had
raid bugs. (Affecting all raid, the root weren't special.)
Until recently the root raid always did an unclean shutdown, but this didn't
cause other trouble than a bootup resync.
