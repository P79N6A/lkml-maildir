Add info that the Code: bytes line contains <xy> or (wxyz) in some
architecture oops reports and what that means.
Add a script by Andi Kleen that reads the Code: line from an Oops
report file and generates assembly code from the hex bytes.

+Alternatively, you can use the shell script in scripts/decodecode.
+Its usage is:  decodecode < oops.txt
+
+The hex bytes that follow "Code:" may (in some architectures) have a series
+of bytes that precede the current instruction pointer as well as bytes at and
+following the current instruction pointer.  In some cases, one instruction
+byte or word is surrounded by <> or (), as in "<86>" or "(f00d)".  These
+<> or () markings indicate the current instruction pointer.  Example from
+i386, split into multiple lines for readability:
+
+Code: f9 0f 8d f9 00 00 00 8d 42 0c e8 dd 26 11 c7 a1 60 ea 2b f9 8b 50 08 a1
