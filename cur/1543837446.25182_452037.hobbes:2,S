You have a particularly dense compiler, unfortunately.  This code
has always been this way, its just a false cc warning that can be
safely ignored until you upgrade to a fixed compiler (unless I'm
missing something - please enlighten me if so).  It does seem to
be the case that there is no way 'rtx' will be used uninitialised
when xfs_rtpick_extent() doesn't fail... no?
cheers.
