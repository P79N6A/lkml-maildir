The group I work in has been experimenting with GFS and Lustre, and I did
some NBD/ENBD experimentation on my own, described at
http://dcs.nac.uci.edu/~strombrg/nbd.html
My question is, what is the current status of huge filesystems - IE,
filesystems that exceed 2 terabytes, and hopefully also exceeding 16
terabytes?
Am I correct in assuming that the usual linux buffer cache only goes to 16
terabytes?
Does the FUSE API (or similar) happen to allow surpassing either the 2T or
16T limits?
What about the "LBD" patches - what limits are involved there, and have
they been rolled into a Linus kernel, or one or more vendor kernels?
Thanks!
