Using the current glibc implementation on a compressed file system ideally
should be a very expensive no-op because you won't actually allocate much
space for a file when writing zeroes to it. You also don't benefit of a
contiguous allocation in logfs, since flash has uniform seek times over
all the medium.
I'd suggest you implement posix_fallocate as an real nop and just return
success without doing anything. You could also return ENOSPC in case
the blocks requested by posix_fallocate don't fit on the medium without
compression, but that is more or less just guesswork (like statfs is).
