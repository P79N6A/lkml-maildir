Hi, Folks
Another problem I meet in boot up is that the root filesystem
can be mount as readonly at first, but it fails to be mounted 
as read/write during boot up, the error reported as:
	The superblock can not be read or does not describe a correct
	ext2 filesystem. ...
	fsck.ext2 no such file or directory when trying to open LABEL=/
When I tried to fix it using fsck, it reports clean.
But the original root filesystem still exists, I can still boot up
using kernel image 2.2.16-22.	
Any help is greatly appreciated!
