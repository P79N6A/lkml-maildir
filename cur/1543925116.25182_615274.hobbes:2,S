preempt_disable is lousy documentation here. This and other cases
(lots of per_cpu users, IIRC) actually want a migrate_disable() which
is a proper subset. We can simply implement migrate_disable() as
preempt_disable() for now and come back later and implement a proper
migrate_disable() that still allows preemption (and thus avoids the
latency).
