Subject: IDE bugs for intel 440LX chipset in Test12?

All I can say right now is that enabling DMA on a 440LX chipset with
2.4.0-test12  or any other kernel I can remember has caused DMA timeout
and ide-reset problems.  Disabling dma on the harddrives doesn't help
that much either, I still get ide resets.   What I'm looking for right
now is some information on how to log what the kernel recieves from the
harddrive and possibly what it sends so I can give rik some better
information on what's going on in this chipset.  Thanks.
