The swapper relies on it being protected by the big lock.  The mm
semaphore is required when you need additional protection: specifically,
if you need to sleep while manipulating the vma lists (eg. in page
faults).

Correct, but you only need the one lock --- the big lock --- to read the
vma list, which is what the swapper does.  The swapper only needs write
access to the page tables, not to the vma list.

Massive deadlock, indeed.  We've looked at this but it is soooo painful.

... or an equivalent lock.  The big lock itself isn't needed if we have
a per-mm spinlock, but we do need something lighter weight than the mmap
semaphore to let the swapper read-protect the vma lists.
