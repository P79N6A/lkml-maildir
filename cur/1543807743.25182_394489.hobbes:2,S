Don't mislead yourself into thinking that "don't understand why anyone 
would do it this way" implies "don't understand how it works."
This is mostly a discussion of keeping the kernel simple and letting the 
applications cope with the constantly changing interfaces vs. keeping the 
application interface constant (or at least not breaking things which did 
work) and having the kernel more complex.
