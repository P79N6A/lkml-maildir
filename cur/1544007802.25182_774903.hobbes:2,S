And in s390 we have:
block/
char/
cio/
crypto/
ebcdic.c
kvm/
Makefile
net/
s390mach.c
s390mach.h
s390_rdev.c
scsi/
sysinfo.c
So we end up with block drivers in drivers/block AND drivers/s390/block
This is the wrong way to divide up things.
find -name arm
./net/arm
./scsi/arm
find -name cris
./net/cris
find -name x86
./lguest/x86
See above. I have all net drivers under drivers/net/ and for 
arm and cris they have their own subdirectory.
Except for s390 where I have to go finding them in other places.

The approach has been for a long time to move away from
storing drivers under arch/*/drivers and cris is slowly
moving their drivers.
I dunno about um and sh.
