Yep, the vmcore should be around the size of the memory on the dumping
system. The size is too small and vmcore-incomplete wasn't made into
vmcore, so it's incomplete.
Do you have access to making a new kernel? Here's a fix that I think
will help. This will speed things up and help with the timeout issues.
drivers/net/netdump.c :
1) Initialize jiffy_cyles to 1000 * (1000000/HZ) -
-static unsigned long long t0, jiffy_cycles;
+static unsigned long long t0, jiffy_cycles = 1000 * (1000000/HZ);
2) Change prev_jiffies from an "int" to an "unsigned long" in
print_status() function -
-       static int prev_jiffies = 0;
+       static unsigned long prev_jiffies = 0;
Let me know if this helps,
Thanks,
Dan
