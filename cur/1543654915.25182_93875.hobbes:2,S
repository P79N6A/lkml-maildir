Ok, this looks fine to me. At this point my only issues are purely
cosmetic, namely that "suseconds" thing made me go "wtf?". I have _never_
actually seen it used, it's one of those stupid typedefs that have no
point to them.
Since the only use of "suseconds" is in the "compat_timeval" definition,
and since you already have a "compat_timespec", my reaction is to ask why
we don't just make "compat_timeval" be the arch-supplied typedef, and drop
that strange "suseconds" thing entirely?
That avoids a very awkward name, _and_ it looks more natural to pair
compat_timeval and compat_timespec anyway.
(Yeah, I know we use suseconds_t in the "real" timeval declaration, and I 
think that's strange too.)
I'll do that change by hand, and apply this to get the ball rolling, ok?
