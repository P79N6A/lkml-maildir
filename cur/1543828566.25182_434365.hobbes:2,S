Subject: Why is activate_task() used in __migrate_task()?

It would seem to me that using activate_task() in __migrate_task() in 
lieu of __activate_task() has two undesirable consequences: 1) 
recalculating and resetting prio and 2) resetting the time stamp.  The 
fact that the time stamp is adjusted for the change of run queue just 
before activate_task() is called reinforces my suspicion that these 
consequences are unintended.
Is there a reason for using activate_task() that I can't see?
