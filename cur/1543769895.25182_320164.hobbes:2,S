HI Jeff et al,
If you are referencing the commented out debug messages, I apologize,
and will endeavor to omit those in the future.

The SCSI inquiry command does not work on this device for reasons
unknown to me.  I saw in the code where the SCSI inquiry command was
"emulated", or handled in software, for ATA devices.  I simply copied
that method for ATAPI devices.  At least that was my intent.  I cloned
one function, modified it slightly, and (I thought) called it in a
reasonable place.

I fail to see how other devices would have been killed by this patch.
The inquiry data were simply moved from one data structure to another.
I tested this patch on my system with many different reads, mounts, and
unmounts and never generated an oops.  Would you tell me what you did
that caused an oops?  That would help me to improve my testing before
attempting to submit future patches.

Aw, come on, Jeff.  I gave it a shot, I'm trying to give back to the
community rather than simply complain.  OK, so my work isn't perfect,
and you've pointed ont valid technical reasons why.  At least *I tried*
to contribute code rather than just offering complaints, and I'm willing
to admit that I'll need to try harder in the future.

As with any patch, it is completely at the discretion of the kernel
developers as to whether it gets included.  If you believe this patch is
inappropriate, then please ask Andrew Morton to remove it, and I'll
respect the decision.
Thanks for looking at the code and for offering your comments.
Andy
