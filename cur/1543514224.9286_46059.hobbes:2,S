Hello,
 I thought I should weigh in on a couple of issues here.
I was the one that informed Loki about not using 2.2.12 for Call to Power
after a user of em86 reported to me that they found a bug
in the Floating Point emulation. Which Then I also found
occuring in CTP. From what I can gather
on certain math operations if you send in an unaligned argument the
Floating Point Emulation code causes an exception unaligned access
which it dosen't or can't catch. the 2.2.12 kernel was the only
one I saw this problem with. I haven't tried the newer 2.2.XX kernels
and the problem has not occured under the 2.3.X kernels.
On the side note I think the FP emulation should stay in the kernel. 
I remember Minix....
On the side note to all of this is has anyone got the Xfree86 3.9.16
to work yet on an Alpha?? The server crashes on me with an exception
and I haven't been able to track it yet... <grin>
