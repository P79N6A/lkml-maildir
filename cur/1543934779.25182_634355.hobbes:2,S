We see this on both NUMA and non-NUMA. x86_64 and ia64.  The basic
criteria to reproduce is to be able to run thousands [or low 10s of
thousands] of tasks, continually increasing the number until the system
just goes into reclaim.  Instead of swapping, the system seems to
hang--unresponsive from the console, but with "soft lockup" messages
spitting out every few seconds...
