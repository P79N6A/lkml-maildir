	Sorry, I'm mixing up my numbers.
	The cutoff for the ESSID fix is 28-pre15, so your version is
just a little bit older. I'm mixing up with the iwpoint cutoff which
was 27-pre25.

	I don't have the start of the thread, so I don't know the
exact failure mode. If you are using wpa_supplicant, it bypasses the
wireless tools so it would have to be updated.
	Note that I've been pestering Jouni about the fact that he had
to update wpa_supplicant for that since last May, when Jouni himself
asked me to change the ESSID API. Ironic, isn't it ?
