Certainly, but much harder to implement.  The ELF parser needs to be
prepared to move itself around to get out of the way of the ELF file. 
It's a fairly large change from how it works now.
I was thinking of making the ELF file entirely descriptive, since its
just a set of ELF headers inserted into the existing bzImage structure,
and it still relies on the bzImage being build properly in the first place.
