The product of:
        {exotic PMU modes} * {creative performance measurement ideas}
will produce a large number of candidates for these special counters
(at least on ia64 ... which has a large number of exotic PMU options).
I don't think that I'm qualified to judge which of them are "useful enough"
to warrant a special counter type.
