I agree it's the server side that will eventuelly push it through,
but don't expect miracles. I informed the sysadmins at the place 
where I work that ftp.kernel.org isn't reachable anymore for us, 
only to get a long reply full of reasons (some better than others) 
why they wouldn't act. The final statement was: "use one of the 
many ftp.<country>.kernel.org mirrors".
