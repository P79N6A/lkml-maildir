I don't get this. From "man getmntent" it seems that getmntent is just a 
parser for /etc/mtab, and that you must call "setmntent" with the 
filename you want to parse.
So if you do "setmntent("/etc/mtab",...)" you're explicitly saying that 
you want getmntent to use /etc/mtab. This is just a open/read in disguise.
Am I missing something?
