hmm..  OK, thanks.
Chris, this seems to be a worthwhile improvement to mainstream
reiserfs, independent of the low-latency thing.   You can
probably achieve 10 milliseconds with just a few lines of
code - a subset of the patch which Shawn tested. (Unless you
were planning on magical algorithmic improvements...).
I'm all set up to generate those few lines of code, so
I'll propose a patch later this week.
