Took a deeper look.
I saw one reference to LDFLAGS_$@ that is wrong:
    LDFLAGS             Generic $(LD) options
        Flags used for all invocations of the linker.
        Often specifying the emulation is sufficient.
        Example:
                #arch/s390/Makefile
                LDFLAGS         := -m elf_s390
        Note: EXTRA_LDFLAGS and LDFLAGS_$@ can be used to further customise
        the flags used. See chapter 7.
The chapter reference is also bad...
The other references to the LDFLAGS_$@ are in other situations - it is
used in several places.
If your example requires the LDFALGS_$@ I wil introduce it - for now
it has not been required (except for vdso support where it was hacked).
