Hi all,
I just want to confirm this bug as well and unfortunately it was my
system disk too who had to take the hit. Im running 2.6.16 and its
reproducible in 2.6.17 and 2.6.18-rc1 as well. When I tried to repair
the fs I got the same error as in the previous post, running xfsprogs
2.8.4. I haven't had the time to debug this issue further because the
box is quite critical but I'll keep an eye on the other disks on the
system still running xfs.
Regards,
Mattias Hedenskog
