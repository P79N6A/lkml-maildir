I am having odd problems with the cs4232 module on a computer the the
cs4236 chip set.
When I first try to insert the module with the correct args, it fails
in the init_module (insmod cs4232 io=388 irq=7 dma=1). If I try to insert
it at a specific (but bad) set of arguments (insmod cs4232 io=534 irq=7
dma=1), init_module will fail after about a minute and leaving the system
non-responsive until it fails. Following this, the first insmod settings
will work just fine.
Any ideas as to what is going on here? If it would work the first time I
could script this and not worry.
Thanks,
Keith
