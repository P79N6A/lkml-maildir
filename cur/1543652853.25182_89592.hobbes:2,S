Once you remove a handler from the list, any subsequent NMI is *not*
going to see the handler. So even if another CPU is executing the same
handler, if you wait for the RCU callback, you can guarantee that
no-one is executing the deleted handler. RCU will wait for all the
CPUs to context switch or execute user-level code atleast once.
That meant any other CPU which might have been executing the NMI
handler at the time of deletion has now exited from the handler.

Corey's code doesn't rely on completion() to ensure this, it relies
on RCU to make sure that nobody is running the handler. The key is
that once the pointers between the prev and the next of the deleted
NMI handler are set, subsequent NMIs aren't going to see that handler.
context switch/user-level means that CPU must have exited any
NMI handler it may have been executing at the time of deletion.

spin_trylock modifies the lock cacheline, so cacheline bouncing.
