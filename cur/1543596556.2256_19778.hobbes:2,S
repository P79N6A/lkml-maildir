Howzit Andrew,
OK, I'll give the patch a try.  I'll only be able to provide feedback
after about 12-24 hours though, depending on when I can reboot.
Hardware is pretty standard stuff:
Dual CPU Pentium II 233Mhz.  128MB RAM, Gigabyte motherboard (circa
1998), 20Gb IDE disks, realtek 8139 100Mb card.  Pretty std stuff. 
What's weird though is that this oops doesn't occur on our several
*very* busy clustered cache servers (running squid) - only one task
though (ie, squid/diskd/dnsserver), whereas the problem machines run
various apps.
Cheers
Henry
