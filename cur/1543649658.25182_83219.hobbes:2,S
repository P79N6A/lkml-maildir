When the attacker can look into the .bash_history of root he has already
taken over the box. As Alan already stated before on this thread, when
the attacker has root, the game is over anyway - what happens next only
effects how long it will take you to find out you have 'guests'.
The purpose of the GPG spiel is to stop (read: make it harder) from the
attacker becoming root in the first place, for example by replacing
packages you download (either on the ftp site or in trnasit) with
trojaned copies.
