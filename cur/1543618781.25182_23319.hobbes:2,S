I ended up calling sys_getcwd from Perl as it's extremely fast.  Even
faster if you hard code the syscall number instead of reading the header
file in Perl :-)
However, I was still impressed by the 0.0075s for a pipe/fork/exec.
'use POSIX' is very slow, but Perl's getcwd() is pretty slow too -- it
does the old fashioned directory walk.  We cannot blame it for being
portable.
