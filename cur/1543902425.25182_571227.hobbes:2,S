The size increase makes this a complete non-starter in the
embedded configs I'm familiar with.  Size is still the number
one problem using Linux in consumer electronics products.
I have nothing against this patch, if it achieve some speedups
for other environments.  But I wouldn't expect to see this
option used much in embedded devices.
