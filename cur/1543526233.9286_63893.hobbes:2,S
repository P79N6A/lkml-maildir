This is the statistics of entry-path of the mail flood got from the
received mails headers.
	fgwmail		83
	fgwnews		82
	fgwmail5	45
	fgwmail6	31
	-------------------
	total		241
count(fgwmail) = count(fgwnews)  =near  count(fgwmail5) + count(fgwmail6)
In your above scenario, why hundreds of duplicated mails are
delivered?
If deliveries to fgwmail5/fgwmail6 always succeed, the duplicated
mails should be not more than 3 or so.  Is it wrong?

I asked to the admin of fgwmail/fgwnews to investigate the machine
status and I forwarded your analysis of them.
I'll report thier investigation result when I get.

It's your nice CGI script..
I also tried but he claimed nothing.
BTW, what do you mean "not acknowledged"?
