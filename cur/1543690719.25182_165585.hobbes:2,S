I am not really bothered about code size, as I tried (?) to say.

Ok, thanks.

Yes, given.  I just don't think most people know or look at it the
same.  I for one usually just try not to add anything not needed
at the cost of some minor speed regression, as things many times
especially in a big project sometimes tends to get out of hand,
as all those minor regressions added is one big regression.  I do
however admit that I will be a bit out of my league trying to
judge in this case, but it still would be interesting ....
I however will not keep this up if you guys say its is fine.
Two things however does still does bother:
1)  What will it look like after being put through some benchmarks
just to verify.  I may however just need to get to bed early for
a change =)
2)  Will it be that difficult to also patch it in at boot like
the rest.  Once again it might just be paranoia from my side 8)
Thanks for the more in depth info.
