You can always do the following: use a mini root fs on the partition 
where the kernel is located that does nothing but vgscan and friends and 
then calls pivot_root. '/sbin/init' of the mini root fs looks like:
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
         -s|S|single|-a|auto)
                 opt=$1
         ;;
         -b|emergency)
                 export PATH=/bin:/sbin
                 /bin/mount /proc
                 /bin/loadkeys \
			/keymaps/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
                 exec /bin/sh < /dev/console > /dev/console 2>&1
         ;;
esac
cd /
/bin/mount /proc
/bin/mount -o remount,rw,notail,noatime,nodiratime /
/sbin/vgscan > /dev/null
/sbin/vgchange -a y > /dev/null
/bin/mount -o remount,ro,notail,noatime,nodiratime /
/bin/mount /mnt
/bin/umount /proc
cd /mnt
/sbin/pivot_root . boot
exec /bin/chroot . /bin/sh -c \
	"/bin/umount /boot ; exec /sbin/init $opt" \
	< dev/console > dev/console 2>&1
And if you have partitions of the same size on other disks and fiddle a 
bit with dd you have perfect working backups including the boot loader 
code of the master boot record on the other disks. No initrd required.
As an add-on you have an on-disk rescue system.
