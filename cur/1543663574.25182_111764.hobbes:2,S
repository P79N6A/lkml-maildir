I have had this for disks, but not for memory, CPU or board.
However, I have now shared the load between both machines, and
downgraded one of the boxes to vanilla 2.4.19.
We'll see how they behave, and probably exchange the hardware. The
colocation rack is getting full anyway, and those ServeLinux 1U boxes
are nifty.
Greetings
