Without Microsoft, there wouldn't be 2,4 GHz 32/64 bit microcomputers
with 512 megabytes of main memory, 120 gigabytes of hard disk space
and 1600x1200 pixels 32 bit resolution and 3d real time capability for
< $1000 on sale at your local discount store. Simply because there
wouldn't be a market for this.
Face it. Microsoft Software is, what made the breakthrough to really
put a powerful machine in every home and allow the 2-5% of the owner
base which are Linux users to get really cheap commodity hardware.
Not IBM did this. Not Commodore. Not Apple. Not Linux.
