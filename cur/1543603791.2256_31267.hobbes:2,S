And exactly how is low latency going to hurt the majority?
This reminds me of when 4GB on ia32 was enough, or 16 bit UIDs, or...
Should those have been left out too just because the people who needed them
were few?
If the requirements for manufacturing control, or audio processing, or etc
will make my home box, or my server work better then why not include it?
