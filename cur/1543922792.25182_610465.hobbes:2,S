The crash tool requires the dwarf data to work.  The dwarf data for an
entire kernel (including all the modules) is on the order of hundreds
of megabytes.  The symbol & marker list would be one thousandth the
size.  You can see the deployment attractiveness of the latter.

Nope.  /proc/kallsyms is a another run-time-only source of data, and
so is not applicable for off-line (ahead-of-time) mapping.

It is not superfluous, as it would solve a real distribution problem.
