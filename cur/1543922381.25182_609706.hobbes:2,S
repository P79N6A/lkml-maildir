I think the zaurus kernel deliberately ignored the bootparams passed in by the device's bootloader.  The 2.6.23 kernel now honors the r2 setting from the bootloader, which is most likely pointing to those ATAGs that were being ignored earlier.
I suppose you can hack up the logic in setup.c where the ATAGs are parsed, but it seems to me that it would be better to work out some logic, perhaps in the fixup section for that machine, to do whatever is necessary to override or otherwise get along with the bootloader.
