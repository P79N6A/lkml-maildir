  Well. wasn't the idea that unless programs specifically tried to
  open the file-as-dir as a directory it would look like a file?
  ls -F would show it as file. Or have I understood wrong?

  The meta-data should be deleted if it the file is copied or moved to
  a medium that doesn't support it. However a _warning_ may be shown
  to the user if there is risk to loose data.
  I do not think we should not implement something like this because
  most other filesystems in Linux doesn't support it. Think of other
  limitations there is in various ones. Large file support. Limited
  amount of files, length of file names, etc.

  No, if an application supported the file-as-dir then it could simply
  try to open the file as a directory. It would fail on systems that
  didn't support it.
  The meta-data and file streams would be seen as ordinary files. If
  applications support the contents or not isn't really relevant, is
  it?.

  Indeed. It is important that something like this gets implemented as
  a transparent way as possible. If it could be done in a general way
  so other filesystems like ext3/4 can eventually support it then that
  would be wonderful. I do not, however, think that we should block it
  in reiser4 because no other filesystems support it.
