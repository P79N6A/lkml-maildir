So you are talking about a 2 prong attack. One in where you somehow
trick program A to do something that it's allowed to. That then would
cause an error in program B ? Or cause program B to do something
wonky.
I guess a good example of this would be if you sent an email to
sendmail (which is constrained) to write the message to my mailbox
(which is allowed, obviously).
Then I use an imap daemon (which would not be constrained, in the
hypothetical, personally I constrain everything I can). To retrieve
that message but the payload of the message causes the imap daemon to
delete /lib ?
Is that a proper example? or do you mean something else?
