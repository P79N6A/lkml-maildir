correct, we can't keep the pipeline always full, the larger the size of
the read/write, the lower it will matter, this is the only way to hide
the pipeline stall at the moment (like with rawio).

yes, in short the API to allow the userspace to keep the I/O pipeline
full with a ring of user buffers is not available at the moment.
As you say one could try to workaround it by threading the I/O in
userspace but it would get rather dirty (and with a scheduling
overhead).

to do transparent readahead we'll need to use the pagecache, so we'd need
to make copies of pages with the cpu between usermemory and pagecache,
but the nicer part of O_DIRECT is that it skips the costly copies
with the cpu on the membus, so I usually disagree about trying to allow
O_DIRECT to support readahead. I believe if you need readahead, you
probably shouldn't use O_DIRECT in the first place.
