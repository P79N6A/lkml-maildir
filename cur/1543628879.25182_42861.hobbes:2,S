I have a FX505, which basically is a FX501 with Athlon 1.2GHz and some
other goodies.

1) Update the BIOS, my laptop shipped with an old version and a BIOS
   update fixed some keyboard related problems. (you need to boot into
   windows for this)
2) Apply the latest ACPI patch.

My FX505 doesn't need the sonypi driver. With APM I can suspend the
computer but the CPU fan won't turn off; with ACPI the CPU fan turns
off, but I can't suspend the computer. Anyway, the latest ACPI patch
makes it a lot more quiet.

You forgot to tell which kernel version you are currently using.
Anyway, linux-2.4.19-pre5 + acpi-20020329-2.4.18 works for me.
