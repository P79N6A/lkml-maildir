Subject: udev/aacraid interaction - should aacraid set 'removable'?

(lkml readers: this concerns a security issue reported to debian by a
user of udev/aacraid. udev gives the aacraid devices the floppy group
because it reports block devices as 'removable'. See
http://bugs.debian.org/404927
 for the entire thread).

I didn't turn up any otherwise when I was grepping yesterday, but my
search terms may have been too naive. I also checked a machine I had
w/ cciss - it did not have the removable flag set.
I found a message from Mark Salyzyn from last year that suggested this
was more pervasive:

Mark: Can you identify some of these other drivers?
