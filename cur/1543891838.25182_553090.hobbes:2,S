I agree. I'm addressing why things can't "just work", not arguing that they
aren't broken or should stay broken. ;)
I think a good solution would be to re-use the 'connect' and 'shutdown'
calls. You would need a new asynchronous flag to 'open' that would mean,
*really* don't block. You would have to follow up with 'connect' to complete
the actual opening -- the 'open' would just assign a file descriptor (unless
it could complete or error immediately, of course).
To asynchronously close such a socket, you simply call 'shutdown'. Once the
'shutdown' completes, 'close' would be guaranteed not to block.
Obviously, being able to 'poll' or 'select' would be a huge plus (while an
'open' or 'close' is in progress, of course, otherwise it would always
return immediate availability).
I think this covers all the bases and the only ugly API change is an extra
'open' flag. (Which I think is unavoidable.)

A working generic asynchronous system call interface would be the best
solution, I think. But that may be further off than just an asynchronous
file open/close interface.

Yeah, what a pain that would be. The obvious counter-argument to what I
propose above is that it doesn't handle reads and writes, so why bother with
a complex partial solution?
