put_char() is not allowed to fail since the caller should have already
checked for buffer space via the write_room() method.
All places look adequately protected in n_tty.c, so I'm not currently
sure how Jean's users are seeing this condition; I'd need to have a
BUG() showing the call trace of such an event happening.
