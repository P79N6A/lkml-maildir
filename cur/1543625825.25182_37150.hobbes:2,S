I had the correct option for mounting (in grub):
	kernel <some kernel> ro root=/dev/i2o/hda6
To work around the problem I reinstalled the system, where I put the / on a seperate disk, and /var, /usr, /tmp etc.. om the /dev/i2o/hda...
So there seems like there is a problem with the mount-program in the kernel.
