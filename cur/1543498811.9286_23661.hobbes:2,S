Adding a bit of steam, I just have this warning to those unfortunate
fellows who still need to run NT: don't boot NT with a ZIP disk in the
drive. I did this once with an almost emtpy disk (VFAT fs, of course)
and gave up after ~15 min of chkdsk (or however this is called today).
Flip the switch (of course IBM still don't think a reset button is
useful :-P), eject the disk, all is fine. No FS errors.
