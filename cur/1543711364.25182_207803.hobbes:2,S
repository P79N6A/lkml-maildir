Subject: [biocenter.helsinki.fi #2456] LVM2 problems with device mapper

Hello,
I'm trying to upgrade a machine to the 2.6.4 kernel.  I have a problem
with LVM, though, and it's preventing me from getting anywhere with this.
I've installed the LVM2 kit v2.00.08.
I've built the device mapper as a module.  The module loads without any
problems.  I am not using devfs, so I ran the devmap_mknod.sh script to
create the /dev/mapper/control device, which became c 10 63.
After this, running vgscan --mknodes finds the existing volume groups
with LVM1 metadata, but complains about not being able to access the
mapper control device.
Running vgchange -a y complains about not being able to access the
mapper control device and fails altogether.
I also tried rebuilding the kernel with the patches from
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/patches/.
  The device mapper module
version changed from 4.0.0 to 4.1.0.  No new error messages, but still
no functionality either.
If it's of any consequence, the machine is a Fujitsu-Siemens RX800 8-
way with the IBM Summit x440 chipset.  Support for the Summit x440 has
naturally been enabled in the kernel.
