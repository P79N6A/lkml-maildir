Subject: 2.4.4 aic7xxx drivers unloads with open sg handles

I am seeing the aic7xxx driver unload itself on 2.4.4 with sg 
loaded and with a user space app holding active handles.  Subsequent
closing and reopening of the /dev/sg0, etc. handles is not 
causing a modprobe autoload of the driver, as normally happens
after the code gets into this state.
Please advise.
Jeff
