If it's usually the same address, we're probably dealing with
a kernel bug. If you always get different addresses, chances
are your RAM is broken (you can test this with memtest86).
Decoding the oops is always useful, especially if you can find
a pattern after you've decoded a few. And if you don't manage
to find any pattern in them, you know the suspicion lies with
the hardware ...
