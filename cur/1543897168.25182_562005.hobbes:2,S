Just because someone has a different opinion than you or the FSF does
not make what they say a lie.  Is that particularly difficult to
understand?  It is exactly this kind of nonsense that makes people not
want to listen to the FSF and its advocates.

Well what the spirit is, is certainly debateable, and it seems there
probably won't ever be a consensus on that.  The thoughts in the head of
RMS are not the only ones that count in the world.

Any organization that claims anyone that doesn't agree with its view of
thw world and its interpretation of some written text is "confused" will
be treated like all other religigous fanatics, and not listened too.
Intelligent people know better than to listen to such groups.  Some of
us really can think for ourselves and don't have to be spoonfed
beliefs.

I think I know exactly as much about the GPL now as I did two weeks ago.
Repeating the same arguments to people again and again when they
consider the argument invalid isn't going to change their minds.
