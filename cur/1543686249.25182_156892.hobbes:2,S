I understand that mixing up vector and irq is very confusing. However, to support non-PCI legacy devices with IRQ less than 16, such as keyboard and mouse for example, may be impossilbe to achieve without mixing up. Some existing driver of legacy keyboard/mouse devices, for example, may use fixed IO ranges and fixed IRQs (as assigned to 1 for keyboard and 12 for mouse). If these device drivers use these fixed legacy IRQs and the interrupt routings for these non-PCI legacy devices use vectors, then the system may break. As you know, MSI support requires vector allocation instead of IRQ allocation since MSI does not require a support of BIOS IRQ table. Mixing vector with IRQ to be compatible with non-PCI legacy devices must be achieved. Last time, your suggestion of changing variable name from irq to vector is the good approach. I am looking at restructuring the code of the vector-base patch. I will send you an update when I am done for your feedback.

Since the code determinces whether this entry is NULL or not, I think any locking for msi_desc may not be required.

Good. Thanks!
Thanks,
