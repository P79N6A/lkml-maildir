Some of them are quite useful.  For example, the presence of this one in
dmesg and the logs typically (although not necessarily) indicates that
there was an OOM condition - and the interpreter name is useful to know
that the message indeed applied to /lib/ld-linux.so.2 rather than to
some user-supplied ELF interpreter (that could simply be non-existent).
Alan has recently suggested that another rate-limited user triggerable
message be introduced for set*uid() failing on transient errors.  Then,
what about warnings of emulated unaligned accesses on Alpha?  Those were
useful to me on many occasions.  There can be many other examples.
Also, for some printk()s it is difficult to say whether they're user
triggerable.  A printk() indicating a "machine check" or an ECC error
may well be user triggerable on a particular system.

Yet there are lots of such printk()s - and I suggest that we make a
determination on all of them before we possibly start fixing individual
ones.  In fact, perhaps there are too many of them to be fixing any in
2.4, unless we determine to somehow harden printk() itself.
Even current->comm is untrusted user input, but there are at least 58
printk()s of it in 2.4.33.  (58 is the number spotted by a grep that
would only match those that have current->comm on the same line with
printk itself.)
