you mean protocol dependent? yes,it goes trough the layer of the vfs but
I thought there may be a way to get to the struct net_device from the
struct file. You have the dev_base which contains all devices and in the
net_device there is the ifindex which is the unique identifier. I guess
there is no way to know the ifindex directly from a socket struct.
thanks
