Yes, I have, most recently in 2.6.20. It works fine.

Who told you that? There's documentation in the kernel tree in 
Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt that describes how to set this up properly.
Looking at your output, without knowing what the makefile contents are, 
it's impossible to determine what's going wrong. Likely the makefile is 
trying to do things that the kernel build system should be doing. For a 
simple module called mymodule with files file1.c, file2.c, file3.c you 
need only a makefile like this:
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
# kbuild part of makefile
obj-m  := mymodule.o
mymodule-y := file1.o file2.o file3.o
else
# Normal Makefile
KERNELDIR := /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
all::
         $(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=`pwd` $@
endif
