3.5. INSTRUCTION POINTER
[...]
The EIP register cannot be accessed directly by software; it is
controlled implicitly by control- transfer instructions (such as JMP,
Jcc, CALL, and RET), interrupts, and exceptions. The only way to read
the EIP register is to execute a CALL instruction and then read the
value of the return instruction pointer from the procedure stack. The
EIP register can be loaded indirectly by modifying the value of a return
instruction pointer on the procedure stack and executing a return
instruction (RET or IRET). See Section 6.2.4.2., "Return Instruction
Pointer".
