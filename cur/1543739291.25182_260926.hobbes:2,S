Please quit being a fuckwit, Richard. You've escaped my killfile so far
despite being in so many other peoples, because it's often amusing to
find the deliberate mistake in your posts when they actually appear
plausible. 
The above is not policy; it's a mechanism. It provides the information.
Developers _use_ that information to implement their own policy, and
refrain from helping those whose kernels are tainted. 
Signing kernel modules is just the same.
