Opening this question to a wider audience.
struct scatterlist gives us struct page*, and an offset+length pair. 
The struct page* is the _starting_ page of a potentially multi-page run 
of data.
The question:  how does one get struct page* for the second, and 
successive pages in a known-contiguous multi-page run, if one only knows 
the first page?
