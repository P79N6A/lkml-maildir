I can't figure out how to do a schedule() in 5 instructions (that's what's
needed when process X can't get resource Y). The common case is when you
can get your lock in the first step, and that's 5 instructions. If
something goes wrong, your last instruction is a taken branch, and it can
either take you back to try again (spin lock), or take you somewhere else
(traditional lock, with falling asleep).
Because of the design of spin-locks (locking should always only take a
short time, because others actively poll to get that lock), preempting a
process while it has a lock is just not an option. It hurts, then don't do
it.
But since the Linux kernel still has normal locks, we either go to
eliminate those altogether, or think about priority inheritence for them.

Have you really read the paper (I think you have written it)? The author
proposes several lock-free strategies to overcome the problem. Actually,
Linux doesn't use these lock-free strategies (at least not all over the
place, there are still locks), although it would be really nice if it
does.
