Tried 2.6.21-mm3. The GlidePoint is still unresponsive.

Going to try it ...
In fact, I already added the following line at the begining of each function in
drivers/input/mouse/alps.c
printk(KERN_ERR "start of function ...\n");
But no message is displayed when using the Glide Point. Interrupt are not
raised. The alps driver is not called by the i8042 handler.
