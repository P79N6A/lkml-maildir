4.10 Autodetection
Autodetection allows the RAID devices to be automatically recognized by the kernel at boot-time, right after the ordinary partition detection is done. 
This requires several things:
* You need autodetection support in the kernel. Check this
* You must have created the RAID devices using persistent-superblock
* The partition-types of the devices used in the RAID must be set to 0xFD (use fdisk and set the type to ``fd'')
---------------------------------------------
I guess you forgot to mark the partitions as type 0xfd.   I have a similar box
here with 2.4.1 and autodetect works like a charm.
Cheers,
