Hi,
I forgot to mention one more context. In the embedded environment where
one is memory constrained, the lightweight and low memory foot-print
module  I am referring to becomes relevant. In addition, since it is
highly reliable, and remotely manageable as listed below I feel it is
worth pursuing.
Thanks for your time.
Regards
Anand
