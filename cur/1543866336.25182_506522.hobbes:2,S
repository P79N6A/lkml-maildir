Agreed, the naming is confusing, and using private here doesn't quite
feel right.
A practical question is: Will we ever encounter these inodes
in the inode_init() path from superblock_init?  If all of the accesses
that we care about go through inode_doinit_with_dentry we can just
walk the dcache to get the names, and that should work for the normal
proc case as well.
A somewhat related question: How do you handle security labels for
sysfs?  No fine grained security yet.
If it doesn't look easy to solve this another way I will certainly
go with marking the inodes private.
