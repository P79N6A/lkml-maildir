It certainly needs a redesign.  A new sort of lock which makes it appear to
work won't fix races like:
int cpufreq_update_policy(unsigned int cpu)
{
	struct cpufreq_policy *data = cpufreq_cpu_get(cpu);
	...
	lock_cpu_hotplug();
I rather doubt that anyone will be hitting the races in practice.  I'd
recommend simply removing all the lock_cpu_hotplug() calls for 2.6.18.
