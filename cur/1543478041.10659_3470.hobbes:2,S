Yes. You are obviously right. Anyway we have to claim strongly that there
is a Linux Develompent Team because we can tell the masses that there is
at least a team that may address their problems with Linux (not counting
that every linux distributor have its own helpdesk).

Look at KDE ! I'm using it and I think its interface is really cool.
I use StarOffice too.
And for how distribution vendors are presenting their X11 installations,
look at the news on the kde page (www.kde.org). KDE is standard alredy on
some distributions.
The above claims seems to me perfectly true.

Okay. Who have told us about 17% ? Who is the analist (I was just using a
number seen on the list in some previous posting).
