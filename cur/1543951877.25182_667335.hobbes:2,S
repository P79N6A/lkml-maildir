While I admit you have a point, I think it's easier to change the name
of that field than changing the hardware documentation at this point ;)

I know.

I'm not saying it's the wrong thing to do. I just think it's strange
that you alter a different register than the one you saved.

Yes, I do think we can assume VAL stays unchanged during suspend.

Yes, that looks better. Perhaps you used a contrast value that happened
to set the right bits when written to CTR?
I still think the name of the saved_lcdcon field is confusing though.
