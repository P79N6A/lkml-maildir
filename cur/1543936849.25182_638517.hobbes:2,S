Not if I do it the same way as for memory hotplug:
1) definee a "namespace event notifier"
2) insert another notifier block into the ipc namespace.
3) The callback routines in the notifier chain would be activated upon 
namespace creation / removal.
But I'm still thinking about it: Matt Helsley suggested that we might 
just copy the old namespace's value when creating a new namespace.
There's also the issue of an msgmni that has been changed via procfs: 
may be we should not unconditionally recompute it upon namespace 
creation / removal, so unregister the callback for the owning namespace 
as soon as msgmni has been changed from userspace.
