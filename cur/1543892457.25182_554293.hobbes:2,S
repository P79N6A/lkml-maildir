BTW an unrelated/happy side-effect of the patch is that it removes
the zero-size-guilty kmalloc()'s from the mtrr code. -mm does have
some fixes that prevent those zero-size allocations, which could
likely be retired if this gets merged in? ...
[ On another unrelated note, could someone tell me who maintains
i386? I've looked around, but surprisingly can't seem to find
anybody listed anywhere. ]
