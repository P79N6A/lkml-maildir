Just a small pointer which might help, when looking at the cvslog of any
file in the bkcvs repository:
RCS file: /home/cvs/linux-2.5/Makefile,v
Working file: Makefile
head: 1.376
branch:
locks: strict
access list:
symbolic names:
        found: 1.376
        not: 1.376
        command: 1.376
        v2_5_70: 1.356
[...]
So it seems something is b0rken wrt tagging...
Otherwise it's a mighty fine service, thanks a lot for providing it.
Bye,
