My grep is fine.  It's the brain which failed ;)

Well it doesn't fit.  With the proposals which we are discussing here, ext2
(and, we hope, soon ext3) would continue to use foo[NR_CPUS].

kmalloc_per_cpu() is useful at present.  But with Rusty's patch it becomes
less useful.
Aside: I rather think that 4000 filesystems isn't sane.  4000 disks is, but I
find it hard to believe that people will have a separate fs on each one...

How about we leave kmalloc_per_cpu as-is (it uses kmalloc()), and only apply
Rusty's new code to DEFINE_PER_CPU?
