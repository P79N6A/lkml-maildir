   I've attached a patch, checking for headroom first, and - if necessary -
   reallocating a larger buffer for the skb_push.
   Please check and apply - or find a better fix!
Here is my "better fix". In pppoatm, we should be increasing the
device header length appropriately.  ie. dev->hard_header_len needs to
be increased in the pppoatm driver when vc-encaps is used.
Franks a lot,
