	I don't think so, I have an almost all 2.1 system and have the 
same problem, although it may be related to C++ libraries, as I've only found
it on programs linked against libstdc++. Two of examples of this kind of 
segfaults are the kde/qt programs (many of them) and x11amp (latest CVS)

	Talking about new kernels in general I must say that they are 
pretty stable (I have a 2.2.3-ac1 up for more than a week with heavy 
using, lots of modules and lots of insmod/rmmod - I need a SCSI ZIP :-)
