How much 'not very good' is the performance? I'm considering buying an
Sharp Actius MM10 notebook, and so far I wasn't able to find ANY numbers
on how fast a 1GHz Crusoe actually is, nevermind with Linux running on
it ... and how much running Linux affects the expected battery life.
Can you share your experience?
