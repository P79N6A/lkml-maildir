earlier processors such as ARM2 and ARM3 (8MHz and up to 35MHz
respectively) can't support unaligned load/store.  they don't trap,
they just silently exhibit some interesting behaviour :-)
I thought we had {get,put}_unaligned() macros so that people could
write handlers for these protocols?  Not that I think support for weird
protocols is a high-priority matter for machines which are limited to
16MB of RAM.
