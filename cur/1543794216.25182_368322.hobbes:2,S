The latest version of my report which measures the latency of
user-space processes running on Linux via a hardware device is
available. This report measures the latency of the 2.6.14.2 kernel and
compares it to a 2.6.14.2 kernel with Ingo's -rt12 patches.

You'll probably just want to skip to the results of the high-load scenario here:

The graphs include: latency measurements, max latency, min latency,
loadavg, and a measure of processor busyness. A separate histogram
indicates measurement distribution.
