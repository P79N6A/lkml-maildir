AFAIK, these are the remaining issues:
Supported timers are ACPI PM timer and TSC timer. No support for
CONFIG_HPET yet. Anybody feel like adding the HPET support? I don't
have any machines with HPET.
Lost tick code is currently disabled with #ifndef CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ
in timer_pm.c and timer_tsc.c. This should be done based on some
variable instead.
Kconfig option DYN_TICK_USE_APIC should be converted to a command
line option, as it only seems to work on P3 and not on P4.
So actually let's say the basic functionality is still missing
some parts :) But these should be pretty easy to fix.
