    Hi Maurice :)

    I've reproduced all your steps and my ramdisk didn't get
corrupted. See below.
>I do the following to setup a ram disk on /dev/ram0...
>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=4096

    Identical commands issued...

    Mine is OK. The lost+found is there. I don't suffer any of the
other problems you tell, neither.
    Maybe you have bad ram chips, or a damaged mke2fs (unlikely), but
the kernel seems to work OK. I've tested with 2.4.18 and 2.4.17.
