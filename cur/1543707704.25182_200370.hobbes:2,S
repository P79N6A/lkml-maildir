Thanks for looking them over! Patch 4 should not actually cause a 
problem, since this is actually one of the bigger changes introduced in 
the 2.00.9 patch. I think it was 2.00.9 anyway, just guessing from the 
changelogs, in any case it is definitely one of the "more widespread" 
changes between 2.00.3 and 2.10.1, which is the current 2.4 driver. The 
bigger problem is probably going to be patch 5, and the follow ons from 
it, since that factors out more common code between the /proc and /sys 
filesystems, which also results in smaller "common chunks" between the 
two drivers.
My plan at the moment is to pull forward all of the changes from the 
2.10.1 driver, and then to go back and add more sysfs support on top of 
what is there now.
Cheers,
Paul
