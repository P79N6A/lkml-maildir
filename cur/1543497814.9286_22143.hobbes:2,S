When you install RedHat 5.1 and above on machines with only 8MB memory, you
will meet some problems if you have no luck.
The problem I usually meet is that when formating ext2 filesystems, the
installer locks . There are 3 ways to pass it:
1. Install the second time ( it will pass happily )
2. Add memory
3. Unmount the disk, attach it to a machine with 16M memory, install, unmount
   the disk, remount it on the bad machine.
