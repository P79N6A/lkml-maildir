Following a git-bisect howto[0], I tried to revert this commit:
# git checkout master
# git revert 051e7cd44ab8f0f7c2958371485b4a1ff64a8d1b
Auto-merged fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_file.c

Auto-merged fs/xfs/xfs_vnodeops.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in fs/xfs/xfs_vnodeops.c
Automatic revert failed.  After resolving the conflicts,
mark the corrected paths with 'git add <paths>' and commit the result.
Any ideas?
