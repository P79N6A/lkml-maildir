That was my original intention, however section 4, question 1 in the FAQ 
states:
"If your patch is on the large size (say larger than 500 lines) consider 
posting a URL pointing to the patch along with the patch description, 
instead of the whole patch."
This patch was 1300+ lines.

Sure, it makes sense... I just wanted to get this driver out since the 
2.4 tree has some architectural features that 2.6 doesn't have yet... 
I'm not sure how those features made it to 2.4 before 2.6 though!...
