Subject: [PATCH] Machine Check Exception thinko.

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
 The values printed by the bluesmoke exception handler are bogus.
We're printing the address twice, instead of the address + the misc
register as the intel spec defines. (I guess the reports we've had
where the two values reported differing are down to the CPU being
in a sorry state).
I'm surprised I didn't notice this whilst doing my recent
'use the MSR #defines' diff, and thought for a second I had introduced it
with that patch, but I checked, and this bug existed before I did that,
I just 'reimplemented' it.
If this patch is correct, and I'm not missing something here, all
previously hand-decoded reports on Linux-kernel have been incorrect.
(oops!)
As a side-note, I'm interested in any dumped Machine Check Exception logs,
as I've started a tool to parse these into plaintext, and the more real
world test cases the better.
Patch below.
regards,
Dave.
