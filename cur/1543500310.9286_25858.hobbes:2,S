Hey, don't look at the Quake support we already have.

Don't guess. The "Microsoft Word file format" is actually a highly
structured compound document format. It doesn't work like TeX.
It is a somewhat like a filesystem inside, complete with some sort
of namespace and block allocation.
One need not understand the Word-specific aspects of the format.
Forget about bold text and image format details. Not even NT would
have all that in the kernel. No, this is only a filesystem-like
structure to be dished out in pieces by a simple driver.

The whole point of this is performance. We wouldn't even be discussing
this if traditional compound document files were adequate.
Consider a 1200 MB document composed of text, images, charts, and
other data. (perhaps a book manuscript with map data) The author
makes a change to an internal component... now what? You need to
reallocate the space it uses. You might need to move hundreds of
megabytes of data (bad), leave a HUGE hole (bad), or add a layer
of indirection (bad). Whatever you do, performance will be bad.
Compare this to the multi-forked file solution: destroy one fork
and create another. Since the OS already has a layer of indirection
for block allocation, you don't suffer any additional performance
loss beyond that of using a filesystem.
