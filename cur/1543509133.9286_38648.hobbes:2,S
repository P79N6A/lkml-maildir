   Hello.
 I am trying to find the right way to find the network
device that should receive the packet (based on the destination 
IP in the packet).
The code works from kernel module, so basically all I
have is sk_buf  and no access to kernel variables.
If would help me a lot if I knew how to get routing
information from the kernel (something like the
info displayed in /proc/net/route), or, even better,
how to get the device * or device name of the
device that is supposed to receive the packet.
 Thank you
 Roman
