Your pci express hotplug controller does not support the proper hotplug
capabilities.  It's probably a bios issue as Windows doesn't support
this just yet (I think Vista now does), so those functions were usually
never tested.
You should be able to just ignore them, unless you want to use your pci
express hotplug functionality.  What kind of hardware is this, a laptop
with expresscard?  Or something else?
