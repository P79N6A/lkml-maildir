Yes, that's true, my idea on how to do that was completely broken, so 
we're basically back to the old way.
BTW: That also means that your and everybody's vmlinux.lds.S does *not* 
need adapting.
I'll take a look on how to do sparc's btfixup in a similar way, without 
messing up the common code too much. BTW, the combination kallsyms +
btfixup, does that need a particular ordering?
