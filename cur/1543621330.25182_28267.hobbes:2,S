I wish.  The only info source we have is their latest GPL'd driver.
It's coming along slowly at the moment... I haven't had time to mess
with it for a few months, and I not DaveM was originally supposed to be
filling in the rx/tx dma stuff, and h/w init.  DaveM jumped in recently
and played a bit with the h/w init stage.
My guess is maybe another month or two until others can play with
"tg3"...
