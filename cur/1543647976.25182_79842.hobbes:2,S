I just wish logical volume management in general had not been so
abandoned in mainline in the first place. I'm not saying Linus unfairly
excluded patches, and I'm not saying patches weren't available. I'm just
saying the dynamics of Linus and the maintainers did not allow for a
healthy LVM in mainline, resulting in decay.
If LVM1's destiny was to die during 2.5, then I wish there would have
been a replacement ready during 2.5's lifecycle. Otherwise, keep
creaking along with what's there, and fix it.
The larger question of volume management should have been addressed
before this whole mess happened. It really was, but LVM1 maintenance was
somewhat abandoned in favor of device mapper, and now it's broken, and
the holy wars are upon us again because many are in fear of losing
functionality important to them (at least the ubiquitous nature of the
functonality), and there is panic.

I look forward to it. In spite of my personal goals on this, I do
appreciate your pickiness.

I just wish there were less veto-esque ways to handle EVMS in *-stable.
