"mot responding" is just a typo, I had to type all the messages from screen
;-)
I already tried pinging, works in both directions. On the server I start
portmap now with 'portmap -v' and I am able to see the requests from the client:
'connect from 192.168.0.87 to getport(nsf)'
'connect from 192.168.0.87 to getport(mountd)'
I also see some messages from Portmap which look like this:
'connect from 192.168.0.87 to dump()'
I also have to note that I have 2 NICs in this server, one with adress
153.95.240.x and one with 192.168.0.x.
Problems seem to occur only on the 192.168.0.x network (I already
interchanged adresses between cards, no effect).
BTW: Is there a newer version of portmap than 5.1 ? I wonder if this is
maybe related to portmap ...
Regards,
Marco
