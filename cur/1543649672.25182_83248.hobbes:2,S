It's an excellent question.

Yup.  If the kernel cannot write back your MAP_SHARED page due to
ENOSPC it throws your data away.
The alternative would be to allow you to pin an arbitrary amount of
unpageable memory.
A few fixes have been discussed.  One way would be to allocate
the space for the page when it is first faulted into reality and
deliver SIGBUS if backing store for it could not be allocated.

Ayup.  MAP_SHARED is a crock.  If you want to write to a file, use write().
View MAP_SHARED as a tool by which separate processes can attach
to some shared memory which is identified by the filesystem namespace.
It's not a very good way of performing I/O.
That's not to say that you deserve to have the kernel silently throw
your data away as punishment for having used it though.  Thanks for the
prod.  We should do something about that.
