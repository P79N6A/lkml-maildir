Well no duh.  I think most of the 4-year-olds I know could have told  
you that.  What sense does it make to give a spy all sorts of fancy  
electronic listening and monitoring equipment and then rely on the  
physical security of your average Dell?  You _can_ make a laptop  
sufficiently secure that its data is encrypted and it cannot be  
physically compromised to install a hardware keylogger without  
virtually destroying the enclosure, but that's completely unnecessary  
for 99.99999% of the users on the planet.
We would be much better off if all the companies getting their data  
stolen out from under them on company laptops would just use basic  
drive encryption and implement basic physical-security training.   
*THAT* is where protecting the laptop is easy; all the bullcrap about  
foreign intelligence is just drawing focus off of how easy it is to  
achieve *adequate* physical protection where it matters.
 From a practical standpoint, an identity thief trying to determine  
which company to attack will just steal a few laptops from a company  
which doesn't encrypt them instead of going through all the very  
risky steps of trying to break into the laptops of one that does.
Of course, this also relies on being able to teach the stupid lusers  
with the laptops not to give their boot password to the "service tech  
on the phone"

Yes I did and I wanted to make it *really* clear that with average  
hardware you can properly protect against virtually all of the  
*common* attack vectors.  The pretty standard problems of "somebody  
stole the company laptop with a bunch of credit-card info on it" or  
"my personal financial data was on the laptop I left in the airport",  
are pretty easy to make safe.  Furthermore, that is *EXACTLY* the  
initial example I gave (my laptop with my personal data on it).
On the other hand, I made this point in my original email, so if this  
is what you were arguing about you've been preaching to the choir.
