Very scary.
device_power_up() calls sysdev_resume _before_ it enables interrupts so it 
sounds like something else has - very incorrectly - enabled interrupts too 
early in your resume sequence. 
The patch that Andrew sent out and that apparently fixed things for you 
should absolutely not have made any difference. This is suspend_enter():
	        arch_suspend_disable_irqs();
	        BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());
	        if ((error = device_power_down(PMSG_SUSPEND))) {
	                printk(KERN_ERR "PM: Some devices failed to power down\n");
	                goto Done;
	        }
	
	        if (!suspend_test(TEST_CORE))
	                error = suspend_ops->enter(state);
	        device_power_up(PMSG_RESUME);
	 Done:
	        arch_suspend_enable_irqs();
and notice how the whole thing is surrounded by that 
arch_suspend_disable/enable_irqs().
So it looks like some sysdev driver (device_power_up does the sysdev 
drivers first, so it can't be the regular low-level PCI drivers) is 
enabling interrupts in its resume function. Scary and very wrong.
It could easily be ACPI, of course. There was some other case where ACPI 
did that, iirc.
