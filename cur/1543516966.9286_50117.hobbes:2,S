(What the heck.. let's see if I understand the basic problem or not)
The way I see it, the ramdisk used to work by making it's data persistent
in the buffer cache.  Today, data doesn't live in the buffer cache, it
lives in the page cache.  Ergo, the task at hand is to figure out how
to make data in the page cache persistent rather than copying that data
back and forth.
Dear World: please advise if dead wrong ;-)
