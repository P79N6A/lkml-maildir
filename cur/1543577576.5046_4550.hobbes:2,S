Both net/sysctl_net.c and net/unix/sysctl_net_unix.c register the
unix_table[] structure which contains the "max_dgram_qlen" file.
It should only be registered once.
Since Unix sockets can be modular, I'm guessing that the one in
net/sysctl_net.c is wrong.  The easy way to get rid of it is to
remove the code between #ifdef CONFIG_UNIX and #endif in that file.
However, I leave it up to DaveM to supply the official patch since
this may not be his preferred method of fixing the problem.
