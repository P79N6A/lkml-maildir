This would reflect the Microsoft way of programming:
If there's a bug in the system, don't fix it, but upgrade your hardware.
Why do you think the requirements for Windows is so great?
Most of their code is very inefficient. I'm sure they programmed
their kernel in Visual Basic. The worst part is that they get
paid to do this! I program in Linux because I don't want to be
associated with that mindset that made Microsoft such a [fill in the blank].
As for the 2.4 VM problem, what are you doing with your machine that's
making it use up so much memory? I have several processes running
on mine all the time, including a slew in X, and I have yet to see
significant swap activity.

P.S. My faithful Timex Sinclair from the 80's never had swap :-)
