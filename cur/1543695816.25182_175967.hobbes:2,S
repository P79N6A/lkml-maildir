Well, I've got it (alsa) all compiled in without any luck.  But, I 
haven't deleted/commented out, any of the rather voluminous oss "shut 
this off and shut that off" lines in my modules.conf either.
Some of the tutorials in those links would seem to indicate that 
/etc/modules.conf has been renamed, which I have not, and my modutils 
are still the same as I've been using for a few months with 2.4.  I 
saw an announcement regarding a new modutils tool set last night, do 
I need to install that, and does that then fubar a 2.4.23-pre8 boot?
