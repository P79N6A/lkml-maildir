So, complete() is not-arch dependent because spinlocks are "good" in all
architectures? complete() ends with spin_unlock_irqrestore() so it
cannot be any better than spinlocks, until there is some hidden magic.
Let me clarify this. Suppose there is some obscure architecture that
maintains in spinlocks some additional data for debugging. Then,
complete_and_exit()->complete()->spin_unlock_irqrestore() 
"wakes up" thread on another CPU and proceeds to access spin-lock data
(to check/update debugging information, for example), but by this time
woken up thread manages to unload module and to un-map page containing
spin-lock data.
