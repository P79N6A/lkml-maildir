Solaris build makes sure files passes a "lint" test during the build and
nothing can be checked in until such a test can pass.
Would it make sense to add such a test during kernel compile for Linux?
Something that could be turned off if somebody needed really fast
builds.  This would check for things like whitespace violations and
other things that violate CodingStyle.
People tend to fix things quick if they break the build.
