1. A problem is o_direct is broken and/or confused with
    file systems.  There is a misguided micro-optimization
    that requires page alignment and sector alignment and
    size.  Even if broken DMA or controllers require these,
    O_DIRECT need not.  O_DIRECT is about the cache.
2. Even when O_DIRECT requires a bounce buffer, it need
    not wipe memory, it could easily confine itself to 1-4
    buffers and even support read ahead.  Then DVDs could
    be mounted O_DIRECT by default.
3. Buffer management has become a DOS on Linux leaving
    disk bound programs with the disk light off for ten
    seconds at a crack.  Writing is worst of all.
