Where does the boot hang?  If it comaplains about not being able to
open /dev/console or some other device node, it may be that your /dev
has no nodes in it.  This happened to me when I eradicated devfs (I
got fed up of fighting with devfsd to get my permission changes to
stick, and had reshuffled FSes in the meantime) and so I booted from a
rescue disk, mounted my root FS and recreated the device nodes in
/mnt/dev.
