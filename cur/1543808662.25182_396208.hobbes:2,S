Ok. That's what I was afraid of. If this isn't your root file system, you
can clear the attributes with reiserfsck --clean-attributes <device>, and
it will fix the problem.
Unfortunately, this is hardly a solution, since this is a change that causes
unexpected and unpredictable results on file systems in use.
Andrew -
Since the attr-bits-cleared bit can't be trusted, I don't think we'll ever be
able to enable reiserfs inode attrs by default. I'll send a patch separately
to back out this behavior.
