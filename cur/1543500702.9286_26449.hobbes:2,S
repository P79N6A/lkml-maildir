No.  The kernel is a "whole" work.  The kernel is GPL, and as
such, any smaller part of it is also GPL.  I think what you
_really_ meant to say is that the kernel has code in it of which
*THE ORIGINAL* code was not GPL.
Any source code, regardless of it's original license, if brought
into any GPL'd source code project, _becomes_ automatically
itself GPL.  This assumes that the original license and the GPL
are compatible however, such as the BSD license.  As such, the
code borrowed from a BSD licenced source once incorporated into a
GPL licenced source, is now GPL itself, and cannot be removed
from GPL unless dually licenced and all authors of the GPL'd work
as a whole all agree on the dual licensing.
