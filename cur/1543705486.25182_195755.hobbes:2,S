Looks like we're setting up IRQ9 correctly -- level/low -- which is what
default/default is.  Other systems break if dfl/dfl is not interpreted
as level/low.

But ACPI (alone on the IRQ) is getting an interrupt storm -- IRQ9 is low
and ACPI doesn't know why.
Please verify that you've got the latest BIOS for this box,
and send along
1. /proc/interrupts and demsg from booting same kernel with "acpi=off"
2. output from dmidecode available in /usr/sbin/, or here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
i'll send a patch later to force IRQ9 to level/high -- for if the ACPI
interrupt works properly with that setting, then we know we've
mis-interpreted what we think should be dfl/dfl on this box.
thanks,
