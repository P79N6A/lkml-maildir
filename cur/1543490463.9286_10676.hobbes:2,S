The patch looks fine, but I wonder..
I don't think we should move a buffer to the unused list without making
damn sure that it doesn't have any IO active on it. 
I'll apply it anyway, because it _is_ obviously cleaner (the old code was
meant to handle the case where the buffer might still be shared with some
MM mapping - something that can't happen any more), and I /think/ it's
actually harmless even if we have some old active write to the buffer, but
it still makes me worry.
Stephen, would you mind thinking about this for five minutes? I wonder if
it shouldn't look something like this:
	if (bh->b_count == 1) {
		forget();
	} else { 
		brelse();
	}
to be truly safe. Comments?
