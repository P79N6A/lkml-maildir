Correct, because adjustable tab width is a myth. The comments don't
line up when you muck with tab width.

1. put your head in a PET scanner
2. think about Pascal while the doctors observe
3. get radiation treatment to kill neurons infected with Pascal

I get 30 to 60 lines on my monitors, but I want over 200 lines.
Such a monitor would be at least $6000, assuming I could find one.
(fuzzy text doesn't count)

Agreed, but braces are not the fix.

The gcc computed goto extension is better, because it doesn't suffer
the overhead of that stupid built-in default. We need __raw_switch
to overcome this. If I leave out the default and pass in bogus values
then I should get a crash. (this is about performance)

I'm still looking for a readable description of C99 aliasing rules
and proper usage of "restrict". It is no wonder that schools are
switching to Java.
