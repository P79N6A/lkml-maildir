	An excellent point.  Perhaps a config option?

	Perhaps a new module for linuxconf.  A user might be able to use said new
module in the place of the make menuconfig ( or xconfig, etc ).  Also - the
possibility to do remote recompiles would then exist ( via linuxconf's remote
usages.) 
	Now that might or might not be a good thing :)
