The aggregation happens at the task struct when you apply different
pieces to a task we don't need a structure to allow aggregation.

No. A reverse mapping is not needed and is not interesting.
As long as I can walk all processes and ask what namespace are
you in I don't care.

To me at least the interesting part of your work is not the aggregation
portion.  But the infrastructure for building the different process
groups.
You seem to be calling your groups of processes lumped together for
one purpose or another a container.

As we have previously been using the term container is like
application.  The end product that the user sees built out of
individual kernel provided components, but not something that exists
in the kernel as such.
We need a term for the non-aggregated case for the individual process
groups we build this out of in your infrastructure.  Because you
clearly have more than one kind of process group a set of processes
can belong to.

I don't need to integrate with it to get access to the resource
controller work.  The resource controller work applies to a set of
processes.  I have a set of processes.  I just need to apply the
resource controllers to my set of processes.
At least when we don't talk about the names for these things it
is that simple.  Now global names I have issues with because almost
always the global names fall into their own category, but that is
a different story.
Now I have some half backed ideas that might be useful for providing
a better abstraction.  But it requires setting down and looking
at the problem in detail, and understanding what people are trying
to accomplish with these things they are building.  What subset of
process groups do you find interesting.
All that is necessary to have a group of processes do something
in an unnamed fashion is to hang a pointer off of the task_struct.
That's easy.  You are adding a lot more to that, and there is
enough abstraction I haven't been able to easily work my way through
the infrastructure to what is really going on.  Admittedly I haven't
looked closely yet.
