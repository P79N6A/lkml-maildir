Well, all I did was basically an early vmalloc kind of thing.
You only need to allocate enough virtual space for how much memory
you actually *have*, not the full set. The problem on i386 is that
you just need to reserve that space early, in order to shuffle
everything else into fit. It's messy, but not hard.
