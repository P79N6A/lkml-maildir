Subject: Kernel 2.4.x freezes on boot

As the subject indicates, I'm having trouble running 2.4.x kernels.  I've 
tried 2.4.10 and 2.4.13, and both of them compile perfectly (no errors) but 
when I insert them into LILO and reboot I get the following:
LILO:  Linux
Loading Linux........
and the computer freezes at this point, every time.  I've tried compiling 
it for PIII/Celeron Coppermine (which is the correct one for me I think) 
and 386.  I've compiled the kernel under Debian GNU/Linux 2.2r3 (kernel 
2.2.19) with GCC 2.91.66.
My computer's basic hardware specs are:
CPU = Celeron 566
RAM = 256MB PC100 SDRAM
M/B = Gigabyte GA6VXE7+
IDE = 	hda = primary hard disk (windows and MBR here)
	hdb = cd-rw
	hdc = secondry hard disk (linux root & swap partitions live here)
	hdd = cd-rom
I've been tearing my hair out over this for about a fortnight now.  I'd 
provide more debugging info, but the computer doesn't give any because it 
freezes so early.  I am probably just forgetting to do something important, 
as this is the first time I've ever tried to compile my own kernel.  Any 
pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
