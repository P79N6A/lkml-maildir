note that for soem workloads the _dependant reads_ can have _dependant
writes_ in between. I know it's not the most common case though, but I
don't love too much to make reads that much special. But again, it makes
perfect sense to have it as a feature, but I wouldn't like it to be only
option, I mean there must always be a way to disable anticipatory
scheduling like there must be a way to disable SFQ (infact for SFQ it
makes sense to leave it disabled by default, it's only a few people that
definitely only cares to have the lowest possible latency for mplayer or
xmms, or for multiuser system doing lots of I/O, but those guys can't
live without it)
