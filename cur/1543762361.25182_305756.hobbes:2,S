I've thought about this too, and came up with the conclusion that this was
too messy.  You have to give up the information of the processes that are
waiting on the lock when you release it. Or keep the information of the
waiters (waking only one "the wakee") but then you have a lock with
waiters and no owner, which is the messy part.
On an SMP machine, there may even be a chance of a lower priority process
that gets it. That would be possible if the low priority process on the
other CPU tries to grab the lock just after it was released but before
the just woken up high priorty processes get scheduled. So there's a
window where the lock is open, and the lower priority process snagged it
just before the others got in.

Darn! It seemed like fun to implement. I may do it myself anyway on my
kernel just to understand your implementation even better.
