I haven't said that it has been widely/wrongly removed...

Is there something specific to ARM in this implementation ? I don't think
so and it's surely the reason why MIPS did copy it with almost no changes.
I understand that ARM implementation has been the first one but maybe now
why not making it the common power management for embedded system that
could be used by all arches which need it ?
BTW, why has apm_cpu_idle() logic been removed from ARM implementation ?

BTW why is it still called "APM" on ARM ?
