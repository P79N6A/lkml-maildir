This patch only inherits the basic conditionals for integrating with 
PREEMPT_RT from a recent Adeos combo experimenting the issue w/ 
0.7.44-03, but there is indeed more to do for completing the integration 
with recent PREEMPT_RT patches.

local_irq_disable for the root domain. Thanks for the hint.
