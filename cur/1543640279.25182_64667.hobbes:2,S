Why don't we just start with the now-discarded 2.5 IDE code as IDE-TNG?
If people want to develop/hack then they can use that, and if they
want to hack on other things they use the old code.  You just need to
make the two config options mutually exclusive until the drivers learn
to play well together (by being able to control separate drives/ctrlr).
