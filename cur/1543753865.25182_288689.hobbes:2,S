Yes.  As soon as 32bit app touches sysenter page (execution, read, whatever),
it is loaded to the processor's TLB, and as page is marked global it is not
flushed when kernel switches address space to another app - like 64bit
one.  Fortunately TLB is not that big, so for most of real-world workloads
you'll not notice, but if you are doing context switches really often,
sooner or later you'll hit vsyscall page instead of data page your process
has mapped, and bad things happen.
To get your app (or any other 64bit app...) to work reliably on unpatched
kernels you should mmap one page at 0xffffe000 and forget about that page
forever...
