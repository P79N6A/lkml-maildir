Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Export cpu info by sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I worked out 2 patches to export cpu topology and cache info by sysfs.
The first patch is to export cpu topology info including below items
(attributes) which are similar to /proc/cpuinfo.
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/physical_package_id(representing
the physical package id of  cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_id (representing the cpu core
id  to cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/thread_id (representing the cpu
thread id  to cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/thread_siblings (representing the
thread siblings to cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_siblings (represeting the
core siblings to cpu X)
