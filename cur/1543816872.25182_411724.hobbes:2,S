[PATCH] Janitor: drivers/net/pcnet32: fix incorrect comments
The comments concerning how the pcnet32 ethernet device driver selects 
the MAC addr to use are incorrect. A recent patch (in the last 3 months)
changed how the code worked, but did not change the comments.
Side comment: the new behaviour is good; I've got a pcnet32 card which
powers up with garbage in the CSR's, and a good MAC addr in the PROM.
