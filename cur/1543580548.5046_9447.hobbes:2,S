I for one dont use the KT7 motherboards    but i know from experience that
increasing the FSB only effects ram speed ( at least negatively anyway)  i have
100Mhz ram and 133Mhz ram so once i'm at 114Mhz the 100Mhz ram cant handle too much
more ..   so 114Mhz is what i stay at.   My PCI clock is not changed at all and so
far (for the last couple days) the hdd's on my idebus have not had any problems what
so ever.   Sorry but i've only got UDMA66 drives and idebus is whatever the 2.2.x
kernel defaults to.    I'm guessing any sort of corruption caused by 2.4.x had
something to do with that dirty page writes mail that was sent to the list a while
ago and was probably fixed but never made it to the changelog.     I'll stick to 2.2
until 2.5 though just in case.    What would be interesting is figuring out why the
kernel can't recover somehow from infinite ide irq reset loops which are usually
brought on by dma timeouts.   That would at least somewhat usefull for when they
actually happen (I saw them numerous times in 2.4.x but not since going back to
2.2.x).
