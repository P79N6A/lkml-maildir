Thanks for that, lots of little things like this were undoubtably
missed, we use u/s# in other areas. Changed and will be resent after
all comments are in.

No reason? I think we've had this comment before, not sure if we have
had a decent reason though... let me see if I can find out why we do
it this way.

I believe this is an old and lingering comment. While I don't know who
originated, it sounds like a question to Michael Halcrow regarding
locking of a struct file's private data... It will be removed for next
submission.

I find them make the code a bit more clear. Then again, I understand
what they do and use them a lot, so I am clearly jaded. You are the
first person to comment on these wrappers (all previous comments where
regarding some debug wrappers we had in when we first submitted, I
like those ones too, but I guess my opinion doesn't carry enough
weight here ;P) There is no functional reason why these can't be
removed, but like I said, I think they make the code a lot easier to
read once you know all they do is sugar-coat a potentially long, and
potentially confusing, chain of refences, and turn that into some
phrase-like macro.

Ah ha, that should read ecryptfs_virt_to_scatterlist. Again, will be
changed for next submission. While reviewing the code, there seem to
be a few more like this. I'll make sure they get updated.
