I'm looking at the new Cryptographic options that were merged into this
kernel, and don't see any options for "crytoloop" mounting of encrypted
files as loop-back filesytems like the ones that I've been using in the
CryptoAPI patches.  
Are any additional patches needed for this, and if so, are there plans
to merge them at any point?  These seem focused mostly on IPsec from
what I can tell, hence my confusion, and the CryptoAPI patches
obviously don't patch in cleanly anymore.
Thanks in advance for the help!
Matt Hartley
