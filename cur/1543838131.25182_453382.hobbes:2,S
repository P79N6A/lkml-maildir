Thats valid.

Thats not.  Theres no assignment at the start of the function;
theres one inside the main body of the loop 20+ lines into it,
and right after a mem alloc with flags requiring no failure.
Later that local variable is freed then set to NULL inside the
loop, before continuing the next iteration...
Really this code would be better if reworked slightly to just
allocate nmp once before entering the loop, and then free it
once at the end... we wouldn't need a goto, just a few breaks
in the loop and a conditional transaction cancel.

Hmm, seems like code churn that makes the code slightly less
obvious, but thats just me... I'd prefer a tested patch that
implements the above suggestion, to be honest. :)
cheers.
