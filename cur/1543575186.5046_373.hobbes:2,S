Whoever posted this on Slashdot is smoking some killer dope or
something.  The Windows API is very well documented via online docs from
MSDN -- better than most software anywhere in the world.   Whoever said
this was high or something or ignorant or never had an MSDN
subscription.  I used to get 20-40 CD's a month from MS on a Universal
Subscription, with enormous documentation..
