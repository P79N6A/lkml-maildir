create_proc_entry() passes &parent to proc_create().
See proc_create():
...
This is an error path:
	if (!(*parent) && xlate_proc_name(name, parent, &fn) != 0)
		goto out;
but xlate_proc_name() searches for a /proc/.... and returns the 
all-but-final-part-of-name *parent (hope that makes some sense,
see the comments above the function), so it returns &proc_root.
HTH.  If not, fire back.
