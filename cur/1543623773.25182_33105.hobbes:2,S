So it can return NULL?

Process A needs 4 pages, Process B needs 4 pages, each grabs 3.
One easy, traditional unix algorithm for dealing with this is
	for(i=0; i < 4; i++)if !(p[i]=kmallloc(...))
                                free all that we have so far

Really? I thought LRUs were to approximate working sets. Obviously
if a program is kmallocing its working set is changing but that
does not tell us anything about whether it is a correct decision to
rip a page from the working set of another process.

I'm too dumb to come up with a solution here, but you are the one
changing the interface, so surely you have a couple of "less borked"
solutions in mind - right?
