Except that this is not about a driver that is supposed to interoperated
with the kernels people already have on their systems. This is about
shipping new (embedded) systems with a modified (if you go the s/_GPL//g
route, even more so) Linux kernel, and distribution a modified kernel *has*
to comply with the GPL, since this is *exactly* what the GPL is about:
redistribution of modified copies of the work.
