I would suspect that whilst you've recompiled the kernel, you either
didn't recompile the modules at the same time, or didn't install then
after doing so...
If so, go to /usr/src/linux (or wherever you put the kernel sources)
and type...
 Q> make modules modules_install
...and that should fix it for you...
Best wishes from Riley.
