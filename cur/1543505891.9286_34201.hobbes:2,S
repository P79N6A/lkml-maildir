Speaking as the person who wrote the net-2debugged code you are talking 
complete and utter crap.
Linus gave them the FPU emu code (old version he wrote).
The stack is original, so stop doing down the work of Ross Biro and Don
Becker. It was done _from scratch_. At the time it looked like *BSD was going
to be killed by the AT&T lawsuit and we already knew the licenses were
incompatible.
Matthais Urlich (whose name I always spell wrong so I will apologise in
advance) ported the BSD Net/2 stack to Linux as a side thing but it was
never part of Linux proper
