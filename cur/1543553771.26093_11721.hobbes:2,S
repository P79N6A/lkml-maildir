	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	add_wait_queue(...);
	/* window here */
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule();
If there's a wakeup by another CPU (or this CPU in an interrupt) in
that window, current->state will get switched to TASK_RUNNING.
Then it's immediately overwritten and we go to sleep.  Lost wakeup.
