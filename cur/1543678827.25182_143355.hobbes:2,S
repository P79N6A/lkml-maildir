[reiserfs excised as this is no longer quite on-topic]

Ah. That does sound like either bad RAM or scattershot corruption.

Done that, no problems found. (Most drives are e3fs.)
2.4.21's crashed once more since then, network driver death; I'm
probably going to revert to 2.4.20 on that box, which ran perfectly
since three days past 2.4.20's release. (However, several other boxes
had problems with 2.4.20 which were cleared up with .21... you win some,
you lose some. I'd say this has been a net gain.)
I'll see if 2.4.20 has the same problems; if it does, then I agree, the
RAM's probably had it.
