I've been seen to type 300 chars per minute (5 per second) for around
a minute. The inter-char-time distribution is not flat. That's the way
typing classes like it, but it sure as hell isn't. Some
left-hand-right-hand sequences, end up inverted, meaning that the
fingers moved almost the same moment, ending up reversed. I wouldn't
be surprised that as some end up the wrong order, some inter-char
times are as low as 10 or 20 milliseconds.
My laptop starts eating characters when its battery is low. Highly
irritating. I "feel" what I type, so I almost always KNOW what I
typed, even if it wasn't what I wanted tot type. So even when
blindfolded you will see me backup and correct typing errors.  So
"deafening" the keyboard for a certain time is something I object to:
I expect to be crippled by it, even if it's only 10 or 20 ms.
(Sometimes, the keyboard repeat rate is too slow for me. I then (get
irritated and) start typing the key in quick succession. Usually 
quicker than the repeat rate!)
