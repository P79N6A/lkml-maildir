The machine has been up for 19 hours.  Network load is about 400k per
second on a 10mbps ethernet, fairly light for this network.
The ftp site is an on-campus sight, and we have an FDDI ring, so its not a
network bottleneck, trust me.
As a recap, this is a P2-300 SMP in uni-processor mode, running kernel
v2.2.13.
