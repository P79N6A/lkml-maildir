6110 doesn't work yet. You need a mobile with a built-in hardware modem.
The Ericsson is one of them. Nokia 8110 should work too. If you don't want
to pay the premium, a GSM capable modem like the Xircom Realport or those
from Option work just fine with most mobiles and a cable. I have the
realport and a Nokia 6150, works just great. 
This is off-topic here, tho.
