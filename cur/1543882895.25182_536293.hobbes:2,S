Yes. For laptops, you may want to
 - raise the dirty limits
 - increase the dirty scan times
but you do realize that if you then need memory for something else, 
latency just becomes *horrible*. So even on laptops, it's not obviously 
the right thing to do (these days, throwing money at the problem instead, 
and getting one of the nice new 1.8" flash disks, will solve all issues: 
you'd have no reason to try to delay spinning up the disk anyway).
