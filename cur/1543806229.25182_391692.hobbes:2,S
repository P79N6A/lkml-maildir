Your device directory is usually the best for device specific options.
In your driver directory (for the type of bus driver that your device
lives on) is for driver-wide options.
Not in the module directory, that's not easy to get to and not
recommended at all.  Only module paramaters go there.

The config stuff might be better off in configfs, not sysfs.

Use configfs.

So, lots of files is not a problem, have you looked at the sysfs file
entries for the sensor/hwmon drivers in a while?  There are zillions of
them :)
