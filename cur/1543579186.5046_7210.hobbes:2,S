Hi Urban.
I'm connecting to a Win2K server (same share between computers).  A 
slight change in my previous post:  my dual P2 w/320MB appears to be 
running 2.4.0-ac9 instead of 2.4.1-pre8.  The bigmem machine (1gb mem) 
had the oops on 2.4.0-ac9 but before reporting I thought I'd try 
2.4.1-pre8 and see if it also had the oops.  (This morning the small mem 
machine had a problem but I'll put that in a separate email.)
Earlier I had tried 2.4.0-test12 but it partially scrambled my root 
partition so I went back to 2.2.19-pre2.  After the oops I tried 2.4.0 
straight but when it was booting it decided my root partition had been 
umounted not-cleanly and decided it needed to do lots of icky things to 
my root partition.  I just rebooted it (without letting it do any 
changes) and went back into 2.4.1-pre8 and let it clean up the root 
partition.  So I don't know if 2.4.0 straight would do this (apparently 
it does from other people's reports) since 2.4.0 didn't want to play 
nice on my machine.
Since I can't do without smbfs I guess I'll have to do without bigmem.  
Please let me know when you're ready to test some fixes; I would be glad 
to help testing.
