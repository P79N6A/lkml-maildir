the new ops are a pretty nice and clean solution i think.
Firstly, accessing the current CPU is the only safe shortcut anyway (there 
is where we can do %fs/%gs / rip-relative addressing modes), and the 
generic per_cpu() APIs dont really provide that guarantee for us. We might 
be able to hook into __get_cpu_var() but those both require to be an 
lvalue and are also relatively rarely used.
So introducing the new, rather straightforward APIs and using them 
wherever they matter for performance is good. Your patchset already shaved 
off an instruction from ordinary per_cpu() accesses, so it's all moving 
rather close to the most-optimal situation already.
