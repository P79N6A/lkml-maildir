He is not breaking anything.
Just now linux will happily suspend in the middle of read command, then
wake up, get spurious interrupt, say "I'm happy read finished", and corrupt
data. What's there is first step in getting it right, and more steps are

NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE: unless you are using S3/S4, that change is a NOP. On
2.4.18 you can't use S3/S4, so it is definitely NOP for you. Will not eat
your data.
