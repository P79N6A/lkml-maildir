I'll give this a try.  None of the 2.6.28-rcX versions I've tried have
lasted more than a few hours at best before panicing with a block layer
timeout.  My test system uses the aic7xxx driver with a 2930U2 adapter.
I didn't report the regression relative to 2.6.27 because I figured
something this major was going to get caught without another "me too"
report that I was too busy to generate and provide the necessary
diagnostic and followup on anyway :-).
