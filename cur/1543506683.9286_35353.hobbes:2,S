Hello *,
I am revising my ioctl list (and finally getting to all the allocations that
people have asked me for, too).
I notice that some of the TIOC* serial ioctls have output types that are
different types in different device drivers.  Specifically, the following
ioctls write an 'int' in most drivers, but write a 'long' in a few drivers:
    TIOCINQ TIOCOUTQ
    TIOCMGET TIOCMBIS TIOCMBIC TIOCMSET
    TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    TIOCSERGWILD
Note that this is not a value in a registers, it's a value that the kernel
writes into memory, so it's important that it be the same size for all drivers
-- especially for big-endian architectures.
I would really like to make this consistent soon because more and more
64-bite architectures are coming at us, where this will make a difference.
Because most of the values are 'int', I'd like to standardize on 'int'
return values for most TIOC ioctls.
I plan to write up patches and send them to the appropriate maintainers.
Any feedback?
Michael
