	I beg your pardon, but that is not true.  I volunteered to be
a maintainer of the open-source pwc driver in one of my messages of
the 27th.  Quote:
    So long as someone is available to maintain the closed-source
    codecs (while, we all hope, working in parallel with the manufacturers
    involved to secure open-source licensing for any currently
    closed-source components), I am confident that we can put together
    a team to implement the rest. I would be pleased to be on the team.
	I then submitted an overall design for a revised open-source
driver, and a graceful transition plan.  Please see my message
entitled: "PWC: A Plea for Grace" for details.
	I've discussed some of my proposal for maintenance pf pwc with
Nemosoft offline (apparently, I'm not the only one discussing pwc
maintenance with Nemosoft offline), and received what I believe is a
favorable response.
