Well, I am not entirely sure what confusion it is supposed to cause,
but comments such as this one suggests that there are some known
cases: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/16/213
And in addition, it something that I recall having seen lots of
comments on on LKML, so I just assumed that there is some truth to it.
That is again backed by the circumstantial evidence that many files
actually do place labels at column 1 currently.
(lots of hand waving going on here, I know)
