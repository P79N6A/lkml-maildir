Agreed - we have separate flags.  I want exactly user address space
pages.  You want really easy to reclaim pages.  You have good
performance justifications for your choice.  I have just "design
purity", so if for some reason there was a dire shortage of GFP bits,
I suspect it is I who should give, not you.

Once this is merged with current Linux, which already has GFP_HARDWALL,
I presume you will be back up to 21 bits, code and comment.
As I noted in another message the "USER" and the comment in:
#define __GFP_USER	0x40000u /* User is a userspace user */
are a bit misleading now.  Perhaps GFP_EASYRCLM?
