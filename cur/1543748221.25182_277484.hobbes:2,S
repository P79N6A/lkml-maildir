The simple things, like cache settings and queue depth - definitely. The
harder things like how does this drive behave you cannot. And
unfortunately the former is also pretty easy to control (at least for
the depth) and at least gather at runtime. So I think a user mode helper
only makes sense if it can help you with real drive characteristics that
are hard to detect. Plus, settings have a nack for changing while we
are running as well.
Hmm so perhaps not such a hot idea after all. I don't envision anyone
actually doing it anyways, so...
