Well, it may actually make sense to actually stick the whole "syscall 
table pointer" in there, rather than a flag that says which pointer to 
choose.
We already load the thread_info pointer because we need the flags for 
syscall tracing, and since we have the thread_info pointer, it might be 
easier to load the syscall table pointer right off there, rather than 
loading it as a big constant with "lis + ori" (in fact, on ppc64, we 
currently load it off the TOC, which is really sad, since we already 
brought in the thread_info into the cache, and usign the TOC is not just a 
load, it's a load off a separate cacheline).
So on 64-bit ppc, it could actually speed things up to put the system call 
table pointer into thread_info, and make it more flexible at the same 
time, without any conditional flags.
