OK..  I just ran into the same problem.. it was after I went to a heavy
laden JAVA site.. after that I closed netscape with the mouse and it was
still in the background, I had to resort to a "kill -9 <pid>" to kill it.
It doesn't happen that often.. only when the system has been loaded close
to the maximum for a while.
