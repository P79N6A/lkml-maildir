all it takes for me on Fedora is to boot a modular distro kernel once, 
then copy the /dev to the real (persistent) /dev:
   mkdir /tmp2
   mount /dev/sda1 /tmp2
   cp -a /dev/* /tmp2/dev/
and from that point on a bzImage/vmlinuz can boot up on Fedora without 
any problems (as long as it has the right drivers built in), and the 
initrd line can be removed from grub.conf.
