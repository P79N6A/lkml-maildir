It's mysticism! This error is unpredictable: in 2.6.10 kernel also 
occured but SOMETIMES. The same result on three kernels and on two 
distributives: 2.6.10, 2.6.11 and 2.6.13. I'm in confusion. I also tryed 
to disable all acpi and apm functions but in vain.
With best regards, Nikolay.
P.S. I think that .config and dmesg can't help here.
