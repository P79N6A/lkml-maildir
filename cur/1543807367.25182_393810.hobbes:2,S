Subject: Hugepages need clear_user_highpage() not clear_highpage()

When hugepages are newly allocated to a file in mm/hugetlb.c, we clear
them with a call to clear_highpage() on each of the subpages.  We
should be using clear_user_highpage(): on powerpc, at least,
clear_highpage() doesn't correctly mark the page as icache dirty so if
the page is executed shortly after it's possible to get strange
results.
This is a bugfix and should go into 2.6.16.
