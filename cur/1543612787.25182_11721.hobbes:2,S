Hi,
I've got my laptop's bios set to suspend-to-disk. During a mpg123 
session it suspended and when resumed, I got 2 seconds of audio 
followed by 10 sec silence, followed by
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
The disk light was on and I had to power cycle it.
What gives?
