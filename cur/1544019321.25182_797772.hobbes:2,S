Because if it fails to create the thread, we want to requeue the work
within a delay.

No need to reset it. If it is unshadowed, then the thread was created
and we want to recreate
it on cpu_up(). And if it is shadowed, then we don't need to create it yet.

In my opinion too. I just didn't find a proper way to handler it yet.

I didn't thought about such deadlocks.... :-/

So it should use get_cpu/put_cpu, right?

Yeah, looks like this bit is not a good synchronization solution. Only
a spinlock
can solve this, to synchronize the access to cwq->unshadowed and block it
while we are trying to allocate the work.

Right.

Not sure I understand your point here...unless...if it hasn't been
created yet, the keventd
which was about to do it can have been cleanup... Is that what you are
talking about?
Anyway, yes, this is a race condition.

But the work of task creation is pending on kevent, which works are
not cancelled here.
Anyway you are right, the approach is not good. Even if the races are
fixed, when the caller of a
workqueue holds a lock needed by a work queued before the task
creation on kevent, we have an unfixable
deadlock.
The only solution would be to have a dedicated thread on workqueue to
unshadow the other workqueues. But isn't
it solving the problem of random tasks by creating another one?
Yes and no: create one task to avoid creating several pointless other
one can be a solution.
Hm?
Thanks for your review Oleg!
