Check for the errata on the disk device you are using from the 
manufacturer and see if there are recovery issues with ECC
detection.   I saw a similiar issue with Maxtor drives at one point and 
it turned out to be a bad batch of microcode on the drive
itself with random data errors when ECC was enabled.
