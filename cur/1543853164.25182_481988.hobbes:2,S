Ug. Watch out. Right now the backlight code requires framebuffer to be 
enabled. I seen a patch some time ago by Tony the allowed backlight 
support which I need to integrate. 
P.S
	It would be really nice if the acpi backlight could be exposed to 
the VESA framebuffer or any other driver whos backlight is not 
implemented.
