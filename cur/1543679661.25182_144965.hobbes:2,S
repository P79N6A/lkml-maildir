Hmmm,
how is that supposed to work?  The trick about PPPoA is that the underlying
(logical) structure provides a distinct physical link (like in the modem
world).  The actual ATM cells have no tag that allows the BRAS to sort out which
PPP connection is currently sending packets, so you actually have to have more
than one VC to make this work.
Cheers,
Immanuel
