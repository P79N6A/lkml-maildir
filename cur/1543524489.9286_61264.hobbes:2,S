Huh? How would you split "foobar" without breaking existing systems?

[please read to the end where I complete my explanation]
Nope, this doesn't work. ACLs are tied to UID and are inherited
through the filesystem structure. Capabilities are tied to processes
and are inherited as processes are created. This is very different.
I don't want to let users edit a specific file with user data.
I want to let privileged code verify that a process has the right
to perform restricted actions. The kernel (one chunk of privileged
code) can check for the right to "chown" (one restricted action).
The kernel is not the only privileged code.
So we have one security mechanism for operations that are defined
solely by the kernel, and no good mechanism for those that are not.

Only the kernel can provide correct security inheritance.
The kernel need not actually interpret the bits; they may
instead be defined by the Linux Standard Base or whatever.
This is a very ugly problem; we should not deny it exists.
We need a "capability bit registrar" to allocate the bits.
(just as we need registrars for device numbers, system calls,
a.out library address space, MIME types, etc.)

All of the capability bits address specific problems. :-)

You seem to prefer minimal design over correctness. There is no
way that userspace can provide access control inheritance of the
type offered by capability bits.

That is half of an answer: the DG-UX OS can deny file access to
every process lacking a file-specific capability.

Of course I agree. One may reserve a single capability bit for
the "modify user database" concept, and /bin/chfn may check it.
This is exactly what DG-UX does -- helping to earn a B2/B3 rating.

The whole "in-kernel" distinction is flawed.
With the old system, the kernel would check UID and GID.
With the old system, user-space would check UID and GID.
With the new system, the kernel checks capability bits.
With the new system, user-space... ARRRGH!!!!!
I hope you can see this now. User-space must be able to support
security that is compatible with what the kernel uses. If all
the user-space code must keep using UID and GID, then we are
still suffering from the "privileged UID" problem. We might as
well throw out capabilities then, since they aren't solving the
problem they were designed to solve.
