Hi Andreas,

shmem is only large because the union is large. I introduced the
direct swap array of size SHMEM_NR_DIRECT simply to take advantage of
the union. We can decrease SHMEM_NR_DIRECT very easily. I am thinking
about 1 or 5 which would mean that we allocate an indirect block for
files bigger than 4k or 20k respectively.
The shmem_inode_info would then be 8 or 12 words.
