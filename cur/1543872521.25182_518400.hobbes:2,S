It'll be out of standard as timerfd is, w/out code savings. Look at the 
code and tell me what could be saved. Prolly the ten lines of the timer 
callback. Lines that you'll have to drop inside the current posix timer 
layer. Better leave standards alone, especially like in this case, when 
the savings are not there.
