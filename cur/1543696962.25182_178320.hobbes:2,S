Subject: 2.6.0-test9 /-mm3 SATA siimage - bad disk performance

Hello all,
with the Fedora 1 kernel 2.4.22-1.2115.nptl I get with hdparm -t
(Timing buffered disk reads) 34 MB/sec. Its very slow for this drive.
With 2.6.0-test9 and -mm3 I get around "62 MB in 3.05 = 20,31". Wow"
Back to ~1998?
UDMA6 is always on. The Abit NF7-S V2 nForce2 board with an siimage 
3112a (rev2) raid controller, new BIOS.
Also with the Seagate SATA V ST380023AS I get heavy crashes with 
max_kb_per_request when I set it to 128 (all kernel). With 15kb its fine 
and stable, but so slow.
The Seagate technical support means in an email to me, that there are no 
problems with the SATA seagate drives, its only the driver ... Nice. Is 
that really so? And why get other users with new Maxtor or Western 
Digital SATA drives (in the same class) much better performance?
Thanks for all the good work,
Marcus
