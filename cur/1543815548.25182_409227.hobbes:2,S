Subject: Possible CIFS regression in 2.6.16 (vs 2.6.14)

Having just upgraded from 2.6.14 to 2.6.16, I've discovered that I can
no longer mount an SMB share on my network using cifs as the filesystem.
Mounting with smbfs, however, works happily.
I'm using Samba 3.0.21c.  The share is served by an Iomega Network
Hard Disk and does not require a password.  (Examining the responses
from this thing seems to suggest it's running Samba 2.2.7, which is
quite possibly in violation of the GPL...)  The mount options in use
are: defaults,guest,file_mode=0664,dir_mode=0775,gid=users
Turning on tracing in /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI gives the following
(slightly anonymised):
 fs/cifs/cifsfs.c: Devname: //hostname/NetHDD flags: 64

 CIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -6
Tracing this back to fs/cifs/connect.c seems to suggest that the
relevant difference from 2.6.14 is that the kernel now sends a
hashed password at the start of the smb_command 117, whereas in
the older kernel (and using smbfs) only a null byte is sent for
the password.
I've tried mounting with the sec=none option to turn off password
hashing, but it doesn't seem to make any difference (the request
packet looks about the same in tcpdump as well).
Is there any way to restore the 2.6.14 behaviour, or is this a
bug (or an unimplemented feature) in CIFS?  I'm afraid I don't
know anything much about SMB, but I'm happy to provide any
information which might help in tracking this down.
Thanks in advance...
