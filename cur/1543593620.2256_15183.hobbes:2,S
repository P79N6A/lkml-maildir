Based upon the lspci output you posted earlier, aic7880 has a single
SCSI bus. So you must mean two internal connectors. Both of your devices
(HD and Tape) do show up on the same bus during scan. Since you have
connected devices to both connectors on the card, you must terminate
both devices. Sounds like you HD might be terminated. You need to
terminate tape drive as well. I do not have a C1536 handy, but if you
look at the back of the drive you should see 10 pins aligned
horizontally. They should all be labelled on the back panel and most
likely are (from left to right) - TP, 2, 1, 0, NC. TP is the pair of
Term Power Enable pins. Place a jumper over the leftmost two pins to
enable termination on the drive and try again.
