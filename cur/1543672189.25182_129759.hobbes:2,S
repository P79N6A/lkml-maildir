temper, temper
pls read my reply to alan carefully .
Doing  own malloc(), free(), m[un]map(), is a possibility we've
considered. Since we've got our own lib linked with the app, we probably
wouldn't even need LD_PRELOAD. our main issue is that not everything is
gcc/g77. 
Of all the approaches the syscall traps was the least intrusive and most
portable of all, belive it or not. 
BTW: this is all technical issues.
