Some APIC-related bugs in the kernel Bugzilla that have been reported or 
confirmed during the last 12 months (I only looked at "apic" in the 
subject, there might be more related bugs in the Bugzilla):
#5038 Fast running system clock with IO-APIC enabled
#5303 AMD64 Erratum: Should not enable C2 when using APIC
#5565 Guess of i386 APIC PTE area scribble
#6404 APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
#6748 Clock drifts by 30% for SMP kernel w/APIC
#6859 Linux kernel won't work without "nolapic" passed
#6890 Kernel boot freezes when APIC is enabled & SATA is used

On i386, it's a kernel configuration option.
On x86_64, the APIC is currently always enabled even when configuring a 
UP kernel.

What about non-ACPI SMP?
