I was going to say a while ago...
In PREEMPT=y the need_resched() is not needed at all. If you have 
preemption enabled, you will get preempted in that loop. No need for the 
need_resched() in the outer loop. Although I'm not sure how it would even 
hit the "need_resched". If it was set, then it is most likely going to be 
cleared when coming back from being preempted.

I was going to warn you about that ;-)
Without the check for !owner, you are almost guaranteed to go to sleep 
every time. Here's why:
You are spinning and thus have a hot cache on that CPU.
The owner goes to unlock but will be in a cold cache. It sets lock->owner 
to NULL, but is still in cold cache so it is a bit slower.
Once the spinner sees the NULL, it shoots out of the spin but sees the 
lock is still not available then goes to sleep. All before the owner could 
release it. This could probably happen at every contention. Thus, you lose 
the benefit of spinning. You probably make things worse because you add a 
spin before every sleep.
