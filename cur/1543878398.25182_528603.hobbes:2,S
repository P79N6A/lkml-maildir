Christer Weinigel: Until YOU, have actually used the REISER4 filesystem
yourself, I think YOU OWE IT to the people on the linux-kernel mailing
list, to, AS YOU SAY, shut the fuck up. 
Even reading up on the REISER4 filesystem would help. 
Applying a little intelligence would undoubtedly help too.

Oh, for fucks sake, would you, and your religious anti-REISER cohorts,
stop sounding like a broken record.

You, and your religious anti-REISER cohorts, have indeed repeated the
same broken arguments (if you can call them such) more times than I care
to count.
NO statistics, NO real facts, just selective MANIPULATION of facts.
> Please shut the fuck up.
Yes, why don't you politely, shut the fuck up.
Until YOU, have actually used the REISER4 filesystem yourself, I think
YOU OWE IT to the people on the linux-kernel mailing list, to shut the
fuck up, as YOU say.
I guess, the fact that you are a TOTAL HYPOCRITE, has completely escaped
you.
By the way: Did I thank you "delightful" people for the "pleasant"
welcome to the linux-kernel mailing list?

> So the two bonnie benchmarks with lzo and gzip are

YOU (yes, the one with no experience and next to NO knowledge on the
subject) claim that because bonnie++ writes files that are mostly zeros,
the results are meaningless. It should be mentioned that bonnie++ writes
files that are mostly zero for all the filesystems compared. So the
results are meaningful, contrary to would you claim.
And hopefully all will notice that you just ignore these tests:

where the files are definitely NOT mostly zeros. 
Your negligence has to be deliberate,... but why?
Are you manipulating the facts just to try and win an argument?
Most sane people will realize, that what you say is simply wrong.
ALSO YOU IGNORE examples offered by others, on lkml, which contradict
your assertion: FOR EXAMPLE:
> I see the same thing with my nightly scripts that do syslog analysis, last year 
> I trimmed 2 hours from the nightly run by processing compressed files instead of 
> uncompressed ones (after I did this I configured it to compress the files as

> the compression is < 30 min)
From David Lang 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/7/196
Willy Tarreau also mentions this situation in a couple of articles.
Let me spoon feed you:
David has said that compressing the logs takes
24 x 12 x 20 secs = 5,760 secs = 1.6 hours of CPU time (over the day)
but he saves 2 hours of CPU time on the daily syslog analysis.
For a total (minimum) saving of 24 minutes.
The actual saving is probably much greater. It depends on the CPU
utilization when not compressing, ie, whether you are using ide CPU
cycles or not. I guess it also depends on whether you can go home one
and a half hours earlier by using compression, or if your boss makes you
stick around anyway.
NOTE THAT THE FILES IN THIS EXAMPLE ARE ALSO NOT MAINLY ZEROS.
MAYBE you just lacked the knowledge to understand what David was saying,
or maybe your desire to denigrate REISER4 is so strong, that you simply
don't care what other people say about similar circumstances.
I am not sure why you have to be spoon feed on these matters, or why you
adamantly refuse to find the facts of the matter, for yourself.

You are a funny guy Jan.
Here you are, once again, cutting out my most useful information, ie,
the data I was discussing, while complaining that I cut out your most
useful information.

And this bit: 
Jan,... Here is another section, you conveniently cut out. Maybe you
should explain why you cut out this section? Was it embarrassing to you?
I mean, your statement is sort of correct,... but it shows a basic
misunderstanding of filesystems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
It is true that I considered your "most useful information," an
irrelevant section, which is why it was cut out (ignored).
I did not see my doing this, any worse than you doing it. I did not
realize that you were being so impolite.
As to your email being private, I had thought I had joined a mailing
list. I had no idea your email was meant to be private and just
considered it like all the others.
Now you mention it, I wondered why the email did not automatically list
the mailing lists, as recipients, and I had to add them. If I had
realized this I may have added the mailing lists as recipients, anyway.
It would be like me to do such. However, you should understand that I am
new to mailing lists.

So, likewise, I saw your comments (you know the ones you miss so much)
the first time around, and I ignored them, as I was not convinced of
their worth.
The benchmarks measure certain data. Its fine you do not read into them,
stuff that isn't there, like reliability, for example.

I never said I wanted discussion, you just said I did.
You just repeat, and repeat, and repeat.
In reality, I quite appreciate reasonable discussion. But, I doubt I
will get much from you.

Why do you think I hate reiserfs developers? That is an insane claim.
Why would I hate reiser3 developers?
Why would I hate reiser4 developers? 
Why would I even dislike them?
I think Hans Reiser is a genius. Is that what you mean by hate?
Answer this question. Why do YOU think I am antagonizing reiserfs
developers?
You must have a reason for stating what you have.

Why are you attacking me with sarcasm, when I have just stated a simple
fact?

I believe that compression in REISER4 is just a wrapper for gzip or lzo.
So each file is compressed and your "corruption propagation" is just in
your imagination.

You deliberately ignored the fact that bad blocks are NOT dealt with by
the filesystem,... but by the operating system. Like I said: If your
filesystem is writing to bad blocks, then throw away your operating
system.

Not necessarily, just look at the bonnie++ tests. The tests show that
using compression (with todays hardware) leads to read speeds that are
some FOUR times the physical disk read rate,... 
but you ignore this as you have some strange anti-REISER religion.
Think about it,... read speeds that are some FOUR times the physical
disk read rate,... impossible without the use of compression (or
something similar).

Wow, consider me STILL totally impressed by your AMAZING BIAS.
Would you like to tell me why you are SO BIASED against REISER4?
