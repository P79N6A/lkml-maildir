Yes, sorry that I was not explicit.

Oops, right, forget that.

...well, we rely on sysfs files to work... at least for
suspend-to-RAM, ok, no argument here. I doubt anyone really does mount
anything but sysfs on /sys...

Looks unneccessarily complex to me. We'd have to umount that tmpfs,
and playing with mounts inside system suspend seems wrong to me.
Perhaps we can chroot into /proc...  almost everyone has /proc
mounted, right? 
Is it possible to move console/vt open before freeze? That should be
enough.
