Yes - these are typical of the kernel text space reductions that
I am seeing as well.  Various little tweaks here and there, with
a careful eye to changes in the output of "nm -S".
The one exception being ia64, where I saved an additional
15000 or so kernel text bytes by uninlining find_next_bit().
Other arch's might want to try that same optimization.  I ran
out of gas, and lacked the resources, to persue that.
