generally things are posted to linux-arch for the arch maintainers to
review.  the person posting the changes does all the footwork to make
sure no one is left behind since they're the ones proposing the
change.  it isnt "hey, unless you do something, your arch is going to
be broken, sorry".

yes, the patch you posted for the remaining arches should fix the
arches left broken.
