Well, generally the linux architecture changes so fast that any such 
documents
become nearly immediately out of date and useless.  There is some 
really good
_current_ stuff in the Documentation directory of whatever kernel 
sources you've
got, if you want to take a look, but that's about it.  There are a 
number of sites that
document some of the simpler API's, but the complex stuff just changes 
too much
for that kind of thing to be useful.  Oh, and BTW, concerning a 
traceability matrix,
generally it doesn't really exist except for proprietary software.  
Linux design is
not "requirements-based" as commercial software is, it's 
"I-want-this-feature-bad-
-enough-to-code-it-and-get-it-included-based".  I suspect that 
companies like
IBM internally have requirements-based systems to organize their 
employees
into various tasks, but publicly there is no such system, aside from 
"It's broken
and I fixed it with this patch:".
