Precisely why I sent the post, to find out whether or not I need it,
or if there are any benefits (for me) to using it.  I don't, there
aren't, so I won't.  Pretty easy decision, actually. :-)
And just so there's no confusion,  I'm not against the concept of
udev, I think it is a _very_ good idea.  I just don't have a need for
it right now, that's all.
