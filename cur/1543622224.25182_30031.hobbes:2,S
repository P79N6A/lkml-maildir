Can they fall through multiple function calls? How do they jive with
preemtive scheduling? How much is the stack unwinding overhead?
Potentially this is very cool but I'm again appalled at the INSTANT
rejection seen here by kernel hackers, minor and major. Do NOT reject an
idea before you've thought it through. Do NOT reject an idea simply because
it is new.
Also, do not jump on the bandwagon BECAUSE it is new. But still - people
here should get a life if they get off on rejecting new stuff because it is
new.
