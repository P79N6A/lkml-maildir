I had this before, but i want the notification also for I2O devices, 
because the driver model won't call probe functions for devices, which 
are already occupied by a other driver. This is not the best solution, 
if you have more then one drivers which could handle a device. This is 
the case in e.g. i2o_proc, which only want to display information, and 
is not a "real driver". So finally there will be controller_add, 
controller_remove, device_add, device_remove... and i thought it would 
be more generic, and i also don't have to add a function each time a new 
notification is needed :-)
Also i tried to implement the notification like the one already in the 
kernel, so i could exchange my notification facility with the already 
existing one (include/linux/notifier.h)...
