Hello,
I would like to know why there are three types of processes organization
described in "kernel hackers guide" (vector, list and tree) when i see
that the only one really used in the kernel fonts are the "list" type (in
the scheduler). Anyone can help me? My graduation work is about
"schedulers" and i have to finish it ;-)
Thanks very much in advance.
