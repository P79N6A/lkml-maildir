Hi!
swsusp-v5 is out there.. Can be dowloaded at:
http://falcon.sch.bme.hu/~seasons/linux/swsusp.html
It is against kernel 2.2.1 and optionally there's a (new) patch for
sysvinit-2.76.
Ok, this is getting cooler and working smoother. Because of the 'almost'
ready support we don't get the proper screen back by resuming for the actual
console..not a big problem. Except for this I would say that it's getting
usable. It's against 2.2.1 but should apply to 2.2.2 with some offsets..
Debug messages are initally turned off. Many delays've been taken out, it
really works fast.
Highlights of this release:
pre1:
o       Support for suspend using shutdown (also patch for sysvinit)
        We no more depend on sysrq
o       Preliminary(?) support for SMP.. don't know if it works..
pre2:
o       tasks has TASK_STOPPED state got into "INTERESTING" macro
o       shrink_free_inodes() got deactivated.. ineffective and seems
        to have some incompatibilities with 2.2.1.. Will remove it..
o       For tasks to stop we wait 10 seconds (and starting to ignore
        UNINTERRUPTIBLE ones after 5 seconds). This time is more likely
        to be enough for tasks to stop but not 'forever' which could be
        unhealthy..
o       Documentation update
v5:
o       We track the allocated pagedir with a new bit in page's flags so
        we no more depend on actual memory management implementation.
o       Support hardware state restore (many event handlers yet to be written..)
        (Thanx to Steve Dodd)
o       We try to power down instead of rebooting.
o       sysvinit documentation update
o       time warping by resume is fixed ('stole' support from APM)
o       support for the possibility to resume hardware from userland
        (trough init) - see 'resume' action of sysvinit patch
o       Debug messages are optional so suspend/resume can be done silently
        without messing up the console..
o       Documentation update for sysvinit
o       Almost ready support for screen restoration
