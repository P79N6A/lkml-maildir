Looks to me like it's adding { and } on each side of the
"c->devices->prev=d;" statement... so changing from:
if (c->devices != NULL)
	c->devices->prev=d;
to 
if (c->devices != NULL){
	c->devices->prev=d;
}
I assume the new compiler likes the if to have explicit brackets instead of
using the next statement...
