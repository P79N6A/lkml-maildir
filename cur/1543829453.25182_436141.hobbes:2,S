yep - the default got removed.

i have solved this problem in current -mm by making more advanced 
versions of lock debugging (allocation/exit checks, validator) depend on 
more basic lock debugging options. All the basic lock debugging options 
have a DEBUG_KERNEL dependency, which thus gets inherited by the other 
options as well.

ok, done. (Btw., there's tons of other Kconfig code though that uses the 
bool + depends syntax though, and def_bool usage is quite rare.)
