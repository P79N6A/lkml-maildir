I don't think that switch to GPLv3 can be described as upgrade.  I certainly
have no intention to do that to my code; some of it I might release under BSD
license, and that can be used in any project.  The rest of the kernel stuff
I've done (and that's the majority of my contributions) is under GPLv2 *only*.
