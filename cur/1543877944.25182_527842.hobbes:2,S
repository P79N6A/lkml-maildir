Hello,
Carl Love and I have been working on getting the latest perfmon2 patches 
(
http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/
) working on Cell, and on powerpc in 
general. We've come up with some powerpc-specific questions and we're hoping 
to get some opinions from the powerpc kernel developers.
First, the stock 2.6.20 kernel has a prototype in include/linux/smp.h for a 
function called smp_call_function_single(). However, this routine is only 
implemented on i386, x86_64, ia64, and mips. Perfmon2 apparently needs to 
call this to run a function on a specific CPU. Powerpc provides an 
smp_call_function() routine to run a function on all active CPUs, so I used 
that as a basis to add an smp_call_function_single() routine. I've included 
the patch below and was wondering if it looked like a sane approach.
Next, we ran into a problem related to Perfmon2 initialization and sysfs. The 
problem turned out to be that the powerpc version of topology_init() is 
defined as an __initcall() routine, but Perfmon2's initialization is done as 
a subsys_initcall() routine. Thus, Perfmon2 tries to initialize its sysfs 
information before some of the powerpc cpu information has been initialized. 
However, on all other architectures, topology_init() is defined as a 
subsys_initcall() routine, so this problem was not seen on any other 
platforms. Changing the powerpc version of topology_init() to a 
subsys_initcall() seems to have fixed the bug. However, I'm not sure if that 
is going to cause problems elsewhere in the powerpc code. I've included the 
patch below (after the smp-call-function-single patch). Does anyone know if 
this change is safe, or if there was a specific reason that topology_init() 
was left as an __initcall() on powerpc?
Thanks for your help!

Add an smp_call_function_single() to the powerpc architecture. This is mostly
a copy of smp_call_function(), but with minor modifications to call only the
specified CPU.
