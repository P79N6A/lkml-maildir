Well, the original idea for having all that compatibility cruft in
coda.h was that the identical header could be used both by userspace,
and as part of the kernel code of all Coda ports.
But with problems like these popping up and the silly thing is just
turning into an unmaintainable mess of #ifdef bloat.
#include <linux/coda.h> can be taken out of linux/fs.h when I change a
few lines of code. In fact with those changes all Coda related headers
can be moved from include/linux/ to fs/coda/, although coda.h contains
the 'exported interface' and should probably remain in include/linux.
At least this will solve your problem as long as Coda isn't compiled
into the kernel, but not the reported problem of compiling a Linux
kernel on a different (Coda supported) OS without using a properly
configured cross-compiler.
I will try cleaning things up by having a common 'coda.h' for all
platforms (and userspace) and platform specific 'coda_types.h' files
which define missing types and such. It would definitely get rid of a
lot of the bloat, and probably make things somewhat easier to maintain.

btw. Coda is not an acronym, no need to capitalize it.
