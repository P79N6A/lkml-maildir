To my knowledge, not every machine has the HPET live on a BAR in PCI space. It
is cosmetic, but it shows what devices are using what memory address space in
/proc/iomem so one doesn't need to dig through dmesg to piece things together.
I am going to work w/ Matthias to see if we can get a patch working with his
system. I think that it is beneficial to easily view where resources are being
used, but I do understand the prudence.
