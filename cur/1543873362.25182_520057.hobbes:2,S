In my experience, the current situation is a pain in the ass.
There are at least 3 different ways how arch/x86_64/ uses arch/i386/ 
code [1], and at least 2 different ways how arch/i386/ uses arch/x86_64/
So whenever you touch one file in arch/i386/ or arch/x86_64/, there are 
5 different ways how this code could be used from the other architecture.
I'd even suggest the following:
- move all files under arch/x86_64/ that are also used under arch/i386/
  to arch/i386/ and then
- mv arch/x86_64 arch/i386/mach-x86_64
The associated Makefile and Kconfig changes shouldn't be a problem, and 
after this it will become much easier to see where code gets used.

[1] Steven forgot in his list the fifth one:
      obj-$(CONFIG_MTRR)              += ../../i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/
    The problem with this variant is that different from the
    other 4 ways, grep'ing for a filename doesn't find it...
