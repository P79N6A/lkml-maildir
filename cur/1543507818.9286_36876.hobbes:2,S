I noticed this a few months ago, and after consulting this list was told
that it was an artifact of the CPU utilization monitoring process. (I
was using xosview).  I wasn't sure that I bought it though, so I set up
some cpu-bound test programs that monitored their scheduling via the
proc filesystem and sure enough, they were *not* really bouncing back
and forth from CPU to CPU.  In about 50 test runs it only realy bounced
around on one of them, and I assume that some other process was doing
wierd things during that run, rather than it being a scheduling problem.
