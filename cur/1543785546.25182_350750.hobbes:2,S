Sorry, I thought it was more obvious... :)

In the basic model you need two locks. 1) the current semaphore for 
general cpusem management 2) a second lock to synchronize with kernel 
callbacks, the type of this lock depends on the callback requirements, 
but for simplicity let's assume a spinlock. It's possible to split it 
further into per-cpuset spinlocks, but let's get the basic scheme 
working, more fine grained locking can be built on top of this.

Active meant here that it's attached to a task. Any access to 
"tsk->cpuset" has to be protected by the spinlock (in the general case, 
e.g. for cpuset_exit() it's avoidable).

Yes, see aove.

Yes.

All kernel callbacks are done using the spinlock, as soon as you hold this 
spinlock it's safe to dereference tsk->cpuset, as attach_task() can't 
change this field. Also attach_task() makes sure that the count of an 
attached cpuset is always different from zero, so cpuset_rmdir() cannot 
remove it. attach_task() and cpuset_rmdir() are synchronized using the 
semaphore.
You have to concentrate on the state of a cpuset, it can be either active 
or inactive. Certain operations (e.g. removal) are only possible if it's 
inactive and these are protected by the semaphore. Other operations are 
only possible when the cpuset is active and you need the spinlock for 
them, as long as the cpuset is active and you only hold the semaphore 
some operations are not possible (e.g. changing the parent).
attach_task() switches between these two states and so has to shortly 
take both locks.

Yes, but that's a separate step.

If you want to do it like this, just add an else before the last 
atomic_dec().
The main point I was trying to make is that clearing tsk->cpuset doesn't 
require the spinlock, as long as you check for dead tasks in 
attach_task(). Ignore the rest if it's too confusing.
