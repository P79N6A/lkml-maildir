That works well with ext* filesystems as one can set it anytime with 
e2label if I recall; however, how can one do this with XFS, is it 
possible without booting off a boot-cd etc?
Here is the filesystem information:
p254:~# xfs_info /dev/sdd2
meta-data=/dev/root              isize=256    agcount=16, agsize=1186676 blks
          =                       sectsz=512   attr=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=18986816, imaxpct=25
          =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096 
log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=9270, version=1
          =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=0
realtime =none                   extsz=65536  blocks=0, rtextents=0
When I try to label it:
p254:~# xfs_admin -L "root" /dev/sdd2
xfs_admin: /dev/sdd2 contains a mounted filesystem
fatal error -- couldn't initialize XFS library
The label is currently not set:
p254:~# xfs_admin -l  /dev/sdd2
label = ""
p254:~#
I guess my next step is to try UUID?
        Instead of giving the device explicitly, one may indicate the (ext2  or
        xfs)  filesystem that is to be mounted by its UUID or volume label (cf.
        e2label(8) or  xfs_admin(8)),  writing  LABEL=<label>  or  UUID=<uuid>,
        e.g.,   `LABEL=Boot'   or  `UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6'.
        This will make the system more robust: adding or removing a  SCSI  disk
        changes the disk device name but not the filesystem volume label.
p254:~# xfs_admin -U generate /dev/sdd2
xfs_admin: /dev/sdd2 contains a mounted filesystem
fatal error -- couldn't initialize XFS library
p254:~#
Hmm, am I out of luck?
