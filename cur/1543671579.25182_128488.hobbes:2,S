Andries,
I applied your patch to my version which is found at:
http://www.torque.net/scsi/scsi_mid_low_api.txt.gz
It describes some changes from Mike Anderson
and others that are not yet in the kernel (e.g. a full
implementation of scsi_set_device_offline() ). That is
why it hasn't been presented as a patch yet.
Thanks for the feedback.
Doug Gilbert
