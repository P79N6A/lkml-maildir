init_registers() reinitialized the rx and tx ring pointers as seen by
the nic. You called it without init_ring(), i.e. the ring pointers as
seen by the driver didn't match the values used by the nic. It probably
only worked by chance. And changing the ring pointers while the nic is
in the middle of a data transfers just asks for trouble.
I agree that natsemi_stop_rxtx() instead of reset would be enough.

Yes, they are always 0. Actually the code is (and was) never executed.
Everyone calls enable_wol_mode(,0).
