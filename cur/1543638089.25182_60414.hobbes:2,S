Part of the answer is to use mdadm
   
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
mdadm --assemble --force ....
will do a lot of that for you.
Another part of the answer is that raid5 should never mark two drives
as failed.  There really isn't any point.
If they are both really failed, you've lost your data anyway.
If it is really a cable failure, then it should be easier to get back
to where you started from.
I hope to have raid5 working better in this respect in 2.6.
A finally part of the answer is that even perfect raid software cannot
make up for buggy drivers, shoddy hard drives, or flacky cabling.
