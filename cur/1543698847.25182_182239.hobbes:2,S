The nices thing is that the evolution from 2.6.0 to 2.6.8 will be very
fast :-), what are the predictions? mine is less than 6 months, we begin
with a nice kernel, not the best, but will finish those 6 months with a
great kernel, really stable, the the release pace will be slower, and we
can start to think on the new shiny unstable 2.7.x kernel :-)
