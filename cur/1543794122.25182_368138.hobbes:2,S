The flags buffer is used to hold the state of each character. Its
usually TTY_NORMAL and is set to TTY_NORMAL by the functions not taking
a flag value. It serves the same task as the flag buffer in the old

Private to the tty layer pointer to allow small buffers as used with
byte at a time uarts to be recycled not freed/allocated
