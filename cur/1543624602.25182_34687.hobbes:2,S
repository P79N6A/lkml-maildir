Subject: Problems using new Linux-2.4 bitkeeper repository.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

How do those of us who've been using the
http://gkernel.bitkeeper.net/marcelo-2.4
for development resync against the kernel24.bkbits.net tree?  It looks like 
the changes from 2.4.18-pre8 onwards all have different patch IDs in the new 
tree; so when I try to do a pull from my current repository I get tons of 
conflicts, if I try to do a receive of just the patch set I get a resync error:
takepatch: can't find parent ID
        jgarzik@mandrakesoft.com|ChangeSet|20020225230300|18879
        in RESYNC/SCCS/s.ChangeSet
The thought of taking everything back to the common ancestor and then trying 
to apply the changes one at a time and adding the change logs by hand isn't 
that appealing (I have 3 2.4 repositories, some with upwards of 10 additional 
change sets in them).
