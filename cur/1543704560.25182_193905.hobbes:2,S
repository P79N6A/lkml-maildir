The code doesn't assume two OS's. It only assumes that the VM monitor 
switches between the host OS and the guest OS alone, but that doesn't 
prevent you from running two or more monitors, which would be scheduled 
by the host OS scheduler.

That's interesting, but allowing Cooperative Linux to directly access 
the hardware is problematic on systems like Windows. coLinux's goal is 
more focused on bringing Linux to other operating systems than resources 
sharing among several operating systems.
However, I have no doubt it can be used to run several virtual Linux's 
on a single SMP Linux machine, with emphasis on the 'virtual'.
