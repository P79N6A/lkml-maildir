Yeah, don't trash your backups.
If/when you try something again, how about these two trivial one-liners?
I'm not 100% sure the mapcount sanity check is strictly speaking right (no 
locking between mapcount/pagecount comparison), but the page count really 
should never fall below the mapcount, so aside from races that I don't 
think can be triggered in practice, this might be very useful to find 
where those pesky page counts suddenly disappear..
Right now we get the oops "too late" - something has decremented the page
count way too far, but we don't know what it was, and the actual function 
that triggers it _seems_ to be harmless.
The other part of the patch is to clear "page" when it's being free'd, in 
case somebody tries to free the same thing twice. I don't see how that 
could happen either, but...
The patch is untested in every way. No guarantees.
