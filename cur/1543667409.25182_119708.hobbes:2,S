Sorry, but you seem to forget that a significant amount of people use
kernel.org kernels, but don't monitor LKML nor are able to choose from
the various patches floating there the most appropriate fix.
If 2.4.21 were expected in a few days, it would make sense to delay the
fix, but this doesn't seem to be the case, so I think that a hot-fix
really should be released quickly (either as 2.4.20.1 or 2.4.21)

And why couldn't it be the same for 2.4.21?
				Have a nice fortnight
