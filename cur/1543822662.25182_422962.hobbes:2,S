If the motivation for these patches is to minimize disruption of the
workload when offlining a group of cpus, then I think the reasonable
alternative is for the admin (or a script) to migrate sensitive
tasks and interrupts to cpus that are not going to be offlined --
before offlining any cpus.
On the other hand, I'm getting the feeling that the problem you're
really trying to address is that offlining lots of cpus takes a long
time (on the order of a couple seconds per cpu) on your architectures.
So is it one of these two things, or a combination of both, or what?

I guess I don't understand what you're getting at here.  Are you
agreeing with me?  Or are you saying that doing this is a problem?

That's an architecture-specific behavior.  On powerpc, interrupts
bound to a dying cpu have their affinity reset to the default (all cpus).

Yes, and the kernel really shouldn't have to be smart about this.
This is a matter of policy.  The admin knows which cpus are going to
be online.  The admin is free to reassign the irqs before offlining
cpus for optimal behavior.  (Of course, the kernel should still have a
sane fallback behavior, and it does.)
So, I still don't see the benefit of adding this change which works
around the kernel's scheduling behavior etc. when the admin easily has
the ability to mitigate the disruption by taking some preliminary
measures.
