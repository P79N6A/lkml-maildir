Hi!
In certain configurations (small or minimal), with "make menuconfig",
it is not possible to enter the submenus for
 Fusion MPT device support
 ISDN support
 I2O device support
I don't know on which configuration these depend, but it would be nice if
they told the user the reason rather than doing nothing.
Regards,
hjb
