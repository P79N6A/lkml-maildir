On a different system, I found a more interesting issue.
Specifically, pnp0/00:01 and pnp0:00/03 both have ids ... the appended
patch goes on top of the previous pnpacpi patch, and should (nyet tested!)
fix another place I saw that warning.

=========	CUT HERE
Handle PNP devices that have the same IDs a bit more sanely ... I suspect
that pnp_dev.number should be compared with some acpi_device field to make
it hook up to a particular ACPI device, but I'll leave that to someone who
knows how that's supposed to work.  At least this will connect e.g. multiple
PNP nodes to ACPI nodes sharing the same PNP0c02 id.
