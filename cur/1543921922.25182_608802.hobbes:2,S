Thanks for trying to get this merged, we've had a few users asking
us to support this in the Fedora kernel.
From a quick look through, it doesn't look too bad.
A couple of obvious things that jumped out..
* The example program in the Documentation dir.
  There was some discussion recently about moving away 
  from doing this, and instead moving code to the samples/ dir
  (or including it in util-linux instead if applicable).

  should be
    .name = "ktimer"
  etc..

This should be getting included automatically for you.
On the whole, asides from these (very) minor nits, quite a clean
submission compared to a lot of new driver submissions to lkml.
Might want to run it through scripts/checkpatch.pl too to see
if that picks up any more minor fluff.
