Ah.  I should have guessed :)  I've seen a few similar ones on PPC.
I'll update the patch.

Yes, this is an annoyance.  I'm trying to figure out how to adapt
split-include to work with the tweak headers, and I don't think it will
be too painful.  It'll just require something in the middle to take
<asm/tweaks.h> and spit out something akin to <linux/autoconf.h>.
So aside from that, any other comments about the idea or implementation?
