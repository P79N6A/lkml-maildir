I wanted to avoid changing the non-arch specific code, but I beleive this
is the best way to do. We could define a generic GPF_UNCACHED flag too,
so this would make it useable with kmalloc too. This will be useful for
other non-coherent archs (like PowerMac Nubus).

I don't think neither.

Ok. So I'll implement GPF_UNCACHED, and vmalloc_unached will simply pass
this instead of GPF_KERNEL. This way, we can have both vmalloc_uncached
and kmalloc(xxx, GPF_UNCACHED).
I'll also add a #define for the cache line size in asm/io.h and a function:
pci_device_is_cache_coherent(struct pcidev *dev)
which will hard-return true on coherent archs.
Linus, are you ok with that ?
