That works, but please don't do it without also adding something like:
#warning This driver should be updated to the new ECC API.
Or you could just leave the warning we already have :)
It works at the moment because the only thing that _uses_ the driver in
question is something which also doesn't use the new argument. We're
working on a new driver and at that point we'll also update the code
which uses it.
