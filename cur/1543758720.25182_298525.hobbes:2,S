->memory_backed is already overloaded in various awkward ways.  It would be
good to fix that up first, then add enhancements in a later patch.
Furthermore I'd suggest that we remove ->memory_backed and simply add a
bunch of new booleans to backing_dev_info rather than futzing with
bitflags.  Those booleans could be bitfields, of course.
And those fields should refer to device capabilities and not to device
characteristics: "what it can do" rather than "what it is".  So
"contributes to dirty memory" and "needs writeback" are good and "is a ram
disk thingy" is bad.
So in 2.6.11 as-is, we have:
bdi->dirty_memory_acct		Contributes to dirty memory accounting
bdi->needs_writeback		Needs writeback

Not sure what this means.

Invert the sense of this, use ->needs_writeback

Lose this.

A separate field in backing_dev_info?
That `membacked' stuff in the !NOMMU implementation of do_mmap_pgoff()
looks like it could benefit from some rework as a result of the above as
well.  It all looks rather inferential.
