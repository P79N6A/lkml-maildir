I quite agree. I didn't choose my words very well.

Well, yes and no. If your machine performs general server activities you are
correct. If it exists to perform number crunching jobs it will never be big
enough. It will always be compute bound. The thing is, you should never allow
it to run more than one compute bound job per processor at any time. If you
do, the cache sloshing just makes it much slower.
I intended my previous message to talk about this, and how attacking the cache
sloshing would pay far greater dividends than any tweaking of the scheduler. I
ended up thinking out loud, and hit send before adequately reviewing the
pertinence of what I wrote. My C is OK until 4AM, but my English falls apart
by midnight!
