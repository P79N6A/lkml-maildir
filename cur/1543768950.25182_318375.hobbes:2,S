What we really need, is a less thorough version of O_SYNC.
O_SYNC currently guarantees that when syscall returns, data
is on media (or at least in disk drive's internal cache :).
This is exactly what really paranoid people want.
Journalling labels, all that good stuff.
But there are many cases where people just want to say
'write out dirty data asap for this device', so that
I can copy files to floppy, wait till it stops making
noise, and eject a disk. Samr for flash if it has write
indicator (mine has a diode).
The difference from O_SYNC is that in this O_LAZY_SYNC mode
writes return early, just filling pagecache, but writeout
is started immediately and continues until there is no dirty
O_LAZY_SYNC data.
This mode won't eat flash as fast as O_SYNC does.
