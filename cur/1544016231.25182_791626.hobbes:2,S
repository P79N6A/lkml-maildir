I have a driver which uses sysfs_create_dir() to create a set of
directories under the device sysfs directory to bundle up attributes
that are added common for each sub-part of the device.
Firstly, is this considered a problem
Secondly, sysfs_create_dir() is not exported so the driver cannot
currently be built as a module. Would a patch to export sysfs_create_dir
be acceptable?
