I think changing all of this mess to:
[root@localhost root]# tune2fs -O extents /dev/whatever
WARNING: Enabling extents on /dev/whatever will make this filesystem
unreadable in Linux kernels versions before 2.6.19!
Are you sure you want to do this? <y/n>
[root@localhost root]# tune2fs -O ^extents /dev/whatever
WARNING: Disabling extents on /dev/whatever requires you to run e2fsck
on this filesystem before it can be used again!
Are you sure you want to do this? <y/n>
might assuage many of the fears presented in this thread.
