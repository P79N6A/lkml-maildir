Does anyone know how much of a difference there is between the working
and nonworking code?  Theoretically it should be possible to back it
out, especially if we have a point at which we know it stopped
working.  Right?
Unfortunately I am no kernel hacker.  My knowledge up till now extends 
to fixing misspellings that haven't been patched yet.  =)
Additionally, I know nothing about USB.  However, I'm willing to poke
around a little bit, especially if anyone wants to help.  I know I can 
at least test other peoples' code...  =)
