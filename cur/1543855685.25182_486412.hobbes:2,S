Hi,
A little belated (sorry), but the only comment I have right now on the
patchset is that the get_ipc() seems like it shouldn't take the write
arg.  Perhaps if consistency is the concern, get_uts() should simply
be called get_uts_locked(table, need_write) ?  This also avoids the
mysterious '1' argument in the next patch at get_ipc(table, 1);
Oh, I lied, one more comment.  It seems worth a comment at the top of
get_uts() and get_ipc() explaining that table->data points to
init_uts->data and that's why the 'which = which - init_uts + uts'
works.
thanks,
