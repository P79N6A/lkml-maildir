ltt isn't *mine* anymore, somebody else is maintaining it at this point,
and it remains to be seen whether any of my input in this thread is:
a) appreciated by them, b) agreed by them.
With regards to the tone of the thread, then please at least read other
people's approach to me, including yourself. I think the casual observer
will see that there was a great deal of animosity aimed at me personally.
I'll admit to being sarcastic and biting back. But that's hardly alien
to lkml.

Hmm... and then compare that to the negative impact of kprobes at runtime.
Of course if we could override the syscall table your point disappears.
That's not how ltt does it now, but it could easily be done otherwise.
All implementations I've looked at so far of syscall in Linux involve
a table. If the base of this table was a dynamically modifiable entry,
then the problem is solved. Wouldn't it?

I've explained earlier the difference in between these things.

It is for some. And please stop repeating the syscall path stuff. It can
be solved elegantly. The fact that it hasn't up to this point is only an
excuse to keep working harder on it. There is, in fact, no reason that
the solution may not just be a combination of static markup and dynamic
modification.

How many embedded Linux projects did you personally work on?
