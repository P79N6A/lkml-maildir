Right, we want to avoid that heavy contention.

It looks like the 512p we have here is pretty heavily reserved this week, so 
I'm not sure if I'll be able to test this (someone else might, John?).  I 
think the balance we're looking for is between simplicity and non-brokenness.  
Builtin profiling is *supposed* to be simple and dumb, and were it not for 
the readprofile times, I'd say per-cpu would be the way to go just because it 
retains the simplicity of the current approach while allowing it to work on 
large machines (as well as limiting the performance impact of builtin 
profiling in general).  wli's approach seems like a reasonable tradeoff 
though, assuming what you suggest doesn't work.
Thanks,
Jesse
