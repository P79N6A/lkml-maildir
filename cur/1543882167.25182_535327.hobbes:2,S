You just described non-contiguous compount pages.
Not much different, but how do you link all the pages together while
still having a private pointer for the filesystem without growing
the struct page?  Remember, you have to be able to get from any page
to the head node, and you have to be able to get from the head node
to the individual pages when you have to free the compound page.
You'll need something like a linked list between the pages in
addition to the head pointer.
And then there's the allocation code - you need to alloc 1 page
N times rather than N pages once. And then we can still only
get 128 pages into a bio so all we've done churned some in memory
structures and not gained anything where it counts (i.e. on the
storage).
IMO, non-contiguous compound pages are more difficult to manage,
will burn lots more cpu, consume more memory and be able to drive
I/O no faster than the current code. three strikes and you're
out; fouri strikes....
OTOH, contiguous compound pages burn little extra CPU,  will consume
less memory due to smaller radix trees and less bufferhead usage and
can improve the I/O efficiency of the machine.....

More, actually, and with a bigger impact on memory usage because of
the struct page size changes needed.

scsi.h:
/*
 *      The maximum sg list length SCSI can cope with
 *      (currently must be a power of 2 between 32 and 256)
 */
#define SCSI_MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS  MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS
And from blkdev.h:
#define MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS 128
#define MAX_HW_SEGMENTS 128
So currentlt on SCSI we are limited to 128 s/g entries, and the
maximum is 256.  So I'd say we've got good grounds for needing
contiguous pages to go beyond 1MB I/O size on x86_64.

And it's a block layer construct it's rather heavyweight compared
to a compound page and a bufferhead for the disk mapping....

You missed a layer - the filesystem is usually the transalation
layer between the page cache and the BIO.  Buffer heads are used to
carry extra filesystem state that can't fit on the page. Like the
block number the page is mapped to (i.e. the translation key for
page cache to bio mapping), the per block state (dirty,
unwritten, new, etc), and so on.
From this information we can construct bios when they are
appropriate, but to use bios where we currently use buffer heads
is extremely wasteful of memory (we often have millions of bufferheads
in memory at once).
FWIW, block size larger than page size also reduces bufferhead usage
so XFS will reduce it's memory footprint when doing buffered writes.

Many filesystems use a block device address space to address all
their metadata. e.g ext2/3 can't put metadata and therefore track
usage above 16TB. Therefore, filesytem gets no larger.

That's rather wasteful, though. Better to only use the large pages
when the filesystem needs them rather than penalise all filesystems.

Right, exactly. So apart from the contiguous allocation issue, you think
we are doing the right thing?
