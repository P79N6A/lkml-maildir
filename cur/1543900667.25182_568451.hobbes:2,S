I don't have a problem with the sysadmin *telling* the system "the other end of
that fiber cable has characteristics X, Y and Z".  What worried me was that it
looked like conflating "device reported writeback cache" with "device actually
has enough battery/hamster/whatever backup to flush everything on a power loss".
(My back-of-envelope calculation shows for a worst-case of needing a 1ms seek
for each 4K block, a 1G cache can take up to 4 1/2 minutes to sync.  That's
a lot of battery..)
