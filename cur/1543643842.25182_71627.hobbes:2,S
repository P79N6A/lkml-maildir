get_pid() is simple, I don't see why it's taking you so long to add those
features.  I'll sketch out a plan for an improvement in getpid_MARK02(c)
numbers once you have the prototype done.

Given my misspelling of Turing, I think it's clear that get_pid() needs a
spellchecker.  This would be an opportunity to begin work on get_pid .NET.
} the first small mystery to solve are certain perturbations in Alan
} Turing's name. But, yes, it's definitely a goal of the PID allocator to be
} an answer to all, but also for it to avoid infinite loops for every
} possible input value, while yielding slightly more subtle output than the
} numeric value of 42. Patch in a few minutes.
Please be sure to implement a BK replacement, open-source it, switch the
kernel over to it and supply the patch in that format.  It would be
appreciated.
