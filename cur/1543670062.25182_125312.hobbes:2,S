           Summary: rtc won't compile because expect return from void
                    function
    Kernel Version: 2.5.67
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: jstrand1@rochester.rr.com
Distribution:  Debian
Hardware Environment:  P4
Software Environment:  gcc 2.95.3
Problem Description:  
rtc fails to compile because of this line in drivers/char/genrtc.c (in
gen_rtc_proc_output, ca line 453):
flags = get_rtc_time(&tm);
get_rtc_time is a void function.  Also, though it will compile, just setting
flags to '0' would result in proc output not being accurate, since flags is
ANDed to various items.
