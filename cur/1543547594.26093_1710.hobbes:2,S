Not necessarily. Promise uses kernel headers in their beta binary only
driver for their stupid raid card's raid support. This makes them a direct
violator of the GPL. They also require a glue patch to go into the kernel
to make their loadable module work and ship a .o to be linked in as well,
so not only is Promise violating the GPL but anyone who ships their driver
is too as well.
The situation with M-systems might be similar.
It all would be *SO* much easier if Linus has not made the
'clairification' that binary modules are permitted.

Now, come on.. Thats silly. They are telling people to violate the GPL,
and not even mentioning this 'little' detail. Thats not right. In the US,
contributory copyright infringement is illegal too.. (not that I think
much about IP laws...)
You can't claim that M-systems shouldn't be accountable. They have been
told multiple times about the error of their actions.
