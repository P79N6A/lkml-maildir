There's a patch for these in current -mm.
For now, you can read kernel/panic.c comments:
 *  'P' - Proprietary module has been loaded.
 *  'F' - Module has been forcibly loaded.
 *  'S' - SMP with CPUs not designed for SMP.
 *  'R' - User forced a module unload.
 *  'M' - Machine had a machine check experience.
 *  'B' - System has hit bad_page.
