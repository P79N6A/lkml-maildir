OK, fuse is special.  So is the userspace driver framework (UIO)
proposed by Greg KH and co.  Now what can be done about these?
 - making them not-special is not an option due to the established
   interfaces, which don't allow restartability.
 - fixing the freezer is pretty much impossible because the
   dependencies between the tasks cannot be known.
 - removing the freezer and fixing the drivers seems workable, we
   already have a prototype in the form of the powermac architecture.
It seems pretty clear cut.  Whining about how much problems this will
cause won't get us nearer to a solution.
