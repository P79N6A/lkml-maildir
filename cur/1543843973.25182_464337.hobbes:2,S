Yes, it's mainly there for CPU's that don't have a math co-processor,
but it's also there for the cases where the math co-processor is
broken or where for some other reason you may not want to use it - so
it really should work...  Sure, it may be slow as hell compared to
hardware, but if it's there and I can select it then it should at
least be functional.
