Thanks - the above guidance has much more detail than you offered before
and is much more useful.
Too bad that schedule_timeout() was the only option at the time. :^(
And I apologize I don't recall what the issues were with schedule_timeout().
I suspect they will rear their ugly head with the workqueue
implementation as well. But if they don't, that will be great.

Well, then it's a great opportunity for someone interested in hacking
NIC drivers to cut their teeth on. :^)
After three years of using/maintaining the (trivial) tulip patch
in parisc-linux tree (and shipped with RH/SuSe ia64 releases),
I don't recall anyone complaining that udelays in tulip phy reset
caused them problems. Sorry, I'm unmotivated to revisit this.
Convince someone else to make tulip to use workqueues and I'll
resubmit a clean patch on top of that for the phy init sequences.
thanks,
grant
