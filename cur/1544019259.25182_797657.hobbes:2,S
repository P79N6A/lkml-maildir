It's really simple. A kernel upgrade in a -stable series point release
broke a rational user-space setup. If you don't want to adjust the
defaults, then the sane thing to do is to revert the commit that
caused the grief. Postfix is everywhere. Apache is everywhere.
Userspace is not broken here, and the whole idea of a -stable series
is that administrators can upgrade to them without having to worry
about things getting broken or making specific configuration changes
by point release.
