Sure. Automatic re-mailing can be part of the maintainership, if the
testing of the validity of the patch is also automated (ie add a automated
note that says that it has been verified).
It's just that I actually _have_ had people who just put "mail torvalds <
crap" in their cron routines. It quickly caused them to become part of my
spam-filter, and thus _nothing_ ever showed up from them, whether
automated or not..
