by that argument we could never include _anything_ in -mm because ... 
only some bigger release would excercise error paths?
Your argument makes no objective sense to me - my patch is a 
non-intrusive debugging facility that people clearly find useful and 
that would increase the quality of kernel bugreporting.
If, contrary to expectation, it decreases kernel bugreporting quality 
then we'll disable it quickly - just like we did it with other debugging 
facilities that were causing more trouble than good. (suck as the stack 
unwinder code)
In fact it can already by disabled easily, from user-space, without any 
kernel change, by doing:
   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs
and there you go, no warnings at all. Or you can add this to 
/etc/sysctl.conf to disable it permanently:
   kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs = 0
or you can disable it in the .config. So i dont see your problem. It's 
just like most other debug facilities. (in fact it's more flexible than 
most other debug facilities)
