Hello folks,
   I have a question involving process migration implementations on the
Linux kernel level. I am trying to write some kernel code support and also
some papers on this topic so now I am searching for various existing
implementations (or implementation attempts).
   Please, if you know about any such an implementation, let me know. It
can be any project trying to implement migration or some other related
things (such as checkpointing, cluster management etc.) under Linux. I
prefer kernel-level support but it may even be some user-level library.
Please, reply directly to me rather than to this list. Thank you.
   The projects I already know about include: MOSIX, epckpt, GNU Queue,
Berkeley NOW, Beowulf, Condor and other...
   Thanks for your help. I hope there will be some useful results for
everyone... ;-)
   Martin Kacer.
