if i don't enable the radeon backlight support the backlight works and
i can turn it on and off using radeontool. if i enable the radeon
backlight support the screen stays dark (although i can log on my
laptop remotely). if i try to use radeontool to turn the backlight on
nothing happens. so, at least on the thinkpad, the radeon backlight
support disables some other kind of backlight support that works
otherwise.
