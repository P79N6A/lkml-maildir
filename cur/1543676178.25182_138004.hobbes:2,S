The log message is useful.
I think the resync code is a bit like the OOM killer.
We need it, but something is wrong if it ever gets used.
It also doesn't quite work the way it should.
Anyway...
I only get the problem with NFS traffic. It may be
that NFS traffic is the only way I've yet found to
generate extreme network usage though.
The system with problems is an NFSv3 client that
gets abused by an in-house version control system
based on SCCS. I suppose this is like running
"tar xf foo.tar" or "tar xf foo.tar foo" over NFS.
The hardware is:
