Hi Chris,
I applied the patch and reran the test on a RH 9.0 system.  LTP is
continuing past where it failed before, and processes are not getting
killed, so I assume the OOM killer is no longer getting activated.
There is a new behavior, though.  Now the test is hanging indefinitely
on the nptl01 test.  I am assuming that since it passed the spot that it
had failed before, that this is an unrelated issue.
