Fortunately, the ip_masq_ftp.o module is (supposed to be) a little
smarter.  It will bind the data channel to the control channel.  When
something comes in on the data channel, the control channel's timeout it
reset.
The bad news is that I believe that the PASV detection in the module is
broken (and thus the binding doesn't take place).  Active ftp gets
detected properly.
Here's a patch (hand pulled out of a larger patch of mine) which should
fix things.

It may not be perfect, but I've been using it for a couple of months
without problem.

P.S. The larger patch dynamically creates forwarding rules for ftp.  With
the patch in place, you only have to masquerade outgoing port 21 instead
of having to create an outgoing port 20 (for active) and outgoing
1024-4999 (for passive).  See 
http://pebbles.net/~kfrench/linux/
 for the
whole thing.  I can feel the kernel gods cringing right now, heh.
