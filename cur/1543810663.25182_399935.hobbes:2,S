Go for it, something like that is long overdue -- since you cannot be
bothered to fork experimental kernels as playgrounds which only merge
when the dust has settled.
Still, /sys has apparently changed in an incompatible way, too, Douglas
Gilbert was forced to update his userspace stuff because sysfs cahnged
layout. This madness of constantly breaking user space applications
needs to stop.
