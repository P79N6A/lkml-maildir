I happen to have this one stored in my desktop.
 From AMD-8132TM HyperTransportTM

79 AMD-8132TM Tunnel Lacks Extended Configuration
         Space Memory-Mapped I/O Base Address Register
Description
Current AMD processors do not natively support PCI-defined extended configuration space. A memory
mapped I/O base address register (MMIO BAR) is required in chipset devices to support extended
configuration space. The AMD-8132 does not have this MMIO BAR.
Potential Effect On System
The AMD-8132 is a PCI-X® Mode 2 capable device and requires the MMIO BAR to support extended
configuration space. Using a device which does have this MMIO BAR and an AMD-8132 on the same
HyperTransportTM link of the processor may cause firmware/software problems.
The base configuration space of the AMD-8132 and PCI(-X) devices attached to it are accessible using only
the mechanism defined in PCI 2.3. Registers of PCI-X Mode 2 devices attached to the AMD-8132 in the
extended configuration space are not accessible. The AMD-8132 has no registers in the extended
configuration space.
Suggested Workaround
It is strongly recommended that system designers do not connect the AMD-8132 and devices that use extended
configuration space MMIO BARs (ex: HyperTransport-to-PCI Express® bridges) to the same processor
HyperTransport link.
Fix Planned
No
