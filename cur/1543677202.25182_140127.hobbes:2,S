Hi all, 
I've tried 2.5.70, 2.5.70-mm8 and 2.5.70-bk17.  All of them hang while
booting, the last message they display is "Uncompressing Linux... Ok,
booting the kernel." then they just sit blank and boot no further.  I've
booted previous 2.5.x kernels on this system, the last I had used was
2.5.63. My Hardware and other info is below, .config is attached. Is
anyone else experiencing this problem?  Is there any other information I
can provide to help debuging?  Please cc me any replies as my mailbox
can't take the full brunt of this mailing list, thanks -Dan
