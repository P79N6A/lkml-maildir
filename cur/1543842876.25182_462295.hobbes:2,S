There could be a default container which doesn't have any guarantee or
limit. When you create containers and assign guarantees to each of them
make sure that you leave some amount of resource unassigned. That
unassigned resources can be used by the default container or can be used
by containers that want more than their guarantee (and less than their
limit). This is how CKRM/RG handles this issue.
