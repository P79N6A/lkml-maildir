It's not theatrical.  It makes this code path extremely brittle and
very hard to change, which over the long term means that it is
impossible to maintain.  Quickly resulting in a state where any little
change will break something.  See Jeremy's impossible attempt to
detect if we start with physical addresses identity mapped or physical
address mapped at PAGE_OFFSET, just so he can clear the bss before we
test to see if we are running in para-virtualized environment.
The first step in making things better is removing this code (even in
your patches) so this patch doesn't get in the way.
We don't have any working code, there are no in tree users.
Therefore the code should go.
