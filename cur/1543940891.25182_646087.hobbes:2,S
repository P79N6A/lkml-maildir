Actually its probably the SYN/ACK that is dropped. Please try whether
modprobe ipt_LOG
echo 255 >/proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_log_invalid
and then running the test again logs something to the ring buffer.
You don't need to run the entire test, just until you get a log
message from conntrack.
