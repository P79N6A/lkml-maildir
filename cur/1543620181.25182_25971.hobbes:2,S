  Given that there is graphics stuff in there, and web server stuff, I
would say that having the system hang waiting for entropy is a performance
issue. And lack of it is a security issue.

  So a functional /dev/random would be a feature of power users installing
fixes, as opposed to the kernel using the available hardware? And having
one or more extra user space daemons crapping up the system doesn't seem
an issue?

  Not all Linux users are hackers, and depending on users to know their
hardware, find, build, install, and configure something, change ownership
of a device without messing it up, and understand that not doing so is
both a performance and security issue... seems either optimistic or just
unconcerned with the users.
