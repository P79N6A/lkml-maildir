Jean,
some comments, in no particular order :)
When I wrote the parallel port drivers, the parport api was changing a 
lot. Therefore I did not
make use of it. Blocking the parport might be a good idea, but it 
introduces another dependency.
Anyway, parport only makes real sense when you want to share your 
parport between multiple devices,
say a zip drive. Therefore, a question to the whole sensors list: Is 
anyone really using such a setup?
It should be at least be configurable as an option (also think of using 
it in embedded devices, where you
wouldn't want to bloat the kernel with such things...)
Also, are there any hardware cracks out there with multiple adapters, 
like a home-brew philips adapter
and a velleman kit on two parports?
Just a few special cases to think about...
As for the naming, i2c-parport would conflict with the old i2c-parport 
module that is still available in 2.4ish
kernels in the v4l section - maybe i2c-parallel is an option.
Also, have a look at the wealth of i2c drivers that are present in the 
2.6 kernels :)
So long,
Simon
