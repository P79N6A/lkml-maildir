Negative. Switching off export-option "no_subtree_check" (which basically leads
to more small allocs during nfs action) shows immediately mem failures and
truncated files on the server and stale nfs handles on the client. So the
system _is_ under pressure. This exactly made me start (my branch of) the
discussion.
Besides I would really like to know what useable _data_ is in these pages, as I
cannot see which application should hold it (the CD stuff was quit "long ago").
FS should have sync'ed several times, too.
