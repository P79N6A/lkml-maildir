Subject: [patch 044/104] xen: do not reserve 2 pages of padding between hypervisor and fixmap.

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Ian Campbell <Ian.Campbell@citrix.com>
commit 5dc64a3442b98eaa0e3730c35fcf00cf962a93e7 upstream.
When reserving space for the hypervisor the Xen paravirt backend adds
an extra two pages (this was carried forward from the 2.6.18-xen tree
which had them "for safety"). Depending on various CONFIG options this
can cause the boot time fixmaps to span multiple PMDs which is not
supported and triggers a WARN in early_ioremap_init().
This was exposed by 2216d199b1430d1c0affb1498a9ebdbd9c0de439 which
moved the dmi table parsing earlier.
    x86: fix CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW_64K=y
    The bad_bios_dmi_table() quirk never triggered because we do DMI setup
    too late. Move it a bit earlier.
There is no real reason to reserve these two extra pages and the
fixmap already incorporates FIX_HOLE which serves the same
purpose. None of the other callers of reserve_top_address do this.
