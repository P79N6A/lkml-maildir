Tim,
I've seen this problem too with my NE2000 clone. I'm also running
2.0.36, and I also chalked it up to a bad card. Except, I replaced to
old NE2000 clone with a new NE2000 clone. Same problem. Sometimes the
ethernet connection just dies for no reason. Now, occasionally it will
come back to life in a few seconds, but most of the time I need to
completely reboot the system (a complete power down). I'm not a kernel
hacker, so I have no idea what is causing the problem, but I thought I
should let those who do hack know there is a problem on at least two
computers here. :)
Later,
