Look at how it's done in do_gettimeofday (expand the macros). Note that
the USE_RTC was not yet perfect last time I looked at it: it should only
perform a test whenever 601 support is enabled (there are so many problems
with 601).
Don't forget that in the case of a 601, you have to shift the least
significant word right by 7 bits since the register increments by 128
every 128 nanoseconds. But the upper word changes more often...
However, it would perhaps be better to define the code as a macro in
asm-${ARCH}/whatever.h and fall back to jiffies in case the macro is not
defined. Arch dependent ifdef'ed code should be avoided.
