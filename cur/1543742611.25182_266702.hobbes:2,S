 the only problem is that it's a productive server with large, software
raid5 arrays and lockups can trigger resync`s that leads to a
significant performance degradation for days and the users really hates
this, so I'll try to reproduce it with another box on this weekend. if I
can't, I'll do it on the productive server and send the results..
