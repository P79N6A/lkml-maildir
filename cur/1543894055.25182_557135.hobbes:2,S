  Maybe a stupid idea but why do we want to assign these numbers by hand?
I can imagine it could introduce collisions when merging tons of patches
with new messages... Wouldn't it be better to compute say, 8-byte hash
from the message and use it as it's identifier? We could do this
automagically at compile time. I know it also has it's problems - you
fix a spelling and the message gets a different id and you have to
update translation/documentation catalogue but maybe that could be
solved too...
