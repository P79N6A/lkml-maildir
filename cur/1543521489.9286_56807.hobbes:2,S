When you say inodes, do you mean in ram or on disk or both?
Adding fields to the already bloated inode structure is (generally) not a good
thing.  It makes use of files for small objects less effective, which affects the
applicability of filesystems to new applications like web search engine indexes.
Why do you need it, I am curious?
I do not mean to be discouraging of someone cleaning up old datastructures and
making them better....
I just want to understand the change.  Is the intent to get rid of i_rdev and
replace it with i_bdev?
