I am not too deep into FS design, however I have heared from some admins of
a pretty busy server, that the allocation method of placinf file content
close to the directories cause a lot of fragmentation there. So I wonder if
an simple change in allocation policy could lower the problems with the
fragmentation and (especially) lower the chance of blocks beeing reused too
often.
I might be able to get  the patch, however I am not sure if it will solves
or lowers the problem the checker group found.
The performance impact of such a changed allocation policy is, however on
the given system positive (due to decreased fragmentation).
BTW: I was not directly involved here in the decision process which FS to
use, however I am sure it is both related to performance and recoverability.
Because all recent (journalling) filesystems XFS, Reiser and ext3 very often
failed with big data loss in that environment, whereas ext2 could most often
be recovered very well. So from my point of you ext2 should not be
desupported.
Greetings
Bernd
PS: i have a before/after screenshot of the filesystem in this german
article. It is a pop3 server:
