But init_timers() directly calls timer_cpu_notify(), which directly
calls init_timers_cpu().
So your patch appears to be a no-op for the boot CPU.

It should be OK as-is?  The CPU_UP_PREPARE callout is performed
before the secondary starts doing things.  Its timers are initialised.

But the patch assumes that the per-cpu data exists for all CPUs - even
the !cpu_possible() ones.
This is true at present.  But the intent here is that the per-cpu
storage be allocated as the CPUs come up, and in their node-local
memory.  That saves memory and presumably having the cpu-local timers
in the cpu-local memory is a good thing.
I have working code which did all that, but it sort-of got lost
because there was a lot going on at the time.
Have you actually observed any problem?
