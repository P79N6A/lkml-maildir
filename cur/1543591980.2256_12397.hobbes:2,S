Well, while that would be somewhat satisfying, there is a problem if
the message gets corrupted by this. And since some people send to the
list without being subscribed (or, like me, have duplicate filtering),
they'll never see that their message was mangled as it passed through
the list.
Nope, a bounce is better. If you're going to do these things, feedback
is essential. The bounce isn't meant to offend the sender, it's
designed to let them know what's happening.
