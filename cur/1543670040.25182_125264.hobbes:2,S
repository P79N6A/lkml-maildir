Well, the world today really knows ptp-type ethernet-interfaces in WAN
environment, this is where the question comes from. Think of simply a two-ended
bridged WAN connection. It is in fact (like) ptp.

That is only a _good_ alternative on first sight, but thinking again about it
you might as well say that in a rather big-sized WAN environment with lots of
hosts involved that route all kinds of private ips it is a really nice idea to
connect the interconnecting wan-boxes with ptp _not_ burning down additional
(private) subnets without real need. (remember, if you have lots of wan
connections you need lots of private subnets, but if you could use ptp you need
_none_)
