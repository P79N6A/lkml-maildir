This means that dd completed 100 reads, and none of them were of the
requested length (10000 bytes).

/dev/random generates (hopefully) truly random values, and relies on
receiving interrupts.  It doesn't spend very many CPU cycles.  For most
purposes, /dev/urandom is adequate, and will be much faster for such large
quantities of data.
