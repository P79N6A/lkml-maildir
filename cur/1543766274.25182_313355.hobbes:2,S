I am glad somebody is interested. ;-)

It's quite simple really. With this patch, does tdfxfb report the right amount 
of framebuffer memory for your card? The method it used to determine the 
amount of memory for the Voodoo4/5 before was wrong. If it gave the right 
value before, then it was probably just a coincidence.
Cheers,
