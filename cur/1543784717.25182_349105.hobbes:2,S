I used to have a patch to fix them, and sent it to Jeff ages ago. At that 
point, he didn't want to use the iomap() functionality, but maybe that has 
changed.
Jeff? It requires making almost all the SATA IO base pointers be iomapped: 
the current
	struct ata_ioports {
	        unsigned long           cmd_addr;
	        unsigned long           data_addr;
		...
would have to become
	struct ata_ioports {
		void __iomem *cmd_addr;
		void __iomem *data_addr;
		...
instead - and initialized with the proper ioport_map() or pci_iomap() as 
appropriate.
