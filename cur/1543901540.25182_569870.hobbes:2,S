Well, this is not how ACPI defines the S4 sleep state.  If the system is in
S4, that corresponds to our hibernation, you are _not_ allowed to disassemble
it.
I've just done an experiment on my test desktop.  I had enabled suspend support
in the CMOS setup and afterwards I made Linux hibernate in the "platform" mode.
Then, when the system was powred on, the BIOS showed me a nice "Resume from
hibernation" screen that is not normally displayed during boot.  This clearly
means that some information has been preserved by the platform across the
hibernate/restore cycle.  We are supposed to handle that.
