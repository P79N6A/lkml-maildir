hi,
has anyone experienced problems in increasing the "max" suffix
to the wait/nowait entry in inetd.conf?
I had to change it since the default-value (40 per minute) caused
trouble in extensively used rsh-calls to a production machine.
now it looks to me as I would get real trouble with the values 
I've choosen (400) to several services. it panics about once an 
hour with the famous "Aiee, killing interrupt handler".
it happens with different kernels, I tried 2.2.1, 2.2.7 and
2.2.7-ac4. 2.2.1 run stable for several weeks before.
I think this configuration was the only change to
the system and it was at the same day when "it" started.
I didn't made it so far to setup a serial logging machine
as recommended here. there is a huge hexdump style of output
that exeeds the screen - does it make any sense to
post just the "Code:..." line only?
