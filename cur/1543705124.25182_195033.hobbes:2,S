 The kernel does lot of activities, but if you mean console output, then
it doesn't start before the console driver is initialized, unless a
so-called initial console with a suitable driver is present, which may be
firmware-driven (so the driver may be a trivial redirector to appropriate
firmware callbacks).

 If there's no better console available, e.g. because there's no suitable
hardware present in the system or no drivers have been loaded, then the
dummy console is used -> drivers/video/console/dummycon.c.
 And if you worry of the messages being lost, then you can always retrieve
them from the kernel log buffer -- use `dmesg' for example. ;-)
