Indeed, mlock is a virtual pin and as such it won't be guaranteed to
always prevent migration. While get_user_pages is a physical pin on the
physical page so it has to prevent migration.
I think for him the physical pin is better since I guess IB would break
(at least unless you've some method to call to stop IB, adjust the IB
dma tracking, and restart IB, that hotplug can call). For the short term
using only get_user_pages sounds simpler IMHO.
