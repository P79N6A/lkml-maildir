It _is_ that simple.
The choices are:
 - let the caller do the locking
 - make the callee locking be statically determinable
Those are the choices. Your kind of code is not goign to be integrated.

This is trivially handled by splitting out the allocation as a separate 
phase. 
Yes, it requires that the caller be changed, but if the choice is between 
insane locking and making a caller change, then the choice is very very 
clear.

Don't.
Here's a big clue: if you make code worse than it is today, it won't be 
accepted. I don't even see why you'd bother in the first place.
So go back to the drawing board, and just do it _right_. Or don't do it at 
all. There's no point to making the code look and behave worse than it 
does today.
