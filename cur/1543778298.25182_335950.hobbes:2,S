I have couple of nitpicks (below) and one bigger concern - I am
surprised that a driver for a physical device is implemented as an
interface to a class device. This precludes implementing any kind of
power management in the driver and pushes it into the parent and is
generally speaking is a wrong thing to do (IMHO).
If the problem is that you have a single piece of hardware you need to
bind several drivers to - I guess you will have to create a new
sub-device bus for that. Or just register sub-devices on the same bus
the parent device is registered on - I am not sure what is best in
this particular case - I am not familiar with the arch. It is my
understanding that the purpose of interfaces to to present different
"views" to userspace and therefore they are not quie suited for what
you are trying to do...

Just move that assignment into ucb1x00_input_open and kill all this
"current" stuff.

Can we change this to "while (!kthread_should_stop())" to make me
completely happy?
Thanks!
