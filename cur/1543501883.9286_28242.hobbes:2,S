[Going offtopic] I guess it should be rather easy to write a shared
library or something the like that helps office software vendors write
their "Save" routine so that it creates a tgz file. This way, Joe User can
send it as one file if he likes, and Jack Expert can untar it and take a
look at it manually.
So this is rather a question of API evangelization. :-)
Anyone volunteering to write the lib?
