OK guys, thanks for all your replies.
What I have is the following.
I'm building a hard real-time Linux (RTLinux) system on a 2x Xeon machine. If 
I compile and run a 2.4.18 kernel with SMP support, rtlinux hangs the 
machine. However, with SMP disabled, rtlinux and all it's hard-realtime 
applications runs okay.
So, I have to deside between these two:
 - Run rtlinux and hard-realtime applications on a kernel without SMP support. 
How much performance will I loose this way? Is SMP *THAT* critical? 
 - Run all tasks in a usual way, no hard realtime, but with SMP support.
What would you suggest?
Also, if I turn hyperthreading off, how will it influence the system with SMP 
support? Without SMP support?
Thanks!
Artemio.
