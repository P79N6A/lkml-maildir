Reset means "power on, initialize power on state".  While shutdown in 
this way, the drive has shut down and is not drawing any power.  The 
reset is required to enable power flow into the drive again so it comes 
online.  Essentially you have a transistor disconnecting the power 
inside the drive, and the reset pulse flips that transistor.
