No.  It needs to do more than just behave as an in-memory filesystem: it
needs to behave like a block device.  That means that buffer cache
aliases of page cache data still need to work: you need to be able to
run dump or fsck on the ramdisk of a mounted filesystem, for example.
Using a ramdisk to test fs utilities is a legitimate use, and if you
move the ramdisk out of the buffer cache it will just break this (as
well as polluting the page cache semantics).
