Hi,
I have frequent freezes with the following setup:
- IDE (PIIX)
- MD (RAID 1)
- SMP (2 CPUs)
- kernel 2.6.14.x
If I unmount the RAID partitions everything is fine (tested on the same 
machine and on a pure SCSI twin). Heavy activity on the IDE disks doesn't 
trigger the problem.
2.6.13.x and 2.6.15-rc5 work flawlessly.
I have many other servers with MD on SCSI and SMP or MS on IDE not SMP. This 
is the only one that has this problem.
Having a working 2.6.15, I shouldn't whine, but I didn't see any bug fixes 
specific to this bug.
Did anyone experience the same problem?
