Magallón, does the attached patch fix the problem?
Alan, it seems that 0x848a indicates CFA device iff the ID data is from 
IDENTIFY DEVICE.  When the command is IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE, 0x848a 
seems to indicate a valid ATAPI device.
 From ATA8-ACS, 7.17 is IDENTIFY DEVICE.

And, 7.18 is on IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE.

So, when the output is from IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE, 0x848a doesn't have 
any special meaning.  It indicates a valid write-once, removable media, 
ATAPI device with 16bytes CDB.
The attached patch makes sanity checking logic in ata_dev_read_id() 
check for CFA only if IDENTIFY DEVICE is used.
Thanks.
