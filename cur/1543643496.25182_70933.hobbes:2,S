You got me.  First I haven't looked at it yet (this week though)
and second, I have heard that the scsi mid layer is actually pretty
nice.  The "festering sore" part is really the fact we don't use it
for IDE as well.

Yup, I know, retracted, back to our regular programming.

I distinctly heard him say he wanted the scsi mid layer repurposed as
an interface for all disks.  Maybe he changed his mind?

Ah, we could use more summaries like that.
Well, you're looking at the situation from the block IO maintainer's
point of view.  We also need certain scsi-style functionality available
across all disk systems, such as barriers in a form usable by
filesystems.  Maybe you *can* suck all that functionality into the
block layer, but maybe it needs higher level support as well.  I'll
bet on the latter, and I won't have to speculate, pretty soon.

My own goal is certainly not limited to making the thing work.  I need
to *understand* these systems, because they are important to what I'm
doing and right now they are a big, black hole somewhere over in the
south end of the kernel.

Jens, we just got a whole lot clearer than your "no, don't bother,
possibly" post.  Such posts may feel good to write, but they're not
very helpful.

Counts as more talk ;-)
