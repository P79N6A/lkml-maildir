You're assuming the server will remove setuid and setgid bits on WRITE?
I don't see that behaviour specified in the RFC, at least for v3.
The RFC specifies a behaviour for the mtime attribute as a side
effect of WRITE, but says nothing about mode.  This means server
implementations are free to clobber setuid or not.  A quick experiment
shows that at least the Irix server will *NOT* clobber those bits.
So with an Irix server you've now lost this Linux-specific "security
feature".
I'm curious about the reasons behind this change.  You mention
credential issues; how exactly is it that you have the correct creds
to perform a WRITE rpc but not a SETATTR rpc?
Greg.
