eh no. It defaults to zero, but if you increase it for a specific user, that
user is allowed to mlock more.

that is so not a constructive way to make progress. 
The realtime LSM is the wrong concept. It's a hack to work around other
design issues with linux. *THAT* is what makes it wrong. Not the fact that
it wouldn't work (I believe it works, I don't think anyone doubts that
much). If you are unwilling to even discuss fixing the underlying design
issues then I'm scared that this issue will never come to any workable
solution.
