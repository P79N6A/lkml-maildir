Yes, which is why I don't agree with Hollis about having that in
bus_type, but rather in the device itself and inherit from the
parents by default ;) (Hrm... did I repeat myself ?)
The bus_type was is pretty useless for things like USB, and we
may have several controllers of the same bus with different
caracteristics (an on-chip OHCI and a PCI EHCI comes to mind)
Hrm... reading your last sentence, it seems you don't want people
to pass the struct device of the USB device but the host one instead,
fair enough...
