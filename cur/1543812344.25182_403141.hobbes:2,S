On this double Xeon, yes.  I had no problems before with 2.6.12 and the
same "heavy" software on dual Opteron and dual dual core Opteron
machines, and this is my first installation on a EM64T.
At first it seemed everything was ok with 2.6.12 here too, but in a
couple of days we started gettings some of those oom killings when
running some Gaussian jobs. In at least a pair of cases the system froze
completely.

Added it and already got output for a similar "killing". Since I'm not
sure what could be most relevant among those messages, I refrained from
attaching them all here, and instead put them at
http://jmce.artenumerica.org/tmp/linux-2.6.12-oom_killings/EM64T-kern.log

Do those call traces suggest that uncorrected bug you mention?
(And if yes, is there any known way to mitigate the problem? Could it
depend on BIOS settings?)
I'll also be able to try a 2.6.15 kernel (eventually with any suggested
patches) later today...
Thanks again and best regards
