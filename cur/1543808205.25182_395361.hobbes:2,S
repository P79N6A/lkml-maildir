Dear Friend,
May this mail find you well and in good spirit in jesus 
name.
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds 
transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay. 
Presently, i'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of 
the total sum. meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts 
to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some 
how.
Now contact my secretary in Benin, his name is Mr.Henry.Onyema,on 
Email: barr_honyema@yahoo.com
ask him to send you the total of 
$400.000.00 which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts 
and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at 
that time very much. so feel free and get in touched with my secretary  
Henry.Onyema, and instruct him where to send the amount to you.
Please, do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share 
the joy after all the sufferness at that time. in the moment, I’m very 
busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new 
partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded 
instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so 
feel free to get in touch with Mr. Henry.Onyema, he will send the 
amount to you without any delay. 
Your's sincerely,
Mrs.Fatima
