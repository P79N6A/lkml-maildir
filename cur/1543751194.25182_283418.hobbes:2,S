In addition to 'gpart' you can try 'rescuept' which is part of
util-linux collection.   Each of these may rescue your corrupt partition
table.  
Do you have any idea of the partitioning schema?  Number of partitions,
size, etc.?
If both fail to reconstruct the partition table you can work with a
forensic utility such as SMART for Linux (www.asrdata.com) or The Sleuth
Kit (www.sleuthkit.org) to recover your files.  Depending upon the FS
TYPE(s) you may even get deleted files back.  
No matter though, once you get everything worked out back up your
partition table using 'sfdisk' and/or dd and dump that to a safe place
(external media) so that if this happens in future you can reconstruct
easily!
