Ok given
	writel(foo, dev->reg);
	udelay(5);
	writel(bar, dev->reg);
The pci bridge is at liberty to delay the first write until the second or a
read from that device comes along (and wants to do so to merge bursts). It
tends to bite people
	-	When they do a write to clear the IRQ status and don't do
		a read so they keep handling lots of phantom level triggered
		interrupts.
	-	When there is a delay (reset is common) that has to be observed
	-	At the end of a DMA transfer when people unmap stuff early
		and the "stop the DMA" command got delayed
