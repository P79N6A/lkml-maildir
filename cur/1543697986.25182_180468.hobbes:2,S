I may be missing something but I dont see how this fixes the original
problem that we started with.
The system has a large number of nodes. Physically, each node has the same 
amount of memory.  After boot, we observe that several nodes have 
substantially less memory than other nodes. Some of the inbalance is
due to the kernel data/text being on node 0, but by far, the major source 
of in the inbalance is the 3 (in 2.4.x) large hash tables that are being 
allocated. 
I suspect the size of the hash tables is a lot bigger than is needed. 
That is certainly the first problem to be fixed, but unless the 
required size is a very small percentage (5-10%) of the amount of memory 
on a node (2GB to 32GB per node & 256 nodes), we still have a problem.
We run large MPI applications that place threads onto each node. Each
thread needs the same amount of local memory. The maximum problem size 
that can be efficiently solved is limited by the amount of free memory 
on the smallest node. We need an allocation scheme that doesn't deplete
a significant amount of memory from any single node.
