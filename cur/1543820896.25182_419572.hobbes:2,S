Not clear is you mean "allow that to the the only selection" which it 
does, or "only allow that selection" which makes no sense, you can boot 
using any compiled scheduler.
My configuration for beverage is set to "cask conditioned IPA" but I 
have most of the "Microbrewed" selections for IPA, PA, Stout and Porter 
compiled in. The "bland American and imported brews" section is 
disabled, with "water" enabled as a module.
The preference is what you use by default, but not an irrevocable choice.
