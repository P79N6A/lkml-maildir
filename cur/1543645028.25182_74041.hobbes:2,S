well, 4 fields: ->mapping, ->list.next, ->list.prev, ->index and ->private
is *alot* of space to do something smart in struct page itself.
(hm, dont we have named anonymous mappings? (ie. mmap()-ing of a file via
MAP_PRIVATE?) And if a futex is put there it can be COW-ed, right, while
it's also in the pagecache?)
assuming those 4 fields are available, it should be easy for the futex
code to detect such mappings - the ->mapping field should be a good test,
if it's NULL then it's a COW-able page, if it's non-NULL then not.
then eg. the ->private field could be used as a simple PG_sticky counter.
or, to implement real lazy COW, the ->private field could be used as an
'owner MM' pointer, and if the COW handler sees current->mm == owner_mm,
then the ->list has a queue of pending page_change_struct's, which would
trigger a rehashing of the futexes. Then PG_sticky is cleared.
this would work fine as long as the pin_page code guarantees to never put
a hash on an already COW-ed page. (which can be guaranteed by using the
'writable' flag to get_user_pages())
no additional hashes. Is there any danger in going into this direction?
