Since relatively recently, powerpc does no longer actually disable
the hardware interrupts with local_irq_disable(), but rather sets
a per-cpu flag that will be checked if an actual interrupt comes
in as part of the critical section.
The mtmsr() sequence in xmon corresponds to hard_irq_disable()
and should probably changed to that, but then you still need
the extra preempt_disable() / preempt_enable().
I think you're right about the sequence having to be
1. preempt_disable()
2. hard_irq_disable()
3.
4. hard_irq_enable()
5. preempt_enable()
