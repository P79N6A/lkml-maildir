We really should do this.  It's a question of timing and phasing.
The <unknown quantity of> applications out there which are reading
the disk info from /proc/stat need to be taught to go fishing in
/name-of-the-day-fs.
And that's hard.  /driverfs? /sys? /sysfs? /kernfs?  AFAIK we don't
even have a recommended mountpoint for the thing, do we?  One way
to resolve that is for the monitoring application to locate the
mountpoint by consulting /proc/mounts on startup.
So what do people think?  Do we just peremptorily nuke it and let
the world catch up, or is a more organised migration possible?
Rick, I believe you've hunted down some other apps which are using this
info. sysstat, sar, mpstat, various flavours of iostat.  Where do
we stand on getting those updated?
Thanks.
