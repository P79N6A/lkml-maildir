Only when a process can have one gid.
This usually means a single user/application system, in which case you
still can't determine which process to kill since they are all in the same
group.
Most production shops I have worked in requires multiple groups per user,
which gets translated into multiple GIDs per process. This defeats your
use of GIDs for resource allocation.
