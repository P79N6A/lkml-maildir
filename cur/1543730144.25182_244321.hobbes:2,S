I'd refer to a computer as a large computer when its calculation power
is several times  larger than the one home computers  of the same time
have (or if  it's a really large machine, such  as the Honeywell DDPs,
but that's another dimension of "large").

A market  segment not  reaching waste portions  of all customers  in a
market. Think of catfood.

Linux is  actually widely employed  in the home computer  *and* server
market,  plus embedded  devices.  I  mean, did  you  ever see  someone
running Solaris on their video decoder?

Intel 8086  processor with  a few ko  of RAM,  with a floppy  drive, a
monitor and a floppy, I think. If you take only the normal kernel into
account that will be an 80386 processor.

At least more RAM and a more capable processor.

Greeeat. I can do that too on my Powerbook G5.
