Well, I've never seen this particular one reported anywhere through
2.2.  What you are looking at seems to be:
> eax: e0292c18   ebx: 00000008   ecx: e0292c18   edx: c0fc15c0
       ^                               ^
single-bit memory corruption.  The usual suspects in these cases are
overheated CPU, or memory.  Disable L1 and/or L2 cache often clears
things up (and points to the fault).
