FYI: I've already implemented this *simplest* form for .tar.gz files. A
patch can be found here:
http://www.escape.de/users/outback/linux/patch-2.4.17-inittar.gz
(I could also prepare a patch against 2.5.x)
So, before starting to implement the initramfs stuff, may be you should
have a look on my version.
Changing it from .tar to .cpio (if required) shouldn't be too difficult.
