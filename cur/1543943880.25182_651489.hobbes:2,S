Subject: [PATCH] [3/8] CPA: Test the correct mapping alias on x86-64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/56

static_protections previously would test against the x86-64 kernel mapping 
twice. First against the unchanged symbol directly from the linker (which
always points into the kernel mapping) and then again it would manually
relocate the address into the kernel mapping and test again.
This patch reverses the second test instead to test against the direct mapping
(low) aliases virtual addresses which was probably intended in the first place.
Simply use __pa and __va for that.
This also allows to drop an ifdef because it will work both on 32bit and 64bit.
