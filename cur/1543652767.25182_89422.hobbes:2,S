Linus, please also consider LTT. The benefits might not be immediately 
visible, but it's great tool to the analyze system behaviour, which can 
even be used by non kernel hackers. This means as soon normal users start 
testing 2.5, they're not limited to fuzzy error messages, but they can 
tell you what actually happens, when the system doesn't "feel" right.
bye, Roman
