    Yes, I understand. That's worse than I thought. I was right now
thinking about "PortableApps", a set of free software applications that
are a little bit modified to work from a pendrive in Windows. Very
useful, because you can carry your OpenOffice (or AbiWord) and Firefox,
for example, to any Windows you're doomed to use. This applications
write repeteadly to the pendrive (specially Firefox...), and I think
they may wear the drive prematurely if used extensively.

    So you have a zone which is unusable. Decent filesystems allow you
to mark some blocks as "dontuse" (ext2, for example). Does FAT allow
this?

    Yes, I know. I wasn't aware of the local wear leveling. Thanks a lot
for explaining, I will be much more gentle with my pendrives O:))

    I think I will be writing the pendrive, almost fully, once a week
(enough for an image of my home directory). That means less than 1GiB
written each week. That means 50-100 (in the worst case, making two
backups a week instead of one) writings each year in each block.

    Oh, sorry, now I understand :))

    That's the kind of information you never want anywhere when
investigating, so I'm very grateful for that, really :)
