Hi..
Are there any know failure modes causing ext2 corruption in 2.3.20?
I notces 'file switcharound' on a test system. I found the contens of a
file saved from gimp had replaced a file I was downloading in netscape.
While the actual file being saved was truncated to zero bytes.
I'm going to upgrade, but if this isn't a known failure state, I'll do
whatever is needed to reproduce it and help track it down.
Nothing of intrest was recorded in system logs.
System is PII/400 w/ 256ram 128swap.
