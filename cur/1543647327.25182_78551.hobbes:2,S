Hello,
What kind of CPU and hard drive do your two machines above have?  I'm
a developer for arch[1], and I'm wondering how fast things can get.
Note: If you answer, you'll certainly be aiding arch development.  It
      might be interpreted as "develop[ing] ... a product which
      contains substantially similar capabilities of the BitKeeper
      Software, or, in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, competes
      with the BitKeeper Software".  So you might lose the ability to
      use the free license.  But I'll let you decide if you want to
      help us.
Thank you,
Walter Landry
