I've been thinking about fabricating my own hardware for a pc104 board 
that uses a 16-bit ISA bus.  Basically, I want to interface a DSP 
such that it has access to the pc104's shared memory.  I'm fairly 
confident that I can work out the circuit design, but I need to know 
more about Linux's ISA support.
1) What is needed to support ISA bus-mastering?  I would like the ISA 
device to write directly to the pc104's shared memory.
2) What memory regions can I write to?  Am I limited to <16MB or is it 
more restrictive?  64K-1MB, 15-16MB?
3) How can I reserve a specific memory region?  How much memory can I 
use?  I plan to have a way to communicate to the DSP (via I/O) what 
memory address to access.
4) How do I enable a 16-bit DMA channel?  Do I need to do anything 
beyond enabling DMA?
5) What are some good examples?
6) What else should I be thinking about?
Thanks!
