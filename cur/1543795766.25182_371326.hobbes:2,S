A config issue? It says 'choose M' which is not offered. Maybe it is just
an option for the bt8xx driver, which itself can be built as a module
(CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848)?
  DVB/ATSC Support for bt878 based TV cards (VIDEO_BT848_DVB) [N/y/?] (NEW) ?
This adds support for DVB/ATSC cards based on the BT878 chip.
To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called dvb-bt8xx.
