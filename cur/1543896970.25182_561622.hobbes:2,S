What exactly is missing here?  A dep on X86?  This would indicate the
arches on which the driver has actually been tested.  But which arches
are supported and which aren't is, in the end, up to the userspace helper.

Hmm, I guess I could make it a hard-coded value, but paths to userspace 
helpers should generally be configurable, right?

OK, I'll include a more detailed description in the next round of the
patches.

AFAIK, it can't.  PMI code is meant to be run in 32-bit protected mode.
I'll add a note about this to the patch and change __i386__ to
CONFIG_X86_32.

Thanks, I'll do that.

Fixed.  This was a leftover from vesafb.c.  Are there any reasons for not
fixing it there as well?

True, but it would also make uvesafb the only (?) fb driver that
doesn't support the "video=smthfb:<options>" way of setting options.
Unless it's considered deprecated, I think it would be best to leave
it as it is, for the sake of consistency.
Thanks for all your comments & suggestions, and I'm sorry for the screw-up
with checkpatch.pl.  I've fixed the code in my git tree and the updates
will be included in the next version of this patch.
Best regards,
Michal
