Ok, I'm convinced. This change would make more sense but with direct users 
of mem_map, it is incomplete.

That's not the assumption users of mem_map[] are making.

mel@arnold:~/linux-2.6.17-mm6-clean/include/asm-cris$ grep -r ARCH_PFN_OFFSET *
page.h:#define ARCH_PFN_OFFSET          (PAGE_OFFSET >> PAGE_SHIFT)
mel@arnold:~/linux-2.6.17-mm6-clean/arch/cris$ grep -r mem_map *
arch-v10/mm/init.c:      * mem_map page array.
arch-v32/mm/init.c:      * saves space in the mem_map page array.
arch-v32/mm/init.c:     mem_map = contig_page_data.node_mem_map;
mm/init.c:              if (PageReserved(mem_map+i))
mm/init.c:              else if (PageSwapCache(mem_map+i))
mm/init.c:              else if (!page_count(mem_map+i))
mm/init.c:              else if (page_count(mem_map+i) == 1)
mm/init.c:                      shared += page_count(mem_map+i) - 1;
mm/init.c:      if(!mem_map)
mm/init.c:              if (PageReserved(mem_map + tmp))
That would be a no. In the example of cris and elsewhere, show_mem() walks 
the mem_map array from max_mapnr to 0. If mem_map had been offset by 
ARCH_PFN_OFFSET during init, the first call to show_mem() would have had 
interesting results.

Whether it should be avoided now or not, mem_map[] is walked directly. 
Historically, it was fine to do this. The full patch would need to do 
something like
o Rename mem_map to __mem_map[] to break incorrect users at compile time
o #define MEM_MAP (__mem_map + ARCH_PFN_OFFSET)
o Change all direct users of mem_map to MEM_MAP
While not exactly complicated, is it worth it?

It's what happens thoug: ARCH_PFN_OFFSET != 0 and mem_map[0] is used.

Good job they don't do that :/
