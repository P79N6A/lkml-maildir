Hmm...my reasoning is that those switches are unnecessary because the
interactivity bonus/penalty will take care of breaking the timeslices up in
case of a CPU hog, albeit not at precise 25 ms granularity.  Though having
regularity in scheduling is nice, I think Ingo's patch somewhat negates the
purpose of having heterogenous time slice lengths.  I suspect Ingo's
approach will thrash the caches quite a bit more than mine; we should
definitely test this a bit to find out for sure.  Any suggestions on how to
go about that?
If we're going to do a context switch every 25 ms no matter what, we might
as well just make the scheduler a true real time scheduler, dump having
different time slice lengths and interactivity recalculations, and go
completely round robin with strictly enforced priorities and a single class
of time slice somewhere 1 to 5 ms long.
