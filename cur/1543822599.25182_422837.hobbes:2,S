I want to say that I like the quick stable cycle. People like to see
fixes. Big thanks!
However...
I must say that usually I know if I need the the update,
eg. I do not care for SCTP that much so I could skip that update.
But this one looks important, something that every kernel build
has in its code path, however I am unable to say if I need it badly
or maybe not.
The url: 
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1860
says nothing about it.
Could we have a word or two under each patchlet that would qualify them
somehow?
Like:
"Important, not required for all, apply if using SCTP"
"Important, required for all, may *do bad things*, apply ASAP"
"Critical, required for all, surely will *do bad things*, apply ASAP"
Not only distro kernel developers/maintainers use these, so I think
it would be nice.
Best Regards,
Maciej
