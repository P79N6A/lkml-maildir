I have an Compaq Armada M700, same problem. No ACPI configured,
symtoms vary a bit from kernel to kernel, but generally either
keyboard is totally dead, or it starts to get utterly confused about
caps lock and shift.
On 2.5.10-dj1 it works like this: keyboard led is responsive to
hitting caps lock, but when LED is off I get upper case letter typed,
and when LED is off I get lower case letters. However, the strange bit
is that lets say I type in my username and password so that they
appear in lowercase on the screen, I still don't get in. And just fir
having tried, typing with the caps lock LED off, thus getting upper
case text, doesn't help either.
Any pointer to where I go off to track this down?
ttfn,
