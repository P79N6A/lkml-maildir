Sorry about that, the dump I got from the one who found the problem didn't
include the SYN's.. I'll dig it up

It ends where the dump ends, nothing is sent for the 10 minutes until the
FIN packet. It seems as if Linux fills up the receive window and sits
there, it ignores the ACK's (if they get there).

Me too, especially since the dump was made on the windows machine itself..
it just seemed funny that it all works fine when the connection is
restarted (network elements not operating at or above OSI 3 would not know
the difference...). I'll see if I can get a dump "in between".
