A new modem driver for the Diamond Supra Pro SST DF has been created,
to get a copy, mail me to become a tester.
Sent it again in case people were put off reading the mail from that
crap NTL account of mine.
This is significant, because I BACKWARDS engineered the WINMODEM to
do it. This should speed development up (of winmodems).
Works on 2.5.** (made for 2.5.33, really, but works on others).
Anyone who tests it gets a free lolly. Perhaps not.
Cheers, Dean.
Currently about to collapse from exhaustion.
