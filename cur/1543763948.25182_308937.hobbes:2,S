Hrm. Something changed between the last -mm release which compiled 
through, and this one..
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   CHK     usr/initramfs_list
   GEN     .version
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   UPD     include/linux/compile.h
   CC      init/version.o
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1823): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_table_init'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1828): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_init'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
[root@tornado linux-2.6]#
Backing out bk-acpi.patch works around it..
