Can't be, the customers (real ones - board makers) would kill them
at once and then buy a different brand. That's not selling a different
wifi card under the old name.
Anyway, I just connected a programmer to the EEPROM (machine "a" in my
previous mail = EPIA-M 600 MHz), wrote "8" to the 16-bit word at address
0x11 (93c46 EEPROM), and now this VT6307S dated 0239CD (2002, 39th week)
says:
ohci1394: fw-host0: OHCI-1394 1.1 (PCI): IRQ=[12]  MMIO=[de000000-de0007ff]
  Max Packet=[2048]  IR/IT contexts=[4/8]
Unfortunately it's not much good for general consumption, and I haven't
yet found a way to write to the EEPROM using VT6307 registers (one can
easily read it using documented GUID register).
Nobody with a good VIA contact?
I'm not asking for something extraordinary, am I?
