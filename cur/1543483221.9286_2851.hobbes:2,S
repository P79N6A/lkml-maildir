But why compile a kernel on that machine? A compiled 2.2 kernel is not
very big at all. You can download binary packages for populer
distributions, or someone could probably compile a custom kernel for you.

My mailserver is running 2.1.125, no problem. It is a 486 dx2/66 with 270
mb disk. It is also a print server, dialup server.

Maybe we could have a sepperate tar ball with the configuration stuff in
it. Then you could make a .config file and send it to someone for
compiling. It could even be made automatic. You send your .config to an
email address, and it mails you the kernel.
