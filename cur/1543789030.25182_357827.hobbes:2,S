Subject: [PATCH 07/21] mm: mm_struct hiwaters moved
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/12/215

Slight and timid rearrangement of mm_struct: hiwater_rss and hiwater_vm
were tacked on the end, but it seems better to keep them near _file_rss,
_anon_rss and total_vm, in the same cacheline on those arches verified.
There are likely to be more profitable rearrangements, but less obvious
(is it good or bad that saved_auxv[AT_VECTOR_SIZE] isolates cpu_vm_mask
and context from many others?), needing serious instrumentation.
