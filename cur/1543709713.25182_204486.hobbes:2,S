we agree that this all is not an issue, but the reasons are different 
from what you describe.
wall_jiffies (and, more importantly, xtime.tv_sec - which is the clock
source used by sys_time()) is updated from hardirq context - so softirq
delay cannot impact it.
gettimeofday() and time() are unsynchronized clocks, and time() will
almost always return a time less than the current time - due to rounding
down.
in the moments where there's a timer IRQ pending (or the timer IRQ's
time update effect is delayed eg. due to contention on xtime_lock)
gettimeofday() can estimate the current time past the timer tick, at
which moment the inaccuracy of time() can be briefly higher than 1
second. (in most cases it should be 1 second + delta)

nobody should rely on gettimeofday() and time() being synchronized on
the second level. Typically the delta will be [0 ... 0.999999 ] seconds,
occasionally it can get larger.
and this has nothing to do with using vsyscalls and it can already
happen. xtime.tv_sec is used without any synchronization so even if
xtime were synchronized with gettimeofday() [eg. by do_gettimeofday()
noticing that xtime.tv_sec needs an update] - the access is not
serialized on SMP.
