Subject: Q: behaviour of mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) and VM_GROWSDOWN segments

If an app has an VM_GROWS{DOWN,UP} stack and calls
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE|MCL_CURRENT), which pages should the kernel lock?
* grow the vma to the maximum size and lock all.
* just according to the current size.
What should happen if the segment is extended by more than one page
at once? (i.e. a function with 100 kB local variables)
* Just allocate the page that is needed to handle the page faults
* always fill holes immediately.
Right now segments are not grown during the mlockall syscall. Some
codepaths fill holes (find_extend_vma()), most don't (page fault
handlers)
What's the right thing (tm) to do?
I don't care which implementation is choosen, but IMHO all
implementations should be identical
