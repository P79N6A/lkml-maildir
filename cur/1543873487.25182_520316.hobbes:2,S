At the moment, "no".
With this quick hack, it will work, and I'm sure someone can come up
with a better idea.
Currently, the "make cscope" and "make TAGS" only get the files that are
physically located in the arch. As I mentioned to Ingo, it took me an
hour when I first looked for early_printk. Since it wasn't in the TAGS
and my own search scripts were also arch specific.  I was working in
i386, and early_printk is not.
But here's a hack that will let both x86_64 and i386 see the same code
in the common area for a "make cscope" or "make TAGS".
