No, the compiler is correct, it has to generate more complex code
if it cannot assume that data is naturally aligned and the architecture
does not support unaligned loads. If you don't understand this, please
at least read the list archives about the last five times this came up
before claiming that the compiler is broken.

Again, you are missing the point. The patch has to leave out the padding
and whatnot because the idea of the patch is to provide a
backwards-compatible API for programs written against the legacy XFS
API. The original definition of the interface was flawed, but unless you
can travel back in time to complain about this in the initial submission
of the XFS file system, you should not blame the entirely correct patch now.
