For grins, I did `dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1024 count=4000000` 
Obviously, with the limits of ext2, this isn't allowed, however, dd continued
marrily on its way, tho it spouted an error...
I cancelled the dd and went to remove the file, though the following occured:
root@obfuscated:/home/ftp# rm testfile
rm: cannot remove `testfile': Value too large for defined data type     
'ls' complains about the same.  I ran e2fsck -f /dev/hde6 (the partition of
/home) and it didn't 'find' the problem.
How do I remove this file and reclaim the HDD space?
Thanks,
D.
