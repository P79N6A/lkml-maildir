Subject: [PATCH 1/5] mm: update split ptlock Kconfig

Closer attention to the arithmetic shows that neither ppc64 nor sparc
really uses one page for multiple page tables: how on earth could they,
while pte_alloc_one returns just a struct page pointer, with no offset?
Well, arm26 manages it by returning a pte_t pointer cast to a struct
page pointer, harumph, then compensating in its pmd_populate.  But
arm26 is never SMP, so it's not a problem for split ptlock either.
And the PA-RISC situation has been recently improved: CONFIG_PA20 works
without the 16-byte alignment which inflated its spinlock_t.  But the
current union of spinlock_t with private does make the 7xxx struct page
significantly larger, even without debug, so disable its split ptlock.
