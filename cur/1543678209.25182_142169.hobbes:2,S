Alright, I've got a first pass at a patch that might solve this. 
This patch detects if we have 100 consecutive interrupts that find lost
ticks. If that occurs, we assume that the TSC is changing frequency and
we fall back to the PIT for a time source (equiv to booting w/
clock=pit). 
I'd like to see this well tested as I don't want to prematurely disable
the TSC if lost ticks is just doing its job, but I also want to catch
speedstep cpus before folks notice time going out of control. So the #
of consecutive interrupts may need adjusting. 
thanks
