For the "it hangs" case, short of either trying to boot with the
console I/O redirected to a serial port or hooking up a printer to
the console and scanning in the resulting output, I don't think so.
There's too much output prior to the hang point to make manual
transcription feasible.

I'll build a post-"bad"-commit kernel later this evening and let you
know.  Unfortunately, real life has to intrude for a few hours :-).
If specifying the clocksource allows for a normal bootup, would you
like to see the corresponding dmesg output?
