Thanks, I understand what's happening in 2.6. So I think there might be 
a problem with 2.4.23 then. In mpparse.c :
void __init MP_processor_info (struct mpc_config_processor *m)
{
int ver, quad, logical_apicid;
if (!(m->mpc_cpuflag & CPU_ENABLED))
return;
logical_apicid = m->mpc_apicid;
if (clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_NUMAQ) {
quad = translation_table[mpc_record]->trans_quad;
logical_apicid = (quad << 4) +
(m->mpc_apicid ? m->mpc_apicid << 1 : 1);
printk("Processor #%d %s APIC version %d (quad %d, apic %d)\n",
m->mpc_apicid,
mpc_family((m->mpc_cpufeature & CPU_FAMILY_MASK)>>8 ,
(m->mpc_cpufeature & CPU_MODEL_MASK)>>4),
m->mpc_apicver, quad, logical_apicid);
.....
and later in same function :
phys_cpu_present_map |= apicid_to_phys_cpu_present(m->mpc_apicid);
but _not_
phys_cpu_present_map |= apicid_to_phys_cpu_present(logical_apicid);
as one would expect (and would make it identical to 2.6 behaviour).... A 
bug?
