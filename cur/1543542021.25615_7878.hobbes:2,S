Agreed. 
Part of my suggestion is that there may be more than one "I got input"
routines. 
Some devices may not be able to provide more than one char at a
time. Think 8250.
	ser_got_one_char (inb (port->base + DATA));
Others like CD1864 may be able to provide us with a number of valid
chars before we read them from the data register:
	nvc = inb (port->base + NR_VALID_CHARS);
	ser_got_chars_in_one_ioreg (port->base + DATA, nvc);
I also have a driver that would need:
	nchars = readb (port->base + CHARS_IN_BUFFER)
	ser_got_chars_in_iomem (port->base + BUFFER, nchars);
You'r suggesting that you'd like to do:
	nchars = readl (port->base + CUR_DMA_POINTER) - port->cur_buf;
	ser_got_chars_in_mem (port->cur_buf, nchars);
	port->cur_buf = kmalloc (BUFSIZE);
	writel (port->base + CUR_DMA_POINTER, virt_to_bus (port->cur_buf));
Now having something like skbuffs internally may make more sense if
you think about passing those buffers around. Point is: the driver
shouldn't need to know.
