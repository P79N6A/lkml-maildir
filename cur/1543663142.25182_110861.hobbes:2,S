Have you tested this with older compilers?
In particular, I have this dim memory of gcc historically not liking 
multiple separate __attribute__ bits, ie
	__attribute__((unused,__section__ ...))
would be fine, but
	__attribute__((unused)) __attribute__((__section__ ...))
would not compile.
But hey, my brain is cabbage, and my memory might be crap.
