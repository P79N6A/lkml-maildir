It won't.  There isn't really a sane way of doing this properly unless
we do something like:
1) Add a new flag to the superblock
2) Set that flag against all r/w superblocks before starting the sync
3) Use that flag inside the superblock walk.
That would provide a reasonable solution, but I don't believe we
need to go to those lengths in 2.4, do you?
