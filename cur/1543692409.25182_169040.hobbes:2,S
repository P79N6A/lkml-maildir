Mingo suggested to upgrade XFree86-4.3.0-33 from rawhide so I can
test and use his exec-shield. I went further and upgraded some more
packages: glibc*-2.3.2-91, nptl-devel-2.3.2-91, nscd-2.3.2-91,
rpm-4.2.1-0.30 (so I don't need LD_ASSUME_KERNEL as root)
and finally: gnome-terminal-2.4.0.1, vte[-devel]-0.11.10-4.
It fixed the problem.
