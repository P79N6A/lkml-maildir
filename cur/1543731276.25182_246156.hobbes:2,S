Probably not. Anticipatory (as) scheduler is the default, so unless you 
specify elevator=cfq on the boot line (or are running a patched kernel), 
you will be using that.
You can look at the kernel boot messages to find out, or do the 
following in a shell after booting:
# dmesg|grep "io scheduler"
