I understand the problem, but I think the solution is all backwards. 
The problem being that (DSP) chip vendors charge too much for their
product.  So, if you want a "real" modem you are going to have to pay
(you say) $50 to include it in a computer.  The issue though is that
you can apparently include a CPU that is sufficiently powerful enough
to do HSP and not have to pay for the DSP on the modem.  How can this
be?  How can Intel, AMD, whoever produce a CPU that is so powerful yet
so cheap that it makes more sense, economically, to move the 'SP
functions from a dedicated DSP chip inside the host CPU?  The answer is
simple, the DSP chip vendors are charging way too much for their
products.  When one technology (generic function CPU) can perform the
work of another (special function DSP's) at a lower cost overhead it is
obvious, from a capitalist supply and demand viewpoint, that the DSP
vendors are overcharging.
