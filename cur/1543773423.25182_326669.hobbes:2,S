When the _routing_ decision sends the packet to br0 (a bridge device),
it is unknown which bridge port(s) the packet will be sent out. This is
only known after the packet enters the bridge code. Therefore, for
iptables to know the bridge port out device, the hooks must be postponed
until in the bridge code.

Trust me, people will complain if they can no longer use the physdev
match for routed packets.
People using a bridging firewall will just have to live with the fact
that the reference is held until in the bridge code.
