Hi All:
For all those who are interested, the relayfs patch is now available for 
the 2.4 kernel from this link:
	
http://relayfs.sourceforge.net/
The patch is equivalent to relayfs from the 2.6.11-mm3 kernel. Earlier 
today I sent in the 2.4 port that mirrors relayfs from the 
2.6.13-rc5-mm1 kernel to the authors. So you can expect it to be up on 
sourceforge in a few days. If you cannot wait, feel free to ask me for it.
Thanks,
Hareesh
