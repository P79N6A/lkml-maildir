Hmm, not sure that works.
I have shell I used to freeze the ext3. Then it is pushed out by dirty
data waiting to be written to that ext3. Deadlock, with file
descriptor still open, and very hard to detect.
Ok, OOM killer will eventually hit the shell, close the fd and
unfreeze, but that is probably not what you want.
