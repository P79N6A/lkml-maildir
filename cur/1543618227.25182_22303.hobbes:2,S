To extend this a little further, for a normal PS/2 keyboard and mouse
setup you need to enable the following options (or load the appropriate
modules):
Input device support  --->
	Input core support			(input.o)	
	  Keyboard interface			(keybdev.o)
	  Mouse interface			(mousedev.o)
	Serial i/o support			(serio.o)
	  i8042 PC Keyboard controller		(i8042.o)
	Keyboards
	  AT keyboard support			(atkbd.o)
	Mice
	  PS/2 mouse				(psmouse.o)
Note that you also have to change XF86Config and GPM to use /dev/input/mice
instead of /dev/psaux.
