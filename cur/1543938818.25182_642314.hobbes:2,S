Yes, you don't need to expose the structure type, just name it, and then
define it in the code itself.
But using a void pointer as you have here, allows you to assign two
different types of structures to this pointer.  Are you sure that you
always get this right?  :)
Please, let's try to inforce type-saftey and set this to be a specific
type of pointer to a structure.  That will require you to possibly merge
the two structures, which will require some code changes.
