building vmlinux.o were moved up in the dependency chain so we started
to build it before the kallsym stuff. This was done to let modpost
report section mismatch bugs even when the final link failed.
Originally I had expected the dependency of $(kallsyms.o) to
cover this but it turns out that we need to be even more explicit.
With attached patch this is addressed and I now get the desired
behaviour.
The drawback is that the final steps are serialized and we seems
to be pretty CPU bound doing all the linking stuff.
I assume the patch is safe but a bit testing from your side
is appreciated.
That randconfig qa thing is excellent to find these subtle things.
