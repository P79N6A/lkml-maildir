Subject: [PATCH][2.5.22] fix x86 initrd breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus & Kai,
Summary: 2.5.17 broke initrd on x86. Fix below.
arch/i386/boot/Makefile sets RAMDISK := -DRAMDISK=512, so
bootsect.S puts 512 in the ram_size word.
At boot, arch/i386/kernel/setup.c reads ram_size (RAMDISK_FLAGS)
and extracts the low 11 bits (== 512) into rd_image_start.
init/do_mounts.c tries to find a gzip or FS image in /dev/ram
starting at block rd_image_start (512). It fails because
the image normally starts at block 0, and prints:
"RAMDISK: Couldn't find valid RAM disk image starting at 512."
Why: Kai's patch in 2.5.17 to move x86-specific options from
Makefile to arch/i386/boot/Makefile unfortunately lost the fact
that the orginal "#export RAMDISK = -DRAMDISK=512" statement
was commented out. (I suspect a typo.) RAMDISK is obsolete since
1.3.something, and uncommenting it has "interesting" effects
since the ram_size field has a very different meaning now.
The patch below reverts the statement to its pre-2.5.17 state.
Perhaps it should be removed altogether?
Cc: to Andi Kleen since it seems x86_64 also is affected by
this bug.
