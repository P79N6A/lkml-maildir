hrm.. thanks..
This is becomming odd...
   * If I specify the options during the lilo prompt, they
     are recognized (I used linux mca-pentium ide0=noprobe) and work!
   * If I add the following to lilo.conf:
     append ="mca-pentium ide0=noprobe", the mca-pentium is seen, but
     the ide0=noprobe isn't?!?
   * Switching the order to:
     append ="ide0=noprobe mca-pentium" doesn't work either!?!
