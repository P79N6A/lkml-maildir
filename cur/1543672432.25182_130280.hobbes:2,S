Subject: [PATCH[[2.5][9-11] correct the i2c address of the saa7111

Hello,
this patch corrects the i2c address from "34>>1" to 0x24 and 0x25. 
Believe me -- or look at the data sheet, for example from
http://www.gdv.uni-hannover.de/~hunold1/linux/saa7146/specs/saa7111a.pdf
Page 41 says: "Slave address read = 49H or 4BH; note 2 write = 48H or 4AH"
They use 8-bit addresses here, but i2c addresses are 7-bit, ie. 0x48>>1 
== 0x24 and 0x4a>>1 = 0x25
Please apply.
Thanks
Michael Hunold.
