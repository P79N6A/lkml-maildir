Assuming the late hour (hmm, early by now) hasn't crossed my
  eyes entirely the three above entities are %lu, %u, %u... so
  this line
printk("CPUFREQ DEBUG: [%lu] [%u] [%u]\n", l_p_j_ref, l_p_j_ref_freq, ci->new);
  as both first and last instruction in adjust_jiffies() turns
  up the same values, which are 1773568, 1, 0.
Side-note, since master penguin is looking... after the oops
  all SysRq stuff keeps working - except Alt-SysRq-B; the atkbd.c
  code tells me the keyboard says "too many keys pressed". K, T,
  P just do their job fine.
(yeah, okay, Alt-SysRq-O prints Power Off but obviously doesn't).
Thanks,
