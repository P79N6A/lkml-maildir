   why does net_dev.hard_start_xmit get called multiple times 
   with the same tcp packet?  
Because the ACK is not coming back for those packets within the RTO
(which for a local network is very low).  Check your TCP dumps,
the ACKs of the original data packets are being dropped in transit.
Franks a lot,
