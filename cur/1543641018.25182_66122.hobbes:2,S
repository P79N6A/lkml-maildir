nope - no other disk activity except the scp I used to
copy a file over the net.

I set the values as you suggested, but it made no difference:
joerg@laptop> scp othermachione:1gig_file /tmp
it take ~ 1/2 minute for 1 gig and gives a lot of errors
on the nic:
eth0      Protokoll:Ethernet  Hardware Adresse 00:07:CA:00:AC:A3  
          inet Adresse:10.0.0.30  Bcast:10.255.255.255  Maske:255.0.0.0

along with > 300 entries in /var/log/messages like this:
kernel: eth0: Too much work at interrupt, IntrStatus=0x0040
could anybody explain to me, why there is "Too much work at interrupt"?
and what I could do about it?
