Hi,
I'm porting a device driver from 2.0.x to 2.2.x. Since I'm a beginner in
kernel programming I'm learning as I go.
Right now I have to port a block of code that does a time delay. It uses
the variable (struct test_struct*) current->timeout, which is gone in
version 2.2.x. The implementation used is the same as that discussed in
Rubini's Linux Device Drivers book.
The code goes like this:
current->timeout = jiffies + tout;
interruptible_sleep_on(&wait);
Can anybody explain to me how to do the equivalent in 2.2.x? That is,
how to port code dependent on current->timeout to the new API.
Thanks.
