I sent a new patch in the same thread with this instead:
+#ifdef CONFIG_AVR32
+	port->flags |= UPF_IOREMAP;
+	port->membase = NULL;
+#else
This means that the console will be initialized a bit late, but I can
live with that for now. Maybe we can agree on a platform_data format so
that we can remove the #ifdef altogether?

Yeah, I'm struggling a bit with SPI right now, but I'll se if I can get
my AT91 board up and running after that.
I'll resend the first patch when the AVR32 patches are in, and the
last two after I've tested them on AT91.
