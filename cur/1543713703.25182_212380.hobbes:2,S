>> lack of interest in supporting notebook features
I'm glad that you're complaining about suspend/resume not working.
This means that you were able to boot and configure your system
using ACPI -- a year ago you wouldn't have got so far;-)
Yes, in the past year we've concentrated more on the configuration
issues at the expense of advanced features such as suspend/resume.
While we still have configuration issues, their frequency and
severity is lower than it once was, and so I'm hopeful that
we're over the hump there and will be able to
spend more time on features such as supsend/resume.
When I looked at a suspend/resume failure a couple of weeks ago
I discovered that there is no code in linux to save/restore
PCI configuration space for PCI bridges.  This is sort of a deal
killer -- as bits such as bus-master-enable could come up
enabled or disabled depending on the roll of the dice.
I hoped somebody on linux-pci would send a patch, but I haven't
seen one yet.
Cheers,
-Len
