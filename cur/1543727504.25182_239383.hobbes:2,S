Hi,
I received a mail this morning from mdadm to notify me of a RAID 
event. A partition, sda3, was kicked from a RAID5 array. Following 
error was logged in dmesg/syslog:
ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x1
ATA: abnormal status 0xD0 on port 0xD081B087
scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 02 05 d0 06 00 00 10 00
Current sda: sense key Medium Error
Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 33935366
ATA: abnormal status 0xD0 on port 0xD081B087
Aug  6 06:03:58 hibernia last message repeated 2 times
Can anyone shed light on the precise meaning and/or implications of 
above? Particularly the additional sense message, "auto reallocate 
failed" does this mean the drive is out of spare blocks?
Also, the drive is extremely slow now, about 1MB/s drive transfer 
rate as reported by hdparm -T.
regards,
