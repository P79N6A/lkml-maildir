According to both Digital Unix and Solaris, the correct [XPG4] argument
to [f]truncate is an off_t, and the correct return code is EINVAL if it
is less than zero.  The Linux documentation I have all give it as a
size_t but I guess that's just wrong, unless someone wants to directly
quote a standard saying it should be (when Digital Unix and Solaris
agree on the standards, typically that means they're right, or the
standards have changed since the releases I have installed).
(sometime I'll learn to stop looking at Linux manpages...they've led
me astray so many times.)
David.
