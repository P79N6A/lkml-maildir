Hello Adrian,
Last time when I had sent some BFS bugfixes to the maintainer of
this filesystem driver, he did not respond, and Andrew Morton
had to take care of those.
For this reason, and because the patches in this little patch bomb
are trivial, I am sending this to you in the hope that these can
be pushed upstream when the next merge window opens.
In case you'll be wondering why I need BFS: I teach system programming
and operating systems at the premises of the Moscow State University.
The BFS code is used as an example of a simple filesystem driver
implementation in Linux. This hopefully explains why I want to have
clean code in here :)
Some checkpatch.pl stats follow.

After:
----------------------------------------
|         | errors | warnings | checks |
----------------------------------------
| bfs.h   |   0    |    0     |   0    |
