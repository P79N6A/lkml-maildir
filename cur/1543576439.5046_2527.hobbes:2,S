This is a newbie question, but what are the recommended gcc compiler versions 
for compiling,
Linux 2.2.18?
Linux 2.4.0?
I'd rather use the recommended version than not and have difficult bugs.
Thanks.  If there is a FAQ, kindy direct me to it, or, if this info isn't in 
there specificly, perhaps a FAQ maintainer can add this stuff.
