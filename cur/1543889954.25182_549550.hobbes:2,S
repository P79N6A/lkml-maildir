I haven't had any problem booting with any of the kernels, but when I 
try to build a kernel with a Fedora config from /boot, it builds fine 
but doesn't boot after install. I started by building a very basic 
kernel for testing, and then started adding features to get everything I 
need. But just using the latest FC6 config file gets me a kernel which 
fails in just the way you mention.

Happy to say I don't see that, I'm using PATA optical devices, and USB 
on some machines, both work. I can't get scanning to work even after 
buying a "supported" scanner, so I may have to go back to Slackware and 
a 2.4 kernel on one machine, but boot and run does fine.
