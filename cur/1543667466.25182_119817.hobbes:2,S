Yes, please, do that :)
I did the hwif->mmio == 2 case especially for that purpose, that is
let the hwif driver deal with resource management since I need it
for ide-pmac.
(today, hwif->mmio == 0 means PIO, == 1 means MMIO with request_xxx
done by the generic code & other assumptions, and == 2 means the
generic code does nothing)
Paul: regarding media-bay, don't waste too much time on this for 2.5,
the whole probing stuff is going to change once I get the macio-asic
bus getting in and all those drivers moved to the new model.
The kernel still badly lacks some good way to deal with driver
dependencies (similar what I did with OCP stuff where a driver
can return -EAGAIN on probe when it relies on some other
not-yet-probed driver, but that's really a hack).
What I will do is that:
 - PCI layer will probe the macio-asic (based on matching the
OF node with whatever pmac_feature will have detected. I did consider
moving all of pmac_feature to macio-asic, but we still need too many
stuff beeing initialized early, so at least for 2.5, it will stay split)
 - macio-asic declares a bus type, and will probe devices based
on the OF tree. At this point, it will probe media-bays first
 - then it probes IDE drivers. Thus, the registration mecanism of
ide-pmac will be a carbon-copy of the one for IDE PCI devices.
In order to deal with ordering properly, media-bay will not call
ide_register_hw directly. Instead, it will call a pmac-ide specific
routine (either via macio-asic, that is it will force macio-asic
to add a new device to it's tree as by default, it will only be
one level deep, or I will go directly to ide-pmac, I haven't
decided yet).
At that point, ide-pmac can decide what to do, that is just reserve
the hwif slot for later probe, or really call ide_register_hw.
Ben.
