Hello developers,
I am currently writing a LSM security module. Because of how many functions 
work, I have to add CAP_SYS_ADMIN to the effective capabilities of the 
implemented "medium-privileged root" user. However, CAP_SYS_ADMIN is used in a 
_lot_ of places, so I need to add security_*() hooks for many functions that 
just return EPERM should current->euid be MediumPriv.
If you just look at include/linux/capabilities.h and look at the long list of 
what CAP_SYS_ADMIN enables, this might sound like an overkill. Is there a 
better way to do this?
