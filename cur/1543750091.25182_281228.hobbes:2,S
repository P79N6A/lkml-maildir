-/* #Specification: strategy / in memory inode
- * Here is the information specific to the inode of the UMSDOS file
- * system. This information is added to the end of the standard struct
- * inode. Each file system has its own extension to struct inode,
- * so do the umsdos file system.
- * 
- * The strategy is to have the umsdos_inode_info as a superset of
- * the msdos_inode_info, since most of the time the job is done
- * by the msdos fs code.
- * 
- * So we duplicate the msdos_inode_info, and add our own info at the
- * end.
- * 
- * The offset in this EMD file of the entry: pos
- * 
- * For directory, we have dir_locking_info to help synchronise
- * file creation and file lookup. See also msdos_fs_i.h for more 
- * information about msdos_inode_info.
- * 
- * Special file and fifo do have an inode which correspond to an
- * empty MSDOS file.
- * 
- * symlink are processed mostly like regular file. The content is the
- * link.
- * 
- * The UMSDOS specific extension is placed after the union.
