We have not established that at all. In principle, because SCHED_OTHER
tasks running at full priority lie on the boundary between SCHED_OTHER
and SCHED_FIFO, they can be made to run arbitrarily close to the
performance of tasks in SCHED_FIFO. With the upside that they won't be
able to deadlock the machine.
And I mean arbitrarily close in the strict delta-epsilon sense.
It's not perfect, but neither is SCHED_FIFO, in principle or in
practice.
