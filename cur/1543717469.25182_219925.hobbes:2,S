Looking at other card drivers, you'll find out what a driver look like.
You'll learn how a card driver interfaces to the kernel.
To write a driver for this card you _need_ to know how that particular
card is programmed. (What io adresses do it use, what do they mean,
what are the timing requirements, and so on.)
Looking at other drivers won't help you with that, unless one of the
other drivers happens to use the same chips. This information is in the
specs that broadcom so far haven't released.  Of course you can
write to broadcom, perhaps they'll inform you when they see you
are serious about this.
The card is not assigned an irq precicely because it has no driver.
IRQ's aren't handed out because devices exists - they are handed
out because device drivers request them from the kernel.
