I'll probably use debugfs.

OK.

Yes, indeed.

That's just my style I seem to also add to many single empty lines but I
don't have any problem with removing them.

Not really since it is only called from one place and there won't be any
size overhead (there might not be a big speed gain either). I wanted to
separate the deleting algorithm from the locking in memleak_free.

OK.

OK.

Indeed, I'll change it.

OK.

The best would be to test it using a loadable module but I did most of
the work on an embedded ARM platform where it was much easier to add
some code directly. The code will be cleaned up in subsequent versions.
Thanks again,
