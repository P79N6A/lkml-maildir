Look on the virtualization list may lkml was cc'd about getting
Xen and lguest.  "boot bzImages under paravirt"  I think was
the subject on one of the pieces.
A lot of this work is held up in part by the need to get 2.6.22
out, and in part because we have so much in flight work for the
early phases of boot that we need to let things settle
before it we can do more.
