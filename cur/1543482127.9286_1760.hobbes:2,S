    Hopefully nobody is still saying this.  In the old days, when
    processors were slow and DMA didn't exist, copies were bad,
    but I don't think that any systems built in the last decade
    suffer from this disadvantage.
    People were still saying this when I worked for the idiots at Sybase
    about a decade ago, and they (we) kept putting our feet in it when
    our victims would try that out, only to realize that scribbling on
    a filesystem was considerablty faster (if somewhat less reliable)
    than scribbling on raw partitions.
