We _want_ to be able to read mmio ranges via /dev/mem, don't we?  I guess
it has never come up because everyone uses kmem.

nah ;)

An access to an illegal address should generate a fault, period.  This puts
the processing into the hands of software.  If software chooses to silently
ignore the fault (ie: "silent data corruption") then it is poorly designed.
If the hardware doesn't give the system programmer a choice then the
hardware is poorly designed, surely?
