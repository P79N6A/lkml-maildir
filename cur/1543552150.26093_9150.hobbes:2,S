While the poster was obviously being an irrational jerk, his opnion wasn't
totally inapporiately placed on this list. By getting people kicked off of
systems because they have strong (and potentially stupid) ideas is not a
good thing. Fear can be a more effective restraint on open discussion then
laws.
Any developer thick-skinned enough to with the strong personalities on this
list should have now problem ignoring the poster's inarticulate and childish
complaints.
