Your example is wrong, it's:
               void function(int a, int b,
                             int c, int d, int e)
This is the most common convention in the kernel - and except for 
extremely long function names it's the one with the best readability.
Yes, it's a problem with extremely long function names, but they are 
rare in the kernel.
And the "varying amounts of spaces" should be handled automatically by 
your editor.
