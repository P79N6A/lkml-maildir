I suppose it's a matter of taste, but at least personally I believe that
userspace exposed ABI's shouldn't be configurable as a starting point
(if the code delta is 100's of kilobytes it's a different topic); what
point is talking about a stable ABI if it's there or not half the
time... that's the ultimate instability.
