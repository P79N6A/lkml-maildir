This is the first 2.2.x I've built since pre13. Am I the
only one who got a surprise when depmod -a took 20 minutes
to run? There was a big spill of 'not an ELF archive'
messages, but I got a nice dependency tree for all the
kernel object files.
Too bad it confuses modprobe so. I suppose there's a
modules.conf trick to exclude [build].
