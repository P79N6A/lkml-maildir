The cifs user guide (note that smbfs did not have a user's guide) does
list the required mount options pretty clearly in the section on mount
syntax on page 4.   Excerpt follows:
mounting to older servers (those prior to1997) may require specifying
two additional fields beyond
those which smbfs required:
a) The server's netbios (RFC1001) name AND the server's tcp (or ip )
address. CIFS does not
assume, as smbfs did, that the tcp name and the netbios name of the
server are the same. The netbios name of the server is specified by
passing the mount option "servern=SERVERNAME" and is not assumed to be
necessarily the same as the tcp name of the server (also note that the
netbios name is usually capitalized). Both tcp/ip name and netbios
name have to be specified for mounts for most old lanman servers. For
example:
         mount -t cifs //tcp-name-of-server/sharename
Current versions of "mount.cifs -h" also list all mount options, and
the README information on the syntax is also current and contains
information which needs to be added to the mount.cifs man page.   I
will make this fix for the mount.cifs man page, it lags behind the
mount.cifs help and the README but any additional updates to the man
page text to clarify it would be welcome.
