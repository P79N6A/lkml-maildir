I understand. My intent was different, however. One of the bigger sticking
points for usb-serial was its interaction with line disciplines, which are
notorious for looping back and requesting writes from callbacks
(e.g. h_hdlc.c). They are also sensitive to drivers lying about the
amount of free space in their FIFOs. This is something you never test
when driving a serial port from an application, no matter how cleverly
written.
