Its a non trivial trade-off. 4/4 lets you run very large physical memory
systems much more efficiently than usual but you pay a cost on syscalls
and some other events when using the majority of processors. The 4/4
tricks also give most emulations (eg Qemu) serious heartburn trying to
emulate %cr3 reloading via mmap and other interfaces with high overhead
in relative terms.
Of course AMD64 kind of shot the problem in the head once and for all.
