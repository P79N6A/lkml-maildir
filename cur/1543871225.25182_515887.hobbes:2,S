I found http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xen-devel&m=117309332600075&w=2 and
that must be the one you meant.  The ELF-grokking form of that is exactly
what I had in mind.  The "find relocs with cmp" scheme is pretty silly, but
also works fine.  It trades tweaky ELF knowledge with tweaky fragile build
methods, but it's all about the same to me.  
Thanks,
Roland
