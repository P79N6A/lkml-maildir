The expected build failure is obvious from reading the code:
 #ifdef CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS
 void early_init_irq_lock_class(void)
 {
 #ifndef CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ
         struct irq_desc *desc;
         int i;
         for_each_irq_desc(i, desc) {
                 if (!desc)
                         continue;
                 lockdep_set_class(&desc->lock, &irq_desc_lock_class);
Note that it's an #ifndef sparseirq, not an #ifdef sparseirq condition.
