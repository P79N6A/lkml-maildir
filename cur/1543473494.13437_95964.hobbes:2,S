The paragraph that reads:
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
which is the one that we are talking about, is not part of the GPL.
You'll notice it is found in an *appendix* of the file `COPYING'.  It
is suggested text that you can use to apply the terms of the GPL to
your code.  You're free to modify it, or to use other text.
A good example is from the text that comes with perl:
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of either:
        a) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
        Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any
        later version, or
        b) the "Artistic License" [...]
Nothing stops you from saying:
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation.
