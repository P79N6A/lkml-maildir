in my experience, the only chance you have is doing API changes as first in the set of changes,
and then hoping (making) all other trees use the new APIs. Any other order just turns into
an impossible mismash.
I can see the point of doing an LKML annouce of the new API after the series is done, so that 
all other maintainers have a chance to fix their trees (this of course is only for new occurances
of the old api showing up; the api change series should convert all existing users)
