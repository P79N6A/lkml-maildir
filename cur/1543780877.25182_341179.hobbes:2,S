HP, Sun & friends seem to use AMD chipsets (AMD64 has a serious lack of 
support from "serious" chipset makers - many people do argue
that the nvidias are far from being "good" chipsets) and they seem to
support linux, but it's not easy to find motherboards for amd64 cpus
with amd chipsets on them. Good chipsets seems to be one of
the reasons why some people keeps buying intel...
