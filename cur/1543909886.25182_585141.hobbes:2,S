even simpler : I've never been aware of linux-kernel-announce. It's
possible that only Linus sends there and that even the -stable team
does not use/know about it either.

we all have somewhat different scripts. Those scripts do 80% of the work
depending on our environments, mostly in order to avoid common mistakes,
and we do the remaining 20% by hand. Anyway I think it's not difficult
for any of us to add a new address.
(CCing -stable and Adrian in case they miss your mail)
