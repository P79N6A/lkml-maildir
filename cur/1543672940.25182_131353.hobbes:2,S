Subject: removing a single device?

A long time ago I used to be able to do:
echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 11 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 11 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
When I wanted to unplug a SCA scsi drive for replacement.  I tried this
recently on my 2.4.20 kernel and nothing happened.  No errors, no change
to /proc/scsi/scsi, no entry in dmsg, it just ignored it.  Has this been
deprecated for a new way of removing hotswap drives?
Thanks,
  Robert
