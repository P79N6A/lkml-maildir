Sami,
    I don't believe that additional change to initscripts could be
the cause because Fedora Core 2 doesn't support udev. Only Fedora
Core 3 implements that feature and there are reports of the same
problem occuring under it with 6.5.10.

I did notice that FC3 seems to be using initscripts-7.93.5 which
still uses hotplug instead of udevsend. However it seems odd that
both forms (dev and udev) seemed to have gotten broken in the same
way. I assume one can't use udevsend if the kernel isn't using udev
right?
