Current ext3 CVS (ie: 2.4.20 candidate code) is using b_inode
as an inode *.   Stephen has acked a proposal to stop doing that,
but let's double check with him first.
Also, Joe Thornber needs to add another pointer to struct buffer_head
for LVM2 reasons.  If we collapse b_inode into a b_flags bit then
Joe gets his pointer for free (bh stays at 48 bytes on ia32).
So I'd suggest you just go ahead and do it that way.  (I had a patch
for that but seem to have misplaced it).
