No, I don't necessarily need inode numbers. So your suggestion
would work. The critical case however is the unregister operation,
where I need to do something close to a revoke operation, and therefore
I need to iterate over all file descriptors that have the file open. The
way I read
your code, it's not possible currently with devfs.
Because my requirements seem quite special, I'm not very convinced
that it does make sense to make devfs more complicated, usbdevfs
is a rather self contained thing right now.
