Evgeniy, you may want to learn something about the VM before
stating that reality should not occur.
Due to the way everything in the kernel works, you cannot
prevent the memory allocator from allocating everything and
running out, except maybe by setting aside reserves to deal
with special subsystems.
As for your "swapping early and reduce memory usage", that is
just not possible in a system where a memory writeout may need
one or more memory allocations to succeed and other I/O paths
(eg. file writes) can take memory from the same pools.
With something like iscsi it may be _necessary_ for file writes
and swap to take memory from the same pools, because they can
share the same block device.
Please get out of your fantasy world and accept the constraints
the VM has to operate under.  Maybe then you and Peter can agree
on something.
