We need both with CONFIG_EMBEDDED depending on CONFIG_ADVANCED (see my 
other email).

It is not a maintenence load, but does it make sense to offer this in 
any way to _users_?
gcc already sets this options with -Os/-O2.
We do already override the choice of gcc in some cpu specific cases.
If someone is doing performance comparisons and discovers that the 
default settings gcc chooses aren't good, the only sane thing is to 
discuss whether it makes sense to change this.
