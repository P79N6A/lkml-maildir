Ran for a bit over 10 mins outside of X to avoid other tasks influencing 
results. I was too lazy to go to init 1.

mean 68.7 seconds
range 63-73 seconds.
For a load that wakes up so frequently for such a short period of time I think 
that is pretty fair cpu distribution over 10 mins. Over shorter periods top 
is hopeless at representing accurate cpu usage, especially at low HZ settings 
of the kernel. You can see the current cpu distribution on ps there is pretty 
consistent across the tasks and gives what I consider quite a fair cpu 
distribution over 10 mins.
