Hi Florian,
Yes, currently it is a platform driver. Here is my platform data:
static struct fpgaload_pdata_t fpgaload_pdata = {
        .fpga_family            = FPGA_FAMILY_XILINX_XC3S,
        .payload_full_size      = XC3S1400A_PAYLOAD_SIZE,
        .program_b              = GPIO(21),
        .done                   = GPIO(19),
        .init_b                 = GPIO(20),
        .swapbits               = 0,
        .interface              = FPGALOAD_INTERFACE_SERIAL,
        .bitstream_name         = "fpga.bit",
};

This is already the case with request_firmware :) The bitstream_name field in platform data is used to specify the name of the file.

This is pretty much like that right now, exceptfor sysfs attributes.

Yes, I think this could work, but I would like to know what kind of driver fpgaload-core would be. Currently it is a platform driver and a chardev (to support open and write methods for programming). How shall I implement it? Bus driver, platform driver?
Ciao, Hugo V.
