Same here. Though, I somewhat imposed it on the managers.

This is not quite correct since it needs a proper kernel interface
to construct a useful user space solution. Werner, IMHO, correctly
pointed out that the FANCY solution stuff and the configurable
parts should go to user space. The kernel itself should provide
a reasonable default action which is stateless, simple, fast and small.
I think we all agree that the kernel has to take proper measures
to keep the most important processes running.

That is the point. IF you are doing the most complicated and
memory-intensive simulations then you want to GUARANTEE that this one
does not die after five days of computing time.

Yes, and my simulation if ever possible. And if the simulation is the
problem, I probably would prefer to stop the process, decide to add some
more swap space if I have some free hard disk space and continue the process.

To summarize my opinion:
We need proper kernel handling of OOM situations it should be simple,
stateless, and failsafe.
In addition we should have a nice interface (device, proc, ...) 
which makes it possible to construct a user space solution of
NEAR OOM situations which is configurable (fancy and shining :) if
necessary) to make it suitable for (almost) all needs out there.
