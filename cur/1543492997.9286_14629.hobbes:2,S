This machine had two drives, one on each IDE controller.  hda had DMA on
after booting; on hdc, DMA was off, although I was able to turn it on once
with no apparent ill effects.  (It was off at the time of the crash.)
A couple of days ago, I got these kernel messages:

At which point, I immediately shut down and replaced the drive, which was
getting too small anyway.  It was two years old, and had been running 24/7,
so I guess this supports both the hardware failure theory and this DMA bug
theory.
Some information on the dearly departed disk:
Apr 13 13:48:13 dreish kernel: hda: WDC AC22500L, ATA DISK drive
Apr 13 13:48:13 dreish kernel: ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Apr 13 13:48:13 dreish kernel: hda: WDC AC22500L, 2441MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=620/128/63, DMA
And I don't know how useful this is, but here's what /proc provides about
the controller, ide0:
