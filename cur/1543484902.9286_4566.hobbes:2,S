You haven't looked at the code in fs/isofs, have you? The Joliet code
only gets linked directly into your kernel if the ISO9660 code does.
CONFIG_JOLIET changes the way the isofs code works; it'd probably be a 
pain to make it compile to a separate module loaded by isofs.o.
Also, I don't really see why making it work that way would be
worthwhile -- the extra code involved in CONFIG_JOLIET amounts to
about 1.5K of object code on my i686 box.
