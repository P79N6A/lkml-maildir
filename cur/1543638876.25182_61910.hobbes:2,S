I'm afraid even that didn't help much - Only now I get a different kind of error... Before, trying to play a sound, the operation would just fisish immediatelyand a few noises were heard in the speakers... Now the operation never finishes - still no sound... and I found these error messages in dmesg..
dmesg:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 11:44:41 Aug  6 2002
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 00:1f.5 to 64

i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5362 (Unknown)
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total channels = 2
i810_audio: drain_dac, dma timeout?
Any more suggestions?
