Well Chuck, I have just tried using the same cd again and yes it is
reproducable.
As soon as I get one of these :
Aug 10 18:16:26 tt2 kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Aug 10 18:16:26 tt2 kernel: 0b:00, want=532574, limit=532572 
klogd starts using 100% CPU.
So it looks like the race condition is in the cdrom layer.
Anything else I can do to try find this bug, I will be happy to do.
Cheers Mof.
