I'm tempted to use raiserfs on a 45gig raid partition because I don't
want to grow old and die before it finishes fscking. The main hassle
is that that partition will be NFSed out and in the past there have
been mutterings of rfs hacing hassles with nfs. Have these been sorted?
Is there anything else I'd need to know about? A journalled fs would
be way nice to have and I need to make a decision between ext2 and rfs
asap.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
