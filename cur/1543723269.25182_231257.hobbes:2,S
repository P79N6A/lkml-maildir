Just got this from 2.6.7 + BK as of 20040629.
irq 11: nobody cared!
Stack pointer is garbage, not printing trace
handlers:
[<e09960b0>] (usb_hcd_irq+0x0/0x60 [usbcore])
[<c02684b0>] (e100_intr+0x0/0x110)
Disabling IRQ #11
First boot of the same kernel ran fine for a day, then USB mouse hung
(replug cured it). Then on next reboot it disabled irq 11 and e100 and
one usb port along with it (mouse is in another usb port and worked
fine). I rebooted it again and now it's working fine again.
I looked into the logs of the first accident and it's mostly the same (a
couple of X restarts to check whether it revives the mouse):
