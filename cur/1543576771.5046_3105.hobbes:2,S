The PCMCIA thing is unlikely to be related (there are no changes on any PCMCIA
that actually worked on 13pre4). Reiserfs might be the trigger because the
quota code changed, but if it did touch it I'd expect it to have failed
to compile

I'm going to go and do a detailed audit of the mm bits I have differing from
Linus. For one I'd be much happier to differ in drivers with Linus and avoid
differing in mm/vm internals stuff.
