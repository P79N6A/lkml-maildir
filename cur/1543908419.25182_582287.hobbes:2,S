Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
this includes a regression fix and two minor fixes. The regression was 
noticed today by Arjan on the F8-Test1 kernel (which uses .23-rc2): if 
his laptop boots from battery then cpu_khz gets mis-detected and 
subsequently sched_clock() runs too fast - causing interactivity 
problems. This was a pre-existing sched_clock() regression and those 
sched_clock() problems are being addressed by Andi's cpufreq sched-clock 
patchset, but meanwhile i've fixed the regression by making the 
rq->clock logic more robust against such type of sched_clock() 
anomalies. (it was already robust against time warps) Arjan tested the 
fix and it solved the problem. There's also a small 
kernel-address-information-leak fix for the SCHED_DEBUG case noticed by 
Arjan and a fix for a SCHED_GROUP_FAIR branch (not enabled upstream, but 
still working if enabled manually).
