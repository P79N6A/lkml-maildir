No, I don't. I did not receive any feedback since I sent in the patch
to linux-kernel, so I concluded that people do not consider lack
of shortcut/symlink support a problem. For me it's something that
would be nice to have but I don't feel like pushing it in.
I might be able to upgrade the patch for the 2.5 kernal line, but
I'd like to hear some comments about the code in general. 
Yours,
