I really hate to be a killjoy to one who is so enthusiastic, but to be 
perfectly blunt,
* I doubt you will get much help.  From GGI to today, the world has been 
full of people who have a clear picture of where Linux graphics needs to 
be... and they never got very far.  So if you don't already have a clear 
picture, you have ever farther to go.
* You really need to already know a good deal about graphics hardware, 
old and new, before starting down this path.
* Review Dave Airlie's posts, he's been pretty spot-on in this thread. 
There needs to be a lowlevel driver that handles PCI functionality, and 
registers itself with the fbdev and DRM layers.  The fbdev/DRM 
registrations need to be aware of each other.  Once that is done, work 
will proceed more rapidly.
And mind you, _I_ am saying all this as one of the crowd who wants to 
rewrite Linux video... once I get a free year or two.  I got my start in 
kernel graphics (fbdev) ~ a decade ago, and I've followed the graphics 
world intensely even since.  However, the more realistic people will 
just re-read DaveA's posts.
The path you suggest -- a third graphics system -- is going to be 
completely ignored by everyone unless/until its so wonderful that we 
just _have_ to switch.  And given past history (GGI, ...) it will be a 
lonely path for a long time.
