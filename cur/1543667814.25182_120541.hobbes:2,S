Fionn,
I had similar problems, and reported them on this list on 12/04/2002 . 
The reason is the amd76x_pm module which leads to the TSCs of the CPUs 
to become unsyncronized.
One way around this is to disable TSC altogether; this in my case 
required installing a glibc compiled for i386 (instead of i686) which 
slows some things down, and to use the 'notsc' boot option.
However, programs that use rdtsc (in my case Intels Fortran Compiler, 
ifc) then fail. As I develop programs using ifc, I therefore have not 
been able to use amd76x_pm - I wish there were a better solution, and 
wonder why this is not a problem with e.g. dual-processor Xeons.
