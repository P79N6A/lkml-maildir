Ditto.
It is really bad to have an OOPS that can be generated by simply
removing a device at the usb port. This can open a door for DoS attacks.
IMO, this kind of bug should be fixed as soon as possible. 
If you take a look at the history of this bug, it were reported back on
Jan, 14. Also, Adrian sent several regression reports c/c to
v4l-dvb-mailing list (so copying all V4L/DVB maintainers, including you,
me, Markus and the others), warning about the bug, and pointing that a
patch from Markus were already available.
I also explicitly warned at DVB ML that I were about to send this patch,
together with other fixes, asking the community for more tests. After
that, I received two positive answers on my mailbox from people that
tested and noticed that this really fixed the issue.
I don't think that 3 months is a short period of time for us to work on
a solution for the bug and have it done to be included on Kernel.
Cheers,
Mauro
