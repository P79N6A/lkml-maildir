I've had the same problem (tried with 2.6.25-rc3, -rc5 and -rc6). 
Got a MacBook Pro 2,2 (first Core 2 Duo series) here.

I've solved some issues, using "init=/bin/sh" in the kernel commandline.
You can then call "/usr/sbin/pm-suspend" and system will actually output
messages while suspending - does not happen with normal Ubuntu init.
The first issue I got was the "hangs after Suspending console(s)"
Solution: kernel command line += "no_console_suspend"
The 2nd one is a problem with /dev/hda (CDROM) error "drive not ready". 
I could kind of solve this by not using the piix driver from the
"ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL" section anymore. I only use ata_piix driver from the
Serial ATA section now, which seems to support the CD drive to.
Well, after that my system goes into suspend. yay!, but when it wakes 
up. I get the following sequenze:
- Fan starts running
- Sound klicks softly
- CD drive makes a short noise
- CD drive makes the same noise again (moving the laser i guess)
- EFI Bootloader appears
(the second CD drive noise is already part of boot sequence - 
I am not sure about the first one though)
Anyway, I am not sure if it's nessesary, but I also disabled:
 - dynamic tics
 - smp
 - forced preemption
 - modular USB and SATA drivers
I still suspect the CD drive to be a problem. - searching for a way to
disable it for now.
Greetings from Berlin
