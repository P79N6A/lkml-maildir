There's no overkill at all, the current uses are already accessed with 
these bitshifts so there's no overhead when using an inlined function 
instead.
To correctly access the pss, these bitshifts are required because the 
decision was made to use the lower PSS_DIV_BITS for rounding.  Thus, you 
need to include accessor functions so that they are always accessed 
correctly now and in the future.
