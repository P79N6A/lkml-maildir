Don't you mean they are remembering all the inode numbers of the
directories _above_ the one they are currently working on?  I'm quite
sure they aren't remembering all the directories they have processed.

Yes, I didn't think of that.

No, it's usually working with a _single_ file at a time.  It will
remember inode numbers of files with nlink > 1, but it won't remember
all the other inode numbers.
You could have a filesystem with 4billion files, each one having two
links.  Not a likely scenario though.
