>yep, i already tried to check how well it integrates to x86.git:
I ported it to scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm.
I will send out the patch and then look at the below discussion.

>discussion between Roland McGrath and Alan Stern on lkml, about kwatch 
>-> hw_breakpoint, to see how a more general debugging framework 
>can/should be built. These things shouldnt be limited to user-space 
>alone, the kernel could probably use hardware tracing even more than 
>user-space could. (because it's a much harder to debug environment)
