well.
or we declare the irq probing stuff "rare" and just make THAT fully
serializing....
do a full synchronization before starting a probe 
(at that point no new async stuff can show up if it wouldn't show up
already right now), and be done with it.

too bad this stuff isn't PCI enumerated.
but if someone really still maintains this code, it could probably be
rewritten in a "we think it's likely irq 3. how about we test that. Oh
no? then we do expensive probing" kind of way.
Right now I don't think I have time for it (this is going to take time..
there's so many weird things with serial ports that it's bound to break
stuff in the beginning etc)
