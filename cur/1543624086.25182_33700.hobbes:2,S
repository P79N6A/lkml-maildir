    I have updated the patch a bit and resycned to 2.5.6.  Are you
    interested?  I believe a user interface for setting task CPU

    A syscall implementation seems to be what everyone wants (I have a
    proc-interface, too...)
Can't wer just copy the IRIX interface here as some other pathces have
in the past?
