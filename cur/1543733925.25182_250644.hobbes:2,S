The only motive I'm aware of is for latency in the presence of things
such as autofs. It's also worth noting that in the presence of things
such as removable media umount is also much more common. I personally
find this sufficiently compelling. Kirill may have additional ammunition.
Also, the additional sizeof(struct list_head) is only a requirement
while the global inode LRU is maintained. I believed it would have
been beneficial to have localized the LRU to the sb also, which would
have maintained sizeof(struct inode0 at parity with current mainline.
