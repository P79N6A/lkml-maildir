There are a number of fixes pending for 2.4, and released for 2.2, but
nothing that would explain the sort of kernel corruption you are
reporting --- it sounds as if you are overrunning the end of the
kiobuf, but it's hard to know without seeing the real code.

Careful, you can't touch the buffer for a WRITE map.  The READ/WRITE
flag is from the point of view of the user, and user write() syscalls
don't touch the data in memory!  If you want to modify the user
buffer, you need to use READ instead.
Cheers,
 Stephen
