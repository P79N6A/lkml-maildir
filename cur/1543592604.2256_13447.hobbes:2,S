Sounds like IO starvation, if your reading from one partition to the
other, it's going to suck for IO --- the head will be going nuts.
Also, 2.2.x has a single IO queue for writes (doesn't it?), so that won't
help.
What if you dd a file from one partition to another, is the problem
lesser with larger buffers, say 64M or so?
What about dd from /dev/zero to a partition, so you get heavy writes,
does this also suck?
