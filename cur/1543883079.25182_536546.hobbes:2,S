At least one way to handle BUG_ON() type situations more cleanly (for
some anyway) is to fake a hot-unplug/plug event. Thats something that
would be nice to get into the PCI code as it'll let you recover from many
things (even in some cases hardware fails if you go via D3). Does need
some supporting logic (eg for networking to get back with the same config
and online)
