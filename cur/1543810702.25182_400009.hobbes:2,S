Yes, I tend to think that insmod should just block until all devices are
ready to be used.  insmod doesn't just "insert a module".  It runs that
module's init function.
The very common case is that userspace wants to use those devices
immediately upon return from insmod, and the handling of these
not-yet-ready devices from userspace is very hard - generally people just
stick lame sleeps in there to get around it.
If, for some strange and rare reason, people _really_ want the
return-when-its-not-ready-yet behaviour, they can do `insmod foo &', or we
give insmod a fork-then-exit option.
But right now the default (and unalterable) behaviour is the oddball,
rarely-desired and hard-to-handle one.
