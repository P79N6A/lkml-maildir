Because:
last_addr = phys_addr + size - 1
means that
size = last_addr - phys_addr + 1
not
size = last_addr - phys_addr
If you leave out this change, then a request for a page-aligned 4096+1
bytes will give you a single 4096 byte page, and the kernel will crash
when you access byte 4096+1.
As this bug has been in the kernel for years, it apparently isn't common
to access 4097-byte item starting on page boundaries;-)
However, ACPI maps tables that are left on arbitrary byte boundaries by
the BIOS.  In this case we got a table that started near the end of a
page and overflowed 1 byte into the next page -- which has the same
effect as the simpler case above.
cheers,

ps. this fix has been in 2.6 for several months -- sort of a bummer it
had to be debugged and fixed twice.
