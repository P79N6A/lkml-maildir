Matt Mackall would know better than I.  He's the person
CELF hired to do this.  Here are some of the previous LKML
discussions around this issue:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/11/115
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/31/208
Last time I talked to Matt about this (some time in
November, I believe), he said he had worked out a
solution agreeable to H. Peter Anvin, who had issues
with the original submission.  I'm not sure if that
latest solution was submitted to mainline or not.
Matt?
