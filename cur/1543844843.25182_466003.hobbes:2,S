I've looked hard at things and just found that maybe it's not the init
order that's to blame..
It seems that unmounting the filesystem fails with a "device busy" error.
I'm not sure why there's still open files on the device, but perhaps a
remote user is copying a file or some such (likely).
Anyway, the system is shutting down, so it should just forcefully
unmount the device, but it doesn't.
The halt script tries "umount" three times, which all fail with:
"device is busy".
It then actually tries "umount -f" three times, which all fail with
"Device or resource busy"
At which point the halt script turns off the machine and the
filesystem is ruined.
How to fix forceful unmount so it works?
