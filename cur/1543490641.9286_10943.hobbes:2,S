i've tested this patch under the same environment as i developed my own,
and this patch appears to correct the problem as well as mine.  buffer
cache grows to about 93M then stays fixed there.  block reads remain at a
low rate during the benchmark, and the CPU is fully utilized.
i've also been running with it on my laptop all weekend, and it appears
stable across a variety of applications including ApplixWare, Navigator,
kernel builds, mpg123 (of course!), and benchmark runs.

looks OK to me.
