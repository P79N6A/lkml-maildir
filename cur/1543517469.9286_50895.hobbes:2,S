The only thing you may need is to synchronize the tasks sharing the memory
if you risk to race. Just choose your preferred way. You can use a
spinlock allocated in the shm segment, you can use ipc semaphores or ipc
messages too I think. Or if your operations on shm can scale in SMP just
use mb() to enforce ordering and write SMP aware algorithms without
spinlocks at all.

On x86 the only thing you may need is a lock on the bus to avoid
speculative reads.

If it's simple for you to use a spinlock in the kernel you are fine as you
can/must use it also in userspace.

A context-switch doesn't invalidate the cache, it only flushes the TLB and
it can't be your problem. I guess the 100Hz is just a delay long enough to
trigger some cache timeout.

Are you sure it's not gcc that optimized away the reads from memory? GCC
always think the program is single threaded and if ptr was zero it will
remains zero because nobody other than you is sharing the var and you are
not touching it, so you should make sure to declare it volatile if the
GCC default assumntion are not correct (as in your case).

This sound very suspect to me. Of course I don't know the details about
the hardware you are using.
Anyway to invalidate the cache what you need is a wbinvd. I don't remeber
if it can be run from userspace (I guess no at least without iopl). Check
the specs for that.
