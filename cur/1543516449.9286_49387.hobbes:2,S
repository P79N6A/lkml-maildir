Heh, found this in an old mailfolder I don't read anymore..

Which means strace would need to turn fork into a clone call iff
we're running on Linux and iff we have a recent enough kernel, right?
That would mean adding more conditions to the code where it's already
messy enough.. although it would make it easier to port (right now
it goes wrong for mipsel for example, I think it still uses i386-instruction
on a mips processor.. oops!).
