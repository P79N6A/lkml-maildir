pcihpd-discuss?  Don't you mean the linux-pci mailing list instead?
A few initial comments on your patch:
 - Is there any way to dynamically detect if hardware can support MSI?
 - If you enable this option, will boxes that do not support it stop
   working?
A driver has to be modified to use this option, right?  Do you have any
drivers that have been modified?  Without that, I don't think we can
test this patch out, right?

You are cluttering up this file with a lot of #ifdefs.  Is there any way
you can not do this?
Does this break the summit and/or NUMA builds?

Will this _always_ be the value?  Can boxes have bigger numbers (I
haven't seen the spec, so I don't know...)
Care to add a comment about this value?

Put the EXPORT_SYMBOL in the files that have the functions.  Don't
clutter up the ksyms.c files anymore.

Shouldn't this be static?

Same with this one?

Don't do direct writes to memory, use the proper function calls.  You do
this in a few other places too.
That's enough to get the conversation started :)
