Benchmark them - original and your revised.   (Their equivalents, that is,
in userspace with rdtscll() ) 
Put them into a test-harness calling them million times (or some such).
Look also what assembly the compiler produced, e.g. that it didn't optimize
away error paths.

That is common fallacy.  Learn to code in environments where you
have to account for every byte of code and ram usage, and your code
will be fast even in bigger systems.
