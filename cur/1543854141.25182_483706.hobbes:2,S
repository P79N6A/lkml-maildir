I would never call *power cycle* stupid, just because from physics
point of veiw.
Example. I have my flower.upol.cz many kilometers far away from me.
I used to boot it from that flash (new hardware, sata problems, etc).
When something goes wrong with rc kernel or power source, bum.
And i had to move my ass there, just to press reset. Because.
While i have "power on, on AC failures" in BIOS, *sometimes* flash
will not boot (i don't know why, maybe it's GRUB+flash-read,
or BIOS usb hdd implementation specific).
DTR laptop ~33% doesn't boot that flash. And laptop has no reset button.
Operator is present, so your consern is right here.
