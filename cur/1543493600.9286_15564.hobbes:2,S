Make sure you include the linux headers from the new version of the
kernel you just built.  Either ensure that the /usr/include/linux
symlink resolves to that kernel tree or compile with the
"-I<new-linux-tree-directory>/include" compiler flag/

Because the _syscall* macros need to know how many arguments to pass to
the CPU mechanism used to invoke the system call.

Just use "_syscall2", "_syscall1" or some other syscall* different from
"_syscall3".
