> 2.2.18pre15
I'd like to know if there are any issues with the current dc390-2.0e or
2.0e3 drivers that prevent its inclusion/that prevent Kurt from
submitting it for inclusion. As per the web page, 2.0e was supposed to
be sent to Linux for 2.4, so it should not have been too bad ;)
AFAICS, the xmas-1998-release, 2.0d, is still in 2.2.18pre15, and
I was under the impression it was reported to be incompatible with some
SCSI scanners, until 2.0d18. 
(Of course, it might be useful to additionally blacklist non-compliant
devices publicly so manufacturers have a motivation to fix their
things).
