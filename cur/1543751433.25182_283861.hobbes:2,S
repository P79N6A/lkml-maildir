IIRC that guarantees a deadlock on SMP due to the
generic serial layer trying to grab a spinlock
that is already held. (Which prompted the original
bug report by Tim several months ago)
Perhaps the FIFO trigger threshold for this
specific device can be altered
to try and smooth the amount of data dumped
per IRQ.
