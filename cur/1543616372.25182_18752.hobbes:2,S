Ben,
By any chance do you have a list of drivers that assume this ? 
What does it take to fix them ? 
I think Jens BIO changes for 2.5 will fix this problem. But 
2.4 needs a solution in this area too. This patch showed 
significant improvement for database workloads. 
If it is not reasonable to fix all the brokern drivers,
how about making this configurable (to do variable size IO) ?
Do you favour this solution ?
Regards,
Badari
