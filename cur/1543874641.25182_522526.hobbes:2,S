Sorry, I can't understand you. lockdep_depth is counted within a process,
which starts before f(), yes. This process is cwq->thread, it was forked
during create_workqueue(). It does not take any locks directly, only by
calling work->func(). laundry_wq doesn't differ from keventd_wq or any other
wq in this sense. nfsd does not "runs kthread by itself", it inserts the
work and wakes up cwq->thread.

This means we have a problem with leak detection.

I didn't mean this patch makes things worse (except it conflicts with other
patches in -mm tree). In fact, it may improve the diagnostics. My point is
that this patch afaics has nothing to do with the discussed problem.
