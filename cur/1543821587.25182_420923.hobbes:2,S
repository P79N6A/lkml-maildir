Userspace can make your life hell by depending on indentation via 4
spaces.  The problem is that you don't necessarily know that it does
until you managed to change indentation.
In a filesystem tree, it is fairly hard to make assumptions that are
later broken.  It is by no means impossible, agreed.  But the
"indentation" doesn't exist anymore.  A file is part of a subdirectory
or it isn't.  Opening tags without matching closing tags don't exist
either.  List goes on.
In the end, both formats can get abused in ways you'd never foresee.
But the directory tree considerably raises the barrier.
