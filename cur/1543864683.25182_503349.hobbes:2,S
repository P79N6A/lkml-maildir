Subject: [PATCH 2 of 4] Introduce i386 fibril scheduling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/30/329

This patch introduces the notion of a 'fibril'.  It's meant to be a lighter
kernel thread.  There can be multiple of them in the process of executing for a
given task_struct, but only one can every be actively running at a time.  Think
of it as a stack and some metadata for scheduling them inside the task_stuct.
This implementation is wildly architecture-specific but isn't put in the right
places.  Since these are not code paths that I have extensive experience with,
I focused more on on getting it going and representative of the concept than on
making it right on the first try.  I'm actively interested in feedback from
people who know more about the places this touches.
The fibril struct itself is left stand-alone for clarity.  There is a 1:1
relationship between fibrils and struct thread_info, though, so it might make
more sense to embed the two somehow.
The use of list_head for the run queue is simplistic.  As long as we're not
removing specific fibrils from the list, which seems unlikely, we be more
clever.  Maybe no more clever than a singly-linked list, though.
Fibril management is under the runqueue lock because that ends up working well
for the wake-up path as well.  In the current patch, though, it makes for some
pretty sloppy code for unlocking the runqueue lock (and re-enabling interrupts
and pre-emption) on the other side of the switch.
The actual mechanics of switching from one stack to another at the end of
schedule_fibril() makes me nervous.  I'm not convinced that blindly copying the
contents of thread_info from the previous to the next stack is safe, even if
done with interrupts disabled.  (NMIs?)  The juggling of current->thread_info
might be racy, etc.
