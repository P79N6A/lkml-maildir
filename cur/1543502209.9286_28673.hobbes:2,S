Hi,

ext2 now gets this wrong: the 64-bit file code broke the bounds checking
on 32-bit architectures, so we overflowed the 2G mark and ended up
passing negative args into ext2_getblk.  No wonder it got upset.
I've a patch I'll be sending you shortly for this, plus a bunch of other
bounds-checking problems in ext2.
