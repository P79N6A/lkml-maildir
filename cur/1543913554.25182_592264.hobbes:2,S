Why we need the second AT_IGNOREPPC entry here?
There is a mm_struct->saved_auxv overflow on PPC64 with AT_VECTOR_SIZE
== 44 (may be on PPC32 too, not checked) when adding all entries to
it. I've removed the second AT_IGNOREPCC from ARCH_DLINFO to prevent 
overflowing, checked it on IBM OpenPower 720 and a system (Fedora 7) is 
going on as well. Have I missed some tricky thing?
