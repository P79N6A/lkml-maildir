You can also look about some methods of "function redirection
hooks"... add some opcodes at the start of the "hooked function"
(something like to add a CALL or JMP pointing to the address of your
function). There are docs about this subject, but unfortunately I
couldn't find anything now (
http://www.ouah.org/p59-0x08.txt
 is not
exactly what I'm talking about, it's talking about ELF redirection).
It's a dirty thing to do, and it's not intended to be done in any
production thing (in fact, it's a *hack*).
