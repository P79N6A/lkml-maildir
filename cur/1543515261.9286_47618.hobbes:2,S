Yeah, minor thinko. I got one case but not the other. I've sent you
(privately) a new patch. Please try it and let me know (privately) if
it fixes the problem.

Puke! That's unbelievably ugly. Not only doesn't it work for devfs,
but it would also fail if you had some kind of daemon populating
/dev/pts. I think the right solution is something along the lines that
Stephan suggested: have libc speculatively try a Unix98 pty and if it
fails, set a flag for future reference and fall back to BSD ptys.
If the glibc people don't want to do a speculative test, then add a
similar hack for devfs. If the magic number for /dev is 0x1373 and
/dev/pts exists, then Unix98 ptys are available. This would be no more
ugly than what's there already.
