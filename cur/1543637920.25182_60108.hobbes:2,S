   To better answer your question, I just checked and indeed it seems all
   gcc's >= 2.95 are OK.
Some platforms (sparc64) are still using things like egcs-2.92.x
vintage compilers as their main supported kernel build compiler.
init/main.c allows 2.91 or greater to pass so that should be the rule
enforced kernel wide.
I don't remember when the empty initializer thing was fixed.
