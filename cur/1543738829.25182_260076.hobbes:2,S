The problem cases are on resume, where drivers
can see different controller state.  Both S4 and S5
resume can leave it in reset; fine.  But from S4
the other option is the controller being in the state
set up previously by the driver ... yet from S5 the
other option is boot firmware (BIOS etc) mucking
with it, leaving it in any of several states that are
not otherwise documented for resume() paths.
Drivers that don't reset the controller in resume()
will need special handling for those BIOS cases.
That means USB HCDs, and maybe not a lot else
yet in Linux.
