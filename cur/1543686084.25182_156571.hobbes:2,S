It is feature, not a bug. fbset does not work on 2.6.x kernels
anymore. Apply 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/matroxfb-2.6.0-t3-c1149.gz
if you prefer 2.4.x behavior.
Also if you are using DRI, even latest XFree mga driver I found still 
reprograms hardware even if XFree server is not on a foreground, so you 
must use same color depth and vxres for both X and console, and even in 
this configuration display corruption on console may occur from time to
time...
