Gigabit does NOT use cross over cables.  You connect gig ports with a
normal ethernet cable at all times unless you are connecting to a 10 or
100mbit port at the other end.  When running at gigabit speed, there are
4 pairs of wire in use with full duplex on all 4 pairs.  10 and 100mbit
have a single pair for data each way, and hence need the cross over when
not connecting to a switch/router.

Hopefully using the right cable type will solve the problem.
