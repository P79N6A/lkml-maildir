So you want a BSD licence...
There are strong reasons why GPL is a good thing and I prefer it to BSD.
IMO GPL makes it easier to add code to a common base without risking
someone taking the code and adding code+theircode and releasing a
proprietary competing project what's always 3 steps ahead of the open
source version.  For all the complaints it gets the GPL does what it's
designed to do and that's  a good thing.
