Which "personal disagreement"?
There was a hook for a binary-only module in the kernel, and as soon as 
Greg was made aware of it he removed it.

The policy in the kernel is quite liberal concerning non-free code 
(compare with e.g. the FSF and Debian).
I'd prefer it if non-GPL modules were completely forbidden, but although 
Linus stated himself that binary-only modules are a pain in the ass, 
they are tolerated in the Linux kernel.

Which "new policy"?
The fact that hooks for non-free modules are not allowed isn't new.

If non-GPL modules were simply completely forbidden, there would be no  
reason for you to complain...

Thankfully, the Linux kernel development is leaded by people for whom 
technical things are more important than marketing issues.
There are many examples like e.g. EVMS or the current reiser4 
discussion where "we really need it because of $important_reason" code 
isn't accepted as it is for this or that technical reason.
I might not always agree with a specific decision, but generally it 
leads in the long term to a better kernel.
