Subject: Broken scsi on 2.6.12rc4 + realtime-preempt-2.6.12-rc4-V0.7.47-03 ( adaptec aic7901a and lsi 53c1030 fusion-mpt )

The kernel with the realtime-preempt-2.6.12-rc4-V0.7.47-03 patch works
well on IDE.
I have a cannot open root device at boot on two machines ( i386 ) with
aic79xx or LSI controler.
If I suppress the realtime patch, it works.
I tried to set different options for realtime without success.
On the first machine  with LSI :
The lspci command shows :
...
04:03.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 PCI-X
Fusion-MPT Dual Ultra320 SCSI (rev 07)
04:03.1 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 PCI-X
Fusion-MPT Dual Ultra320 SCSI (rev 07)
...
On the second one with adaptec :
The lspci command shows :
...
03:05.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7901A U320 (rev 03)
...
During boot the following error occurs :
...
VFS: Cannot open root device "0806" or unknown-block(8,6)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(8,6)
Any idea ?
I can send more info.
