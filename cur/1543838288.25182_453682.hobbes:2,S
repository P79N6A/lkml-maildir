Yes, the field should account for memory usage until the kernel starts
doing the accounting at run time.
I'm actually surprised that taking into account the .bss was not enough to
cover up anything the decompressor was doing.  Usually the kernel's .bss
is more than the extra 32K or so that the decompressor uses.
