Hi, Anton.
arch/ppc64/Kconfig's entry for CONFIG_PREEMPT is missing the description
after the "bool" statement, so the entry does not show up.
Also, the help description mentions a restriction that is not [any
longer] true.
Patch against 2.6.0-test9.

 config PREEMPT
-	bool
+	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
 	help
 	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
 	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
 	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
-	  Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
-	  CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
-	  currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.
 
 	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
 	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.
