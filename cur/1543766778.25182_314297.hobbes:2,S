Subject: del_timer_sync needed for UP  RT systems.

Ingo,
In tracking down the failure of a system running the RT patch we have found a 
preemption between the time run_timer_list clears its spinlock and the call back 
function (in this case in posix-timers.c) gets its spinlock.  The bad news is 
that it is possible for the timer to be released at this point leaving the call 
back code with a pointer to a bogus timer.
This was/is possible, of course, in SMP systems and is why del_timer_sync() 
exists.  I suspect that del_timer_sync() needs to also do the "right thing" in 
UP RT systems.
This means removing the #ifdef CONFIG_SMP at about line 56 of kernel/timer.c 
thus setting up base->running_timer in all cases (or at least in SMP and RT 
cases) and also the #ifdef CONFIG_SMP around del_timer_sync() and, of course, 
the defines that redirect calls to these functions.
Does this make sense?
