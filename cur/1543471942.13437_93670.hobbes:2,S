IRQ10 should mean nothing. The clock runs on IRQ0. However, with my
new buggy-bios "thunder" motherboard, I found that moving an offending
card to the slot furtherest away from the CPU "fixes" things.
His screen card is not movable (AGP connector), however something
else might be.
So much for plug-and-play.
