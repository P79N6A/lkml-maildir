How do you get away with that? The last time I tried that, the other
machine had the kernel panic, couldn't open initial console, etc...so I
ran rdev on it to set the root device, and have been doing it that way
since.  Maybe I'll try it again w/2.2.11, since I stuck a new hd in that
machine to be root...  Does it matter that I'm compiling on /dev/sda1
but installing on /dev/hda1?  I've noticed that the compressed image
always returns /dev/sda1 as its default root device, when queried with
rdev.
