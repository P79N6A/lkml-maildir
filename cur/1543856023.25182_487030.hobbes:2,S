I don't want to change the API at all.  I'm using a closed-source, 3rd
party library.  Using strace, I can see that the library does *not* do
a setsockopt(...TCP_NODELAY...) on opened sockets.  Since I can't
change the library, I would like to patch and/or configure my kernel
so that all TCP/IP sockets default to TCP_NODELAY.
Also, if my understanding of Nagle is correct, I think you have that
backwards: Nagle should be disabled (i.e. TCP_NODELAY) for telnet,
mouse movements, etc: we always want to send our packets, regardless
of size or previous packet ACK.
Thanks,
Matt
