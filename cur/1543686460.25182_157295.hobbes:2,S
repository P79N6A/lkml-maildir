This ACPI update also fixes the irq routing issues I was seeing in 
2.4.22-rc2.  Previously, on Intel ICH5, I had to either disable 
CONFIG_ACPI (which makes my 2nd HT CPU disappear) and boot with 
'noapic', or disable CONFIG_SMP and boot with pci=noacpi.  If I did not 
do this, interrupts to the PCI slots would never be delivered.
With this update, 2.4 now matches 2.6 behavior:
full hyperthread, and interrupts routed correctly.
