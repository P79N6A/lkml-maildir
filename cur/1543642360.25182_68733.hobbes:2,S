which code relies on having debugged children only in the ->children list
and not in the ->ptrace_children list?

it just cannot happen. There are only two kinds of events passed via
wait4: tracing related and exit related. An exiting task is not traced
anymore. And two tasks cannot trace the same task - so it can never happen
that wait4 wants to look at ->ptrace_children for events.
