Subject: identd lookups broken after 2.2.10 upgrade

We just upgraded a number of redhat-5.2 machines to kernel 2.2.10 from
2.2.5 and noticed that identd client username lookups no longer work
as they should.  In particular, for in.rshd, in.rlogind and sshd
connections, the username returned is `root' regardless of who
initiates the connection.  For other services such as in.ftpd and
in.telnetd however, lookups continue to report the correct username as
they did before the upgrade to 2.2.10.
Does anyone know why this behavior might have changed with the kernel
upgrade?  We need to get things working as they did before.
Here is some syslog output illustrating the problem.  All three of
these commands were run from the `jason' account (not as root).  As
you can see, identd correctly looks up `jason' in the telnet example,
but for the next two, the username returned is `root'.  Under the
2.2.5 kernel, all three commands would have returned `jason' as the
connecting user.
