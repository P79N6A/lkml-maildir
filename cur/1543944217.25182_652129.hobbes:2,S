Kernel with broken sound:
hda_codec: Unknown model for ALC262, trying auto-probe from BIOS...
autoconfig: line_outs=1 (0x14/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   speaker_outs=0 (0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   hp_outs=2 (0x1b/0x15/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   mono: mono_out=0x0
   inputs: mic=0x18, fmic=0x19, line=0x0, fline=0x0, cd=0x0, aux=0x0
Kernel with fine sound:
hda_codec: Unknown model for ALC262, trying auto-probe from BIOS...
autoconfig: line_outs=1 (0x14/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   speaker_outs=0 (0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   hp_outs=2 (0x15/0x1b/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   mono: mono_out=0x0
   inputs: mic=0x18, fmic=0x19, line=0x0, fline=0x0, cd=0x0, aux=0x0
The machine has just headphone-out and mic-in audio connector, but it is 
equipped with port replicator connector, which may feature additional audio 
ports. (and which I unfortunately do not own)
Thanks, Matej
