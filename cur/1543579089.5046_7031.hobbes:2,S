I don't have the ServerWorks chipset documentation at hand, but I think your
patch is wrong -- it doesn't make any sense to scan a bus _range_. The registers
0x44 and 0x45 are probably ID's of two primary buses and the code should scan
both of them, but not the space between them.
Anyway, could you send me a `lspci -MH1 -vvx' and `lspci -vvxxx -s0:0', please?
				Have a nice fortnight
