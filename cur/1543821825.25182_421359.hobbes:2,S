Thanks for your email. I can certainly see the validity of the points you 
make - I guess it just goes to prove that there is often more than one way of 
looking at things :)
I didn't mention it previously - I guess because it was subconscious - but I'm 
looking at things from the point of view of someone maintaining an 
out-of-tree patch. With almost all of these revisions, my patch continues to 
apply cleanly, but I still get people asking "Is the patch for 2.6.16.9" safe 
to apply against "2.6.16.9+x"? I simply don't have the time to continually 
test and check, but I end up feeling like there's a new 2.6.x release 
everyday that I just have to keep up with, because that's what the stable 
users want. Maybe it just proves that I should hurry up and get the git tree 
finished so I get try to get Suspend2 merged :)

Nigel
