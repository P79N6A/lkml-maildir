That's certainly true and before claiming a kernel bug, I would try
against a Red Hat System personally. Still, lfs does have gcc patches
included, it's not just cvs checkout from the relevant packages. It also
seems to have a sane order of compiling everything.

That wasn't actually my idea. And you are right, before claiming a kernel
bug one should probably always try to reproduce it against a different
system.
