Hi Peter.  Thanks for your work on LBD for 2.5.x.  I'm really looking
forward to its inclusion.

What's wrong with EFI GUID scheme (GPT) (other than it wasn't invented by
Linux folks)?
the 2.5.x kernel understands it today
the 2.4.x kernel could very easily understand it (patch available on
http://domsch.com/linux/patches/gpt
 against 2.4.19-rc1), and ia64 has had it
for a couple years.
partx understands it today
parted understands it today
(efibootmgr and the EFI environment understand it today, but that's only
relevant to IA-64 at the moment)

The disk can tell you its blocksize.  The FS will have its own idea anyhow.

All of this is already done in GPT today, or could be if desired (spare,
etc).  Tagging the FS type inside the partition table isn't pretty, and has
lead to the huge table of partition type numbers that Andries maintains,
when fs probing isn't hard.

Sure, so we don't have to fix grub or lilo to understand GPT yet.  :-)
Unless there's something that GPT doesn't do well, I'd prefer not to make
yet another partitioning scheme.  If there is something else it needs, it
can be extended.
Thanks,
Matt
