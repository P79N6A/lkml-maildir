That sounds like normal behaviour. Linux uses up all unused memory as
buffers.
If the space is needed they will be released.
And a number of pages that havent been referenced for a while will be
swapped out.
You havent indicated anything that sounds like a problem. Is swapping
effecting the machine performance or anything?
