This is a submission of the ipath driver for inclusion in 2.6.17.
Roland, if this looks good to you, please apply.
Changes since the last round of review comments from Roland:
- Support for PathScale userland SMA dropped
- Passes sparse with CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__
- Builds cleanly on ia64
- A few other little fixes here and there
If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know.
The ipath driver is a driver for PathScale InfiniPath host channel
adapters (HCAs) based on the HT-400 and PE-800 chips, including the
InfiniPath HT-460, the small form factor InfiniPath HT-460, the InfiniPath
HT-470 and the Linux Networx LS/X.
The core driver manages the hardware, and provides a fast memory-mapped
interface to the hardware for userspace networking applications.
Our implementation of the Infiniband protocols and integration into the
kernel's Infiniband stack is written as a layer on top of the core driver.
