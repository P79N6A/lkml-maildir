Yes, it certainly does. I may be able to install windows in vmware or 
borrow a machine for it during the week to test the patch a bit myself, 
I'll see what I can do.

You're very welcome.
Would it be useful if I split the second patch into a few parts for you? I 
could split some of the (non cifs_open related) whitespace changes into 
one, the kfree related changes into another and then a third with the 
cifs_open rework. Would that make things easier for you?
