Thanks for doing that audit work. Can you please double check x86-64 code is
ok? 
Actually giving all that complexity maybe it would be better to just
stop handling the case and remove all that. I'm not sure what kprobes needs it 
for - it doesn't even handle user space yet and even if it ever does it is 
unlikely that handling 16bit code makes much sense. And the prefetch 
workaround does it, but 16bit DOS code is unlikely to contain prefetches 
anyways. And for ptrace - well, who cares? I suppose dosemu has an own
debugger anyways and it could be handled in user space (i suppose
they still have that code from 2.4 anyways)

That's a (small) security hole, isn't it?
