Ok, I've looked for places where someone actually tried using
the kernel headers by googling for /usr/include/asm/foo.h.
The good news is that marking these files broken in 
glibc-kernheaders has already pointed most authors to the
source of the problem.

Yes, it appears that most people who attempted to use this
have already been bitten so hard that they stopped trying.

netbase-ping6 tried to use it, along with some other applications that

Google found abuses of byteorder.h in kdeedu, dbootstrap and netatalk,
I would expect to find many more if I kept looking.

Ok, probably nobody has tried to do funny things with this one.

Surprisingly few abuses. It is already been protected with
#ifdef __KERNEL__ for some time.

I don't think it's that uncommon to use spinlocks in user
space, IIRC samba (tdb) and some databases implement their
own version of user spinlocks. The kernel implementation
is used at least in "Open Runtime Platform" and in "Chrony".
Chrony even has an FAQ entry on how to circumvent the 
"#ifndef __KERNEL__" that was added in Red Hat Linux...

At least one application that I use every day (vdr) tried including
asm/unaligned.h, but it's rather uncommon otherwise.

Right, this one has never been used from user space AFAICS.
