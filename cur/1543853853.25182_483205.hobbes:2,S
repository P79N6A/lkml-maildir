I don't think that's how you'd want to do it.
There's no way to do an initialization of a percpu allocation statically. 
That's pretty obvious.
What I'd suggest instead, is to make the allocation dynamic, and make it 
inside the srcu functions (kind of like I did now, but I did it at a 
higher level).
Doing it at the high level was trivial right now, but we may well end up 
hitting this problem again if people start using SRCU more. Right now I 
suspect the cpufreq notifier is the only thing that uses SRCU, and it 
already showed this problem with SRCU initializers.
So I was more thinking about moving my "one special case high level hack" 
down lower, down to the SRCU level, so that we'll never see _more_ of 
those horrible hacks. We'll still have the hacky thing, but at least it 
will be limited to a single place - the SRCU code itself.
