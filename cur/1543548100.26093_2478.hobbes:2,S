Somehow I doubt that arguments from marketshare/field circus/etc. peppered
with threats of coprorat world turning to Solaris, etc. will win you much
love from FreeBSD core team. I _really_ doubt that they will make any
effect on the development decisions. You see, these guys are bastards
too - comes with the territory. So are NetBSD and OpenBSD folks - try to
speak to Theo that way and you will realize that Linus _is_ a nice guy,
after all.
Could we please avoid bringing the moldy corpse of UniForum on l-k? Let
it rot in purgatory, where it belongs. There are valid arguments for and
against kernel dubuggers, but Wall Street and viability of someone's
business models have nothing to them.
