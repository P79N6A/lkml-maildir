Yes, and that's easy for glibc to achieve.
What's hard is that the user <-> kernel API firstly has a limited number
of registers available to it for passing arguments without indirection
from user space into kernel space.
Secondly, the user <-> kernel argument register allocation can vary
depending on the ABI version which user space or kernel space is built
for.  On ARM we have two ABIs, one where 64-bit arguments can be placed
in any two consecutive registers, and one where 64-bit arguments must
be placed in an even,odd register pair (not an odd,even pair.)
That leads to the above being:
fd	r0	r0
iovec	r1	r1
vecsz	r2	r2
offset	r3,r4	r4,r5
Notice the different register allocation for the 64-bit offset.
This problem of register-aligned argument placement is not limited
to just ARM, but several other Linux supported architectures.
