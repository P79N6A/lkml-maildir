Subject: interface inconsistancy between ipv4 and ipv6

I've noticed that while ipv4 responds to a given ip no matter what
interface the request is on but ipv6 only responds on the interface the
address is attatched to.
Is there a reason for the diffrence?  It seems rather odd to me that they
aren't the same.
