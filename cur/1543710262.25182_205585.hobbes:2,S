This is NOT the responsibility of the mapping system! I'm not
implementing a new network file system. All I do, is supply a system
that tells the client that what the server refers to as gid 26 is gid
523 locally. Who is a member and who is not is irrelevant!

That's funny. I thought it was the privilege of the designer to decide
what he has tried to design. When did this change?
I'll repeat it just one more time:
Imagine two systems with all the same users on them. The users however
have different uid's on the two systems. This fscks up the ownerships. I
fix this by translating the uid's before they hit the wire. Well,
actually before they hit the nfs layer. Behold! All is well, and all
users have access to their own files.

Let's just for a second assume that I'm the slow one here. Why is the
world a less secure place after this system is incorporated into the
kernel?

Really? Dang, I need rewrite the entire thing now! (I BTW still reserve
the right to be sarcastic and to make other good analogies).
