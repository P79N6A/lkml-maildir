The problem I've got happen when an app registers the memory with the
driver, releases the memory back to the kernel thru sbrk(-n) or
munmap()s it. Then get new memory thru sbrk(+n) or mmap() which then get
the same vaddr. 
mapping from vaddr to phys addr happen at the registration point. 
Querying the kernel for a vaddrs  phys addr every time it's used is too
costly. There is a better explanantion in a earlier post.

Some don't use (g)libc, but do syscalls directly.
