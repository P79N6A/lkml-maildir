Andrew,
	Can you drop fix-race-between-attach_task-and-cpuset_exit.patch
and take this fix instead, which addresses some points raised by Paul
Menage?
Currently cpuset_exit() changes the exiting task's ->cpuset pointer w/o
taking task_lock().  This can lead to ugly races between attach_task and
cpuset_exit.  Details of the races are described at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/24/132.
Patch below closes those races.  It is against 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 and has
undergone a simple compile/boot test on a x86_64 box.
