What are you using as a boot loader? This may be a problem with
the boot loader not turning off the floppy drive motor before
it transfers control to Linux. With no built-in floppy driver,
the motor would never turn off. With quick boot hard-disks,
the floppy motor may still be ON from the initial BIOS access.
Just for kicks, change the order of boot devices in your
BIOS so that the floppy is never accessed during boot. This
should verify the problem.
Cheers,
