It sounds a lot like (BSD's?) union mount.

What about appends to files on the lower, RO mount?

Under union-mount, the upper layer holds changes to the lower layer, so
conflict behavior is well defined:  The upper layer wins.
(I'm not sure about a delete of a file that exists on both layers.  Is
a 'deleted' entry stored on the upper FS layer?  Hmmm.)

I like the union mount, and it's very similar to yours.  I'd love to 
see it in linux; I'll help, if you like.
