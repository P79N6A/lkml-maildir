I'm using the latest linus bk version
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 6
EXTRAVERSION =-rc1
NAME=Zonked Quokka
hmm:
cate@catee:~/kernel/5,v2.5/bk/linus-2.5$ find include/ | grep audit
include/linux/SCCS/s.audit.h
include/config/audit.h
but no include/linux/audit.h as used in include/linux/fs.h
Corrupted local bk?
ciao
