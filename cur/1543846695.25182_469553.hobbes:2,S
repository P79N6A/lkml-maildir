Subject: [patch 06/22] time: fix timeout overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/4/278

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Prevent timeout overflow if timer ticks are behind jiffies (due to high
softirq load or due to dyntick), by limiting the valid timeout range to
MAX_LONG/2.
