Do you think cpu wakeup alone could be doing this? If so, then doing
that bit would be relatively isolated (though a slightly larger diff
than changing an NMI oopser timeout).
Does 0xFF broadcast cluster, broadcast low nybble work or is waking
them a cluster at a time required?  This thing is not swift to boot...
Thanks,
Bill
