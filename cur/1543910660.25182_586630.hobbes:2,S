As Herbert has said already, people can code for this just like
they have to code for RDMA.
There is no fundamental difference from converting an application
to sendfile or similar.
The only thing this needs is a
"recvmsg_I_dont_care_where_the_data_is()" call.  There are no alignment
issues unless you are trying to push this data directly into the
page cache.
Couple this with a card that makes sure that on a per-page basis, only
data for a particular flow (or group of flows) will accumulate.
People already make cards that can do stuff like this, it can be done
statelessly with an on-chip dynamically maintained flow table.
And best yet it doesn't turn off every feature in the networking nor
bypass it for the actual protocol processing.
