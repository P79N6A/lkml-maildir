Actually, taking i_sem is completely wrong. Look at vfs_unlink() in 
fs/namei.c:
        down(&dentry->d_inode->i_sem);
        if (d_mountpoint(dentry))
                error = -EBUSY;
        else {
                error = dir->i_op->unlink(dir, dentry);
                if (!error)
                        d_delete(dentry);
        }
        up(&dentry->d_inode->i_sem);
Then, in driverfs_unlink:
	struct inode *inode = dentry->d_inode;
	down(&inode->i_sem);    
You didn't test this on file removal did you? A good way to verify that 
you have most of your bases covered is to plug/unplug a USB device a few 
times. I learned that one from Greg, and it's caught several bugs.
Anyway, I say that the lock can be removed altogether. Ditto for mknod as 
well.
