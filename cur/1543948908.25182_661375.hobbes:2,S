With the SGI supplied reference implementation it ought to be a
small matter of work to write an RFC. If the information weren't
SGI proprietary I could even tell you how long it ought to take
a junior engineer in Melbourne to write. The fact that there is
currently no RFC does not mean that there cannot be a RFC, only
that no one has written (or published) one yet.
