Just earlier today, with 2.3.49 (along with tytso's one-line patch to
softirq.c), processes like 'w' and 'ps' stopped returning.  Instead
they did the whole "claim to be chewing up cycles and killing the load
average while really doing nothing because the system stays
responsive" game.
I wasn't local to the box, so I just opened up a lot of ssh
connections and tried to figure out what could be up before rebooting.
I strace(1)'d both of them, and they both block with output like:
--- SNIP ---

open("/proc/217/stat", O_RDONLY)        = 7

stat("/proc/5700", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0555, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
open("/proc/5700/stat", O_RDONLY)       = 7
read(7, 
Both 'ps' and 'w' blocked on the same process, 5700.  What is process
5700, you might ask?  I dunno, I couldn't figure it out either.  If I
tried to look in /proc myself, my shell died too, of course.
So that's my mysterious story.  I had to reboot the box because, even
though I'm running 2.3.x kernels, it is occasionally useful and having
random processes getting stuck wasn't good.  If anyone has ideas of
why it happened, or how I can look harder the next time it does
happen, etc., and/or just wants to fix whatever bug it could be, I'd
love to hear it.
