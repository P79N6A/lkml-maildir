I'm not.
I'm just saying that TiVO, as a licensee of Linux, agreed that it
wouldn't impose further restrictions on recipients of Linux on the
exercise of the rights granted by the license.
So, just like it couldn't use a patent to stop people from modifying
or sharing Linux, it can't use the hardware to do that.
And if they fail to supply portions of the functional source code in
order to prevent modified versions to run, they are infringing the
spirit and quite possibly the letter of the license.
