	[large patch]
I've been finding small bugs in both my late-night code and in
Mike's code and have redone the changes in do_anonymous_page(),
do_no_page() and do_swap_page() much more carefully...
Now the code is beautiful and it might even be bugfree ;)
If you feel particularly adventurous, please help me test the
patch; it is available from:
