This tends to turn into a very messy API - thats perhaps one big ALSA problem.
You need a lot of code to implement the mixer and also a lot of code to show
a good conceptual map of the mixer for a configuration tool
> * 3D audio, maybe in userspace
Some chips do bits of this in hardware - the ESS Maestro has delay line modes
for example so you can do delay shifting to model objects at a distance and
echoes in hardware. The newest cards have some of the 3D modelling in
hardware.

Exposing the streams is already handled by OSS (ok we might want the odd
extra major)

Yep.

Which internals ?
> * some control over bass boost and the like
That is easy to add to OSS. The 3D spacialiser was added recently, stuff
like Bass boost isnt a problem.
It is on the synth side that ALSA is way better.
