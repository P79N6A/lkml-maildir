It would be absolutely magic if all the cylinder, head and sector geometry
stuff could be ultimately removed all together. I see problems in hdparm
reporting ridiculous disk geometry on my 20GB disk.
I think this is a legacy which unfortunately still lives on. As far as the
kernel goes, it could simply export only the size of disks in terms of the
number of sectors on the disk (and the sector size), ie LBA information
(breaking some user-land tools).
Would the only reason to have CHS information exported to user-land be for
tools such as [c]fdisk doing cylinder-alignment on partitions for
compatibility purposes? (even if the BIOS and/or drives do not support LBA
addressing, the kernel could just report LBA information)
Is this the current situation, or am I missing something?
