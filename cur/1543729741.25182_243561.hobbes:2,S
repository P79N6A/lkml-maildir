Hi Andrew,
Just annoying your arse, I get this:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xa1bde): In function `radeon_match_mode':
: undefined reference to `vesa_modes'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xa1cbd): In function `radeon_match_mode':
: undefined reference to `vesa_modes'
make: ** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Erro 1
Known already?
