It would be nice if [kernel] git commits had a flag [a char] (or a 
combination of) describing their main purpose which could be the following:
bug Fix [F]
Speed up/Performance [S]
Revert [R]
New functionality [N]
etc.
So a particular commit at 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux
%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux-2.6.git;a=summary
will look like:
19 hours ago 	Ingo Molnar 	sched: fix fair sleepers 	[F] commit | 
commitdiff | tree | snapshot
This way it will be much easier to keep track of important changes 
happening to the kernel.
