[ sorry, and i didnt go into 'attack mode'. I believe you'll distinctly 
  notice when i do that :-) ]
just think NUMA, and the generic advantages of PER_CPU become obvious.  
(via PER_CPU the different data structures indexed can properly end up 
on another domain's RAM, and can thus improve caching characteristics.)
