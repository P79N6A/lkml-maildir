Hmm? Smells like a stupid bug to me. The script is called as:
CCFOUND :=$(shell $(CONFIG_SHELL) scripts/kwhich kgcc gcc272 cc gcc)
So how can bash ever decide to replace scripts/kwhich (OBVIOUSLY
a call to a non-internal command) with an alias or builtin?
Are you sure this is in fact the bug?
Couldn't it be the games with IFS in the scripts/kwhich script?
Try this patch:
