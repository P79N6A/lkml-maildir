Thanks!
The isapnp=0 fixed it.  I don't actually have an isapnp.conf file.
On my next compile I'll just disable the ISA Pnp driver.
I don't actually need it, but it's something that I've never bothered to
turn off. :)

... Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer,
my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any
resemblance between the above and my own views is non-deterministic.  The
question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them
is left as an exercise for the reader.  The question of the existence of
the reader is left as an exercise for the second god coefficient.  (A
discussion of non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope
of this article.)
