If anyone's interesting in the Very Sneaky option, here's a little
test program to judge its feasibility.
You can do an even nicer thing with timer 2, the speaker timer, since
it keeps counting mod-65536 when not in use, but coping with console
beeps or the PC speaker driver would be a nightmare.
On 4 machines (laptop, two desktops, and amd64), timer 1 is always
programmed for mode 2 (status = 0x94) with a cout of 18 (0x12).  This
does not divide any of the standard timer rate divisors (including the
AMD Elan versions).  However, collecting hitograms, I do see occasional
glitches:
Timer 1 status = 94
  1: 34
  3: 133
  4: 34
  6: 132
  7: 33
  9: 133
 10: 33
 12: 134
 13: 33
 15: 134
 16: 33
 18: 133
181: 1
(AMD64, nForce4 chipset - why it has a "refresh timer" when it doesn't
have any RAM attached is a mystery)
Also, it appears to take very nearly 3 us to latch the
count and read the timer, resulting in histograms like:
Timer 1 status = 94
  1: 167
  4: 167
  7: 166
 10: 166
 13: 167
 16: 167
Anyway, if anyone else would like to try, the following program should
be very conservative and not kill your machine.  Still, it disables
interrupts and does raw hardware accesses.  In fact, since nobody else
should be touching timer 1, the interrupt disabling is probably not
necessary, but I'd still be cuatious running it on an SMP system.
