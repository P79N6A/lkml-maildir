Greetings,
I keep running into a deadlock with it looping forever trying to
free memory, triggered by blocking in getblk->refill_freelist->..
try_to_free_buffers->sync_page_buffers->zzzzz (kflushd runs forever).
The below seems to cure it.  Without this, I can lock my box without
much effort.  I beat on this pretty hard with no ill effects noted.
