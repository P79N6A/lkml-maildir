Subject: knfs lock problem in 2.2.1

	I have knfsd running on a linux 2.2.1 box that exports my 
home directory.  On a different linux 2.2.1 I mount my home directory
and run the code at the end (it comes from GNU queue-1.11 so don't 
blame me) on the client (that has nfs mounted the directory).
It prints
Lock error: No locks available
In /var/log/messages I find
kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 192.168.1.1
(naturally 192.168.1.1 is the server).
Should this work?  I've tried a couple of patches I've seen
posted here by HJ Lu but none of them solved this.
