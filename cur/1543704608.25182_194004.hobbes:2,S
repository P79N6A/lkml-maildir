Yes, it fixes my test_wp_bit oops. But NOW, when booting 2.6.2-rc1-mm3 (which 
i pathed removing -funit-at-a-time and the wp_but oops patch) I get an oops 
derefrencing null pointer in blkdev_reread_part.
I booted normal and with vga=ask acpi=off
Here is a close approxamation of what I wrote down by hand. 
raid1: raid set md1 active..(blah blah)
Unable to handle null dereference at virtual address 0000008c025b893
*pde = 00000000
oops = 0000 [#1]

	Let me know if you need more (or more accurate) debugging info. I am very 
sorry if I have copied something down incorrectly. If I have, I guess its a 
great time to learn how to set a up serial console :)
