I have a similar problem concerning an Asus SC200 NcR53C810-based SCSI-card.
The kernel version (2.0.34/35/37pre4) doesnt matter -- I tracked it down to
the device driver. Using the old driver NCR53c7,8xx works, the dedicated
NCR58c8xx-driver runs into problems (and yes, I tried to fiddle around with
tagged commands etc).
Now here's what happening: I have an old 2 GB SCSI DAT-streamer from Maynard
attached to my SCSI bus. Writing to it will work fine for a while but then
the bus will hang, eventually resetting (sometimes not). Running xcdroast
(which seems to scan the SCSI-bus) will report my CD-ROM-drive (the last
before my streamer -- last entry in the log), then will freeze the entire
system. At one instant I could see the system recover with an SCSI-bus
reset. As I mentioned above, using the old driver solves all the problems,
while reducing I/O throughput quite a bit.
If it would be useful for you, I could run another test with my streamer
writing down the exact error messages.
