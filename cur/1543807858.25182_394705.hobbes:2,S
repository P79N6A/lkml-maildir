It occured to me as soon as I sent the last email (don't you hate that!)
that I'd forgotten the original impetus: backwards compatibility. If all
of the methods of suspending can be started with
"echo disk > /sys/power/state"
, your backwards compatability issue that you expressed concern about 
earlier in this discussion is addressed. So, I'm not sure that dropping the
idea is the right thing to do.

Nigel
