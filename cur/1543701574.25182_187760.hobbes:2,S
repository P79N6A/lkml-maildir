Short addition: in the earlier thread, it was suggested to inspect the disk
with another OS (DOS, Windows, something else) to rule out Linux kernel
completely. I couldn't easily find anything that boots from cd or preferably
from floppy (since I don't have cdrom attached due to ide cable shortage)
*and* supports the HPT370 ide controller /dev/hdg is connected to.
If I find something that fits the bill, I'll give it a shot.
