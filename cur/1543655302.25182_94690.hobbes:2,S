Yes, there are helper functions for this, they can all be found in pnp.h.
static inline void *pnp_get_drvdata (struct pnp_dev *pdev)
{
	return dev_get_drvdata(&pdev->dev);
}
static inline void pnp_set_drvdata (struct pnp_dev *pdev, void *data)
{
	dev_set_drvdata(&pdev->dev, data);
}
static inline void *pnpc_get_drvdata (struct pnp_card *pcard)
{
	return dev_get_drvdata(&pcard->dev);
}
static inline void pnpc_set_drvdata (struct pnp_card *pcard, void *data)
{
	dev_set_drvdata(&pcard->dev, data);
}

Adam
