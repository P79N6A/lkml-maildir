Ok, so maybe do it in this way:
1. common headers (included by 2. and 3.)
2. kernel headers (things only for kernel + included 1.)
3. userspace headers (things only for userspace + included 1.)
This way we will have no ifdefs, one definition per thing, user code in 
userspace and kernel code in kernelspace only.

Are you talking about breaking userspace (API and ABI) compatibility? And 
possibly breaking compatibility with older versions of standards? I do not 
think it could happen. (Well at least not for common widely-used APIs).
Instead we can place such userspace only hacks in 3.
