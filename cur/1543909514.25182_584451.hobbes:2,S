Subject: [PATCH] Fix VM_FAULT flags conversion for hugetlb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It seems a simple mistake was made when converting follow_hugetlb_page()
over to the VM_FAULT flags bitmask stuff:
	(commit  83c54070ee1a2d05c89793884bea1a03f2851ed4).
By using the wrong bitmask, hugetlb_fault() failures are not being
recognized.  This results in an infinite loop whenever
follow_hugetlb_page is involved in a failed fault.
