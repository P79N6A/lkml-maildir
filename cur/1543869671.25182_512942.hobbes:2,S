This seems to be what's triggering the apparent memory corruption we've
been seeing recently -- in the case of the Fedora kernel it manifests
itself as a BUG() in cache_alloc_refill() when the pmac ide driver
initialises.
Another report was at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/17/4
We've been seeing it on a Mac Mini too, and I managed to reproduce it on
my shinybook this evening by booting with 'mem=512M'.
One side-effect of this patch is to move the call to free_initrd() much
later in the init sequence, potentially after other memory management
code is assuming it's already been freed.
