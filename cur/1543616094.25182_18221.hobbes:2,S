I've had no other instablility problems, and downgrading gkrellm to the 
previous version seems to have stopped it dying.  Mozilla started being 
very unstable at the same time..  it could just be a coincidence that 
they all happened at the same time.

I'll run it & see if anything fails.

Their website says not to report bugs unless you're prepared to do a 
fair bit of debugging yourself.  It also says individual problems won't 
normally be dealt with...  I took the hint and didn't bother.
