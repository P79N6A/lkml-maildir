this falls in the same risky category of the vary-I/O patch from Badari
(check the discussion on l-k) for rawio, so to make it safe it also will
need to check for the same new per-blkdev bitflag before you can trigger
the scaling (if the bitflag says 'no', it will have to enforce
softblocksize b_size etc). (and then you will get the same optimization
in brw_kiovec as well as rawio, also while not doing softblocksize
aligned I/O, but still large I/O) So I suggest you to check Badari's
stuff and the thread on l-k and to make a new patch incremental with his
code (note: I still had some problem with his latest patch but it's not
far from a final version)
