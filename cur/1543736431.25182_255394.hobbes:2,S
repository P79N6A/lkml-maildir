First of all, unnecessary kernel code where it is not needed.  And
second, because with the definition of the CPUTIME clock in use for many
years now not all variants can be handled in the kernel.  We use this
clock to provide access to the TSC functionality.  This is nothing the
kernel does.

No, you don't know the glibc side.

I haven't gotten an answer to the question "is there really any value in
this kind of clock?".
