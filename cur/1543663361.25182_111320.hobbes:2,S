I did some disk I/O and CPU benchmarks, including bonnie++, hdparm, nbench,
unixbench, dbench, tiotest. I haven't done any network/memory testing yet,
the onboard Broadcom and Intel gigabit controllers both seem to work quite
well. I have taken care to make sure that the 3ware card has its own PCI bus,
in this case slot 5. I have not disabled hyperthreading but I am not sure why
I would.
On that note, I have also done benchmarking with a Supermicro E7500 board
(P4DPR, Intel Gigabit 82544GC onboard controller), the tests I ran included
Netperf, Netperf3, NetPIPE (TCP), Tbench, nttcp, Aim9 and the ones I
mentioned above. It seemed that if I had two identical machines hooked up
directly (back to back with CAT5E crossover cable), the performance would be
a lot better and is very consistent. I tried different combinations
HT=on/off, CPU affinity, IRQ affinity, SMP/UP. Some results were:
Supermicro
=========
Netperf Result (MB/s) - 112.21
Netperf3 Result (MB/s) - 112.22
Tbench Result (MB/s) - 114.48
Nttcp Result (Mb/s) - 946.55
However, if I hook it up to a different machine, problems started to occur.
For example, with the Tyan S2720 Thunder i7500  board (E7500 chipset, Intel
82544EI onboard gigabit controller), I see good performance on the Tyan but
not Supermicro.
Supermicro
=========
Netperf Result (MB/s) - 29.23
Netperf3 Result (MB/s) - 78.19
Tbench Result (MB/s) - 117.32
Nttcp Result (Mb/s) - 646.77
Tyan
====
Netperf Result (MB/s) - 112.22
Netperf3 Result (MB/s) - 112.02
Tbench Result (MB/s) - can't find it
Nttcp Result (Mb/s) - 945.9
