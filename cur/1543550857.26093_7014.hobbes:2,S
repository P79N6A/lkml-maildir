This really should be documented, somewhere.
For example swapping over nbd to localhost can not work.
Swapping over nbd to any other host can not work, too; but it might be
fixable.
Swapping to /dev/loop* probably can not work.
Swapping to file on nfs does not work.
Perhaps this should be added to Documentation/swap.txt?
(Rik, you know about this issues... Do you feel like creating
Documentation/swap.txt?)
