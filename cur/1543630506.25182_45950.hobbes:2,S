Right, I see that as the only right way to get the right synchronization
too.

Hmm yes, hardsect_size comes to mind. It will just have to be 'lowest
common denominator' for a while I suppose.

I think you are mixing up two very different serialization issues. A
shared queue lock will indeed protect however much you want, but only at
the queue level. It will _not_ provide synchronization for hardware
access in any sane way, like a shared queue between two devices will.
You could alternatively move requests to an internal queue of your own
width, that would synchronize drive operations at any level you want
(you set the rules). The block layer can still sanely handle the locking
for you, the scope of that lock will just be a bit wider.
