Yes, the PCI RAM will be very slow compared to normal RAM.  I don't think it
will help much.  But if you insist, ...
the easiest way is to create another Zone, and modify the zonelist structures
to use that Zone as a backup zone for ZONE_NORMAL.  Then, whenever you run out
of normal RAM, it will allocate your PCI RAM.
There's a linux-mm mailing list that might be more useful, if you decide to
pursue this.
