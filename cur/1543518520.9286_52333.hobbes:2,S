This is a bug, but it didnt have any bad effect so far because nothing
really tried to use highpages for direct swapping or direct IO. The
attached onliner fixes this.
free_page() doesnt use PG_DMA anymore, it's freeing stuff based on
page->zone. Probably other places should use page->zone as well, not
PG_DMA.
