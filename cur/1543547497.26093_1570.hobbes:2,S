Hmm, I think this shouldn't be tied too closely to TCP. E.g. you can
probably play wonderful ALF tricks with raw sockets.
For TCP/UDP, such a restriction may be useful, but then it shouldn't
be visible to the application, or route changes on multi-homed systems
with different hardware on those ports would be great fun.
