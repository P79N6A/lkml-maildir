Ah, Karsten Keil did a similar patch some months ago. There is 
clearly a need.
But I think this should be self tuning instead. For a machine with 
less than 900MB of memory the vmalloc area can be automagically increased,
growing into otherwise unused address space. 
This way many users wouldn't need to specify weird options.  So far
most machines still don't have more than 512MB.
