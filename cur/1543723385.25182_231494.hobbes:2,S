No, I am preserving the feature that the child doesn't go away in this case.
ptraced threads always become zombies and let the ptracer see their exit
notification and status value.  That is the way we want it to stay.
Linus makes the same point:

In fact, the exit code is usually completely uninteresting for a
CLONE_THREAD thread (after all, ptrace is the *only* way to see that value,
so the _exit call didn't expect to pass useful information that way).
However, the reliable notification of the fact that the thread died is very
useful for anything tracing/debugging it.
Thanks,
Roland
