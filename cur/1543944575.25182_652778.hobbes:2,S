i didnt get very far with bisection. .23 definitely did not crash and 
booted up fine - but it produced the "Bad IO ..." messages - so my 
automated bisector scripts which turned that warning into a crash&reboot 
honed in on the wrong (and probably uninteresting) area. .24 had 
timeouts but no crash. .25-rc1 had the crash. So it seems like multiple 
IDE regressions building up a concert of failures here, and it's hard to 
sort them out.
If an IDE/PATA/SATA person could take a look at the various logs i 
posted and could suggest the most efficient way to proceed it could save 
me from having to blindly spend hours on this problem.
