Yep, you're right: you'd need to ascend the target directory tree,
increasing the cumulative size all the way up, then do the move and
decrement the old location's totals in the same way. All wrapped up in a
transaction (on journalled FSs) or have fsck rebuild the totals on a dirty
mount. Fairly clean and painless on a JFS, but a bit of a mess on
others - still, quite workable, and the performance hit shouldn't be too
bad. Better than walking all the way DOWN the tree, anyway...
