Kai,
Thanks for the analysis.
Some background documents for those interested:
The SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) draft:
   
http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/drafts/sat/sat-r09.pdf
in which the relevant section is 12.2.6 (page 110)
table 93.
A modern descriptor-based SCSI sense buffer is being used
to convey the "ATA (status) return descriptor" back from
the ATA device after the command has been completed.
My SAT code in smartmontools requests this descriptor
so it should be returned irrespective of whether the
ATA command succeeded or failed.
Now from the ATA side the command being executed is
"SMART RETURN STATUS  B0h/DAh, non-data". For
reference I use this draft from www.t13.org :
D1699r3f-ATA8-ACS.pdf . See that command's
_description_ section. That explains that 4f and c2
in the LBA field indicates the disk is healthy. "threshold
exceeded" is indicated by putting f4 and 2c in the same
positions. [Whoever specified that must have hated people
with dyslexia.] No ATA command error is indicated ("abort"
is the only one listed for that ATA command) in the reports
that I have seen.
So when smartmontools sees 0 and 0 in those positions it
pulls out the red card for that device. My guess is that
libata in lk 2.6.22 is corrupting those FIS device to
host register values.
