Agreed, I just sent a note on this, but apparently it "crossed
in the mail" with yours.  The key point about MPS is that MPS
should not describe pins that can never be connected -- so that isn't
quite as bad as handing out a vector for every RTE, which is what the
code appears to do on first read...

Yeah, it isn't clear that this has any advantage over assigning
the vector at request_irq() time where one would expect to see it.
Though some might consider "currently working" an advantage:-)

No, I don't think we have the license to intentionally break big
machines
that are currently working.  In the long run, these two big-machine
hacks should go away:
mp_register_gsi()
	/*
	 * For PCI devices, assign IRQs in order, avoiding gaps
	 * due to unused I/O APIC pins.
	 */
	...
io_apic_set_pci_routing() (x86_64 only upstream, i386 too on SuSE)
	irq = gsi_irq_sharing(irq)
I think what we can do in the short term is to make these workarounds
not have any effect on the systems which don't need them.  This means
searching like gsi_irq_sharing() does, instead of always compressing
like mp_register_gsi() does.  It also means not printing dmesg
about vector sharing when no sharing is actually happening.

Based on past history of the un-intended impact of interrupt changes,
(eg. what started this thread)
I would suggest that only the simplest things go into 2.6.18
and that the larger changes stay in -mm for all of 2.6.18
and targtet 2.6.19.
