Actually, just a single patch for all the coupled drivers would be
better, please.

These prototypes are all unnecessary and can be pulled out of the
individual header files.  The first two are provided by wd33c93.h and
the last one isn't actually in the body of any file.
wd33c93_info is also unused and can go.
Thanks,
