Ingo and I have some minor disagreements about how the NMI on UP patch
should be done.  My current version is in
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/upapic-2.4.0-test9-C3-K3.gz.
  It is Ingo's
patch plus my reinstatement of bits that he removed but that I believe
are required, especially for SMP boxes.  Moving clear_local_APIC() from
setup_local_APIC() back to connect_bsp_APIC() fixes the lock up in
Calibrating delay loop, this is included in my patch.
