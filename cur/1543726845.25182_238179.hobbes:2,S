Ok, I will write it down next time ;-) It happens during the boot
process, but I will try to get it happen after login by starting hotplug
by hand.

Hmm, haven't tested this yet, always running -mm kernels.

No, definitely not. I think it only depends on the modules loaded, and
if usb is modular then input is loaded after psmouse/mousedev and this I
cannot reverse, because I cannot get mousedev/psaux to be build modular.

LOWTHER (vb.)
(Of a large group of people who have been to the cinema together.) To
stand aimlessly about on the pavement and argue about whatever to go
and eat either a Chinese meal nearby or an Indian meal at a restaurant
which somebody says is very good but isn't certain where it is, or
have a drink and think about it, or just go home, or have a Chinese
meal nearby - until by the time agreement is reached everything is
shut.
