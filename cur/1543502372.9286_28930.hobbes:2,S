It means they have a wider range of hardware to choose from w/o having
to negotiate for specs and write their own drivers.  The result being
that they can -- I'm sure they expect -- get to market sooner w/ less
cost.  Based on the letter referenced at /., this is _the_ reason they
switched from QNX to Linux.
Or at least that is how I read it.  I could be wrong.... (w/ apologies to DM :)
