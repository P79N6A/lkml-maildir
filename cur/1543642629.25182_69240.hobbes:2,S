if you have noisy cables and someone turns off udma,
yes, you could certainly see corruption.  if you can
possibly ever use udma, it's a very good idea to do so;
only with it are transfers checksummed.  80-conductor 
cables are always advantageous as well, though only 
required over udma33.  (remember that valid IDE cables 
are always <= 18" long, with no stubs...)
