OK. Apart from the fact whether we would want this piece of
code in the kernel (it's probably useful for some short-sliced
RT tasks), there's one big performance killer in your patch
that really should be removed...
In kernel/sched.c::goodness(), we see this code snippet:

You have to realize that goodness() is called for each process
on the runqueue for each reschedule. And this is only needed
once every rebind...
We should probably drop this piece of code in favor of a trick
done at rebinding (for example: just setting p->processor to a
wanted processor).
