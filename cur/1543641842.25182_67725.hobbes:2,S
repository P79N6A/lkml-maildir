Hi all...
I have seen the new IDE patch at 
http://www.linuxdiskcert.org/
:
http://www.linuxdiskcert.org/ide-2.4.20-pre4-ac2.1.patch.bz2
It is done against -pre4-ac4 (highmem IO was introduced in -pre2, so I
suppose it is highio-aware).
Ist not there any version for plain 2.4.19 ? Does it depend on any
specific bits from -ac ? If yes, would this bit easily extracted ?
TIA
