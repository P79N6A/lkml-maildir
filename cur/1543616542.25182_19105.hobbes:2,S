I'm struggling to see a use for generic_buffer_fdatasync().  Maybe
for a filesystem which doesn't implement ->writepage()?  Dunno.
The only places where waitfor_one_page() is used are in the
directory-in-pagecache filesystems, for synchronous directories.
And the usage there seems completely incorrect.
They call ->commit_write(), which leaves the buffers dirty
and unlocked, then they call waitfor_one_page(), which does nothing
at all because the buffers are unlocked.  I/O was never started,
we didn't sync the blocks.
I feel I'm missing somethng here, because I checked that code
a few months back.  hmmm..

This code is untested, and there is no way for us to test it.
And now we think it may be deadlocky.  It has to go.
But the withdrawal of an exported API from 2.4.x is a policy
decision for Marcelo to make.

Heh.  I'll do the death-to-generic_buffer_fdatasync patch, and
I'll check whether we need to convert the dir-in-pagecache
filesytems over to writepage/wait_on_page.
