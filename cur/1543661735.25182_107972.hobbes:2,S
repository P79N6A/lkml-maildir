Also similar stuff in IDE code in 2.4.21-pre4 from bk tree:

At least looking at another similar code that is ifdefed out, it seems below patch is correct.
(and even if it's not, still that code should be changed not to confuse people ;) )
Also I took a look at drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c in 2.5 hoping I can see what should
be in fact done and got even more confused ;)
Sounds like in 2.5 there should be "return ide_started" at the end, not stopped,
because otherwise when drive->using_dma is set, we always return ide_stopped for
WIN_WRITEDMA.*, WIN_IDENTIFY_DMA and WIN_READDMA, WIN_READDMA_ONCE, WIN_READDMA_EXT
taskfile->command and default case is the same (we check stuff, and then regardless
or the result of the check we always return ide_stopped).
Which looks somehow strange (and different from similar code in 2.4).
Can please somebody take a look at it?
Bye,
    Oleg
