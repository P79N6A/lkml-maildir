I never even implied that you would run CD-ROM or FD in embedded
applications. The stuff that runs comes-from ROM, actually NVRAM so
in can be written/updated in production. However, EIP software
(Execute In Place) has always been a dog and, even Ethernet switches
3COM, Cisco, etc., don't run that way. You need to get the stuff
that runs into RAM.
Security isn't a problem with embedded systems because everything
that could possibly be done is handled with a "monitor". There is
no shell. If there is no way to execute some foreign executable,
you don't have a security issue unless some dumb alleged software
engineer added some back-doors to the monitor.
