No - it's not broken.  Powering off the slot if it is not occupied is the
right thing to do - the controller when it is working properly will detect
the presence of a new adapter and interrupt.  
I'll try to duplicate your problem on a piece of hardware that has proper
firmware support and validated hardware and then we'll go from there.
We could very well have software problems, especially with ExpressCard
since most pciehp use is for servers, but we should make sure we aren't
writing workarounds for broken hardware first.
