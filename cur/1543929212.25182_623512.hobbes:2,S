Could you please run evtest on the mouse device and send me what is 
reported when these false double-clicks happen? Also providing debug 
output of usbhid might or might not be helpful (*)
There were not that many changes in USB HID apart from adding per-device 
quirks for specific broken devices. Could you please try reverting 
c01d50d18, 933e3187, 82eb1219 to see if any of them makes this go away? 
(*) this means compiling with CONFIG_HID_DEBUG and modprobing hid module 
with 'debug=1'.
Thanks,
