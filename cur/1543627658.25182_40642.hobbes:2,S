Yes I saw this with M/O disks, thats one reason the -ac tree doesn't adopt
all the ll_rw_blk/elevator changes from the vanilla tree.

You'll see this on other things too. Large file creates seem to basically
stall anything wanting swap

Fairness, throughput, latency - pick any two..

Curious - what do you think the right fix is ?
