IMHO we shouldn't add another config option.
Just correctly set UTS_MACHINE in arch/x86/Makefile will do it.
I wasn't aware where the machine name came from.
Now that I know that (and shamelessly copying ideas from s390;-)
it is easy to fix. See attached patch.
Testing a crosscompiled 32-bit-kernel I now get
    # uname -m
    i686
on my K7.
Other tests will follow. But patch looks sane and should go mainline asap, I think.
Regards,
Andreas
