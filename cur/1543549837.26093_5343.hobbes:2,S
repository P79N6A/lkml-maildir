Temporary variables shouldn't be needed...  We need to put
drivers/md in both SUB_DIRS and MOD_SUB_DIRS if lvm=Y and md=M (or vice
versa), so it sounds like something like this would work:
	if (config_md==y || config_lvm=y)
		sub_dirs += drivers/md
	if (config_md==m || config_lvm==m)
		mod_sub_dirs += drivers/md
