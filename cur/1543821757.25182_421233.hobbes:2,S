I thought that this had been fixed:
ia64 now has a "printk_clock()" defined in arch/ia64/kernel/time.c
which overrides the "weak" symbol defined in kernel/printk.c.  This
calls ia64_printk_clock() ... which defaults to a jiffie based
routine, but might be an ITC based routine if running on a system
where the clocks do not drift on different cpus.  Platform code
can also override this function pointer (which SGI does in their
sn_setup() routine).
The ITC based routine still uses sched_clock(), but tries to avoid
the original problems by not calling sched_clock() until the MMU
has been set up to map the per-cpu areas (checks whether one of the
AR.K registers has been set).  Most of this in commit:

Do you still see a problem on some platform?
