I got a little further with the lock up problem, and it is related to 
MPS reporting a 2nd processor being present in some PPro systems 
when in fact only one CPU is really installed (but MPS is reporting default
table entry 6 with a second CPU as present).  What seems to be different
here is that on this system, NT and NetWare both timeout on attempts 
to activate the non-existent CPU, while 2.4 hard hangs after sending 
a STARTUP_IPI command.  hpa does some work on the APIC code I've noticed,
so I thought I'd ask him about it.
