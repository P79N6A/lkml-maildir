That's *precisely* the point I tried to make. .desktop files are just
plain text files, as far as Unix is concerned. They do not map neatly
to Windows .lnk files because the kernel's file system layer does
not handle them specially, as it does symlinks. God and Bill Gates
alone know how Windows handles .lnk files, but it does seem that Windows
imputes to them special semantics, rather like a shell script.

Again, that was my point, which I rather muddled. I was coming at it from 
the other direction, though. Windows doesn't handle .lnks as the Unix kernel
handles symlinks, true, but the kernel doesn't handle .desktop files as
Windows handles .lnks, either.

Quite so: the kernel sees .desktop and sees a plain old file; Windows sees
.lnk and does something that resembles interpreting them. Again, my point
was that .desktop files do not map cleanly .lnk files.
As for who "wins" in this thread, I could care less because I don't need
or want to display Windows shortcuts.
