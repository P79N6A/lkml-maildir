From the Home Office in Wahoo, Nebraska:
The Top Ten ways to get your [PATCH] blown off.
   10. Mispronounce Linus, Linus.
    9. Spell it [PITCH] - this is SG meets IDE.  We can package it
       for the script kiddies, cast a Steven Seagal. I'm thinking
       nothing but net.  Come on, if you aren't going to greenlight
       this I have a meeting with Jordan at two.
    8. Mention your software patent application in the comments.
    7. Say that when you grow up, you want to be just like Alan.
    6. Three words: thread private mappings.
    5. Babelfish it into French so you sound really cool.
    4. Refer to yourself in the third person.
    3. Subject: Home Loans & Financing Available.
    2. Post it to Slashdot.
    1. Post it to linux-kernel.
