I'd just like to point out how very broken your mail server has to be 
before ending up dropped from the list.  I've been dropped three times 
that I can think of off the top of my head.  Two were multi day outages of 
my mail server and one was a serious misconfig that caused everything to 
bounce for sereral hours.
Someone needs to suck it up and fix his mail server.
