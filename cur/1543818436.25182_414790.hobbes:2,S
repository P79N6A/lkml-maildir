# grep -r ah._delay.[A-Z] .
./aic7xxx_core.c:       ahc_delay(AHC_BUSRESET_DELAY);
./aic79xx_core.c:       ahd_delay(AHD_BUSRESET_DELAY);
./aic79xx_core.c:       ahd_delay(AHD_BUSRESET_DELAY);
I am not sure that this constant won't be redefined to something large.
If maintainer knows better, he can take care of it.
I just fixed an obvious latent bug.
