I have a little trouble reading your assembly code, but your
return_from_int() function should normally not call
schedule_and_signal_from_int() when the interrupt happened
in kernel context (like in the idle function):
+	/* if not return to user mode, get out */
+	p2.l = lo(IPEND);
+	p2.h = hi(IPEND);
+	r0 = [p2];
+	r1 = 0x17(Z);
+	r2 = ~r1;
+	r2.h = 0;
+	r0 = r2 & r0;
+	r1 = 1;
+	r1 = r0 - r1;
+	r2 = r0 & r1;
+	cc = r2 == 0;
+	if !cc jump 2f;
This looks a lot like you user_mode() function, so you jump
over schedule_and_signal_from_int() here.
What you described would be a preemptive kernel
(CONFIG_PREEMPT), but you clearly don't have that enabled.
