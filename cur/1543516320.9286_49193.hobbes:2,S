Hi,
If you thought 2.3.28 is perfect here is the list of known (to me) bugs.
1. Memory sizing does not work on Compaq Proliant 1600. Workaround: use
"mem=" option to set manually. Failure to do so will result in filesystems
corruption (and other bad things) within a few minutes of normal
day-to-day activity (compiling the kernel).
2. ramdisk is broken (i.e. doesn't work at all - all data returned is
zeroed). Probably due to some changes in buffer/page caches. I have more
info on this but it is still not fixed.
3. Running lilo on some (large) disks results in
ll_rw_block: device 08:00: only 1024-char blocks implemented (4096)
Workaround: use "linear" option in /etc/lilo.conf.
4. zeropage corrupted on boot (try to pass a command_line[] longer than a
few bytes and see for yourself. Workaround: don't use such a long
command_line[], if necessary change the kernel sources for defaults you
prefer.
5. binfmt link ordering is not optimal. Niels Kristian Bech Jensen sent me
a patch which I tested and found to work fine. I put a copy on:

I hope Linus will accept it.
That's all for now :)
