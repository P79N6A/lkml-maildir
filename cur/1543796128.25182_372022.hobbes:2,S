rmk, also a native English speaker, agrees with Ray, Thomas and Ingo.
As does dictionary.reference.com's definitions of timeout and timer:
 timeout
  A period of time after which an error condition is raised if some event
  has not occured. A common example is sending a message. If the receiver
  does not acknowledge the message within some preset timeout period, a
  transmission error is assumed to have occured.
 timer
  a timepiece that measures a time interval and signals its end
Hence, timers have the implication that they are _expected_ to expire.
Timeouts have the implication that their expiry is an exceptional
condition.
So can we stop rehashing this stupid discussion?
