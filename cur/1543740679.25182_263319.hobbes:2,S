Take a loop in fs/cifs/cifsfs.c:cifs_oplock_thread() (I won't copy it
here to avoid you all going blind). It can be recoded as
    while(1) {
        spin_lock(&GlobalMid_Lock);
        while (list_empty(&GlobalOplock_Q)) {
             if (kcond_timedwait(&SomeCIFSCVAR, &GlobalMid_Lock, HZ) == -EINTR) {
                     spin_unlock(&GlobalMid_Lock);
                     complete_and_exit(&cifs_oplock_exited, 0);
             }
        }
        oplock_item = list_entry(GlobalOplock_Q.next, struct oplock_q_entry, qhead);
        /* do stuff with oplock_item ... */
        spin_unlock(&GlobalMid_Lock);
        ....
    }
Point is that this is very stylistic usage---easily recognizable.
