Well, yes.  Both "adap" and "adapter" are used to refer to the same 
thing in the file; "adap" seemed to be the most common usage so I chose 
that for the new functions I added. In one place I changed adapter to 
adap.  I also changed "res" to "result".  I can fix those.  Or I can 
submit a patch first that renames the adap and adapter to make the usage 
consistent (I would prefer adapter).

I don't see that.  The ugliest thing about this is the functions that 
take the massive numbers of parameters, but that goes away in the next 
patch which puts all the data into a single data structure and passes it 
around.  The code here was also very inconsistent about use of spaces, 
like x(a,b,c) vs x(a, b, c), "struct a *b" vs "struct a * b", "a=b" vs 
"a = b".  It's hard to know what was right.  The changes I made in these 
respects was to try to make it use the usage most common in the file.
If you like, I can do a pass and make everything consistent in the file 
as part of the previous patch I talked about.

I tried very hard not to make logic changes.  Now I see there were two 
places where the function checked client->adapter->algo->master_xfer 
then called i2c_transfer(), which did the same check and returned the 
same error if it was NULL.  I removed the redundant check.  That belongs 
in a separate patch.  I couldn't find any others.

The i2c main functions do the following:
  Format the data for transmission
  Send the data to the next layer down for handling
  Clean up the results
The original code did all this in single big functions.  This patch 
breaks the formatting and cleanup operations into separate functions.  
Beyond one big function being ugly, the non-blocking code needs this 
because it needs to perform these separately.  When you start the 
operation, the non-blocking code needs to do the format then return.  
Later on, when the operation is complete, the thread of execution 
handling the completion will do the cleanup.
