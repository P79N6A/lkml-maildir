If you have a 4M queue size, it appears as though you are trying to
use UDP where TCP should have been used. Normally, what you call the
queue size, is set to contain you largest packet you will ever want to
send. With this in mind, you don't even know if a fragmented packet
can be routed if it's more than 64k in length so you would never try
to send something larger than that under UDP.
