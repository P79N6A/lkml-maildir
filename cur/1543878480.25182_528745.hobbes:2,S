Sure.
Robin how many kernel thread per cpu are you seeing?
I don't know that we have a problem in this regard but it feels like
you are seeing a lot more kernel threads per cpu than I would expect
from looking at small systems.
I am wondering if somewhere we are using per cpu kernel threads when
we should not be...
