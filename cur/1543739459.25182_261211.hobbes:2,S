	The kernel does not have the information yet. It could get it, but it does
not have it.

	So is it your position that a kernel cannot drop a UDP packet at any time
after it indicated that the socket was readable because of that packet? If
so, please cite where in POSIX you think you find this requirement.
	The kernel elects to drop the packet on the call to 'recvmsg'. This is its
right -- it can drop a UDP packet at any time. POSIX is careful not to imply
that 'select' guarantees future behavior because this is not possible in
principle.

	Sure it would. It would break on any platform that dropped a UDP packet
after having triggered a read hit on 'select' because of that packet. POSIX
does not say that a future read will not block because it cannot guarantee
that under at least some circumstances.
