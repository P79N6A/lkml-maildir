Subject: [PATCH] Shrink struct task_struct::oomkilladj
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/12/208

oomkilladj in int, but values which can be assigned to it are -17, [-16, 15],
thus fitting into s8.
While patch itself doesn't help in making task_struct smaller, because of
natural alignment of ->link_count, it will make picture clearer wrt futher
task_struct reduction patches. My plan is to move ->fpu_counter and
->oomkilladj after ->ioprio filling hole on i386 and x86_64. But that's for
later, because bloated distro configs need looking at as well.
