Ciao Con,
i downloading right now kernel 2.6.14-rc3 and your latest patch (v15),
in the weekend I'll update my Ubuntu platform and I'll like to compare
performance of vanilla vs vm-swap_prefetch.
Any hint about what kind of instrumentation I could use in order to
get interesting and useful numbers ?
Thanks!
Regards,
