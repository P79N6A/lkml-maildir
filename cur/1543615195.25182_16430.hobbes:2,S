Each URB points to one transfer buffer, address plus length, where
the USB device drivers directly read/write those addresses.   The
requirement for drivers is that the transfer buffers can be passed to
pci_map_single() calls by the Host Controller Drivers (HCDs).  The
device drivers, and URBs, don't expose such mappings, they only
require that they can be created/destroyed.
I'd be inclined to say transfer buffers must not be "virtual" mappings,
but since terminology can differ I'll let you draw your conclusion.

Standard HC hardware (EHCI, OHCI, UHCI) can use 32bit addresses
for their PCI DMA.  EHCI can also, in some implementations, handle 64bit
addresses.

So you're saying that pci_map_page() is not necessary?  And that
highmem buffers (page+offset, or scatterlist thereof) can be turned
into the form needed by URBs using some other mechanism?
I'd certainly rather that be the case for the moment, for simplicity.
Keep in mind that usb-storage seems to be the only driver that'd
run into that issue.
