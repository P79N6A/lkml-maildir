Well, good point.  My only question would be: why are other 
"uninitialized" variables masked in the same way in that code?
Also, perhaps the phrasing in SubmittingPatches should be changed.  
Currently (for "trivial" patches) it says:
 Warning fixes (cluttering with useless warnings is bad)
Is that warning considered "useful"?  Should this hint, instead, read:
 Warning fixes (make sure the warning is "real", if not, patch gcc)
:)
