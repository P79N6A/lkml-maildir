Your email client is doing space-stuffing.  It's easy enough to fix at this
end, but even easier if you fix it ;)

I worry a bit about doing _anything_ extra at oops-time.  It just decreases
the chances of the kernel generating the info which we want.
So...  Please consider abandoning the notifier-chain and just go for a
simple function call.
If people want to add extra goodies later on, well, they need to patch the
kernel anyway so they can patch your newly-added function rather than
hooking into the notifier chain.

That export isn't needed.

Again, a deref of current->nsproxy->uts_ns->name at oops-time has risks.
This string could be precalculated, no?

module_init() is a bit more modern, but equivalent.

do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime() takes xtime_lock.  So if the kernel
oopses while holding xtime_lock we don't get to see the oops.  This is bad.
I don't know what to do here.  It will be hard to find a read-the-time
function which is a) lockless and b) available on all architectures and
configs.
If you can find a way to use plain old jiffies, that'd be good.
