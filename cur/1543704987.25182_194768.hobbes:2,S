I'm sure you don't mean to rely on it being 4 or 6: it just depends
on where in the init sequence init_tmpfs gets called, who else has
already allocated anon supers before it.

I can't think of a better way.  I presume you're focussing on that
minor number because you don't want to be fooled by an mmap of a
regular file at root named /SYSVnnnnnnnn.  Beware that a shared
writable mmap of /dev/zero (or MAP_ANONYMOUS) also appears on
that major:minor, but named /dev/zero (deleted).
You might prefer to identify the minor number that way, via an
mmap(0, 1, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0),
I can't see any reason for their minors to diverge (so long as
minors make any sense at all here).
