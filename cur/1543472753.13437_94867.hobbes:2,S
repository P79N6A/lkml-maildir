No, your butt would be hauled into court for breaking your license
agreement, regardless of what you called it. Then they might sue you for
using their trademark if you still had some cash left.

Ummm, that's not changing the name of their product. You've just made a
new product. You've done nothing to the name of their product.

So by this argument, "Redhat Linux" should be known as "Redhat for Linux",
right? There is no difference, except perhaps "Redhat Linux" sounds like
they made Linux, whereas the slash in "GNU/Linux" makes it more clear they
are two seperate entities.

Ummm, that's why it's not called "GNU's Linux". Perhaps your mailer
confuses "/" with "'s"? You should have it seen to. :)
So now we have "Redhat with GNU and Linux and some BSD stuff, and Apache, 
and the GIMP, and netscape, and a thousand other little progs that don't
fall into any of those categories, pickles onions on a sesame seed bun and
a partridge in a pear tree (V 5.2)".
Hmmm, bit of a mouthful. I can see why they trimmed it down to "Redhat
Linux". Of course, since the chances are there is more GNU code in there
than Redhat-written code and kernel code put together (IANAStatistician:)
I can also understand why Debian call their system Debian GNU/Linux.
