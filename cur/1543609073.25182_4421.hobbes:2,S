That's a kernel daemon called kupdated. Under Linux buffers are flushed
every 5 seconds (I don't like this myself, it should be triggered by
something dependant on free mem, dirty buffers, disk access, etc. but
not time, this doesn't scale.
Under 2.2 you can try the noflushd package - perhaps it works on 2.4, I
haven't tried. It works more or less.
