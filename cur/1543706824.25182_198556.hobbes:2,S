This sounds like an interesting idea.  I'll take a look and see if
I can give it a try.
BTW, the 2.6.3-rc2-mm1 __block_write_full_page() almost already did
your option c) except for the "if (buffer_dirty())".  If the
buffer is in flight buffer_dirty would already be cleared, so
it would not call __set_page_dirty_nobuffers().
                if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE) {
                        lock_buffer(bh);
                } else {
                        if (test_set_buffer_locked(bh)) {
                                if (buffer_dirty(bh))
                                        __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(page);
                                continue;
                        }
                }
Thanks,
Daniel
