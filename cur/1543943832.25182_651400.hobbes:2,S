My bad, sorry for not looking carefully. Assuming a refactoring is not desired for just a compiler warning, is following acceptable (this kind of plain messages seems heavily used in vmt.c, so i'm again assuming its OK to use such style)?
commit 801c135ce73d5df1caf3eca35b66a10824ae0707 (UBI: Unsorted Block Images) introduced the warning
drivers/mtd/ubi/vmt.c: In function `ubi_create_volume':
drivers/mtd/ubi/vmt.c:379: warning: statement with no effect
