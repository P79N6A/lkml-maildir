git has an extremely effective diffing mechanism. You may surprised at
how little it adds.
For example, git compressed the 2.6GB mozilla cvs tree down to 400MB.
I used to clone trees all the time, but now I'm much better at using
git and I haven't cloned a complete tree from kernel.org in a year.
git remote is a cool feature.
