  Ahh.. I see.

  Hmmm.. but, currently
* PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK == (~(PAGE_SIZE-1)&(__PHYSICAL_MASK << PAGE_SHIFT)
	== (0xffffffff_fffff000 & (0x00003fff_ffffffff << 12)
  	== 0x03ffffff_fffff000
  while it actually should be 0x00003fff_fffff000
* PTE_FILE_MAX_BITS == __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT == 46, but only 40bits are 
available in page table entries.
