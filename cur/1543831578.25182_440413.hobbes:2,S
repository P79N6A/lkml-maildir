Indeed, it *interferes* with it: in the original code, process doing
direct reclaim during balance_dirty_pages()
    generic_file_write()->balance_dirty_pages()->...->__alloc_pages()->...->pageout()
performs page-out even if queue is congested. Intent of this is to
throttle writers, and reduce risk of running oom (certain file systems,
especially ones with delayed allocation, tend to allocate a lot of
memory in balance_dirty_pages()->writepages() paths).
Your patch breaks this mechanism.
Nikita.
