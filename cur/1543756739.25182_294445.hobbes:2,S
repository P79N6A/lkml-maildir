This is interesting.  I always used agpgart without a second thought (2.4.29, 
GeForce4 MX with Via KT133 chipset).
I just read through the nVidia readme file, and there is a comprehensive 
section on what module to use for what chipset (and card).  It recommends 
using the nVagp for my setup, so I just rebuilt excluding agpgart so I can 
use the nVdia module.
I never had slowness as such in KDE or X apps, but playing quake2 openGL I 
used to get a 'wave' type effect rippling down the screen occasionally.  A 
quick test using the nVagp module to have fixed that...
I will test for a few weeks.
