Subject: IDE DMA under 2.4?

i've noticed that i can't seem to enable DMA on my IDE disk under
2.4.2-ac18.  this works under 2.2.19pre14 (the last 2.2 kernel i
built).  i've been slogging through lk archives but can't seem to find
where this got changed.
when i do 'hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda', i get
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
my controller is a PIIX4, the disk is an IBM DJSA-220 (2.5" laptop
drive, 20GB).
is there any way to reenable DMA on this disk?  according to 'hdparm
-t -T' while booted single-user, i get about 6MB/s without DMA (under
2.4), and about 17MB/s with (under 2.2).
tia, and sorry if it's a faq i couldn't dig up,
ian
