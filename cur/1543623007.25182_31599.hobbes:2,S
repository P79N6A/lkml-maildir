Later versions, including the current 2.4.18 fail, to mount an initrd.
Since I use the same kernel for everything (very small), with different
modules as different machines may require, I need a working initrd.
This machine, and several others, require SCSI modules to be installed
before the final root file-system is accessible. The last kernels I've
tried, 2.2.17 and 2.2.18 find a compressed file-system for initrd, then
promptly free it. I end up with a panic can't mount root on 1:0. This
is /dev/ram0. I have tried /dev/ram1 (1:1) as well. The kernel recognizes
what file-system it should mount, but doesn't. This has been reported
on LK several times over the past year. I even provided a script that
any interested person can execute to make an 'initrd floppy' to verify
that a root file-system can be found and mounted. The only responses
I got were things like; "You should use cramfs". I need an ext2
file-system on the RAM Disk. I guess there's no longer any interest
in that amongst kernel developers. 
Once somebody makes a kernel they has both a working loop device and
a working initial RAM Disk, I will use that kernel. In the meantime,
I'm stuck at 2.4.1.
Cheers,
