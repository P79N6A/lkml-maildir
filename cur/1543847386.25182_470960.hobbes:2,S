One possibility is to do that with symbol_request() and friends. That
would not be pretty though, imho.
DVB subsystem uses that currently to load frontend modules dynamically,
see dvb_attach() and dvb_frontend_detach() in
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.h and
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c.
