And if you ever wonder from where the "epoll" name came, it came from the 
old /dev/epoll. The epoll predecessor /dev/epoll, was adding plugs 
everywhere events where needed and was delivering those events in O(1) 
*directly* on a user visible (mmap'd) buffer, in a zero-copy fashion.
The old /dev/epoll was faster the the current epoll, but the latter was 
chosen because despite being sloghtly slower, it had support for every 
pollable device, *without* adding more plugs into the existing code.
Performance and code maintainance are not to be taken disjointly whenever 
you evaluate a solution. That's the reason I got excited about this new 
generic AIO slution.
