hm, I guess you test both UNEVICTABLE_LRU on/off and this problem 
happend only if CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU=y, right?
if so, I really wonder this result.
above mean the page have both following two condition.
 - vma of the page have VM_LOCKED flag.
 - pte of the page is NOT present
I can't imazine how to reproduce it.
Could you please tell me how to reproduce? (sorry, I don't know xen at all)
and, Can you post your bunch of WARN_ON list and .config?
