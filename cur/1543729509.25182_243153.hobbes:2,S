#   kbuild: Fix parallel build in a distclean'ed tree
#   
#   Fixes the following error:
#   make: *** No rule to make target `.tmp_kallsyms2.S', needed by `.tmp_kallsyms2.o'.
#   
#   Problem is that make does not know it have to visit scripts before it can use $(KALLSYMS)
#   $(KALLSYMS) is a dependency to .tmp_kallsyms% but make suddenly complains about
#   .tmp_kallsyms2 for some reasons.
