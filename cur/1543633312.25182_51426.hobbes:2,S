And user space should gradually be fixed from using them.  In almost
every case there are more appropriate headers to use.  Basically
keeping the /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm  directories is a
crutch to allow a slow user space transition.
Actually by now most applications have been fixed and do not use
them.  The policy has been in place for several years now.
