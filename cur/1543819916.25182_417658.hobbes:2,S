Hi Maurice.
Didn't you report this bug already to bugzilla.netfilter.org (and maybe
eben to the bugme.osdl.org)?  Reporting a bug in three distinct places,
even though it has been replied to at one place is not really going to
use developer resources efficiently, don't you think?

It probably was since 2.6.16 then, that was when the x_tables patches
were merged, the code most likely to have affected any such
incompatibility of the binary interface.  It was tested thoroughlt,
especially on x86_64, whihc is my main development platform.
However, your problem seems to be something different.  I suspect that
all rules with '-p tcp' or '-p udp' don't work, whereas others do.  You
seem to be missing the xt_tcpudp.ko module, which implements that
feature in 2.6.17-rcX kernels.
