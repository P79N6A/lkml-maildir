i've uploaded a new version of the preempt-timing patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/preempt-timing-on-2.6.8-rc3-O4.patch
this patch fixes a number of false positives and false negatives. In
particular it fixes the idle-task false positives, and it now correctly
measures preemption delays in softirq and hardirq contexts and in
bh-disabled process contexts. Maybe this sheds a light on some of the
more mysterious delays that we've seen. (and which were never directly
measured before.)
(the patch also got alot simpler, which should help portability.)
