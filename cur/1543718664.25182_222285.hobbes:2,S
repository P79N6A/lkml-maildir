My FreeBSD server acts as a gateway. On one side, there is my laptop,
and on the other side, I've a DSL access with a download throughput
which reach usually the 4-5Mb/s
When I download with my laptop from Internet, the flow pass thru my
gateway and I can reach the limit (with a good ftp server...). But when
I directly download from my own server, it's slower than to download
from Internet...
