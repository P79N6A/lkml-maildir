Those hangs and unkillability are just the consequence of the BUG
happening in an awkward place, I think.  Though that would be more
on an SMP system, which yours is not.  The stack backtrace naturally
contains stale addresses from before, it's hard to work out whether
there's actually something further wrong after the BUG_ON or not.

I'm not sure.  There _used_ to be a bug which caused this, but Rajesh
fixed that in 2.6.10, and the fix looks like it's still there in 2.6.14.
And it needed something a lot more complex than "grep" to trigger it.
My guess at this point is that it's a hardware problem i.e. bad memory,
cpu overheating, that kind of thing.  (The BUG_ON is surprised to find
vm_pgoffs in ecx: 0000010f edx: 00000110 different: not a single-bit
error, but perhaps it could arise from a single-bit error nearby.)
Please give memtest86 an overnight run (though finding nothing won't
prove your memory okay), and be on the lookout for other strange
behaviour on this machine.  If the next strange thing that happens is
another BUG at mm/prio_tree.c:78! that will suggest a kernel bug here.
