I can't see how it will be a problem.  It's not like a buffer_head: the
struct page is static, so the wait queue and the flags will certainly be
valid even after page reuse.  The page locked flag is only set during
IO, so we guarantee that if a page becomes locked, it will become
unlocked some time in the future and will deliver a wakeup to the page
at that point.
It doesn't matter if we end up waiting for the wrong page by mistake: as
long as we don't expect the same page to be there on wakeup, we should
be fine.  In truncate_inode_pages(), we do 
			if (PageLocked(page)) {
				wait_on_page(page);
				goto repeat;
			}
which looks safe enough from this respect.

We can't rely on the page being used for this inode, but we can rely on
the struct page being there, and I think that is all that counts here.
