Congrats ;-)

There seem to be a questionable part of it (didn't see this part
on linux-kernel, why?).

IIRC variables marked as "__initdata" need to be explicitly set
even to zero, because gcc won't put them into the right section
otherwise. One of Tigran's patches has been reverted because of
this.
So please reconsider this chunk and prove me wrong if I'm ;-)
PS: Same goes for several other chunks in the submitted
   ISDN-Patch. 
PPS: No, this is not fixed in pre3.
