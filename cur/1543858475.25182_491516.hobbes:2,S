I can probably speak for Ubuntu in saying we wont include any sort of
patch like this unless it's forced on us.
I have to agree with your your whole statement. The gradual changes to
lock down kernel modules to a particular license(s) tends to mirror the
slow lock down of content (music/movies) that people complain about so
loudly. It's basically becoming DRM for code.
I don't think anyone ever expected technical mechanisms to be developed
to enforce the GPL. It's sort of counter intuitive to why the GPL
exists, which is to free the code.
Let the licenses and lawyers fight to protect the code. The code doesn't
need to do that itself. It's got better things to do.
