yeah, i suspected something like that - the PREEMPT_RT latency numbers 
were so out of whack with anything i've measured on similar boxes. The 
debugging features on PREEMPT_RT are powerful but have a high overhead.
could you send me your PREEMPT_RT .config? (whichever version you have 
handy) That's the easiest way i can tell you which options to watch out 
for.
