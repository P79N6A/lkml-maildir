I have a practical suggestion. Most recent disk drives have a new type of 
self-test option called 'selective self-tests'.  This allows you to run a 
self-test on up to five user-defined ranges of LBAs.  For example, if you 
suspect that LBA=12345678 is failing, then instead of having to wait an 
hour or two for the entire disk surface to be scanned, you can tell the 
disk to scan (say) the range LBA_1=12345000 to LBA_2=12345999 five times 
in a row, which takes only a few seconds.  By repeating this process many 
times you can scan a trouble area on the disk a few thousands of times in 
an hour.
For a couple of years, smartmontools smartctl has had the functionality to 
invoke these selective self-tests if the disk supports them.  But (until 
just last week) it was awkward: it required a kernel built with TASKFILE 
support enabled, and only worked with (some of the) ide drivers. This has 
changed. Thanks to hard work by Doug Gilbert and Jeff Garzik to built a 
SAT (SCSI to ATA Translation) layer in libata and to put a SAT interface 
into smartmontools, anyone can easily access this functionality with any 
SATA disk that supports selective self-test via libata.
Note: no smartmontools release incorporates this yet.  You have to build 
from CVS.  Here are the instructions (4 lines):
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@smartmontools.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smartmontools login (when prompted for a password, just press Enter)
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@smartmontools.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smartmontools co sm5
cd sm5
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
Here is an example of running a selective self-test five times on the 
same range of LBAs as above:
[slave0123 ~]# ./smartctl -d sat -t select,12345000-12345999 -t select,12345000-12345999 -t select,12345000-12345999 -t select,12345000-12345999 -t select,12345000-12345999 /dev/sda

Justin, I hope that this is of some help to you and others with similar 
issues.
