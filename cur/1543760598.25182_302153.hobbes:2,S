Didn't you start this thread by pointing out that SuSE has a gcc 3.3.4
which isn't?  I would call that a compiler which lies about its version, and
for the purposes of this argument, I would say that it is not a sane
compiler.
Given this, your original (correct) claim was that my patch would not help
such compilers.  Are you now claiming that it does help such compilers, and
no one else?
