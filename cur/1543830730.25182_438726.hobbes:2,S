Yes, it is a problem and we may have to do something approximate like 
counting ticks for sys time and subtracting that from the total to get 
user time when reporting the times to user space (only a bit more 
complex to make sure we don't end up with negative times).
How is it intended to handle this problem in the tickless kernel?
Peter
PS It's all moot until sched_clock() is fixed anyway.
PPS Recent kernels (-mm ones at least) keep a sched_time in nsecs for 
each task but I've no idea what it's used for.
