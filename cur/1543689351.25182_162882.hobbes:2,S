	So are you arguing that I can distribute a derived work from the Linux
kernel and attach a 'you may not use this unless you pay me $100' clause and
it would be enforceable?

	If you are right, you've discovered a serious fundamental flaw in the GPL.
I can distribute code under the GPL and prohibit anyone from using derived
works, hence effectively removing their freedom to modify.

	Then you have no right to usage. The preamble contradicts this, but I doubt
it's binding.

	This is only about works that you distribute or publish. We're talking
about using modules.

	Yes, but nobody's arguing that these are license enforcement schemes or
that this is a license restriction. Nobody would complain if you removed
those restrictions. The question here is whether the GPL_ONLY stuff is a
copyright enforcement mechanism or license restriction. If we agree it's not
and anyone is free to circumvent or remove it, then there's nothing to
dispute.

	Copyright enforcement schemes can also restrict usage. Access cards for
satellite TV are purely usage restriction devices.

	I'd agree with that.

	The law has a somewhat incomprehensible definition of what consitutes such
a scheme. I don't think anybody really knows what things would be considered
copyright enforcement schemes and what would not.
	Your argument that the GPL does not grant usage rights is troubling. If
it's correct, then I have no right to use the Linux kernel, since the
copyright holders never granted it to me!
