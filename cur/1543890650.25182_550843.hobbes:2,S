With an oops you can at least recover the system and actually 
look at the problem. On a machine with a panic you're just dead
and the probability of actually being able to do something about the problem
is much lower. On x86 systems you typically don't even get 
any message out.
And I'm not convinced drivers are in a good position to decide
if memory was likely corrupted or not anyways. At least the
panics I see in driver sources seem to be just random logic
bugs from someone not familiar with BUG().
Also they typically don't make much attempt to figure out
if there might have been data corruption.
If you're really worried about memory corruption in drivers
you should just use an IOMMU.

So you're always setting panic_on_oops?
