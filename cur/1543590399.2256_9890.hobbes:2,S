My whole point for not using PAGE_CACHE_SIZE as virtual blocksize is
that many architectures have a PAGE_CACHE_SIZE > 4k, up to 64k, on
x86-64 we may even hack a 2M PAGE_SIZE/PAGE_CACHE_SIZE mode for the
multi giga boxes. I think you agreed I'd better stay to a virtual
blocksize of 4k fixed for now.
