So you found a nasty bug in the Linux kernel :-(
The official behavior for SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE is:
1)	You call SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE with whatever size val you like
2)	It says "thank you" and _always_ returns success
3)	You call SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE to read the value set up
	in the kernel. This value is not directly related to the value
	used with SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE. The proposal from Douglas
	Gilbert was to always use 512 KB. I am unhappy with this behavior
	but I have to take it as it has been defined by the Author :-(
	He told me that the value returned with SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE
	is the value available for DMA and may be much smaller than
	the size used with SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE.
AGAIN: I am unhappy with this behavior but this _is_ the official behavior.
If the current Linux kernel for some reasons does not behave this way it
is broken and needs to be fixed.
