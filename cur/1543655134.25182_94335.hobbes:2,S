Erm... I have no problem with the macros that James's proposal would
use to take away this branch - I would expect to use exactly the same
ones.  It's just the notion of "try to get consistent memory, but get
me any old memory otherwise" that I'm not so convinced by.
In any case, on platforms where the dma_malloc() could really return
either consistent or non-consistent memory, James's sync macros would
have to have an equivalent branch within.

Hmm... fair enough.  Ok, I can see the point of a fall back to
non-consistent approach given that.  So I guess the idea makes sense,
so long as dma_malloc() (without the consistent flag) is taken to be
"give me DMAable memory, consistent or not, whichever is cheaper for
this platform" rather than "give me DMAable memory, consistent if
possible".  It was originally presented as the latter which misled me.
I think the change to the parameters which I suggested in a reply to
James makes this a bit clearer.
