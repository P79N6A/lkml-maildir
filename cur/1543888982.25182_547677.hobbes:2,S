Subject: Enabling power states for Core 2 Duo

For some reason I'm not able to enable processor power states (c1, c2 etc.) 
for my Core 2 Duo. This is what I get::
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU1/info
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 1
bus mastering control:   no
power management:        no
throttling control:      no
limit interface:         no
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU1/power
active state:            C0
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
maximum allowed latency: 2000 usec
states:
"dmesg | grep -i power" also gives nothing. I have ACPI enabled in BIOS and 
in kernel I have these set ("grep -i acpi .config | grep =y"):
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=y
CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL=y
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ=y
CONFIG_PNPACPI=y
CONFIG_SATA_ACPI=y
I'm probably missing something crucial here. So how do I enable power 
states? I'm using 64-bit Gentoo. My mobo is Asus P5B Deluxe. Otherwise ACPI 
works fine.
