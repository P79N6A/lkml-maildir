True but I'm wrestling with one of its design flaws...  it doesn't 
provide the taskfile protocol.
I really really want to know before the command is submitted whether I 
am going to be receiving data, sending data, or neither.  The current 
IDE driver "guesses" by virtue of DRQ flag behavior, but such a guess is 
impossible on modern SATA controllers.
You either have to provide a lookup table (command opcode -> protocol), 
or specify it through the userland API.  HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE does this 
via 'data_phase'.
On a more general note, though, I certainly welcome libata patches from 
any and all sources.  Hack away!
