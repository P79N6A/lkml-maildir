The current /proc/sys/cpu/ sysctls have been added as part of
Russell's cpu frequency scaling work. Currently, only the ARM
specific bits are merged. There are generic bits and x86 bits
waiting to be merged at some point..
The x86 part of this work uses the same framework, and was
done by myself and Arjan van de Ven. It's almost in a state
ready for merging also.
If you're interested in looking at this, it's in cvs..
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot login
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot checkout

This one looks most sensible to me, and fits in with the
current scheme nicely.

Dave.
