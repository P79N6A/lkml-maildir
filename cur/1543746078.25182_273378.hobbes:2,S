You're scaring me, Nikita.  Those loops in mm/swap.c are easy to follow,
whyever do you want to obfuscate them with your own macro maze?
Ingenious for_each macros make sense where it's an idiom which is going
to be useful to many across the tree; but these are just a few instances
in a single source file.
Please find a better outlet for your talents!
