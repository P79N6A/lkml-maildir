OK, but we're only holding the rwsem across filemap_fdatawrite().  What
happens after we've dropped the rwsem and we are running
filemap_fdatawait()?  Cannot kupdate come in and start moving pages onto
the wrong address_space lists while filemap_fdatawait() is trying to wait
on them?
I think so.  Possibly your test just doesn't cover this case.
If so then we need to hold the rwsem for writing across the entire
write-and-wait.  And that is going to rather suck if and when we bring back
the sync_page_range() patch, which permitted concurrent fsync() against
different fd's which cover different parts of the file.
We need to check that we're bypassing all this stuff for access to
blockdevs too - we have no security issues to worry about there.
