Looks like it. But it also has to be fast (see include/asm-i386/mmzone.h) 
and doesn't even hide the holes in NUMA machines. 
We had a page_is_ram() for this somewhere. I don't know, why this is
gone. It would be useful in other places as well.
If the page_is_ram() test could be done using the vma only now, this
would be even better and should be called vma_is_ram() to generalize
these corner cases (today and in the future) and make more
clear what these kind of tests want to do.
