And if you have multiple cdwriters? Then (cf. other posts) one has 
/dev/cdrecorder0 /dev/cdrecrder1, etc. To me, that's just as bad as having 
/dev/sg0 and /dev/sg1, because you don't have a clue at first sight what it 
maps to.
"ls -l"? Sure, if cdrecorder0 was a symlink, but it does not work when it's 
not (= a block device in essence then).
And I'm sure there's an analog program to "ls" to find what sg0 maps to.

And GUIs could use arbitrary names like S:I:L. Ugly, but as long as it 
works... sigh.
