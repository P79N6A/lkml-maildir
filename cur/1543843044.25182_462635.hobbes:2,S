If I add another group with a guarantee of 100MB, then its limit will
be anywhere between 100MB-800MB ?
I do not understand the guarantees being concerned part.

I was speaking in general where we have 'n' groups, so thats why I had
"everyone else".

I am not quite sure I understand this question. Let me try with an example.
Lets say I have 1GB of memory and I have guarantees of 100 and 200MB for
two groups. Lets say the total unreclaimable memory is 100MB. If I add a new
group with guarantee of 50MB, which is lower than the total amount of
total unreclaimable memory. The addition of the new group should be work
fine since we have 1GB - 100 - 100 - 200MB of memory available.
