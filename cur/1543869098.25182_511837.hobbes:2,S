The documentation suggests that its the preferred mode of operation, and
that its the default on platforms where gcc is the primary compiler.  So
the fact that it isn't for Linux suggests either an oversight or that it
is actually broken...
Do we have much assembler which cares about the struct return calling
convention?  If not, it should be a fairly easy test.
