make_page_uptodate() is most hideous part I have run into.
It has to know details about other layers to now what not
to stomp.  I think my incorrect simplification of this is what messed
things up, last round.

Cool. Triple buffering :)  Although I guess that would only
apply to metadata these days.   Having a separate store would
solve some of the problems, and probably remove the need
for carefully specifying the ramdisk block size.  We would
still need the magic restictions on page allocations though
and it we would use them more often as the initial write to the
ramdisk would not populate the pages we need.
A very ugly bit seems to be the fact that we assume we can
dereference bh->b_data without any special magic which
means the ramdisk must live in low memory on 32bit machines.
