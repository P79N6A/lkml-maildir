  Hello.
  I've done a cleanup in quota code in 2.3.29.. There were some parts from ancient
ages (like testing uid against 0, passing ttys through functions when we can get
them from 'current' and so on..).
  I'm also attaching patch which fixes testing of quotafile size and also fixes
testing whether user has rights to get some quota information. Please apply them.
							Honza.
