The HPNA looks, for all intents and purposes, as Ethernet.
The interesting question will be card drivers.
If card vendor writes a driver themselves, and sends it out
in source, we are happy.   If they give (to selected few
contact people) sufficient information for writing a driver,
that works too.
Reading the Broadcom  BCM4211 and BCM4413 product briefs
does give me an idea that the thing wont be quite simple.
That is, unless the Soft-V.90 is ditched.
(Biggest code is at that modem stuff anyway.)
Even writing a soft-modem into separate user-space entity
with only the low-level hardware driving in the kernel
is doable by letting the modem stuff to be binary-only.
For several reasons that is most likely appropriate way
even to do it.  Soft-modem has no place in kernel.
