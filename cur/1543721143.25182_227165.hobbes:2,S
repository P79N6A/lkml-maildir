What would your goal for the major rewrite be?
Redesign the implementation?
Clean up / re-factor the current design?
Add features?
I've been wondering lately if a significant restructuring of the 
implementation could be done.  Something bottom's up that enabled changing / 
using different time bases without rebooting and coexisted nicely with HPET.
Something along the lines of;
* abstracting the time base's, calibration and computation of the next 
interrupt time into a polymorphic interface along with the implementation of 
a few of your time bases (ACPI, TSC) as a stand allown patch.
* implement yet another polymorphic interface for the interrupt source used by 
the patch, along with a few interrupt sources (PIT, APIC, HPET <-- new )
* Implement a simple RTC-like charactor driver using the above for testing and 
integration.  
* Finally a patch to integrate the first 3 with the POSIX timers code.
What do you think?
