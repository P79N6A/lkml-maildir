I think you mean makedumpfile, don't you?

That sounds good. But I doubt that kernel developers like the idea of
needing another utility in the build process ...

Where do you get the info from? If you're in the kdump initrd,
then the kdump kernel is already loaded. Do you want to attach the
info from the crashed kernel to the initrd of the kdump kernel?
Thanks,
