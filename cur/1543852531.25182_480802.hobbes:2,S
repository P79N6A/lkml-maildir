Thanks all.
Arjan, using combined_mode=libata and making a new ramdisk increased my 
xfer rate from 1.xx mb/sec to 28.xx mb/sec.
I am curious as to why my friends dell inspiron 8200 with a 1.8ghz p4 
and the same drive using the same drive with FC6 and the standard ide 
module gets 44 to 45 mb/sec.
