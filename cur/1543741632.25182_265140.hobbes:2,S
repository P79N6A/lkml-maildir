Here is my current list in things that directly affect me:
sound/core/info.c contains __DATE__ to tell what date it was compiled
on, I'm not sure this is really needed.
usr/gen_init_cpio.c uses time(NULL) to set mtimes,
scripts/Makefile.lib uses gzip with no -n flag
I can supply patches to get rid of these if people think they are a
good/bad idea...
I also hack scripts/mkcompile_h so it never changes for me (this one
is acceptable as it is very obvious that you have to do it...)
Dave.
