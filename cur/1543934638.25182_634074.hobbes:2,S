Using the EDAC code in kernel.org kernel version 2.6.23.8 I am seeing the
following problem:
    In the kernel there is a pci device attribute located in sysfs that is
    checked by the EDAC PCI scanning code. If that attribute is set,
    PCI parity/error scannining is skipped for that device. The attribute
    is:
            broken_parity_status
    as is located in /sys/devices/pci<XXX>/0000:XX:YY.Z directorys for
    PCI devices.
I don't think this check was actually implemented.  I have a misbehaved card
that reports a parity error every 1000 ms:
Nov 25 07:28:43 beta kernel: EDAC PCI: Master Data Parity Error on 0000:05:01.0
Nov 25 07:28:44 beta kernel: EDAC PCI: Master Data Parity Error on 0000:05:01.0
Nov 25 07:28:45 beta kernel: EDAC PCI: Master Data Parity Error on 0000:05:01.0
Setting that card's broken_parity_status bit did not mask the error:
echo "1" > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:05:01.0/broken_parity_status
I looked through the EDAC code and did not readily see any reference to
broken_parity_status at all (which makes sense based on the behavior I am
seeing).  I applied the following patch as a proof-of-concept and now EDAC's
PCI parity error reporting behaves as documented:

Good regression find, bryan. It used to work. sigh.
I added more logic to your patch, for more coverage of the error.
