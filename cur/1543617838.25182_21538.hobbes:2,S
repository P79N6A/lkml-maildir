This is exactly what we do with our (much more modest) 600 accounts at the
Departamento de Informatica of the UTFSM (Valparaiso, Chile).

The SunOS automounter (which we used before Solaris) did this too. It was a
pain in the neck, as the "real" path to the home does show through, and you
get the same problems with scripts &c containing physical, not logical,
paths to files. Fixing the _users_ is much harder than fixing up the
configurations...
