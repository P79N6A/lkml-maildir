I get this from the "Mongo" benchmark homepage.
I suppose the behaviour with your patches is "skip_busy", right?
Block allocator options are passed with alloc=opt1:opt2:... mount
parameter, where opt1, opt2,... are:
      skip_busy:
            Try to allocate blocks in block-groups (called bitmaps in
reiserfs) that have more than 10% of blocks free first, if that fail,
allocate anywhere.
      concentrating_formatted_nodes=X:
            turned on 'border algorithm' and put this border in X% of
available space.
      old_way:
            Mimic original block allocator from 2.4.18
      displacing_new_packing_localities:
            Displace formatted nodes of directories at creation time.
Displacing is the hash from the dir_id.
      displacing_large_files:
            Takes one parameter - a blocknumber. When this blocknumber
allocated for the file, it is placed separately on disk (by default new
location is the keyed_hash from the object_id
            value. "displace_based_on_dirid" will change that.
      displace_based_on_dirid:
            When displacing files, place files that live in same directory
in the same disk area. (achieved by hashing by dir_id value of ondisk_key,
instead of object_id)
