I'll worry about that when there's an error message available that makes
sense to, is ANY use to, a first-time installer in English.

Good rule. You have the makings of a pretty fair Forth programmer.
Absolutism is bad, however. A bootloader is not user-space.  User-space
doesn't exist at boot-time. If you're not opposed to the choice, then
making the choice dependant on a bootloader loses, regardless of what you
consider "the kernel". Given that the choice is good, this is the simplest
approach, and the cost within THE kernel is trivial.
This isn't sched.c we're talking about. This is the point at which the
kernel spawns user-space. We should be joyous! Enthused! Positive! Sloppy! 
Or at least not absolutist. Look at the unholy mess the SysV init binary
is.  Expedience rules at boot time. 
No, you're right. Let's stick it in the bootloader. Along with a Forth
compiler, realtime scheduling, Plan9 device-space under #, Open Firmware 
driver translation, X....
