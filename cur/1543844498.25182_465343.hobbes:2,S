Paul,
Think about what will be available to customer through a distro. 
There are two (competing) memory controllers in the kernel. But, distro
can turn only one ON. Which in turn mean
 - there will be a debate from the two controller users/advocates with
   the distro (headache to distro) about which one to turn ON
 - one party will _not_ get what they want and hence no point in them 
   getting the feature into the mainline in the first place 
   (dissatisfaction of the users/original implementors of one solution).
So, IMHO, it is better to sort out the differences before we get things
in mainline kernel.
