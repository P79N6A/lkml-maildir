This is not an option in many cases. (eg. where a company standardizes on
something non-tulip, or due to simple financial/organizational reasons.)
What you say is the approach i see in the FreeBSD camp frequently: "use

hardware-design-wise and we dont really care about them", which elitist
attitude i strongly disagree with.
