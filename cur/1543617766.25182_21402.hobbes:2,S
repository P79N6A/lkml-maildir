Which part of "to interprete" do you not understand ?
Interpreting my text is reading it and building a
meaning for the words in your head. It doesn't mean
the text needs to be changed ... the meaning can be
different for each person reading the exact same
words.
I guess this is why politicians are very careful to
not attach any meaning at all to their words, however
I'm a programmer, not a politician ;)

I think you're reading things into my words that I
didn't want to put there.
