I've got a wierd situation with a certain chipset for agpgart.
There are a few cases where I want to be able to use the existing
pci_driver api to detect the right PCI device, and call
the relevant .probe routine. No problem there.
The problem is that in these cases, I want to be able to read
a certain register in that device, and if a bit is 0, bail out
of the .probe function with -ENODEV, and make the loading of
the module fail.
The problem is that the ENODEV in my .probe routine doesn't
propagate back down as far as pci_module_init().
Ideas ?
