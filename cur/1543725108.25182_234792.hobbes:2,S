Hello,
Regarding my caching problems mentioned some days ago, I recently tried
to contact the CCISS driver maintainers, but it seems that all the mail
addresses mentioned in the source are dead, and they did not read this
list (or all of them are on a long holiday which might as well be
possible).
Do you know any reliable way to contact them?
Thanks,
Markus
