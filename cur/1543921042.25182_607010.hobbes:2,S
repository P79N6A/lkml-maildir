No big deal.  I personally don't have a distro to maintain,
so no pain for me here.

No, it just provides a way to use the hardware when the vendor
didn't include BIOS functionality for it.
These notebooks fully support hotplug in the external ExpressCard slot
(which is the *whole point* of an external slot), and according to Dell
they work just fine with that other OS.  I don't use the "other OS" here,
but the hardware also works just fine with Linux now.
I'm guessing they just left out the BIOS functionality because
it was one of the very first machines to market with such slots,
and the BIOS wasn't mature enough.   So they rely upon more easily
updated software drivers instead.  The only gotcha is they do specify
that booting from the slot is not possible (because no BIOS support).
Cheers
