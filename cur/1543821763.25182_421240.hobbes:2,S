Unfortunately yes.  __tasklet_schedule() uses interrupt disabling
as a synchronization mechanism.  This presents a problem since by
definition, NMIs can occur even when interrupts are disabled. 
However the NMI handling code in bluesmoke has a mechanism similar to
tasklets that is intended specifically for use by NMI handlers.
