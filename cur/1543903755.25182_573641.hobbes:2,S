Hello.  hugetlb_instantiation_mutex is an extremely heavy-weight lock
whose days are numbered (hopefully).  It exists primarily to arbitrate
a race condition where n (n > 1) threads of execution race to satisfy
the same page fault for a process.  Even though only one hugetlb page
is needed, if (n) are not available, the application can receive a
bogus VM_FAULT_OOM.
Anyway, the hugetlb_instantiation_mutex approach has few friends
around here, so rather than making the code rely more heavily upon it,
perhaps you could focus you efforts on helping us remove it.
