Nit, needs a space there before the '{'.

The problem as I see it is that when we boot the system we start a
kswapd on all nodes with memory.  If the hot-add adds memory to a
pre-existing node with no memory we will not start one and we end up
with a node with memory and no kswapd.  Bad.
As kswapd_run is a no-op when a kswapd already exists this seems a safe
way to fix that.  Paul's ->zone conversion is obviously correct also.
