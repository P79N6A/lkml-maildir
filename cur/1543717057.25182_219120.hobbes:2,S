Yes, that is exactly why d_qstr was introduced. The "len" and the
storage for the name is then a single update through d_qstr.

Yes, that is indeed why we had to have d_qstr.

Repeating some of the tests under ->d_lock is worth looking at, but
we have to be carefull about performance. ISTR, there was another
issue related to calling ->d_compare() under ->d_lock. I will dig
a little bit on this, or Maneesh may remember.
