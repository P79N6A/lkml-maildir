Its a shared processor partition (meaning the partition can get
scheduled anywhere), so we throw all the cpus and memory into node 0.
This machine only has 1 cpu (2 threads) and they are both in node0:
# ls -l /sys/devices/system/node/node0/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 5 17:56 cpu0 -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 5 17:56 cpu1 -> ../../../../devices/system/cpu/cpu1
