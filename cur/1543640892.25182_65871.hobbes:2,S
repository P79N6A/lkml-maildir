    This addendum is somewhat [1] annoying, because I switched over to
    BK for _everything_ a couple of years ago and now I've got a
    moderately large body of stuff that is NOT open source (my resume,
    my dns, little proofs of concept projects that I did for people.
    I've not made one red penny off any of this [particularly since the
    economy has gone south and put me out of work for the past year.
    But I'm still not opensourcing my resume.]) that's under bitkeeper.
    If I upgrade to a bk that uses the new license, then I get to play
    the exciting game of ``break the new license and defraud my former
    employers'' [2], which is about as appealing as Linus's alternative
    approach to resolving software patent issues.
