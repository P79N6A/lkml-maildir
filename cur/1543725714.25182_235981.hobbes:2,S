Should there be some sharing with the device naming of sysfs or are
will we introduce a new one? ie sysfs uses:
devices/system/cpu/cpu0/<blah>
Would it be a better way to have a version that takes struct kobject
to enforce consistency in the device naming scheme. This also means
userspace would automatically know where to look in /sys if futher
info was needed.
Question is does it make sense to use this infrastructure without sysfs
as hald, etc require it. ie depends CONFIG_SYSFS
Perhaps a send_kmessage_kobject ?
