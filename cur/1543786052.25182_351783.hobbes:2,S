drain_array_cache_locked calls check_spinlock_acquired_node which is in 
turn insuring that interrupts are off. So no move to a different processor 
should be possible.
However, that is contradicted by __wake_up calling 
drain_array_cache_locked. The process just woke up?

Accessing arrays indexed by node number even works if the process 
continues to be executed on another node.
