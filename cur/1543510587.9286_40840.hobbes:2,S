Subject: [x86,SMP,patch] smp-2.3.18-H2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

this is the latest version of the x86 SMP/APIC/IOAPIC code:
	
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/smp-2.3.18-H2
(The main, externally visible feature of the patchset is the default-on
NMI-watchdog.)
Changes in smp-2.3.18-H2:
	- we should boot on boxes with certain default mptables now.
	(Ken-ichi Yaku, Alvaro Herrera)
	- NMI handling fixes, typo fixes
	(Maciej W. Rozycki)
	- fixed minor bug in smp_call_function(), cleaned it up, converted
	  to semaphore usage. Other cleanups.
	(me)
Changes in smp-2.3.18-F8:
	- continuing quest to make 82489DX based (and other older)
	  systems work, typo fixes and comment updates.
	(Maciej W. Rozycki)
	- 'local APIC timer interrupt interleaving', this is both a
	  fix for a potential bug, and preparation for next generation
	  per-CPU timer handling.
	(me)
	- tons of further cleanups, separated smp.c into smpboot.c and
	  smp.c, cleaned up both.
	(me)
	- potential double-write bug fixed - this might fix the booting
	  problem on those old ALR dual- and quad-Pentium boards? (if
	  anyone got one)
	(me)
	- other smaller fixes i forgot about
Changes in smp-2.3.18-B1:
	- unconditional NMI oopser. It turned out that we can do this on
	99% (maybe 100%) of x86 SMP boxes without impacting timer IRQ
	performance. See Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt.
	(me)
	- old external IOAPICs and 486-based SMP boxes should work now
	(Maciej W. Rozycki)
	- unused variable space cleanups, initialize_secondary() cleanup
	(Manfred Spraul)
	- moved all IO-APIC and IPI APIC messages to logical destination
	mode, fixed LDR initialization bug, cleaned up irq-vector space.
	(me)
	- 'timer-sync' feature, all CPUs synchronize their time stamp
	counters, errors get reported and fixed. This fixes certain
	dual-PIII boards.
	(me)
	- the 'set the destination CPU mask to 0' IOAPIC-edge trick is
	actually not valid and triggers APIC bugs. Exchanged it for an
	equivalent but safe method.
	(me)
	- 8259A init moved out of setup.S
	(Maciej W. Rozycki)
	- spurious 8259A interrupts get reported properly, APIC error
	vector exported and logged properly
	(me)
	- a 'noapic' bug fixed - fixes instability in noapic mode.
	(me)
	- we can inline ack_APIC() on P6 boxes: smaller and faster IRQ 
	code.
	(me)
	- other stuff.
reports, comments, suggestions welcome.
