Tony, thanks for picking this up. I like how you keep the semantics of 
next_timer_interrupt intact. As you've mentioned in your comments we should 
move the users of that function to nanosecond timers, and it would be nice to 
use a different function name so there's no confusion (suggest 
next_hrtimer_interrupt).
Cheers,
Con
