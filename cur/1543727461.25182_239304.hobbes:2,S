After the single frame message it completes the CD rip without any other 
timeouts.  I can't tell if single frame mode impairs the speed, because 
sound-juicer doesn't rip at full CD speed anyway.  The DMA timeout 
usually happens in the first few tracks (it's nondeterministic even on 
the same CD).  The only annoying issue left is that the initial ATAPI 
reset freezes the system for a few seconds until it completes.
I don't know if you're interested, but the DMA timeout only happens in 
certain usage patterns.  If you grab the data one frame at a time with 
pauses in between (for example linking an ogg encoder directly to the 
data stream) it will trigger the DMA timeout.  If you rip the CD at full 
  drive speed (like ripping to WAV) or batch the read requests together, 
it doesn't have any problems.  Also, if you slow the max speed of the 
drive down with 'hdparm -E' so that the drive is operating at max 
(because it's now slower than the encoder) it works fine.
This is all on a JLMS XJ-HD163D DVD drive on the latest firmware.
Thanks,
