Perhaps this is just unnecessary complexity.  After all,

... this looks like exactly the right way to do things.  Very nice.
Short of booting the kernel off the network it looks like the most
robust way of doing things right.  It is not hard to reserve a small
raid-1 partition for /boot even if the rest of your system is
raid-<something-bigger-than-one>.
