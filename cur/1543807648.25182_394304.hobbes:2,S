Yes, that's right.

Well, we are writing it out because it has expired in the first place,
right? And it remains expired until we actually clean it, so I
don't see any need for a check such as this....

Agreed. That's why i proposed the s_more_io queue - it works on those inodes
that need more work only after all the other inodes have been written out.
That prevents starvation, and makes large inode flushes background work (i.e.
occur when there is nothing else to do). it will get much better disk
utilisation than the method I originally proposed, as well, because it'll keep
the disk near congestion levels until the data is written out...
Cheers,
Dave.
