The hint is in the original report:
Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 500013666 ns)
That means, that the TSC was counting, but HPET not. So it looks like
the HPET readout is stale. Which explains, why after switching to HPET
clocksource the time system gets hosed.
I wonder why the HPET counter works check did not catch this.
Can you please apply the path below and provide the output ?
Thanks,
