I run the same configuration here but UP, with quite a bit of I/O, box 
NFS exports a large build directory to 2 other boxes plus usually has 2 
builds going locally as well as being used as a storage area for 
creating isos/burning cds. VM load is medium for a 512mem/512swap box, 
~140 processes and ~150megs into swap.
