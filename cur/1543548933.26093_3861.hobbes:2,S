I do realize it is machine type dependant... I am not familiar with the
binary type dependancies--can someone point me to
information/explaination about that?
The virtual memory mapping looks like it is (or maybe can be?)
generalized in terms of kernel constants (#defines).  My knowledge is
based on your arm-linux, let me know if things are different for other
archs or if I just got something plain wrong...
0 to TASK_SIZE is user process memory space (with the 0 page accesses
trapped or something...)
PAGE_OFFSET is the start of physical memory, with memory_start to
memory_end being what's left after the kernel takes what it wants.
VMALLOC_START to VMALLOC_END is the memory space reserved for ioremapped
addresses
(On the ARM, that still leaves a blank above e0000000... what's up
there?)
These #defines seem to appear in most/all architectures, just with
different values.  What of the above is bogus?  Where can I get a more
accurate and complete understanding of this?
C-ya,
Eli
