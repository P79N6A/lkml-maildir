Dear all,
I guess I'm severe need of a 100BaseTX NIC with polling support in the
driver.
A special application requires processing of 40,000 packets/second or
more, and the interrupt load currently kills the machine (i.e. no
scheduling during peak load).
Any suggestions which card I should use?  The driver has to be open
source, and the card shouldn't be too expensive (i.e. in the usual
price range of brand 100BaseTX NICs).
Thanks,
