Remember that if you go for a full user-space driver, you have to
duplicate the kernel's tty layer to emulate everything.  For full
compatibility, that means emulating all the ancient serial and tty
ioctls properly including Linux-specific ones, SYSV-style ones,
BSD-style ones etc.
That's already been done _and_ tested in the kernel over the years.
While repeating that in user space is possible, I suspect that a pty/tty
interface would end up providing better compatibility (in practice) for
all the different, special and ancient terminal programs.  In the cases
where pty/tty doesn't relay enough information to the pty side, we
should look at whether minor changes to the pty driver can fix that.
cheers,
