at the moment yes but I'm think we will have to remove this as soon as
we get the Sparc ffb stuff up and running again, the ffb driver
doesn't do any PCI stuff, we have some code around but we haven't had
any testing done on it and I'm sure its rotting away, if a maintainer
turns up for sparc ffb, then the PCI requirement is gone..
If Christoph is correct I'll clean it up to use the construct he
suggests, no-one came up with that solution when this was asked
originally a few kernels back..
I can add the PCI dependency for now...
Dave.
