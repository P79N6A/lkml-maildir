That's the point.  This is explicitly guaranteed with the current
locks, and you are allowed to recurse on them.  The netfilter code
explicitly uses this to retake the net brlock, since it gets called
from different paths.
Implement "read_lock_yield" or "wrlock_t" but don't break existing
semantics until 2.7 *please*!
