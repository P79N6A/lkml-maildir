Okay...
Leaving the A and D bits clear means the CPU has to trap to microcode to 
set those bits before it is allowed to load the entry into the TLB. 
Furthermore, and this is the real killer on some CPUs, it is not allowed 
to load those entries speculatively.
As far as I can tell, this is completely pointless for pg0.
(And no, the Voyager code wouldn't be affected.)
