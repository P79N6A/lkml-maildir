Agreed.  In my test setup with two levels of sched_domains,
SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE has not been set in both CPU level and MC level
starting from 2.6.28-rc4.  In a setup with more levels of
sched_domains and if the higher levels have SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE set,
then we will have a functional impact.  
You are right in queueing it for 2.6.29.
Thanks for the clarification.
