And why (1) is a problem is precisely what I don't understand. Nagle is
*supposed* to prevent you from sending multiple remnants. If you don't
like it, you disable it in the sender! However:
The only awkward Nagle-related delay I know of appears with e.g. HTTP,
when the last undersized segment cannot be sent before everything else
is acked. This can be solved using an idea from Greg Minshall, which I
thought was quite cool.
The normal Nagle rule goes:
 - You cannot send a remnant if there are any unacknowledged segments
outstanding
Minshall's version goes:
 - You cannot send a remnant if there is already one unacknowledged
remnant outstanding
This fixes the trailing remnant problem with HTTP and similar
request-reply protocols, while adherring to the spirit of Nagle. There
was even an I-D at some point but for some reason it has not been
updated.
