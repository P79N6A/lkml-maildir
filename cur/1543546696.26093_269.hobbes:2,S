Since I tried to upgrade to 2.2.17 (pre6) from the rock stable 2.2.12
on two of my SMP systems (ASUS PL97DS and P2B-DS, both PII 512Mb,Scsi)
I've got lockup problems, which have made 2.2.17 unusable for me so
I continued to run 2.2.12 for work. I've not yet checked the kernels
in between but tried with the later 2.4.0-test kernels instead.
I had problems catching these rare lockups in 2.2.17 (about once a
normal work day) but now in the later test kernels they show up much
quicker and are also very much easier to catch thanks to the NMI watchdog
in comb with a serial console. The problem is also very easy reproducable
in the later 2.4.0-test kernels. All I have to do is to boot the system
and move the mouse (PS2, alone on irq 12) quickly back and forth a couple
of times. I don't need to start X. Of course I can't be sure that the
lockup problem is the same in 2.2.17pre6 and 2.4.0-test* but each time
I've got the lockup in 2.2.17 it has been after a mouse move.
I provide the kernel message (looks almost identical each time)
together with it's decoding by ksymoops. I also provide /proc/interrupts.
As I'm not sure if this problem is related to SMP or not I CC this
message to linux-smp too. I've got one similar lockup, after mouse move,
with 2.2.17pre6 on my laptop too but I've not been able to install 
2.4.0-test* there due to not being able to compile the pcmcia package
(3.1.19) in the 2.4.0-test* environment.
suggestion:
I think it would be nice if it was possible to add an automatic
disk sync, in cases it is still possible, after the console message
from the nmi-watchdog. It's very annoying with these lengthy disk
checks after each reboot on large hard disks.
