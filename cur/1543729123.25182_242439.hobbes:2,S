Yep.  This looks like a bug to me.  While jackd, itself, seems to
allocate everything before calling driver->start(), the ALSA driver
internally calls malloc() *after* calling snd_pcm_start().  I doubt
anyone has ever made a concerted effort to clean up this path for
realtime safety.
I think it should be fixed (I need to study the code in more detail).
There's probably nothing to prevent us moving the free() and malloc()
calls up nearer the top of alsa_driver_start().  That will probably
require an extra error test and free in case snd_pcm_start() fails.
