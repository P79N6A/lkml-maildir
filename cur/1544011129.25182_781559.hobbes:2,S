Hmm, nor is option 2.  Now I understand where you were coming from and
I sympathize with your dilemna, but I don't think that non-x86 archs should
pay for it where local_t is used as intended, so I don't think local_t should
be (have been) hijacked for this.  nmi_safe_t?

atomic_long_t implementations don't have to.  local_irq_save does it
as a side effect.  You're right about multiple counters tho.  We can
either do it conditionally or unconditionally, but I think unconditional
makes sense (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y seems to be less popular than it was).

Well, we did this for 32-bit x86 some time ago, so that works today.
64-bit was delayed because of the stack protection code, which needs
a fixed offset for the canary so needs zero-based percpu, but IIRC
that's orthogonal to the CPU_OPS work itself.
Here's the timing diff when trivalue is fixed here (preempt on)
Before:
	local_inc=45 local_add=45 cpu_local_inc=6 local_read=21 local_add_return=127
After:
	local_inc=47 local_add=47 cpu_local_inc=6 local_read=41 local_add_return=127
Since sparc64 has CONFIG_PREEMPT=n in its defconfig, I think it is still
ahead with trivalue.
Thanks,
Rusty.
