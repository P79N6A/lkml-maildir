BTW ppc64_defconfig didn't quite like 2.6.23-rc6-mm1 either ...
IIRC I got build failures in:
drivers/ata/pata_scc.c
drivers/md/raid6int8.c
drivers/net/spider_net.c
drivers/net/pasemi_mac.c
drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c
I was in a hurry so didn't record the errors, just noted down the files
and disabled them from .config and continued building ... I'll get back
to fixing these up tonight (if you don't do that by then already).
