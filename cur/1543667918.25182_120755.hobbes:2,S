AFAIK, s390 is the only architecture that has hardware support for taking
system dumps without the lkcd patch. Since the lkcd patch does not
appear to be going into mainline linux and most s390 users want the
kerntypes anyway (every distributor includes them), arch/s390/boot
seems to be the right place to put them.

You need to include the struct definition for every data type that you
want lcrash to know about. E.g. if you want to analyse scsi structures
in a crash dump, you have to include drivers/scsi/scsi.h.
Most internal information about s390 devices is in structs defined
in drivers/s390/cio/, so we need them as well.
This is not an attempt to sneak the (mostly unrelated) lkcd patch in. If they
ever get included, we can still do a merge of the kerntypes file, but until 
then it is just a tiny architecture special file that everybody else can 
ignore.
