Hmm, that code must have been recently added -- (checking) yup, as per
2.4.0-test5. So yes you are right, if you drop io_request_lock you must
either a) do your own stuff to provide mutual exclusion, or b) be prepared
to handle reentrance.

Same deal as above -- since test5, drivers can now get away with not
flushing the whole queue because __make_request calls the request fn
for non-plugged queues. This would have given you big problems in earlier
2.4 kernels.

The driver is free to fiddle with the first request in any way it wants
without holding the io_request_lock, _assuming_ that it has an active
queue head. For drivers that don't (scsi, for one) io_request_lock must
always be held when messing with the queue.
