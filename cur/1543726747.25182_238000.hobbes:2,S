When i upgraded my laptop from 2.6.8-rc2 -> rc2-bk11 using
old .config and "make oldconfig" etc everything seemed fine.
After reboot i suddenly didn't have networking and my
orinoco_cs couldn't be found. It turned out that i had 
to enable hermes in PCI first to get an pcmcia modules.
That seems like a bug to me!
just thought i would mention it here
