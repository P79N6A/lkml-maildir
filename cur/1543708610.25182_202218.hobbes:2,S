Thanks!

Yes, it does. But I haven't really _used_ 2.6 on that box, so I don't know
whether the same problem occurs in 2.6.
So far the problem got triggered only twice since I upgraded to 2.4.23 about 3
months ago. I wanted to be sure it still happened, that's why it took me that
long to resend the patch...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
