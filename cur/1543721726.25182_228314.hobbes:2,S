Not really. The 2.6 kernel series allow to put output files in a
different directory than the sources -- see the O= option; there is a
little documentation in the main Makefile. Without the O= option, the
kernel sources and object files needed to compile external modules will
reside in the same directory. With the O= option, they will reside in
different directories. This means that a single /lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/build symlink is not sufficient anymore. Therefore we have the build
symlink pointing to the output files, and a new source symlink pointing
to the real source tree. This change hasn't found its way into mainline
yet, which is unfortunate. For the discussion, see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108628265102121&w=2 and
follow-ups. I keep pinging Sam Ravnborg (the kbuild maintainer), but
apparently he is busy with other projects at the moment.
In addition, there is an extra Makefile in /lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/build that has the usual targets needed for module building, so the
traditional way of building modules (make -C /lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/build modules SUBDIRS=$(pwd)) still works. There is no need to build
scripts, scripts_basic, or whatever in that directory.
Based on this difference, there are two principal ways to build external
modules since 2.6.7 (and through back-porting also in the current SUSE
kernels, which are based on 2.6.5).  We chose to ship the kernel sources
in /usr/src/linux in a (mostly) unconfigured state, and put the output
files needed for building external modules below /usr/src/linux-obj/. 
 This means that you have several choices:
  - Configure the kernel sources in /usr/src/linux as you wish.
  - Use one of the standard SUSE configurations.
I have written a HOWTO describing how to work with the SUSE kernel
sources, which is available as /usr/src/linux/README.SUSE in our
packages. An up-to-date online version is available at
http://www.suse.de/~agruen/kernel-doc/.
