No. You misunderstood conception again. Idea is simple: user DO NOT NEED TO DO
ANYTHING before floppy removal. But when program tries to write on removed
floppy (even if there are other floppy inserted and even used) kernel will send
message to notification daemon with request to put old floppy back. Process is
stopped and all dirty buffers are kept in memory till floppy is changed back.
When "right" floppy is inserted dirty buffers will be put on said floppy and
process can continue. Without such protection ANY supermount implementations
are just invitations to disaster. And THAT will require lots of changes in VFS.
P.S. Of course if there are three or five processes actively working on with
files on three of five floppies then user's life will be tough but he's asked
for this...
