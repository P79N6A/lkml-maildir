Here is the SiS620/5513 report

Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
The Promise Ultra66 is a good offboard solution.
HighPoint HPT366 is in the mail somewhere and may come in both the
on/offboard releases.  I am waiting on a PCI card version of the chipset.
ABIT BP6 MB which has onboard UDMA-66 with a Triones/HighPoint HPT366, and
someone is send me one of these toys when they get one.
I have all the docs on the SiS620/5513 and HighPoint HPT366 and they both
follow the standard; whereas, Promise PDC20262 Ultra66 is total guess
work.
