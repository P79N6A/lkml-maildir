I remember these hangs: Sometimes when I moved the mouse the system
simply hang. Ingo Molnar recommended me a special kernel
that showed "Unexpected Interrupt XXX" before hanging. He then wrote
a patch and with that one the problems vanished completly. 
Now my machine (Gigabyte 586 DX, 2*P200) is rock solid.
I also heavily use NFS.
What I do not know is if Ingo integrated his patch in kernels > 2.2.3,
so if one of you wants to have a look at it I could send it to him.
