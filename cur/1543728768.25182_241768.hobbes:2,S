We use both, though the breakage I was trying to fix was with a dgram 
socket.
You are correct that it does not work for dgram sockets at all! I had 
not noticed the difference between the two in the test case I wrote, 
since I hadn't tested streams. Thanks for pointing that out. Note that 
shutdown will cause a dgram socket to exit from a recv* call though, as 
this is the workaround I am using right now. On Solaris close will do 
the job. However when the recv from ends it returns 0, but does not set 
errno, which indicates that there may be more data that can be retrieved 
with another call to recv. On Solaris both shutdown and close cause 
errno to be set.
There is no way then to cause a select on a dgram socket to break out at 
all short of kludging some dgram packet transmission to cause it to happen.
Yech!
Thanks for looking into the issue more,
