Hi,
I found that in -mm tree, function pci_disable_device() clears bars_enabled variable, so that pci_release_regions can not release reserved PCI I/O and memory resource. Some device driver programs in kernel tree call pci_release_regions function after pci_disable_device(), that will cause some problem.
And I do not know whether pci_disable_device() function should be modified or device drivers should be adjusted.
Thanks
bibo,mao
