    It would seem that in 2.5.34 gendisk->part[0] no longer refers to the
    whole disk, but instead refers to the first partition.  Is this
    correct? There isn't a struct hd_struct that refers to the whole disk
    anymore?
    I'm working on porting forward the sard patch for disk statistics, so I
    want to make sure this is the intent and not an off-by-one bug. Other
    code, though, suggests it's intentional.

Great -- that helps.  Is there an hd_struct for the whole disk anymore?
Are there additional changes forthcoming, or is this the extent of the
gendisk changes?
