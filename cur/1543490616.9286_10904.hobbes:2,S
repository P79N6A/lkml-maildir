In the irq a cli will be a nono because we are just returning to usermode
or whatever and so we'll just restore the interrupts state of the previous
level. Maybe you want to avoid to get a new nested irq that may start a
new bh handling inside the envinronment of the first irq?
A __cli() in schedule() will be for sure a nono. But if we __cli() there
we can at least change the:
	spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
to
	spin_lock(&runqueue_lock);
in schedule().
It will be interesting to know if it was really a stack depth problem...
