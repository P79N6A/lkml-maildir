The dual opteron is the nfs server
The dual athlon is the 2.4 nfs client
The dual PIII is the 2.6 nfs client

Certainly;

I got an 'invalid snaplen' with the 90000 you suggested, the above dump
is done with 9000 - if you need another snaplen please just let me know.
A little explanation for the IPs you see;
 sparrow/10.0.1.20 - nfs server
 raven/10.0.1.7 - 2.6 nfs client
 osprey/10.0.1.13 - NIS/DNS server
Thanks,
