This reduces the debug output even further (and size of debug output is
strongly correlated with time taken to do a null build):

Seems like it gets rid of the RCS and SCCS rules -- certainly a big
improvement, and I'm not sure anyone really uses those rules.  Can we
perhaps uncomment this line at the beginning of 2.6.12 and see if anyone
complains?  This should reduce make overhead by 30-40% which is really
worth doing.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
