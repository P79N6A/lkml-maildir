I rebuilt with agpgart, intel-agp and i810 as modules, modprobed them,
and it works.
  Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
  agpgart: Detected an Intel i810 E Chipset.
  agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 320M
  agpgart: detected 4MB dedicated video ram.
  agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
  [drm] Initialized i810 1.4.0 20030605 on minor 0: Intel Corp. 82810E DC-133 CGC [Chipset Graphics Controller]
Very odd.
Here is the modinfo output for intel-agp.
