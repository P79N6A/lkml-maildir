Chuck, can you take a look at this?
Kenny is seeing what a hang when using pwrite64() on an O_DIRECT file
and the file size exceeds 4Gb. Server is a NetApp filer w/ NFSv3.
I had a quick look at nfs_file_direct_write(), and among other things,
it would appear that it is not doing any of the usual overflow checks on
*pos and the count size (see generic_write_checks()). In particular,
checks are missing against overflow vs. MAX_NON_LFS if O_LARGEFILE is
not set (and also against overflow vs. s_maxbytes, but that is less
relevant here).
Cheers,
  Trond
