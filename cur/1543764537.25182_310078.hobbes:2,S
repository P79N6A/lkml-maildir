Isn't this a rare case? The whole group is relatively full and the free
bits are all reserved by other files.  Probably we should avoid trying
to make reservation in this block group at the first place, if we could
find a way to detect the number of _usable_ free bits are less than the
requested window size.

You are proposing that we hold the read lock first, do the window search
and bitmap scan, then once we confirm there is free bit in the candidate
window, we grab the write lock and update the tree?  
I think this is a good idea to address case you have concerned: when we
need to do lots of window search before settle down. Also if later we
decide (I think we have discussed this before) to always try to reserve
the window with at least 8 contigous free blocks, the search will be
more expensive and the read lock will help.
However I am still worried that the rw lock will allow concurrent files
trying to lock the same window at the same time. Only one succeed
though., high cpu usage then.  And also, in the normal case the
filesystem is not really full, probably rw lock becomes expensive.
