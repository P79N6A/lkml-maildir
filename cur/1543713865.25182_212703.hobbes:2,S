Empty prefered is a special case. It means DEFAULT.  This is useful
when you have a process policy != DEFAULT, but want to set a specific
VMA to default. Normally default in a VMA would mean use process policy.

This is to catch uninitialized bits. Otherwise it could work on a kernel
with small MAX_NUMNODES, and then suddenly fail on a kernel with bigger
MAX_NUMNODES when a node isn't online.

And that after all the whining about sharing policies? ;-) (a BIND policy will
always carry a zonelist). As far as I can see all existing zonelist code
just walks it until NULL.
I would not be opposed to always using a full one, but it would use considerably
more memory in many cases.

Yep.
