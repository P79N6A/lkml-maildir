ok I like the idea; I would propose though to make the 0.1 msec a sysctl or something,
so that people who really care about latencies lower than that can just set that lower.
(and the tool can then read the value and use that)

yeah for the total it makes sense; I'll do the sysctl thing for the threshold
and integrate this idea as well. Thanks a lot!
