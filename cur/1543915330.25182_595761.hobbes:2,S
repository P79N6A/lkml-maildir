Why don't you share your specific concerns?

Not sure what you mean by extend netlink.  We do run the user daemons 
under mlockall of course, this is one of the rules I stated earlier for 
daemons running in the block IO path.  The problem is, if this 
userspace daemon allocates even one page, for example in sys_open, it 
can deadlock.  Running the daemon in PF_MEMALLOC mode fixes this 
problem robustly, provided that the necessary audit of memory 
allocation patterns and library dependencies has been done.
I suppose you are worried that the userspace code could unexpectedly 
allocate a large amount of memory and exhaust the entire PF_MEMALLOC 
reserve?  Kernel code could do that too.  This userspace code just 
needs to be checked carefully.  Perhaps we could come up with a kernel 
debugging option to verify that a task does in fact stay within some 
bounded number of page allocs while in PF_MEMALLOC mode.

Daniel
