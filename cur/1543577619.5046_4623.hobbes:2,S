    The tdfxfb code does.  When compiled into the kernel, there is a function
(tdfxfb_setup) which the kernel calls with the relevant kernel command-line
parameters.  When compiled as a module, this function is ifdef'ed out, as well
it should be, because I don't think that there is a function which is called to
pass the module parameters.  Modules use MODULE_PARM to 'import' their
parameters.  The code is incomplete, perhaps for a reason.  In theory, the
author should add the required MODULE_PARM macros to export the parameters and
then move the code which does anything besides saving the paramter values to
tdfxfb_init, which is called when the module is loaded /and/ after tdfxfb_setup
when compiled into the kernel.  I don't have the time to fix it myself, I don't
even have a machine with Linux and a Voodoo3 card.

    It does, but only when compiled into the kernel due to the way it does its's
setup.
