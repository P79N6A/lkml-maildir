After checking through the code, I can't see any way that "noprobe" with an
existing device would ever work on 2.4. Unless I'm missing something the
only place where "drive->id" is allocated is in do_probe() which isn't
called for a device with "noprobe" set, yet all the config_drive_xfer_rate()
functions will oops if "drive->id" is NULL.
Is "noprobe" on an existing device no longer supported in 2.4?
