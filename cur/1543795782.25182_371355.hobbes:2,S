Could you provide an example of where the ERRNO is not an integer? It 
doesn't take on bit values, nor can I spot a plcae where the value is so 
large it would overflow if signed.
See errno.h for a starting point. I do think error_t is a good idea, 
although I doubt there's an example of a type mismatch going uncaught 
without it.
