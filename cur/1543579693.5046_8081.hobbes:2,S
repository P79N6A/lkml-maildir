I am not sure about Linux IDEs, but when I programmed Objective-C using the 
OpenStep IDE, you could not only do auto-completion on those, but on any 
word that had been previously used.  That was cool, and didn't cause wacky 
problems like you might think it would (auto-completing words like the, to, 
for, etc when trying to type something else).
JBuilder comes close, so I am guessing the Klyx will also.  I sent an email 
suggestion to Inprise, excuse me..Borland, on the subject last year.  They 
seemed to like it.
