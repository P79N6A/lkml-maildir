My request is to enable the IPv6 API whenever the IPv4 code is enabled.

This would work, as long as IPv6 cannot be disabled without also
disabling IPv4.

Because it is much simpler and cleaner to choose the implementation of
the comatibility layer at compile time.  Having to make this choice at
runtime makes code inefficient and hard to maintain.

What on earth is your definiton of "application policy?"
This is akin to saying that "if the kernel is built with this option,
you have to use a struct direct, otherwise you have to use a struct
dirent."  This is not "policy", this is "working around kernel
limitations."  We applications engineers hate you kernel engineers for
making us go through crap like this.
