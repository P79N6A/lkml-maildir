I am considering the possibility for the x86 ppro fix but firstly I want
to be sure the spin_unlock change is necessary. The PCI one is much less
of an impact since we don't go around doing it all the time.

For testing purposes it won't be needed thankfully - a non nop patched
module might just be a tiny bit slower. 
Anyway firstly I have to reasonably show PPro errata 66/92 are what is
causing the odd weird ppro crash (the evidence so far is the xchg
based unlock helps). The WC v UC misordered store one is a proven case,
as is the 0x70000000->0x7003FFFF wbinvd hang which turns up on some ppro
boxes that never got the bios E820 fixup
