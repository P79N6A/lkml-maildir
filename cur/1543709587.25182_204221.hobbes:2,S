Yup. I hacked something checking my driver was still open, not
sure it's robust enough at this point though.

For that one, I don't need to drop it. I'm just returning from
the receive_chars to the irq indicating the main irq routine
that something happened. It then calls tty_flip_buffer_push()
after releasing the lock.

Yup.

Yup.

I was afraid you would say that ... :)
