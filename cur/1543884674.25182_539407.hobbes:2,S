No, because the way you turn them on (as intended) is to do:
perl -pi -e 's/undef/define/ if m/CONFIG_ACORNSCSI_CONSTANTS/' \
 drivers/scsi/arm/acornscsi.c
(or via your text editor).
An alternative way around the issue is to keep a separate patch
outside of mainline which patches the additional code and data into
the driver.  That's far less maintainable, and leads to additional
problems.
