The alpha returns a faliure since day zero of iommu support, the sparc64
has too otherwise it's even more buggy than alpha when the machine runs
out of pci virtual address space.

About the pci_map_single API I'd like if bus address 0 would not be the
indication of faluire, mainly on platforms without an iommu that's not
nice, x86 happens to get it right only because the physical page zero is
reserved for completly other reasons. so we either add a err parameter
to the pci_map_single, or we define a per-arch bus address to indicate
an error, either ways are ok from my part.
