Well that was interesting.
- All the patches had mangled headers:
-- linux-2.6.13-rc2-mm1-16/...
+++ linux-2.6.13-rc2-mm1-17/...
  instead of
--- linux-2.6.13-rc2-mm1-16/...
+++ linux-2.6.13-rc2-mm1-17/...
  Which I fixed up.
- The second patch didn't apply.  I fixed that too.
- The patches add lots of trailing whitespace.  I habitually trim that
  off, figuring that any downstream merging hassle which that causes is
  just punishment ;)
Please check that it all landed OK in the next -mm.
I've hung on to Tom Duffy's patch pending a test compilation.
I'll tentatively consider this material to be not-for-2.6.13?
