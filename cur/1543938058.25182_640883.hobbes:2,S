The extra rom[0] check is flagging valid temperatures as invalid when
there is already a CRC data transmission check.
w1_therm_read_bin()
	if (rom[8] == crc && rom[0])
		verdict = 1;
Requiring rom[0] to be non-zero will flag as invalid temperature
conversions when the low byte is zero, specifically the temperatures
0C, 16C, 32C, 48C, -16C, -32C, and -48C.
The CRC check is produced on the device for the previous 8 bytes and
is required to ensure the data integrity in transmission.  I don't see
why the extra check for rom[0] being non-zero is in there.  Evgeniy
Polyakov didn't know either.  Just for a check I unplugged the sensor,
executed a temperature conversion, and read the results.  The read
was all ff's, which also failed the CRC, so it doesn't need to protect
against a disconnected sensor.
I have more extensive patches in the work, but these two trivial ones
will do for today.  I would like to hear from people who use the
ds2490 USB to one wire dongle.  1 if you would be willing to test the
patches as I currently only have the one sensor on a short parisite
powered wire, 2 if there is any cheap sources for the ds2490.
