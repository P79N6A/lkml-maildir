No, although Andrew mentioned he had worked on it to me.
Looking it over...its of course very similar.  One thing to note is his
patch doesn't incorporate the bits from Ingo's patch that I borrowed. 
I.e., use of cpu_online_map, the forcing of the reschedule, etc.  I
favor some of the differences in my variant.
I am glad to see he wrote a proc_write function, because I was worried I
was reimplementing something there, but I suppose not.
Either way, I'd like to see one of these in the kernel.
