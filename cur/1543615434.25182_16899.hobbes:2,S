Hello, everyone, there is an front-end raw character
devices in Linux kernel 2.4.  It can be bound to any
block devices to provide genuine Unix raw character
device semantics. Does that mean that this device can
intercept the communications to/from the specific
block device? It seems not. I've tested that on floppy
disk device. Is that true? Can anyone give me an
example of how to test this raw character device?
Thanks in advance.
Michael
