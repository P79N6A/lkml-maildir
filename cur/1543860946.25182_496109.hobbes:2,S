The submitting process plugs itself, submits all its IO, then unplugs
itself (ie. so the plug is now on the process, rather than the block
device).
So long as AIO threads do the same, there would be no problem (plugging
is optional, of course).
This (is supposed to) give a number of improvements over the traditional
plugging (although some downsides too). Most notably for me, the VM gets
cleaner ;)
However AIO could be an interesting case to test for explicit plugging
because of the way they interact. What kind of improvements do you see
with samba and do you have any benchmark setups?
Thanks,
Nick
