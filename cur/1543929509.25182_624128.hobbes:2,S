Well I am pretty sure the micro kernel of OS X is in C, and certainly
the BSD layer is as well.  So the only ObjC part would be the nextstep
framework and other parts of the Mac GUI and other Mac APIs they
provide, which all at some point probably end up calling down into the C
stuff below.

But kmalloc is implemented by the kernel.  Who implements 'new'?
