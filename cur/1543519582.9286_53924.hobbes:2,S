Almost always.  It's either `make', `./configure; make', or `gcc -o foo
foo.c'.  I can't remember the last time I had to use a system dependent
setting for the build process.  (Configuration is a different matter).
In this case `./configure' wouldn't be enough because, well, where are
your kernel header files?  OTOH it would work much of the time to check
that <linux/version.h> and <linux/config.h> match the running kernel
version, in either /usr/include/linux or /usr/src/linux/include/linux.
A bit of a pain for those one C source file distributions though.

I like to keep things easy for the folks who use my software.
