gcc 3.4.x works great on both 2.6 and 2.4, no issues whatsoever.

it's even easier to not do that and install and compile everything in one rootfs, which 
is perfectly possible and I have done so many times. You can leave away the chroot and 
any possible security issues that you fear, allthough those are pretty much nonexistant.
The only real bottom line issue is that module-init-tools cannot load modules on a 2.4 
kernel, and modutils doesn't do that on 2.6, so you will have to switch or wrap them to 
detect the running kernel. The same goes for udev vs. devfs.
of course, setting up a qemu image or separate partition is easier, but that was not the 
question I think.
Most binary distro's won't support this, but I think all of the source distro's and more 
specific ones support it and a few handle it out of the box.
Cheers,
