Ok, after losing a disk in the early 2.5 series, and not being able to
compile pretty much any kernel since 2.5.33, I decided to give 2.5.39 a
try last weekend.
Built kernel, rebooted, almost seems to get stuch during the ide-probing
(10 seconds wait is a conservative estimate), but it came up in single
user. Checking for errors in /proc/kmsg, nothing. Great reboot
multiuser start X open a window lose all access to my keyboard. Completely
log in remotely with ssh, hmm kernel errors about unknown scancodes.
Reboot, just don't use X for the moment, maybe I can catch an oops,
lockup during boot while loading the uhci usb driver. Alt-sysrq works,
another fsck later (these seem to take a lot longer, but that could be
subjective). Disable hotplug/usb during startup, reboot, within 2
minutes orinoco_cs driver locks up and starts throwing debugging goo
about transmit timeouts and resetting card. Nice, except for the fact
that interrupts seem to be disabled and this time magic-sysrq doesn't
work.
Pull the battery out to be able to reboot the laptop, and went back to
2.4.20-latest for now. 2.5.33 did work mostly (after fixing up a bunch
of compile fixes and the oss cs4281 driver), but seems to last only
about 1 hour on battery life vs. the solid 3 1/2 hours with a 2.4 kernel.
All of this is on a Thinkpad X20, which doesn't have a serial console.
Using APM, not ACPI. But this is not a bugreport, because I haven't even
got a chance to isolate any single problem in a way that I can create a
useful report.

I am a bit worried, at least as far as Coda is concerned, there is a lot
of unmerged stuff, and as long as I can't do any testing of the changes
it is a bit useless to send them off to Linus. I hope things stabilize
before the feature freeze.
