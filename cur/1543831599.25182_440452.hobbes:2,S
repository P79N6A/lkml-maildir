Due to the problems pointed what would be really needed is a filesystem
with a full log of operations. Then the fs state (full contents of all
files etc.) at any given time can be restored.
May not be very efficient, though (probably people doing databases and
transaction logging have something to say). I'd rather have better
backups (so I can restore from them) instead of such logging.
