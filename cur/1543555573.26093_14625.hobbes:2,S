The sundance driver in 2.4.0-test11 doesn't seem to like a DFE-550
that I have
On module installation te driver identifies the card but cant  find any
PHYs, also if I remove the module afterwards I can't reinsert it.
Any suggestions?
The messages are
On installation:
eth0: OEM Sundance Technology ST201 at 0xca858000, 00:50:ba:02:95:70, IRQ 11.
eth0: No MII transceiver found!, ASIC status 62
On re-installation
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test11/kernel/drivers/net/sundance.o: init_module: No such device
Using /lib/modules/2.4.0-test11/kernel/drivers/net/sundance.o
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
