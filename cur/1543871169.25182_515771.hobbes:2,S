I know, i just referred your "Barring anything extremely serious, this will be 
the last 2.6.18 based release." sentence from last stable release 
announcement and some security regressions seems something to me and just 
want to ping :) and of course i clearly understand your point of -stable tree 
maintanence with much more up2date kernel and drop olders view.
Cheers
