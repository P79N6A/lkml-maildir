That's part of the point.  In this driver, I try to control when things are 
done and keep track of them in a deterministic way.  Using a return code to 
tell us a function we called did nothing when we shouldn't have called it in 
the first place if it wasn't going to do anything is backwards from the way 
I prefer to handle things.  Namely, find out why the function was called 
when it shouldn't have been and solve the problem.  Note: I don't follow 
that philosophy on all functions, only on very simple ones like this, there 
are a lot of complex functions where you want the function to make those 
decisions.  So, like I said, personal preference on how to handle these things.

It's intended to do exactly that.  A lot of what makes this driver work 
properly right now is the LVI handling.  That was severly busted when I 
first got hold of the driver.  I *want* things to break if the LVI handling 
is changed by someone else because that will alert me to the fact that the 
LVI handling is then busted (at least, if they change it incorrectly, if 
they do things right then they will catch problems like this and fix them 
properly and I won't have to do anything).
