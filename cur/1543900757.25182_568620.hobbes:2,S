Yes and no.  If that will get things moving in the direction of
getting rid of the stack size as a config option, then I'm all for it.
But on the other hand it is my personal opinion that this is an area
where we should just make up our minds as to whether we want 4K or 8K
stacks and whether we want interrupt stacks or not, and then not have
it configurable at all.  I believe the goal is 4K stacks + interrupt
stacks, so let's just aim for that and get rid of the configurability
of the damn thing - make a choice, make it work, make it be that
that's what we use and rid ourselves of the alternatives...
