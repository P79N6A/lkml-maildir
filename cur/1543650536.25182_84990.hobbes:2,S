Fwiw, I agree with the above (I'm having a think about it).
I also agree with criticisms that epoll should test and send an event
on registration, but only _if_ the test is cheap.  Nothing to do with
correctness (I like the edge semantics as they are), but because
delivering one event is so infinitesimally low impact with epoll that
it's preferable to doing a single speculative read/write/whatever.
Regarding the effectiveness of the optimisation, I'd guess that quite
a lot of incoming connections do not come with initial data in the
short scheduling time after a SYN (unless it's on a LAN).  I don't
know this for sure though.
