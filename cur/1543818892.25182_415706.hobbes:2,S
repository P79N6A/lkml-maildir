It is not the only obstacle. There are another ones:
1. Different values of segment registers. __USER32_* selectors should match
   ones on i386.
2. ia32 vsyscall page. It also must be the same, unless arch/i386 is changed
   to allow various mappins like 32bit page x86_64 works.
Well, if we want something to migrate, we have to pay.
