The call to lookup_one_len() by fs/devpts/inode.c:get_node() ultimately
calls permission(...,MAY_EXEC,...) on the devpts root directory, which
will call security_inode_permission() -> selinux_inode_permission() to
check search access to the directory.  Hence, get_node() can fail if
SELinux is enabled and the process has no permission at all to
search /dev/pts.  If it can get that far, then the inode will ultimately
have its security label set upon the d_instantiate() call (via
security_d_instantiate() -> selinux_d_instantiate()), and be
subsequently checked for opens/reads/writes via the
selinux_inode_permission() and selinux_file_permission() hook functions.
