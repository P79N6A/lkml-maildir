Yes, for some reason the July patch never got applied to that (now
outdated) 2.6.10 version of relayfs - either that patch or yours
should fix the problem - thanks for sending it.  In any case, the
version of relayfs you're using is now ancient history - the latest
redux versions of relayfs recently posted to lkml have completely
changed or removed all that code, so you might want to try testing
with the latest patch (which I'm still reworking parts of even now).
Thanks,
Tom
