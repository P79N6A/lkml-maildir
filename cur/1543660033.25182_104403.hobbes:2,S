Well, that starts being a KO criterium. I'd like to see a laptop like
this:
	- one or two serial interfaces
	- modem
	- IrDA
	- TFT display, with a nice graphics chipset (I'd like to have
	  ATI, but with a good, free driver, and it's own RAM, no UMA
	  stuff...)
	- Large HDD
	- Good akku, best with possibility to plug an external extra
	  akku onto it
	- PC like keyboard layout (with the 6 keys above the cursur keys
	  kept togeather, not as a row on the keyboard's right side or
	  so...). I don't need those Windows(R) extra keys, neither do I
	  need extra "email", "web" ot the like keys...
	- CPU (i386, ppc, ...) doesn't really matter, but of course I'd
	  like to see Linux support:-)
	- network interface (100MBit/sec is okay, GBE is nice, too:-)
	- Floppy
	- CDROM, maybe DVD or CD-RW or sth like that, but that's IMHO
	  not that important.
	- parport
	- VGA out (I personally don't need TV in/out)
	- USB? Well, I don't need it:-) I don't like it...
	- Firewire. Yeah:-)
Anyone?
MfG, JBG
