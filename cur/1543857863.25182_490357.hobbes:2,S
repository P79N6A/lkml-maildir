Subject: [PATCH] get rid of ARCH_HAVE_XTIME_LOCK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

As suggested by Andrew, we can use __attribute__((weak)) to get rid of 
ARCH_HAVE_XTIME_LOCK
Please note I compiled, and boot tested on ia32 this patch, and it seems OK.
I compiled on x86_64 and got same resulting vmlinux image.
But I suspect some tools might have problems because vmlinux have its 
first 'weak data symbol' defined. AFAIK __attribute__((weak)) was only used 
on text symbols.
# nm vmlinux | grep ' V '
c03b01c0 V xtime_lock
[PATCH] get rid of ARCH_HAVE_XTIME_LOCK
ARCH_HAVE_XTIME_LOCK is used by x86_64 arch . This arch needs to place a read 
only copy of xtime_lock into vsyscall page. This read only copy is named 
__xtime_lock, and xtime_lock is defined in arch/x86_64/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S 
as an alias. So the declaration of xtime_lock in kernel/timer.c was guarded 
by ARCH_HAVE_XTIME_LOCK define, defined to true on x86_64.
We can get same result with _attribute__((weak)) in the declaration. linker 
should do the job.
