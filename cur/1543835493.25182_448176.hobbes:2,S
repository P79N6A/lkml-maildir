When some process tries to access a file that is not
cached in RAM, AFAICT. All partitions are mounted with
noatime.

Yes. But both machines are very different. The working
machine is an amd64 with nforce2. The machine that gets
stuck is a 2 GHz Pentium M with some Intel chipset:
00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FW (ICH6/ICH6W) SATA Controller (rev 04)
00:1f.2 0101: 8086:2651 (rev 04)
Sorry, surely I should have mentioned this before. The
problem isn't _that_ reproducible.
