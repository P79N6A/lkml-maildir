the ERESTARTNOHAND thing is handled in arch specific signal code,
syscalls can return -ERESTARTNOHAND as much as they want (and your
change breaks the current behaviour of select()).
For example:
arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c
        /* Are we from a system call? */
        if ((long)regs->orig_rax >= 0) {
                /* If so, check system call restarting.. */
                switch (regs->rax) {
                        case -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK:
                        case -ERESTARTNOHAND:
                                regs->rax = -EINTR;
                                break;
