So the intent is to have compiled-in drivers for already-attached
devices (framebuffer, system disks, loop, whatever) generate calls to
/sbin/hotplug within initramfs?
Mainly I'm asking because I did try putting a hotplug script into an
initramfs a few weeks ago (using -test7), and it didn't appear to be
invoked for e.g. the VESA framebuffer. So I want to make sure this is a
"future" capability and not something that should have worked :-)
