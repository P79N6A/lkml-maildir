dev->tbusy doesn't necessarily cover it. Devices set tbusy when they're, well, 
busy - not just when they're down.
My first use for the 'new' semantics was going to be to add it to the 
hostess_sv11 driver, and make diald automatically bring up the ISDN line when 
the leased line goes down. 
I don't want diald bringing up the backup link because the leased line just 
happens to be sending a packet when it checks.
