Hi! Pavel,
Could you do me just one tiny favor?
Please consider attempting an error recovery level path, maybe ...
Every patch I have glanced at has 'panic("blah blah");'
If you do not have enough hardware to generate an accurate path for
recovery, then please do not force the kernel into panic.  Would you
consider failing the request making it jump back to S1 ?  This at least
allows it crash like a power failure.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
