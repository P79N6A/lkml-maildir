I think another method is to add a new attribute into GCC to prepend or
append something to section name instead of just to replace it, like the
example as follow:
#define __initdata  __attribute__((section_append(".init")))
int __initdata early_ioremap_debug_data = 1;
int __initdata early_ioremap_debug_bss;
The GCC can deduce the section (.data or .bss) of global variable based
on whether it is initialized. That is, without attribute,
early_ioremap_debug_data will be in ".data", early_ioremap_debug_bss
will be in ".bss". And with section_append attribute,
early_ioremap_debug_data will be in ".data.init" and
early_ioremap_debug_bss will be in ".bss.init".
