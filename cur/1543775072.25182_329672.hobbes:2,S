Hi,
The next 13 patches implement PCI error recovery along the 
lines of earlier discussions.  Its broken out into little 
pieces for easy digestability.
These should apply cleanly against kernel-2.6.12-git10
Details of what this is, and how it works, are in a
documentation file, part way down the patch.
These patches implement "native" error recovery for five devices:
-- the e100, e1000 and ixgb network cards
-- the ipr and sym53c8xx_2 scsi device drivers
