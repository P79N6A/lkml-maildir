Sure, I have no problem with only global data, and filesystem specific
data being in a super block.  In this case my impression is that the
data is at least arguably filesystem specific.  filesystem-specific
data is ok on the super block is it not?

I haven't and it sounds reasonable to look at.  As far as I know BSDs
don't have my specific problem.  uid mapping is simply a tool for
dealing with the problem, not the problem itself.  A stackable
filesystem is a reasonable alternative to using security keys to
do the mapping.
My real problem is that there is a good case for uids that are not
global to a machine.  The discussion is simply how do you cope with
that.
Now I do believe that there is a good case for uids being global to a
filesystem and all I was really talking about was a tag that marked
which parts of the entire system that used the same uids as the
filesystem.
