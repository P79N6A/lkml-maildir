Yes, I will make the changes to x86_64 exception notifiers as well and
send a patch to you.

NOTIFY_OK does not stop notifying others registered for the same event.
This was causing problems when Kprobes and KGDB co-exist and KGDB handler
would get involked, when kprobes handler would have already handled its own
breakpoint. NOTIFY_BAD will also work, but returning NOTIFY_BAD would mean 
Bad/Veto action. This patch solves the problem by returning NOTIFY_OK | NOTIFY_STOP_MASK in a clean way.
Please let me know your comments.
