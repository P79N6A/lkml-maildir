Oh great! This has been a long standing issue I've never managed to get
around to and your approach to fixing it is simpler then what I was
thinking it would take.
Thanks for knocking this off!

Hmm.. It drops to 350MHz on idle, but only ~800Mhz by on-demand? That
sounds more like the C3 idle TSC halt issue.
