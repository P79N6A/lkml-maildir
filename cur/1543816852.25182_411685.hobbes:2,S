thanks - this looks fine to me, but i'm still worried about the 
nonatomic chain boosting side-effects that i outlined in the previous 
mail.
the tempting property of your patch is the fundamental reschedulability 
of the boosting itself - and the resulting simplicity of locking. On the 
con side, i dont see how we can detect deadlocks reliably, nor how we 
can avoid 'incorrect boosting' (outlined in the previous mail), if the 
chain gets 'broken'.
