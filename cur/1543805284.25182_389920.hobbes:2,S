Forget /dev/sg0, it's meaningless and confusing to try and bind two
unrelated names to each other. You want to talk to /dev/hda, use
/dev/hda. Don't try and create a pseudo mapping between the two. That's
also where cdrecord gets it wrong on Linux - you don't need -scanbus. If
users think they do, it's either because Joerg brain washed them or
because they have been used to that bad interface since years ago when
it was unfortunately needed.
