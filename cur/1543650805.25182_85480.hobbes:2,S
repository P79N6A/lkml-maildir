This is what some Intel person said:
   The optimization the compiler is working around is perfectly legal.
   It isn't legal C/C++ to "use" a parameter after the function has
returned.
   The optimizer knows this, and that is why the code got removed. The
volatile 
   is necessary in order to make this kind of C code work.
The point is that once sys_iopl(unsigned long unused) returns a value,
unused is 
finished. So nobody can do anything with the data associated with it after
that.
