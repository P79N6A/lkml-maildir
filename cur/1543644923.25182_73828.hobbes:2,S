Most of them will be SMP, correct? For SMP, 95% of the memory operations 
occur in the per-cpu arrays. I'm not sure if a slab is really the right 
backend behind the per-cpu arrays - perhaps a algorithms that's more 
aggressive toward finding freeable pages would be a better choice, even 
if it needs more cpu time for sorting/searching through the partially 
allocated pages.
