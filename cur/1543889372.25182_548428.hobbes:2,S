Hopefully Paul can help us...

But how task_lock() can help? cpuset_exit() doesn't take it, it changes ->cpuset
lockless. However, it sets ->cpuset = &top_cpuset, and the comment says:
	* Don't even think about derefencing 'cs' after the cpuset use count

	* or callback_mutex.
	     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So, perhaps cpuset_lock() should be enough.
(That said, looking at cpuset_exit() I can't understand why callback_mutex is
 enough. If it is not, cpuset_cpus_allowed() is not safe either).

migration_call(CPU_DEAD) is called with irqs enabled.
