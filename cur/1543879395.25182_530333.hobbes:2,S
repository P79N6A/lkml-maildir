From a quick look at bnx2.c, it seems that the driver gives the NIC
(firmware?) a block of memory to DMA stats into, and just reads from
that memory in its get_stats method.  So if you're seeing wonky stats
from the NIC intermittently, my best guess would be that firmware is
occasionally writing junk into the stats block.
