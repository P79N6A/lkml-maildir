Well, I've got the world's simplest kernel port (the user-mode port - see 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
).  So, if the lower levels of the 
kernel interest you, that's all pretty simple process-level code.  Fiddling 
with that ought to be a relatively gentle introduction to the complexity that 
lies above it.
If you're interested, let me know, and I think I'll have no trouble dreaming 
up things that need doing :-)
