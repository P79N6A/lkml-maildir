Dear list,
I am constantly running a process creating child processes, running them for a
while, then terminating, restarting and so on...
The process restarted over and over again is the same (same executable) the
launching process doesn't stop.
Running this for a while (or increasing the number of "launchers" but keeping
the launched process the same all the time lets the buffers/cache constantly
grow up to the point where all memory is taken and the machine starts
swapping...
Q:Is there any way to limit the cache/buffe usage? And, if yes, how?
Thanks for the help,
Immanuel
