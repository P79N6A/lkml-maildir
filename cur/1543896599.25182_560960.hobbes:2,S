Looks like it would indeed address the immediate issue on ARM -
IF they've no particular reason to be using kmalloc there.
However... what gives you confidence that flush_dcache_page is
never applied to other slab pages?
This looks to me like a clean way forward to try in -mm; but that
2.6.22 should go with the safety PageSlab test in page_mapping.
