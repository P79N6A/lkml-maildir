While you're at it .. CBQ is actually not a very good alternative
since it doesn't work properly on top of virtual network devices.
The closest match for an alternative would be TBF, but HTB and
HFSC also do fine. Maybe just point to the traffic schedulers in
general. I think you could also change EXPERIMENTAL to OBSOLETE
for the shaper device, the traffic schedulers are a lot more
flexible.
