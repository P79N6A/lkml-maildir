Ingo, I got it. My patch was a hack. Moving on. Seriously there is no need to 
say it ten thousand times ;-).
You clipped the part where I elaborated what exactly is evil about the stop 
machine. I clearly said that yes for some things there is just no other way 
but in general we should _try_ to avoid it. Note that I did not say "we must" 
I'm saying we should try.

That's just not practical. Sure you can have some kind of stripped down 
machine but then you loose a lot of flexibility. Again "should" is the keyword 
here. For a lot of workloads hard-RT has to coexist with a bunch of other things.
