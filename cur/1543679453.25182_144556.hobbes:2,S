One problem is that ptys are not just "used by the user". Every terminal
window opened uses a pty. As does a network connection.
As does "expect" - which is less visible to the user since it is intended
to be invisible.
The real question is "how many PTYs should a single user have?"
Which then prompts the question "How many concurrent users should there be?"
second, just providing a user limit doesn't prevent a denial of service..
Just have more connections than ptys and you are in the same situation.
