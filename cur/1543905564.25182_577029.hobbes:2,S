That all looks pretty reasonable, thanks.
Are we all comfortable with the attributions?  As I have it now, everything
will go in as having been authored by yourself.  There is no formal (ie:
understood-by-git) way of recording joint authorship, unfortunately.  But one
can make a record of such things in the changelog.
I'll queue this material up in the to-be-sent-to-davem queue.
