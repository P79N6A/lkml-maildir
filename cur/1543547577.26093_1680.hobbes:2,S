The Essential RoadRunner HIPPI card has the same 'problem'/. My main
interest in getting scatter/gather working for that one is for receive
since I want to avoid having to allocate 64KB contigous receive
buffers.  Instead I'd like to throw it a pile of pages and then stick
the pages actually used by a packet (it's often less than 64KB) into a
kiobuf and build an skb from that.
