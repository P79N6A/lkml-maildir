It's unclear where the number 0x60000000 comes from. I believe it's
attempting to anticipate the layout of the process address space, in
particular the fact that ELF interpreters are mapped starting at
ELF_ET_DYN_BASE when formatted as dynamic shared objects, (and this
used to happen around 0x60000000 if I remember old ldd output), and in
many cases, all dynamic shared objects are mapped at still higher
addresses. Open-coding this number seems non-portable.
Could someone comment on this?
Cheers,
Bill
I think the author may have had this in mind (though this may still
report inaccurately on a few architectures):
