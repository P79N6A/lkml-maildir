Thanks for such a thorough test Michael.

Yes, true. Right now hrtimer_forward() (that we use to get the "missed" 
ticks) returns an unsigned long, that on 32 bit is (duh!) 32 bit :)
But hrtimer_forward() has all in place to just return an u64. So, Thomas, 
would it be OK to have hrtimer_forward() (and the new hrtimer_forward_now())
to return a u64?

This is been like that from the beginning of the new API. So no, the 
previous was behaving exactly the same WRT this feature.
Is this something really needed?
