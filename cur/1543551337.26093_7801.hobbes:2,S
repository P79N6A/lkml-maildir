Preliminary report after using 1.1.9:
On Module load:
Via 686a audio driver 1.1.9
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, vendor id1: 0x4943, id2: 0x4511 (Unknown)
via82cxxx: board #1 at 0xDC00, IRQ 5
This is on an Epox Mobo, with a AMD Duron.
Whenever I start playback, the following gets dumped into syslog,
although audio is fine:
Assertion failed! chan->slop_len > 0,via82cxxx_audio.c,via_chan_flush_frag,line=963
Assertion failed! wait != NULL,via82cxxx_audio.c,via_dsp_poll,line=2056
Assertion failed! chan->slop_len > 0,via82cxxx_audio.c,via_chan_flush_frag,line=963
Assertion failed! wait != NULL,via82cxxx_audio.c,via_dsp_poll,line=2056
Assertion failed! chan->slop_len > 0,via82cxxx_audio.c,via_chan_flush_frag,line=963
Also, the problem I previouly described still exists:  Whenever I try to
skip through a song, the output gets distorted immensely.  You can still
hear the song playing, but overlayed on it is very harsh noise.  If it
helps, the noise sounds different on 1.1.9 than 1.1.8 :)  Nothing in
syslog, though.  Using esd avoids this problem, as well as just stopping
playback and restarting it.
I'd appreciate any comments!
