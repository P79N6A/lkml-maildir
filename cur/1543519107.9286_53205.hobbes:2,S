Indeed.
Because the PC spec _says_ it is busy, exactly for video cards.
I initially marked only the "regular" video card region busy (the part
that was handled by the text-mode driver), but it quickly became apparent
that in order to make dynamic area allocation work for things like PCMCIA
we had to mark the whole video area busy.

Why not? I can basically guarantee that it's going to be marked busy for
you.
