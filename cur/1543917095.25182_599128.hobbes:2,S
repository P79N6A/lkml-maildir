Hmm, even still I agree with Auke, you probably use it too much.

Actually due to the performance penalty on some systems I think you  
only want to use it if the chance of succeeding is 99% or better, as  
the benefit if predicted is a cycle or two and the harm if  
mispredicted can be more than 50 cycles, depending on the CPU.  You  
should also remember than in filesystems many "failures" are  
triggered by things like the ld.so library searches, where it  
literally calls access() 20 different times on various possible paths  
for library files, failing the first 19.  It does this once for each  
necessary library.
Typically you only want to add unlikely() or likely() for about 2  
reasons:
   (A)  It's a hot path and the unlikely case is just going to burn a  
bunch of CPU anyways
   (B)  It really is extremely unlikely that it fails (Think physical  
hardware failure)
Anything else is just bogus.
Cheers,
