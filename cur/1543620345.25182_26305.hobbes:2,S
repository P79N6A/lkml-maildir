   I'd rather see rmap go in in its simplest possible form, outperforming the
   current virtual scanning method on basic page replacement performance, rather 
   that using the other things we know rmap can do as the argument for inclusion.
   It's for this reason that I'm concentrating on the fork speedup.
Ok, but just keep in mind that failing for < 3 order page allocations
would be a regression from what is in there now.
