I know that's it's possible to resync the TSCs, but:

As you say you cannot use it to do timing unless you disable any power
management on the CPU. Otherwise you can count the elapsed ticks but
you cannot convert the number to anything meaningful.
You may be able to emulate rdtsc for userspace but then again the
whole point of using rdtsc is that it should be uber-fast... if rdtsc
is emulated then you can just use gettimeofday (which is also
optimized to be *very* fast). No?
