Subject: problem burning DVDs with 2.6.17-ck1 (mlockall?)

After upgrading from 2.6.16-ck11 to 2.6.17-ck1, I find I can no longer
burn DVDs. With growisofs I get:
:-( unable to anonymously mmap 33554432: Resource temporarily unavailable
and dvdrecord gives:
dvdrecord: Cannot allocate memory. WARNING: Cannot do mlockall(2).
This happens as root or as a normal user. I have tried both "echo 0 >
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio" and "echo 9 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio" with
no change in this behavior.
memtester works fine:
