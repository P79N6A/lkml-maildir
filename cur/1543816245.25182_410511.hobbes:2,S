Actually SRP (which T10 has now stopped working on) fits the bill very
nicely.
I have to say that moving the IBM virtual drivers from a random
collection of unique drivers (viodisk, viotape, viocd) to a single
virtual SCSI HBA made life much easier.
There is a group (actually, at least two groups) working on SCSI
target infrastructures...once that is in place, I would expect we
could start hacking a Xen virtual HBA.
We looked at iSCSI as a transport (instead of SRP) but we felt that 
the added complexity made it unlikely that the average human could
successfully boot their virtual machine
