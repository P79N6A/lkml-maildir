Then it's a bug for the ethtool maintainer. ethtool.c #includes 
ethtool-copy.h, a renamed copy of the kernel header file.
I'm familiar with the deprecation and continue to be bewildered by 
it. To take this particular example, ethtool.h defines an interface 
between a kernel facility and a userspace client. What's the 
non-deprecated method of sharing the interface definition?
