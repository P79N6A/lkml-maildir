i don`t wonder here - how should one know that it`s an edd problem if all he sees is a blank screen with a blinking cursor in the upper left ?
so i assume, "Linux EDD Boot hang" isn`t the best term for searching here.
i think, there is no universal search phrase - i found some references with different words (linux install, blank screen, blinking cursor....)
some of them

not sure if really all of them are the edd problem i have, but i`m quite sure for some of those.
can provide more links if somebody likes.

i wouldn`t call that problem obscure.
i have seen this problem more than 5 times since that code is in linux. so it`s at least enough to discuss about even if no other person thinks it`s necessary :)  just the fact that it`s not been discussed often (here or elsewhere) doesn`t mean, that it exist or that users come across that. it`s more that type of "mhh, let`s try linux instead of windows. oh, doesn`t boot. ok, let`s stay with windows then...". you don`t expect people like those posting the right question to the right forum, do you?

mhh. i`m unsure. ok, i`m no kernel-hacker but there are so many variants of bios/hardware out there so blacklisting certain bios versions may be never more than half of a solution.
