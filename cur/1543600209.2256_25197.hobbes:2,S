As far as I know, this has been broken for quite a while.  You need to apply
the patches at 
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/
 (specifically the seekdir
patch), as well as supply the 32bitclients option to the IRIX NFS server in
2.4.9.  Previous 2.4.X kernels didn't require the 32bitclients option on the
IRIX server for some reason.
After doing both of these things, everything appears to work properly over
here in my testing.
