Yes, look at the skge driver in 2.6.15 and the upcoming sky2 in 2.6.16.
I think you'll find those drivers much better than sk98lin and support most if 
not all of the cards that the sk98lin driver works with.  Certainly those two 
replacement drivers are better maintained.
My understanding is that is that sk98lin is in the process of being deprecated.
