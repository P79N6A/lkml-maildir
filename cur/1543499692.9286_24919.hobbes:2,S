I worked on a PDP11/60 running "unix". The PDP was installed around
'75 or '76. It was running Unix by the time I worked on it ('86). 
I remember for sure that mkdir wasn't a syscall on this machine. There
was a setuid mkdir binary that did the magic for you. You could
hardlink to directories, you could chmod files into a directory. Both
were not allowed for normal users, and the system tools would require
an "-f" to force them to do it, even if you were root (for sure on the
ln. I don't remember the chmod).
I remember the setuid mkdir doing something along the lines of:
	touch $1
	chmod 40755 $1
	ln $1 $1/.
	ln . $1/..
I remember that after a system crash we ended up with lots of junk in
lost+found. Some of the FILEs there looked quite similar to what you'd
see if you would use cat on a directory. So we chmod-ed them into a
directory, and fsck-ed again. Bingo! a whole bunch of files back...
Yes, those were the days....
But what the F... is all this doing on linux-kernel?
