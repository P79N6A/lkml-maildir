Maybe your CPU is overheating or it's not getting enough current.
Both oopses happen at the same exact address and they are complete
nonsense.  For #1, the instruction is valid (it's
cmpl $1,0x38d67d(%rip)) and for #2 it's the same instruction, which
can't be referencing address 1.
You can try slowing down your CPUs by doing:
# echo -n "powersave" >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/cpufreq/scaling_governor
for each cpu (assuming you have a driver loaded, and you should.)
And please post your complete .config
