Mike,
I just sent you the name, email, url of my APCC UPS reseller.
Send him a message, buy some batteries, and get out of a jam.
Here it is again for you and anyone else, that need it.

Then lets move the UPS off topic to the list that deal solely with APCC
products, my (me + et. al) software package "apcupsd".
If you have a bug, problem, gripe, comment, suggestion, fix, or any other
related issue to these to items, please report it there.  You will have
access to the development/porting/etc. team to assist you and anyone else.
To subscribe, send "subscribe apcupsd-devel" to majordomo@ro.com

Do this before I catch some heat for an OT that I did pour a glass 
or two of gasoline upon.
Thanks............
