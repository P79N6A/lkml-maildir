These are some more updates to fsstack.
The first patch makes fsstack_copy_attr_all copy the inode size in addition
to all the other attributes.
The second patch introduces generic structures and functions to get/set
lower objects.
The third patch converts eCryptfs to use the generic structures and
functions introduced by the second patch.
For those interested, I set up a git repo with all the fsstack related
patches currently in mm and these three (they're still being mirrored):
