No its intentional and was discussed. Both of them provide an identical
platform driver interface, so they both use the same name. This means an
embedded platform developer doesn't have to choose which driver each of
their downstream users gets.
Probably just needs a bit of ifdef twiddling, if its even a bug (which is
not clear).
