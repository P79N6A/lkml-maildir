Yes, I mentioned that those kinds of benchmarks are not the workload
we're shooting for in the second part of the message. The commentary
regarding dbench et al on tmpfs suggests that the lower-level parts of
the algorithm are sound, but are somehow driven inappropriately or in a
manner unaligned with what locality of reference there may be.
