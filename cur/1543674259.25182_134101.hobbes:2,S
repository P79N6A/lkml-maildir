That is a problem.
Generally, adding new code in codepaths which lots of apps use is low-risk
because problems will be found quickly.
But from a stabilising-the-kernel viewpoint, adding new code which does not
require elevated privileges, and which is not used by any current
applications and which doesn't even have a decent test suite is a big
worry.
There is a little testcase in
http://www.kvack.org/~bcrl/aio/aio-userspace-18a.tar.gz
 but it is singly
threaded.
