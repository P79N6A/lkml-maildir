Thanks for all who have answered my original question. Among other things, I
tried what Alan told me ( to install 2.2.14 ) but with no success. Late on, I
tried to define a bogus configuration of heads, sectors and cylinders in the
Lilo disk section with no success ( also on 2.2.14 ). 
Tonight I'll try to pass the linear parameter to LILO ( didn't have a lot of
time lately to start another rebooting ). If that doesn;t work, then I'll try
either DOS fdisk, Partition Manager, or OnTrak Disk Manager. Hopefully, I'll
have success with some of this.
I don't believe that the BIOS is working bad ( as it recognizes the hard drive
). However, I might be wrong.
