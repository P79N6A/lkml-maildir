Hello everyone,
 I have a problem around timer.
 The problem is ...
 The function do_nanotime() returns incorrect value.
 The value is 414528697ns longer than timer interval(10ms). It occurs few times a day.
 do_poor_nanotime() (in arch/i386/kernel/time.c) is called as do_nanotime().
 do_nanotime() is called within interrupt via rs_interrupt_single() (in drivers/char/serial.c).
 The kernel version is 2.4.21 with PPSKit 2.1.2.
 Architecture is i386 and MPU is PentiumIII 850MHz.
 My computer has two PPS inputs and there are connected to Rb Atomic Clock.
 Does anyone has some advices for resolv this problem?
 Thanks.
