Hi,
 I briefly looked at the PI code. Looks fine. I will try it on my
rt-mutex testbed soonish.
However, I notice it re-introduces long latencies :-(
The problem is that the time need in adjust_prio_chain is proportional to
the lock depth and the function is called with two raw spinlocks held.
This is no problem when the locks are in the kernel and thus not very
deeply nested, but when it is exposed to futexes there is a problem as
Joe user can increase the task latency of the system by crafting deep
locking structures in userspace.
I will be on paternity leave soonish. I might get time solve it as I
originally suggested some months back when my daughter is asleep. The
solution I suggested last fall, includes releasing _all_ locks at each
iteration in the loop in adjust_prio_chain such that higher priority
tasks gets a chance to run. To avoid having tasks released in the middle
get/put_tast_struct() are needed. That will cost extra atomic
instructions compared to the present implementation. Are people prepared
to pay that price? I am not talking about the scheduler based solution;
just doing the PI iteration in a little different (and slightly more
epensive) way.
