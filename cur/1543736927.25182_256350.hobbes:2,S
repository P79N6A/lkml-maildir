Unrelated to the CLOCK_PROCESS/THREAD_CPUTIME_ID discussion, just wanted 
to comment on the 'patches inline vs attached' bit.

Not all mailers show attachments inline. Mailers that do usually depend on 
the mimetype of the attachment when choosing to show inline or not. pine 
(my personal favorite) show attachments with a text/plain and similar 
mime-type inline, but a not all mailers use that (I see a lot of attached 
patches on lkml that don't show inline, and that's somewhat annoying).
It's also harder to reply and comment on bits of a patch when your mailer 
does not include attachments inline in a reply (even if it did show them 
inline while reading the mail).
Having to save the patch, open it in a text editor and then cut'n'paste 
bits of it into the reply mail is a pain. Same goes for having to save & 
open it in order to read it in the first place.
