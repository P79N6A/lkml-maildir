Hustin, if you're after speed, AND sane support, you may consider trying 
Areca products. I'm biased, since 3ware fed me up completely, when it came 
to a single drive failure in a RAID 5 setup: the support only provides an 
ugly web interface: when posting my problem, they replied with:

Well, they responded within 23-26 hours on average, only to request 
information, that was given in the very first post! In the end (a week 
later) they concluded: the problem cannot be solved without replacing the  
firmware and reinstalling the array! The array couldn't be restored from 
degraded mode - they blamed the samsung drives for it. 
Since then I replaced all my 3ware controllers with Areca controllers and 
haven't regretted it, but I haven't done any serious measurement (I mostly 
care for reliability, btw) but they where noticably faster.
Cheers,
Pete
