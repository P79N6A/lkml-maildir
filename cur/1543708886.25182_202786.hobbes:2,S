Subject: [PATCH] performance problem with established hash

Hi,
An HTTP stress test on latest 2.6 BK shows up a problem in tcp_r4_rcv:
15.0125  tcp_v4_rcv
 8.2719  e1000_xmit_frame
 3.2153  qdisc_restart
 3.1675  skb_release_data
15% in tcp_v4_rcv, ouch. It turns out almost all of this is walking the
established hash looking for stuff in time wait:
        /* Must check for a TIME_WAIT'er before going to listener hash. */
        sk_for_each(sk, node, &(head + tcp_ehash_size)->chain) {
                if (TCP_IPV4_TW_MATCH(sk, acookie, saddr, daddr, ports, dif))
                        goto hit;
        }
Looking at the logic for sizing the established hash, we clamp at 10
pages. That doesnt sound right:
        if (num_physpages >= (128 * 1024))
                goal = num_physpages >> (21 - PAGE_SHIFT);
        else
                goal = num_physpages >> (23 - PAGE_SHIFT);
        if (!thash_entries)
                goal = min(10UL, goal);
        else
                goal = (thash_entries * sizeof(struct tcp_ehash_bucket)) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
Sure enough things arent happy:
Older 2.6 kernel:
	TCP: Hash tables configured (established 262144 bind 65536)
Current 2.6 BK:
	TCP: Hash tables configured (established 4096 bind 4096)
It looks like the hash clamping patches wanted to clamp at 1 << 10, not
10. Patch below.
