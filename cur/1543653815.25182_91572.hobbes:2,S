	When a Linux machine has reached the tcp_mem limit, what will happen to 
'write's on non-blocking sockets? Will they block until more TCP memory is 
available? Will they return an error code? ENOMEM?
	If it varies by kernel version, details about different versions would be 
extremely helpful. I'm most interested in late 2.4 kernels.
	Thanks in advance.
	DS
