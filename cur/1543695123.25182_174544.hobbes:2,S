While suspended should the notion monotonic time be incrementing? If
we're not incrementing jiffies, then uptime isn't being incremented, so
to me it doesn't follow that the monotonic time should be incrementing
as well. 
It may very well be a POSIX timers spec issue, but it just strikes me as
odd.
