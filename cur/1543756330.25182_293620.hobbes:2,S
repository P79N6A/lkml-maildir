Ah...thanks for the warning.
We want to eventually make it work with swap as well, but that's 
substantially more complicated.

I understand the reluctance.  I'm perfectly willing to export it GPL in 
my private branch as long as you guys don't consider it evil--the module 
is going to be GPL anyways.
The alternative would be for me to build my code directly in to the 
kernel...just makes it harder for me to debug.
