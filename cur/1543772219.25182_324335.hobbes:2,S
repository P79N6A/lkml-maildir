Ahh.. I was reading the Kconfig, which says this:
menu "TCP congestion control"
# TCP Reno is builtin (required as fallback)
config TCP_CONG_BIC
        tristate "Binary Increase Congestion (BIC) control"
        depends on INET
        default y
and I built with:
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_BIC=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_WESTWOOD=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_HTCP=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_HSTCP=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_HYBLA=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_VEGAS=m
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_SCALABLE=m
so what I *expected* was a kernel with Reno built-in, and the others as
modules if I got ambitious and loaded one or another.
How do people feel about this:
