Hmm. Slightly awkward to check - it's a modular system with libata in 
initramfs, so getting parameters in may be a pain. However, there's 
nothing on the legacy IDE controller - should combined mode actually 
make a difference in that case? As I said, ahci works fine - the problem 
only occurs with ata_piix. The MAP register indicates that combined mode 
isn't in use.
