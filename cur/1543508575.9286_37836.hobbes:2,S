My own selfish reason:   I can't test 2.3.x kernels on my fileserver
because I initially installed w/ a RedHat+RAID kernel (RH6.0 stock), and
now can't do without my RAID mirror.  :)
A change went into 2.3.17 marking knfsd non-experimental.  Comment from
fs/Config.in:
"considering that RedHat-6.0 ships with this on, I guess it's not really
experimental"
Hopefully the same logic can be applied to the RAID patches.  :)  I
stress my RAID1 mirror a ton but it hasn't broken yet.
