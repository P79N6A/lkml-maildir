I looked again at the definition of the difference between ctime and 
mtime on the stat man page, and I think that updating ctime in response 
to rename is as reasonable as updating it in response to changing the 
number of links.
Ok, we will conform, and I will accept the kindly donated patch, along 
with Andrew's optimization of our evaluation of CURRENT_TIME.  vs, 
please add Andrew's suggested optimization and sent the result through 
QA.  Thanks to all for your good advice.
