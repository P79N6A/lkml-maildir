I'm glad that you have done this work, and I look forward to merging it 
with the power management infrastructure work I have been doing. However, 
there are several outstanding issues.

I will not take the code which still relies on the page flag bits. I look
forward to your dynamic bitmap implementation. 
As for the current patch, I was unable to test its actual functionality, 
which I will get to in a moment. 
First, I request that you please name the patches something sensible that 
won't collide with anything else, like swsusp-2.5.66-<n>.diff, not 
'patch-2.5.66-<n>.diff'.
Also, please make it explicitly clear which patch(es) are needed for 
download. On the sourceforge site, both -01 and -02 are highlighted as 
current, though they appear to different versions of the same thing. 
I'm glad to hear that you have completed the full port, but many people 
appreciate incremental patches, especially if the cumulative changes 
touch multiple parts of the kernel. Please consider breaking the one large 
patch into multiple, easily digestible, chunks. 
Finally, with either patch, there are unresolved symbols:
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o: In function `do_suspend_lowlevel':
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x1644): undefined reference to `save_processor_state'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x164a): undefined reference to `saved_context_esp'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x164f): undefined reference to `saved_context_eax'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x1655): undefined reference to `saved_context_ebx'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x165b): undefined reference to `saved_context_ecx'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x1661): undefined reference to `saved_context_edx'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x1667): undefined reference to `saved_context_ebp'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x166d): undefined reference to `saved_context_esi'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x1673): undefined reference to `saved_context_edi'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.data+0x167a): undefined reference to `saved_context_eflags'
The fix is likely trivial, but it is annoying that it happens in the first 
place.
Thanks,
