Rereading this, I should clarify.  We definitely have the distinction.
In the case of direct I/O, you get synchronousness, no page caching, and
no use of buffers.  In my statement, I meant that you cannot separate
the "no page cache" from the "synchronousness" attribute.
But you can get synchronous I/O and still get the page cache, ala
O_SYNC.
The closest you can come to normal I/O without the page cache is by
doing posix_fadvise() to prune your cache pages after you touch them.
That is definitely not what you want.
