mutter.
We've given people years of notice and _some_ applications have converted
over to open("/dev/sda1", O_DIRECT), as they should.
Sure, it's a small and simple driver (now), so the cost of maintaining it
is low.
But otoh, there's no reason for it to exist, except for userspace
sluggishness.
So we can either give up, or we can push on: put a rude printk in there
somewhere and who knows, maybe in five years time we can finally be rid of
the thing.
