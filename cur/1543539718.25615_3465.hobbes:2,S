It drops root privileges once it is up and running.

You have the source to X -- they are not up to anything devious or
would have been found out by now IMO, and iopl() does not give it the
ability to regain CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  
It is too large to verify line by line on one's own I grant, and the
binary only modules for XFree86-4.* are an abominable plot against
Free software, but I have 3.3.6 and plan to do my own X hacking from
now on if that is the way it is going to be.

"You can not please everybody, so you got to please yourself"
You can disable iopl() once you no longer need it though is the point.
(I love X -- I have 5 X servers scattered about the house all logged
into my main server, with networked sound, a single Emacs displaying
on all computers -- it is a hackers paradise which no other GUI has
ever approached to my knowledge.)
