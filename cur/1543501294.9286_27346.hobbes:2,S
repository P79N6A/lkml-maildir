You are arguing that your method is superior, when my method has
not lost a single Linux kernel message in 2 years since I've been
on the list.  Pointless...

There is nothing mysterious about the macro at all.  Read the
documentation.

It is not my macro.  It is built into procmail.  Someone
suggested that I use it, as it works well, and after I discovered
it, I tried it out on several mailing lists for which I could not
get every single message to filter properly, and the TO macro did
it perfectly.
