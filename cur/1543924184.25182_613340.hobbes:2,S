Larry Woodman managed to wedge the VM into a state where, on his
4x dual core system, only 2 cores (on the same CPU) could get the
zone->lru_lock overnight.  The other 6 cores on the system were
just spinning, without being able to get the lock.
On the other hand, spinlock contention in the page replacement
code is just a symptom of the fact that we scan too many pages.
It can probably be fixed in other ways...
