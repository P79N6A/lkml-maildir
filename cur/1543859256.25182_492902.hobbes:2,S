No, there were actually two different problems, and to confuse people, 
they had the same _symptoms_.
Commit 0e75f9063f5c55fb0b0b546a7c356f8ec186825e introduced a bug where 
SG_IO wouldn't copy the data back to user space correctly, which was why 
you got various tools like "dvd+rw-mediainfo" (and probably smartctl too) 
breaking.
That was also probably why bisection didn't pick out the right commit for 
the _other_ bug: it was effectively masked by the same problem, so the 
fact that commit f38621b3109068adc8430bc2d170ccea59df4261 fixed the sense 
info details and broke hddtemp was not visible as a bug, because the sense 
info was _more_ corrupted by the other bug, and thus "git bisect" walked 
back to where the _first_ bug was introduced, rather than the second one.
Anyway, sounds like hddtemp was just buggy.
