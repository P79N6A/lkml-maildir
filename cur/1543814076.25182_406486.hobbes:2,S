Yep, that one's a turkey, definitely something for Linus to revert.
Seeing your report, I gave 2.6.16-rc6-git2 a try at concurrent kernel
builds on dual HT EM64T: collapsed in all kinds of weird page table
corruption or slab corruption within minutes, three boots in a row.
Backed out that patch and it's going fine for half an hour now.
Andi, if you've a replacement patch you'd like everybody to test,
please post: I for one will surely give it a try.
