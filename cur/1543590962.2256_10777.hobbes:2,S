Today's patch has the first part of that fix:
    
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/dx.pcache-2.4.4-6
I broke up Al's check_page routine into the page-specific part and the 
dirent-specific part, which I call every time a buffer is brought 
uptodate in ext2_bread.  This is roughly as efficient as Al's 
page-oriented check.  I could get rid of the code in Al's check_page 
that initializes sets the rec_lens of a new dir page to blocksize 
because I do that explicitly in ext2_add_entry now.  This will make it 
a little cleaner.
The next step is to try and incorporate the intelligence about the good 
parts of a bad dirent block into the entry lookup code cleanly.
I moved ext2_bread and ext2_append into dir.c because of their 
dir-specific nature.  (I have some plans for ext2_getblk that have 
nothing to do with directories, which is why I'm trying to keep it 
generic.)
