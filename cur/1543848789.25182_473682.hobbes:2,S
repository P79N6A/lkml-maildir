Do you mean 'CROSS_COMPILE' ?

CC with friends is set like this:
+--[linux/Makefile]
|[...]
|AS		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)as
|LD		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
|CC		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
|CPP		= $(CC) -E
|[...]
+--
So, i think, you must set 'CROSS_COMPILE' first and then 'CC' like this:
(exporing PATH in shell, of course)
+--
$ make CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-pc-linux- 'CC=distcc $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc'
+--
(BTW, it's funny to see arch-*unknown*-linux...
Like something is deeply hidden and is a very big secret ;)
