I think we're saying the same thing in different words here ...
Note that an acpi_get_gendev_handle() or map_device_addr_to_acpi_handle()
function doesn't *preclude* putting a void * in struct device.  It does
let us choose whether or not to do so.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
