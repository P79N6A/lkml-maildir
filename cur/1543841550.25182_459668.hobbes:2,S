Yes it will.  See Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt for how it works.

those options _are_ module parameters, and as such work just fine with
the modprobe config files.

Ah, you want it after the code is loaded.  That's different.
Would probably work just fine, no objection from me.  Except you would
have to hack up the module-init-tools package :)
