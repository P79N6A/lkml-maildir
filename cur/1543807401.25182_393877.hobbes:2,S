in other words: the spreading out likely _hurts_ performance in the 
typical case (which prefers node-locality), but when you are using 
multiple cpusets you want to opt for fairness between projects, over 
opportunistic optimizations such as node-local allocations. I.e. the 
spreading out, as it is used today, is rather a global fairness setting 
for the kernel, and not really a workload-specific access-pattern thing.  
Right?
