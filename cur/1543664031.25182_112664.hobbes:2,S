Yes - pretty high, the feral driver is defaulting to 63 (comments there
say "FIX LATER"). Changing it to 8 gave much improved performance. 
I'm on a slightly different kernel, anyway:
10 fsync writes of 200 mb to 10 separate disks, queue depth (TCQ) of 63 gave:
0.05user 37.14system 1:09.39elapsed 53%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1986major+3228minor)pagefaults 0swaps
10 fsync writes of 200 mb to 10 separate disks, queue depth of 8 gave:
0.05user 38.56system 0:32.71elapsed 118%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1986major+3228minor)pagefaults 0swaps
The total time dropped by almost half. vmstat numbers were much smoother.
It would be nice if a larger queue depth did not kill performance.
The larger queue depths can be nice for disk arrays with lots of cache and
(more) random IO patterns.
