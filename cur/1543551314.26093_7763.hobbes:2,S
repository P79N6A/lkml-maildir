Oh, come on. The kernel (or glibc for that matter) is not about "inline
asm()" at all! That is a tiny fraction of each. The kernel is different in
that it has lots of hardware-dependent code, which leads to some rather
strange contortions in C in order to be able to _avoid_ asm. The kernel
also moves forward a lot faster than glibc, and grows a lot. A bug in glibc
means an application goes down or screws up, a bug in the kernel can mean
masive data loss in no time at all.

Alan has stated that he is open to patches that fix overoptimizations and
other such bugs in the kernel, sent it to him. So should H. J. Lu do with
his patches posted earlier today.
