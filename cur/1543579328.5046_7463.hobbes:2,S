I think I have found the problem.  Here is a code snippet from the
benchmark Andrea posted.
void            oneatwork(int thr)
{
    int             i;
    while (!start)              /* don't disturb pthread_create() */
        usleep(10000);                                                          
    actthreads++;
    while (!stop)
    {
        if (count)
            totalwork[thr]++;
        syscall(158); /* sys_sched_yield() */                                   
    }                                                                           
    actthreads--;                                                               
    pthread_exit(0);
}                                                                               
Note that actthreads is a global variable which is being updated
by multiple threads without any form of synchronization.  Because
of this actthreads sometimes never goes to zero after all worker
threads have finished.  I changed actthreads to be an atomic and
used atomic operations to manipulate it.  With this change, I was
able to complete one round of testing which I had not been able to
do in the past.
Does anyone maintain this benchmark code?  The changes I indicate
above should be made.  If you need more specifics I can provide
them.
