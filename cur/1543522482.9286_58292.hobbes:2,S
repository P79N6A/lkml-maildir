I almost thought so. :)

That's the problem. Our hardware (I didn't design it..) uses the RTS, DTR
and CTS pins for communication and not the [TR]xD, because we didn't plan
to put a RS232 protocol chip on our hardware (too little data). I regret
this descision now - but it cannot be changed (deadline = Feb 1.)...
Details (documentation draft) in German are available at

That's nice to hear. Then I'd like to know what makes the difference. You
are invited to look at it yourself here, we'd even give you a free lunch
:)

Exactly. Strangely, the port status LEDs (we put a serial test circuit on
the port for checking - basically 25 red/green LEDs) were in "Linux mode"
on bootup, and changed only to "QBasic mode" when the QB app was executed
first time. Then, reboot to Linux, they changed back to "Linux mode" when
any application tried to access any serial port - e.g. gpm, setserial, or
our application. And stayed there.

IIRC, we tried both, but I'll CC this to Guido (who actually did all the
testing and programming) and might be able to explain more details.

I'll double-check this.

This kind of support is what I like with Linux. :) The alternative would
have been MS Virual C++ or something, so we'd all be happy to get this
running under Linux.
